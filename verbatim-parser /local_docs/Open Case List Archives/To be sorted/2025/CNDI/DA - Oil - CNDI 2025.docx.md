**Lawler '25** (Alex Lawler and Enes Tunagur," World oil demand to keep
growing this decade despite 2027 China peak, IEA says," June 17, 2025,

LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Global [[oil demand will keep **growing**
until]{.mark} around [the end of this decade]{.mark}]{.underline}
despite peaking in top importer China in 2027, [as cheaper gasoline and
[slower electric vehicle adoption]{.mark} in the United States [support
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, the International Energy Agency said
on Tuesday.

[[Despite]{.mark} seeing an earlier [demand peak for China, the
IEA]{.mark}]{.underline}, which advises industrialised countries,
[[stuck to its prediction]{.underline}]{.mark} that global demand will
peak by 2029. This view sharply contrasts with that of producer group
OPEC, which says consumption will keep growing for much longer.

Oil demand will peak at 105.6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2029 and
then fall slightly in 2030, a table in the Paris-based IEA\'s annual
report shows. At the same time, global production capacity is forecast
to rise by more than 5 million bpd to 114.7 million bpd by 2030.

[A [conflict between Israel and Iran]{.mark} has highlighted the risk to
Middle East supplies, [helping send **oil prices up**
5%]{.mark}]{.underline} to above \$74 a barrel on Friday. Still, the
latest forecasts suggest ample supplies through 2030 if there are no
major disruptions, the IEA said.

[\"[Based on the fundamentals, oil markets look set to be well-supplied
in the years ahead]{.mark}]{.underline},\" said IEA Executive Director
Fatih Birol in a statement. \"But recent events sharply highlight the
significant geopolitical risks to oil supply security,\" Birol said.

In a separate report on Tuesday, which included a commentary on the
market impact of the Israel-Iran conflict, the IEA said the world market
looks well supplied this year in the absence of a major disruption as
growth in supply exceeds that of demand.

[Global supply in 2025 will rise by 1.8 million bpd]{.underline}, up
200,000 bpd from last month, the IEA said. This is partly because OPEC+,
which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus
Russia and other allies, is raising output.

World demand in 2025 will rise by a much lower 720,000 bpd, the IEA
said, down 20,000 bpd from last month\'s forecast.

CHINA PEAK

After decades of leading global oil demand growth, China\'s contribution
is sputtering as it faces economic challenges as well as making a big
shift to EVs.

The world\'s second-largest economy is set to see its oil consumption
peak in 2027, following a surge in EV sales and the deployment of
high-speed rail and trucks running on natural gas, the IEA said. In
February, it predicted China\'s demand for road and air transport fuels
may have already peaked.

China\'s total oil consumption in 2030 is now set to be only marginally
higher than in 2024, the IEA said, compared with growth of around 1
million bpd forecast in last year\'s report.

By contrast, lower gasoline prices and slower EV adoption in the United
States, the world\'s largest oil consumer, have boosted the 2030 oil
demand forecast by 1.1 million bpd compared with the previous
prediction, the IEA said.

U.S. electric vehicles are now expected to account for 20% of U.S. total
car sales in 2030, down from 55% assumed last year, the report said.

[Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald [Trump]{.mark} has
demanded OPEC lower oil prices and [has taken aim at EVs]{.mark} through
steps such as signing resolutions approved by lawmakers barring
California\'s EV sales mandates.]{.underline}

Given the lack of market signals on the one hand, and the significant
impact if carbon market risks are realised on the other, it may be
important to consider the implications of an uncertain future for fossil
fuel demand. Under [[a climate-optimistic scenario]{.underline}]{.mark},
a dramatic [[shift away from fossil fuels would be
expected]{.underline}.]{.mark} Meanwhile a climate-pessimistic scenario
would also be costly for many developing nations. While extensive
research examines the expectation of threats posed by climate change,
the probability and impact of the climate-optimistic scenario. Although
the Paris COP21 talks provided some indication of future policies,
[there remains]{.underline} significant [uncertainty]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} how [this will actually happen]{.underline}. The
[lack of certainty creates]{.underline} a [mismatch]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} the [opportunities]{.underline} [to develop and
invest]{.underline} in resources (Mitchell et al. 2015). This paper
argues that [even in the face of considerable uncertainty]{.underline},
[countries]{.underline} [should consider]{.underline} these three
[challenges]{.underline} since the impact, if it occurs, will be severe.
THE SCALE OF THE CARBON MARKET RISK FOR FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCERS THE
WORLD'S CARBON BUDGET AND STRANDED RESERVES Fossil fuels may be
plentiful from a geological point of view, but if the world burns all
available fossil fuels the impact on the climate will be severe.
Emerging research suggests that the world should aim to restrict the
accumulated carbon and other greenhouse gases emitted between 2011 and
2050 to 1,100 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (McGlade and
Ekins, 2014; Allen et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2015, Meinhausen et al.
2009). This limit is referred to as the world's 'carbon budget'.
Breaking this budget significantly risks deteriorating global
environmental and social conditions and 'runaway' climate change---in
which natural positive feedback loops contribute to ever greater climate
change effects. In comparison, the estimated combustible carbon dioxide
content of the world's reserves3 of oil, gas, and coal in 2014 was 2,900
gigatonnes (McGlade and Ekins 2014). Therefore, [[to avoid
using]{.underline}]{.mark} up [[the world's carbon budget and
causing]{.underline}]{.mark} extreme [[climate change, **two thirds** of
existing fossil fuel **reserves** must remain **undeveloped**.]{.mark}
Keeping two thirds of reserves]{.underline} in the ground necessitates a
significant [reduction in the world's use of fossil fuels]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn,
[[necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark} a long-term [[decline
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for]{.underline} fossil fuels, which [could occur if governments impose
**carbon taxes** or similar **policies**]{.underline}4 ; [[if there
is]{.underline} a [broad **transition** to **alternative
energy**]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies, such as nuclear or renewables;
[[or if economic activity becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly
[[more efficient]{.underline}]{.mark} in using energy.
[Reserves]{.underline} may also [remain **undeveloped**]{.underline} if
governments impose policies to limit the market supply of fossil fuel
resources. 5 [[A fall in fossil fuel **demand**]{.underline}]{.mark},
other things equal, [[will lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[fall in
fossil fuel **prices**]{.mark}. This might lead to]{.underline} existing
[reserves]{.underline} [remaining]{.underline} undeveloped or
**['stranded]{.underline}**'. Meanwhile [projects]{.underline} [that
remain]{.underline} commercially [viable will be **less valuable**.
This]{.underline} in turn [may]{.underline} [diminish]{.underline} the
[rents and]{.underline} therefore [tax revenues]{.underline} fossil fuel
extraction [can generate]{.underline} for [producing
countries]{.underline}. To understand this, [consider]{.underline} an
example from [the global oil market]{.underline}. The price received for
a barrel of oil is roughly the same for all projects after accounting
for relatively small differences in the quality of oil (such as
viscosity) and transport costs. However, costs will differ considerably
across location and geology. Figure 2 shows a representative global
supply curve that ranks all oil projects from least to most expensive in
terms of unit costs of production. For any given market price, lower
cost projects, on the left part of the supply curve, will have a higher
asset value per barrel than high cost projects. [If the]{.underline}
[producer price falls]{.underline}, say [in response to a climate
policy]{.underline}, some [projects]{.underline} with costs higher than
the prevailing price [will become stranded,]{.underline} while some
[value of]{.underline} all [remaining operating projects will be
foregone]{.underline}. Asset stranding and significant
[falls]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [values]{.underline} in the fossil
fuel industry [are not **new**]{.underline}, the recent commodity price
slump has stranded many projects already and fossil fuel companies have
seen the value of their assets reduced by many millions of dollars.
However, [the scale of such]{.underline} an outcome under, for example,
[an effective global climate policy would be]{.underline} entirely [new.
It would]{.underline} also [imply]{.underline} a
**[permanence]{.underline}** not normally considered during commodity
price slumps. For example, figure 3 shows estimates of the proportion of
reserves already discovered that could become permanently stranded if
the world keeps to its carbon budget. THE LIKELIHOOD OF CARBON MARKET
RISK Whether governments can implement effective climate policies to
reduce global fossil fuel consumption or whether alternative energy
sources gain sufficient market share is highly uncertain. This paper
does not directly address this uncertainty but assumes that the
probability is greater than zero. Further, [[even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[probability is
**low**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[**impact** on fossil-fuel rich
countries may be]{.underline}]{.mark} very
**[[large]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the reasons discussed. This has
some corollary to the so-called 'fat-tailed risk' or the 'precautionary
principle' of climate damages---where the probability of an impact is
low, but the impact itself is high, necessitating precautionary actions
(Weitzman 2011). Given these conditions fossil-fuel rich countries
should carefully consider how their policy choices might be modified by
carbon market risk and what type of, and how urgent, such precautionary
actions should be. We will address these policies in the final part of
this paper. The **[likelihood]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} a
permanent [fall]{.underline} [in]{.underline} fossil fuel
[demand]{.underline}, or 'carbon market risk' [rest on]{.underline} four
[factors]{.underline}. First, [government]{.underline}s of carbon
emitting countries [could impose policies]{.underline} [that keep
emissions]{.underline} [within the global carbon budget]{.underline}.
This could take the form of [demand-side policies, such as **consumer**
taxes, or supply-side measures such as **producer** taxes]{.underline}
or quantity restrictions, or some mix of these policies. The
[Paris]{.underline} COP21 [made some advance]{.underline} towards
countries imposing climate policies [but]{.underline} it
[is]{.underline} [unclear how the result]{.underline} of these
negotiations [will influence policy.]{.underline} Second, the [market
share of **renewables**]{.underline}, nuclear and other alternatives to
fossil fuels [could **increase** substantially]{.underline}. Solar and
wind power capacity has increased exponentially during the last decade,
although starting from a small base in comparison to fossil fuel-derived
energy. Currently 13 percent of global primary energy supply is from
renewables. Projected shares of renewable energy to total energy in 2030
in this share range from 14 percent---by Exxon---to 43 percent---by
Geotechnical and Environment Associates (Meister Consultants Group
2015). The International Energy Agency, an often quoted authority on the
subject, forecasts that renewables will still account for only 15
percent of global energy supply by 2040 (IEA 2015). However, the IEA has
consistently underestimated renewables growth in the past, and so can be
considered relatively pessimistic (Metayer et al. 2015) Third, [energy
efficiency measures could improve to reduce future energy
demand]{.underline}. There are signs that this will happen. [The
world]{.underline} [economy is gradually
'**decarbonising'**]{.underline}---greenhouse gas emissions per dollar
of GDP are falling. From 2000 to 2014, the carbon intensity of economic
activity has fallen by 1.3 percent each year on average, although total
greenhouse gas emissions are still rising as the global economy grew 3.7
percent a year on average over the same period (PWC 2015). This
decarbonisation trend is set to continue. The carbon intensity of the
Chinese economy, already the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the
world, fell by two percent in this period, and 6.7 percent in 2013 to
2014. In addition, Green and Stern (2015) forecast that Chinese carbon
emissions will peak by 2025. A fourth factor is the success or failure
of carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods---including both initiatives
to expand 'carbon sinks' such as forests, and technologies that directly
prevent carbon emission from entering the atmosphere. If these develop,
there is less need to restrict fossil fuel production for climate change
purposes: the carbon and other greenhouse gases can be removed from the
atmosphere and stored. However, CCS faces three problems: first, aside
from forests, man-made CCS methods are not currently commercially
viable; second, retrofitting CCS technologies to transport, power
stations and other carbon emitters appears prohibitively expensive; and
third, there is currently few viable methods to safely store carbon
without sufficiently reducing the risks of carbon leaking into the
atmosphere after being 'captured (Helm 2015)

[[Resource-rich countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, overwhelmed by income
from resource sales, [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} three
[[options]{.underline}]{.mark} that are listed here in decreasing order
of economic efficiency: (i) [[forced investment strategies that use
income for modernising the economy]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt to
prepare the country for a period in which income from resources falls,
but which may overstress the adaptation capacities of societies; (ii)
[i[nvestment in]{.mark}]{.underline} funds in
[[prep]{.underline}]{.mark}aration [[for periods of declining
sales]{.underline}]{.mark}; (iii) [[domestic use,
which]{.underline}]{.mark} in most cases [[overstresses the absorption
capacities]{.underline}]{.mark} of national economies and leads to price
hikes in local goods, endogenous deindustrialisation and a revaluation
of the currency, thus reducing national competitiveness. This follows
transfer theory (Samuelson, 1964; Balassa, 1964) and is the basis of
what is called the resource curse (Auty and Mikesell, 1993).2
[The]{.underline} three [strategies]{.underline} often [appear as
hybrids]{.underline}; however, dominant characteristics can be
identified. For example, Shah Reza Pahlavi applied the first strategy in
the 1960s and 1970s when trying to propel Iran into modernity. This
failed because of inner opposition but left the mullahs with a
formidable industry structure. Today, Norway commands one of the world's
largest investment funds. The Netherlands, on the other hand, spent gas
income on domestic programmes that led to price hikes followed by wage
increases in the non-tradable sector that subsequently spilled over into
manufacturing. The loss of competitiveness drove the rail, car and
aircraft industries out of the markets. It is known as the Dutch disease
or the East German disease because of the similar effects of the
stabilisation transfers from West Germany after unification (Blum,
2008). It is clear that the [loss of criticality will
**hit**]{.underline} a [type iii country hardest]{.underline}, and even
if type ii funds are available, they may be syphoned off. Moreover,
[this may]{.underline} completely [[**reverse** financial
flows]{.underline}]{.mark} in large countries and [[have a
**devastating** effect]{.underline}]{.mark} on international financial
stability. Oil has been a critical resource for a long time; however,
this is beginning to change. We use the Kingdom of **[[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a major oil]{.underline}
[producer]{.underline}, as a reference. The country [[is in **danger**
of **economic collapse** if **oil prices** suddenly
**fall**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- which is not beyond the realm of
possibility. The remainder of the article is organised as follows: In
the next section, we analyse the roots of crises from a resource
perspective. Using oil as an example, we point to the problem of
managing financial inflows efficiently and to the impact of geostrategic
rivalry. We then concentrate on two major factors that have led to a
regime change in the balance between global oil production and
consumption: fracking and defossilisation.3 We subsequently apply this
to Saudi Arabia and point to the medium- to long-term challenges for
global stability given this regime change. Finally, we conclude that a
[[substantial turnaround in]{.underline}
**[investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} management [[is
**required**]{.underline}]{.mark} of (Middle Eastern) oil-producing
countries [[to **guarantee** **global stability**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Geostrategic environment, critically, and crisis Cheap oil has promoted
the rapid industrialization of the Western world and benefited
oil-exporting countries by providing a sufficient influx of oil money,
especially to those that joined forces and co-founded the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set oil prices.4 Many of
these oil-rich countries have achieved oil-driven economic growth and
joined the group of middle- and high-income countries. [Oil has been a
critical energy resource]{.underline} since the 19th century. In 2018,
crude oil made up 33% of the world's annual primary energy consumption
(BP Energy, 2020). Since its wide industrial use from the late 19th
century onwards, partly due to Rockefeller's efforts to monopolise the
oil market and then the antitrust-led breakup of the Standard Oil
Company, global oil consumption and production have been steadily
increasing. In the 21st century, soaring demand in emerging economies
has compensated for the stagnating oil demand from the developed world.
Today, [oil]{.underline} still [has a]{.underline} relatively [**low
degree** of **substitution**]{.underline}, particularly [with respect to
**tech**]{.underline}nology (transport sector, chemicals)
[and]{.underline} **[transport]{.underline}** (large tankers,
pipelines). This guarantees a stable demand despite volatile prices.
Empirical [studies support]{.underline} the relatively [low price
elasticity]{.underline} of the global oil demand, especially in the
short run (Cooper, 2003; Caldara et al., 2016). [Due to]{.underline} its
[low **substitutability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
**[oligopolistic]{.underline}** [market]{.underline} [structure, oil has
provided]{.underline} its [suppliers with]{.underline} a steady stream
of [revenues]{.underline}. Having experienced an ever-increasing demand
for fossil fuel, the second half of the 20th century was besieged by the
economic threat of "peak oil". However, this concern about a negative
supply shock has now mainly shifted to "peak demand". According to
recent predictions, [oil's dominance]{.underline}, and therefore
criticality, [will **decrease** rapidly]{.underline} in the coming 30
years. The [main driver of]{.underline} th[is]{.underline} profound
[shift in mindset is environmental concerns]{.underline} about
greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, fracking turned the US from an
importer to an exporter of oil and gas. This has not only put pressure
on prices, it decoupled the US strategically from the Middle East as a
military safeguard of global oil supplies. In response, Saudi Arabia
launched an oil price offensive, trying to drive the US fracturing
industry from the market and indirectly hitting its biggest regional
rival, Iran, in its strategy to modernise its industries. In fact, Saudi
Arabia had switched from swing pricing, which tries to pricing, which
tries to equilibrate oil prices to levels that satisfy both producers
and consumers, to limit pricing. The apparent oil price conflict
described above is not only a multipolar economic war (Blum, 2020), it
is also a hybrid military war in which economic rivalry serves as an
essential and embedded driver. US fracking has not only reduced the
scarcity on the international oil market, it has also reminded the
traditional supplier countries of the finiteness of their competitive
position, something which defossilisation is further eroding. Gundersen
(2020), for instance, calculates that the US import shock, reflecting
its domestic shale oil supply shock, accounts for 13% of the global oil
price variation from 2003 to 2015, while OPEC explains about 17% of this
variation. Saudi limit pricing led to a technology drive that more than
halved initial fracking costs from over US \$80 per barrel to about US
\$30 per barrel. Defossilisation and oil's path towards non-criticality
Since the 19th century, the temperature of the Earth has risen by 1.14
degrees Celsius, resulting in observable negative impacts on its
ecosystems. Climatologists today can identify a highly likely (95%)
causality between human activity and global warming (IPCC, 2014). If
carbon dioxid net emissions do not decrease, further warming will cause
irreversible damage to the environment. Compared to all anthropogenic
greenhouse gas sources, fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
accounted for about 78% of total emissions from 1970 to 2010 (IPCC,
2014). Therefore, the necessity of limiting global warming through
defossilisation gained political and social acceptance and led to the
2016 Paris Agreement. Its ultimate goal is to keep the rise in global
temperatures in this century to well below two degrees Celsius above the
pre-industrial level or even below 1.5 degrees Celsius. To meet this
goal, the entire world must achieve zero net carbon emissions by around
2065, with the odds of reaching the target exceeding 66% (Rogelj et al.,
2015). Recently, the German Constitutional Court ruled that government
implementation programmes must reflect the environmental positions of
younger generations, thus pressing for more realistic reduction plans
(BVerfG, 2021). A district court in The Hague ruled that Shell must
drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions because international
climate agreements are also binding to enterprises. All of this will put
additional pressure on oil prices. From another angle, the projected
expansion of renewables mirrors a potentially sharp reduction in the
market share of oil. During 2018 and 2020, renewable energy production
grew at an annual rate of 6%. If the climate targets are met by 2050,
the share of renewables in primary energy would increase from 4.7% to a
value between 44.3% and 59.2% according to BP's Energy Outlook (2020).
It further forecasts a 55% and 80% fall in oil demand in two intense
decarbonisation scenarios, meeting the target of two and 1.5 degrees
Celsius, respectively.6 The report also conjectured that oil demand
peaked already in 2018; henceforth, global oil demand would trend
downward. Following the World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2020), its "net zero
emissions by 2050" would lead to a fall in the present value of the
world's oil sector by almost 50% by 2040 compared to 2019, and
pre-COVID-19 consumption patterns would not be reached before 2023.
Shocks may drive up the price, e.g. as OPEC+ chooses to curb supply or
the Houthis attack Saudi facilities. However, for many oil-producing
countries, oil prices may just oscillate around their fiscal breakeven
oil prices (IMF, 2020). Vulnerability and the Saudi Arabia's position
Saudi Arabia is typical of a country that has earned its national wealth
from crude oil reserves. In the first decade of the new millennium,
Saudi Arabia was the number one global oil supplier. Later, the United
States overtook it and Russia with its fracking revolution. This is
depicted in Figure 2. As a result, despite the absolute increase in its
oil production, Saudi Arabia witnessed a shrinkage of its global oil
share. [[Saudi Arabia's oil revenues are substantial relative to its
economic size]{.underline}]{.mark}, as different indicators in Figure 3
document. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the oil sector
accounted for around 40% of Saudi Arabia's total GDP and contributed to
about three-quarters of its governmental revenues. [[In 2019, oil
revenues made up]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[64.1% of its government's
annual revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the oil sector contributed
over 40% to Saudi Arabia's real GDP. As a relatively small economy with
little industrial diversification, Saudi Arabia has to sell most of its
oil reserves to the rest of the world and is therefore intensively
engaged in the oil trade. In the new millennium, Saudi Arabia's
export-to-GDP ratio has averaged about 40%, 85% of which are mineral
exports. The [[high **importance** of oil in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
composition of [[Saudi Arabia's **GDP**]{.mark} is]{.underline} also
[depicted]{.underline} in Figure 4. [It [shows]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[enduring **problem** of phasing out oil]{.underline}
**[dependency]{.underline}**,]{.mark} which is difficult because oil
plays a major in fiscal stability. The IMF estimates that Saudi Arabia's
external and fiscal breakeven oil prices in 2020 are US \$45.3 and US
\$66 per barrel, respectively. Given the long-term price projections, a
depletion of Saudi Arabia's investment funds starts to become a reality.
Figure 5 shows Saudi Arabia's import and export structures in 2018 and
is proof of an oil and oil-derivative dependent industry structure that
finances a highly diversified import basket. In brief, Saudi Arabia is a
highly specialised Ricardian country that thrives on its comparative
advantage: oil. It exports resources in exchange for products that are
knowledge, capital and labour intensive. Intra-industry trade, which is
often observed in countries actively participating in global value
chains (GVCs), is less discernible. By producing first blue and later
green hydrogen, Saudi Arabia could try to set up a new pillar for
exports and use crude oil only as a material base for carbon-based
products, e.g. plastics. Over and above the limitations already apparent
in the export portfolio of oil-derivative commodities (Figure 5a),
limits may emerge from the ability to absorb the necessary investments
and geostrategic reliability. In fact, assuming a price of about US
\$1.5 per kg, exports would have to amount to some 128.67 billion kg.7
More is needed if other specialised products should replace present
exports like rubber or basic chemicals, such as ammonia. Investments in
the necessary hydrogen production facility would amount to US \$1,400
billion. At least another US \$400 billion should be added for the other
third of export production, i.e. green steal, ammonia (as currently
planned) or other chemicals. Over a period of 20 years, this would imply
annual capital expenditures of some US \$90 billion. They should be
larger in the early years, i.e. the 2020s, and decline later. As Saudi
Arabia would not be able to produce the necessary investment goods and
supply the necessary labour, the current account balance would come
under stress unless most of the investments are FDI financed. If
historic budget surpluses and, thus, investment into overseas funds are
reversed, the resulting impact on financial stability and on exports
from manufacturing countries could have the potential to trigger a
crisis.

[In the event of contentious anti-government uprisings]{.underline},
[the monarchy would feel pressured]{.underline} to offer change. The
most likely scenario would be the promotion of MBS, a reformer with a
great deal of youth support. This promotion is unlikely to quell elite
resentment and could further inflame tensions among the monarchy, rival
family members, and the religious establishment. If MBS offers liberal
reforms, he would likely lose the support of the ultra-conservative
Wahhabi clerics. Yet if he fails to provide reforms, resistance to the
Saudi rulers could grow based on regionalism and tribalism in the Hijaz,
Nejd, or the Eastern Province. Neither scenario bodes well for the
monarchy. Though he has a loyal following in the military, MBS's
military excursion in Yemen has received substantial criticism, creating
the conditions for a coup if destabilization escalates under his
stewardship. [[Hostile **elites** with competing clientele bases would
see **state collapse** as an opening for greater
**power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since the kingdom's unification in 1932,
an overarching Saudi identity has been elusive. Saudi nationalism is a
new concept. The state has been united by the cooptation of elites and
the promotion of Wahhabi ideology, which while popular in the Nejd
heartland faces rejection from the country's Shi'ite minority. Not all
Saudi Sunnis, meanwhile, practice this branch of Sunni Islam. [With an
**embattled**]{.underline} central [state]{.underline}, many [[tribal
**elites** would strive to **carve** out]{.underline}]{.mark} autonomous
[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}, restore their pre-unification authority,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[**dissolve** the modern Saudi
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. To exert their power, these tribal leaders
would draw defections from tribal kin in the armed forces. Disaffected
royal family members with their own loyal bases of support could also
openly challenge King Salman's successor (whoever that will be) if
instability persists. [In the face of significant social
upheaval]{.underline}, elite abandonment, and military defection, the
[SANG]{.underline} [could not]{.underline} realistically
[prevent]{.underline} [the state from sliding into civil war and
collapse]{.underline}. GCC states are aware of this scenario and
operational plans to contain this potential implosion are already under
consideration. Consequences for Region and the World The
**[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the Saudi state [would have
grave implications for the]{.mark}]{.underline} region and the
**[[world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As illustrated by **Libya**,
**Syria**, and **Yemen**]{.underline}, state [[collapse creates a vacuum
for radical]{.mark}]{.underline} jihadist [[groups]{.mark}]{.underline}
to claim new territory. Currently, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
([AQAP]{.underline}) is pushing against the Saudi border with Yemen and
the Islamic State ([ISIS]{.underline} or IS) in Iraq and Syria poses a
constant threat to the kingdom's north. Thus, civil war, instability,
and high levels of sectarian tension would likely be fertile ground for
these groups to grow and expand their control, threaten the holy sites,
and [perpetuate regional instability]{.underline}. Washington's national
security establishment has expressed concerns about turmoil escalating
in Saudi Arabia if MBS's reform agenda fails to achieve its objectives.
Some see the kingdom at a crossroads and fear that the kingdom's
collapse would benefit the Islamic State. Regarding MBS possibly
becoming the next king, one anonymous Saudi expert told NBC News, "It's
him or it's ISIS." The July 4 attacks in three Saudi cities (Medina,
Jeddah, and Qatif) underscored the significance of the militant
Salafist-Jihadist threat not only to the country's security but also Al
Saud's prestige and Islamic legitimacy as the Custodian of the Two Holy
Mosques. The intended attack by IS adherents on the Prophet's Mosque
during the end of Ramadan signals the Islamic State's intent to usurp
the Al Saud much as the apocalyptic leader Juhayman al-Otaybi did when
he seized the Grand Mosque in 1979. "This attack has made it very clear
that ISIS does not seem to believe in any moral red lines whatsoever,"
said Fahad Nazer, a leading expert on Saudi Arabia. "Even al-Qaeda,
which is certainly brutal in its own right, has never targeted Muslims
in their houses of worship. ISIS has done that repeatedly." [[A **civil
wa**]{.mark}**r**]{.underline} in the Arabian Peninsula
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}
long-standing **[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instability, the
threat to the holy cities, and the possibility of jihadist gains would
[[encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} states with high stakes [([**Egypt**,
**Jordan**, **Iran**, **Pakistan**, **U.S.**, etc.) to
**react**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, UAE officials have even made
contingency plans for a potential state collapse in Saudi Arabia, a risk
which none of the kingdom's neighbors can afford to ignore. These states
would certainly move to secure the holy sites and combat terror cells,
but solving the civil war would be a massive challenge. There would be
considerable pressure to support the Saud family, but supporting the
Wahhabi religious establishment over a reform movement would cause
domestic complications in some of these countries that resent the
kingdom's influence across the region. [Pakistan]{.underline}, [which
has a "special]{.underline} bilateral [relationship]{.underline}" with
Saudi Arabia **[obligating]{.underline}** [their military to defend
Mecca and Medina]{.underline} and protect Saudi Arabia's territorial
integrity, [would]{.underline} [face]{.underline} the most pressure to
[intervene **militarily**]{.underline} on behalf of the Saud government
should turmoil intensify. The two nations have a long history of
military and security cooperation, and there is little doubt that
Pakistan would act to protect the Al Saud rulers. In addition, the
Egyptian military is present in the northern border areas of Saudi
Arabia helping to augment Pakistani forces supporting SANG and the Saudi
border guard. Iran and Oil [The geopolitical tsunami]{.underline} that
would result from Saudi Arabia's collapse [would]{.underline} [have
enormous consequences regarding Iranian influence]{.underline} across
the region. From Iraq to Lebanon, and from Yemen to Syria, the struggle
on the part of hardline Sunni Islamists to counter Shi'ism and
[**Iran**'s reach would enter a **new phase**]{.underline} should Saudi
Arabia cease to exist as a unified nation-state. It is not entirely
clear how Iran would react to state-collapse in Saudi Arabia, especially
considering [instability]{.underline} in the region [would present a
**security risk** to shipping]{.underline} and trade in the Persian
Gulf. Although Iran would likely avoid direct involvement in a conflict
in the Arabian Peninsula, it would certainly attempt to capitalize on a
regional power vacuum created by a diminished Saudi Arabia by
consolidating its political and military influence in Yemen, Iraq,
Syria, Eastern Saudi Arabia, and, if instability spreads,
Shi'ite-majority Bahrain. [Diminished oil output]{.underline} by its
regional rival [would]{.underline} also [increase]{.underline}
[demand]{.underline} [for Iranian oil]{.underline}, [boosting their
economy]{.underline}. There is also no clear Sunni successor state to
check Iran's regional influence. Egypt's economy is too weak, and Jordan
is surrounded on all sides by instability. Finally, [[Saudi Arabia as a
**failed state** would send international markets into free
fall]{.underline}]{.mark}. State collapse in Saudi Arabia would halt oil
production, significantly increasing the price of oil and dramatically
weakening global economies. Such an increase would [spark [a
severe]{.mark}]{.underline} global **[[economic
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The longer Saudi Arabia is destabilized,
the more difficult it would be for the world to pull out of the crisis
and recover. The socio-political ramifications of such an economic shock
could [be **[catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline} and disastrous
[[for]{.mark}]{.underline} both the region and [[the
**world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the government faces large-scale
demonstrations calling for social and political liberalization while
facing tribal, familial, and religious elite abandonment, the result
could be instability, civil war, and/or state collapse.

**[UQ -- Oil High Now]{.underline}**

#### Oil strong now but markets are cautious -- any unforeseen changes trigger the link

- Middle east tensions and trade deals are keeping demand high.

oil outlook higher, but demand concerns persist: Reuters poll," June 30,

June 30 (Reuters) - [Analysts have marginally lifted their oil price
forecasts after]{.underline} the flare-up of [tensions in the Middle
East]{.underline}, but rising OPEC+ supply and a tempered demand outlook
continue to weigh on crude, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

A survey of 40 economists and analysts in June forecast Brent crude will
average \$67.86 per barrel in 2025, up from May\'s \$66.98 forecast,
while U.S. crude is seen at \$64.51, above last month\'s \$63.35
estimate. Prices have averaged roughly \$70.80 and \$67.50 so far this
year respectively, as per LSEG data.

The Iran-Israel conflict and the U.S[. decision to intervene have led to
sharp swings in oil prices this month]{.underline}, with Brent prices
touching \$81.40 before falling to settle at \$67.14 after the
ceasefire.

[\"We envisage the region will remain on edge for the time
being]{.underline}\... leading to some lingering volatility in oil
prices in coming days and weeks,\" said Suvro Sarkar, lead energy
analyst at DBS Bank.

However, many analysts saw price spikes from the conflict as temporary,
barring any serious escalation in the region. As long as Gulf production
stays online, rising OPEC+ output and comfortable inventories should
limit crude\'s rally, said Cyrus De La Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg
Commercial Bank.

\"[We expect prices to settle back toward fundamentals if the
Iran-Israel conflict does not broaden further,\"]{.underline} he added.

OPEC+ in May agreed to another increase of 411,000 barrels per day of
oil for July, bringing the total increases made or announced since April
to 1.37 million bpd. These increases are having a significant impact on
sentiment in a market already spooked by the impact of U.S. trade policy
on global demand, said Matthew Sherwood, lead commodities analyst at
EIU.

[\"We expect OPEC+ to exert caution in raising production, even putting
plans on hold indefinitely at the first signs that prices may fall
significantly]{.underline},\" Sherwood added.

[Meanwhile, analysts expect global oil demand to grow by an average of
over 730,000 bpd in 2025]{.underline}, compared to 775,000 bpd in last
month\'s poll. While the trade deal between the U.S. and China has
somewhat alleviated demand concerns, [markets are taking a cautious view
of its impact]{.underline}.

\"The US-China trade deal may modestly support oil demand by improving
market sentiment and trade flows, though its impact is likely to be
limited and shaped by broader economic and supply dynamics,\" said
Tobias Keller, analyst at UniCredit.

I. From the Big Push to a Long Push:

Vision 2030 and Beyond

Eight years ago, the Saudi Arabian government announced the most
ambitious plan yet to reduce the Kingdom's historical economic
dependence on oil. The implementation of [[Vision]{.mark} 2030
[has]{.mark} dramatically **[accelerated]{.mark}** since
**2022**]{.underline}, [[with **the current investment boom**
representing a]{.underline}]{.mark} classic "Big
**[[Push]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[towards
**diversification**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Gigascale
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** investments [[are complemented
by]{.mark} [**industrial policies** focused on **renewable
energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, refining, chemical production,
[and]{.underline} the Kingdom's abundance of [natural
resources]{.underline} beyond oil, while sweeping social, regulatory and
legal reforms target high-value service sectors, notably tourism,
technology and financial services. Recently, [the PIF]{.underline} has
[accelerated **venture**]{.underline}-style [**investments** in
**[biotech]{.mark}**]{.underline}, artificial intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), consumer services
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} automated
**[[manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- underlined by the
establishment of a \$40bn to \$100bn fund focused on AI investment,
[which would make the Kingdom a **dominant** global
investor]{.underline} in this area.

While much about Vision 2030 is pioneering and historic, the Big Push
approach to public investment has been a recurring feature in the
history of commodity-dependent economies. In the Middle East,
[**sustained commodity windfalls** have]{.underline} historically [been
accompanied by sharp increases in public investment to
**break**]{.underline} the region's historical **[oil
dependence]{.underline}**. Based on seminal work by Rosenstein-Rodan
(1943) and later by Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1989), Easterly (2006)
defines a Big Push as the "simultaneous increase in investment in many
different sectors, as well as a package of complementary policy changes
and technical interventions", coupled with "a national plan and
administrative apparatus to direct the investments, technical
interventions, and policy changes."

[The long-term challenge of diversifying]{.underline} the Saudi economy,
however, means that the Big Push [will]{.underline} inevitably evolve
into a "Long Push", **[extend]{.underline}**ing well **[beyond
2030]{.underline}**. Successful diversification strategies involve
generational policy and capital commitments due to the gradual
cultivation of comparative advantages. In two recent papers, Alsweilem,
Cader and Rietveld (2023a and 2023b) apply the lens of Economic Fitness
to the challenge of designing diversification strategies, industrial
policy and SWF/SDF investment programs. This approach captures the
diversity of an economy's productive capabilities and its ability to
produce complex products. Productive capabilities, mapped using
disaggregated export data, are determined by the level of human and
physical capital, intellectual property, quality of institutions,
infrastructure, skills and technical know-how. Particularly when
starting from initial conditions of a narrow industrial base, relatively
expensive input costs and high oil dependence, the pursuit of
diversification through increased economic fitness is a deeply
strategic, long-term undertaking.

[[The Saudi advantage is an ability to **harness**]{.mark} large [**oil
revenues** for]{.mark} **sustained [public
investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The inevitable extension of the
ambitious timeline of [Vision 2030 will]{.underline} therefore
[be]{.underline} a [positive]{.underline} development, [but]{.underline}
one that **[requires]{.underline}** economic resilience across and
beyond the **[oil-revenue]{.underline}** cycle. [The **current level**
of [public investment can be **accommodated** by]{.mark} oil [revenues
associated with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
US**[\$[75]{.mark}]{.underline}**-85 per barrel oil-price range [that
has prevailed]{.underline} since the second half of 2022, coupled with
limited use of debt financing started from a low level of overall
indebtedness.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

At the same time, under the current policy mix, the prevailing
oil-revenue levels will not accommodate rebuilding of foreign-asset
pools that were significantly drawn upon following the post-2014 shock.
Indeed, the increase in public and PIF investment since 2022 has been
accompanied by an increase in new external-debt issuance, rather than
the accumulation of net foreign assets (see Figure 1). Concurrently, the
PIF has outlined the need to increase new capital deployments to around
US\$70bn per year from the current range of US\$40bn to US\$50bn to
continue meeting its Vision 2030 targets.1

Resilience across the oil-revenue cycle requires rebuilding and growing
a foreign-asset portfolio that will diversify Saudi Arabia's wealth and
income sources. [Access to stable]{.underline} and sustainable streams
of [foreign income is]{.underline} of **[critical]{.underline}**
importance [to the resilience of the **Saudi econ**]{.underline}omy, as
this foreign income finances the import of most consumer goods, from
cars to food, medical supplies, clothing, technological and household
appliances, and essential services. Moreover, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the context of **[[Vision]{.underline}]{.mark}** 2030, [[**foreign
income** is **needed to pay** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[importing]{.underline} of most **[[intermediate
goods]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**
goods, **[[machinery]{.underline}]{.mark}**, raw materials, chemicals,
[[and **services**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[associated
with]{.underline}** large-scale [infrastructure]{.underline} and
megaproject investments. Finally, preserving external balance in the
context of rising imports is critical to macroeconomic stability and
resilience, given the fixed exchange rate between the Saudi Riyal and US
dollar.

Historically, [[oil]{.mark} exports [have been the]{.mark}
**near-[exclusive]{.mark}** [source of]{.mark} **fiscal revenue**
and]{.underline} hard-**[currency [earnings]{.mark}]{.underline}**
through which to pay for imports and manage the fixed exchange rate.
Thus, income from the foreign assets can play a critical role in
supplementing oil revenue in funding the sustained domestic-investment
push (the Long Push) set in motion by Vision 2030. Below, we consider
policy options that will promote the build-up of income-generating
foreign assets, but first it is instructive to summarize the most
salient fiscal reforms that have occurred in Saudi Arabia over the past
decade.

II\. Petrodollars to Petroriyals:

The PIF's Innovative Diversification Mandate

The collapse in oil prices in the second half of 2014 resulted in
several important policy reforms in Saudi Arabia. The most profound
shift was around the balance between foreign and domestic asset
accumulation. Since that time, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) has
become the primary instrument through which oil revenues are
intermediated towards large-scale public investments associated with
Vision 2030. This represents a historic break with the so-called
petrodollar recycling model, which has been a prominent feature of the
macroeconomic management of Gulf states since the 1970s.

According to the petrodollar recycling model (Caballero, Farhi and
Gourinchas, 2008), oil-price spikes historically boosted oil exporters'
incomes by more than the demand for spending and domestic investment,
leading to higher savings and current-account surpluses. Historically,
these surpluses were largely "recycled" into dollar and other
reserve-currency assets (and, after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008,
into increasingly diversified foreign assets through rapidly growing
SWFs) -- hence the term "petrodollar recycling".

In recent years, the petrodollar-recycling pattern has already been
fundamentally upended -- not just in Saudi Arabia, but across the Gulf
states. Surplus assets that were historically mainly accumulated through
foreign-exchange reserves held by the Saudi Arabian central bank, have
declined since 2014. There are many reasons for this shift, including
demographic trends, higher per capita domestic spending needs leading to
smaller fiscal surpluses for a given oil price, and a growing appetite
for less-liquid and higher-risk assets. But the most significant factor
has been the PIF's Big Push into domestic investments, which is now
evolving into an innovative model for institutional investment:
achieving high performance through economic diversification. The net
effect has been the relative shift away from the accumulation of foreign
assets in favor of long-term investments in local currency, with the PIF
taking center stage in the Big Push for the diversification and
modernization of the Saudi economy. In effect, surpluses are
increasingly held in the form of "petroriyals", rather than
petrodollars.

If this proves to be a permanent structural break it will have profound
implications for Saudi Arabia's macroeconomic and fiscal policy. The
Kingdom's ability to draw on foreign-exchange reserves to stabilize
public spending and investment, while managing the fixed exchange rate
in the event of a negative oil-revenue shock has already declined, given
the reduction from US\$750bn before the 2014 shock to the current level
of US\$450bn (according to official data from SAMA); while imports,
government spending and the PIF's capital deployments have increased
considerably.

While this domestic focus has already delivered impressive results and
brought about a much-needed focus on long-term investment over
short-term consumption, we argue that foreign assets and income remain
vital to Saudi Arabia, not least due to large-scale infrastructure and
megaproject investments which require significant intermediate capital
goods and services from abroad. While there is increased appetite for
resorting to debt financing, non-oil revenues and privatization
proceeds, [it is inevitable that **non-oil revenue sources** and
**debt-service costs** will be correlated with oil revenues. The cost of
adjustment through these channels will]{.underline}, therefore, [also
**rise** during a **negative oil-revenue shock**]{.underline}. The
primary risk stemming from the post-2014 emphasis on domestic investment
over foreign-asset accumulation, therefore, is that it could make Saudi
Arabia more dependent on oil revenue for fiscal and external stability.

As we explain in greater detail below, an [important long-term objective
should be to continue **[diversifying]{.mark}**]{.underline} sources of
**[public revenue]{.underline}**, so that it is balanced across oil,
mining, sales taxes, tourism, debt financing, and -- as we argue for in
this paper -- financial income on both domestic and foreign assets. This
portfolio of revenue sources will feature a mix of uncorrelated revenue
streams and combine local- and foreign-currency income. As the Big Push
evolves into the Long Push, [this [will **enable**
Saudi]{.mark}]{.underline} Arabia [[to]{.mark} **sustain spending** and
investment]{.underline} across the oil-revenue cycle --
[and]{.underline} help [[prepare for a]{.underline}]{.mark}n eventual
**[[post-oil future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

III\. Progress on Reducing Oil Dependence:

Revenue Diversification, but Rising Break-Evens

Historically, even when oil prices have fallen sharply (as in 2009 and
2014), oil's share of total revenue in Saudi Arabia has remained above
85%, given the lack of non-oil tax revenue -- and, hence, such shocks
had to be met with sharp, procyclical cuts in public spending and
investment. The landmark introduction of a VAT sales tax in the
aftermath of the 2014 oil shock, however, initiated a structural shift
that resulted in non-oil revenues growing steadily ever since. Saudi
Arabia also engaged in successful debt issuances, including foreign
borrowing in the aftermath of the 2014 oil price shock.

These developments mean that Saudi Arabia's portfolio of revenue sources
is now more diversified than before the 2014 shock (see Figure 2). This
[diversification is **evident** both in the total size of **non-oil
revenues annually** and the fact that oil's share of total revenue has
remained **below 70%**,]{.underline} even during the large windfall in
2022.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

A common rule of thumb for assessing fiscal dependence on oil is to
estimate the average price per barrel required to balance the budget for
assumed levels of spending and oil production. Such fiscal "break-even
price" estimates either assume real spending, non-oil revenues, and
production volumes to be constant or following a steady growth path. In
the Saudi case, production volumes are well anchored given its
leadership role in OPEC, which means output typically fluctuates in a
range of 9 million to 11 million barrels a day (on rare occasions
widening to 8 million to 12 million barrels per day). Further, non-oil
revenues can be assumed to increase steadily, while spending growth can
be linked to medium-term expenditure commitments.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

As shown in Figure 3, Saudi Arabia's break-even oil price decreased
after the 2014 oil-revenue shock due to the growth of non-oil revenues
and a sharp reduction in spending. While most regional estimates put the
Kingdom's break-even oil price slightly above those of its peers, such
as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the decline in the
break-even price after 2014 reflects significant progress, particularly
considering the resumption of spending growth since 2019. Figure 3
should, however, be caveated: a meaningful reduction in oil dependence
will break the historical tendency of break-evens to correlate with oil
revenues over the cycle.

While it will take a few more years to get a better understanding of
more recent fiscal dynamics in Saudi Arabia, it appears that the fiscal
break-even oil price has again risen in response to increased oil
revenues in 2022 and 2023. The most recent estimates by the IMF, for
example, released in the fourth quarter of 2023, suggested that the most
recent break-even oil price for Saudi Arabia is once again US\$86 per
barrel. Further, estimates of the break-even oil price that attempt to
account for investment and expenditure through the PIF are higher than
those focused exclusively on the budget. The increase in break-even oil
prices in recent years suggests that the procyclical relationship
between spending, investment and oil prices remains a concern.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Oil dependence is also evident with respect to Saudi Arabia's external
balances. A short-hand proxy for the oil-price sensitivity of the Saudi
current-account balance is to estimate an "external break-even" price
for oil. This is akin to the fiscal break-even oil price, but rather
than estimating the oil price required to balance the budget, the focus
is rather on the oil price needed to generate sufficient export revenues
to pay for imports. Figure 4 shows Brad Setser's estimates for Saudi
external break-even oil prices (see Setser and Frank, 2017 for
methodology). Note that the recent increase in the external break-even
price for oil is in line with fiscal break-evens. Recent IMF estimates
of Saudi Arabia's external break-even oil price also show an increase
from around US\$50 per barrel in 2020 to over US\$90 per barrel for
2024. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, relative to both total exports and
the total non-oil GDP, non-oil exports have remained relatively flat
since 2010. These data indicate that Saudi Arabia remains dependent on
oil revenues for external financing.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Finally, oil dependence also manifests through cyclical correlation
between oil and various economic indicators. Procyclicality is evident
in the historical correlation between capital expenditure and oil
revenues, shown in Figure 6. This correlation suggests that the burden
of fiscal adjustment has historically fallen on the capital-spending
component of the budget. Given the central role of the PIF in capital
projects and infrastructure investments, a key objective is ensuring
these can be sustained in the event of lower oil revenues, breaking the
historic tendency to freeze capital projects when oil revenues decline.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

[A **stop-start pattern** in public investment is **problematic** from a
diversification perspective and **presents a** potential **challenge**
to the **Vision 2030** agenda, should oil revenues
**decline**]{.underline}. Commodity-dependent, [high-cost economies need
**patient capital** in which investment is **sustained** beyond the
medium term]{.underline}. The relative absence of obvious "low-hanging
fruit" in the effort for diversification of the Saudi economy requires a
Long Push, rather than a Big Push -- thereby putting a premium on
institutions and policies that can promote countercyclical resilience
and sustainability.

Overall, the 2014 oil-revenue shock and its aftermath initiated
important fiscal reforms, notably the growth of non-oil revenues and
successful debt issuances. That said, the recent increase in fiscal and
external break-even price of oil, in correlation with higher oil prices
and revenues, suggests that the procyclical tendencies remain.
[Macroeconomic [**stability** and]{.mark} **fiscal
[resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}, therefore, [[persist as]{.mark}
notable [risks in the event of]{.mark}]{.underline} sharp or
[**[protracted decline]{.mark}** in oil revenues]{.underline}. In the
remainder of this paper, we consider policies that will enhance
sustainability, stability and resilience -- which are critical to the
transition from the Big Push to the Long Push.

Box 1: Cross-Border Co-Investment, Leapfrogging Innovation and
Attracting FDI

Some commodity-dependent economies use their SWFs and SDFs to pursue and
accelerate long-term opportunities that can unlock significant gains in
productivity, innovation, and technology adoption. First, SWFs are
uniquely positioned to provide the patient, long-term capital that is
required to innovate from a low initial level. Second, and more
importantly, strategic cross-border SWF investments can target the
transfer of knowledge, technology and "know how", where those productive
capabilities are missing in the local market, thereby shortening the
horizon over which high-complexity economic activities become feasible.

Strategic SWFs and SDFs can be effective tools for stimulating local
economies and markets, while delivering strong investment returns
(Sharma, 2017). Indeed, when these funds are structured correctly, there
is considerable evidence that robust investment performance and national
development priorities can align.

Casady, Monk and Sharma (2024) show that, as of March 31, 2022,
Singapore\'s Temasek achieved a 40-year "total shareholder return" of
16% while catalyzing numerous domestic industries. Similarly, the
Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign investor based in Abu Dhabi,
holds a five-year rolling rate of return of 12.2% since 2017. Moreover,
the Sixth Swedish National Pension Fund (AP6) posted a five-year average
return of 16.8% and a ten-year average return of 13%. Clark and Monk
(2015) argue that SDFs typically pursue a combination of four
development objectives alongside commercial returns:

Reinforcing: SDFs that own existing but underperforming national
assets---such as companies, infrastructure, or other real assets---are
responsible for reorganizing, professionalizing, and innovating state
holdings to drive commercialization and enhance returns.

Crowding-In: SDFs that invest in emerging domestic industries can
achieve greater financial and developmental returns when they attract
capital commitments from both private and public investors from other
nations. For instance, if an SDF demonstrates credible commercial
acumen, it can syndicate local deals with investors who might otherwise
invest elsewhere.

Catalytic: SDFs not tied to specific industries or national assets can
catalyze new industries, thereby diversifying the economy away from
sectors that are no longer profitable or sustainable in the long term.
These SDFs also address gaps in the economy by investing in solutions
that will undoubtedly be required within the next decade.

Financialization: Leveraging their capabilities and resources, SDFs can
enhance the financial infrastructure of the local economy, thereby
supporting the development process through the expansion of the capital
market and the emergence of new financial intermediaries and investors
focused on regional opportunities.

In the case of Saudi Arabia, the PIF is pursuing all four
diversification priorities simultaneously. This is an ambitious agenda,
which will require significant resources. Fortunately, the Saudi economy
is already large, with a GDP of more than US\$1.2 trillion. The Vision
2030 will see this large economy transformed and transitioned away from
fossil-fuel dependence and towards a net-zero footprint. The environment
established in Saudi Arabia through Vision 2030 is ideally suited to
this model of cross-border co-investment, led by the PIF. The strategic
use of the PIF's balance sheet to co-invest with sector-specific global
corporate leaders can promote leapfrogging -- essentially, "importing"
technologies to skip intermediate steps on the productivity-growth
ladder -- thus expediting the expansion of Saudi productive
capabilities.

Moreover, we believe that the co-investment model will also create
opportunities for "crowding-in" private Saudi capital -- and triangulate
between the PIF, global firms and the domestic private sector and
investor base. The establishment of local investment opportunities in
partnership with global corporations will also promote the deepening of
the Kingdom's capital markets and provide investment vehicles and
destinations for attracting FDI, creating an opportunity to reduce
corporate tax rates to a globally competitive level of 15%.

Reduced investment taxes would be productive at this point of
development, given the need to attract FDI, as it will enhance
foreign-investor appetite in Saudi Arabia. Higher taxation may be
considered once a critical level of investment has been attracted and
the Saudi tax system has evolved to the point where a comprehensive
package of investment and tax incentives can be offered to long-term
investors.

IV\. Increasing Resilience:

The Role of Foreign Assets and Investment Income

[[While **2024 oil prices**]{.mark} are currently within a range that
**[allow]{.mark}**s Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [to break even on
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} broadly [**[expansionary fiscal path]{.mark}**
and **cover**]{.underline} its **[import]{.underline}**
cost**[s]{.underline}**, the [[reform **momentum**]{.underline}]{.mark}
that was initiated by the 2014 collapse in oil prices [[would be
**tested** in]{.mark} the event of [a]{.mark}]{.underline} similar
[[**decline** in oil revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}. Generating
hard-currency financial income is a critical function of many SWFs, with
offshore allocations accounting for all or most assets of the Norwegian,
Abu Dhabi, Kuwaiti, Qatari and Chilean funds (in addition to several
non-commodity SWFs, such as those from New Zealand, Australia, China and
Singapore). In this section, we outline the conceptual case for
accumulating foreign assets, particularly in resource-dependent
economies, before considering how such a policy could be designed and
implemented in Saudi Arabia.

**Global oil demand is [high now]{.underline} and [will
increase]{.underline}\-\--all other projections are
[unrealistic]{.underline}. Failure to invest would be
[catastrophic]{.underline}.**

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/markets/oil/2024/08/26/exxon-sees-net-zero-missed-with-2050-oil-demand-as-high-as-today/

(Bloomberg) \-- Exxon Mobil Corp. forecasts [**[global oil
demand]{.mark}** in **2050** [will be]{.mark} the same --- or
even]{.underline} slightly **[[high]{.mark}er]{.underline}** --- [than
current levels, putting efforts to reach net zero carbon
emissions]{.underline} by mid-century **[well out of
reach]{.underline}**.

[Oil demand will remain **[above 100 million barrels a day]{.mark}**
through 2050, driven by growth in industrial uses]{.underline} such as
plastic production and heavy-duty transportation, Exxon said Monday in
its annual Global Outlook. The **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[E]{.underline}**nergy **[A]{.underline}**gency's [Net Zero Emissions
Scenario says demand must drop **75%** to 24 million barrels a day by
2050 to limit warming to 1.5C]{.underline} (2.7F) above pre-industrial
norms, as called for in the Paris climate agreement.

"[The IEA says, as do we, that **the world is not on that
pathway**]{.underline}," said Chris Birdsall, Exxon's director of
economics and energy, in an interview. "We have to be crystal clear on
the path the world is on. Otherwise, we delude ourselves."

Exxon does predict that global greenhouse gas emissions will begin to
drop by 2030, as renewable energy sources continue to grow, and will
fall 25% by 2050. That's likely not enough to prevent significant
climate change.

[Many countries and corporations]{.underline}, including Exxon, [have
drawn up [plans to reach net zero]{.mark}]{.underline} emissions [by
2050]{.underline}. But [achieving those goals is [becoming
**harder**]{.mark}]{.underline} every year, [[as **demand** for
**energy**]{.mark} of all kinds **[continues to
rise]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Exxon's forecasts are roughly in line with other recent projections by
oil industry participants. OPEC sees 116 million barrels a day of
consumption in 2045, while pipeline giant Enbridge Inc. predicts demand
could top 110 million barrels a day.

[Demand will be high enough that **[failing to invest now]{.mark}** in
new fossil fuel projects [would be
"**catastrophic**]{.mark},"]{.underline} Birdsall said. [Without new
investment, Exxon sees oil supply falling **70%**]{.underline} to 30
million barrels a day by 2030, [sending crude prices soaring and
decimating the global economy]{.underline}.

Exxon's forecast is likely to anger environmentalists and politicians
who accuse the oil industry of using pessimistic narratives to paralyze
climate action and protect profits. But Birdsall said the Global Outlook
is a "realistic" projection based on real-world data and forecasts.

"[We]{.underline} feel like we [have to come out **strong** with that
message]{.underline}, because there are activists that are pushing [a
[keep-it-in-the-ground approach]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "We can
point to places where that's [starting to **leak into policy**. That's
really **[dangerous]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

[[Countries may be moving toward green energy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
away from fossil fuels, but [[Big Oil is **hardly** all
in]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On Friday, two impact-oriented funds dropped a climate proposal intended
to go to a ExxonMobil (XOM) shareholder vote after the Houston-based oil
giant filed a lawsuit to remove the measure from its proxy ballot.

In the complaint, the oil producer said the activist investors Arjuna
Capital and Follow This were driven by an \"extreme agenda\" with the
goal of \"diminishing the company\'s existing business.\"

"Given Exxon\'s preference to fight a battle in court rather than allow
shareholders the freedom of a vote at its annual meeting, we decided to
withdraw the climate proposal,\" Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This,
said in a statement on Friday.

As [**[ESG]{.mark} initiatives** and **investing**]{.underline} styles
[[fall **out of favor**]{.mark}, energy [giants are **doubling
down**]{.mark} on]{.underline} their core business of [oil]{.underline}.
Last year, ExxonMobil announced a near \$60 billion deal to acquire
Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) that will make it the largest player in
US shale.

More than a week later, Chevron (CVX) said it would buy oil explorer and
producer Hess (HES) in an all-stock agreement valued at \$53 billion.

[[Big Oil]{.underline}]{.mark} companies have [[posted **blockbuster
quarters**]{.underline}]{.mark} following the start of the
Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 as crude prices surged.

Even as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell more than 10% in 2023, US
energy giants saw their second-largest annual profit in a decade. [[The
industry is under pressure from shareholders to **keep momentum
going**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Last week, an activist hedge fund sent a letter to BP (BP) demanding
that the British oil and gas producer scale back its \"irrational\"
green energy strategy, which has, \"quite understandably, depressed the
value of BP's share price.\"

A BP spokesman said in a statement the company continues \"to receive
support for our strategy\" from other shareholders.

\'The problem is not oil and gas\'

Oil and gas participants say [a shift to green energy won\'t happen from
one day to the next, and fossil fuels are]{.underline} still [**needed**
for]{.underline} the [transition]{.underline} to happen.

\"[We cannot replace overnight an energy system that took 150 years to
build]{.underline},\" said ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco in
November.

\"The problem is not oil and gas. It's emissions,\" he added. \"The
solutions to climate change have been too focused on reducing supply.
That's a recipe for human hardship and a poorer world.\"

Last year the International Energy Agency, which advocates for green
technologies, noted the oil and gas industry invested around \$20
billion in clean energy in 2022, some 2.5% of its total capital
spending.

The relative disproportionate spending isn\'t due to a lack of efforts
from green advocates.

In 2021, environmentally friendly fund Engine No. 1 obtained three
independent director seats on ExxonMobil\'s board via a proxy battle.

Mark Kramer, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business who wrote a case
study on Engine No. 1 and ExxonMobil, said even with the seat wins, he
believes [little progress was made]{.underline}.

\"It\'s quite clear --- [its not working,\" he said of green advocates\'
efforts. \"The [profitability of oil]{.mark}]{.underline} and gas right
now [is **[so]{.mark} [strong]{.mark}** that it's extremely **har**d for
a company to walk away from that]{.underline}, or even to talk \[of\]
walking away from it.\"

That\'s not to say Big Oil hasn\'t made pledges for net zero emissions
and launched large initiatives in the energy transition. Following
Engine No. 1\'s proxy battle, ExxonMobil announced a Low Carbon
Solutions unit.

The company has since committed more than \$20 billion through 2027 for
initiatives such as carbon capture, hydrogen production, and a massive
lithium extraction operation announced last year. The critical metal is
used to make EV batteries.

\"We see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric
vehicles per year by 2030. With economically advantaged production, it
has a much smaller environmental impact than today\'s supply.\" Woods
said during the company\'s earnings call on Friday.

\'No good answer\'

HBS\'s Kramer says ExxonMobil is receiving pressure from shareholders on
either side of the green issue.

\"There is no good answer if you\'re an ExxonMobil. You have activist
shareholders on both sides,\" he said.

\"You have ones saying, \'I want as much profit now as soon as possible,
and I don\'t care about the future or believe in climate change.\' And
you have \[others\] that say, \'If there\'s no planet, and it\'s not
habitable, there\'s no point in having dividends,\'\" he added.

\"I think the greater pressure comes from the shareholders who want
profits now,\" he added.

The problem for oil companies is [**[renewable projects]{.mark}** that
exceed return on investment hurdles \"[have been **hard to
find**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" says Stewart Glickman, energy equity
analyst at CFRA Research. That could have implications for what
consumers pay.

\"I would argue that federal governments have both a role and a
responsibility to change incentives, so that individual firms change
their behavior. That, too, has its own tradeoffs,\" said the analyst.
\"Being tougher on oil and gas firms to move away from hydrocarbons will
make energy more expensive, and that makes voters unhappy.\"

\"It would be better if governments could have honest conversations with
the public about this trade-off,\" he added.

HBS\'s Kramer agrees the answer must be government intervention.

\"[[**Unless** government]{.underline}]{.mark} steps \[in\] and requires
a phase-out of fossil fuel or [[imposes]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} heavy [**[carbon tax]{.mark}** that it's no
longer economically desirable, I don't think the change is going to
happen]{.underline},\" he said.

**[AT: "Energy Transition Inevitable"]{.underline}**

**Oil demand is rising despite so called progress towards the energy
transition**

**Slav 24**---Irinia Slav (write with over a decade of experience on the
oil and gas industry). "Oil and Gas Are Here To Stay" Oil Price. July
14, 2024, accessed August 23, 2024.

ADA-340

[The energy transition is showing signs of **losing
momentum**]{.underline} over the past few months. [**EV sales are
slowing**, wind and solar]{.underline} capacity [additions]{.underline}
[are **not expanding**]{.underline} fast enough, [and electricity is
getting **more**]{.underline} instead of less
**[expensive]{.underline}**.

With those signs, others have been flashing red, too. Despite the push
against oil and gas, these are here to stay for the long haul---and
demand won't even decline that much after peaking, according to the
latest energy outlook of BP.

The supermajor, which used to compile the Statistical Review of World
Energy, now does its own review. And according to its latest edition,
[oil demand will **peak** next year]{.underline}. And it's not the first
time it's called the peak for oil demand.

The [last time its]{.underline} statistical [review]{.underline} said
that [demand growth had peaked]{.underline}---in 2019---it [turned
out]{.underline} to be [very wrong]{.underline}. In reality, [oil demand
soared after the end of the pandemic lockdowns]{.underline} to reach new
all-time highs.

Now, [BP has noted]{.underline} that over the past five years, [oil
demand has been growing]{.underline} at an average of [**half a million
barrels** daily since **2019**]{.underline}, but that is about to end,
with demand on the decline over the next couple of decades. But here's
the thing. Before, BP forecast that this decline would be quite
substantial. Now, it expects that in 2035, the world will still consume
97.8 million barrels of oil per day in 2035, which would be a relatively
minor decline from the current rate of consumption, which is about 100
million barrels daily, which may rise above that this year if demand
strengthens in the second half.

In other words, [BP acknowledges]{.underline} [that]{.underline} the
human civilization's [dependence]{.underline} on hydrocarbons [will not
be so easy to shake]{.underline} [simply by embracing alternative energy
sources]{.underline}. What's more, primary energy demand is still on an
upward trajectory, and hydrocarbons will be the energy sources to
respond to much of that---until we start needing less energy.

[It is **energy demand** that is **key** to]{.underline} the
[**success** of the **transition**]{.underline} to energy sources that
leave a lot to be desired in areas such as energy density and storage
costs. To make them work, [we need to consume less rather than more
energy]{.underline}. Indeed, if governments and the business world
suddenly find all the money and regulatory support that the transition
needs, energy demand growth will peak by next year under BP's Net Zero
scenario.

Unlike that perfect-case scenario, [the Current Trajectory scenario
points to energy demand growth continuing]{.underline}
[until]{.underline} [the]{.underline} middle of the [next
decade]{.underline} before peaking and then plateauing---because the
developing world would continue to need more energy.

The BP outlook essentially outlines a deepening divide between the
developed world, which is where the transition push began and where it
has been the strongest, and the developing world, where access to energy
is still a luxury in many places. Yet as developing economies grow, this
luxury would become accessible to more people, and these people would be
consuming ever more energy until they hit a peak.

The fact that [the developing world is driving the increase in oil and
gas demand while the developed world has seen a minor
decline]{.underline} in its own demand for these---at the significant
expense of deindustrialization---[highlights a contradiction
in]{.underline} one of the most popular [transition
arguments]{.underline}. It states that the transition will ensure
abundant and affordable energy for everyone. However, the current state
of the world is proof enough this is wishful thinking at best: the facts
suggest that energy abundance lies with the energy sources the
transition wants to do away with and replace.

That is how the developing world increases overall global oil demand
while the developed world tries to consume less of it and mostly fails.
And that is why BP has forecast continued dominance for oil---and
gas---over the long term, with the decline mostly the result of
improving energy efficiency, per its outlook. Interestingly, under its
Current Trajectory scenario, [strong oil demand remains despite a
twofold increase in wind and solar deployments]{.underline} by 2050, to
give those two, along with geothermal and biogas, a share of about 25%
in total primary energy by that year.

This suggests that [the **current trajectory** of energy
policies]{.underline}, [which has seen]{.underline} a veritable
**[surge]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} wind and solar deployments, EV
sales, and all sorts of other [transition-related
activities]{.underline}, [is falling]{.underline} hopelessly
**[behind]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} targets of the [net-zero
plan]{.underline}. It is something many transition advocates have been
warning about, the IEA being among the most vocal ones. If the
transition to net zero is to happen, the world needs to move faster,
harder, and with even more urgency.

Yet this is not how things are moving on. There is that gap between the
wealthy developed world, which is getting less wealthy as it directs
ever-growing cash flows to the transition, and the poor developing
world, which is getting wealthier because it is consuming more and more
hydrocarbon energy---and it likes it. That's how oil and gas will
continue to dominate the global energy landscape in the future. The
developing world is a big place.

**[AT: IEA]{.underline}**

**[FIRST]{.underline}, the 2024 IEA estimate is [factually
incorrect]{.underline} and [ignores]{.underline} growing demand
abroad.**

Haitham **Al Ghais 24**, OPEC Secretary General, 6-13-2024, "OPEC Sec
Gen: Peak oil demand not on the horizon," EA Forum,
https://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/general/OPEC-SG-peak-oil-demand-not-on-the-horizon.pdf

In the 1990s and 2000s, [the world]{.underline} regularly [saw column
inches devoted to the theory of [peak oil supply]{.mark}]{.underline},
amplified by voices like Colin Campbell and Matthew Simmons. Decades
later, however, [it [has]{.mark} still [**not** come to
pass]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [enhanced economics and constant
[improvement]{.mark}]{.underline} [in tech]{.underline}nology [have
[helped **lower costs**]{.mark} and open up new frontiers to **expand**
the resource base]{.underline}.

The past decade or so has witnessed a shift to talk of peak oil demand,
with some forecasters increasingly pushing theoretical scenarios that
have decided before any data is analyzed that oil should not be part of
a sustainable energy future.

This is evident [in some net zero scenarios, with suggestions that oil
demand will **peak before 2030**, or]{.underline} more dramatically,
[that oil demand will **drop** by more than 25% by 2030]{.underline},
and [with calls to **stop investing** in]{.underline} new
[oil]{.underline} projects.

[This narrative was repeated]{.underline} only yesterday [when [the
**IEA**]{.mark} published its Oil 2024 report in which it once again
stated that oil demand would peak]{.underline} before 2030. [It is a
**dangerous commentary**]{.underline}, especially [for
consumers]{.underline}, and will only lead to energy volatility on a
potentially unprecedented scale.

[We have]{.underline} also [heard similar]{.underline} types of
[narrative before. Ones that have [**proven** to be
**wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IEA suggested that gasoline demand
had peaked in 2019, but gasoline consumption hit record levels in 2023,
and indeed continues to rise this year. It also stated that coal demand
had peaked in 2014, but today coal consumption continues to hit record
levels.

Many net zero futures focus almost exclusively on replacing
hydrocarbons, which make up more than 80% of the global energy mix
today. Rather than adding new energy sources to the mix, the focus is on
substituting energy sources, which flies in the face of the history of
supplying energy to the world. The emphasis is on rhetoric over reality;
constraint over consumer choice.

Today, wind and solar supply around 4% of global energy, with electric
vehicles (EVs) having a total global penetration rate of between 2% and
3%, even though the world has invested over \$9.5 trillion in
'transitioning' over the past two decades. OPEC welcomes all the
[[progress]{.mark} made in [renewables]{.mark} and EVs]{.underline}, but
it [is **[nowhere near]{.mark}** close [enough]{.mark} to replace
**80%** of the energy mix]{.underline}. Furthermore, [electricity grids,
battery manufacturing capacity and access to critical minerals remain
major **challenges**.]{.underline}

We should also remember that the development of renewables and EVs
require some oil-related products. Their future expansion will add to
oil demand.

Of course, we all want to lower emissions, but at the same time, we all
need ample, reliable and affordable supplies of energy. The two cannot
be decoupled. Instead, [our energy futures must focus on the full
picture and not on a **partial**, **incomplete** one]{.underline}. In
this respect, three key facts are worth bearing in mind.

[Firstly, [future energy and **oil demand growth**]{.mark} primarily
[lies within the]{.mark} non-OECD **[developing
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, driven by increasing populations, an
expanding middle class and growing economies. From now until 2045,
non-OECD oil demand is set to expand by over 25 million barrels a day
(mb/d), with China and India contributing over 10 mb/d alone.

We should also remember that [billions of people]{.underline} in the
developing world [still lack access to modern energy
services]{.underline}. For these people, their energy future is not
about net zero, deciding on the purchase of an electric vehicle, or
ruminating over the costs and benefits of energy sources. Instead, it is
about achieving the energy basics that the developed world takes for
granted, such as being able to turn on a light, cook on a clean stove or
have motorized transport to move to and from work or school.

Secondly, [[**oil demand** continues to
**increase**]{.underline}.]{.mark} At OPEC, [we see oil demand growth of
4 mb/d over]{.underline} the two years of [2024 and 2025]{.underline},
with other forecasters also seeing an expansion of over 3 mb/d. [[**Even
the IEA** sees growth]{.underline}]{.mark} of 2 mb/d [over this
period]{.underline}, followed by growth of 0.8 mb/d in 2026. [It then
**dramatically** drops off a cliff to almost no growth in the next four
years through 2030.]{.underline}

[This is]{.underline} an **[unrealistic]{.underline}** scenario, one
that would negatively impact economies across the world. [It
is]{.underline} simply [a **continuation** of the IEA's **anti-oil
narrative**. Given]{.underline} the [real trends]{.underline} we see
today, [we **do not see peak oil demand** by the end of the
decade]{.underline}.

Thirdly, [many parts of [the world]{.mark} are [witnessing a **consumer
pushback**]{.mark} as populations comprehend the implications
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} ambitious and [[**unrealistic** net zero
**policy**]{.mark} **agendas**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[is prompting]{.mark}
policymakers to **reevaluate**]{.underline} their [**approaches** to
future energy pathways, for example,]{.underline} in [the UK, with the
government recently supporting **[new oil]{.mark}**]{.underline} and gas
**[[licenses]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[These [shifts]{.mark}]{.underline}, alongside developments in the
economic landscape, [[have seen OPEC **revise**]{.mark} its oil demand
expectations **[upwards]{.mark}**]{.underline} to 116 mb/d by 2045, and
[there is potential for this]{.underline} level [to be **even higher**.
We do not foresee a peak in oil demand in our long-term
forecast.]{.underline}

On the supply side, [tech]{.underline}nological [improvements are
allowing us to]{.underline} continually [add resources]{.underline} to
the base [to help **meet demand growth**. There are clearly enough
resources for this century and beyond]{.underline}, with the world's
proven crude oil reserves standing at over 1.55 trillion barrels.
Moreover, [tech]{.underline}nologies are also [enabling us to take
**huge strides**]{.underline} in reducing emissions, as exemplified by
the availability of cleaner fuels, much improved efficiencies and
technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, carbon
dioxide removal and direct air capture.

[Everyone is free to have an opinion, but it is important that this is
**based** on]{.underline} the **[realities]{.underline}** we see before
us today. The clear need to prioritize energy security, utilize all
available energies, deliver energy affordability, enhance
sustainability, reduce emissions and not limit our energy options in the
face of expanding demand. Oil can deliver on all those fronts, and as we
look to the future it is the very versatility of oil that ensures that
we do not see peak oil demand on the horizon. Just as peak oil supply
has never transpired, predictions of peak oil demand are following a
similar trend.

Against this backdrop, [stakeholders need to]{.underline} recognize the
need for continued oil industry [invest]{.underline}ment, today,
tomorrow, and many decades into the future given the products derived
from crude oil are essential for our daily lives[. [Those that dismiss
this]{.mark} reality are [sowi]{.mark}ng the seeds for
**[future]{.mark}** energy **[shortfalls]{.mark}** and **increased
volatility**, and open]{.underline}ing [the door to a world where the
gap between the 'energy haves' and 'energy have nots' grows even
further]{.underline}.

Second, Putin's invasion of [[Ukraine is producing **long-term**]{.mark}
negative [consequences for]{.mark} the [Russian
**economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the early months of the war,
[Russia benefited from [**higher** energy
**prices**]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven by Europe's reliance on Russian
oil and gas. [[Despite this]{.mark} **short-term** energy rush,
[however]{.mark}, the [Russia]{.mark}n economy [is
**contracting**]{.mark}. In 2022, it shrank]{.underline} somewhere
between 2.2 percent to [3.9 percent]{.underline} (according to the IMF
and OECD, respectively). [Russian exports]{.underline} and imports also
[plummeted]{.underline}, with estimates varying between 13 percent and
[21 percent]{.underline}. Inflation in Russia is soaring, reaching
almost 14 percent last year.

[Sanctions]{.underline} are already having an [impact]{.underline} that
[will **only continue** to grow **over time**]{.underline}. Recent
technology-export sanctions are exacting a heavy toll across the
economy. Industries dependent on technology imports, such as car
manufacturing, are suffering and will take years to recover. Without the
necessary materials to make new automobiles, for example, Russian car
sales dropped by 59 percent in 2022.  Sanctions have also hampered
Russia's production of smart weapons and impeded the development of
Russian telecommunications companies. Meanwhile, [[Europe]{.mark} has
successfully **[reduced]{.mark}** its [reliance on Russian
**energy**]{.mark} imports, [denying Moscow]{.mark} those [markets
**forever**]{.mark}. Thousands of foreign [companies **abandoned**
Russia, taking]{.mark} with them [their]{.mark}]{.underline} know-how
and [[**links** to the outside]{.mark} **world**. Putin said good
riddance]{.underline} to them, handing many of the properties over to
his cronies, who lack the expertise to run them efficiently. [Putin
surely must **understand** that [losing partners like
**Exxon**]{.mark}Mobil [will]{.mark} severely **[set back]{.mark}** the
[development of]{.mark} Russia's **[oil]{.mark}** industry in remote
locations [after]{.mark} he spent [**decades** trying to
**entice**]{.mark} these [companies]{.mark} to **invest** in
Russia]{.underline}. Finally, tens of thousands --- maybe hundreds of
thousands --- of Russia's best and brightest have fled Russia. These
entrepreneurs, computer programmers, financial specialists, consultants,
scientists have already boosted the GDPs of their new homes in places
such as Georgia, Armenia, and Kazakhstan.

4.1 Transition risk drivers

[[Transition]{.mark} risk drivers]{.underline} (Figure 1, box 1)
[[create]{.mark} economic **[costs]{.mark}** and financial impacts [via
changing]{.mark} relative [prices or]{.mark} market
[demand]{.mark}/supply in favor of low-carbon goods]{.underline} and
services, [either immediately or over time]{.underline}. In the latter
case, **[[expectations about future changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
[still [create **risks**]{.mark} in the present]{.underline} (van der
Ploeg & Rezai, 2020b). [Most drivers affect sunset industries
**negatively**]{.underline}, for example, [by altering relative
**prices**]{.underline} in favor of low-carbon products. By implication
they affect sunrise industries and expectations about them positively,
so could drive---at least in the medium-term---sunrise risk from
speculation, too. Key drivers are climate change mitigation policy,
technological change, and changes in consumer taste (PRA, 2015). These
are reviewed in turn as follows.

4.1.1 Climate change mitigation policies

[Policy seeking [to **internalize** the **carbon externality** is
a]{.mark} key [driver of **risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The central
plank of most [climate change mitigation strategies consists of
[**incentive-based** regulation]{.mark} that **prices carbon** either
via **taxes** or **cap-and-trade** schemes]{.underline}. The suite of
scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5°C in the recent IPCC (2018)
assessment reports a median global carbon price of \$91/tCO2 (metric ton
of CO2) in 2025 and \$179/tCO2 in 2030, with the interquartile range
reaching up to \$175/tCO2 and \$361/tCO2 respectively (calculations
based on Huppmann et al., 2018). In April 2019, only 20% of global
greenhouse gas emissions were priced at all, and less than 5% of these
were in line with Paris Agreement compatible levels (World Bank, 2019).
Effective mitigation policies could therefore drastically increase
industry and consumer prices for high-carbon products in the near
future. Regulation may also directly limit the sale of high-carbon
products. Ten countries have recently set specific times for bans on new
internal combustion engine cars, some as soon as 2030 (Meckling & Nahm,
2019).

In addition, [public **subsidies**, **regulations**, and
**investments**]{.underline} help lower [prices of low-carbon
products]{.underline}. Comprehensive policy approaches for "green
growth" such as China\'s 13th Five-Year Plan (National Development and
Reform Commission, 2016) or Europe\'s Green Deal (European Commission,
2019), include mandating, subsidizing, or directly carrying out
investments into low-carbon products and installing enabling
infrastructure. [This [make]{.mark}s [low-carbon]{.mark} products more
[competitive]{.mark} by **creating markets**, financing, and helping
innovation proceed at pace or simply altering prices
directly]{.underline} (Block & Keller, 2011; Mazzucato & Semieniuk,
2017). Some policies such as differentiated prudential requirements,
lending quotas, or targeted refinancing lines by the central bank
regulate the financial sector directly (Campiglio et al., 2018; Volz,
2017). It is important not to confuse the policy here seeking to
accelerate the transition (mitigation policy) with policy aimed at
stabilizing the financial system, which we review in the next section.

4.1.2 Technological change

Cost-saving technological innovations, possibly incentivized by earlier
climate policies, further lower the prices of low-carbon technologies
(Kavlak, McNerney, & Trancik, 2018; Nemet, 2019). This is a nonlinear
process often approximated by s-curves of adoption (Rogers, 2003). The
cheaper a new technology becomes, the more widely it is used, and
through scale and learning effects becomes even cheaper, until it
emerges as the "new normal" (Arthur, 1989), altering the technological
paradigm (Dosi, 1982). Structural change between technologies and the
change in the ratio of relative demand can thus accelerate over time,
which has led to underestimating the rate of adoption of low-carbon
technologies (Creutzig et al., 2017). Since technology diffusion
self-reinforces and evolves endogenously, once set in train, it can
contribute substantially to price changes even without any new policy
changes. As a new socio-technical regime gradually establishes itself,
it requires decreasing amounts of external support to diffuse further
(Geels, 2002). Technological trajectories can also influence policy by
opening up policy space through newly affordable alternatives (Schmidt &
Sewerin, 2017) and closing it down through path dependencies (Fouquet,
2016). Conversely, of course, policies and the politics behind them
influence which technologies are developed and deployed (Stirling,
2014).

4.1.3 Preference change

Buyers' preferences can drive demand and prices. Preferences are
endogenous to institutions and their changes (Bowles, 1998) and as more
people use a technology, network effects may accelerate further adoption
(McShane, Bradlow, & Berger, 2012; Pettifor, Wilson, Axsen, Abrahamse, &
Anable, 2017). Through their demand-pull effect, preferences can also
affect the pace and direction of technological change, which can
interact with government procurement policies (Boon & Edler, 2018).
Moving beyond private consumption choices, preference changes can stir
political movements, putting broader pressure on policy making and
changing what is politically feasible.6 The public mobilization against
nuclear fission provides a cautionary story for other technologies
(Boudet, 2019). Therefore, changes in preferences can lead both to price
changes and quantity restrictions.

4.2 **[Transition costs]{.underline}**

Transition drivers translate into transition costs (Figure 1, box 2) via
two transmission channels (Figure 1, arrow A). [**[Price]{.mark}** and
**quantity [changes]{.mark}** lead to adjustments in all sectors,
[affect]{.mark}ing **[revenues]{.mark}** of producers]{.underline}, the
real [income]{.underline} of households via unemployment and loss of
earnings on investment, [and state tax and]{.underline} state-owned
enterprise [revenue]{.underline}. Fossil fuel price changes can be
complex (Box 1). But importantly, the [[drivers]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[operate via **expectations** about **future** revenue]{.mark}
streams, especially if policy and preference changes are **credible**
and **long-lasting**]{.underline} (Helm, Hepburn, & Mash, 2003). This is
not guaranteed, for example, some of the car bans discussed above lack
credible enforcement mechanisms (Plötz, Axsen, Funke, & Gnann, 2019),
and current Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris
agreement are subject to uncertainty concerning their implementation
(den Elzen et al., 2019; Pauw, Castro, Pickering, & Bhasin, 2019).
However, if expectations change, asset stranding can occur.7

BOX 1. The effect of a carbon price on fossil fuel prices

[[A price on carbon]{.mark} is]{.underline} likely [to have two opposite
effects on fossil fuel prices. In the short run]{.underline}, consumer
[**prices [will]{.mark} rise** as firms pass costs on to consumers,
**[lower]{.mark}ing [demand]{.mark}**[, while producers earn **less
revenue**]{.mark} per unit sold]{.underline}, a typical consequence of a
tax increase in a partial equilibrium setting. [In the long run, cheaper
low-carbon substitutes could induce an [**accelerated structural
change** away]{.mark} from fossil fuels, which [could **lower prices**
due to **lack of demand** and **oversupply**.]{.mark} If fossil fuel
producers expect demand not to recover in the long run, [they
might]{.mark}]{.underline} decide to [**[flood the market]{.mark}** in
the short-run [in a **race to the bottom**]{.mark}, to sell whatever
they can]{.underline} (Sinn, 2008).8 [[This can]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[have consequences for]{.mark} the distribution of [**stranded
assets**,]{.mark} as lower-cost producers capture what is left of the
declining market]{.underline} (Mercure et al., 2018).

**A rapid transition completely [devastates]{.underline} the value of
oil.**

4.5 Two stylized scenarios

To better illustrate our theoretical framework, we conclude this section
with two stylized scenarios using the concepts and channels presented
above. We distinguish between: (a) a smooth orderly transition; (b) a
disruptive transition. Both scenarios start from the same point.
[**[Renewable]{.mark}** electricity and heat, low-emission
**transport**]{.underline}, [energy-efficient retrofits,
and]{.underline} other [low-carbon [products **prolif**]{.mark}**erate**
[as]{.mark} relative [prices **tilt in their favor**]{.mark}, driven by
**climate policies**]{.underline}, **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[change]{.underline}**, [and changes in **preferences**]{.underline}
and behavior.

A disruptive transition scenario could ensue if an ever-larger
discrepancy arises between this direction of technological trajectory
and sunset industry investment. [Firms continue developing fossil
reserves, building pipelines, transformation plants, and internal
combustion engine factories, possibly egged on by beliefs of oil demand
rebound, that are shared by a sufficient number of financial investors.
These beliefs could]{.underline} in turn [be supported by **uneven** and
**erratic** climate **policies**, highly publicized low-carbon
technological setbacks, vested interests bound up with]{.underline} at
least [a semblance of "**business as usual**" in the high-carbon sectors
and biased information]{.underline} as prominent forecasters and
scenarios reinforce shared beliefs. [As large [investments become
**sunk** and]{.mark} **committed**, **[returns do not
materialize]{.mark}** due to **tougher** low-carbon
competition]{.underline}. Thus, [[**persistently low** fossil fuel
**prices** and **insufficient demand**]{.mark} for high carbon products
[**erode cash flows** and **destabilize**]{.mark} **large [balance
sheets]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Stock market valuations]{.underline}, still
reflecting the belief of a high-carbon future, [become vulnerable to
**sudden changes** in expectations.]{.underline}

[Disorder could then be triggered by]{.underline}, for instance, a
disruptive event affecting one of the transition drivers. This could be
a large-scale climatic event (e.g., unprecedented heat waves) that
creates a generalized sense of urgency, leading to an "inevitable policy
response" (PRI, 2020). This might take the form of [a [**rapid** and
**unanticipated** increase in the **price** on the
**carbon**]{.mark}]{.underline} content of goods or highly restrictive
regulation. [Transition [costs **jump** upwards]{.mark} and firms
re-evaluate their earnings prospect and write off assets. Banks
re-assess the performance of their fossil-related loans and write
off]{.underline} substantial shares of [their assets]{.underline} in
turn. [Equity investors]{.underline} may [react faster, anticipating the
market-woes, and jettison high-carbon firm financial
investments]{.underline}, whereby [**[market valuation
collapses]{.underline}**.]{.mark} At this point, the full chain of
events described in the previous subsections could play out.

or compensated---[[will have a **major impact** on t]{.mark}he
**political systems** of oil]{.underline} and gas [producing
states]{.underline}. According to the International Energy Agency4 ,
[those states could lose **US\$7 trillion** in revenues]{.underline} by
2040. Countries that rely on oil revenues for large shares of government
revenue5 include Libya (96%), Iraq (89%), Kuwait (70%), Nigeria 6 (65%),
Saudi Arabia7 (61%), Venezuela 8 (50%), Russia 9 (40%), UAE 10 (46%),
and Iran 11 (29%). [Declining oil revenues12 will oblige these countries
to **cut subsidies**]{.underline} (including for utilities such as
electricity and water), [**raise taxes**, and]{.underline} in many cases
[diminish their reliance on expatriate workers, forcing citizens to
take]{.underline} menial [**jobs** they are not used to
doing]{.underline}. The world's leading oil exporter, **[[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}** 13, [[is]{.mark} **particularly
[vulnerable]{.mark}**: a booming youth population and the need to create
**millions** of jobs will require deficit spending of up [to]{.mark}
US\$100 billion per year, **[eroding reserves]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that could be exhausted within just a few years.
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too, [[would lose]{.mark}
**considerable [income]{.mark}** in a decarbonized world, [which could
lead it]{.mark}s government to [become]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[**more repressive** to hold its grip on power]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The potential upside of such changes is that these states will be
compelled to reform their economies and invest in education, industry,
human capital, and other non-energy sectors, as Riyadh is seeking to do
in its Vision 203014 plan. But such [[transitions are]{.mark}
**difficult** and **[disruptive]{.mark}**, and could]{.underline} also
[be [a source of **domestic instability**]{.mark}, as citizens used to
an implicit social contract with their government]{.underline}
---security and prosperity in exchange for loyalty--- [find governments
unable to uphold their end of the bargain]{.underline}.

U.S. disengagement from the Middle East. [[Declining **U.S.**---and
**global**---dependence on oil from th]{.mark}e [M]{.mark}iddle
[E]{.mark}ast [will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely **[[accelerate U.S.
disengagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from the region]{.underline}.
After the failure of President George W. Bush's efforts to "transform"
the Middle East in part through the invasion of Iraq, President Barack
Obama sought gradually to "pivot" away from the region, in part due to
the diminishing U.S. need for energy imports from the region.15
President Donald Trump has taken that view to an extreme, boasting about
American energy "independence"16 and claiming previous presidents had
wasted US\$7 trillion17 trying to stabilize a region allegedly no longer
a vital interest of the United States. A growing number of Americans
agree with former top official Martin Indyk, who recently asserted in
the Wall Street Journal that the Middle East just "isn't worth it
anymore,"18 in large part because "the United States no longer relies on
imported petroleum." The strategic importance of American energy
"independence," of course, can be exaggerated19, because even if the
United States doesn't import oil directly from the Persian Gulf, it has
a stake in the free flow of oil from the region so long as other
countries---including many close U.S. partners and allies---do. And the
United States will continue to have other national interests in the
region, including containing Iran, supporting Israel, counter-terrorism
and nonproliferation. Still, [the perception that securing imports from
the region might no longer be worth American blood and treasure makes
**future U.S. engagement** in the region **less likely**,
[increasing]{.mark} the [prospects of a **security vacuum**,
**conflict** among states, and **competition** among]{.mark} outside
actors such as [**Russia**, **China**]{.mark}, and
**Turkey**]{.underline}.

**[Link -- Arctic]{.underline}**

#### Almost all electricity in the arctic comes from diesel oi.

Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, "Expanding nuclear energy to the
Arctic: The potential of small modular reactors," July 22, 2021,

[The Arctic currently suffers from a dearth of renewable electricity
generation]{.underline}, despite copious opportunities. [Roughly half of
the Arctic's populations live in remote locations, requiring off-grid
systems; consequently, **approximately 80 percent of Arctic communities
depend exclusively on diesel generators for electricity**]{.underline}.
Despite the region's abundance of natural resources, [most diesel fuel
is imported,]{.underline} threatening energy security with both
increased costs and the likelihood of shortages. While wind, solar, and
hydropower are also viable green alternatives to fossil fuels, each
comes with its own disadvantages in comparison to SMRs. Wind turbines
are not yet adapted to the harsh Arctic conditions with persistent
temperatures below -- forty degrees Celsius. They likewise carry an
environmental impact related to land use and interference with wildlife,
especially migratory birds. Solar energy systems also require extensive
land to reach higher levels of production, and their effectiveness is
limited in the Arctic winter. Hydropower requires large initial
investments and may have severe environmental impacts, especially if a
large storage lake is necessary. SMRs can overcome all these challenges
given their low start-up costs, use of uranium (which is abundant in the
Arctic), and minor environmental footprint.

imports]{.underline}. Collapses prices and [turns
emissions]{.underline}.**

Middle Eastern Oil Exporters: A Review of Economic Implications and
Mitigation Strategies," p. 6-11, DOI: 10.30573/KS\--2022-DP16)

[This review of empirical studies confirms that [Middle Eastern]{.mark}
oil [exporters are **negatively impacted** by low]{.mark} oil [prices
and **require sustained** ]{.mark}**oil [rents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Indeed, [oil [rents]{.mark} not only [support]{.mark} growth but also
[the **social welfare system**]{.mark}]{.underline} linking oil
exporting countries' governments to their populations (Fattouh and Sen
2021). [This]{.underline} welfare system [consists]{.underline} mainly
[[of]{.mark} public sector [employment]{.mark}, low taxation,
[and]{.mark} other social [transfers]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hertog 2017).
Welfare schemes are common in all resource-exporting countries, but they
are particularly robust in oil exporting countries (Ross 2015). This
redistribution of oil rents results in economic inefficiencies.
Nevertheless, high oil revenues allow the GCC countries to achieve
strong macroeconomic, fiscal and political stability (Elbadawi and
Makdisi 2020). In turn, [declining rents may create
**acute**]{.underline} political [**instability** in these
countries]{.underline}. Bjorvatn and Naghavi (2011) show that
significant [declines in **oil rents** may]{.underline} significantly
[increase the possibility of **internal conflict**]{.underline}. Rent
seeking is more likely to affect these countries when rents are less
abundant. **[Advanced]{.underline}** global **[climate
policies]{.underline}** are expected to [create risks like those
associated with declining **oil prices**]{.underline} for oil exporting
countries. These potential risks were first acknowledged in 1992 in
Article 4.8 of the treaty that established the UNFCCC (U.N. 1992). The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014) reaffirmed that
climate mitigation policies may create revenue losses for fossil fuel
exporters by devaluing fossil fuel assets. Middle Eastern oil exporters
are therefore viewed as opposing advances in climate negotiations
(Depledge 2008). However, the global consensus regarding the need for
urgent measures to reduce emissions is growing. Thus, some nations,
including major oil exporters, have recently shifted from opposing
climate policies to becoming more receptive to them (Al-Sarihi and Mason
2020; Ramady and Mahdi 2015). Global [[climate policies to
**reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark} overall carbon dioxide
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and meet the PA's objectives
[**pose a threat** to]{.mark} Middle Eastern [oil exporters]{.mark}.
These policies will significantly alter the outlook for oil
demand]{.underline} and prices, [[putting]{.mark} **more
[stress]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} oil [exporters' **state
budgets**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Researchers have developed different oil
demand outlooks that are in line with the PA's objectives. Ansari, Holz
and Al-Kuhlani (2019) and Dagnachew et al. (2019) provide comparative
analyses of these various energy outlooks. A widely referenced demand
outlook that is consistent with the PA is the Sustainable Development
Scenario (SDS) created by the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2019).
In this scenario, global oil demand is 35.6 million barrels per day
(MMb/d) in 2040, or 32.6% lower than its level in the reference
scenario. [**[Mitigating]{.mark}** the [use of fossil fuels will]{.mark}
**significantly [curtail]{.mark} oil [demand]{.mark}** in major
importers of Middle Eastern oil]{.underline} (Table 2). Most of the gap
between the SDS and the reference scenario comes from the transport
sector. This sector's oil demand is 27.0 MMb/d lower in the SDS than in
the reference scenario. The difference stems from a combination of fuel
efficiency improvements and electric mobility penetration (IEA 2019).
Many countries have pledged to ban cars with internal combustion engines
in the coming years and have provided incentives to increase electric
vehicle use (Burch and Gilchrist 2018). These policies are expected to
increase the electric vehicle stock to almost 900 million units by 2040,
displacing 9.2 MMb/d of oil demand (IEA 2017). The potential economic
consequences of the data in Table 2 remain uncertain. Even in scenarios
in line with the PA, such as the SDS of the IEA (2020a), the decline in
oil demand is not steep. Notably, demand in developing countries, such
as China and India, will decline more slowly. In the SDS, oil
consumption by non-OECD countries decreases by 0.6% per year on average
between 2019 and 2040. Consumption will be only 5.5 MMb/d less than
current consumption at this horizon (i.e., 46.8 MMb/d vs. 41.3 MMb/d)
(IEA 2020a). Thus, demand in developing countries will remain well above
OPEC's current production level of about 35 MMb/d (BP 2020).2 [Climate
policy will play a **critical role** in shaping importing countries'
demand]{.underline}. However, Middle Eastern exports will also depend on
resource availability, competitiveness, and policies in other oil
exporting regions (Finley 2012). If global efforts to mitigate carbon
dioxide emissions significantly impact oil demand, oil prices may fall.
In the SDS, oil prices stabilize at \$53/b (in 2019 dollars) by 2040,
43% less than in the IEA's (2020a) reference scenario. Even if oil
prices decline to this level, all Middle Eastern countries can continue
to derive substantial rents from oil exports. Their production costs are
a fraction of even the lowest projected oil prices.3 However, this
market-based logic provides only a partial picture of the possible
outcomes (Dale and Fattouh 2018). [The simple break-even oil
price]{.underline} (i.e., the price at which selling oil generates a
profit) [is distinct from the fiscal break-even oil price. The latter
price is that required to achieve the planned spending in the state
budget. The fiscal break-even price is **more relevant**]{.underline}
for many Middle Eastern oil exporters [because oil is their predominant
source of **public income.**]{.underline} Thus, it is the appropriate
metric for analyzing the economic implications of potential oil price
declines in Middle Eastern countries. For the five largest Middle
Eastern oil exporters in OPEC,4 the average physical extraction cost is
reported to be about \$10/b (Dale and Fattouh 2018). However, the fiscal
break-even prices for these countries are higher and have remained well
above international oil prices in recent years (Table 3). Some Middle
Eastern oil exporters have significantly reduced their fiscal break-even
prices. However, these reductions did not result from broad structural
reforms (Arezki et al. 2018). They were instead mainly driven by
cyclical measures, such as reducing public spending and utilizing
financial reserves accumulated when oil prices were high. Moreover,
unlike many commodity exporters, Middle Eastern oil exporters anchor
their currencies to the United States dollar (or to baskets of
currencies, as do Kuwait and Iran). These currency pegs limit
policymakers' ability to use independent monetary policy to stabilize
shocks, leaving only fiscal actions as possible stabilization tools
(Wills and van der Ploeg 2014). These cyclical measures have not brought
fiscal break-even prices below or even close to international oil
prices. Thus, Middle Eastern oil exporters' fiscal indicators have
deteriorated. In 2014, the average government fiscal balance for the
five oil exporters listed in Table 3 was a surplus of 2.8% of gross
domestic product (GDP). By 2016, they had an average deficit of 7.2% of
GDP. Although their fiscal balances improved by 2019, with deficits
amounting to 0.9% of GDP on average, these countries' overall public
debt rose significantly. Whereas debt represented only 12.4% of GDP on
average across the five countries in 2014, it reached 31.6% of GDP on
average in 2019. These debt levels are moderate by international
standards. However, this rapid deterioration linked with declining oil
price raises questions about their future sustainability. Ultimately,
the development outlooks for oil exporting countries are uncertain owing
to increasingly stringent climate policies. Assessing the economic
implications of advanced global climate policies for oil exporting
countries is a major focus of policymakers, particularly in the Middle
East (Barnett 2008; Ramady and Mahdi 2015). These implications are among
the most debated topics in climate negotiations. Various modeling tools
are used to determine whether climate policies will create economic
losses or benefits for oil exporters and the magnitudes of these
impacts. The models' results depend on a wide range of modeling
characteristics, including the regional breakdown, the scope of
emissions, and the time horizon. Various assumptions that cannot be
determined with certainty may also alter the models' outcomes. For
instance, models use different assumptions about the coverage of
international policy regimes. The ability to substitute between various
energy sources and the costs of doing so vary across models. Models
assume different rates of technological innovation and future energy
supply availability as well (Ansari, Holz and Al-Kuhlani 2019; Dagnachew
et al. 2019; Nikas, Doukas and Papandreou 2019). Barnett, Dessai and
Webber (2004) review six different estimates of the expected
implications of the Kyoto Protocol for oil exporting countries published
in 1999 and 2000. The Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce the emissions of 37
industrialized countries. All six models indicate that oil exporting
countries will suffer losses if climate policies are implemented in
industrialized countries. The specific estimates of these losses differ
across the six models owing to their different approaches and
assumptions. However, the expected losses from the Kyoto Protocol's
implementation compared to a business-as-usual scenario are generally
estimated to be about 10% of oil revenues. Table 4 provides an updated
literature review, presenting estimates from models of climate policy
impacts published since 2003. Seven of the nine studies referenced in
Table 4 find that [climate policies mainly result in **losses** for
**oil exporting countries**]{.underline}. Moreover, [these seven studies
suggest that Middle Eastern [countries bear the **highest mitigation
costs**]{.mark} if climate policies are implemented]{.underline}. These
costs may be measured as shares of oil export revenues or as shares of
GDP. The high mitigation costs arise because [the Middle East is
**highly dependent** on oil revenues]{.underline}. The models typically
find that the revenue losses for Middle Eastern oil exporters result
from oil price declines rather than from export volume reductions.
Indeed, the region has abundant and cost-competitive conventional oil
reserves, meaning that its exports are unlikely to drastically decline.
[Middle Eastern countries can leverage this cost advantage to increase
oil exports **now**, [under the threat of an **accelerated energy
transition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, doing so [[may **flood the
market** and drive]{.mark} oil [prices even lower]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby **[[aggravating]{.mark} oil [rent losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Waisman, Rozenberg and Hourcade 2013).5

The green paradox logic applies to a second class of perverse
consequences, however, that is specific to the context of carbon
emissions. This is the impact on global warming of innovation in clean
energy. [One would]{.underline} like to [**think** that innovation in
clean energy **helps**]{.underline} [the battle against]{.underline}
global **[warming]{.underline}**. [But consider the discovery of a
low-cost **clean energy substitute**]{.underline}.
[[Suppose]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the current price of oil is 100
dollars per barrel and that an [**innovation** in clean energy
**suddenly yields a**]{.mark}]{.underline} perfect **[[substitute for
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** at a cost equivalent to, say, 60 dollars per
barrel. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} innovation [[will]{.mark}
[lead]{.mark} immediately \[[to a]{.mark}\] [**drop** in]{.mark}
\[[the]{.mark}\] **[price of oil]{.mark}** below 60
dollars]{.underline}. [[This **drop**]{.mark} in price [will
**raise**]{.mark} **the [demand]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} fossil [fuels
and]{.mark} therefore **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline} carbon
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The stock of all oil
[reserves]{.mark}]{.underline} with extraction costs below 60 dollars
[[will be sold **more quickly**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the carbon
emissions from this stock released into the atmosphere earlier, than
without the innovation. [The impact is an increase in current emissions
and]{.underline} possibly an increase in the present value of damages
from global warming. The impact may even include [a **permanent
increase** in]{.underline} the path of **[global
temp]{.underline}**erature**[s]{.underline}**, as we shall see.

This chapter offers a high-level, relatively nontechnical overview of
the paradoxical impact of clean energy innovation. We can distinguish
among at least seven versions of the innovation green paradox:

1\. The impact of clean energy innovation in increasing current carbon
emissions. This could be called the "weak green paradox" of clean energy
innovation, following Gerlag (2010).

2\. The impact of innovation in increasing the present value of damages
from global warming --- defined by Gerlag as a decrease in "green
welfare." This type of effect is referred to in the literature as a
"strong green paradox."

3\. An even stronger paradox with an impact of innovation decreasing not
just green welfare but total welfare. If the increase in present value
of damages more than offsets the gains from savings in energy costs,
then total welfare falls. It is this strongest paradox that is relevant
for policy in the sense of determining whether energy innovation --- in
a second-best world, without carbon pricing --- is even beneficial.

4\. An ex ante green paradox that results from the possibility of
innovation, as opposed to the realization of innovation. [[The **mere
threat** of innovation leads to]{.mark} **more [rapid
extraction]{.mark}** of fossil fuels and therefore
accelerated]{.underline} carbon [emissions]{.underline} and higher
global warming in the near term.

5\. A long-term green paradox. In the models usually adopted in the
literature, clean energy innovation must help in the long run as
innovation reduces total emissions. Even the effect of accelerating
emission helps in the long run in these models, when the stock of
atmospheric carbon is assumed to decline exponentially. [[When we
allow]{.mark} for positive **[feedback effects]{.mark}** in climate
dynamics, however, the acceleration of carbon [emissions can **push us
over** a **tipping point**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Innovation can lead
to **permanently higher temp**]{.underline}]{.mark}erature.

6\. [The impact of clean energy innovation [in a **first-best world** in
which **carbon taxes**]{.mark} [enable]{.mark} a social planner to
implement the [optimal allocation]{.mark} of resources]{.underline}.
Such innovation must improve overall welfare, since extraction costs and
global warming costs are lowered for each consumption plan by the social
planner. Yet [even in this **first-best world**]{.underline},
[[clean]{.underline}]{.mark} energy [[innovation can
make]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[warming
**worse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Paradoxically, even the social planner
may respond to the sudden availability of a clean energy substitute by
allowing the global warming problem to worsen.

7\. The impact of innovation on optimal carbon taxes in a first-best
world. One might think that clean energy innovation reduces the need for
high carbon taxes. With a drop in the cost of the clean energy backstop,
however, we will show that the implementation of the first-best may
require an increase in the optimal carbon tax. Innovation in clean
energy, that is, may raise the marginal social cost of emissions even at
the first-best optimum.

**Innovating [early]{.underline} triggers the green paradox, innovating
[later]{.underline} avoids it.**

6.3.2 The Ex ante Strong Green Paradox

As discussed, we can disentangle two dimensions of the strong green
paradox. The first is the ex ante strong green paradox . If we move from
the innovation-impossible scenario with the
innovation-possible-but-not-realized scenario, is there an increase or a
decrease in the present value of global warming damages? [[The impact
of]{.underline}]{.mark} this shift, namely the impact of [the threat of
[**innovation** is to]{.mark} [move]{.mark} the entire distribution of
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}, c − 1 ( b0 ), **[[closer in
time]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [and to increase the average
**intensity** of emissions over the extraction phase]{.underline}.

It is possible that moving emissions closer to the present can reduce
the present value of global damages. This is yet another surprising
result in global warming dynamics. Consider the movement of a single
unit of emissions from the future to the present, and ask if this can
reduce the present value of damages. Suppose that (1) the stock of
atmospheric carbon is rising over time as emissions accumulate, until
reaching a peak at or before the end of the extraction period (the stock
must then decline after the extraction period under our assumptions
because the stock decays at a constant rate), and (2) that the damage
function is extremely convex. Under these two suppositions, the main
impact of a unit of emissions, whenever it occurs, is its contribution
to the stock of atmospheric carbon near the peak of the stock. A unit of
carbon emitted near the peak will have a bigger impact than the same
unit emitted much earlier, because of the rate of decay in the unit once
it is added to the stock. Thus moving a unit of emissions from the
future (near the peak of carbon concentrations) to the present will,
under these conditions, reduce the present value of damages.

This example, however, relies on a significant rate of decay of
atmospheric carbon. It is the decay that makes early emissions at the
margin less costly than later emissions in the example. With a
sufficiently low rate of decay, [[earlier emissions are **more costly**
and]{.mark} therefore the lower price under the innovation [we get
a]{.mark}n ex ante **strong green [paradox]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
[[**merely the threat** of]{.mark} increased [innovation]{.mark} is
enough to **exacerbate**]{.underline} the global [warming problem
because it [leads to]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[faster]{.underline}]{.mark}** rate of the [[**accumulation**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} atmospheric **[[carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

6.3.3 The Ex post Strong Green Paradox

Figure 6.1 reveals as well the trade-off involved in determining whether
realized innovation helps or hurts total welfare. One effect is the
increase in emissions immediately instead of in the future. This
increases the present value of damages if the rate of decay, λ, is
sufficiently small. The second effect is the reduction in total
emissions (which, for an early innovation, equals c − 1 ( b0 ) − c − 1 (
b1 )). [This second effect is beneficial]{.underline},
**[but]{.underline}** if the amount of fuels remaining to be exhausted
is high, [the beneficial effect is not felt until **well into the
future**]{.underline}. It is possible, [if [innovation
occurs]{.mark}]{.underline} at a **[[sufficiently
early]{.underline}]{.mark}** date, that [total [welfare
**falls**]{.mark} with innovation]{.underline}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} immediate positive [[**impact** on
emissions]{.mark} may **[overwhelm]{.mark}** the]{.underline}
**[[long]{.underline}]{.mark}**er **[[run]{.underline}]{.mark}** welfare
**[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[If innovation occurs]{.mark}
**sufficiently [late]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even over the period in
which fossil fuel is being extracted, [[there can be
**no**]{.underline}]{.mark} strong **[green
[paradox]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**Oil firms are resisting renewables now for a
[reason]{.underline}\-\--transition would devastate profits.**

Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 158,

4\. Discussion and conclusions

The results from the stranded assets and profitability analyses suggest
that t[he upstream fossil fuel industry---low-cost and high-cost
producers alike---faces strong economic incentives to
continue]{.underline} on the path [of **[resisting climate
stabilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The main results include that
[climate stabilization [will lead to a **devaluation** of fossil fuel
reserves of]{.mark} 37--50%, or \$13**-\$17 trillion**]{.underline}.
Most of [this]{.underline} devaluation (51%--63%) [stems from price
decreases for fuels still extracted and sold during climate
stabilization, and [**76%** will fall on **governments**]{.mark}. Fossil
fuel [firms have]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[remained]{.mark}
significantly [**more profitable** than renewable]{.mark} energy
firm[s]{.mark} and can expect to [suffer **major profit
losses**]{.mark}]{.underline} even [**[in the short-term]{.mark}** from
climate stabilization.]{.underline} I conclude by considering the
implications of these results for two approaches to overcoming this
resistance: (1) appeasing the industry, and (2) defeating it.

The appeasement approach attempts to entice the industry to change,
designing climate policies and international agreements so as to induce
industry into taking a leading role in remaking the energy system. In
addition to other incentives, this approach would likely require
compensation, including for the \$13-\$17 trillion in stranded assets,
and policies to ensure comparable profitability in renewable energy. 25

In terms of compensation, it is instructive to consider the cases of the
U.S. and the Middle East. Firms in North America---mostly the
U.S.---face the prospect of \$2-\$3 trillion of stranded assets. This is
less than the \$3.5 trillion the U.S. Federal Government has spent on
COVID-19 relief as of September 30, 2021 \[ 82 \]. The U.S. is also home
to ample clean energy resources, which provides U.S.-based fossil fuel
firms with opportunities to transition investments to clean energy
production. Compensation, thus, may be feasible in the U.S., at least
economically.

[[In the **Middle**]{.mark} **[East]{.mark}**, [stranded assets amount
to]{.mark} \$4-\$[6 trillion]{.mark} in losses]{.underline}---about
[one-third of total stranded assets worldwide---a sum [**larger**
than]{.mark} the region\'s **[g]{.mark}**ross **[d]{.mark}**omestic
**[p]{.mark}**roduct]{.underline} \[ 83 \]. [[Governments]{.mark}
control most fossil fuel production in the region and [rely on it
for]{.mark} government **[revenue]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The fiscal
breakeven oil prices across the region in 2020---that is, the crude oil
price required for governments to balance their budgets---ranged from
\$46-\$194 per barrel \[ 84 \]. Compensation thus would have to come
from the international community. [[International compensation]{.mark}
at this level]{.underline}---\$4-\$6 trillion---[[is]{.mark} **highly
[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially without major strings
attached. The [appeasement]{.underline} approach on its own, therefore,
[is not economically **feasible.**]{.underline}

[Keeping]{.underline} two thirds of [reserves in the ground necessitates
[a significant reduction in the world's use of fossil fuels]{.mark}.
This]{.underline}, in turn, [necessitates a long-term decline in the
demand for fossil fuels, which [could occur **if**]{.mark} governments
impose carbon taxes or similar policies]{.underline}; if **[[there is a
broad transition to alternative energy supplies, such as nuclear or
renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}**; or if economic activity becomes
significantly more efficient in using energy. [Reserves]{.underline} may
also [remain undeveloped if governments impose policies to limit the
market supply of fossil fuel resources]{.underline}. 5 [[A fall in
fossil fuel demand]{.underline}]{.mark}, other things equal, [[will lead
to a fall in fossil fuel prices]{.mark}. [This might lead to existing
reserves]{.mark} remaining undeveloped or **['stranded]{.mark}**'.
Meanwhile [projects that remain commercially viable will be less
valuable. This in turn may **diminish**]{.mark} the **[rents]{.mark}**
and therefore tax revenues fossil fuel extraction can generate for
producing countries]{.underline}. To understand this,
[consider]{.underline} an example from [the global oil
market]{.underline}. The price received for a barrel of oil is roughly
the same for all projects after accounting for relatively small
differences in the quality of oil (such as viscosity) and transport
costs. However, costs will differ considerably across location and
geology. Figure 2 shows a representative global supply curve that ranks
all oil projects from least to most expensive in terms of unit costs of
production. For any given market price, lower cost projects, on the left
part of the supply curve, will have a higher asset value per barrel than
high cost projects. [If the]{.underline} producer [price falls, say in
response to a climate policy, some projects]{.underline} with costs
higher than the prevailing price [will become stranded]{.underline},
while some [**[value]{.mark}** of]{.underline} all remaining operating
[projects **[will be foregone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Asset stranding
and significant falls in values in the fossil fuel industry are not new,
the recent commodity price slump has stranded many projects already and
fossil fuel companies have seen the value of their assets reduced by
many millions of dollars. However, [the scale of such an outcome
under]{.underline}, for example, [an effective global climate policy
would be entirely new]{.underline}. [It would]{.underline} also [imply a
permanence not normally considered during commodity price
slumps]{.underline}. For example, figure 3 shows estimates of the
proportion of reserves already discovered that could become permanently
stranded if the world keeps to its carbon budget.

179.3 Bcm in 2021, while Russia exported 241.3 Bcm. It is noteworthy
that these statistics highlight the United States' dominance in the
global natural gas market, as they produce the most while still managing

globally [and]{.underline} [holds considerable **sway** over **energy

[S]{.underline}tates significantly [impact the global]{.underline}

international [trade]{.underline}, meaning that even slight
[changes]{.underline} [in]{.underline} oil [prices]{.underline} can
considerably [impact the global]{.underline} [economy]{.underline}. The
cost of WTI crude oil directly affects the prices of gasoline, diesel
fuel, and other oil products, which, in turn, influences the expenses of
consumers and businesses. Furthermore, fluctuations in WTI crude oil
prices can also affect inflation, currency exchange rates, and even
political stability in regions that rely on the oil industry. Thus,
analysing WTI crude oil prices can help businesses and investors make
more informed decisions in their operations, and it can assist
governments in developing more effective political and economic
strategies amidst the uncertainty in the oil market.

[The combination of cheap renewables and natural gas]{.underline},
stemming from development of hydraulic fracturing, has [done precisely
what a price on carbon should aim to do]{.underline} under economic
dynamic theory: [make clean energy cheaper than dirty
energy]{.underline}. [As a result, coal-fired power plants have shut
down]{.underline} in the United States and some other countries.198
[Some of these shutdowns have occurred in areas where plant operators
face no regulation of greenhouse emissions through carbon pricing or
otherwise]{.underline}.199

An economic dynamic analysis built on these cases suggests that
[targeted policies may cost-effectively and systematically move us
toward zero emissions]{.underline}. [[When a single government secures
production of]{.mark} an affordable **[zero-emission
tech]{.mark}**nology, [markets]{.mark} can **[spread their
adoption]{.mark}**, and governments can more easily help the technology
along]{.underline}. [[Governments]{.mark} around the world **[need not
impose]{.mark}**]{.underline} a lot of [**[cost]{.mark}** [on the
**entire economy**]{.mark} to drive down the cost of zero-emission
technology]{.underline}. [Instead, [a]{.mark} [**single** government can
pay a **very small amount**]{.mark} **of money** to **[catalyze price
declines]{.mark}** in a transformative innovation, because the existing
capital stock of a new innovation is **so low**]{.underline}. 200

[The [**widespread adoption** of]{.mark} a **[key tech]{.mark}**nology
[can trigger]{.mark} the **[collapse of]{.mark}** carbon
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a sector. If all drivers
eventually purchase zero-emission vehicles, oil companies will stop
producing gasoline in response to the disappearance of demand and have
powerful incentives to invest in alternatives to fossil fuels. 201
[Thus, a key technology has ripple effects that mean a modest initial
cost for an **[ambitious change in a tiny]{.mark} corner** of a
**[market]{.mark}** can [have **transformative
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Indeed, this is how transformative innovation often works. A technology
gets a start as a luxury commodity for those few people who can pay a
lot for it, and producers eventually figure out how to lower costs so
the innovation eventually becomes widespread. Government, economic
dynamic theory teaches, serves as a source of demand for environmental
quality, and when a government demands a lot, even in a small, targeted
corner of the economy, it can have substantial effects. 202

[Now that renewable energy costs less than coal-fired power
production]{.underline},23 [no pricing problem prevents shutting down
the remaining coal-fired power plants]{.underline}. **[[Getting the
price right has]{.underline}]{.mark}** little or [**[nothing to do with
it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Instead]{.underline}**, the [limitations
impeding further deployment of renewable energy involve]{.underline} the
difficulty of [relying on very large amounts of intermittent energy
without any ability to store it efficiently, failures to extend
transmission lines, and local resistance to siting new renewable energy
installations]{.underline}. 204

To the extent that a 100% renewable energy system is not possible, one
would probably have to rely on nuclear power to get to zero emissions.
Pricing policies have not increased demand for nuclear energy, and it is
difficult to imagine that they ever would.

[[**Alternatives** to pricing]{.underline}]{.mark} policies [[that
**directly encourage** zero-emission tech]{.mark}nologies and enable
systems to break technological lock-in **[do much better]{.mark}** in
encouraging transformative change than carbon **pricing**]{.underline}.
[The history of meaningful technological change in the climate space
also suggests that viewing policy as a problem of optimizing fixed costs
**constitutes a fundamental mistake**]{.underline}. Instead,
[[governments can]{.mark} make a lot of progress by establishing
measures that **[drive]{.mark} the [costs of clean tech]{.mark}nology

9\. Conclusions:

This paper discusses the impacts and the implications of low oil prices
on the regional stability and security [in the Gulf region]{.underline}.
As per theoretical related aspects, the paper has considered empirical
evidence that shows a correlation between [high oil prices]{.underline}
and inter-state conflict potential and instability. The paper has
focused on discussing how [Gulf countries]{.underline} have developed
their nation-building processes. They have evolved and developed by
considering the importance of engaging in integration processes which
would [ensure **domestic cohesion** and **regional security**. These
strategies have been **underpinned**]{.underline} and funded [by
**oil**]{.underline} revenues and these nations despite being aware of
their dependency on these resources have made little progress in
successfully diversifying their economies.

The [internal [stability in Gulf countries has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
equally [[funded]{.mark} by revenues [from oil by establishing a
**social contract**]{.mark} with the **aim**]{.underline}ing
[[of]{.mark} **[guaranteeing loyalty]{.mark}** to the
regime]{.underline} and a sense of belonging. Although important
episodes of low oil prices have challenged these economies in the past,
the radical changes that conduced to explosion of the Arab Spring and
the following aftermaths have added increasing quotas of uncertainty to
the entire economic, political, social and diplomatic ecosystem of the
Gulf.

The [Gulf [monarchies **pressed** by]{.mark} these
[societal]{.mark}]{.underline}, economic, cultural and political
[[forces]{.mark} have tried to mitigate their potential meltdown by
sponsoring and]{.underline} by [**[buy]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} with
high sums of money and resources [**[new loyalties]{.mark}**, new
balances [and]{.mark} **new [alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
parallel these economies have been investing massively in weaponry
considering the long-standing rivalries and conflicts with neighboring
countries such as Iran. This investment strategy has been spurred by
high oil prices between 2010 and 2014.

[From]{.underline} mid-[2014]{.underline} onwards, international [oil
prices plummeted and Gulf countries started to experience]{.underline}
fiscal [deficits which did not allow them to continue with their
generous subsidies and policies to ensure]{.underline} both
[domestic]{.underline} and international [security]{.underline} and
stability. Despite the negative economic and financial prospect, these
countries continued their policy of high investments on weaponry,
especially Saudi Arabia and Oman. Gulf countries challenged by an
international context where the disengagement of the US has been
progressive, had tried to rehearse new diplomatic, political and
economic formulas to allow them to progress as a Union, although lately
the GCC has been acting more as a Council undergoing several pressures
and transformations. A long-lasting context of sliding oil prices have
generated more regional atomization as Gulf states aim at maximizing,
individually or in coalition, their benefits within an environment of
latent conflict. In this vein, [[low oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [**[generated]{.mark} more [uncertainty]{.mark}** [and
**insecurity**]{.mark} in the entire region, **[endangering]{.mark}**
the continuity of the [**current regimes** and **boosting**]{.mark} the
potential for **[conflict]{.mark}** and instability.]{.underline}

Considering this scenario, and in accepting that the global oil demand

I do not wish to say that Iran's present government is without serious
faults. However, any use of violence against Iran would be both
~~insane~~ and criminal. Why ~~insane~~? Because the present economy of
the US and the world cannot support another large-scale conflict;
because [[the **Mid**]{.mark}dle **[East]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
already a deeply troubled region; and because it is impossible to
predict the extent of [a war]{.underline} which, if [once started,
[might develop into **World War III**]{.mark}]{.underline}, given the
fact that Iran is closely allied with both Russia and China. Why
criminal? Because such violence would violate both the UN Charter and
the Nuremberg Principles. There is no hope at all for the future unless
we work for a peaceful world, governed by international law, rather than
a fearful world, where brutal power holds sway.

An attack on Iran could escalate

We recently passed the 100th anniversary World War I, and we should
remember that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what
was intended to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that an attack on
Iran would escalate into a large-scale war in the Middle East, entirely
destabilizing a region that is already deep in problems.

[The]{.underline} unstable [government of [Pakistan might be
**overthrown**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the revolutionary
Pakistani government might [enter the war]{.mark} on the side of Iran,
thus **[introducing nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** into the
conflict. [Russia and China]{.mark}, firm allies of Iran, [might]{.mark}
also [be **drawn into a general war**]{.mark} in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

In the dangerous situation that could potentially result from an attack
on Iran, there is a risk that [**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon[**s** would
be used]{.mark}, either [intentionally]{.mark}, [or by **accident** or
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Recent research has shown that
besides [[making]{.mark} large areas of [the world
**uninhabitable**]{.mark}]{.underline} through long-lasting radioactive
contamination[, a nuclear war would damage global agriculture to such a
extent that [a **global famine**]{.mark} of previously **unknown
proportions** would result.]{.underline}

Thus, [nuclear war is the ultimate ecological catastrophe. It [could
**destroy**]{.mark} **human [civilization]{.mark}** and much of the
**biosphere**.]{.underline} To risk such a war would be an unforgivable
offense against the lives and future of all the peoples of the world, US
citizens included.

Recent research has shown that [**thick [clouds of smoke]{.mark}** from
firestorms in burning cities would rise to the stratosphere, where they
[would **spread globally**]{.mark} and remain for a
**decade**,]{.underline} blocking the hydrological cycle, [and
**[destroying]{.mark} the [ozone]{.mark} layer**]{.underline}. [[A

Regional Order and U.S. Diplomacy,"

[For U.S. strategists seeking to thwart rising Chinese hegemony or
Russian military imperialism, the idea of America leaving a volatile
Middle East to its fate may sound appealing]{.underline}. Civil war in
Syria and Yemen coupled with the troubled democracies in Iraq and Sudan
are only a few examples showcasing Washington's ongoing regional
challenges. President Biden's withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan
in August 2021 perhaps reflected the country's general frustration with
America's Middle East engagement over the past two decades. Indeed, U.S.
ambivalence towards recent Iran-backed Houthi strikes against Saudi and
Emirate oil facilities suggest that Washington is ready to accept
broader strategic disengagement from the region, come what may. But
[**strategic [disengagement]{.mark}** from the Middle East to focus
on]{.underline} China and a war-bound [Russia will]{.underline} likely
**[[come at high cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for
Washington]{.underline}. Indeed, [[without a U.S.-supported Middle East
security architecture]{.mark}, the [**long simmering tensions** could
**erupt into a firestorm of region wide conflict**]{.mark} inevitably
[requiring American]{.mark} military [intervention]{.mark} to prevent an
oil crisis or renewal of transnational terrorism]{.underline}. [This
would **completely undermine** Washington's desire to pivot strategic
focus towards the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. But [insuring
against]{.underline} [negative outcomes in the Middle
East]{.underline}---the region of traditional U.S. focus---also
[provides the opportunity for the rise of positive outcomes in economic
growth and institutional development. This would]{.underline} not only
provide positive trade benefits for the U.S., but it would also [promote
an American friendly regional order while limiting the growing influence
of China and Russia]{.underline}. **[Fortunately]{.underline}**, [the
tools to prevent strategic crises and promote Middle East regional
growth lie increasingly less in military capacity and more in the realm
of **diplomatic** and economic engagement. This **excess of military
capacity** in the Middle East could prove **highly valuable** in the
**Indo-Pacific** and **Eastern Europe**.]{.underline}

**[[A]{.mark} POTENTIAL [NUCLEAR POWDER KEG IN THE
MAKING]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[These attacks by [Iranian]{.mark} irregular-proxy forces, combined with
their **[turnkey nuclear program]{.mark}**, suggests that the U.S.
maximum pressure strategy has placed America's interests of regional
stability and energy security at serious risk]{.underline}.
Additionally, U.S. disengagement from the region---signaled by America's
reluctance to counter Iran's attacks---[has [led the Arab-Israeli
coalition to]{.mark} determine that [accelerat]{.mark}ing a conventional
weapons [buildup]{.mark} is the only way to ensure their own
protection]{.underline}.\[7\] [U.S. disengagement, Arab-Israeli arms
buildup, and Iranian asymmetric warfare may have the potential to become
its own cycle of violence and instability]{.underline}. **[[Left
unchecked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[this cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[contain **grave risk of escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark}
towards regional conflict---one in which [[Iran
could]{.underline}]{.mark} resort to [[complet]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[its nuclear]{.mark} weapons [program and spark **incipient
proliferation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A Middle Eastern
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark} between Iran and an Arab-Israeli coalition
[could [place]{.mark} the [security of the Hormuz Strait and Suez Canal
at risk, requiring]{.mark} active [intervention by]{.mark} the [European
and Asian powers]{.mark} whose economies fundamentally rely on the
energy and trade flow from these vital trade corridors]{.underline}.
Some may argue that with America's limited energy imports from the
region, these outside powers should be the ones to resolve such a
conflict.\[8\] But allowing other great powers such as China, Russia,
and others to rewrite the Middle East's security architecture with the
U.S. on the sidelines is not in the geopolitical interests of the
American government. To prevent such an outcome, finishing a renewed
nuclear deal is a central imperative for U.S. interests.

5 Places **[[World War III Could Erupt]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Any honest appraisal of]{.underline} US [policy towards Iran now
recognizes that]{.underline} then-President Donald [Trump's decision to
abandon the]{.underline} Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
([JCPOA]{.underline}), better known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, [was a
**disastrous mistake.**]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} US [effort to increase military and economic
[coercion]{.mark} against Iran [has **failed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Iran]{.mark} has **[stepped up its nuclear
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [while [improving]{.mark} the
**[sophistication]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of its]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[missile forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and increasing]{.underline}
its **[covert activities]{.underline}** [across the region.]{.underline}

Negotiations have thus far failed to restore the status quo, as the
United States has stumbled over its inability to commit and Tehran has
taken a tough attitude. [[If negotiations fail]{.mark} to bring Iran
into]{.underline} some kind of **[a deal]{.underline}**, [the threat of
**military action** lurks]{.underline} in the background. While the
Biden administration doesn't seem excited about the prospect of war,
[**[US allies]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[Riyadh]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Jerusalem]{.underline}**
[could]{.underline}]{.mark} try to **[[trigger a]{.mark}

**[Saudi Stable Now]{.underline}**

**Saudi oil revenue is strong and key to growth.**

Arabian economic growth to accelerate in 2025 as oil taps open: Reuters
poll," Reuters,
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabian-economic-growth-accelerate-2025-oil-taps-open-2024-10-23/)

[Economic [**growth** in Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [will
**accelerate**]{.mark} next year [thanks]{.mark} [to **higher oil
output**]{.mark}]{.underline} after two years of modest performance,
according to a Reuters poll of economists, [who also forecast robust
growth]{.underline} for other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by
Russia, known as [[OPEC]{.underline}]{.mark}+, [[has been
curbing]{.mark} oil [output]{.mark} [since]{.mark} late [2022 but is
expected to increase production]{.mark} in December]{.underline}, likely
**[boosting revenues]{.underline}** [for the six GCC
countries]{.underline}.

Crude oil prices are expected to remain broadly weak and average \$76.75
per barrel next year, up from around \$74.8 currently, according to a
separate Reuters poll.

[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, the world\'s largest exporter of crude oil,
[is]{.underline} reportedly [preparing to abandon its unofficial target
of reaching \$100 per barrel. This will allow the kingdom to reverse
past production cuts and increase market share]{.underline}, which along
with non-oil revenue growth, will help drive faster economic growth.

The Oct. 9-22 Reuters poll of 21 economists forecast the Saudi economy
would expand 4.4% in 2025, the fastest in three years, and up from an
expected 1.3% this year.

The GCC economies were forecast to expand an average 4.1% next year, up
from the 3.7% expected in a July poll and faster than the 1.8% growth
projected for 2024.

\"[We expect the effects of **[lower]{.mark} oil [prices]{.mark}** [and
**higher production volumes**]{.mark} (to) largely (**[offset]{.mark}**)
[each other]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since growth is focusing on produced
volumes, [[real]{.mark} GDP [growth will still benefit]{.mark} and
accelerate in 2025 relative to 2024]{.underline},\" said Ralf Wiegert,
head of MENA economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Prominent economies in the region, [[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, [[have been exploring ways to
diversify]{.mark} from relying on oil as their main revenue
source]{.underline}, with many [economists predicting the growth rate in
non-oil GDP will be largely in line with oil GDP next year]{.underline}.

\"However, [[oil]{.mark} revenues will [play a critical
role]{.mark}]{.underline} [for]{.underline} all of the three
[economies]{.underline}. Even in the long-term outlook, [[**non-oil**
revenues will be **unable to replace** **oil**]{.mark}
revenues]{.underline},\" Wiegert said.

Key Rating Drivers

Balance Sheet Strength: [Saudi Arabia\'s ratings reflect
its]{.underline} [strong fiscal and external balance
sheets]{.underline}, with government debt/GDP [and sovereign net foreign
assets]{.underline} (SNFA) considerably stronger than both the \'A\' and
\'AA\' medians, and significant fiscal buffers in the form of deposits
and other public sector assets[.]{.underline} **[Oil
dependence]{.underline}**, low World Bank governance indicators [and
vulnerability to geopolitical **shocks** remain]{.underline} relative
**[weaknesses]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, governance is improving with
social and economic reforms and efforts to bolster effectiveness across
government institutions.

Formidable External Finances: Saudi Arabia has one of the highest
reserve coverage ratios among Fitch-rated sovereigns, at 16.5 months of
current external payments. Foreign reserves excluding gold declined
moderately in 2023, to USD437 billion, as financial account outflows in
the form of investments abroad outweighed the current account surplus,
which narrowed to an estimated 4.5% of GDP, around USD100 billion
smaller than in 2022, due to lower oil revenue and high imports.

We forecast reserves to decline to an average of USD420 billion in
2024-2025, as the current account surplus narrows on the assumption of
lower oil revenue, but that outward investments by large institutions
such as the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and pension funds moderate. We
forecast SNFA to remain above 50% of GDP in 2024-2025, large relative to
the \'A\' median (6% of GDP) and the \'AA\' median (34% of GDP),
although substantially lower than regional peers in the \'AA\' rating
category. SNFA include central bank foreign reserves as well as the
estimated foreign assets of pension funds and the PIF, minus the foreign
liabilities of the government, Saudi Central Bank (SAMA)and the PIF.

[Government Debt]{.underline} Rising but Low: Gross government debt/GDP
rose to 26.5% of estimated GDP in 2023, but [remained low]{.underline},
at roughly half the \'A\' median of 50%. We forecast that government
debt/GDP will increase to 28% in 2024 and 30% in 2025. This assumes that
Brent crude oil prices average USD80/bbl in 2024, USD70/bbl in 2025,
contributing to budget deficits and constraining nominal GDP. We assume
deficits are funded by borrowing, rather than asset drawdowns.

We estimate that government deposits at SAMA, comprising the government
current account and the fiscal reserve, were close to SAR450 billion
(11.4% of GDP) at end-2023. This represents a significant fiscal buffer
and puts net government debt at 15.1% of GDP.

Looser Fiscal Policy: Saudi Arabia\'s 2024 budget projects fiscal
deficits over the medium term, of around 2% of GDP, marking a shift away
from the previous set of medium-term figures that projected annual
surpluses and a decline in government debt/GDP. Spending ran 14% ahead
of budget in 2023 and in the latest projections spending in 2025 will be
15% higher than previously planned. This policy recalibration reflects a
decision to make more use of the fiscal space to support strong non-oil
economic growth and press ahead with economic and social priorities
under the Vision 2030 strategic development plan.

We forecast a budget deficit of 2.3% of GDP in 2024, similar to 2023 and
slightly ahead of the 1.9% of GDP budget plan. We expect spending 3.5%
above budget, at SAR1.3 trillion on higher capex and procurement. We
also assume revenue to be higher than budgeted and higher than in 2023,
despite our assumption that average oil production and prices will be
lower. Revenue will be supported by performance-related dividends from
Aramco. We forecast a wider budget deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2025,
assuming spending in line with budget plans, lower oil prices and higher
oil production (10 million b/d).

Oil Dependence High: [Oil dependence remains a rating
weakness.]{.underline} [Oil revenue will account for around **60% of
total budget**]{.underline} [revenue in 2024-2025]{.underline} (albeit
down from 90% 10 years ago) and oil GDP 30% of total nominal GDP. Saudi
Arabia\'s fiscal break-even oil price for the budget has risen in recent
years and we forecast it will remain above USD90/bbl in 2024 before
falling to USD85/bbl in 2025. A USD10/bbl movement in oil prices impacts
our budget forecast by 2%-2.5% of GDP, holding other factors constant. A
change in oil output by 500,000 b/d impacts the budget by around 1% of
GDP.

Non-Oil Economy Developing: An increase in public sector investments,
combined with a raft of social and economic reforms has boosted the
non-oil economy. We project real growth of 4.5% in the non-oil sector
(excluding government) in 2024-2025, following an average of around 5%
in 2022-2023. Growth will be supported by public sector investments,
business environment reform, gradually lower interest rates, robust
credit growth, ongoing development of retail and tourism sectors and
employment gains among Saudis and expats.

[Risks to the outlook include supply side constraints that could slow
the pace of public sector investments and **lower oil prices**, which
would complicate financing]{.underline} plans, in Fitch\'s view.

Vision 2030 Risks and Returns: Rising public-sector spending outside the
budget, including on ambitious giga projects, and the potential for
higher debt of state-owned and government-related entities (GREs), as
Saudi Arabia presses ahead with its national investment strategy as part
of Vision 2030, is a medium-term risk to the sovereign\'s balance-sheet
strengths, in Fitch\'s view. However, leverage is currently low across
the public sector and investments may bring returns, in the form of
sustained higher non-oil GDP growth, job creation to meet the expanding
national labour force and productivity gains.

[Regional Stability Risks: Saudi Arabia has]{.underline} sought to
[deescalate regional tensions]{.underline} in recent years,
[including]{.underline} a degree of [détente with Iran and]{.underline}
efforts towards [a]{.underline} formal [ceasefire in Yemen.]{.underline}
This has helped build confidence in the Kingdom, which is important for
attracting greater foreign investment and tourism flows.

The Israel-Gaza war has caused an increase in regional instability since
7 October. Saudi Arabia is not being directly impacted so far, but risks
of escalation persist from the ongoing nature of the conflict in Gaza,
the involvement of the Houthis from neighbouring Yemen in disrupting Red
Sea transit, the activity of other groups with links to Iran and US
reprisals against these groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria.

ESG - Governance: [Saudi Arabia has an ESG Relevance Score (RS) of \'5\'
for Political Stability]{.underline} and Rights and \'5\[+\]\' for the
Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of
Corruption. Theses scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank
Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating
Model. Saudi Arabia has a medium WBGI ranking at the 50th percentile
with low scores for Voice and Accountability, and Political Stability
and Absence of Violence constraining the average.

[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Aramco [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} \"fairly
**[[bullish]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[on China\'s oil demand]{.mark}
especially in light of the government\'s stimulus]{.underline} package
which aims to boost growth, the head of the state-owned oil giant aid on
Monday.

\"[We see more demand for **jet fuel** and naphtha especially for
liquid-to-chemical projects]{.underline},\" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said
on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week conference.

\"A lot of it [is happening in China]{.underline} mainly [because of the
growth in chemical needs]{.underline}. [Especially [for the
transition]{.mark}, for the electric vehicles, for the solar panels,
[they need more chemicals]{.mark}]{.underline}. So that\'s huge growth
there,\" Nasser said.

[Saudi Arabia is the no.2 oil exporter to China]{.underline} behind
Russia and holds stakes in some Chinese refiners.

Meanwhile, [progress in the energy transition in Asia is far
slower]{.underline}, much less equitable and more complicated than many
have expected, he told the conference, calling for a reset in policies
for developing countries.

Even with the transition, as economies expand and living standards rise,
[the Global South is [likely to see significant growth in oil demand for
a **long time**]{.mark}, and while that growth will stop at some point,
that is likely to be [followed by a **long
plateau**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Nasser said.

\"If so, [more than [100 million barrels per day]{.mark} would
realistically [still]{.mark} be [required by
2050]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he said in a speech at the Singapore
International Energy Week conference.

\"[This is [a **stark contrast** with those predicting that oil
will]{.mark}]{.underline}, or must, [[fall]{.underline}]{.mark} to just
25 million barrels per day by then. Being short 75 million barrels every
day would be devastating for energy security and affordability.\"

Countries should choose an energy mix that helps them meet their climate
ambitions at a speed and manner that is right for them, Nasser said.
\"Our main focus should be on the levers available now.\"

These include encouraging investments in oil and gas that developing
nations need and can afford, and prioritising the reduction of carbon
emissions associated with conventional sources by improving energy
efficiency and developing carbon capture, utilisation and storage
(CCUS).

[**[Despite]{.mark} trillions** of dollars being invested in
[the]{.mark} global energy [transition, **oil** and **coal demand** are
at **all-time highs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, dealing a \"hammer blow\" to
energy transition plans, he said.

Asia, which consumes over half of the world\'s energy supplies, still
relies on conventional resources for 84% of its energy needs. Rather
than displacing demand for conventional energy, alternatives are mostly
meeting consumption growth, he said.

The shift to electric vehicles (EV) in Asia, Africa and Latin America is
lagging that of China, the U.S. and European Union as consumers struggle
with affordability and infrastructure concerns, he said.

[The progress of EVs has no bearing on the other 75% of global oil
demand]{.underline}, Nasser said, as massive segments like heavy
transportation and petrochemicals have few economically viable
alternatives to oil and gas.

[Developing countries may require almost \$6 trillion each year to fund
the energy transition]{.underline}, and Nasser called for them to have a
greater say in climate policy-making.

### Oil Down Now

#### Oil demand and prices are declining now.

**Lawler '25** (Alex, "World oil demand, U.S. supply to grow more slowly
on tariff tensions, IEA says," April 15, 2025,
https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/iea-cuts-2025-world-oil-demand-growth-forecast-trade-tensions-2025-04-15/)

LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - [Global oil demand will grow at its
**slowest rate** for five years in 2025 and U.S. production rises will
also **taper off,** due to U.S. President Donald Trump's **tariffs** on
trading partners and their retaliatory moves]{.underline}, the
International Energy Agency said. [Trump\'s tariffs]{.underline}, along
with a supply hike by OPEC+ producers, **[have driven a steep slide in
oil prices this month]{.underline}**, **[cutting revenue for
producers]{.underline}**. [The U.S. oil industry,]{.underline} despite
calls by Trump to \"drill baby drill\", [may actually slow
activity,]{.underline} the IEA said. World oil demand this year will
rise by 730,000 barrels per day, the [IEA]{.underline}, which
[advises]{.underline} industrialised countries, said in a monthly report
on Tuesday, a [sharp cut]{.underline} from 1.03 million bpd expected
last month. The reduction is larger than a cut made on Monday by
producer group OPEC. \"[The deteriorating outlook for the global economy
amid the sudden sharp escalation in trade tensions in early April has
prompted a downgrade to our forecast for oil demand growth this
year]{.underline},\" the IEA said. \"Roughly half of this downgrade
occurs in the United States and China, with most of the remainder in
trade-oriented Asian economies.\" Growth of 730,000 bpd would be the
lowest since 2020, when demand contracted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Excluding the pandemic, it would be the lowest since 2019, when growth
was 540,000 bpd, the IEA said in response to a Reuters question. In its
first look at 2026, the IEA predicted a further slowdown in demand
growth to 690,000 bpd, due to a fragile economic backdrop and growing
penetration of electric vehicles. [In China, economic challenges and a

tensions and the decision of OPEC+ producers to accelerate a supply hike
in May. Crude edged lower on Tuesday after the IEA report\'s release.

Texas Intermediate crude was down 50 cents, or 0.75%, at \$66.50 just
before 1300 EDT (1700 GMT). Trade was sparse due to the U.S.
Independence Day holiday. Brent settled about 0.8% higher than last
Friday\'s close and WTI was around 1.5% higher. [Eight OPEC+ countries

Varga. \"[There seems to be some profit-taking on concerns that OPEC

Flynn, senior analyst with the Price Futures group. He added that
investors seem to be in wait-and-see mode, getting ready to react to
OPEC\'s move while also watching for implications of U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s massive package of tax and spending cuts, which was set
to be signed into law at a ceremony at the White House on Friday. [Crude

website Axios, [which said the United States was planning to resume
nuclear talks with Iran next week]{.underline}, while Iranian foreign
minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran remained committed to the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Meanwhile, uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy
was back in the spotlight as the end of a 90-day pause on higher levies
approaches. European Union negotiators have failed so far to achieve a
breakthrough in trade negotiations with the Trump administration and may
now seek to extend the status quo to avoid tariff hikes, six EU
diplomats briefed on the talks said on Friday.

despite current robust demand and higher prices.

Oil has recouped the losses from early June when the OPEC+ group\'s
indication that it could begin returning some supply to the market in
the fourth quarter sent bearish signals across the market.

Early on Friday, the international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded above
\$85 per barrel, while the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, was above \$82 a
barrel, as signs of tightening physical markets started to emerge.

[The market expects solid summer demand in the third quarter but fears
that the quarterly consumption growth will start **waning**]{.underline}

**downwards**.]{.underline}

Citi is one of the most prominent bears among major banks, expecting oil
to drop into the \$70s range later this year and further down to the
\$60s range in 2025 due to solid inventory builds.

\"Global inventories will be building a lot next year,\" Citi\'s global
energy strategist Eric Lee told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.

\"We do think that there is a bit of a tight stretch \[with supply\]
through the summer, so we do see prices staying in the low- to mid-80s

\*\*figures omitted

[U.S. demand for oil will fall dramatically]{.underline} over the next
three decades, [thanks to the]{.underline} Inflation Reduction Act
([IRA]{.underline}) [and other]{.underline} state and federal
transportation [policies]{.underline}, [according to new
modeling.]{.underline} Over the same time, U.S. exports of crude oil, as
well as natural gas, will rise significantly. These important [new
findings make clear]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does not need new]{.underline} offshore [oil and
gas]{.underline} leasing [to meet our national energy
needs.]{.underline}

The Department of Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is
charged with assessing the country's energy needs when it makes future
offshore leasing plans under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
(OCSLA). The Biden administration is poised to finalize a proposed plan
for the next five years of offshore leasing in September. The final plan
is expected to go into effect by the end of the year.

NRDC asked OnLocation, [an]{.underline} independent [energy analytics
firm]{.underline}, to [conduct]{.underline} projection
[analyses]{.underline} of how several different policy scenarios,
including with respect to offshore leasing, would affect certain energy,
economic, and climate-related outcomes---such as U.S. oil and natural
gas production, demand, imports/exports, and greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions---[over a 30-year time]{.underline} period from 2020 to 2050.
Our policy scenarios of interest included new offshore leasing---or
"business-as-usual"---versus no new offshore leasing. The chosen policy
scenarios also included "with vs. without" implementation of the most
recent state and federal clean energy policies for the transportation
sector, including tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),
electric vehicle targets adopted by California and five other states
under the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, and the Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) proposed GHG standards for cars and trucks. We were
interested to see how these clean energy policies interacted with
leasing policy, such as whether any demand drop due to the efficiency
policies was more or less than any production drop due to no new
offshore leasing.

Based on our policies of interest, OnLocation developed four scenarios
for analysis. These scenarios differ in two ways: first, whether or not
they include new offshore leasing; and second, which transportation and
clean energy policies they account for. Virtually all new offshore U.S.
oil leasing would occur in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the effects
of no new offshore leasing in the Gulf on outcomes like oil production
and demand are essentially the same as the effects of no new offshore
leasing anywhere in the U.S.

By analyzing four different scenarios, we can see the impacts of no new
offshore leasing and new transportation policies on oil and gas
production, demand, and other outcomes. The [scenarios]{.underline} are
the following:

The reference scenario (Ref) includes business-as-usual offshore leasing
through 2050, and some transportation policies from the IRA, consistent
with the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook
2023 model.

The no new leasing (NNL) scenario assumes that no new offshore leases
are issued in the Gulf of Mexico after May 2021, and includes the same
transportation policies as the reference scenario.

The transportation policy (POL) scenario assumes business-as-usual
leasing through 2050. Unlike the Ref and NNL scenarios, it includes
additional IRA tax credits, new electric vehicle targets under the
Advanced Clean Trucks rule, and the EPA's proposed GHG standards for
cars and trucks.

The no new leasing plus transportation policy (NNL+POL) scenario assumes
that no new offshore leases are issued in the Gulf of Mexico after May
2021, and includes the same transportation policies as the
transportation policy (POL) scenario.

[There are several]{.underline} key [takeaways]{.underline} from the
results of OnLocation's analysis.

[Demand for oil is likely to drop under new transport]{.underline}ation
[policies.]{.underline}

In 2035, overall U.S. oil consumption is 10% lower in the scenarios that
reflect new [clean transportation policies]{.underline} (POL and
NNL+POL), compared with the straight business as usual (Ref) or straight
no new leasing (NNL) scenarios. Notably, demand for oil decreases even
with no new leasing in the Gulf.

By 2050, oil consumption is 19% lower in POL and NNL+POL than in the
other two scenarios. By [encouraging]{.underline} sales of [electric
vehicles]{.underline} [and]{.underline} hastening the transition to
[renewable]{.underline} [s]{.underline}ources of energy, the clean
transportation policies included in the third and fourth scenarios (POL
and NNL+POL) [drive a decreased demand for oil]{.underline}. The figure
below shows the difference in oil consumption from 2020 to 2050 in the
clean transportation policy scenarios (green and yellow lines) and the
reference and NNL scenarios (red and blue lines).

A line graph titled \"Total Oil/Liquid Fuel Consumption\"

Figure 1: U.S. oil demand from 2020 to 2050.Credit:OnLocation for NRDC

Even with no new leasing in the Gulf, U.S. oil production remains robust
through 2050.

Although no new leasing in the Gulf would reduce the number of new
offshore oil and gas leases issued, this policy would have only a mild
impact on U.S. oil production over the next 30 years.

As shown in Figure 2 below, even under the no new leasing scenario, U.S.
oil production tends to increase from 2020 to 2035.

Through 2040, annual production in the no new leasing scenario is higher
than 2024 production in both the NNL case and the reference case.

U.S. oil production remains robust through the entire period of
analysis. Projected production in the no new leasing scenario is still
higher in 2050 than it is in 2023.

This sustained production is due in part to the staggering number of
existing offshore leases: there are currently 559 producing offshore oil
and gas leases, in addition to 1,685 non-producing but active leases, in
federal waters. Moreover, offshore leases can continue to produce oil
and gas for decades.

analyzed.Credit:OnLocation for NRDC

Declines in U.S. oil production over time match the decreasing demand
for oil.

As described and shown in Figure 1 above, new transportation policies
are projected to drive down overall oil consumption by 10% in 2035 and
19% in 2050.

[As demand falls, oil production will also **decline**.]{.underline}
Over the analysis time period, new clean transportation policies will
drive down the price of crude oil, causing U.S. production to decrease.

## Link Answer

#### No link -- US electricity doesn't come from oil and it will only affect domestic production. 

**Ip '25** (Greg, Chief Economics Commentator, The Wall Street Journal,
"Economic Growth Now Depends on Electricity, Not Oil," March 27, 2025,
https://archive.is/Tn3b2#selection-2111.0-3153.90)

In coming years, though, [energy security will mean
**electricity**]{.underline}.

[Power demand,]{.underline} stagnant for decades, [is now growing
rapidly]{.underline}, for data centers to run artificial intelligence
and other digital services and, in time, transportation and buildings.

[An economy dependent on electricity will be different from one
dependent on oil.]{.underline} It will require mammoth investment in
generation, distribution and transmission. It will challenge regulators
and political leaders, as the supply and price of electricity become as
politically potent as that of gasoline.

You can see the imprint of the electric economy on the outskirts of
Gloucester, Va., where less than two years ago Dominion Energy, the
state's main utility, completed a 175-acre solar facility on what used
to be a tree nursery.

When Ross Millikan joined Dominion Energy's renewables unit in 2015, its
service area had no operating solar facilities. His staff of 80 now
oversees 58, including the Gloucester site.

"We used to think of ourselves as kind of a startup sitting in an old
utility," said Millikan, 38 years old, manager of Dominion's renewable
operations. "Now it's much more the bread and butter for us and the
company."

The heyday for electricity was the 1950s and 1960s, when appliances and
air conditioning fueled annual demand growth of about 8% a year,
according to Grid Strategies, a power-sector consulting firm.

By the 2000s, slowing population growth, a dearth of new technological
applications, and increased efficiency brought growth to under 1% a
year. But growth jumped to 3% last year and will continue at that rate
for the next five years, Grid Strategies projects.

The firm estimates that since 2022, utilities have raised expected peak
demand for summer 2029 by 12%, or 101 gigawatts. The drivers are data
centers for AI, cloud computing and cryptocurrency; new factories; and
the gradual adoption of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and hydrogen
production.

Dominion plans to double generation capacity over the next 15 years to
56 gigawatts, much of that to power Northern Virginia's "Data Center
Alley." Solar is expected to account for 45% of that, requiring the
construction of numerous new facilities every year.

[The U.S. and the world will need plenty of oil and gas for decades to
come]{.underline}, and the shale revolution has ensured that the U.S.
will be a dominant producer of both.

Solar panels and a substation at Dominion Energy\'s Gloucester, Va.,
facility. The company intends to double its generation capacity to help
power \'Data Center Alley\' in Northern Virginia.

[But they are becoming less important to the U**.S.'s domestic
needs**]{.underline}. [Consumption of petroleum liquids]{.underline}
(such as gasoline, jet fuel and heating oil) [has been flat for two
decades]{.underline}, and of natural gas---excluding gas used to
generate electricity---since 2018. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration expects petroleum and natural-gas consumption to grow
less than 1% a year for the next two years.

The meaning of energy security is changing

With oil, an interruption to supply in any part of the world could
ripple ashore in the U.S., even once it became a net exporter, which has
long influenced U.S. foreign and security policy.

**[Electricity comes from almost entirely domestic
sources]{.underline}**---[coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and
geothermal---insulating it from foreign influences or interruptions to
any single fuel source.]{.underline} At night, the electricity that no
longer flows from the solar panels in Gloucester comes from Dominion's
nuclear and gas plants and, in the future, batteries. "There's no single
power source that's going to reliably serve all of our customers," said
spokesman Aaron Ruby. "[We need nuclear, we need natural gas, we need
renewables."]{.underline}

The threats to electricity security are different: extreme weather and
other disasters; sharp fluctuations in demand, such as from
cryptocurrency mining; or weather that reduces solar and wind power.

### Warming Turns Stability

#### Climate migration [destabilizes]{.underline} the entire region -- [insurgent group recruitmen]{.underline}t and [rising populism]{.underline} ensues -- the aff is key to [long-term stability]{.underline}.

MMC

Although climate change's horrors are global---melting polar ice caps,
loss of wildlife habitats, and more frequent, more powerful natural
disasters like hurricanes, to name just a few---some regions bear a
higher burden than others. [This is especially true for forced migration
due to climate change, which, for regions like the Middle East, can be
particularly destabilizing.]{.underline} [Migration will be one of the
most adverse impacts of climate change on the region. How regional and
global actors act now and what they decide on in the next United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP) will determine the trajectory of
climate-induced migration in years ahead. As one of the world's hottest
regions, the [Middle East]{.mark} is [at high risk of
climate]{.mark}-related [migration]{.mark}. [Regional
temperatures]{.mark} have [risen twice as fast as]{.mark} the global
[average]{.mark}, and several studies have indicated that dry spells
throughout the region are projected to last beyond 2040. There are also
projections of decreased annual rainfall in some areas, and downpours in
others, leading to floods. In cities like Alexandria or Basra, [rising
sea levels]{.mark} will [cause coastal storms and flooding]{.mark} that
will [lead to]{.mark} human [displacement]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Also,
by 2060, agricultural sectors such as Egypt's are expected to decrease
by 47 percent, which will prompt rural communities to seek fertile land
for crops elsewhere.]{.underline} The region's leaders have responded
differently to this challenge. For example, Jordan turned to wealthier
states, including Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to finance
capital-intensive climate projects, including water desalination plants,
as well as solar power plants and hydroponics projects in the Jordanian
Zaatari refugee camps---the first of these projects created in a refugee
camp. These efforts by poorer states aim to mitigate the coming impacts
of climate change on already-vulnerable populations. [Conversely,
oil-rich member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have, in
theory at least, sought to move away from hydrocarbons and toward
renewable sources, which is one of the goals of Saudi Arabia Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030. [Even if Saudi]{.mark} Arabia
[accomplishes]{.mark} its [Vision 2030 goals]{.mark}, [it will still
face]{.mark} the [issues brought about by climate]{.mark}
change.]{.underline} Similarly, other non-GCC states, such as Morocco,
are attempting to reduce their carbon footprint by decreasing fossil
fuel imports and generating electricity from renewable energy. At the
end of 2022, Morocco's share of renewable energy for electricity stood
at 38 percent, with a goal of 52 percent by 2030. Furthermore, in
November 2021, COP 26 produced a series of goals to reduce greenhouse
emissions, and some Middle Eastern and North African countries updated
their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to meet the needs of
the Paris climate agreement. Some states, such as Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain, pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and the United
Arab Emirates (2050) pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
[[Without a concerted effort]{.mark} to mitigate the climate crisis,
[the region's population will suffer from a new refugee crisis]{.mark}
due to climate change. Furthermore, [the stress]{.mark} that another
wave of [refugees]{.mark}---this time induced by the climate
crisis---[will place on]{.mark} already [resource-poor countries]{.mark}
like Jordan [will be catastrophic]{.mark}.]{.underline} King Abdullah II
of Jordan has stated that Syrian refugees' homes are not in their host
countries, and until they can return, world leaders "must all do right
by them." King Abdullah's statement calls for the protection of refugees
until they can safely return home. Yet, this unforeseeable return
becomes unattainable when many of the refugees hosted by countries such
as Jordan come from countries at risk of climate disasters. Currently,
approximately 90 percent of the world's refugee populations originate
from climate-vulnerable populations. Thus, returning to their homes will
become more difficult. [Moreover, refugees have rights, but whether
Middle Eastern states can deliver on them in the midst of catastrophic
climate crises will become a challenge.]{.underline} For instance, the
facilitation of rights outlined by conventions such as the 1951 Refugee
Convention and the 1967 Protocol---which were the foundation for the
United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR)---will become more difficult as
states struggle to provide uniform support to migrants who flood their
borders in the coming years. Also, adopted in December 2018, the United
Nations Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) recognizes the increased
displacement resulting from climate disasters. The compact's
stakeholders pledged to ensure an equitable responsibility for displaced
peoples and in responding to future refugee crises. Ultimately, the
provision of necessities will exacerbate the challenges faced by host
countries that already struggle to assist the internally displaced and
refugee populations within their borders. [Given the interconnectedness
of the climate crisis with other issues across the region, the United
Nations deems it as a threat multiplier. The threats that already exist
will only worsen as time progresses, triggering other related and
unrelated calamities in the region.]{.underline} An example of a
multiplied threat occurred in Libya in September 2023. In Libya, Storm
Daniel ravaged the Mediterranean Sea and landed in Libya, causing two
dams to burst near Derna, a coastal city with a population of nearly
100,000. The aftermath left the city and its people devastated with
approximately 891 buildings destroyed. Other towns, such as Marj,
Al-Bayda, and Shahhat, flooded from the storm's heavy rain, and nearly
34,000 people from these cities were displaced. According to UNICEF,
more than 4,300 people died, and approximately 884,000 people across the
five provinces affected by the storm in northern Libya were impacted.
But, much like the climate-induced refugee crises elsewhere in the
region, this crisis only exacerbated and compounded an existing one.
Even before the storm, about 300,000 people in Libya required
humanitarian assistance. The tragic floods in Libya illustrate one of
the greatest challenges to addressing the climate crisis:
accountability. The dams located in Derna were part of wider issues
linked to Libya's weak public infrastructure, left unaddressed by the
leaders of the divided country. Libyans who mourned the loss of their
families demanded accountability and answers, and a response came from
the military dictator and warlord in the eastern part of Libya, Khalifa
Haftar. On the day Derna was struck by the catastrophe, Haftar's eldest
son, Elseddik, declared his candidacy for the Libyan presidency. By
leading the response to the catastrophe, Haftar and his family used the
disastrous floods to strengthen their power by gaining the support of
the Libyan masses who hoped their leaders would finally step up. The
climate-induced floods in Libya convey the poor infrastructure in place
to address climate disasters in the region and raise wider concerns of
accountability. [In countries already experiencing internal displacement
due to conflict like Yemen, the [warming]{.mark} climate also
[poses]{.mark} the [risk of increased recruitment to insurgency
groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Food insecurity may make alternative forms
of income from insurgency groups more attractive to displaced
communities because they can provide lucrative avenues for support in
times of need. For example, the [Houthis in Yemen]{.mark} have
reportedly [offered salaries and food baskets]{.mark} to the families of
soldiers they have recruited. As climate-displaced people continue to
relocate within their own countries or across borders, [populist
nationalism and factionalism]{.mark} may [arise]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Refugees]{.mark} can [make for easy scapegoats]{.mark} for a country's
problems, which could [lead to increased violence]{.mark} against these
new newcomers. For instance, in Lebanon, ministers and other government
officials have pushed narratives that blame the country's economic
malaise on Syrian refugees.]{.underline} The return of Syrian refugees
to Syria by Lebanese politicians such as Nadim Gemayel, has been framed
in hostile terms such as a "national necessity." The scapegoating of
refugees is not a new phenomenon---but the climate crisis will likely
worsen its effects. [As a threat multiplier, one that can both compound
and exacerbate existing catastrophes, the climate crisis needs a more
vigorous approach than regional leaders are taking.]{.underline} This
November\'s United Nations Climate Change Conference---COP 29---in
Azerbaijan this November will surely be an important setting for more
discussions of climate migration. But the current and future climate
refugees of the Middle East can't rely on yearly high-level talks alone.

Sustaining growth in private non-oil investment requires maintaining the
reform momentum and sound macroeconomic policies

[Saudi Arabia's economy is **undergoing** a transformation, as it
implements **reforms** to **reduce oil dependence**,]{.underline}
diversify income sources[, and enhance **competitiveness**]{.underline}.
[This year marks an important juncture]{.underline} as the midpoint of
Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 journey. As shown in the latest IMF
annual review of the country\'s economy, progress has been most notably
reflected in [non-oil growth, which has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since 2021, averaging 4.8 percent in 2022. Despite lower overall growth
reflecting additional oil production cuts, non-oil growth will remain
close to 5 percent in 2023, spurred by strong domestic demand.

[**Diversification** has been driven by **improvements** in the
**regulatory** and business environment.]{.underline} As a result of a
new set of laws to promote entrepreneurship, protect investors' rights,
and reduce the costs of doing business, [new **investment** deals and
licenses grew by 95 **percent** and 267 percent]{.underline} in 2022,
respectively. In addition, the Saudi Investment Fund ([PIF) has been
deploying capital, including to help stimulate **private** sector
**investment**.]{.underline}

Charting the course ahead

[The **econ**omy's non-oil growth has been **spurred** by strong
domestic **demand**, particularly private non-oil
investment.]{.underline} Sustaining this performance requires pursuing
sound macroeconomic policies and maintaining the reform momentum,
irrespective of developments in oil markets.

**Diversification is here now.**

[With **Saudi** Arabia's non-oil sector **reaching** 50% of GDP for the
**first time** last year, the Gulf nation marked a watershed in its
diversification from fossil fuel dependency.]{.underline} Government
data released last month shows t[he real GDP **growth** rate for
**non-oil** activities at about 4.4%,]{.underline} valuing the sector at
about 1.7 trillion Saudi riyals (around \$453 billion). This puts the
kingdom [on **course** to meet the objectives set out in **Vision**
2030]{.underline}, its broad program of policies and reforms, which
holds economic diversification as one of its core objectives. "The oil
and gas sector is highly capital intensive and does not create the flow
of job opportunities required to meet the supply of labor from a young
and increasingly educated population," says Nasser Saidi, an economist
and Lebanon's former minister of economy and trade, noting that around
30% of Saudi Arabia's population is below age 30. To meet the challenge,
the government has introduced incentives aimed at growing both services
and manufacturing. [As a result, much of the non-oil sector's **growth**
last year was **driven** by **private** consumption in areas like
**entertainment**, hospitality and tourism.]{.underline} Together, they
accounted for 40% of economic activity last year. The tourism sector,
which has attracted \$13 billion in private investments recently, has
been a particularly strong point, Saidi notes, luring 27 million foreign
visitors last year in addition to 77 million domestic travelers. These
achievements did not stop the kingdom from suffering a 4.3% year-on-year
decline in real GDP in 2023, however. The principal culprit was a drop
in oil sector activity caused by voluntary production cuts put in place
by the OPEC countries amid market concerns and rising output outside the
group. Moreover, the majority of Saudi wealth is still to be found below
ground, even when oil production is not considered. [**Mining** and
**quarrying** accounted for one-third of total non-oil **output** last
year.]{.underline} Outside of these sectors, manufacturing accounted for
more than 15% of real GDP, while real estate and construction
contributed 14%.

[[**Even as** oil]{.mark} production [cuts **eat** into Saudi
Arabia's]{.mark} top-line [GDP]{.mark}, the [country remains one of the
**most buoyant emerging markets**]{.mark} in 2024, [supported
by]{.mark}]{.underline} ongoing [growth in its burgeoning **[non-oil
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [country's]{.underline} social **[transformation]{.underline}** ---
which began in earnest eight years ago [with]{.underline} the launch of
the **[[Vision 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}** programme [by]{.underline}
Crown Prince **[M]{.underline}**ohammed **[b]{.underline}**in

the [[country's]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[growth
**beyond**]{.mark} its]{.underline} long-established [[hydrocarbon
sector]{.mark}, creating **jobs**]{.underline} for a rapidly expanding
local workforce.

Yet while **[[lower oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** and regional
geopolitical risks [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} had [**[little
impact]{.mark}** on non-oil business sentiment]{.underline} thus far,
questions remain about the capacity of the government to follow through
on a growing list of headline-grabbing gigaprojects --- to which the
Fifa World Cup of 2034 is expected to be added shortly --- especially as
it struggles to attract foreign direct investment.

After a surge in oil revenues following Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine made Saudi Arabia the best-performing economy in the G20 in
2022, last year saw the country sink close to the bottom of the table.
[Oil production cuts introduced in October 2022]{.underline} by Saudi
Arabia and the Opec+ bloc and deepened the following April [saw the
country's oil economy contract by **9 per cent** in
**2023**]{.underline}, prompting a 0.8 per cent fall in overall GDP.

The cuts --- aimed at shoring up prices amid weak global demand --- are
set to expire in June at time of writing, with production expected to
rise again to protect market share in the face of expanding US oil
production.

Yet while a similar move 10 years ago saw a dramatic production increase
and a slump in prices, more gradual action is expected this time around.

"When production rates increase we're unlikely to see the same sharp
rises that we saw in 2014, as Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ members
aren't going to want to see prices fall as far as they did then," says
James Swanston, a Middle East and north Africa economist at Capital
Economics.

Yet [[while Capital Economics]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[predicts]{.mark} a **4.5 per cent [contraction]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the **[oil economy]{.mark}**]{.underline} this year even as production
ramps up, [[**overall GDP** is forecast to improve]{.mark} to 2.8 per
cent [on the back of]{.mark} the country's **burgeoning [non-oil
economy]{.mark}**. The sector grew by 4.4 per cent in 2023]{.underline},
with Capital Economics forecasting 4.8 per cent growth this year.

Vision becoming reality

The story of the transformation of Saudi Arabia's non-oil economy under
Vision 2030 is by now a familiar one. Its milestones --- the lifting of
the ban on cinemas and women drivers, the sale of shares in state oil
company Saudi Aramco, the launch of several domestic gigaprojects,
[[heavy state investment in **economic
diversification**]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives and the dramatic rise
in domestic employment --- [are]{.underline} still [worthy of
note]{.underline}.

[Saudi Arabia]{.underline} is trying, with mixed success, to recast
itself on the international stage. The kingdom, whose gross domestic
product reached \$1 trillion in 2022 for the first time, wants an
economy that can keep pace with the global energy transition and a
foreign policy that is less reliant on the United States. [Saudi
policies are]{.underline} [shaped by]{.underline} the ambitions of its
de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly known as
[MBS]{.underline}), [to consolidate his hold on power,]{.underline} make
the country less dependent on hydrocarbon exports and transform the
kingdom into a significant middle power -- one that pursues its
interests by increasing its regional and global influence and broadening
its external ties[.]{.underline} As it works toward these goals, [Riyadh
is increasingly placing itself at the centre of high-stakes
diplomacy]{.underline} and mediation efforts. Yet unless Riyadh makes
further changes, its apparent efforts at self-transformation are likely
to hit a ceiling that falls short of its hopes.

Saudi Vision 2030

One way to understand many of Saudi Arabia's recent policy innovations
is through the lens of Saudi Vision 2030, the crown prince's flagship
development initiative launched in 2016. MBS announced his new strategy
soon after his father came to power in 2015 and named him deputy crown
prince, head of the newly created Council of Development and Economic
Affairs and minister of defence. Today, MBS is both crown prince and
prime minister. His success as a leader -- at least during the present
period -- is being judged in large part by his ability to see Saudi
Vision 2030 to fruition.

The central goal of [Saudi Vision 2030]{.underline} is to [better
position Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [to weather the]{.underline} global
[transition to clean energy through]{.underline} economic
[diversification.]{.underline} The realisation that the country must
reduce its dependence on hydrocarbon sales is not new -- oil makes up 74
per cent of all exports -- but the urgency has grown acute after the
global economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, when oil prices fell
to record lows. The diversification mindset has persisted even following
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed global energy prices to new
highs, leading to record profits in 2022 for Saudi Aramco, the state oil
company. Saudi officials argued to Crisis Group that while they saw the
price spike as a final opportunity to reap benefits from the country's
hydrocarbon wealth, efforts to transform the economy continue.

[Riyadh is]{.underline} therefore [significantly expanding its non-oil
econom]{.underline}ic activit[y]{.underline}. It plans to do so
[by]{.underline}, for example, [bolstering]{.underline} religious and
non-religious [tourism]{.underline}. It hopes to [attract foreign
residents]{.underline} and capital through mega-projects like Neom
Line[,]{.underline} a linear city no more than 200m across that will
stretch for 170km along the Red Sea coast, run on renewable energy and
accommodate nine million people. Vision 2030 will also draw on Saudi
Arabia's \$700 billion sovereign wealth fund to make unprecedented
investments in developing non-oil sectors, such as [renewable energy,
sports]{.underline} and entertainment, [and a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence. In this vein, Saudi Arabia intends to
develop its own professional football league by acquiring superstars
such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Neymar, as well as
investing in competitive athletics abroad, including billions devoted to
football, golf, mixed martial arts and various other sports.

To back up his economic diversification plans, the crown prince has
started to open up Saudi Arabia's conservative society, but only in some
respects. As commentators have noted, the reforms are tightly focused on
the social and cultural domain. In that space, MBS is projecting a more
tolerant version of Sunni Islam to replace rigid adherence to its
Wahhabi variety, which is rooted in literalist interpretations of
Islam's most sacred texts. He is also spearheading religious and labour
reforms that aim to give more rights to women in particular. These
include removing the infamous religious police that monitored strict
adherence to religious doctrine; allowing women to drive; and dropping
the requirement that women seek a guardian's approval for work or
travel.

When it comes to political rights, however, the situation remains grim.
[MBS has maintained an absolute monarchy, ruling with an iron fist and
leaving no space for]{.underline} [dissent]{.underline}ing political
views. Saudi Arabian [citizens face arrest for social media posts that
mildly criticise government policie]{.underline}s[.]{.underline} In a
prominent recent case, Saudi authorities sentenced to death a retired
teacher (and the brother of a dissident living in exile in the UK),
Mohamed Elghamdi, for calling out corruption to his dozen or so
followers. This punishment is the most severe they have handed down for
social media activity. Other citizens who have used such platforms to
voice disapproval of government policies have received long prison
terms, ranging between twenty and 45 years.

While MBS has released some high-profile women activists who were jailed
for promoting women's right to drive, others have been detained since,
with dozens of them remaining under house arrest and unable to leave the
country. [He has]{.underline} not only [targeted]{.underline} civil
society and everyday [citizens who dare to speak]{.underline} up, [but
also]{.underline} people in [the]{.underline} powerful Saudi political
and economic [elite]{.underline}, including members of the royal family.
In 2017, he launched a so-called anti-corruption campaign, [arresting
hundreds of princes, business leaders and]{.underline} othe[r prominent
personalities]{.underline}, reportedly forcing them to hand over their
fortunes in an apparent bid [to eliminate potential opponents of his
rule.]{.underline}

While there is no doubt that falling revenues present oil regimes with
serious problems, the evidence indicates that [these [regimes]{.mark}
are much more likely to be able to]{.underline}
**[[weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[periods of
[low]{.mark}]{.underline}**er **[[revenue]{.mark}s]{.underline}** than
the memorable examples cited above might indicate. Benjamin
[Smith]{.underline}, [in [a **longitudinal study**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[of oil-dependent regimes [over **four
decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[finds]{.mark} that such [regimes
are]{.mark} **more** **[stable]{.mark}** than their non-oil
counterparts, **including**]{.underline} [[during]{.mark} periods of
**[low]{.mark}er [prices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Other **quantitative
studies** come to similar conclusions]{.underline}.6 **[[Every]{.mark}
Middle Eastern [oil regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[survived]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} great oil [crash of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
mid-19[80's]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even the Algerian generals kept their
system together]{.underline}, although at a terrible human cost.
Conversely, **[neither]{.underline}** [the Iranian
Revolution]{.underline} **[nor]{.underline}** [the massive "Green
Movement" social mobilization in Iran in 2009 occurred during dramatic
decreases in oil prices]{.underline}.7 Moammar [Gaddafi was **ousted**

[when oil [prices were at **historic highs**]{.mark}, after
**surviving** the low oil price periods of the 1980s and
1990s.]{.underline}

[[It is]{.mark} therefore **[unlikely]{.mark}** that the current oil
price [decline will **destabilize**]{.mark} **Middle East
[regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [Gulf monarchies, with]{.mark}
their relatively [**small populations** and **massive financial
reserves**, are]{.mark} **likely** to be the **[least
affected]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even [Bahrain and Oman]{.underline},
with much less oil and gas per capita than Kuwait, Qatar, and the United
Arab Emirates, can [rely on the financial and political support of their
**GCC partners**]{.underline}, as they did during the upheaval of 2011.
In the face of the oil price collapse, the new king Salman of Saudi
Arabia in January 2015 granted his subjects a bonus equivalent to two
months of their government salaries, costing his treasury over \$30
billion.8 But [[with]{.mark} over \$[**700 billion** in the
bank]{.mark}, the [Saudi]{.mark} state [can]{.mark} afford to **[spend
more than it takes in]{.mark}** for some time. This is exactly what
Riyadh did to cope with shrinking revenue in the 1980s and 1990s. It ran
**significant government budget deficits**]{.underline}, covered at
first from government reserves and then from domestic borrowing, [until
oil prices went up again in the **2000s**.]{.underline}

in [**[renewable energy]{.mark}**. A comprehensive **study** of

**[lowest]{.mark}**]{.underline} carbon [**[emissions]{.mark}** per

in energy intensity]{.underline} of its industrial facilities [via
energy **efficiency** and carbon management technologies. It has
invested in a]{.underline} master gas [system to reduce]{.underline}
natural [gas flaring]{.underline} to less than 1 per cent of gas
production [and is adding **renewable energy**]{.underline} to power
remote sites such as the Turaif oil storage facility. [[Saudi]{.mark}
Aramco has also [begun]{.mark} to [invest]{.mark}]{.underline} heavily
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon capture and storage [(**[CCS]{.mark}**)
to position itself to be]{.underline} the [lowest cost]{.underline},
lowest carbon source of oil in the coming decades in an effort [to be
the most competitive source for oil [as]{.mark} market [demand
shrinks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Saudi Aramco launched the first
large-scale CCS facility in the Middle East which is a C02-EOR
demonstration project that captures roughly 0.8 million tons of carbon a
year from the Hawiyah natural gas liquids recovery plant. [Saudi Aramco
is also investing \$5 billion to produce 10 GW of power from **renewable
energy**]{.underline} by 2023. The state firm also has a research
facility in Detroit which is studying direct capture technologies for
C02 including from vehicle tailpipes.
