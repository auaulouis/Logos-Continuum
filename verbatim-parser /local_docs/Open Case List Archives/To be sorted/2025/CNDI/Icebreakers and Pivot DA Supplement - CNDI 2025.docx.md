**[There is much debate among the media and the scientific community
regarding [developing]{.mark} Arctic Shipping Routes
([ASRs]{.mark}).]{.underline}** The maritime industry has been somewhat
reluctant to develop these routes, **[leading Russia to attempt to [set
up a new business model with transhipment]{.mark}]{.underline}** hubs to
attract cargo despite the low interest among shipping companies for
transit (Lasserre & Cyr, Citation2022). These endeavors have paved the
way for the evolution of ASRs, pictorially captured in Figure 1. Figure
1 provides an overview of ASRs, which typically comprise three main
shipping lanes: the Northern Sea Route (NSR), the Northwest Passage
(NWP), and the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR). The NWP is the sea lane
between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans via the Arctic Ocean, along the
northern coast of North America via waterways through the Arctic
Archipelago of Canada. **[Conversely, the NSR, governed by Russia, is
the shortest shipping route between the Asia-Pacific region and the
western part of Eurasia, [supported by continuous investment in
icebreakers]{.mark} and natural resources terminals like Sabetta, Arctic
Gate, and the future terminals near Dickson (Melia et al.,
Citation2016).]{.underline}** Compared to the NSR, the NWP accounts for
only a small portion of international trade due to its lack of
predictability (Fu et al., Citation2021). Utilizing the NWP requires
additional maritime infrastructure and deep-water ports capable of
accommodating large vessels, contrasting the predominantly rural
villages along its route. The surge in Arctic traffic volume can be
primarily attributed to coal transportation, liquefied natural gas,
crude oil, and ongoing exploration of natural resources in the Russian
Arctic. The cargo volume of the NSR has significantly grown from 10.7
million tons in 2017--31.5 million tons in 2022 (Erokhin et al.,
Citation2022; Li et al., Citation2021). The Transpolar Sea Route (TSR),
often referred to as the 'Silk Road on Ice' (Guo et al., Citation2022),
has garnered significant global and domestic attention. Although still a
hypothetical route, it is considered a viable alternative through the
Arctic region, with comprehensive development expected after the NWP and
the NSR (Boylan, Citation2021). **[[Due to the reduction and diminishing
thickness of Arctic sea ice, it is anticipated that ships without
ice-class capabilities can travers]{.mark}e the NSR and NWP [before
2050]{.mark} (Chen et al., Citation2021; Lau et al., Citation2023;
Prentice et al., Citation2021).]{.underline}** By the end of the
twenty-first century, the NWP may be without ice cover for two to four
months, while the NSR could remain ice-free for three to six months.
Despite the potential, the development of ASRs faces several challenges.
The profitability of ASRs is often questioned due to unpredictability
associated with political, economic, and technical instabilities and
various hazards (Afenyo et al., Citation2017). [**However, some
[research indicates benefits such as enhanced accessibility, reduced
transit times, improved network connectivity, lower greenhouse gas
emissions, and reduced operational costs]{.mark} (**Chen et al.,
Citation2021; Lasserre et al., Citation2016; Theocharis et al.,
Citation2018).]{.underline} There is also a need to examine the effects
of pollution in the Arctic region, with studies forecasting emissions
trends and possible sea ice conditions in various scenarios (Peters et
al., Citation2011; Winther et al., Citation2014).

### Inherency

#### Current Coast Guard operations already require six more Icebreakers

**Polefka '15** \[Shiva Polefka, Program Officer for Ocean, Coast, and
Fisheries at Resources Legacy Fund. March 5, 2015. "Icebreakers:
Essential Assets for a Changing Arctic", American Progress,
<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/icebreakers-essential-assets-for-a-changing-arctic/>\]
OD

[According to a congressionally ordered independent analysis, 9 of the
Coast Guard's 11 statutorily mandated missions are now relevant to the
rapidly thawing Arctic.]{.underline} These essential duties include
enforcing fishing and maritime safety laws, maintaining defense
readiness, and conducting search and rescue for mariners in distress.
The Coast Guard is also responsible for emergency response to offshore
oil spills, [a particularly crucial function as the U.S. Department of
the Interior prepares for new Arctic oil lease sales in 2020 and 2022
and as Royal Dutch Shell continues its pursuit of year-round, offshore
oil and gas production in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. In other words,
the Coast Guard must be able to conduct operations in Arctic waters in
order to uphold its duties as both a military service and the foremost
maritime law enforcement entity]{.underline}. The paradox of the global
warming-driven thaw of the Arctic is that the retreat of permanent sea
ice is actually making Arctic navigation riskier, even as overall
accessibility increases. Before perennial sea ice began its steady
retreat in the early 1980s, it shielded Arctic waters from wind and
reduced the volatility of seasonal ice formation. Today, winter sea ice
now forms and recedes over a much larger proportion of the Arctic Ocean.
In addition, loose icebergs and pack ice can be quickly transported long
distances and jam into thick ridges and treacherous, hull-crushing floes
by wind and currents, especially in the spring and fall. [[To safely and
effectively carry out]{.mark} its diverse [missions in the
Arctic]{.mark} year round, [the Coast Guard must be]{.mark} properly
[equipped with]{.mark} specialized ships built with the powerful
engines, structural reinforcement, and nearly two-inch thick steel hulls
needed to withstand and break through even the thickest sea ice during
the heart of the polar winter. Such ships, known as [heavy
icebreakers]{.mark}, are also large enough to accommodate aircraft,
large crews of sailors, scientists and other personnel, as well as the
storage of adequate fuel, supplies, and equipment required for
self-supported polar missions and unaided journeys to and from the polar
regions. [Today]{.mark}, however, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[only has one functional heavy icebreaker remaining]{.mark}---the U.S.
Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star---[and it's on its last
legs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Commissioned in 1976 and originally slated
for a 30-year service life, Congress provided about \$57 million in
fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for major repairs to the ship, which
facilitated a successful re-launch in 2012[. The Coast Guard now expects
the ship to function until around 2020, after which the United States
will not have heavy icebreaking capability. Polar Star's sister ship,
Polar Sea---commissioned in 1977---currently sits disabled and docked in
the Port of Seattle, inoperable since a major engine failure in
2010.]{.underline} Legislation signed by President Obama in December
2014 requires that the Coast Guard evaluate options for Polar Sea and
decide to either decommission or attempt to rehabilitate the vessel.
However, should the latter option even prove to be feasible, a short
extension of its service life similar to that of Polar Star seems like
the best potential outcome. [[After this]{.mark} extension, [the
U.S.]{.mark} government [would]{.mark} again [not possess the capability
for year-round operations in the Arctic]{.mark}. According to the
Congressional Research Service, the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, or DHS, made this predicament perfectly clear in its 2013
Mission Need Statement, in which it explained: \[C\]urrent requirements
and future projections...indicate [the Coast Guard will need]{.mark} to
expand its icebreaking capacity, potentially requiring a fleet of up to
[six icebreakers]{.mark} (3 heavy and 3 medium) [to adequately meet
mission demands]{.mark} in the high latitudes.]{.underline}

### ! - Russian Arctic War 

#### Russia's Arctic expansion causes intervention and war\-\--extinction.

**Geri 24** \[Maurizio Geri, former analyst for different NATO bodies in
the United States (Allied Command Transformation), Italy (Centre for
Maritime Research and Exploration and Joint Force Command Naples), and
Brussels (alliance headquarters).\"West's coming war with Russia will be
triggered by Arctic climate breakdown,\" Euractiv, October 1, 2024

\]\[abhi\]

[Over the next two decades]{.underline}, as climate change drives the
retreat of sea ice in the Arctic, [**[the probability of a Russian
invasion to dominate the region]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- which contains
some of the world's largest untapped mineral and fossil fuel resources
[-- **[will dramatically increase.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[**Such an
Arctic invasion** **would**]{.mark} **force NATO to act**, likely
**[lead]{.mark}ing [to a major global conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Currently, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn the most scrutiny as
an entry point for a broader assault on Europe. Yet politicians are
failing to join the dots adequately.

Focusing on the war in Ukraine and the need to recruit citizen armies is
a band-aid for a devastating global conflict scenario that could be
avoided. That means grappling with the biggest enemy of all.

NATO has long recognised how climate change is a 'threat amplifier' for
traditional security issues. Several NATO studies have warned that with
the climate changing faster than previously thought, the danger of a
military confrontation in the Arctic is rapidly increasing.

[With the Arctic's abundant natural resources]{.underline}, its ideal
strategic location and its tremendous potential to open up new rapid
routes for maritime trade, **[[Russia is hell-bent on controlling the
region.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**As** worsening **climate change is melting more ice in the Arctic,
sea routes**]{.underline} and new opportunities for exploration and
resource extraction [**have opened** up]{.underline}. The accelerating
[**[Arctic melt has increased Russia\'s]{.mark}**]{.underline} military
footprint and [geopolitical **[influence across the
region.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[**[Putin sees Russia's domination of the Arctic as critical to
the]{.mark}** economic **[survival of his regime]{.mark}**]{.underline}
over the next 30 years. [**The** Russian **Arctic**]{.underline} is
believed [to **hold up** to **95% of Russian gas** reserves **and 60% of
Russian oil** reserves, **yet unexplored**.]{.underline}

Yet, in a situation of mounting Western sanctions and international
isolation, opening up access to Arctic resources -- which are also
partially claimed by other NATO powers -- could trigger a scramble for
territorial domination.

[**[Any large-scale]{.mark} military** **[operation by Russia to capture
the Arctic]{.mark} would [trigger an unprecedented confrontation with
NATO]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} And that could light the powder
keg.

#### U.S. Russia War is immediate and would trigger nuclear winter.

[[34.1 million]{.mark} people]{.underline} [[could]{.underline}
[die]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and]{.underline} [another 57.4
million]{.underline} [could be]{.underline} [injured, [within the first
few hours of]{.mark}]{.underline} [the start of]{.underline} [[a nuclear
war between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited]{.underline}
[States]{.underline} [triggered by one low-yield nuclear
weapon,]{.underline} according to a new simulation by researcher's at
Princeton's Science and Global Security programme.

But that's not [all.]{.underline} [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
[overall]{.underline} [[death toll would]{.underline}
[be]{.underline}]{.mark} [even]{.underline} [[higher due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} long-term consequences of a nuclear war,
including radioactive fallout and [[global cooling]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the Earth's atmosphere, researchers add. Even a limited nuclear
exchange between India and Pakistan could put one billion people at risk
of starvation and another 1.3 billion at risk of severe food insecurity
due to global cooling, according to a 2013 study by International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Princeton simulation]{.mark},]{.underline}
ironically entitled "Plan A," comes as the United States works to
develop brand new low-yield nuclear weapons, despite the opposition of
leading Democratic members of Congress, and demonstrates that even
lower-yield nuclear weapons can have devastating consequences.

[The]{.underline} [[researchers used]{.underline}]{.mark}
[independent]{.underline} [[assessments of current U.S. and
Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear force postures, including the
number of]{.underline} [[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}
[deployed]{.underline} [[and their yields]{.underline}]{.mark}, war
plans and targets to create the simulation.

Equally alarming as the casualty toll of this nuclear war simulation is
the growing probability that it becomes a reality.

"[[The risk of nuclear war has increased
dramatically]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the past two years]{.underline}
[[as the U]{.mark}nited]{.underline} [[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [[and
Russia have abandoned]{.mark} long-standing]{.underline} [[nuclear arms
control treaties, started to develop new]{.underline}]{.mark} [kinds
of]{.underline} [[nuclear weapon]{.underline}s]{.mark} and expanded the
circumstances in which they might use nuclear weapons," wrote the
Princeton researchers on the project website.

### ! -- RCA Arctic War

#### **RCA activity in Arctic now poses nuclear threat**

**Choi '25** \[Seong Hyeon Choi, bachelor of journalism and master of
international and public affairs from the University of Hong Kong,
1/22/2025, "China, Russia's growing Arctic presence underpins Trump's
Greenland musings," South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3295590/china-russias-growing-arctic-presence-underpins-trumps-greenland-musings\]
\[bm\]

Situated between the Arctic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, Greenland
has been geopolitically significant to the US and its Nato allies since
the Cold War, as a crucial defence against missile attacks and submarine
operations. Melting sea ice as a result of climate change is adding to
the strategic importance of the Arctic Sea, where emerging shipping
routes are set to become the shortest distances between the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans. "Trump may be seeing direct control over Greenland as
an ideal way of ensuring that these corridors are being more effectively
watched and would act as a deterrent for future Sino-Russian military
activities in the Atlantic-Arctic region," Lanteigne said. "Greenland's
future political status is under debate, as there is great support there
for eventual independence but also the possibility of free association
with Denmark or the US, and the possibility of defence cooperation with
Nato." Greenland already hosts a US Space Force base at Pituffik, in the
northern part of the island, which has an early warning system designed
to detect and track intercontinental ballistic missiles
([[ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}). These long-range weapons are typically
designed to carry nuclear warheads across ranges longer than 5,500km
(3,420 miles) -- which means they [[could potentially pass over Arctic
airspace]{.underline}]{.mark} if they were heading [[towards the US
mainland]{.underline}]{.mark}. Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the
Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that while the Pituffik base
plays a key role in missile early warning and space surveillance, it
does not have ground-based missile interceptors or a "direct missile
defence role". "[With both Moscow and Beijing expanding and modernising
their nuclear weapons capabilities ... there's a strong argument to
expand US missile defences to counter this threat, alongside traditional
deterrence measures]{.underline}," he said. According to Davis, the
Trump team was "already promoting an expansion of US ballistic missile
defence capabilities", recognising that the current national missile
defence system was not capable of defending against a large missile
attack. "Greenland will become even more important in terms of its
current role in missile early warning, and an argument could be made
that it needs to be defended using ground-based missile defence
systems," he said. [[China and Russia have each ramped
up]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[ICBM development
programmes]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the Chinese People's Liberation
Army conducting its first test launch in 44 years in September. [[The
PLA's]{.underline}]{.mark} DF-31AG [[ICBM,]{.underline}]{.mark} which
landed in the Pacific Ocean near French Polynesia during the test,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[range]{.underline}]{.mark} of up to
13,200km (8,200 miles) -- enough [[to reach the entire US mainland. The
Arctic would be the shortest route]{.underline}]{.mark} for a Chinese
ICBM targeting the US mainland, with Greenland's airspace a potential
path for an attack on the east coast of America. According to a Pentagon
report on China's military development that was published in December,
China has 400 ICBMs and "probably completed" construction of three
solid-propellant silo fields in 2022. The report estimated that China's
nuclear stockpile surpassed 600 operational warheads in mid-2024 and
would reach more than 1,000 by 2030, with most of them "deployed at
higher readiness levels". Meanwhile, Russia's commander of strategic
missile forces Sergei Karakayev confirmed for the first time in December
that his country is developing a new ICBM system, the Osina. [The
[missile developments have coincided with the growing cooperation
between Beijing and Moscow]{.mark} to develop the northern sea route
along Russia's Arctic coastline, where the volume of Chinese shipping
has also been on the rise.]{.underline} Beijing outlined its plans to
play a growing role in the far north in a 2018 white paper which
described China as a "near-Arctic state". In April 2023, China and
Russia signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen maritime security
cooperation in the Arctic between their coastguards, with the first
joint maritime patrol occurring in October. In July, the North American
Aerospace Defence Command (**[[Norad]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[intercepted two Chinese and two Russian nuclear-capable bombers
flying near Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while the US coastguard
spotted four Chinese military vessels sailing near the Aleutian Islands.
Despite China's increasing presence in the far north, neither Denmark
nor Greenland is part of Norad, which is jointly operated by the US and
Canada to provide advance warning and protection of the airspace over
North America. The absence of Denmark and Greenland from the Norad
framework opens up a critical gap in the defences of the continent in
the northeastern corridor, observers said. Liselotte Odgaard, a senior
fellow at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, described
the nuclear threat towards the US mainland via the Arctic as "serious".
Missiles could travel across "insufficiently surveilled Greenlandic
airspace" while **[[the less scrutinised Arctic waters could
hide]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia's ballistic **[[missile
submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}** (SSBN), she said. "Since there is also
low visibility in that area, **[[it lowers the US' chance of
intercepting such a missile in time]{.underline}]{.mark}**." According
to Odgaard, the Pituffik base alone is "not enough" so long as the other
Arctic Nato member states, such as Denmark and Norway, do not have
ice-strengthened warships with anti-submarine capabilities. "Better
underwater surveillance along Greenland's east coast and between
Svalbard and Scandinavia is needed, since these Russian submarines pass
through these areas. Indeed they can hide under the floating ice along
east Greenland's coastline," she said.

where all countries are free from coercion and [**strongly oppose** any
**unilateral action**s that seek to change the **status quo**]{.mark} by
force or coercion. We discussed the opportunities and challenges in the

regional partners. [To ensure]{.mark} the Quad's enduring impact, we are
pleased to announce today a new, ambitious, and strong agenda focused on
four key areas: maritime and transnational security, economic prosperity

[we will sharpen]{.mark} the Quad's [ability]{.mark} to leverage our

challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} As we advance our shared objectives for
the region, our cooperation with and support for ASEAN and its
centrality and unity, the Pacific Islands Forum and Pacific-led regional
groupings, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) remain
unwavering. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the
East China Sea and South China Sea. We reiterate our strong opposition
to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or
coercion. We express our serious concerns regarding dangerous and
provocative actions, including interference with offshore resource
development, the repeated obstruction of the freedoms of navigation and
overflight, and the dangerous maneuvers by military aircraft and coast
guard and maritime militia vessels, especially the unsafe use of water
cannons and ramming or blocking actions in the South China Sea. These
actions threaten peace and stability in the region. We are seriously
concerned by the militarization of disputed features. We emphasize the
importance of upholding freedom of navigation and overflight, other
lawful uses of the sea, and unimpeded commerce consistent with
international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We affirm that maritime disputes must be
resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, and
reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12,
2016 is a significant milestone and the basis for peacefully resolving
disputes between the parties. We are deeply concerned about the abrupt
constriction and future reliability of key supply chains, specifically
for critical minerals. This includes the use of non-market policies and
practices for critical minerals, certain derivative products, and
mineral processing technology. We underscore the importance of
diversified and reliable global supply chains. Reliance on any one
country for processing and refining critical minerals and derivative
goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price
manipulation, and supply chain disruptions, which further harms our
economic and national security. We condemn North Korea's destabilizing
launches using ballistic missile technology and its continued pursuit of
nuclear weapons in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions
(UNSCRs). We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula consistent with relevant UNSCRs, and we urge North
Korea to abide by all its obligations under the UNSCRs. We also express
grave concern over North Korea's malicious cyber activity, including
cryptocurrency theft and use of workers abroad to fund North Korea's
unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. We
will continue to support efforts to address contraventions of North
Korea-related UNSCRs. We urge all UN Member States to abide by their
international obligations under the UNSCRs to implement sanctions,
including the prohibition on the transfer to North Korea or procurement
from North Korea of all arms and related materiel. We express deep
concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with
North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation
regime. We reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the
abductions issue. We remain deeply concerned by the worsening crisis in
Myanmar and its impact on the region. We call on the regime to adhere to
its commitment to a ceasefire, and call on all parties to implement,
extend and broaden ceasefire measures. We reaffirm our strong support
for ASEAN's efforts, including calling for the full and effective
implementation of the Five Point Consensus in seeking an inclusive,
durable, and peaceful resolution to the crisis. We call on all parties
to allow safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance. We are
also concerned about the impact of the crisis on regional security and
the spread of transnational crimes. We are committed to fighting
cybercrime and online scam operations. The Quad unequivocally condemns
all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and
manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, and renews our
commitment to counterterrorism cooperation. We condemn in the strongest
terms the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22,
2025, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali
citizen, while injuring several others. We express our deepest
condolences to the families of the victims and extend our heartfelt
wishes for a swift and full recovery to all those injured. We call for
the perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act
to be brought to justice without any delay and urge all UN Member
States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and
relevant UNSCRs, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in
this regard. In the face of these challenges, we are proud to announce
today key [initiatives that the Quad is [advancing to strengthen]{.mark}
maritime and transnational security, economic prosperity and security,
critical and emerging technology, and support humanitarian assistance
and emergency response [across the Indo-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline} We
are launching today the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative, an ambitious
expansion of our partnership to strengthen economic security and
collective resilience by collaborating to secure and diversify critical
minerals supply chains. We continue to deepen our cooperation on
maritime law enforcement cooperation through regional training
initiatives, maritime legal dialogues, and Coast Guard cooperation. We
plan to host the first Quad Indo-Pacific Logistics Network field
training exercise this year to strengthen shared airlift capacity and
leverage our collective logistics strengths to respond to natural
disasters more rapidly and efficiently, providing support for regional
partners. We also plan to launch the Quad Ports of the Future
Partnership in Mumbai this year. We continue to coordinate rapid
responses to regional disasters and collectively contributed over USD
\$30 million in humanitarian assistance to support communities affected
by the earthquake that struck central Myanmar in March 2025. We will
continue to counter foreign efforts to push false narratives and
interfere with Quad interests in the Indo-Pacific. As the Quad continues
to evolve, [[our]{.mark} four [democracies remain **committed to

Lowell PYS

US military exercises in Southeast Asia in the first half of 2025 have
shown a shift in strategy to respond to security challenges under
President Donald Trump's second term. Although the [[Trump]{.mark}
2]{.underline}.0 [[admin]{.mark}istration [has not
changed]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[goal]{.mark} of making [competition
with China in]{.mark} the [Indo-Pacific the highest
priority]{.mark}]{.underline}, Trump 2.0 has a different approach than
Trump 1.0 of nearly a decade ago. Through the recent 22nd Shangri-La
Dialogue, the [[Trump]{.mark} 2.0 administration [has openly promoted
a]{.mark} new force-building method that is more focused on
[developments]{.mark} on the ground [and]{.mark} has a more specific
[deterrence]{.mark} goal than the first term]{.underline}. Tactical
combat assets with long attack ranges, such as HIMARS missiles,
Navy-Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction Systems (NMESIS), or
Typhon systems, have been deployed more densely in recent exercises,
along with increased combat training content along with amphibious
operations and island control scenarios. [This suggests that the [US
presence]{.mark} in Southeast Asia [will likely include]{.mark} the
[establishment of garrisons]{.mark} on islands near the South China
Sea.]{.underline} The goal is not only to demonstrate commitment to
allies but also to test capabilities in the context of potential
conflicts. Evidence of this is the Balikatan 2025 exercise. In contrast
to Balikatan in 2017 [under Trump 1.0, which was aimed at logistics and
humanitarian relief]{.underline}, Balikatan 2025 is the largest,
featuring real-world firepower and the participation of many partners
outside the region[. This is a shift from "risk prevention" to
"deterrence,"]{.underline} reflecting a change not only in the approach
to new military exercises but also in the preemptive thinking of hawkish
security officials in the White House. [In short, [military
exercises]{.mark} in Southeast Asia under Trump 2.0 have become a
clearly oriented strategic tool with a real deterrent goal, serving to
reshape the military balance in the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}.
This is a departure from the Trump 1.0 term and shows the formation of a
strategy in which military presence and action capabilities are
prioritized over traditional alliance models. ***Is an Indo-Pacific
Strategy 2.0 in the Making?*** Before and during this year's Shangri-La
Dialogue, new US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered two keynote
speeches that marked the first Trump 2.0 policy statement for the
Indo-Pacific region. [Hegseth's speech seemed to reveal a [more robust
US approach to the regional security architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Trump administration is currently busy dealing with conflict
hotspots, but a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy 2.0 (FOIP 2.0)
document may be released in 2026. However, some pillars of this new
strategy will change significantly, reflecting a shift in how the US
shapes its role and presence in the region. The Trump 2.0 administration
is expected to maintain the principle of "Peace Through Strength," while
reducing extensive commitments to multilateral or sub-multilateral
mechanisms, focusing on strengthening bilateral relations with each
important partner. First, the FOIP 2.0 strategy still aims to narrow
China's space for action, especially in the context of the country's
increasing military and political activities in areas such as the East
Sea and the Taiwan Strait. To achieve this goal, the US has adjusted its
alliance methods to enhance combat capabilities with key partners. While
previous freedom of navigation patrols (FONOPs) were only meant to
demonstrate strength and create political pressure, under Trump 2.0, the
US has gradually reduced symbolic activities, instead focusing on
developing combat capabilities and the ability to deploy quickly, ready
for real-life scenarios. Typically, large-scale, highly practical
exercises such as Balikatan 2025 in the Philippines demonstrate
preparation for possible conflict situations. At the same time, the
deployment and training of Philippine soldiers to use the Typhon
medium-range missile system from 2024 has contributed to building tight
defense capabilities and enhancing deterrence. Second, in addition to
traditional exercises, FOIP 2.0 is expected to expand the form of
military presence through more flexible measures. One of the important
plans is to deploy a short-term military presence instead of building
fixed bases. The US will establish a rotational military presence in key
locations, which will control financial resources, reduce the risk of
political confrontation, and maintain rapid response capabilities.
Flexible tactical training activities and intensive exchanges such as
the Combat Casualty Care Exchange program in the Philippines or the
Tiger Balm 2025 exercise in Singapore have shown that this form of
deployment is designed to increase short-term presence. Third, FOIP 2.0
will not pursue a binding political alliance system but rather a more
flexible partnership, with partner countries cooperating on a
sector-specific basis and with a flexible level of commitment. This
model allows the United States to adjust quickly to each country's
political and security situation while reducing the legal and political
burdens associated with traditional alliances. This approach both
protects US strategic interests and encourages partners to self-adjust
their capabilities. Specifically, FOIP 2.0 focuses on increasing
training and transferring defense technology to potential partners
through initiatives such as FMS (conditional military sales) and EDA
(excess weapons transfer). These tools not only enhance the defense
capabilities of partners but also create long-term technological and
tactical dependencies, thereby consolidating influence more effectively.
In addition, economic measures such as tariffs can be used to force
countries in the region to choose sides with the US. Overall, under
Trump 2.0, the Indo-Pacific strategy aims to be more closely aligned
with regional realities. [The [Trump administration emphasizes]{.mark}
the [role of military capabilities]{.mark} and the ability to project
power [to maintain stability and prevent conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Current US moves focus on strengthening deterrence to prevent China from
changing the regional status quo, especially through the use of force.

ship and plane repair, including in Australia. **["[US allies]{.mark} in

Hegseth said.]{.underline}** "It has to be clear to all that **[Beijing

balance of power in the Indo-Pacific ... There's no reason to sugar coat
it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be

peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activity. He said
Donald Trump's administration had pushed European countries to boost
their defensive spending, taking on a greater "burden" of responding to
conflicts in their region, and it was time for Asian nations to do the
same. Hegseth, who in March was revealed to have told a Signal group
chat that Europe was "pathetic" and "freeloading" on US security support
in the region, told the Singapore conference it was "hard to believe" he
was now saying this, but Asian countries should "look to allies in
Europe as a newfound example". "Deterrence doesn't come on the cheap ...
time is of the essence." A new study by the organisation running the
Singapore event, the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies, found that Asian spending on weapons and research is currently
spiking, on top of what it said was a relatively consistent annual
average spend of 1.5% of GDP. **[Hegseth said the renewed European focus
on their region -- particularly [the Russia-Ukraine war -- allowed the
US to shift focus to its "priority theatre" in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Hegseth said the US did not seek to
"pressure" Asian countries to "embrace or adopt policies or ideologies",
but instead wanted to "work with you where our shared interests align
for peace and prosperity". "We're not here to preach to you about
climate change or cultural issues," he said. "But a threat gathers.
**["We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not seek to
instigate, subjugate or humiliate China. President Trump and US have an
immense respect for China and their civilisation. But we will not be
pushed out of this critical region."]{.underline}** In his speech
Hegseth also took a swipe at the absence of any senior Chinese delegate
at this year's conference. "We are here this morning and, notably,
someone else isn't," he said. Hegseth also appeared to reference
comments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the conference on
Friday that a "sense that \[the US's\] promise might not be so ironclad
is ushering in a new instability". Emmanuel Macron delivering his
keynote speech at the Shangri-La security dialogue in Singapore Europe
and Asia should form 'positive new alliance', says Macron in Singapore
"An alliance cannot be ironclad if in reality or perception it is
one-sided," Hegseth said on Saturday. **["As allies share the burden we
can increase our focus on the Indo-Pacific, our priority
theatre.]{.underline}**" He said the US would conduct its "first-ever
live-fire test of its mid-range capability system in Australia" in
coming months, and had expanded cooperations and joint exercises. **[[It
would]{.mark} also establish [repair capability and capacity programs in
the region]{.mark}, including for P-8 radar systems in Australia for the
US and its allies, [while expanding contracts for regional ship
repair]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Hegseth's speech reiterated much of the
Trump administration's defence and security position -- blaming the
previous administration for problems**[[, pledging to strengthen the US
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** and secure the US border against
unregulated immigration, while repeating plans to "take back the Panama
canal".

Should Close Its Overseas Military Bases" May 16, 2023, Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/05/16/military-defense-overseas-bases-united-states-force-posture/?
\[LQ\]

Over the past century, [[stationing troops]{.underline}]{.mark} at
[[overseas]{.underline}]{.mark} military installations like Diego Garcia
[[has become a cornerstone of U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign and
[[defense policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Today]{.underline}, the United
States has more overseas military bases than every other country
combined; its estimated 750 bases spread across 80 or more countries and
constitute 75 to 85 percent of the world's total overseas military
bases---likely more than any other people, nation, or empire in history.
And as anti-China consensus hardens within the U.S. political system and
[China builds up its own military presence in the Pacific]{.underline}
and elsewhere, [many believe that]{.underline} the strategy of [overseas
basing is more important than ever before]{.underline}.

But as the Chagossian experience demonstrates, this model is not without
its costs---not only moral but economic, political, and strategic, as
well. Despite being one of the most well-entrenched orthodoxies of U.S.
national security strategy, it may well be time for change. A growing
movement argues that rather than keeping the barbarians at the gate, the
gates themselves have drawn the United States into reckless and
unpopular conflicts, tempting policymakers into knee-jerk military
responses rather than diplomatic ones, and provoke enemies rather than
deter them. After decades of consensus, activists, scholars, and
veterans are now pushing back against what they see as a geopolitical
misstep, arguing that it's time to abandon these long-held outposts and
bring the troops home.

Since the Cold War, advocates of a forward-deployed posture claim that
these bases deter enemies, reassure allies, and help the U.S. military
respond rapidly in times of crisis. Despite major advances in military
technology in the past few decades, wars cannot be fought entirely from
a distance. [Having a physical presence near potential zones of conflict
is]{.underline} still [valuable for "signaling not only the capability
but, more importantly, the political will to fight]{.underline} in ways
long range systems cannot," political scientist Raphael S. Cohen wrote
in 2021. Essentially, proponents of the \[In the\] status quo argue that
**[[there's no replacing boots on the ground.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Although many presidents have sought to downsize the U.S. military
presence overseas in certain respects, this orthodoxy has changed little
since the 1940s, despite the radical transformation of warfare and
geopolitics since then. Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said as much himself in December 2020, when he remarked
that the United States has "too much infrastructure overseas and too
much permanent infrastructure," characterizing many bases abroad as
"derivative of where World War II ended." As such, many no longer find
the major arguments for this strategy compelling.

Instead of deterring enemies, U.S. overseas bases can often provoke
them. Just in March, the United States launched retaliatory airstrikes
against Iranian-affiliated targets in Syria after a coalition base came
under attack, which led to further attacks on U.S. facilities just a day
later. One American was killed and six more were wounded as a result. To
be fair, blaming bases as the sole provocation for attacks is
irresponsible. And proving that a forward-deployed posture deters
enemies is as difficult as finding the dog that didn't bark. But the
other justifications for this strategy aren't entirely compelling
either.

Overseas bases can indeed reassure allies, but in some cases, this
strategy may work too well and risks making allies complacent in their
own defense postures, content to free-ride off the United States'
largesse with little incentive to spend more on their own capabilities.

In other cases, the backlash is more pronounced. Rather than providing
reassurance, a U.S. military presence can stoke resentment among local
populations and their leaders, alienating the allies that bases were
intended to reassure. Labor violations, criminal conduct by U.S.
soldiers, and violations of sovereignty that occur at or near U.S.
military bases can jeopardize delicate diplomatic relationships and fuel
anti-U.S. movements among locals. Osama bin Laden famously cited the
presence of U.S. troops on foreign soil as one motivation for the 9/11
attacks. In November 2002, he wrote, "Your forces occupy our countries;
you spread your military bases throughout them." More recently, Okinawa
Gov. Denny Tamaki traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby Rep. Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers against the construction of a new U.S.
air base and for a reduced U.S. troop presence in his prefecture. Tamaki
said the new base would place a burden on the local population, make
them a target for attack, and violate Japan's constitutional provision
against the use of military force. Many other protests have occurred
across the U.S. empire of bases. This hesitation isn't unique. By one
count, since World War II, local populations in more than 30 countries
have taken to the streets to protest the U.S. military presence in their
backyards.

**[Even in an age of greater air power and advancing technology,
overseas [bases]{.mark} are still admittedly [advantageous for rapidly
responding to crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but that's not necessarily
a good thing. For the Cato Institute's John Glaser, U.S. leaders' easy
access to bases makes it too easy to engage in warfare. It would be
strategically better to deny them these tools of quick war and place
obstacles in their way, such as public debate or a congressional force
authorization vote, to avoid drawing the military into more unpopular,
illegal interventions. Andrew Bacevich, the chairman of the board at the
Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, emphasized this to me over
email: "A global military presence tends to underwrite a penchant for
ill-advised interventionism abroad. Put simply, a more modest global
posture might underwrite greater restraint."

To be sure, few anti-basing advocates would call for a complete
abandonment of overseas outposts. But even a **[[modest drawback could
allow for the realignment of the U.S. force posture to better match the
nature and location of current threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**---a
priority called for by both the Trump and Biden administrations'
National Defense Strategies. According to Becca Wasser, a senior fellow
at the Center for a New American Security, a fruitful place to start
paring back would be the enormous U.S. military infrastructure on the
Arabian Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf.

SINGAPORE (AP) --- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete [[Hegseth reassured
allies in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} on Saturday that they
will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure
from China, while insisting that they also contribute more to their own
defense. He said [[Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to
counter]{.underline}]{.mark} what the Pentagon sees as [[rapidly
developing threats by Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly in its
aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China has conducted numerous exercises
to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island,
which Beijing claims as its own and the U.S. has pledged to defend.
[China's army "is rehearsing for the real deal," Hegseth said in a
keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore. "We are not going
to sugarcoat it --- [the threat China poses is real]{.mark}.
[And]{.mark} it could be [imminent]{.mark}."]{.underline} The head of
China's delegation accused Hegseth of making "groundless accusations."
"Some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and
some are cases of a thief crying 'stop thief," said Rear Adm. Hu
Gangfeng, vice president of China's National Defense University. He did
not offer specific objections. "These actions are nothing more than
attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation
to destabilize the Asia-Pacific region," he said. China has a stated
goal of ensuring its military is capable of taking Taiwan by force if
necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an
aspirational goal than a hard war deadline. China also has built
sophisticated, artificial islands in the South China Sea to support new
military outposts and developed highly advanced hypersonic and space
capabilities, which are driving the United States to create its
own space-based "Golden Dome" missile defenses. Speaking at the
Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the
International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no
longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it's
"actively training for it, every day." Hegseth also called out China for
its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its
influence over the Panama Canal. He urged Indo-Pacific countries to
increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross
domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute. "We
must all do our part," Hegseth said. Following the speech, the European
Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas pushed back at Hegseth's comment that
European countries should focus their defense efforts in their own
region and leave the Indo-Pacific more to the U.S. She said that with
North Korean troops fighting for Russia and China supporting Moscow,
European and Asian security were "very much interlinked."
**[Hegseth]{.underline}** also **[repeated [a pledge made by previous
administrations to bolster the U.S. military]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific
[to provide a more robust deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [While both
the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to
the Pacific]{.underline} and established new military agreements
throughout the region, a full shift **[[has never been
realized]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, **[[U.S. military resources
from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military
needs in the Middle East and Europe,]{.underline}]{.mark}** especially
since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the first few months of President
Donald Trump's second term, that's also been the case. In the last few
months, the Trump administration has taken a Patriot missile defense
battalion out of the Indo-Pacific in order to send it to the Middle
East, a massive logistical operation that required 73 military cargo
aircraft flights, and sent Coast Guard ships back to the U.S. to help
defend the U.S.-Mexico border. Hegseth was asked why the U.S. pulled
those resources if the Indo-Pacific is the priority theater. He did not
directly answer but said the shift of resources was necessary to defend
against Houthi missile attacks launched from Yemen, and to bolster
protections against illegal immigration into the U.S. At the same time,
he stressed the need for American allies and partners to step up their
own defense spending and preparations, saying the U.S. was not
interested in going it alone. "Ultimately a strong, resolute and capable
network of allies and partners is our key strategic advantage," he said.
"China envies what we have together, and it sees what we can
collectively bring to bear on defense, but it's up to all of us to
ensure that we live up to that potential by investing." The Indo-Pacific
nations caught in between have tried to balance relations with both the
U.S. and China over the years. Beijing is the primary trading partner
for many, but is also feared as a regional bully, in part due to its
increasingly aggressive claims on natural resources such as critical
fisheries. Hegseth cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S.
military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk. "Economic
dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates
our defense decision space during times of tension," Hegseth said. Asked
how he would reconcile that statement with Trump's threat of steep
tariffs on most in the region, Hegseth he was "in the business of tanks,
not trade." But Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who is part of a
congressional delegation attending Shangri-La, objected to pressuring
regional allies. "The United States is not asking people to choose
between us and the PRC," Duckworth said, in reference to the People's
Republic of China. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles welcomed
Hegseth's assurance that the Indo-Pacific was an American strategic
priority and agreed that Australia and other nations needed to do their
part. "Reality is that there is no effective balance of power in this
region absent the United States, but we cannot leave it to the United
States alone," he said. Still, Marles suggested the Trump
administration's aggressive trade policies were counterproductive.
"**[[The shock and disruption from the high tariffs has been costly and
destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**." China usually sends its own
defense minister to the conference, but Dong Jun did not attend this
year in a snub to the U.S. over Trump's erratic tariffs war. His absence
was something the U.S. delegation said it intended to capitalize on. "We
are here this morning. And somebody else isn't," Hegseth said. Asked by
a member of the Chinese delegation how committed the U.S. would remain
if Asian alliances like ASEAN had differences with Washington, Hegseth
said the U.S. would not be constrained by "the confines of how previous
administrations looked at this region." "We're opening our arms to
countries across the spectrum --- traditional allies, non-traditional
allies," he said. He said U.S. support would not require local
governments to align with the West on cultural or climate issues.

The focus of US strategic thinking today is on China and the
Indo-Pacific region. This has remained so through multiple presidential
administrations and several years of complex global challenges,
including the COVID-19 pandemic. While the two major political parties
are far apart on many issues, there is remarkable bipartisan consensus
on the China challenge. An example is the US Innovation and Competition
Act, passed by a bipartisan 68--32 vote in the Senate in June
2021.**^1^** The legislation provides funds for key technological
sectors, including computer chips, where competition is fierce, seeking
to boost emerging fields and avoid Chinese dominance of key sectors. The
Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, issued by the Joseph Biden
administration in March 2021, describes China as "the only competitor
potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and
technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open
international system." Throughout the document, the Indo-Pacific and
China are consistently given first position as priorities for US
strategy. For example, "our presence will be most robust in the
Indo-Pacific and Europe" and "our vital national interests compel the
deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western
Hemisphere." Similarly, competition with China is discussed extensively,
in contrast to Russia, which is given relatively scant treatment. The
Biden administration is reflecting consensus in the US defense
community. The *2018 National Defense Strategy* similarly identified
China as the primary US problem and the Indo-Pacific as the priority
region.**^2^** The *2021 Annual Threat Assessment* from the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence describes "China's push for global
power."**^3^** Assessments from academia and the think-tank community
are part of this broad consensus, although there are degrees of
difference.**^4^** [**Alongside the clear strategic prioritization of
the Indo-Pacific comes a growing [interest in the Arctic region]{.mark},
although this [remains]{.mark} a far [low]{.mark}er [priority]{.mark}.**
The US Air Force,]{.underline}[5 Army,]{.underline}[6 and
Navy]{.underline}[7 all recently issued Arctic strategic papers, and the
Department of Defense (DOD) issued an Arctic strategy in 2019 as
well.]{.underline}[8 Interest is growing in the Arctic region for
several reasons, including the changing climate and Russia's
well-publicized military buildup along its extensive Arctic periphery.
In addition, the Chinese government has evident interest in the Arctic
region: its 2018 Arctic policy white paper describes China as "an active
participant, builder and contributor" and "an important stakeholder" in
Arctic affairs and identifies China's goals as "to understand, protect,
develop and participate in the governance of the
Arctic."]{.underline}[9]{.underline} These two regions---the
Indo-Pacific and the Arctic---may be adjacent, but they are very
different. Similarly, while China has expressed interest in the Arctic
region, it is geographically located in the Indo-Pacific. And yet
US-Chinese competition is a global phenomenon (and perhaps even beyond,
taking space into account). What does this growing interest in the
Arctic mean for the Indo-Pacific? How does prioritization of the
Indo-Pacific affect the Arctic? Placing growing strategic interest in
the Arctic in the context of the United States' overarching
prioritization of the Indo-Pacific yields actionable conclusions. A
first observation relates to DOD's position in the priority region. The
DOD continues to build its desired posture and balance of forces in the
Indo-Pacific. A decade after President Obama's "pivot to Asia,"**^10^**
the effort to rebalance US forces from the Middle East and Europe to the
Indo-Pacific continues to move slowly. At the time, then--Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton authored an article identifying key security
objectives in the Indo-Pacific: defending freedom of navigation in the
South China Sea, countering North Korean nuclear activities, and
transparency in key regional military activities.**^11^** Ten years
later, these challenges have grown: Zack Cooper and Adam Liff recently
wrote that "America still needs to rebalance to Asia."**^12^** DOD's
2019 "Indo-Pacific Strategy Report" noted that United States
Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) had more than 2,000 aircraft, 200
ships and submarines, and 370,000 personnel in its area of
responsibility, mostly in Japan and Korea.**^13^** Guam is a strategic
hub supporting US forces in the region. However, the Strategy Report
acknowledged the major challenges of readying US posture in the
Indo-Pacific for a high-end fight: "Our armed forces are learning to
expect to be contested throughout the fight."**^14^** Challenges include
force modernization across multiple new platforms (including unmanned
systems, cyber, and space), as well as the "tyranny of distance"---the
sheer distance of the Indo-Pacific from the United States.**^15^**
**[[The size of the Indo-Pacific region, and its distance from
the]{.mark} continental [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates[, raises the
costs of a]{.mark} US [rebalance.]{.mark}]{.underline}** These costs are
compounded by the high-end nature of military competition in the region,
as well as new generations of technology. In 2020, USINDOPACOM released
an investment plan, titled "Regain the Advantage," that laid out
resourcing requirements for "establishing the necessary linkages between
the strategy, required capacity, capabilities, and budgetary
priorities."**^16^** The plan called for more than \$20 billion over six
years.**^17^** The plan noted that "USINDOPACOM's force design and
posture must enable the convergence of capabilities from multiple
domains and create the virtues of mass without the vulnerability of
concentration,"**^18^** implicitly acknowledging the threat posed by
Chinese strike capabilities in theater. It went on to state that "this
requires a force posture and joint force laydown west of the
International Date Line . . . properly positioned to defend in depth,
while possessing the capabilities and authorities to respond to
contingencies across the region."**^19^** While USINDOPACOM is expected
to advocate for additional resources, it has found a receptive audience
in Congress. Congress established the Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(PDI) in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to improve the
posture and readiness of US forces in the region, devoting \$6.9 billion
over two years.**^20^** Much like the 2021 Innovation and Competition
Act, the PDI reflects bipartisan consensus on the challenge posed by
China and the need for extra resourcing to meet that challenge. The
bipartisan consensus on shoring up the US position in the Indo-Pacific
was underscored in July 2021, when Kurt Campbell, the Biden
administration's Indo-Pacific coordinator, gave remarks in which he
stated bluntly: "I think we recognize that the United States has a lot
of work to do. . . . We have historically a strong position in Asia.
That position has slipped and we are at risk, and we need to make
substantial investments across the board."**^21^** Much analysis has
focused on needed improvements to US force posture in the Indo-Pacific,
and many proposals are under discussion.**^22^** The PDI itself, as well
as the DOD's spending plan, have all received critiques. Nevertheless,
the roiling discussion makes clear that current US posture is not
considered adequate, that major new spending is politically feasible,
and that there are no simple solutions. **[In this context, it is hard
to imagine significant resources becoming available to other geographic
regions such as the Arctic.]{.underline}** **[[Congress is
facing]{.mark} a strong demand [signal in the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}, and
there appears to be [enough]{.mark} bipartisan [consensus to appropriate
funds to meet this priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, the larger
federal budget is under significant strain from ongoing pandemic-related
displacement, and a divided Congress has slowed the legislative process.
A second observation is the position of the United States' main
competitor: the military challenge posed by an increasingly assertive
China in the Indo-Pacific. As the DOD's 2020 annual report on China
states, the People's Liberation Army is growing in capabilities and
concepts, strengthening China's "ability to counter an intervention by
an adversary in the Indo-Pacific region and project power
globally."**^23^** A RAND report titled "War with China" concluded that
"fighting would start and remain in East Asia, where potential Sino-US
flash points and nearly all Chinese forces are located." Furthermore,
the RAND authors note that "much of the Western Pacific" could be
dragged into a war zone due to US and Chinese disposition of
forces.**^24^** In June 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin approved
a classified directive "ensuring that the department lives up to the
stated prioritization of China as the number one pacing
challenge."**^25^** Hal Brands has argued that, while "war is most
likely to break out along China's immediate periphery," the keys to
US-Chinese competition are the smaller states caught in the
middle.**^26^** Brands identified four---Germany, Djibouti, India, and
the Philippines---as particularly important. Notably, whether the prism
of conflict is on China's periphery or focused on third-party states,
the Indo-Pacific region is where the preponderance of risk is located.
Globally, competition with China is dispersed across
political-diplomatic, economic, and information domains. In 2020, the
administration of Donald Trump released a report titled "United States
Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China," identifying three
challenges posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the United
States. The first identified, "Economic Challenges," including
protectionist trade practices, especially linked with technology;
acquisition of US companies and assets; unauthorized cyber intrusions;
the spread of corruption and environmental degradation associated with
the massive Belt and Road Initiative; and the "use of economic leverage
to extract political concessions . . . or exact retribution."**^27^**
These concepts were expanded in a policy planning paper by the State
Department, released publicly in November 2020. The report, "The
Elements of the China Challenge," detailed what was termed "economic
co-optation and coercion abroad," including "debt-trap
diplomacy."**^28^** In the Arctic region, where the PRC has no sovereign
territory and no military presence to speak of as of yet, this is also
true. The Stimson Center's Yun Sun notes that "China's economic
engagement in \[the Arctic\] could be a precursor to much more invasive
political and strategic ambitions," as well as that "China's Arctic
infrastructure development has the potential for dual-use facilities,
paving the ground to Beijing's permanent security presence in the
region."**^29^** Therefore, competition with China in the Arctic is, at
present, not primarily military in nature. It is about preventing China
from developing an economic or political position in the region that
would justify a future military presence to protect. Evidence for this
conclusion can be seen in the annual unclassified DOD "China Military
Power Report," which in 2019 devoted a special section to China in the
Arctic that focused on Chinese oceanographic research in the Arctic,
"which could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the
Arctic Ocean \[and\] could include deploying submarines."**^30^** The
following year, this prospective language was absent.**^31^** In the
Arctic, strategic Chinese investments and influence-building activities
are concerning, and they are rightfully receiving scrutiny across the US
government.**^32^** The primary focus of economic or influence
competition with China in the Arctic region may not be within DOD,
although it is the largest department involved. State, Treasury,
Commerce, Energy, and other departments may play important roles.
Economic competition, including strategic investment, has received
significant attention in recent years, focusing on investment in the
United States as well as in third-party countries. For example, in 2018,
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was
strengthened through the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization
Act (FIRRMA), which broadened the authorities of both CFIUS and the
president to review and take action to address national security
concerns arising from certain foreign investments.**^33^** Treasury
implemented FIRRMA through two regulations, which went into effect in
February 2020. In brief, the FIRRMA regulations expanded and
strengthened CFIUS review to include minority investments, as well as
mandatory declarations for critical technologies, infrastructure, or
data, as well as foreign entities that are partly owned by foreign
governments.**^34^** In addition to congressional action to shore up
screening of foreign investment in the United States, the United States
is working to build consensus with allies and partners about the
challenges posed by China. Cyberhacking is a major focus: in July 2021,
the administration issued a statement noting "n unprecedented group of
allies and partners---including the European Union, the United Kingdom,
and NATO---are joining the United States in exposing and criticizing the
PRC's malicious cyber activities."**^35^** The June 2021 communiqué
issued by NATO contained language on China: "China's stated ambitions
and assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rules-based
international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security."
Greenland and Iceland frequently arise in discussions of potentially
harmful Chinese investment in the Arctic region. Notably, Chinese
strategic investment in Greenland and Iceland, as well as in other
Arctic states, takes on added significance and urgency in the context of
high-level US and NATO military interests in those locations: Thule Air
Base in Greenland, and Keflavik in Iceland. Even unspoken, potential
competition with China may be an element of US strategy in the Arctic.
For example, in May 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to
Greenland to meet with the Premier Mute Egede of Greenland. Secretary
Blinken explained, "I'm in Greenland because the United States deeply
values our partnership and wants to make it even stronger."**^36^** He
pointed to the reopening of the US consulate in Nuuk, Greenland's
capital, after 70 years, and explained, "At a time when the world is
ever more complicated and challenging, it's very important to
reinvigorate out---not only our alliances, but our partnerships with
countries that share our interests and values."**^37^** The subtext in
this statement is unmistakable. Competition with China in the Arctic
region therefore might be concentrated, at present, in forms of state
power other than military: in the DIME framework (diplomacy,
intelligence, military, economic), the D-I-E may be the most important
streams of effort in the short term, while China's military presence is
largely prospective. These observations frame the relationship between
the Arctic and Indo-Pacific regions. Further, they provide a basis for
developing strategic assumptions and recommendations for the future.
Placing the Arctic and Indo-Pacific into a strategic hierarchy of
US-Chinese competition in which the Indo-Pacific is primary and the
Arctic is secondary helps clarify policy choices. For example, one
strategic conclusion might be that low-cost diplomatic, intelligence,
and economic efforts should be centered in the Arctic, so that high-cost
military efforts can be focused on the Indo-Pacific; that these efforts
should increase US influence and block the growth of Chinese influence
in the Arctic.**^38^** Given the primary focus on the Indo-Pacific and
the need for expensive, high-end military capabilities---as well as
other spending on competitive domains, such as science and technology,
and space, as identified in the Innovation and Competition Act,
described above---an approach to the Arctic that centers on diplomacy,
intelligence, and economic development also may be fiscally achievable.
In the future, should China develop Arctic military capabilities, up to
and including polar-capable ballistic missile submarines, this strategic
calculus may evolve. However, the United States' focus on China as the
primary rival, and the Indo-Pacific as the primary theater of
confrontation, appears to be enduring. Assessments of Arctic strategy
should bear in mind that it is not the primary competitive theater
between the US and China and further that the Arctic should be prevented
from becoming a more competitive theater if at all possible.

Introduction As the danger of war rises in the Western Pacific, the
United States is racing to reset its military strategy. China's
astonishing military modernization---especially its arsenal of
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities---has fundamentally
challenged the old U.S. approach, which focused on defeating aggression
by projecting decisive power into the first island chain. In response,
the Pentagon is attempting a great inversion: to defeat Chinese power
projection against Taiwan or another target, it is emulating Beijing's
A2/AD strategy in hopes of making the Western Pacific a no-go zone for
hostile forces. This change, which some defense analysts have advocated
for years, is a necessary response to China's daunting capabilities. It
is a smart effort to make the geography of the region, and the inherent
difficulty of power projection, work for, rather than against, the
United States and its allies. Speed is essential in making this shift:
Even as the stated U.S. view is that conflict is "neither imminent nor
inevitable" in the Taiwan Strait, numerous U.S. officials have warned
that conflict could plausibly occur in the region this decade. This
urgency is catalyzing constructive action across multiple U.S. alliances
and every U.S. military service as they seek to make the strategy real
in the limited time that may be left. [Every strategy brings dilemmas,
though, and this strategy---call it "anti-access with American
characteristics"---presents six crucial trade-offs the Pentagon and U.S.
civilian leaders must address. Many of these challenges, moreover, must
be confronted in coordination with U.S. allies and partners, but these
conversations are not as advanced as they should be given the shrinking
timeline and urgency of action.]{.underline} Strategy is the art of
making hard choices, and the United States is only starting to reckon
with the hard choices its new strategy involves. Washington's Strategic
Shift U.S. strategy has been turned upside down by two key developments:
China's ballooning defense budget and its military-technological
breakthroughs. Using defense resources made available by decades of
rapid economic growth, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has developed
a vast arsenal of capabilities---especially long-range
missiles---designed to prevent U.S. forces from accessing bases along
the Pacific's first island chain, as well as in the waters and airspace
within them. According to the Pentagon's most recent public report on
Chinese military power, for instance, Beijing now possesses roughly
1,000 medium-range ballistic missiles with a range of between 1,000 and
3,000 kilometers and 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a
range of between 3,000 and 5,500 kilometers. If a war were to break out,
the PLA could now target nearly all U.S. forces within hundreds of miles
of the Chinese coast. The result is a weakening of America's ability to
project power in a crucial region. A quarter century ago, China could
barely detect, let alone destroy, U.S. aircraft carriers operating near
its coast. Into the early 2010s, the Pentagon could---according to think
tank reports---pursue a strategy that envisioned defeating Chinese
aggression with a devastating precision-strike campaign against radars,
missile bases, command-and-control centers, and other targets on Chinese
soil. Today, however, Beijing can threaten aircraft carriers hundreds of
miles away, as well as the surface ships that escort them and the bases
they visit. A growing inventory of advanced fighters, as well as the
world's densest air defense network, can take a heavy toll on U.S.
strike aircraft. Meanwhile, China's rapid nuclear buildup makes the
prospect of carrying the war onto its territory much riskier by giving
Beijing more credible nuclear response options. In short, the days of
easily projecting power to China's shores are over. The United States
needs new capabilities and concepts---as well as enhanced
coalitions---to offset this historic change in the military balance. To
be sure, the United States will continue to require ways of breaking
down China's battle networks and degrading its A2/AD capabilities. But
simply doubling down on the traditional power projection strategy will
not work under the current defense budget and in view of how formidable
China's A2/AD capabilities have become. Instead, U.S. forces are trying
to flip the script: they are trying to deny China the ability to project
its power outward. Rather than rely so heavily on a few large,
vulnerable bases and scarce, expensive platforms like aircraft carriers,
this strategy would empower smaller units that operate from more austere
locations and fight with cheaper, more numerous, and more expendable
weapons. The goal is to create a more resilient, diversified military
posture up and down the Western Pacific with sufficient firepower to
inflict an awful cost if the enemy attacks. The United States will not
be able to reassert the level of military dominance it once enjoyed in
the region, but it can prevent an age of Chinese dominance. What makes
this approach attractive is the fact that holding U.S. forces at bay is
only half the challenge China faces. To conquer Taiwan or otherwise
upend the regional status quo, Beijing must replicate the traditional
U.S. mission of power projection by moving troops, ships, and planes
into hostile areas and sustaining them there indefinitely. In fact,
Beijing is in the process of fielding four aircraft carriers with more
to come; it is building other long-range ships and aircraft that can
operate throughout the region and beyond. The more China invests in
these larger, more expensive platforms and the more it tries to exert
control in the Western Pacific, the more it makes itself the target of
the very strategy its own military has employed. The United States has
recently advanced several aspects of such a strategy. The first is real
estate. Washington has secured or expanded U.S. access to bases in
countries from Japan and the Philippines to Australia and Papua New
Guinea, a crucial step in making U.S. forces more survivable if China
attacks. There is significantly more work to do, but [2023 has been the
most transformative year in a generation for America's Indo-Pacific
posture. The second aspect is capabilities. The Pentagon has announced
programs such as the Replicator initiative, which seeks to build large
numbers of small, cheap drones that can deliver devastating firepower.
If these programs reach fruition, they could complement existing
platforms, such as attack submarines and penetrating bombers, that can
destroy Chinese forces within Beijing's A2/AD zone. A third aspect
involves concepts. The services are developing new (and somewhat
embryonic) ways of employing these technologies. Examples include
Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations, a Marine Corps initiative that
involves using antiship missiles and other ground-based fires to target
Chinese vessels from small islands in the Western Pacific, and Agile
Combat Employment, an Air Force project that aims to preserve U.S.
striking power by getting planes off of large, exposed bases when a
crisis begins.]{.underline} And fourth is coalitions. To generate the
necessary firepower, secure access to critical terrain, and confront
China with the prospect of a big war against multiple adversaries, the
United States has strengthened bilateral alliances with Australia,
Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines while also investing in new
partnerships---such as AUKUS---linking countries in the region and
beyond. To be clear, anti-access with U.S. characteristics is more of a
complement to than a pure replacement for the Pentagon's old approach.
Aircraft carriers and major surface combatants would be needed to defeat
a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, for instance, even if they suffered heavy
losses. Tactical fighters, long-range bombers, and other manned aircraft
will play an important role in delivering munitions and partnering with
unmanned systems. The United States will still need to find ways of
suppressing China's air defenses and hindering its kill chains. But
legacy approaches alone cannot defeat a Chinese attack at acceptable
cost. The United States needs asymmetric ways of thinning out enemy
forces and preventing them from achieving their objectives. To succeed,
the United States will need a two-part force. A blunting layer of
dispersed forces must survive the initial onslaught and prevent Chinese
forces from winning a quick, decisive victory. Then a follow-on force of
U.S. ships and aircraft will need to push into the theater to decisively
defeat the remaining Chinese units. Ultimately, this might not be
sufficient to terminate a conflict, but it would neutralize the
immediate threat and buy time for other options meant to persuade
Beijing to call it quits, such as a long-term economic pressure
campaign. America's new strategy, however, also raises new questions:
Can a blunting force remain effective if it is exposed to devastating
Chinese missile salvoes and cannot easily be resupplied? Could these
smaller units deter a conflict as well as larger and more visible ships
and aircraft could? Should U.S. power projection forces remain in the
first island chain or pull back to more defendable positions farther
away? How hard should the United States push for access to new bases?
Are allies prepared to play their part in this new strategy? And to what
extent would anti-access with U.S. characteristics just redirect China's
effort toward gray zone coercion? These are difficult questions. They
involve hard trade-offs between survivability and lethality, concealing
and revealing, close-in and standoff operations, speed and
sustainability, sovereignty and efficiency, and gray zone and
high-intensity conflict. As the United States tries to prepare for or,
preferably, deter a potentially devastating conflict, these six issues
require urgent attention and debate. Survivability or Lethality A
fundamental feature of today's environment is the development of
accuracy independent of range, which makes it possible to precisely
strike targets at great distances. This is why China's ballistic missile
force, the largest in the world, poses such a threat to the aircraft and
surface ships that the United States would need to project power into
the Western Pacific. Hardening airfields and investing in air and
missile defenses can help, but the cost-exchange ratio favors the
attacker, since most missiles are significantly cheaper than the
interceptors that engage them. If U.S. forces remain on large bases at
Guam or Okinawa, they risk being destroyed. Military units must disperse
and hide to survive. The dilemma is that once they do, they will
struggle to generate the striking power---the lethality---needed to
defeat a Chinese assault. This problem involves logistics and
sustainment: the more dispersed one's forces, the harder it is to keep
them well supplied. The Air Force, for instance, has shown it can get
attack aircraft out of vulnerable places in a hurry. Less certain is
whether it can deliver the fuel, weapons, and other support those planes
will need to conduct combat missions from wherever they go to ride out
the storm. If U.S. planes cannot fly strike missions in the opening days
or weeks of a Taiwan crisis, Taipei might fold and close Washington's
window to respond. Similar challenges afflict the Army's Multi-Domain
Operations concept. To be fair, the picture varies across the services.
By making significant changes to its force structure, the Marine Corps
has become better positioned to distribute small units across numerous
islands while also equipping them with real firepower. Yet services that
rely on large platforms (the Navy), large bases (the Air Force), or
large formations (the Army) have more work to do to make their forces
survivable without undermining their ability to land a lethal punch.
Conceal or Reveal As new operational concepts take shape around smaller,
more dispersed units, the Pentagon will face another challenge: how to
deter China with less visible forces. The accuracy of today's weapons
means visible forces are increasingly vulnerable, but the best
capabilities for deterring opponents and reassuring friends are those
they can plainly see. Alternatively, concealing capabilities can help
maximize their effect on the battlefield but undercuts their deterrent
value before a conflict begins. Take, for example, one of America's most
effective deterrents---the purported ability to disrupt Chinese power
projection by using cyberattacks to disable PLA command, control, and
communications. Disclosing the details of this capability would require
revealing U.S. access to Chinese networks, which would give Beijing a
chance to close breaches. The same basic problem would apply to
revealing new operating locations or highly secretive systems, such as
advanced undersea drones, stealthy aircraft, space-based capabilities,
and others. A related issue involves timing. Unveiling new capabilities
during a crisis might bolster deterrence but could come too late, after
Chinese leaders have made the crucial decision to act. Publicly
revealing new capabilities in the opening phases of a crisis could
increase tensions, complicate efforts to deescalate, and lead third
parties to blame Washington for the conflict. Admittedly, these are not
new problems. But they are made more difficult by the fact that the
United States no longer has such overwhelming conventional superiority,
so it must hold more in reserve to surprise Chinese military commanders
and complicate their operations after the shooting starts. Close-in or
Standoff A third trade-off involves geography: Where should the United
States place these more dispersed forces? For decades, U.S. power
projection was so effective that even massed forward-deployed forces
were largely invulnerable to enemy attack, and U.S. dominance was so
pronounced that even faraway forces could reach the theater in time to
make the vital difference. Today, however, China could do catastrophic
damage to the Pentagon's forward-most forces, whether they be ships near
the Taiwan Strait or units on the ground in Okinawa. Moreover, if China
can quickly establish dominance in and around the Taiwan Strait, assets
stationed farther away might not arrive soon enough to prevent a fait
accompli. Thus, the dilemma: if the United States stations most of its
combat power along the first island chain, the PLA could conduct a
crippling first strike. Yet if Washington keeps the bulk of its forces
over the horizon at bases in the second island chain or even farther
away, then China might be emboldened to try the fait accompli. Of
course, if Beijing chooses to kill a large number of Americans in a
first strike, it is probably choosing a long, bloody war with an enraged
superpower as well. But even in that case, U.S. allies would face the
possibility of being pounded as U.S. forces fight from distant
locations---not exactly a recipe for alliance cohesion in a crucial
moment. An answer---albeit an uncomfortable one---is to divide U.S.
forces into two elements. Some units would serve as frontline forces to
blunt Chinese attacks and reassure allied publics. These forces would
constitute a bulwark and a trip wire: they would deny China the option
of using force without bloodying U.S. personnel. They would commit the
United States to the fight while also giving Washington some combat
power early on. The objective of these forces would not be to establish
U.S. dominance within the first island chain but rather to prevent China
from dominating portions of the first island chain itself. Mobile forces
equipped with antiship and antiaircraft missiles would blunt Chinese
attacks on U.S. allies and partners. Ultimately, this blunting force
would also buy time and serve as a shield behind which standoff forces,
such as long-range stealth aircraft or other platforms capable of
delivering munitions from a distance, could operate at somewhat
decreased risk. Unfortunately, the costs to these close-in units could
be very high, so the United States might not want to place its most
advanced capabilities at risk---fifth-generation tactical aircraft, or
aircraft carrier strike groups, for instance---until it has succeeded in
degrading China's A2/AD capabilities, primarily through strikes
delivering from longer range. In the meantime, forward-stationed forces
might suffer ghastly losses. Speed or Sustainability A fourth trade-off
is political. Washington's new strategy is predicated on rapidly
diversifying U.S. operating locations from a handful of major U.S. bases
to a range of ally and partner bases, austere sites, and even some
civilian facilities. The United States has made remarkable progress in
this endeavor; key allies like Japan are expanding their military
footprints as well. Yet the harder Washington pushes to make use of
these locations today, the more it risks damaging critical
relationships. This tension is on display in Japan's southwest islands.
Okinawa, Miyako, Ishigaki, and Yonaguni are critical real estate given
their proximity to Taiwan. If the United States could, for instance,
station hordes of long-range antiship missiles on the outermost islands,
the military balance in the Taiwan Strait would change overnight. But
populations on some of these islands are ambivalent about a growing
Japanese military presence, let alone any sizable deployment of
Americans. If Washington pushes too hard, it risks alienating local
populations and causing diplomatic setbacks. If Washington does not push
hard enough, the United States and its allies might not be ready if a
conflict comes. The same point could be made regarding the Philippines.
Under President Joe Biden, the United States has made remarkable
progress in jump-starting implementation of the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement and gaining access to additional facilities in
that country. In theory, these facilities---some of which are on the
northern island of Luzon---could play a vital role in a Taiwan
contingency. In reality, what access the United States would have to
those facilities in a crisis remains uncertain. The more tensions
increase, the greater the need for the United States to have clarity
about this issue and to position more (and more capable) forces there.
Those needs may clash, however, with the political incentives of the
government in Manila, which would presumably prefer to defer hard
choices that could put local communities in the firing line if conflict
ensues. Sovereignty or Efficiency Allies and partners are central to
U.S. strategy because the China challenge is more serious than anything
the United States has faced in decades. Beijing can field a force so
large and potent that the United States cannot succeed on its own. Even
under the most favorable assumptions about the development of U.S. and
Taiwanese capabilities, the United States will still need---at a bare
minimum---access to bases in Japan and perhaps other countries. Yet,
after several decades in which allied contributions were a "nice to
have" but not a "need to have," there is little muscle memory in Asia
about how to conduct complex coalition operations in a high-intensity
environment. Getting the coalition dynamics right requires addressing
tough questions about roles, missions, capabilities, and---most of
all---politics. Which allies would be willing to commit their forces in
advance of a conflict? Under what circumstances would they do so? And
with what caveats about their use? The answers to these questions will
vary greatly from country to country, even from leader to leader. And
although it seems likely that close allies, such as Japan or Australia,
will indeed side with the United States if shooting starts, their
leaders are often unwilling, for understandable political and diplomatic
reasons, to make that commitment explicit in advance. Ideally, a
U.S.-led coalition would maximize efficiency: Washington would rely on
allies to build niche capabilities and focus on particular missions,
freeing up U.S. forces for the most daunting tasks. A similar argument
has been made for why Taiwan should ditch its expensive planes and
warships, which will probably be destroyed or disabled at the outset of
any conflict, and instead focus on antiship missiles, mines, and other
asymmetric capabilities that can help it survive until help arrives. But
Taiwan is hesitant to do this because it has no ironclad assurance help
will come---not even from the United States. This illustrates the larger
dilemma: if no one really knows who will or will not fight in a crisis,
a clean division of labor becomes dangerous because absent allies would
create glaring gaps. Political leaders in the Western Pacific naturally
want to preserve flexibility and protect sovereignty. Yet this
undermines efficiency by forcing Washington to plan for the possibility
that its allies will not show up. The dilemma works the other way as
well: the less reliable the United States seems due to resurgent
isolationism or political dysfunction, the less willing its allies will
be to make potentially costly commitments to fight by its side. Gray
Zone or High Intensity A final tension is between dealing with
day-to-day gray zone challenges---maritime coercion, menacing aerial
intercepts, and other pressure tactics short of war---and preparing for
the potential outbreak of a major conflict. Gray zone engagements
require frequent sorties, which wear down aircraft and their crews.
There is a real trade-off between showing the flag in the South China
Sea and training for high-intensity conflict. The Pentagon's preference
may be to concentrate intently on deterring high-intensity
conflict---the fight that the United States simply cannot afford to
lose---but even if it does so successfully, its friends will still
suffer as Beijing salami-slices the status quo. For example, the U.S.
military is heavily focused on a potential war in the Taiwan Strait,
most notably the challenge of rapidly sinking an invasion fleet. But
although this is the most dangerous contingency, it is not the only, or
perhaps even the most likely, one. Every day China is squeezing Taiwan,
using a high operations tempo and boundary encroachment to nibble away
at its buffer zones. Likewise, the challenge in the South China Sea is
not a matter of Beijing mounting an all-out invasion of the Philippines.
It involves using fishing boats, maritime militia, coast guard vessels,
and other capabilities to undermine sovereignty. Unfortunately, many of
the capabilities needed for gray zone scenarios are different from those
needed for high-end deterrence missions. Small units equipped with
antiship missiles may be lethally effective against an invasion fleet,
but they are of less use in helping the Philippines defend its
sovereignty against everyday encroachment or helping Japan cope with
pressure from Chinese aircraft over the East China Sea. In fairness,
this dilemma might well attend any U.S. defense strategy in the Western
Pacific. But the more Washington emphasizes high-end conflict scenarios
and anti-access forces, the sharper this trade-off will become. No Easy
Answers There are no perfect solutions to these challenges. Every choice
comes with risks and consequences. The best the United States and its
allies and partners can do is mitigate those risks to the extent
possible, which begins with recognizing that the requirements of
assurance, deterrence, and warfighting often cut in different
directions---and that Washington cannot adequately address any of these
dilemmas on its own. As discussed, the Pentagon may envision addressing
the competing imperatives of assurance, deterrence, and warfighting by
effectively bifurcating the force. An "inside force" located within the
first island chain would reassure allies of U.S. commitment and dissuade
China from thinking it can succeed with a rapid fait accompli. If war
occurs, it will be supplemented by an "outside force," located mostly
beyond the immediate reach of China's most potent A2/AD assets, which
would provide the bulk of the striking power needed to turn back a PLA
assault and eventually end the conflict on favorable terms. Yet that is
only a partial answer to the dilemmas raised here, many of which will
persist even if the United States optimizes different parts of its
forces for different tasks. One requirement for more squarely
confronting trade-offs between speed and sustainability, between
survivability and lethality, and so on would be closer coordination
between the officials responsible---in the United States and friendly
countries---for operational planning, capability development, and
alliance management. After all, the hardest trade-offs tend to arise at
the intersection of these tasks. But even within the U.S. government, it
is not clear that the dilemmas are as sharply understood, or as
explicitly acknowledged, as they could be. When the authors recently
traveled to the region, we were struck that many of these dilemmas are
not really being debated yet with key allies and partners. This is a
potentially costly mistake. [**[Each trade-off has extensive
implications for Indo-Pacific]{.mark} allies and partners; addressing
them requires not just understanding but also extensive military reforms
and sensitive political guidance from U.S. friends.** The U.S. military
no longer possesses power projection capabilities so overwhelming it can
determine its strategy independently and then seek the acquiescence of
like-minded nations. For the first time in decades, Washington must
truly integrate its Asian friends into its most crucial strategic
debates---as well as the training, exercises, contingency planning
processes, and wargames that both inform and flow from those
debates.]{.underline} **[[The alternative is a strategy that becomes
dangerously disjointed as the United States]{.mark} and other defenders
of the Asian order [confront difficult choices in divergent
ways.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Given the growing worry about crises or
conflict, there is little time to waste. The shorter the time horizon
gets, the starker the trade-offs will become. Hard dilemmas are the
price to pay for decades of lethargy in dealing with a growing Chinese
challenge. If the United States, its allies, and its partners do not
confront these issues head-on today, the consequences could be ugly
tomorrow.

From India's continental security perspective, according to Debendra
Sanyal, "China's play in South Asia involves encircling India in the
region, a strategy similar to that employed in the Chinese game weiqi,
where the goal is to surround more territory than the opponent, thereby
restricting the opponent's moving space."\[23\] As China continues to
expand its coercive foreign policy, **[India]{.underline}** [finds
itself compelled to]{.underline} **[navigate]{.underline}** [its
engagement]{.underline} **[with China]{.underline}**. Beijing's
strategic deployments form distinct "outward arcs of expansion,"
extending over the waters of the East China Sea (ECS) and SCS, as well
as across land in Indian territories such as Arunachal Pradesh and
Ladakh. Given these dynamics, [India faces]{.underline} **[no
alternative]{.underline}** [but to manage]{.underline} [and
confront]{.underline} **[China's]{.underline}** [growing]{.underline} **[influence]{.underline}** [in
the region]{.underline}.\[24\]

[India's]{.underline} **[maritime]{.underline}** [domain presents
distinct]{.underline} **[security dynamics]{.underline}**. China has
strategically established land routes, notably the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor (CPEC) terminating at Gwadar port, and the
China-Myanmar Economic Corridor linking to ports at Yangon and Kyaukpyu.
These investments strategically position China to access both the
Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, effectively encircling India's
eastern and western coasts. Despite India's 15,000 km of land borders,
which include 6,798 km of hostile borders with Pakistan and China, the
remaining 8,202 km shared with Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar facilitate
limited trade, highlighting the pivotal role of the Indian Ocean region
(IOR) in India's future growth. India boasts a coastline stretching
7,516 kilometers, with its peninsula extending 1,980 kilometers into the
Indian Ocean. This positioning grants India exclusive rights over an
expansive area of 2.02 million square kilometers, with half of the basin
lying within a 1,500 kilometer radius of the mainland and its island
territories. [The]{.underline} [strategic]{.underline} **[significance]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[IOR]{.underline}** [to India cannot be
overstated]{.underline}, [given]{.underline} factors such
as **[geography]{.underline}**, **[energy]{.underline}** resources, **[trade]{.underline}** routes,
natural **[resources]{.underline}**, [sea lines]{.underline} of
communication, **[security]{.underline}** considerations, [and regional
geopolitics]{.underline}. Recognizing these imperatives, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi has designated the IOR as a "policy priority," as
reflected in India's maritime initiative Security and Growth for All in
the Region (SAGAR).\[25\]

Conversely, [China views
the]{.underline} **[IOR]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} **[vital]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [economic]{.underline} **[growth]{.underline}**, **[trade]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [broader]{.underline} **[regional
interests]{.underline}**. At the core of China's maritime strategy lies
its Malacca dilemma---the strategic importance of the Malacca Strait, a
vulnerable chokepoint through which 80% of its oil imports pass.\[26\]
Any threat to access through this strait raises significant concerns for
China's energy and trade security. [From India's security
perspective]{.underline}, the Malacca Strait serves as a crucial link
connecting [the IOR to the SCS]{.underline}, [highlight]{.underline}ing
the **[interdependence]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[Indian
Ocean]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[SCS]{.underline}** [in the
region's]{.underline} **[strategic calculus]{.underline}**.\[27\]
Moreover, the SCS acts as a vital maritime connector between the Indian
and Pacific Oceans, impacting both regions. China's expanding maritime
reach is evident in the increased presence of the People's Liberation
Army Navy (PLAN) and activities such as antipiracy missions off the
Somali coast and in the Gulf of Aden. China's extensive developmental
investments in strategic ports and maritime bases, including Djibouti,
Gwadar, Hambantota, and others totaling 13 in the region, bolster its
shipping and submarine capabilities.\[28\] According to the Indian Navy
Chief, [the]{.underline} **[PLAN]{.underline}** [maintains a
sustained]{.underline} **[presence]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} **[IOR]{.underline}**, with six to eight ships deployed
at any given time.\[29\] Despite challenges in the ECS and SCS, the
PLAN's increased presence in the IOR remains apparent, [emphasizing
the]{.underline} **[enduring relevance]{.underline}** [of Alfred Thayer
Mahan's insights on the]{.underline} **[Indian
Ocean]{.underline}**.\[30\]

The New Great Game

In his August 2007 address to the Indian parliament, Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe foresaw the convergence of the Pacific and Indian Oceans as
catalysts for freedom and prosperity, envisioning a vast network
spanning the Pacific and encompassing the United States and Australia.
This strategic alignment between Japan and India marked a revival of
their relationship based on shared values and interests, motivated in
part by China's escalating belligerence and coercive foreign
policy.\[31\] Recognizing India's pivotal role in the Indo-Pacific, Abe
elevated the country's importance in Japan's foreign policy.\[32\]

In the early 2000s, the Indo-Pacific concept struggled to gain traction
as global attention fixated on the scourge of international terrorism.
During this time, China's actions regarding Taiwan and the South China
Sea raised significant regional concerns.\[33\] Despite these actions,
Beijing, cognizant of its military limitations, exercised strategic
restraint. By positioning itself as an opportunity rather than a threat,
China successfully assuaged fears among numerous Asian nations. During
this period, Beijing's bold commitment to services liberalization upon
joining the World Trade Organization sparked a notable shift in foreign
direct investment toward service industries. By 2009, this shift had
tripled investment in services and increased manufacturing by 81
percent, resulting in a surge of multinational corporations flocking to
invest in China.\[34\]

Amid accelerated military modernization and an 18 percent increase in
defense budget in 2007, US Vice President Dick Cheney bluntly remarked
that China's "military buildup is not consistent with the country's
stated goal of a peaceful rise."\[35\] The subsequent global financial
crisis and ensuing US recession provided China with a strategic opening
to assert its regional presence and influence. Adopting a more assertive
stance, China began to assert its maritime territorial claims in the
SCS, ECS, and along its borders with India.

From 2013 onward, Xi's "Asia for Asians" security concept challenged US
alliances, which Beijing viewed as the Achilles' heel and a major
impediment to a peaceful Asia, ushering in heightened strategic
competition.\[36\] Beijing's long-term strategy of steadily growing
military capability and capacity is evident in its defense white papers
spanning the past two decades.\[37\] Through aggressive leveraging of
comprehensive national power, China aims to reclaim perceived
territories and maritime spaces, promoting an alternative world order
aligned with its Zhōngguó dream. Undoubtedly, China's aspiration for
great-power status is directed toward the United States, viewing
dominance in Asia as a precursor.

Historically, China viewed India solely through the prism of its
relationships with the Soviet Union and the United States, failing to
recognize India's inherent qualities or acknowledge its agency. Instead,
Beijing regarded India as inferior and untrustworthy, particularly in
light of ongoing territorial disputes.\[38\] Seeking to assert influence
and control over South Asia, China was confident that it could resolve
issues on its terms as it pursued its revanchist Zhōngguó dream of
national rejuvenation.

However, India's resolute response to Chinese aggression in the Doklam
and Galwan border crises of 2017 and 2020--2021 underscores New Delhi's
stance that any disturbance of peace and tranquility along the border
will significantly impact bilateral relations.\[39\] As US Indo-Pacific
(INDOPACOM) commander ADM John Aquilino observes, China's adoption of a
2021 land borders law allowing greater involvement of the PLA in border
security represents a continuation of its lawfare strategy aimed at
justifying military actions in territorial disputes. Moreover, China has
significantly expanded its military infrastructure along the Line of
Actual Control, intensifying pressure on India and enhancing its
readiness for potential future conflicts. These actions, intended to
expand borders and consolidate gains, contribute to regional instability
and heighten the risk of unintended incidents.\[40\]

The Indo-Pacific concept, stemming
from [the]{.underline} [US]{.underline} **[Asia-Pacific]{.underline}** [rebalancing]{.underline} [strategy]{.underline}, [has]{.underline} [evolved]{.underline} into
the comprehensive US Indo-Pacific Strategy, aiming to bolster American
presence and influence in the region. This strategy encompasses
diplomatic, economic, and security
dimensions, [striving]{.underline} [to cultivate a]{.underline} [free
and]{.underline} **[open
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**, [strengthen]{.underline} **[alliances]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[counterbalance]{.underline}** [China's]{.underline} [growing]{.underline} **[influence]{.underline}**.
Through initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and
AUKUS trilateral with Australia and the United Kingdom, Washington seeks
to manage strategic challenges posed by China's rise, promoting a
rules-based international order, human rights, and regional
cooperation.\[41\]

In May 2018, the rebranding of US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific
Command underscored the pivotal role of the region and the burgeoning
significance of India in the escalating US rivalry with China. India's
consistent economic expansion, burgeoning geopolitical influence, and
unwavering adherence to foundational principles, aligning with those of
normative global powers, position it as a disruptor to China's dominance
in Asia and a swiftly escalating strategic priority.

Vijay Gokhale asserts that China may need to come to terms with the
existence of an alternate great-power triangle in the
Asia-Pacific/Indo-Pacific, excluding Russia. The United States and its
allies in the region stand as the primary pillars of this triangle, with
China as the secondary pillar and India as the third. Soon, no other
nation or coalition, be it Russia, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, or the Gulf Cooperation Council, will possess the capacity to
replace any of these key players, given their blend of economic strength
and military prowess.\[42\]

Chinese scholars' analysis since 2019 perceives the Indo-Pacific
framework as a strategic maneuver by the United States aimed at imposing
limitations on China's growth. According to this view, Washington seeks
to constrain China's current development model, thereby maintaining and
furthering its own asymmetric advantages with the ultimate goal of
prevailing over China.\[43\] In parallel, the US National Security
Strategy identifies Beijing's "ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of
influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world's leading power. .
. . \[and that\] . . . Competition with the PRC is most pronounced in
the Indo-Pacific."\[44\]

China's aggressive exploitation of the abundant hydrocarbons, minerals,
and fish resources in the SCS, encroaching upon the exclusive economic
zones of neighboring nations, has fueled instability in the region.
Recognizing its role as an Indo-Pacific power, the United States
perceives the preservation of freedom of navigation and the cultivation
of regional consensus for open access to the SCS as imperative. This
strategic stance directly challenges China's interests.\[45\]

[India's]{.underline} **[strategic interests]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} **[IOR]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [interests

when viewed through the lens of a shared apprehension regarding China,

principles]{.underline}** [and a]{.underline} commitment to
a **[rules-based]{.underline}** [international]{.underline} [order]{.underline},
among other shared values.

While the United States' regional concerns in the Indo-Pacific
predominantly revolve around maritime
issues, **[India]{.underline}** [faces a more]{.underline} **[immediate
threat]{.underline}** [due to]{.underline} [the simultaneous presence of
two]{.underline} **[nuclear-armed]{.underline}** [adversaries]{.underline},
both of which enjoy a strategic partnership. India's historical
experience of enduring continental
threats, [including]{.underline} multiple conflicts
with **[Pakistan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} one
with **[China]{.underline}**, has now extended into the maritime realm.
This shift is underscored by significant efforts to bolster the Pakistan
Navy with Chinese support, along with increased bilateral maritime
exercises between Pakistan and China.\[46\]

The existence of a clear and present danger of conflict with these two
neighbours is a harsh reality in the continental domain for India, a
conflict it will have to "go it alone." The reality
of [this]{.underline} **[tenuous]{.underline}** [peace]{.underline},
which [can]{.underline} **[escalate]{.underline}** [to a
conflict]{.underline} [as it has in the past]{.underline}, often gets
missed in the larger US-centric Indo-Pacific narrative.

Consequently, India seeks to maintain a distinction between its military
engagements and exercises with Western and regional powers and its
involvement in broader regional groupings and security frameworks. A
robust and capable India is essential for fostering stability and
balance in Asia and beyond, as it offers a counterweight to the current
geopolitical dynamics.

As Robert Kaplan contends regarding India, "Its great power status in
the new century will be enhanced by its very political and military
competition with China, even as it is pinned down by frontiers with weak
and semi-dysfunctional states inside the subcontinent."\[47\]

China's conduct in South Asia is influenced by its apprehension of
inadvertently driving India closer to the United States' sphere of
influence. The prospect of an adversarial alliance along its extensive
southwestern continental border presents a significant concern for
China, as it would expose it to a two-front threat scenario. Conversely,
the emergence of India and US allies as two formidable pillars in the
region, with China occupying the third position, contributes to a
broader normative framework

Despite Beijing's assertive rhetoric, the Quad's unconventional
structure, devoid of typical alliance formalities and characterized by
its "informal, club-like nature," elucidates its current operational
dynamics and longevity. India's deepening engagement with Quad partners,
as highlighted by the Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar's intriguing
references to the "rediscovery of America," "rising with the sun," and
"building a new mateship," has significantly broadened. This expanded
engagement spans across various domains, facilitating a comprehensive
spectrum of interactions aimed at garnering mutual traction, learning,
and shared experiences.\[48\]

Considering the increasing significance of the Indo-Pacific, maintaining
the Quad as a crucible for ongoing reinforcement by its members emerges
as a prudent long-term strategy. This approach not only keeps China
uncertain about its future implications but also ensures the flexibility
for the group to adapt to any potential future contingencies.

Just a Maritime Game?

Up to this point, the discourse surrounding the Indo-Pacific has
predominantly revolved around maritime affairs. This emphasis is
unsurprising considering that seas have historically served as crucial
conduits for transportation, trade, and diplomacy, acting as both a
military asset and a diplomatic tool for colonial powers to assert
political influence. Mahan famously likened the seas to a great highway
or a vast common space, highlighting their pivotal role in facilitating
easier and more cost-effective transport compared to overland routes. He
argued that control of maritime routes was indispensable for any nation
aspiring to great-power status, with Britain serving as the
quintessential example.\[49\]

In addition to its significance for commerce and geopolitical influence,
the maritime domain continues to be valued for its abundance of
resources, territorial waters, rights of passage, and the vital
principle of freedom of navigation. However, while maritime security
remains a primary focus, encompassing the protection of commerce during
peacetime and the safeguarding of sea lines of communication during
wartime, the question arises: Can traditional surface-centric maritime
power projection be effectively pursued in isolation?\[50\]

During World War II, major naval powers came to the realization that air
power was indispensable for achieving sea control and projecting
maritime strength inland, leading to the emergence of carrier-based
aviation.\[51\] The limited speed, range, and operational capabilities
of land-based aircraft in the past necessitated the integration of
aircraft carriers into naval battle groups for effective sea control or
denial.

The increasing recognition of the importance of the vertical dimension
above the maritime domain, particularly evident in the contemporary
Indo-Pacific context, is exemplified by developments in the SCS. This
acknowledgment underscores the evolving nature of maritime power
projection, where considerations of airpower and aerial dominance play
an increasingly pivotal role alongside traditional surface-based
capabilities.

Securing its coastal waters, the linchpin of China's economic
prosperity, has remained a top national priority, leading Beijing to
focus its strategies on safeguarding its vital maritime arteries---the
two seas. The PLA Navy's assertive deployment to protect and expand
China's maritime interests and influence in the region has been evident.
However, Beijing has long recognized that achieving dominance in distant
maritime domains necessitates airpower, particularly considering the
threat posed by US carrier strike groups (CSG).

While China is aggressively bolstering its own carrier battle group
capabilities, it still faces challenges in controlling the airspace over
the SCS. The asymmetric airpower advantage enjoyed by US CSGs has
historically disadvantaged the PLA Air Force (PLAAF). Nonetheless, the
PLAAF's rapid modernization in recent years has positioned it as a
critical component of China's anti-access/area-denial (A2AD) strategy,
furnishing both offensive and defensive capabilities. This strategy
primarily aims to impede the effective deployment of US CSGs in the
region.

The forward positioning of sensors and weaponry on China's artificial
island bases reinforces the A2AD perimeter in the SCS, extending the
range and coverage of its defensive umbrella. The PLAAF's operational
patterns underscore the enduring principle of air power articulated by
Giulio Douhet a century ago---the imperative of achieving air
superiority.\[52\] The PLAAF's swift advancements prompted Gen Mark
Welsh, the US Chief of Staff of the Air Force, to caution the House
Appropriations Committee in 2016 that China's aircraft inventory could
rival, if not surpass, that of the United States by 2030.\[53\]

Asserting irredentist sovereignty claims over island territories in the
region under the pretext of reclaiming its "historical" spaces is a
cornerstone of China's strategic approach. This stance led China to
establish an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the waters of
the ECS, encompassing areas disputed with Japan and Taiwan, in 2013,
triggering international outcry.\[54\] While the PLAAF was unable to
enforce the ADIZ at the time, the political declaration had significant
ramifications. It emboldened the PLAAF to extend its air operations
beyond mainland boundaries into maritime domains, marking a strategic
shift from its previous focus on defense to a more assertive and
offensive posture.\[55\]

Subsequently, the PLAAF conducted multiple combat exercises over the
Western Pacific Ocean and the SCS, signaling its heightened capabilities
and intentions. The prospect of future ADIZ enforcement in the ECS
and/or the SCS could have profound disruptive effects, particularly
given the significant volume of civilian air traffic in Southeast Asia's
aviation sector.

Contested sovereignty over regional airspaces would impact various
facets of the aviation industry, including airlines, airports, and
tourism supply chains. Civil aviation plays a vital role in the GDPs of
Southeast Asian countries, with passenger traffic reaching 510 million
in 2019, representing 11 percent of global air traffic, and attracting
144 million visitors, including 98 million arriving by air. This
generates passenger traffic of approximately 196 million and accounts
for about 17 percent of global international air cargo traffic.\[56\]

The extensive presence of more than 300 regional airports offering
scheduled commercial services, along with 60 Southeast Asian airlines
operating scheduled passenger services utilizing 1,696 aircraft, and 21
Low-Cost Carriers managing a combined fleet of nearly 800 aircraft,
underscores the potential for substantial disruption in the region. This
abundance of infrastructure and air transportation resources presents a
significant strategic leverage opportunity.\[57\] Utilizing its three
artificial island air bases and its growing capability to enforce ADIZs,
the PLAAF's land-based airpower will empower the PRC to intimidate,
coerce, and exert heightened political pressure.

The impact of the PLAAF's expanded role as a coercive military tool is
reflected in the significant increase in air violations of Taiwan's
ADIZ, soaring by 79 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2023, Taiwan's
Ministry of National Defense reported detecting a total of 4,679 Chinese
aircraft in proximity to its airspace, with 1,674 intruding into its
ADIZ.\[58\]

Presently, routine violations typically involve one to five aircraft,
while assertive violations typically entail six to nine aircraft.
Reactionary violations, involving 10 or more aircraft and often linked
to geopolitical developments, political signaling, or displays of force,
accounted for 20.5 percent of violations in 2022.

Recent missions in the region have witnessed a surge in numbers,
duration, and complexity, often featuring J-10, J-16, and J-20 fighters,
H-6 strategic bombers, KJ-500 airborne early warning and command
aircraft, and Y-20U tanker aircraft. The proliferation of routine
violations and assertive air operations by the PLAAF has effectively
nullified the unofficial Taiwan Strait centerline, a previously
respected boundary intended to mitigate unintended tensions and apply
pressure on the island's inhabitants.\[59\] This strategy by Beijing
aims to establish "new normals," wherein routine violations over land,
sea, and in the air are escalated to a level where they are perceived as
commonplace, deliberately reshaping the status quo in boundary
matters.\[60\]

The US pullback in 2020 of its continuous bomber presence, a significant
deterrent presence in the region for 16 years, aligns with the
2018 National Defense Strategy's emphasis on operational
unpredictability. According to the US Strategic Command, "The US has
transitioned to an approach that enables strategic bombers to operate
forward in the Indo-Pacific region from a broader array of overseas
locations, when required, with greater operational resilience."\[61\]

Despite the explanations provided, the expansion of the PLAAF's air
operations, such as deploying long-range H-6 bombers armed with
air-launched cruise missiles to Guam in the second island chain, has
fostered the perception of a US withdrawal from the region, not solely
aimed at reducing its vulnerable footprint. Over time, the increasing
capabilities of Chinese weapons, systems, and platforms have heightened
the vulnerability of US CSGs in the region, posing a more
formidable threat than Japan did in mid-1944.\[62\]

The existing medium-range access denial weapon systems are integrated
with China's continuous surveillance intelligence, reconnaissance
capability utilizing geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) optical and
synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites to identify and track threats,
a combination tailored to China's security priorities. The Yaogan-41
satellite notably enhances China's capability to detect and track not
only naval vessels but also aircraft.\[63\]

This suggests that while the US may currently employ its CSGs for power
projection and signaling within the Second Island Chain region, doing so
in a conflict scenario may not be operationally feasible.\[64\] In its
annual report on Chinese military power last year, the Pentagon
acknowledged the threat posed by DF-21s, cautioning that these missiles
provide China with "the capability to conduct long-range precision
strikes against ships, including aircraft carriers, out to the Western
Pacific from mainland China."\[65\] 

Currently, the longest-ranged land-based combined anti-ship missile
firepower of DF-26 ballistic missiles and bombers, capable of posing a
threat to naval targets, is estimated to extend up to 1,800 miles from
the mainland.\[66\] This capability is one that China is likely to
enhance in the future as it persists in prioritizing its goal of
acquiring six aircraft carriers by 2035.

The traditional views and principles regarding the significance of
maritime power require careful reconsideration for the future of the
broader Indo-Pacific and IOR. While maritime power remains crucial, it
is essential to accord equal importance to other emerging domains,
particularly air, space, and cyber, given their increasing
interconnectedness and interdependencies. Technologies such as
hypersonic weapons, space glide vehicles, fractional orbital bombardment
systems, early warning systems, antisatellite capabilities (including
co-orbital systems), directed energy weapons, high-powered lasers, and
space-enabled electronic jamming and cyber warfare have become integral
components of the future threat landscape. As vulnerabilities in the
maritime domain escalate, the once-dominant focus on maritime operations
is no longer sufficient.

The historically undervalued vertical dimension has been rapidly
overshadowed by technological advancements in the air and space domains
over the past few decades. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess and
broaden our perspective of the Indo-Pacific and IOR beyond a purely
maritime lens. As future developments and advancements in land, air,
sea, space, and cyber capabilities unfold, adopting a comprehensive
multi-domain security approach becomes increasingly vital. 

During the transitional phase until space and cyber security
capabilities mature for collective regional implementation, the
underutilized potential of land-based airpower in the Indo-Pacific and
IOR represents a near and medium-term capability that warrants greater
investment.

More Players in the Game

The scale of the PLAN's East and South fleets is significantly greater
than the capabilities of regional navies. Beijing's aggressive
utilization of its blue hull Maritime Militia and the China Coast Guard
as part of a gray-zone strategy to advance its sovereignty interests
amplifies the risk of maritime incidents, accidents, and conflicts that
could disrupt the global supply chain and induce economic instability,
adding to the complexity of the situation.

China's efforts to enhance its regional dominance extend beyond the
maritime domain to encompass air, cyber, space, electromagnetic,
subsurface, and emerging security domains such as the deep sea, quantum
computing, artificial intelligence, and biological security.\[67\] While
developments in these new security domains are ongoing, the expansion of
the PLA's land-based air power capability complements the PLAN's growing
carrier capabilities.

China has expanded its presence and infrastructure across at least seven
reefs and artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, including Subi
Reef, Mischief Reef, Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, Gaven Reef, Fiery Cross
Reef, and Cuarteron Reef. Notably, Subi, Fiery Cross, and Mischief Reefs
now feature airfields capable of supporting fighter operations, enabling
the deployment of a variety of aircraft such as fighters, bombers,
maritime reconnaissance aircraft, airborne early warning and control
(AEWC) aircraft, tanker aircraft, and advanced surface-to-air missile
(SAM) systems. This enhances the PLAAF's ability to project power over
both air and maritime spaces in the SCS and beyond, facilitating broader
control of the airspace.

From a perspective of cooperative defense and regional security among
Southeast Asian countries, nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Vietnam possess relatively small air forces
characterized by a mix of aging and limited modern combat assets. In
contrast, Singapore and Taiwan boast modern air force inventories.
Individually, none of these nations can rival the capabilities of the
PLAAF. However, all are undertaking efforts to modernize their air
forces, recognizing them as perhaps the sole viable conventional
hard-power option to bolster their limited maritime capabilities.

Collectively, these air forces represent an asymmetric instrument for
asserting sovereignty against a dominant China in the nine-dash-line
region, expanding the range of response options to counter its
increasing capabilities.\[68\] India, the United States, and Australia
are already engaged in various bilateral and multilateral air exercises
with many of these nations, offering opportunities for further
collaboration. It raises questions as to why this aerial dimension has
been overlooked in maritime strategy. 

The oversight of incorporating land-based airpower into the maritime
security discourse has, to a degree, been a casualty of various factors.
Firstly, domain-centric exclusivity has led services to vie for
exclusive ownership of domains, overshadowing the potential integration
of airpower. Additionally, navies historically maintain closer
governmental engagement in executing foreign policies and addressing
regional geopolitics linked with maritime nations. Moreover, the
historical limitations of airpower, including deficiencies in aerial
refueling and long-range capabilities of combat platforms, hindered its
prominence. The last significant exclusively maritime warfare involving
airpower occurred during World War II. These factors collectively
contributed to the oversight of recognizing the crucial role of
land-based airpower in maritime security.

The recent consolidation of People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)
aviation assets, encompassing fighters, bombers, air defense, and air
surveillance radars, under the People's Liberation Army Air Force
(PLAAF) signifies a strategic shift to streamline defensive operations
and synchronize all air-based maritime strike capabilities.\[69\] This
move underscores the pivotal role of land-based air power in China's
present and future regional strategies. Furthermore, it acknowledges the
critical importance of airpower in controlling the aerial domain within
a joint multi-domain approach, emphasizing the need to strengthen
service-specific core competencies without redundancy. The expanding
influence of the PLAAF, reinforced by the People's Liberation Army
Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), across the Indo-Pacific and IOR, will
soon be complemented operationally by the growing carrier capabilities
of the PLAN. 

Integrating land-based air power into the security architecture of the
Indo-Pacific and IOR holds significant promise for enhancing regional
security dynamics, particularly in light of China's comprehensive
multi-domain strategy. Neglecting this aspect would be a strategic
oversight.

Addressing the challenge posed by the long-range capabilities of
land-based air power can be effectively managed through enhanced
cooperative interoperability and shared use of assets and bases among
partners, leveraging the operational locations organized by INDOPACOM.
These locations, both permanent and rotational, form clusters that
enhance regional defense capabilities.\[70\]

In the past, most regional maritime exercises in the IOR were bilateral
and essentially between Navies, with the inclusion of carrier-based air
assets and integral ship-borne air power elements, while regional Air
Forces carried out their air exercises independently.

Traditionally, regional maritime exercises in the IOR primarily involved
bilateral engagements between navies, with limited involvement of
carrier-based air assets and integral ship-borne airpower elements.
Transitioning toward a more integrated approach that combines the
strengths of land-based airpower with aerial refueling and
forward-staging capabilities is essential for enhancing regional
security.

Likewise, the collaborative efforts of regional stakeholders to
counteract potential threats in the domains of space and cyber present
significant opportunities. Adopting an inclusive, all-domain approach
involving the Quad and other multilateral engagements is essential for
promoting stability and security. This approach aligns with the
principles of equal access enshrined in international law, emphasizing
the importance of freedom of navigation, unimpeded commerce, and
peaceful dispute resolution in common spaces across sea and air
domains.\[71\] Expanding beyond existing bilateral and multilateral
maritime and air exercises, joint multination exercises that capitalize
on the diverse military capabilities of all participants are crucial for
enhancing security in the Indo-Pacific and IOR.

In 2018, Prime Minister Modi expressed a firm stance: "We will work with
others to keep our seas, space, and airways free and open; our nations
secure from terrorism; and our cyber space free from disruption and
conflict."\[72\] This belief creates an opportunity to develop a novel
cooperative regional security framework involving all regional
stakeholders and those with vested interests. This shared vision aims to
foster an Indo-Pacific that is open, stable, secure, and prosperous for
all.\[73\]

End Thoughts

As the world's most populous democracy and the second-largest nation in
Asia, India's economic and rising power trajectory inevitably positions
it to either compete or contend with China's Zhōngguó dream. The legacy
of unresolved border issues and past wars with China and Pakistan, who
share a strategic friendship and pose threats to India's rise, create an
uncertain geopolitical future. Beijing's ambitions and Islamabad's
economic and political instability leave India caught between
continental security threats and maritime strategic interests. In the
past, these two realms were mutually exclusive, but with China's
expanding territorial and maritime
reach, **[India]{.underline}** [must]{.underline} now **[balance]{.underline}** the **[sovereignty]{.underline}** of
its land borders [with]{.underline} the [freedom

[The]{.underline} **[strategic]{.underline}** **[nexus]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Indian

to]{.underline} **[exert
influence]{.underline}** [across]{.underline} **[all
domains]{.underline}**, including space. A collaborative approach among
nations committed to the security and stability of the broader
Indo-Pacific region offers the most promising path
forward. [India's]{.underline} [future]{.underline} **[strategic]{.underline}** **[interests]{.underline}** [position

boundaries between land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains, as well as
their growing interconnectivity and interdependence, the domain-centric
approach of the past will limit future outlooks and options. Effectively
countering China's comprehensive security and strategic approach
requires all stakeholders to leverage their respective domain strengths
and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach across multiple
domains and contested spaces.

probable given regional dynamics.**

[In Asia]{.underline} and the Pacific, the bigger limitation of [the
NPT]{.underline} as one of the two global normative frameworks is that
its legal obligations in turn [do not apply to]{.underline} at least two
and possibly three of Asia's four possessor states. China is the only
Asian nuclear-weapon state (NWS) under the NPT. [India and
Pakistan]{.underline} never signed it and have always opposed it and are
consequently free of any legal obligations under the NPT. North Korea
used to be a non-NWS State Party but withdrew early in this century and
has since conducted several nuclear and missile tests and is believed to
have acquired a modest arsenal of nuclear warheads along with short
range, medium range and intercontinental ballistic missile delivery
systems. Although its legal status with respect to the NPT remains
disputed, in practice it has defected from the global nonproliferation
regime.

[There is no]{.underline} extant over-arching [security architecture

possibility of]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [nuclear war]{.underline},
either by design or, more likely, by accident through human or system
error, **[is]{.underline}** small but **[real]{.underline}**. To take
but one example, unlike the role of nuclear-armed submarines as
strategic stabilizers in the US--Russia equation, in Asia the race to
attain continuous at-sea deterrence capability through nuclear-armed
submarines is potentially quite destabilizing. The [Asian powers lack
well-developed operational concepts, robust and redundant
command-and-control systems]{.underline} and secure communications over
submarines at sea. State-sponsored cross-border militancy and extremism
involving nuclear-armed states is another local reality, as is the fear
of nuclear terrorism. Unlike the Cold War practice of strategic nuclear
policy dialogues firstly among the United States and its allies, and
secondly between the US allies and the Soviet Union, no equivalent
dialogues exist in Asia and the Pacific either among allies or between
adversaries. While there have been some episodic dialogues between India
and Pakistan they have not been sustained. Besides, no such dialogue has
occurred between China and India.

[The geostrategic environment of Southern Asia had no parallel in the
Cold War,]{.underline} **[with]{.underline}** [**shared borders**,
major]{.underline} [**territorial disputes**, history
of]{.underline} many [wars]{.underline} since 1947, **[compressed
timeframes]{.underline}** [for using or losing nuclear weapons, and
political volatility]{.underline} [and instability]{.underline}. The
subcontinental rivalry is not free of the risk of a nuclear exchange
triggered by acts of terror committed on Indian territory by individuals
and groups linked to networks across the border in Pakistan.
Moreover, [each party will feel more insecure with every increase in the
other's]{.underline} [**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline} [stockpiles
and capabilities]{.underline}. China does not view India as a
significant military threat (Dalton and Zhao Citation2020), is
dismissive of India's great power pretensions, holds India's (and
Pakistan's) possession of nuclear weapons to be illegitimate and argues
the programme should be rolled back because it was done outside the NPT,
and expects the military-nuclear power gap between them to grow rather
than narrow.

[Even a limited regional nuclear war]{.underline} [between India and
Pakistan]{.underline} involving the use of 100 Hiroshima-size (15kt)
bombs in total [could]{.underline} [cause]{.underline} a global famine
through **[nuclear]{.underline}** **[winter]{.underline}** effects that
destroy crop production, disrupt global food distribution networks and
over a decade kill up to two billion people (International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War Citation2022). Premeditated nuclear
strikes are unlikely pathways to a nuclear exchange between any two or
all three of China--India--Pakistan. But [the toxic cocktail of
growing]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline} [stockpiles, expanding
weapon]{.underline} [platforms]{.underline} (both nuclear and advanced
conventional), **[irredentist territorial claims]{.underline}**, out of

linkages makes the China--India--Pakistan nuclear chain
a]{.underline} **[high-risk and high-impact]{.underline}** [geopolitical
equation]{.underline}.

Three high-profile events in the last few years have sounded ominous
warnings. First, in mid-2017 China and India faced each other in a tense
military confrontation at the tri-junction with Bhutan in the Doklam
plateau for well over a month (Thakur Citation2017). In February 2019, a
suicide bomber, allegedly inspired, trained and controlled by
state-linked handlers in Pakistan, blew up a paramilitary convoy in
Kashmir killing several soldiers. India retaliated by launching strikes
deep inside Pakistan proper (that is, beyond Kashmir). Pakistan sent
warplanes over Indian airspace and in the resulting dogfight, an Indian
fighter plane was shot down and its pilot captured but swiftly returned.
This was the first instance in the world where two nuclear-armed states
had engaged in air strikes and aerial dogfights (Thakur Citation2019).
Third, in June 2020, Chinese and Indian military forces engaged in
hand-to-hand combat in Galwan, high in the Ladakh mountains near the
strategic tri-junction of China, India and Pakistan (Thakur
Citation2020). Around 20 Indian and an unknown number of Chinese
soldiers were killed. Simultaneously India experienced cyber-attacks,
reportedly emanating from China, on critical infrastructure. The 2020
China--India conflict was the biggest loss of military life resulting
from a direct clash between two nuclear-armed states since the
Amur-Ussuri clashes between the former Soviet Union and China in 1969.
It was also the deadliest clash between China and India since their 1962
war and there is no evidence that the Galwan crisis has been defused
(Singh Citation2022). Indeed, there are indications that both sides are
digging in for the long haul.

[Geopolitical tensions in Asia are thus characterized by]{.underline} a
multiplicity of nuclear powers with criss-crossing ties of cooperation
and conflict, the [fragility of command-and-control systems, threat
perceptions between three or more nuclear-armed states simultaneously
and a more complex array of deterrence relations]{.underline} between
regional and global nuclear-armed states. Asia's strategic environment
includes major asymmetries and the role of nuclear weapons in the
overall security calculus has been changing. In addition, new
technologies such as cyberwarfare, space-based dual use systems and
autonomous weapons systems using artificial intelligence are introducing
fresh instabilities as are the roles of "grey-zone" operations and those
of non-state actors. All this is a challenge for arms control
negotiators: simple, number-counting warhead reductions no longer work
because it is necessary to look at the wider calculus of security
imbalances. Clearly [the region suffers from trust
deficits]{.underline} [in key relations.]{.underline} [Its actors

### N/UQ

#### Commitment fails now---resources are stretched thin. 

**Levantovscaia 24** \[Kathryn Levantovscaia, Deputy Director of the
Forward Defense program at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security, 01/05/24, Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/overstretched-and-undersupplied-can-the-us-afford-its-global-security-blanket/\]
A.N.

In recent decades, US foreign policy has been beset by visions of the
United States ensuring security throughout much of the world, but with
little thought to the resources or resolve required or the second-order
consequences. One would do well to remember the words of British writer
Aldous Huxley: "good ends . . . can be achieved only by the employment
of appropriate means." This notion is specifically relevant when
reflecting on the US defense ecosystem---one bearing an industrial base
that had struggled to meet capacity long before conflict erupted in
Ukraine and Israel in recent years. While maintaining regional stability
across the globe is critical to US defense and national security
objectives, simultaneously supplying major arms packages to Israel and
Ukraine, at a time when the United States needs to prepare for the
possibility of armed conflict with China, will stretch production lines
and resources beyond sustainable limits, potentially jeopardizing all
US-supported efforts. Recently, the US response to conflict in the
Middle East and to Russia's war in Ukraine has brought to light growing
concerns about US defense industrial capacity and about the spectrum of
security cooperation the United States deploys. Limited resources within
the Department of Defense are polarizing debates in Washington and
beyond about which country needs help more: Israel or Ukraine? The real
answer is less simple than one or the other. While maintaining Israel's
and Ukraine's sovereignty are both critical to US national security
objectives, the size of the United States' involvement in helping each
could, in turn, gamble with many of the same security objectives. The
hollowing out of the broader US manufacturing base has made defense
companies dependent on supply chains originating in, of all places,
China. The capabilities needed in Ukraine, Israel, and a potential
conflict with China vary, which prompts many US commentators to argue
that the United States can sustain all three. However, that presumption
undermines alarms raised across the federal government. Both the
administration and the Department of Defense have highlighted their
concerns about vulnerabilities resulting from a dependence on a
shrinking number of sub-tier providers and the disruption on US defense
supply chains caused by geopolitical instability. **[[US defense
industries are wheezing in]{.mark} fundamental categories of [weapons
production]{.mark}. Several [decades of inadequate defense
budgets]{.mark} compounded with poor management of major Department of
Defense acquisition programs has [left the nation with a force]{.mark}
whose inventory of vital weapons is [smaller, older, and less ready for
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The hollowing out of the broader US
manufacturing base has made defense companies dependent on supply chains
originating in, of all places, China. From electronic components to
gallium, Chinese companies export unconscionable percentages of
indispensable subcomponents and materials on which US production lines
depend. To put this into perspective, US stocks of precision-guided
munitions are perilously low. If the United States were to engage in a
Pacific conflict, the US military would run out of these munitions
within three to ten days. Meanwhile, Israel is in an existential fight,
running through its inadequate weapons reserves as Ukraine commands
\$44.2 billion to date in US military assistance just to stay afloat.
Frankly put, the US defense industrial base is a fraction of what it was
when the United States codified commitments to Israel. Despite the
immense strain on domestic manufacturing capacity, Washington continues
to put greater investment in mounting commitments abroad than in the
health of the US industrial base. There are no plans in place for a
major expansion nor the significant budget increases required. Make no
mistake, this does not call for the abandonment of Ukraine or Israel.
Ukraine is a critical regional strategic partner whose territorial
integrity is key to both US and international security. Further,
allowing Ukraine to fight Russia is arguably a more favorable
alternative than forcing NATO to do so. On a similar token, US support
to Israel emerged not in a flash, but from decades of step-by-step
US-Israel alliance building and consideration of the dilemma created by
the United States selling weapons to Arab states. Israel has been the
cornerstone of US strategy in the Middle East since the Cold War, and as
the leading Western influence in the region, the United States relies
heavily on Israel's sustained and protected existence. Regardless,
careful mind must be paid to the true cost of US security commitments
and their impact on longstanding partnerships and alliances. Moving into
an election year in the United States, a rise in exports of US military
assistance while the domestic defense ecosystem withers could reignite
skepticism and scrutiny among key US decision makers toward NATO.
Reverting back to the previous administration's disdain for
multilateralism risks bringing down the entire security edifice that US
statesmen erected in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East during the
twentieth century. Prioritizing US strength helps US allies and partners
While US leadership is critical, mounting world crises require a
division of labor among allies. The United States carries the
overwhelming load, and the US warfighter is dangerously stretched---so
much so that the military's standards for new recruits dropped
significantly last year in a desperate attempt to fill ranks. Retainment
is at an all-time low. China and Iran know it; hence, their galling
military provocations from Taiwan to the Red Sea. US armed forces may be
the strongest in the world, yet they are too small to handle the
country's many commitments abroad. As European allies continue to step
up their support to Ukraine, the United States should take this pivotal
opportunity to reinvest and rebuild US manufacturing prowess. The United
States prioritizing its own strength is the only sustainable path to
support Ukraine and uphold every other commitment made by the country to
allies and partners. US leaders and policymakers should be unwavering in
their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty. But in order to provide
security assistance responsibly, they must first ensure a robust and
well-resourced US defense industrial base, guaranteeing the United
States' long-term ability to support allies and partners while deterring
adversaries. NATO allies collectively enjoy an economy in excess of
forty trillion dollars, top-tier military technologies, and a surplus of
F-16 fighter jets, which, if provided in number, could make a large
difference in Ukraine's objective of recapturing its territory.
Europeans not only have the fighter-bombers, but also the complex
logistical and training networks to get Ukrainian pilots in the air
quickly and create conditions for breaking the current stalemate.
Decisions like these, however, require alignment on both sides of the
pond. The US administration only recently provided the green light for
Europe to provide Ukraine's pilots with F-16 aircraft and training,
which Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall deemed a key capability for
Ukraine's long-term defense. Pursuing regional stability in Europe and
the Middle East simultaneously are critical and costly endeavors. Doing
so at the current pace in light of capacity limitations could backfire
and damage not only Ukraine but also NATO. At the same time, the United
States lacks the requisite focus to take on a Chinese threat to Taiwan
and to defend its Pacific position because the US military and defense
industrial base are stretched thin. This problem must be addressed
now---a time when the United States' European allies' continued support
for Ukraine affords the opportunity to do so. **[In short, the United
States faces a strategic choice[. Its means are insufficient to achieve
its ends]{.mark}. To close the gap, it must move one or the
other.]{.underline}** Bringing the ends closer to the current means can
be done in part by reassessing US commitments abroad. US policymakers
should conduct a thorough review of current US security commitments,
evaluating their strategic importance and resource demands, and scaling
back involvement in certain regions to prioritize critical threats where
necessary. It will be difficult work, which will include building a
widely shared US political consensus on prioritizing among the
considerable dangers existing in disparate parts of the world. Bringing
the means closer to the current ends also presents a challenge, namely
the US Congress appropriating more funding. And to keep this funding
"appropriate" in the eyes of Americans, US political leaders need to
foster great unity on the United States' international role and
strategic priorities. Transparency and enhanced visibility on the
current limitations of US industrial capacity and the cost of
maintaining the current security architecture is vital to sustain
Western leadership. As the White House and Congress begin work on a
budget for 2025, a first step they could take is to prioritize a
domestic resurgence of the US industrial base. The United States needs
an additional three hundred billion dollars in the annual defense budget
directed toward revitalizing the US defense industrial base, by
expanding capacity and diversifying supply chains to eliminate
dependence on volatile foreign sources. This requires a significant
budget increase and commitment to long-term rebuilding. (MJM)

[[The]{.mark} new Icebreaker Collaboration Effort ([ICE
Pact]{.mark})]{.underline} between Canada, Finland and the U S
[[spotlights the stakes at play for Indo-Pacific
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} amid the increasing focus on flexible
minilaterals; increasingly global and cross-regional conversation
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} areas like [[the Arctic]{.underline};]{.mark}
as well as intensified great power competition.

First, the ICE Pact highlighted the increasing role of flexible
minilaterals in how countries are working together across strategic
spaces and sectors. [Indo-Pacific countries have been at the heart of
this in recent years]{.underline} within US policy, whether it be
through global, sector-based institutions like the Minerals Security
Partnership or region-specific ones like the Quad and the more recent
"Squad" (US, Australia, Japan, Philippines). While [the ICE Pact
is]{.underline} initially between three countries, US officials have
privately said they see this as [part of a broader conversation
involving]{.underline} a wider range of like-minded [states [about how
to meet global needs for strategic capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
including icebreakers as well as shipbuilding capacity and workforce
expertise.

Second, the ICE Pact is the latest datapoint in the increasingly global
and cross-regional nature of geopolitical conversations, including in
the Arctic Region. The context within which it was announced was on the
sidelines of the NATO summit, where [four of NATO's Indo-Pacific
partners]{.underline} (IPP or IP4) -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and
South Korea -- [attended]{.underline} for the third consecutive time.
While the ICE Pact itself has an Arctic focus and initially groups three
countries in North America and Europe, it is worth noting that [Artic
conversations too are gradually becoming more global]{.underline}. To
take just one example, the Arctic Council organized its first-ever Japan
Forum last year on Asia's role in the future of the Arctic in a
closely-watched region-specific development. [Asia's
presence]{.underline} at the Council [has long been
evident]{.underline}, with five of the thirteen observer states being
from Asia -- China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.

Third, [the ICE Pact also spotlighted [intensifying great power
competition,]{.mark} which [has implications for Indo-Pacific
countries]{.mark} as well. The ICE Pact comes amid increasing concerns
by US policymakers about Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic and the
glaring gap in polar icebreaking fleet capabilities. [Asian
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} may not be Arctic countries, but they
[[are aware that a]{.mark} more [contested Arctic could
exacerbate]{.mark} concerns about]{.underline} major power
[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} and [the behavior [of China and
Russia]{.mark} evident in the South China Sea and with the Ukraine
invasion]{.underline}. Developments like melting Arctic ice sheets could
also shift the patterns of international trade amid concerns around
climate change and opportunities in shipping or science. [Those stakes
explain why we have seen expressions of Arctic interest among some key
Indo-Pacific countries, including non-US treaty allies]{.underline}. For
instance, in South Asia, India released a designated Arctic policy. In
Southeast Asia, Singapore has been playing up its expertise across
domains such as disaster preparedness, maritime infrastructure and
environmental research.
