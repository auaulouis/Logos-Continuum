**[[China's]{.mark} strategic use of rare earths as an economic
weapon]{.underline}** may offer short-term leverage, but it can **[[run
into risks]{.mark} in the long run]{.underline}**. China may be
controlling the present of rare earths, but it may not control their
future. The myth of rarity of rare earths. The term "rare earth
elements" (REEs) is a misnomer. Comprising 17 metallic
elements---including neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium---these
materials are relatively abundant in the Earth\'s crust. Cerium, for
example, is more common than copper. What makes them "rare" is the
difficulty in finding them in economically viable concentrations and the
even greater challenge of separating them from each other, as they tend
to occur in clusters. Commercial deposits are spread across the
globe---from Australia and the U.S. to India, Brazil, and parts of
Africa. Yet, almost all of global rare earth refining still happens in
China. This isn't due to a lack of resources elsewhere; it\'s the result
of decades of strategic policy decisions by Beijing and complacency from
the rest of the world. How China monopolised rare earths China's
dominance in the rare earth industry is not geological \-- it is
geopolitical. Beginning in the 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s,
China deliberately cultivated rare earth mining and refining as a
strategic industry. It offered subsidies, low-cost loans and lax
environmental regulations, allowing it to undercut Western producers who
were burdened by stricter standards and higher costs. By the early
2000s, China had effectively driven many competitors out of business.
The Mountain Pass mine in California, once the world\'s leading rare
earth producer, was shuttered in 2002 due to both economic and
environmental pressures. This left China not only as the dominant
supplier of rare earth elements but also as the global refinery for
turning them into usable materials for magnets, batteries, and
electronics. In effect, China monopolized the middle and downstream
segments of the value chain---where the true economic and strategic
value lies. Refining and processing, not mining, is where pricing power,
technological influence, and geopolitical leverage are concentrated.
[**China\'s [rare earths move can backfire]{.mark}.** Since many
countries have rare earths deposits as well as the capability to refine
them, [China\'s gambling]{.mark} on a rare leverage it has on the
world.]{.underline} It can use it sparingly and then step back but a
hard stance will only cost it dearly. By restricting rare earth exports,
China aims to pressure foreign industries and governments, especially
those pushing back against its strategic and technological ambitions.
This tactic, however, is not without risks. Firstly, this
[[weaponization]{.mark} creates powerful [incentives for]{.mark} other
[countries to invest in]{.mark} their [own rare earth
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[US, Europe, Japan, Australia
and India]{.mark} have already begun allocating significant resources to
rebuild rare earth supply chains]{.underline}. Australia's Lynas Rare
Earths has ramped up production, and the [US government]{.underline} has
designated rare earths as critical minerals, [channeling funding toward
domestic refining capabilities]{.underline}. **[India is expediting
steps to boost domestic availability of critical
minerals]{.underline}**. Changes to the Mines and Minerals (Development
and Regulation) Act are being fast-tracked. Besides regulatory tweaks,
the centre is also expecting commercially viable domestic production of
rare earth permanent magnets in small quantities later this year. After
the fourth meeting of the India-Central Asia Dialogue held in New Delhi
last week, India and five central Asian countries have expressed
interest in joint exploration of rare earths and critical minerals.
India is also working on alternate sources for magnets derived from rare
earth minerals, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said while
speaking to reporters in Germany a few days ago. [\"In a way, it\'s a
[wake-up call for]{.mark} all [those]{.mark} who have become
[over-reliant on]{.mark} certain [geographies]{.mark}. It\'s a wake-up
call for the whole world that you [need trusted partners]{.mark} in your
supply chain,]{.underline}" the minister said. On alternative sources,
the minister said these could also be some technologies that India is
developing. \"The government, the industry and startups and innovators
are all working as a team and we are confident that there may be a
problem in the short run but we will emerge winners in the mid to long
runs,\" he said. China\'s move will surely accelerate innovation in
material science. **[[Companies]{.mark} are [increasingly
investing]{.mark} in rare-earth-free alternatives,]{.underline}** such
as ferrite magnets or advanced electric motor designs that reduce or
eliminate the need for REEs. [Long-term, this could [shrink global
dependence on rare earths]{.mark} altogether, [diminishing China's
leverage]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once [other countries begin producing
their own rare earths and developed technology to produce
magnets]{.underline} as well [as alternatives]{.underline},
[[China]{.mark} will start [losing export markets]{.mark} and also its
leverage on other countries.]{.underline} Much of its rare earth
industry is export-oriented, particularly in the high-value-added
processing and magnet manufacturing sectors. As buyers diversify or
localize supply chains**[, [Chinese]{.mark} producers could find
themselves [facing overcapacity]{.mark} and [declining global
relevance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The current disruption may well be a
turning point. What is happening is not just a scramble for resources,
but a deeper strategic pivot. **[Countries]{.underline}** are beginning
to **[view rare earths]{.underline}** not as a commodity, but **[as a
national security asset]{.underline}**. Governments are deploying
industrial policy, economic incentives and international cooperation to
ensure secure and sustainable access. In the short term, China's
dominance in refining will continue to cause pain for sectors dependent
on these inputs such as electric vehicles. But in the medium to long
term, the very **[act of leveraging this dominance could cause its
erosion.]{.underline}** [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} rare earth
[[monopoly]{.mark} will [fracture]{.mark} under the weight of its own
power play.]{.underline} It\'s possible that China soon eases export
curbs since it knows the risk of overplaying its hand. But the world has
realised China\'s intent to weaponize critical supply chains and it will
keep trying to break its China dependence.

#### China dominance threat is overblown 

**The Economist 19** ("Rare earths give China leverage in the trade war,
at a cost," The Economist, 6-15-2019,
https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/15/rare-earths-give-china-leverage-in-the-trade-war-at-a-cost-)-MZ

This is why rare earths now figure in the trade war. America can hobble
Chinese tech giants by stopping American firms from selling them
components such as semiconductors. But China could, in return, cut off
their supplies of rare-earth products. The most important of these are
specialised magnets for motors in electric vehicles, generators in wind
turbines and missile-guidance systems. China produces more than 90% of
the world's output, according to Citigroup, a bank. [Even the Pentagon,
through its suppliers, is a client.]{.underline}
**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** rare-earth **[[power]{.mark} is [not
a new worry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2010 it restricted exports---in
order, it said, to protect its environment. The [[W]{.mark}orld
[T]{.mark}rade [O]{.mark}rganisation [ruled against]{.mark} the
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} after America and others challenged
them. But since then many countries have [fretted about relying on
China]{.underline}. So it is no surprise that in the past few weeks
**[China has brandished rare earths as a possible weapon.]{.underline}**
**[State [media]{.mark}]{.underline}** have [**[played up the
threat]{.underline}**.]{.mark} "China gears up to use rare-earth
advantage" ran a headline in Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, on
June 9th. But doing so is not so simple. After the scare in 2010 Japan
lent money to Lynas, an Australian mining company with a refinery in
Malaysia. Today, it **[can meet nearly a third of]{.underline}**
**[Japanese demand for rare earths]{.underline}**. The **[[Mountain Pass
mine]{.mark} in California]{.underline}**, which once [[supplied
most]{.mark} of the world's [rare earths]{.mark}]{.underline} but which
shut in the early 2000s, has [[reopened]{.underline}]{.mark}. And on
June 11th **[America said]{.underline}** it would **[[help other
countries]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark} their
[reserves]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
share of **[global rare-earth [production fell]{.mark}]{.underline}**
from **[[more than 95]{.mark}%]{.underline}** in 2010 **[[to
70%]{.mark}]{.underline}** last year, and is [[likely]{.mark} to [dip
lower]{.mark} (see chart]{.underline}). [A rare gift China has much more
leverage in downstream products.]{.underline} **[[America]{.mark} last
year [bought]{.mark} about [\$250m of rare-earth]{.mark} magnets [from
China,]{.mark} and there are [no easy alternative]{.mark}
sources.]{.underline}** "These magnets are the farthest thing from a
commodity that we can imagine," says Ryan Castilloux, of Adamas
Intelligence, a rare-earths consultancy. They are made to exact
specifications. And, says Mr Castilloux, the industry is small enough
for China to be able to spot any American attempts to skirt a Chinese
ban by importing magnets through other countries. The
**[[Pentagon]{.underline}]{.mark}** would probably **[[be able to
cope]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An industry joke has it that it can carry
its annual supply of heavy rare earths (the kind used in its missiles)
in a single suitcase. Businesses would find it harder. David Merriman of
Roskill, a metals research firm, says it would disrupt the supply chain
enough to put American car companies "at a competitive disadvantage".
But it is [[far from certain]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} will [block
exports to America]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Doing so would also [hurt
Chinese companies]{.mark}, which are often the ones that build the
motors and batteries for American customers using rare-earth
magnets.]{.underline} Longer term, **[a ban would
[encourage]{.mark}]{.underline}** the same process that happened in
mining**[. [Foreign firms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, perhaps with
government support, will **[invest in facilities to make finished
products.]{.underline}** That would [[set back China's]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark} for rare earths]{.underline}, seen in the hills around
Ganzhou. Over the past few years it has **[[shut]{.mark} scores
of]{.underline}** unlicensed **[[mines]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[At a
huge cost, it is trying to clean up local rivers.]{.underline}** The big
state-owned mining firm in the area has started filling in some of its
pits with grass and shrubs. China is still excavating plenty of
rare-earth elements, especially in the north, but it has decided that it
can buy much of what it needs abroad, and spare its own environment.
Last year, it became a net importer of rare-earth concentrate. Instead,
China has shifted its focus to rare-earth products, to increase its
downstream advantage. In an industrial park on the edge of Ganzhou, the
government is ploughing money into factories that make rare-earth
magnets and alloys. This manufacturing is much cleaner than the mining,
and captures more value. Tellingly, when Xi Jinping, China's president,
visited the city last month, news reports showed him at JL MAG, a magnet
company, not a mine. At another company in Ganzhou, a manager shows off
several of its products: little disc magnets, each containing about 30%
rare earths. When the magnets are smaller than a fingernail, it is hard
to pull them apart. When they are slightly bigger, just wider than a
thumb, it is impossible to do so. That is a good metaphor for what
[China ultimately wants from rare earths, and for its economy more
generally: to reach a size where no country, not even America, can pull
away. [Cutting America off]{.mark} now would [undercut]{.mark} that
[ambition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### REMs Not Key

As trade tensions rise between the U.S. and China, [rare earth minerals
are]{.underline} [once again]{.underline} [in the political
spotlight]{.underline}. Today [Chinese mines]{.underline} [and
processing facilities]{.underline} [provide most]{.underline} [of the
world\'s supply, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hinted about using
this as political leverage in trade negotiations]{.underline} with U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s administration. But in the long run, many
experts say the global market involving these materials would likely
survive even if China completely stopped exporting them. The 17 rare
earth elements, which cluster near the bottom of the periodic table,
play a vital role in several industries: consumer electronics including
Apple AirPods and iPhones, green technologies such as General Electric
wind turbines and Tesla electric cars, medical tools including Philips
Healthcare scanners, and military hardware such as F-35 jet fighters.
The U.S. government lists them among minerals deemed critical to the
country\'s economic and national security, and the Trump administration
notably exempted rare earth elements from tariffs it imposed on \$300
billion worth of Chinese goods. On the other side of the trade conflict,
Xi recently made a politically symbolic visit to one of China\'s main
rare earth mining and processing facilities, and China used tariffs of
its own to target a U.S. rare earth mine in
California. **[Such]{.underline}** **[political]{.underline}** **[posturing]{.underline}** **[on
both sides, however,]{.underline}** **[may overemphasize the world\'s
reliance on China\'s supply of rare earth
elements.]{.underline}** \"**[Politicians get too
alarmed]{.underline}** **[or too wrapped up in the idea of political
manipulation of markets]{.underline}**,\" says Eugene Gholz, an
associate professor of political science at the University of Notre
Dame. \"[There\'s a big difference between individual companies making
or losing money, and the large-scale ability to get political influence
in this particular market.\"]{.underline} **[The
\"rare\"]{.underline}** **[in the name of this group of
elements]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[actually
somewhat]{.underline}** **[misleading]{.underline}**; the [U.S.
Geological Survey describes them as \"relatively
abundant]{.underline} [in the Earth\'s crust]{.underline}.\" But
extraction is complicated by the fact that in the ground, such elements
are jumbled together with many other minerals in different
concentrations. The raw ores go through a first round of processing to
produce concentrates, which head to another facility where high-purity
rare earth elements are isolated. Such facilities perform complex
chemical processes that most commonly involve a procedure called solvent
extraction, in which the dissolved materials go through hundreds of
liquid-containing chambers that separate individual elements or
compounds---steps that may be repeated hundreds or even thousands of
times. Once purified, they can be processed into oxides, phosphors,
metals, alloys and magnets that take advantage of these elements\'
unique magnetic, luminescent or electrochemical properties. The strong
and lightweight nature of rare earth magnets, metals and alloys have
made them especially valuable in high-tech
products. [China]{.underline} [currently has most of the
world\'s]{.underline} [separation facilities---but if it
ever]{.underline} [were to stop]{.underline} [exporting the purified
materials,]{.underline} **[other options exist]{.underline}**. In the
short term, [U.S. companies]{.underline} [that rely on these
minerals]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [likely have
inventory]{.underline} [stockpiles for brief supply
shortages]{.underline}, Gholz says, who served from 2010 to 2012 as
senior advisor to the Pentagon\'s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy. [To stretch those
stockpiles out,]{.underline} [the overall market could prioritize rare
earth elements for crucial applications]{.underline} [such as military
and medical technologies]{.underline}, while forcing makers of
headphones or golf bags to pay more. \"**[I don\'t think there is an
obvious supply gap or hole where someone will not be able to get a Prius
or Tesla or whatever they\'re looking at]{.underline}**,\" Gholz
says. **[In the event of a longer Chinese supply interruption, the
U.S.]{.underline}** **[rare earths mine at Mountain Pass,
Calif.,]{.underline}** **[would likely become the first place to step up
production]{.underline}**, Gholz explains. The mine\'s previous owner,
Molycorp, spent approximately \$1.5 billion building a new separation
facility for producing rare earth concentrates. It did not, however,
complete the downstream processing needed to produce purified rare earth
materials before the company went bankrupt in 2015 because of Chinese
competition. [The mine\'s new owner, MP Materials, plans to reactivate
and complete the mothballed facility for fresh operation starting in
2020.]{.underline} **[Another alternative is Australian company Lynas
Corp]{.underline}**., the world\'s only significant rare earths producer
outside China. [It currently operates a mine at Mount Weld in Australia,
and sends ores to a separation facility in Malaysia that can purify the
rare earth materials---but a complication has arisen from the fact that
some ores contain radioactive thorium.]{.underline}Environmental
concerns about low-level radioactive waste from the separation facility
recently led Lynas to announce it will move some some of the
\"upstream\" processing (which involves the radioactivity) back to
Australia, while keeping \"downstream\" processing in Malaysia. [The
company has also announced it will work with Texas-based Blue Line Corp.
to build a new separation facility in the U.S. for operations starting
in 2022 at the earliest.]{.underline}

### China Leadership Solves Warming

#### Chinese leadership is key to [global climate mitigation]{.underline}

**Hare** 11-6-20**24**, physicist and climate scientist, is the chief
executive of Climate Analytics (Bill, "Donald Trump can't stop global
climate action. If we stick together, it's the US that will lose out,"
The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/donald-trump-cant-stop-global-climate-action-if-we-stick-together-its-the-us-that-will-lose-out)

Donald [[Trump's re-election]{.underline}]{.mark} to the White House
[[is a]{.mark} major [setback for climate]{.mark} action
**[but]{.mark}** ultimately [it's the US that could end up losing
out]{.mark}, as [the **rest of the world will move forward** without
it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The US is the world's biggest economy and its second biggest emitter.
Positive US engagement on climate has been crucial to landmark leaps
forward, like getting the Paris agreement over the line, and just last
year committing to transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The US missing in action in the latter half of this critical decade for
climate action is nobody's idea of a good outcome.

President-elect Trump has promised to leave the Paris agreement and
reports have emerged that he could be thinking of pulling out of the
underlying United Nations framework treaty on climate change. But we've
been here before and the truth is that a second
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} presidency [[can't stop]{.mark} [climate
action]{.mark}]{.underline}, just like his denial of human-induced
climate change won't spare the US from its impacts.

[[The energy transition is]{.mark} now well [under way. The economics of
renewable]{.mark} technologie[s are]{.mark} so [attractive]{.mark} that
they have become an energy juggernaut]{.underline}. Since the Paris
agreement was signed in 2015, global investment in clean energy has
increased by 60%.

Nearly US\$2tn a year is now invested in clean energy projects, almost
double that spent on new oil, gas and coal supply. Before the pandemic,
this ratio was closer to 1:1. The US added 560 gigawatts of renewable
capacity in 2023. That's about six times the size of Australia's entire
electricity capacity, added in just one year.

Domestically, Joe Biden's **[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nflation
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**eduction **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct has
[[set wheels in motion for climate investment that will be]{.mark} hard,
and politically [unpopular, to undo]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Famously, no Republicans voted for the legislation but red states have
been the main beneficiaries of the money, projects and jobs it has
created. House Republicans have even pushed back against their peers to
protect some of the act's clean energy tax credits.

Climate impacts are accelerating in pace and scale that is untenable to
ignore. Hurricanes Helene and Milton, supercharged by climate change,
are expected to cost more than US\$50bn. Fires in California, heatwaves
in the sunbelt states, and flooding in the US South are wreaking huge
damage on Americans. Last year a poll showed a majority of them feel
that climate change is already causing serious effects.

**[[None of this stops the day Trump re-enters]{.mark} the White
House]{.underline}**.

Internationally, we've been in this position before. In 2001 George W
Bush quit the 1997 Kyoto deal. Last time Trump was in power, he left the
Paris agreement, albeit for a short time. [I don't want to
downplay]{.underline} the impacts of **[Trump]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline} the **[Project 2025]{.underline}** agenda to which he
has been linked, [but [climate action didn't stop then and it will not
stop now]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[Other players, notably China, are]{.mark} increasingly [moving into
a leadership position]{.mark} on the issue]{.underline}**, [because of
the strategic policy and economic interests it advances]{.underline}.
The European Union is moving ahead with its green economic development
agenda despite a rightward shift in the balance of power across the EU27
-- with action on the climate emergency driving the economic development
needed for this region of 350 million people.

The US, if Trump does enact the changes he has campaigned on, will find
itself falling behind on new technologies and markets.

How damaging the second Trump presidency is to climate action depends
very much on how other countries react. If many follow Trump in either
rolling back -- or slowing down -- their action, the damage will be
severe, long-lasting and difficult to overcome.

On the other hand, [if countries]{.underline} stick together and, as
they should, [deepen their commitments]{.underline} aligning with the
Paris agreement's 1.5C limit, the **[[damage will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** significant but **[[not
severe]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Since ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2015, [[China has established
itself as a major player in]{.underline}]{.mark} the global
[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} policy arena. Along with anti-corruption
initiatives, governance reform, and national security plans, President
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [has [made
climate]{.mark}]{.underline} change and sustainable development [[a top
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under Xi's direction, [China has
established itself as a **pioneer**]{.underline} [in green development
worldwide]{.underline}, pledging to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and
peak carbon emissions by 2030.

[[China's pledge to achieve carbon neutrality]{.underline}]{.mark} by
2060 [[highlights its]{.underline} **[strategic influence]{.underline}**
[in determining]{.underline} **[international environmental
regulations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and promoting sustainable]{.mark}
development [programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. President [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping [has reaffirmed China's commitment to combating]{.underline}
global [climate change]{.underline} on several international forums.
According to him, China "will stay firmly on the path of green
development and continue to be an important force for global green
transition." He made this declaration at the APEC CEO Summit in November
2024.

At the World Leaders Climate Action Summit 2024, Chinese Vice Premier
Ding Xuexiang also declared that "China will work with all parties to
uphold the vision of building a community with a shared future for
mankind, make concerted efforts to protect Earth, our common home, and
jointly build a clean and beautiful world."

[[China has transformed]{.underline}]{.mark} over time
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[helpless bystander
to]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[accountable world

and second-largest economy, [China has deliberately positioned itself at
the vanguard of international environmental diplomacy]{.underline},
[using its economic clout]{.underline} [and policy initiatives to shape
global climate governance]{.underline}. To promote a just and equitable
transition, China has been pushing to strengthen South-South
cooperation, increase the role of poor nations in climate
decision-making, and connect climate measures with economic growth.

### No Hegemony Impact

#### Retrenchment is sustainable, no revisionist expansion, and balancing solves

peril of great power retrenchment: Types of strategic withdrawals and
their consequences. European Journal of International Security.
Published online 2024:1-19. doi:10.1017/eis.2024.43)//Mac KP

Reassessing retrenchment's consequences With this more refined
understanding of retrenchment in hand, we can now turn to reassess its
international consequences. As noted in the introduction, [both pundits
and policymakers have long warned of retrenchment's immense costs which
result from the fact that it opens windows of opportunity for rivals to
improve their position in the international system]{.underline}. But
does retrenchment, indeed, regularly pave the way for rivals to acquire
important strategic assets? I argue that it does not. To make this
point, I proceed as follows. I first show that [[it is the]{.mark}
[collapse of]{.mark} a [great power's authority]{.mark}, [not]{.mark}
the [withdrawal of military force]{.mark} per se, [that]{.mark}
[presents]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
then make the case that [great powers engaging in three of the four
types of retrenchment my framework identifies should regularly be able
to avoid precipitating such authority collapse.]{.underline} Finally, I
highlight that [even when great powers engage in the one type of
retrenchment that does create such opportunities for rival gains, there
is good reason to believe that rivals will frequently not be able to
acquire these gains at negligible costs]{.underline}. What invites rival
expansion? Centering great power authority collapse In their warnings
about the dangers of strategic withdrawals, pundits and policymakers
centrally build on the assumption that whenever a great power removes
some its military capabilities from a certain geographic space, this
will open a window of opportunity allowing its rivals to expand their
influence into the area.Footnote33 In this section, I challenge this
popular belief, arguing that it is only when a great power's authority
collapses that the costs for rivals to extend their influence into the
space concerned sink dramatically. Following Weber, authority denotes
the 'legitimate exercise of imperative control' and is a function of
both material capability and legitimacy.Footnote34 The possession of
preponderant coercive capabilities and the ability to use them to issue
coercive threats is the cornerstone of any form of imperative control:
it generates widespread obedience as even those 'subjects who view the
ruler's orders as fundamentally unjust have an interest in compliance if
said orders are backed by preponderant power and the threat of
sanctions'. At the same time, stability and longevity of rule require at
least some degree of legitimacy in the sense that subjects follow the
ruler's commands quasi-voluntarily, i.e. they willingly comply with its
demands for whatever ulterior motivation and therefore do not need to be
constantly monitored and punished.Footnote35 [Historically, great powers
have exercised authority not only over their own homeland but also minor
powers and other political organisations outside of
it]{.underline}.Footnote36 Such cases of spatially extensive authority
in which great powers establish authority over other polities usually
take one of two primary forms. [First, great powers can exercise
authority through the maintenance of a formal empire]{.underline}. In
this constellation, an imperial state or metropole acquires territorial
control over political spaces outside of its own homeland and wields
authority over them as formal colonies or dependencies. Formal empires
thus involve direct rule and formal incorporation into the metropolitan
state.Footnote37 [Second, great powers sometimes exercise authority
without acquiring formal territorial control.]{.underline} [The
political spaces they rule in this manner have variably been called
their 'informal empires' or '[spheres of
influence']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote38 In these cases, a great power
exercises authority not through territorial control but through national
authorities which enter a relationship of subordination with the great
power while still retaining their nominal independence. [Just like
formal empires, these arrangements of imperial control are
[depend]{.mark}ent up[on]{.mark} both pillars of
[authority]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e. not only the ability to inspire a
sufficient degree of willing obedience but also to project preponderant
power into the space concerned. [Consider, for instance, the US sphere
of influence in Latin America]{.underline}: although the United States'
position of predominance does not require a permanent military presence
on the ground as its local subordinates generally comply with its
demands, [the stability of its rule depends crucially on its ability to
enforce its dictates militarily if push came to shove]{.underline}.
[When a great power exercises authority over a political space, this
effectively [limits]{.mark} the [ability of other]{.mark} great
power[s]{.mark} [to 'gain]{.mark} direct [access]{.mark} and control of'
the 'population and territory' it contains]{.underline}, [as rivals
could hope to extend their influence into the space only at tremendous
costs]{.underline}.Footnote39 Seizing authority over another great
power's territorial possessions would be possible only by conquering and
occupying them. Attempts to challenge a great power's control over its
sphere of influence are similarly costly. After all, its hold on
authority over these spaces implies not only that the great power is
able to project preponderant power there, but also that its rule enjoys
sufficient legitimacy. Any adversary seeking to assert control in its
stead must not only expect to trigger a military confrontation with a
peer competitor but also faces the prospect of an indigenous population
that is committed to retaining said peer competitor's rule. In the words
of Eric Forman, [by claiming authority over various geographic spaces
great powers thus erect 'fences or "hard shells" around specific
portions of the globe', effectively shielding them from the influence of
their rivals]{.underline}.Footnote40 [When a great power's authority
over a space collapses, however, this destroys the protective shell
around it]{.underline}. [Such [authority collapse can occur]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [two]{.mark} main [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
possibility is that [[the]{.mark} great [power]{.mark} [loses]{.mark}
large parts of the [material]{.mark} [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
[rule]{.mark}, i.e. it is no longer capable of projecting preponderant
material power]{.underline} into the respective space and is therefore
no longer in a position to fend off outside challenges to its position
of predominance. [The other is that [the]{.mark} [great power
experiences]{.mark} a pronounced [loss in legitimacy]{.mark}, i.e. it
loses its ability to elicit quasi-voluntary compliance with its commands
from subordinate political actors]{.underline}. As the former
subordinates turn away from the great power, they will not only refuse
to defend its rule but might even invite attempts by other powers to
oust and replace it in the hope of thus acquiring greater security or
other material as well as normative benefits for themselves. Overall,
whether the collapse of a great power's authority is due to the erosion
of its ability to project power into the space, its legitimacy, or both,
it radically alters third parties' strategic calculus: specifically, the
great power's peers realise that they now face the unique opportunity to
seek and claim control over a space that was previously impervious to
their rule. [Shifting our analytic focus from the removal of military
capabilities to authority collapse]{.underline} when discussing
strategic withdrawals' likely consequences might at first appear to be
nothing more than a minor semantic move. On closer inspection, however,
it [has far-reaching consequences for how to think about the connection
between retrenchment and possible rival gains]{.underline}. Most
importantly, [it reveals that the [withdrawal]{.mark} [of military
force]{.mark} from a particular space [alone]{.mark} [is neither
necessary nor sufficient to invite]{.mark} [rival]{.mark}
[expansion]{.mark}: it is possible that a great power maintains
authority over spaces outside of its homeland even without a direct
military presence within them, and it is similarly possible that it
loses authority over spaces abroad despite a continued military
presence]{.underline}. As I now turn to show, [[unduly focusing
on]{.mark} the removal of [military power]{.mark} per se [rather
than]{.mark} the collapse of [authority]{.mark} [has thus]{.mark} led
pundits and policymakers [to]{.mark} reach [distorted
assessments]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [retrenchment's
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why many strategic withdrawals do not pave
the way for rival gains All types of retrenchment my framework outlines
entail at least a partial reduction in a great power's military presence
on the ground. Hence, pundits and policymakers have concluded,
retrenchment regularly invites rival expansion. This thinking, however,
is too simplistic. As noted above, windows of opportunities rivals might
exploit emerge when a great power's disengagement causes its authority
to collapse. In this section, I argue that [there are strong reasons to
believe that [great powers engaging in]{.mark} three out of the four
forms of strategic [withdrawal]{.mark} my conceptual framework
identifies -- cutting back, delegating, and downsizing -- [will]{.mark}
often be able to [retain]{.mark} their [authority]{.mark} over the
respective area]{.underline}. [[Consequently]{.mark}, [no opportunities
for rival expansion emerge]{.mark} that would pose a threat to the
retrenching great power's security]{.underline}. In other words, these
forms of retrenchment do not carry the costs strategic withdrawals are
frequently alleged to entail. [Let us, [first]{.mark}, consider [cutting
back]{.mark}, i.e. retrenchment which takes the form of a great power
engaging in a partial military withdrawal from an area outside of its
homeland]{.underline}. When cutting back, [[the]{.mark} retrenching
[great]{.mark} [power]{.mark} continues to [retain]{.mark} at least a
token [force]{.mark} -- and often more than that]{.underline} -- in the
area, [which helps maintain order on the ground and deters outside
challenges to its rule, at a minimum, by functioning as a
tripwire]{.underline}.Footnote41 [In addition, it [continues to
bolster]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} through non-military means such
as the provision of economic aid or diplomatic assurances]{.underline},
[which it might even increase in order to assuage any domestic
opposition]{.underline} against the partial troop withdrawal [and signal
to other parties that it remains committed to the defence of the
area]{.underline}. In principle, great powers should thus be able to
retain their authority when engaging in this type of retrenchment. Given
the limited scope and depth of disengagement cutting back entails, the
risks associated with it are relatively small. Admittedly, it remains a
theoretical possibility that a limited troop withdrawal will set off a
cascade of events through which the great power's authority becomes
significantly weakened.Footnote42 For example, domestic as well as
international observers could perceive it as the prelude to a more
thorough disengagement, conclude that the great power's commitment to
the area is wavering, and thus feel incentivised to challenge its
position of predominance. Yet [the [likelihood]{.mark} [for]{.mark} such
[cascades]{.mark} to occur [appears slim]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[as]{.mark} [the threat of]{.mark} great power [war continues to
loom]{.mark} in the background]{.underline}, [and local actors remain
aware of the great power's continued ability to militarily fend of
challenges to its rule if necessary]{.underline}. Most of the time,
cutting back should thus be possible without worrying about creating
opportunities for rivals to expand their influence abroad. [Second,
[even]{.mark} a [complete]{.mark} troop [withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- such as occurs when delegating -- [[need not precipitate]{.mark} the
[collapse]{.mark} of a great power's authority]{.underline}. As
explained above, [when a great power decides to retrench by delegating,
it essentially attempts to switch from a political arrangement in which
boots on the ground are a key foundation of its control over the area to
one of indirect rule,]{.underline} i.e. in which it continues to
exercise predominant influence in the respective space but does so
remotely, usually by recruiting local political authorities as its
proxies. [The underlying logic of delegation]{.underline} -- and what
makes it so appealing for great powers in the first place [-- is that it
allows them to retain predominant influence while dramatically reducing
the costs of doing so by eliminating the direct military presence on the
ground]{.underline}. The goal is not to rescind one's authority, but to
exercise it through an alternative, less costly arrangement. Put
differently, pursuing delegation is centrally motivated by the goal of
withdrawing military forces without precipitating the kind of authority
collapse rivals might be able to exploit. In principle, delegation of
course carries the risk that the switch to indirect rule fails. Hoping
to exercise the same degree of imperative control as before, the great
power might find that it overestimated its ability to rule from afar.
For instance, local political actors might turn out to be unreliable
either in terms of their will to behave in accordance with the great
power's dictates or in terms of their ability to maintain military
capabilities sufficient to deter outside intervention. Yet, as the
strategic actors that they are, great powers are well aware of this
possibility and will therefore only pursue delegation when they are
near-certain that it will succeed, i.e. they are confident in their
prospective proxy's reliability. What should thus occur more frequently
than great powers pursuing delegation and later finding that it failed
is great powers planning to pursue it, concluding that it is not viable,
and therefore never implementing it. Not coincidentally, there are few
examples in modern history in which great powers pursued delegation and
failed.Footnote43 As an illustrative example, consider US plans for a
full military disengagement from Western and Central Europe after the
conclusion of World War II. It is increasingly well documented that,
from the United States' entry into the war onwards, the leadership in
Washington hoped to avoid any prolonged military entanglement on the
continent.Footnote44 During the war, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that
'the United States will be only too glad to retire all its military
forces from Europe as soon as this is feasible', and throughout the two
following administrations US officials did not give up on the idea that
any direct military involvement on the continent should not be allowed
to become a perpetual one.Footnote45 Yet the United States never
actually implemented a full military withdrawal and -- instead of
pursuing retrenchment as delegation, as initially planned -- US troops
remained on the continent indefinitely after the conclusion of the war.
The key underlying reason for this was that the power differential
between the Soviet Union and the Western European states, despite the
profound aid they had received through the European Recovery Program and
other initiatives, remained too stark as Soviet capabilities soared.
From Washington's perspective, retrenching by delegating was simply not
feasible, and they therefore never engaged in this type of strategic
retrenchment.Footnote46 [[Finally,]{.mark} consider
[downsizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recall that when retrenching by
downsizing a great power initiates a partial military withdrawal and
simultaneously works to reduce its politico-economic involvement in an
area outside of its homeland. [The type of disengagement this form of
retrenchment entails is [encompassing in scope]{.mark}]{.underline} --
it targets both military and non-military foundations of influence --
[[but limited in degree]{.mark}, as the great power neither fully
withdraws its troop presence nor completely abolishes its economic and
diplomatic involvement]{.underline}. Whether this type of retrenchment
will pave the way for rival gains will vary from case to case: it
centrally depends on how large the retrenching great power's remaining
politico-military footprint is after the completion of the downsizing
process. Yet, [given that it [retains]{.mark} a [military
presence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} simultaneously [continues to
utilise]{.mark} other tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit
to a lesser extent) to bolster its relationship with local political
actors, [in many cases the retrenching great power's authority will
likely be somewhat weakened but not erode to the point that outside
actors would feel compelled to compete for control over the
area.]{.underline} [The retrenching great power's [remaining]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} [will]{.mark} help [deter]{.mark} outside
[aggression]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the economic and diplomatic
[support]{.mark} it continues to offer not only [signals]{.mark} its
[continued]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} in shaping the area's political
future but will help [bolster]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} and secure their continued allegiance]{.underline}. In
consequence, while the reductions downsizing entails might, in some
cases, indeed end up being so pronounced that they precipitate a
collapse of authority, there are good reasons to believe that there will
exist just as many cases in which great powers downsize without opening
windows of opportunity for their rivals to exploit. The consequences of
abandonment: Strategic disaster guaranteed? [[But]{.mark} what about the
fourth and most extreme type of retrenchment, i.e. [abandoning]{.mark}?
When a great power decides to abandon a certain part of the world, it
effectively [revokes]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark} over
it.]{.underline} Its military forces are fully withdrawn, it no longer
offers economic or security benefits to incentivise subordination from
local political actors, and thus effectively abolishes the hierarchical
relationship that served as the foundation of its influence. [Given the
all-encompassing scope and depth of this type of retrenchment, it is
essentially unavoidable that it [opens]{.mark} a [window of
opportunity]{.mark} [for other powers]{.mark} to compete for authority
over the respective space]{.underline}. As opposed to those cases in
which the other three types of retrenchment are concerned, prima facie
it therefore appears more plausible to argue that when a great power
retrenches by abandoning it is bound to incur significant costs.
[[Still]{.underline}]{.mark}, [one should be careful not to overestimate
the risks associated with abandonment either]{.underline}. [While the
collapse of the retrenching great power's authority will noticeably
reduce the costs for its rivals to try and claim control]{.underline}
over the space it leaves behind -- most importantly, they must no longer
fear a direct military confrontation with a peer competitor -- [[this
does not]{.mark} [necessarily]{.mark} entail that said costs will be
sufficiently low to [render]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}
[attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When faced]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark} of a great power seeking to claim control over them,
historically, [nation-states]{.mark} have [respond]{.mark}ed not by
appeasing or bandwagoning with the outside power but [by]{.mark}
[balancing]{.mark} against it]{.underline}.Footnote47 Because of these
local balancing dynamics, other great powers seeking to expand their
influence after the retrenching great power's departure are thus [[still
likely to confront a]{.mark} respectable [obstacle that could]{.mark}
prove formidable enough to [deter them]{.mark}]{.underline} from
realising whatever expansionist ambitions they might harbour.Footnote48
Perhaps even more importantly, one should be careful not to take the
above discussion to suggest that abandonment will necessarily represent
a strategic disaster for the retrenching great power. This piece is
primarily concerned with the costs of retrenchment and how they have
been consistently overestimated. Whether retrenchment in any given
instance leads to increases or decreases in a great power's security,
however, depends as much on the benefits it acquires by pursuing this
course of action. In other words, even if retrenchment by abandonment
does open a window of opportunity that is successfully exploited by
rivals which acquire important strategic assets, these costs --
significant as they may be -- might be outweighed by the benefits the
retrenching great power acquires. The latter can include, among others:
a lower likelihood of involving the great power's troops in active
combat; considerably less strain on the great power's economy, on whose
health its power crucially depends in the long run; the ability to
invest more resources to address domestic issues of concern; and freeing
resources to deal with more vital security threat in other regions of
the world.Footnote49 Indeed, being the strategic actors that they are,
we should not observe great powers abandoning certain areas of the globe
unless they are confident that the resultant benefits will ultimately
outweigh the costs they will incur by engaging in this form of
retrenchment.Footnote50

The era of [American **[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which dominated
global affairs since 1945 and reached its peak after 1991, [is [coming
to an **end**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [rather than lament
this]{.underline} shift, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} and the world
[[should **embrace**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[opportunities]{.mark} it
presents]{.underline}.

For too long, [the U.S. has shouldered]{.underline} the burden of
**[global policing]{.underline}**, tied to the notion of [maintaining a
"[rules-based]{.mark}]{.underline} international
**[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [that [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
increasingly **[[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The end of this era
opens the door to [a]{.underline} more just, prosperous and
[**[realistic]{.mark}** world order]{.underline} --- one that [is [based
on **balancing**]{.mark}]{.underline} global [powers rather than
dominating them]{.underline}. It's time for the U.S. to adopt a grand
strategy of restraint, rooted in realist international relations theory,
and reshape its role in a multipolar world.

The decline of American hegemony has been a gradual process, accelerated
by major events but always rooted in deeper structural trends. The rise
of other global powers has challenged the ability of the U.S. to control
world affairs. [The **myth** that Washington]{.underline} believed after
the Cold War, that it [could dictate global **governance**]{.underline}
indefinitely, [was]{.underline} always [an illusion.
**Overreach**]{.underline} in military interventions, [coupled with
domestic and international **challenges**]{.underline}, have [weakened
American primacy.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} international system that the U.S. helped build after
World War II --- a [system of]{.underline} multilateral institutions and
[**liberal** norms]{.underline} --- has [shown **cracks** for
years]{.underline}. This was not a neutral or benevolent framework; it
was a structure that [served **American** interest**s**]{.underline},
often [at the expense of **other**]{.underline}
nation**[s]{.underline}**.

Now, with rising competition from other powers, the idea that Washington
can --- or should --- continue to act as the global enforcer is not only
unrealistic but also **[counterproductive]{.underline}**. [Clinging to
hegemony leads]{.underline} only [to]{.underline} more [costly
**interventions** and strategic **failures**]{.underline}, as evidenced
by recent decades of U.S. foreign policy.

The end of American hegemony is not a catastrophe but an opportunity to
adopt a more restrained and realistic approach to international
relations. A grand strategy of restraint, as grounded in realist theory,
recognizes the limitations of U.S. power and the dangers of
overextension.

Realism --- with its focus on national interest, the balance of power
and the inevitability of competition among states --- offers a clear
path forward. Rather than attempt to dominate or impose an ideological
framework on the world, the U.S. should focus on protecting its core
interests while avoiding unnecessary entanglements.

[[In a **multipolar** world]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. should be
**[one]{.mark}**]{.underline} power [[among many]{.mark}. The key to
maintaining **security**]{.underline} and stability [is]{.underline} not
through imposing American leadership but [through balance]{.underline}
--- [[engaging in]{.mark} selective competition and
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with other powers, without trying
to dominate them. This shift away from hegemony opens space for new
coalitions and more flexible partnerships based on mutual interest
rather than unilateral dominance.

As China rises and challenges American influence, it is tempting for
policymakers to frame the situation as a new Cold War, with China
replacing the Soviet Union as the primary adversary. But this is a
flawed analogy. The Cold War was a unique ideological and military
struggle between two superpowers, and trying to apply that same logic
today only invites dangerous escalation. [The U.S. should **not**
attempt to]{.underline} "**[contain]{.underline}**" [China]{.underline}
in the traditional sense of the word, which would only provoke
confrontation without serving U.S. interests.

Instead, Washington should pursue a strategy of "blunting" --- using its
power and influence to prevent any one nation from dominating key
regions or setting the rules of global governance. This realist approach
acknowledges that while [**[China's rise]{.mark}** cannot be stopped, it
[can be **managed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. should work with
allies and regional powers to ensure that Beijing's ambitions do not
come at the expense of American security or that of its partners. [By
focusing on]{.underline} maintaining a [balance of power, the U.S. can
**prevent** Chinese domination]{.underline} without overextending itself
in futile efforts at containment.

[**Blunting** is]{.underline} not about imposing America's will on the
world, but about [ensuring]{.underline} that **[no]{.underline}** other
[power can impose its **will**]{.underline}. This strategy recognizes
that the global order is shifting, and Washington's role should be [one
of prudent **management** rather than aggressive
intervention]{.underline}. Realist restraint means recognizing that the
U.S. cannot and should not be involved in every conflict, nor can it
dictate terms to every rising power.

The end of American hegemony liberates the U.S. from the yoke of global
policing, which it has borne to its own detriment for far too long. A
grand strategy of restraint would prioritize America's core national
interests, avoiding the costly and unnecessary interventions that
characterized much of its foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. The
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan illustrate the dangers of overreach and the
futility of trying to impose democratic values through military means.

[[Restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is **not
isolationism**]{.mark}. The U.S. still has [critical
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} that require engagement, particularly
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} key regions like [the [**Indo-Pacific** and
**Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But engagement must be guided by a
sober assessment of American power and the realistic limits of
influence. Realist theory teaches that international relations are
governed by competition among states, and in a multipolar world, [[the
U.S]{.mark}. must [pick]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[battles
**carefully**]{.underline}]{.mark}, choosing to intervene only where its
vital interests are at stake.

[This]{.underline} strategic recalibration [would allow]{.underline}
America to play [a **smarter** role in world affairs]{.underline} ---
working with allies when necessary, but not leading every charge. The
notion that any instability anywhere in the world threatens U.S.
security is no longer tenable, nor is the belief that the U.S. must bear
the burden of global governance alone.

The shift away from American hegemony opens the door to a more
sustainable world order that reflects the multipolar character of
contemporary international politics. This transition is a natural
evolution of the international system, and the U.S. must adapt by
embracing restraint and realism as the guiding principles of its foreign
policy.

In a more multipolar world order, [**smaller** powers and **regional**
actors]{.underline} will [have greater **agency**]{.underline}, and
multilateral [cooperation]{.underline} will be [driven by **shared
interests** rather than imposed]{.underline} norms. The U.S. has an
opportunity to lead by example instead of through coercion. By focusing
on blunting the more extreme ambitions of illiberal powers like China,
Washington can help shape a world that is more stable and equitable.

[The age of U.S. dominance is over]{.underline}, but that is not a cause
for alarm. It is a chance to build a more just and prosperous
international system --- one grounded in the realities of power politics
and the recognition that **[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather
than overreach, [is [the path to]{.mark} sustainable
**[security]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Decline motivates [restraint]{.underline} and peace, [not]{.underline} violent wars.

Published by *Cornell University Press*)

In this book, we argue that [[the **conventional wisdom** is
**wrong**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Specifically, we make three main
arguments. First, relative [[**decline** causes **prompt, proportionate
retrenchment** because states seek **strategic
solvency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The international system is a
competitive place, and great powers did not get to the top by being
imprudent, irrational, or irresponsible]{.underline}. When their
fortunes ebb, states tend to retain the virtues that made them great.
[In the face of decline, [great powers have a **good sense of their
relative capability**]{.mark} and tend not to give away more than they
must]{.underline}. Expanding or [[maintaining **grand strategic
ambitions** during **decline** incurs **unsustainable burdens** and
**incites unwinnable fights**]{.underline}]{.mark}, so the faster states
fall, the more they retrench. Great powers may choose to retrench in
other circumstances as well, but they have an overriding incentive to do
so when confronted by relative decline. Second, the depth of
[[**relative decline** shapes]{.mark} not only [how much a state
retrenches, but]{.mark} also **[which policies it
adopts]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The world is complex and
cutthroat; leaders cannot glibly pull a policy off the shelf and expect
desired outcomes. Because international politics is a self-help system,
great powers prefer policies that rely less on the actions of allies and
adversaries. For lack of a better term, we refer to these as domestic
policies, which include reducing spending, restructuring forces, and
reforming institutions---all to reallocate resources for more efficient
uses. But [international policies]{.underline} may also help, and they
[include [**redeploying forces**, **defusing flashpoints**, and
**redistributing burdens**]{.mark}---all to [**avoid costly conflicts**
and **reinforce core strongpoints**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The faster and
deeper states fall, the more they are willing to rely on others to
cushion their fall. Retrenchment is not a weapon but an arsenal that can
be used in different amounts and combinations depending on conditions
and the enemies faced. Third, after depth, structural conditions are the
most important factors shaping how great powers respond to relative
decline. Four conditions catalyze the incentives for declining states to
retrench. One is the declining state's rank. States in the top rungs of
the great power hierarchy have more resources and margin for error than
those lower down, so there is less urgency for them to retrench. Another
is the availability of allies. Where states can shift burdens to capable
regional powers with similar preferences, retrenchment is less risky and
difficult. Yet another is the interdependence of commitments. When
states perceive commitments in one place as tightly linked to
commitments elsewhere, pulling back becomes harder and less likely. The
last catalyst is the calculus of conquest. If aggression pays, then
retrenchment does not, and great powers will be loath to do it. The
world is not just complex and cutthroat, it is also dynamic. No set of
conditions is everlasting, and leaders must change with the times.
Empirically, [this work aims to add value by being the first to study
systematically all modern shifts in the great power pecking
order]{.underline}. [[We find **sixteen cases of relative**
**decline**]{.mark} since 1870]{.underline}, when reliable data for the
great powers become available, [and compare them to their non-declining
counterparts across a variety of measures]{.underline}. To preview the
findings, [[retrenchment is **by far the most common response** to
**relative decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and declining powers behave
differently from non-declining powers. States in decline are more likely
to cut the size of their military forces and budgets and in extreme
cases are more likely to form alliances. This does not, however, make
them ripe for exploitation; declining states perform comparatively well
in militarized disputes. Our headline finding, however, is that states
that retrench recover their prior rank with some regularity, but those
that fail to retrench never do. These results challenge theories of
grand strategy and war, offer guidance to policymakers, and indicate
overlooked paths to peace.

resiliency,\" said Danielle Miller, acting deputy assistant secretary of
defense for industrial base resilience. \"[**We are [on track to]{.mark}
meet our goal** of a sustainable]{.underline}, mine-to-magnet [supply
chain capable of [support]{.mark}ing [all U.S. defense
requirements]{.mark} by 2027.]{.underline}\"  In addition to the F-35,
Virginia and Columbia class submarines, magnets produced from [rare
earth elements are used in]{.underline} systems such as Tomahawk
[missiles, a variety of radar systems]{.underline}, Predator [unmanned
aerial vehicles, and]{.underline} the Joint Direct Attack Munition
series of [smart bombs]{.underline}. The F-35, for instance, requires
more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements. Each Arleigh Burke DDG-51
destroyer requires 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia class submarine needs
9,200 pounds. Sailors stand atop a submarine. [Rare earth elements are
also used in]{.underline} other ways that don\'t involve magnets.
[Vehicle-mounted laser range finders]{.underline}, such as those found
on Abrams M1A1/2 tanks, make use of rare earth elements, as do their
portable counterparts [and target designators]{.underline}. Also making
use of rare earth elements are; [fiber optics communication systems;
cerium-polished optical lenses; and sonic transducers used in submarine
sonar systems. ]{.underline} There are 17 elements on the periodic table
referred to as \"rare earth\" elements. While DOD needs nearly all of
them in some capacity, three are used to make the permanent magnets
critical to so many defense systems.  Continued U.S. reliance on foreign
sources for rare earth products poses a risk to national security. The
U.S. and most of the world depends on China for many rare earth
elements. Through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Industrial Base Policy, the Manufacturing Capability Expansion and
Investment Program directorate has embarked on a five-year rare earth
investment strategy to build \"mine-to-magnet\" [domestic capacity at
all critical nodes of the rare earth supply chain.]{.underline} Those
critical nodes include sourcing, separation, processing, metallization,
alloying and magnet manufacturing.  The first of those critical nodes,
the sourcing of rare earth elements, means [mining rare earth elements
out of the ground]{.underline}. Today in the U.S., there is only one
rare earth mine currently active and selling to the commercial market.
Separation includes a series of processes that take out extractable rare
earth elements from other elements and compounds in the mineral rock.
Processing involves concentrating separated rare earth elements and then
chemically treating them to produce high-purity rare earth oxides or
rare earth salts. The metallization step transforms rare earth salts
into rare earth metals. Depending on the application, those metals can
be combined with various alloying elements to produce a variety of rare
earth alloys.  Finally, rare earth magnets are typically produced from
alloys that are sintered, or bonded, into magnet block and then cut and
coated according to specification.  [It\'s important that **[all those
critical nodes happen inside the U.S.]{.mark}** so **[the]{.mark}
Defense [Department]{.mark} can [have a secure supply]{.mark}** of the
rare earth materials and rare earth magnets it needs. ]{.underline}
[Projects underway have [already]{.mark} helped the U.S. [establish
growing capacity]{.mark}]{.underline} in rare earth element separation
and processing, as well as magnet manufacturing.  Spotlight: Science &
Tech Among the U.S.-based companies involved in DOD\'s
\"mine-to-magnets\" initiative is MP Materials, which is headquartered
in Nevada. With [\$45 million in support from MCEIP awards, MP Materials
established]{.underline} the only integrated [rare earth mine and oxide
production facility]{.underline} in the U.S. The company is expected to
continue to add capacity for additional oxide products through 2025,
when they are projected to reach full-scale production.  Right now,
domestic and partner demand for rare earth materials outpaces the
production of any single partner nation. To build resiliency in these
critical, early stages of the supply chain, Lynas USA, LLC was awarded a
combined [\$288 million in MCEIP funding to establish a second domestic,
commercial-scale oxide production capability by 2026.]{.underline} 
MCEIP has also [invested \$10 million to explore the development of

### China Peaceful

#### Overwhelming empirics prove China is committed to the existing order

Not Ready to Remake the World Order

China has gained more ground from Trump's retreat to defend its values
and interests. However, [[China]{.mark}]{.underline} remains a
revisionist stakeholder and [[is **not ready to remake the world
order**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} "America
First" and self-centered [[unilateralism have demonstrated]{.mark} all
the hallmarks of [a revisionist state]{.mark}, making it far easier for
China to be seen as a responsible stakeholder]{.underline} in the world
order. Distinguishing itself from Trump's unilateralism that has thrown
quite chaos and has torn away the very bedrock of the postwar order
under which, for all its faults, China and many other countries have
prospered mightily, [[China has continued to promote
multilat]{.mark}eralism as it interpreted and position itself as the
global ballast and institution-builder [by]{.mark} pledging to continue
[supporting the WTO and UN]{.mark}]{.underline}, honoring the Paris
Accord and other international treaties and working together with other
countries to address global challenges.

[[China has launched new initiatives and institutions]{.underline},
**[but they do not amount to replacing the existing
order]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} commentaries
expressed [[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China would]{.mark} use the
BRICS, BRI, and AIIB to [create]{.mark} [alternative rules for its
narrow interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, **[[none of them has
even been close to that]{.mark} end.]{.underline}** For example, the
Beijing-led AIIB has not become a blatant agent of Chinese foreign
policy but a multilateral development institution. The AIIB modeled the
governance structure and standards of established multilateral lending
institutions, engaged former officials from these institutions to help
craft policies, and pledged \"lean, clean, and green.\" Emphasizing
transparency, accountability, openness, and independence, AIIB adopted
international norms and standards in line with the practices of
established institutions in environment, society, disclosure,
procurement, debt sustainability, and oversight mechanisms.

[[As part of the postwar order]{.underline}, **[not apart from
it]{.underline}**]{.mark} as was the Soviet Union, [[China holds a stake
in maintaining the order that allows it to pursue its agenda within the
existing]{.mark} international institutional
[framework]{.mark}]{.underline}---freed up to do so by the United
States' new spoiler role. This role is won by default, not by taking
leadership in supplying regional and global public goods---let alone
collaborating with partners, such as the United States did in the years
after World War 2, to wrap itself in multilaterally negotiated rules.37

#### China doesn't promote authoritarianism

This alternative approach raises questions about political legitimacy as
well. [Western commentators often claim that Chinese people support
their government only out of fear]{.underline}. But
[research]{.underline} like the Anthropology of Democracy (AoD) project
--- recently shared by Jason Hickel --- [challenges that
assumptio]{.underline}n. Using anonymised, bias-reducing survey methods,
the study finds that [[Chinese citizens express exceptionally high
levels of satisfaction with]{.mark} their [government]{.mark} and its
responsiveness]{.underline}. [[If fear alone were the driver, we'd
expect similar results in other authoritarian states]{.underline} ---
**[but we don't]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For example, only 50% of
Russians in the same survey said they believed their country was
democratic.

[Many people struggle with the idea that China could be seen as
democratic at all]{.underline}. [But this rests on a narrow, [Western
definition of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} --- one [that [focuses
exclusively on]{.mark} multi-party [elections]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, [[frames its system as
"whole-process people's democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}," [grounded
in]{.underline} a unique party system and democratic centralism, [local
elections, and mechanisms for policy consultation and
feedback]{.underline}. While different in form, the system seeks to
institutionalise responsiveness to popular needs.

Whether or not one agrees with that framework, what matters is how it
functions in the eyes of the people. [In much of the West, citizens
increasingly feel alienated from political institutions and
disillusioned with the ability of electoral systems to deliver
meaningful change.]{.underline} [[In China, people **overwhelmingly
believe their government acts in the interest of the
majority**]{.underline}. [That perception]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
regardless of system design --- [[may be a **more important indicator of
democratic legitimacy** than ballots alone.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### No China War

**No China war\-\--prefer structured, [red-team-analysis]{.underline}
backed by the [DOD]{.underline}.** Preparation for war does
[not]{.underline} make war '[inevitable]{.underline}.'  

**Scheidemann '24** \[Jacob T.; March 27; Army officer, Intelligence
Management Graduate Student; Air Force Times, "Despite common rhetoric,
war with China unlikely in near future,"
https://www.airforcetimes.com/opinion/2024/03/27/despite-common-rhetoric-war-with-china-unlikely-in-near-future/\]

Title: [Despite **common rhetoric**, war with China
**unlikely**]{.underline} in near future

As soldiers look for the next conflict to define their service in a
post-Global War on Terrorism era, [much of the conversation indicates a
belief that **direct** or **proxy war** with China is right **around the
corner**.]{.underline} [However, assessing the **likelihood** of armed
conflict requires a deep investigation using **proven
methods**]{.underline} that stimulate critical thinking devoid of biases
and pitfalls.

In the intelligence community, structured analytical techniques provide
order when navigating elusive questions such as assessing future
conflict. One such technique, [**red team analysis**, uses an
**enemy-based** approach as a logical **starting point** for analysts
disseminating **intelligence** to military customers]{.underline}.

Using this approach allows analysts to view topics from an adversary's
perspective and act on foreign stimuli through assessing personal,
cultural, and organizational attributes. Stepping into the first-person
perspective of Chinese President Xi indicates that he respects the
ancient civilization from which China evolved and harbors a lifelong
disdain for Western imperialism and influence.

Born in 1953, President Xi grew up in the immediate aftermath of the
"century of humiliation," now defined by century-long objectives of
achieving previously held international dominance by the year 2049.
Commonly known as the "Chinese Dream," this pursuit of rejuvenation is
marked by five-year plans that outline short-term goals.

The recent five-year plan (2016-20), for example, broadcasted innovation
in technology and energy startup companies, according to a 2017 article
published in the Journal of Counterterrorism & Homeland Security
International. Modern economic, military, and political competition of
the United States exasperate the five-year plans and long-term
objectives of global supremacy that are overarching cultural and
organizational themes of President Xi's generation.

Red team analysis indicates that [China will not interrupt
**century-long goals** to engage in **kinetic conflict**]{.underline},
explaining why China relies on routine hybrid warfare strategies and
tactics. In 2023, despite red team analysis outputs, the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency communicated that the intelligence community
had valuable information related to Chinese intent to invade Taiwan by
2027.

President Xi did not deny this assertion, however, citing he had no set
timeline for invading Taiwan. Red team analysis presents a doubtful
outlook of armed conflict in the near future despite conflicting CIA
intelligence.

[It is difficult to overstate the **utility** of red team
analysis]{.underline} when assessing the actions of adversaries.
Oftentimes, analysts can succumb to the pitfall of assigning the same
values, motives, and attributes of friendly actors to foreign entities.
If analysts were to implement this analytical failure to the outlined
scenario, outputs would have overlooked the historical context,
long-term objectives, and overarching strategies that form President
Xi's mindset surrounding U.S. relations and emerging war.

For instance, views from within the U.S. fail to recognize vast
advancements in personal freedoms afforded to Chinese citizens over the
past few decades. (Like much of the rest of the world, COVID-19
restrictions prompted a decrease in personal freedoms that were trending
upward in the 2010s.)

By applying personal, cultural, and organizational norms to the
scenario, analysts reason that while red team analysis leads one to
think armed conflict is likely before or at the end of the century of
China's redemption plan, [a **few years** is too short of a time frame
for China to soundly invade **Taiwan** because the country would have to
put aside **economic progress**]{.underline}.

This factor is especially important considering that China does not need
to engage in kinetic operations to successfully degrade the U.S.
economy. This assessment, however, merely represents the most likely
course of action.

Red team analysis does not deduce every course of action an adversary
can take. However, [a **crucial aspect** of red team analysis commonly
used in the **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense is deciphering an enemy's
**most likely** action versus one considered **most
dangerous**]{.underline}.

These distinct courses of action allow customers to plan for both the
most expected and most disastrous outcomes of assessed scenarios. Within
the context of armed conflict in the South China Sea, commanders of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command must understand each course of action to best
posture troop positioning and inform engagements with lawmakers and
regional partners.

Certainly, [**red team analysis** points out that conflict is
**unlikely** as an **immediate response**, but the U.S. must prepare for
full-scale war as a **worst case**]{.underline}, most deadly
possibility. [While this preparation should be taken
**seriously**]{.underline} by all soldiers, [it is by **no means** an
indication of **inevitable conflict**]{.underline}.

#### No readiness impact -- aversion to war solves

Maintaining a Large Military Force is Unnecessary

Third, the rise of [an [aversion to]{.mark} international [war
suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[there is scarcely a need to
maintain a]{.mark} large [military force]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact,
[the achievements of the US military since World War II]{.underline},
not to put too fine a point on it, [have not been very
impressive]{.underline}. Some continue to maintain that it was the
existence of the US military that kept the Soviet Union or China from
launching World War III. However, as suggested earlier, the Communist
side never saw direct war against the West as being a remotely sensible
tactic for advancing its revolutionary agenda; that is, there was
nothing to deter. Moreover, for all the very considerable expense, [the
American military has won no wars during that
period]{.underline}---especially if victory is defined as achieving an
objective at an acceptable cost---[except against enemy forces that
scarcely existed: Grenada, Panama, Kosovo, and Iraq in the Gulf War of
1991.]{.underline}

[More recently, there has been a successful war
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} the insurgent group the Islamic State, or
[[ISIS]{.mark}. However, [the]{.mark} principal [American contribution
has been air support]{.mark}; others have done the heavy lifting---and
dying]{.underline}.71 The US military can take credit for keeping South
Korea independent---no other country at the time would have been able to
do that. But it went to war there in 1950 for other reasons, and it
badly botched the effort and massively increased the costs by seeking to
liberate North Korea as well. And [in the 21st century, American
military policy, especially in the Middle East, has been]{.underline},
for the most part, [an abject failure]{.underline}. In particular, at
the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives, Iraq and Afghanistan have
undergone more travail and destruction than they would likely have
undergone even under the contemptible regimes of Saddam Hussein and the
Taliban.

[[Maintaining a huge]{.mark} and expensive US military
[force]{.mark}-in-being [might make sense, despite the]{.mark} abundant
[record of failure, if there existed]{.mark} coherent [threats]{.mark}
that required such a force. Although there are certainly problem
areas]{.underline} and issues in the world, [[none]{.mark} of these
seems to [present a]{.mark} security [threat]{.mark} to the United
States [large]{.mark} or urgent [enough]{.mark}]{.underline}.72 It may
make sense to hedge a bit, however, by judiciously maintaining small
contingents of troops for rapid response and for policing functions, a
capacity to provide air support for friendly ground troops in localized
combat, a small number of nuclear weapons for the (wildly) unlikely
event of the rise of another Hitler, something of an effort to deal with
cyber, an adept intelligence capacity, and the development of a capacity
to rebuild quickly should a sizable threat eventually materialize.

And there is a related issue: [having [a large force tempts leaders to
use the military to solve problems for which it is]{.mark}
inappropriate, inadequate, and often
[counterproductive]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the wake of the disastrous
Vietnam War, Bernard Brodie wistfully reflected that ["one way of
keeping people out of trouble is to deny them the means for getting into
it."]{.underline}73 More than forty years later, Brodie's admonition
continues to be relevant.

#### Readiness thesis is wrong -- empirics prove.

and Military Effectiveness," 2021, *Parameters*, Vol. 51, Issue 3,
https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3079&context=parameters,
EA\]

Measuring the effectiveness of military forces is a more realistic
framework and a cheaper organizing principle than readiness, with forces
like cyber already engaged with adversaries. Effectiveness entails how
well military forces are accomplishing missions across the levels of war
and satisfying the requirements of national policy objectives.10 The
[**[readiness]{.mark}** of standing forces]{.underline} usually [**[does
not equate to effectiveness]{.mark}** in achieving national policy
objectives. America's [pre-1950 era witnessed **better**]{.mark}
**strategic military [results]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the postmodern
era [[even though]{.mark} the standing military [forces **were not
ready**]{.mark} at the outset of wars, experiencing tactical losses in
First Battles]{.underline}.11

The post-1950 expensive standing military establishment has fostered a
tactical mindset, distracting military leadership from strategic
thinking. This has led to less national policy success at astronomically
higher costs.12 US/NATO readiness did achieve deterrence against the
Soviet Bloc, but [even during the Korean and Vietnam Wars the **[Soviets
remained deterred when]{.mark} US [readiness]{.mark}** in Europe
**[ebbed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As the Cold War intensified during the
Reagan administration, scholars explored military effectiveness,
particularly the mismatch between policy objectives and military ways
and means.13 This scholarship complements Drawdown's conclusions on the
necessity of technology and allies to offset the loss of force structure
means during drawdowns. Winning and losing wars is a complex issue
beyond the defense establishment purview alone, but the lack of
strategic results is a negative return on investment for an expensive
force structure.14

Achieving strategic results is imperative in an era of renewed great
power competition which the Department of Defense has described as the
"competition continuum," where powers remain in various states of
cooperation, competition, and conflict.15 Readying for a conflict in
progress is a contradictory proposition. The [[forces in competition
rapidly adapt]{.mark} to current circumstances [which]{.mark} may
require training for new equipment, organizations, and procedures that
the [readiness]{.mark} structure [did not
anticipate]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Joint Staff already utilizes
metrics for effectiveness in assessments of campaigning and operations,
the Department of Defense could readily refocus on effectiveness at the
operational level of war that links to both strategy and policy.16

Additionally, an effectiveness model corresponds with the competition
continuum, measuring a unit's progress toward objectives with the
reality of continual campaigning. It acknowledges conflict occurring in
multiple military domains and reorienting military leadership to current
missions. [[Readiness is]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[**irrelevant**
when adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} have [already [seized the
initiative]{.mark} in the information environment.]{.underline}17 Even
within an effectiveness structure, readiness processes must exist while
tactical forces are reconstituted. Effectiveness would take the lead in
this model, while readiness would orient toward the type of training
units need based on the current effectiveness of friendly forces.

#### Readiness has already reached an irreversible breaking point because of eligibility problems and lack of interest. 

David **Barno, 3-10-2023**, \"Addressing the U.S. Military Recruiting
Crisis,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/addressing-the-u-s-military-recruiting-crisis/
gac

**[The all-volunteer force may finally have reached its breaking
point.]{.underline}** During the first years of the recent wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, many military experts worried that the constant
deployments would "break" the force since they expected that fewer young
Americans would volunteer to serve in a wartime military. Thankfully,
that didn't happen. Yet **[a perilous recruiting crisis began just after
the United States fully withdrew from Afghanistan last summer, and it
shows no sign of abating anytime soon]{.underline}**. As a result, the
U.S. military is shrinking, not because of any strategic choices, but
simply because **[there aren't enough qualified
volunteers]{.underline}** --- and that may have enormous implications
for the U.S. strategic position in an increasingly uncertain and
dangerous world. How bad is the recruiting crisis? During the last
fiscal year, **[the Army missed its recruiting goal by 15,000
active-duty soldiers, or 25 percent of its target. This shortfall forced
the Army to cut its planned active-duty end strength from 476,000 to
466,000]{.underline}**. And the current fiscal year is likely to be even
worse. Army officials project that active end strength could shrink by
as much as 20,000 soldiers by September, down to 445,000. That means
that **[the nation's primary land force could plummet by as much as 7
percent in only two years --- at a time when its missions are increasing
in Europe and even in the Pacific]{.underline}**, where the Army
provides many of the critical wartime theater enablers without which the
other services cannot function. The other services barely met their
active-duty recruiting goals last year, but it will be harder for them
to do so in 2023. They all accelerated their delayed entry applicants at
the end of the last fiscal year, leaving them with a far shallower pool
to draw from this year. The Marine Corps may be able to compensate for
this problem because its outstanding retention rates last year enabled
it to lower its recruiting goal. It may be able to do so again this
year. But the Navy and the Air Force face greater recruiting headwinds.
Both started with deeper holes in their pool of delayed entry
applicants, offered extensive financial bonuses, and took a wide range
of other one-time measures --- such as the Navy increasing the maximum
enlistment age from 39 to 41. Furthermore, Navy and Air Force recruiters
took advantage of the release of Top Gun: Maverick, which, like its 1986
predecessor, was the highest-grossing film of the year. A recent
analysis showed that the original Top Gun boosted recruiting by 8
percent. To the extent that the sequel helped boost Navy and Air Force
enlistments in 2022, their recruiting holes could be even deeper in
2023. Indeed, the Air Force just announced that will likely fail to meet
its recruiting goals across all three of its components. Why is this
happening now? Part of it, no doubt, is that the end of the war in
Afghanistan makes military service seem less compelling. For the first
time in almost 20 years, American troops are no longer fighting abroad
to keep insurgents and terrorists at bay. Unemployment is low, which
always makes it harder to recruit --- and the tight labor market has
also forced many companies to increase wages and offer compelling
incentives to attract the best talent. But two other sets of factors are
interacting in complex ways that make it almost impossible to determine
which are having the greatest effect. First, **[the number of young
people who are eligible to serve in the military dropped precipitously
last year --- from an already low figure of 29 percent to a shocking 23
percent]{.underline}** --- largely due to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. **[Levels of depression, anxiety, and other mental health
conditions exploded among young Americans]{.underline}** (and many
not-so-young Americans), who faced sometimes extreme levels of social
isolation. School closures and remote instruction have caused test
scores to decline dramatically throughout the country (and the world),
and scores on the ASVAB, the military's standardized test for potential
recruits, declined by as much as 9 percent. Shuttered schools also made
it extremely difficult for recruiters to meet with young people and
develop the personal relationships that are so essential for their jobs.
And **[youth obesity rates]{.underline}** --- which have long been one
of the biggest reasons for military ineligibility **[--- increased from
19 percent to 22 percent during the pandemic. Few of these statistics
will rebound quickly --- and some may never recover to their
pre-pandemic levels.]{.underline}** Though improving eligibility is
extremely important, as we discuss below, it alone cannot solve the
recruiting crisis. **[The second, and much more challenging, factor
involves military propensity --- the number of young people who are
interested in serving in the military. Only 13 percent of young
Americans said they would consider military service before the pandemic,
and that already paltry figure shrank to just 9 percent last
year]{.underline}**. That number is simply not high enough to ensure the
stable flow of recruits upon which the all-volunteer force relies. Two
sets of survey data help explain why propensity may be declining. First,
**[the number of Americans expressing confidence in the U.S. military
has plummeted]{.underline}** in the past few years. To be clear,
American confidence in almost all major U.S. institutions has declined,
with data from Gallup showing that it reached an all-time average low of
just 27 percent in 2022. Compared to that dismal statistic, the fact
that 64 percent of survey respondents expressed confidence in the
military last year is a strong endorsement indeed. Yet that figure was
72 percent in 2020 and 69 percent in 2021 --- marking an 8 percentage
point drop in only two years. More disturbingly, the Reagan National
Defense Survey found even steeper declines, with confidence in the U.S.
military dropping from 70 percent in 2018 to just 45 percent in 2021
(before rebounding slightly to 48 percent in 2022). Second**[, there are
some early indications that fewer people in and around the military are
willing to recommend military service to young people]{.underline}**. In
2019, almost 75 percent of military families said they would recommend
military service to someone they care about. Yet that figure dropped to
just under 63 percent in 2021, another sharp decline in just two years.
Since 80 percent of the young people who join the military today have a
family member in the military --- and 25--30 percent have a parent in
the military --- it may well be that **[more military families are
steering their children away from uniformed service toward civilian
careers]{.underline}**.

[Some minerals]{.underline} -- [such as copper, nickel and
cobalt]{.underline} -- [are potentially available in]{.underline} great
abundance in [seabed deposits]{.underline}. [Others, such as [lithium
and **r**are **e**arth]{.mark} **e**lements]{.underline},
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also present in deep-sea mineral deposits,
but [in]{.underline} more [[limited]{.mark} concentrations]{.underline}
or only in specific locations. Still [[other]{.mark} mineral[s]{.mark}
**critical**]{.underline} [to the **energy transition**]{.underline}
[[are not available]{.mark} **at all**]{.underline} [[in the]{.mark}
**deep [sea]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Even for some minerals that are present]{.underline} in large volumes
in seabed deposits, such as manganese, copper and nickel, deep-[sea
mining is **unlikely**]{.underline} [to be a critical
source]{.underline} of material for the clean energy transition [given
the large existing demand]{.underline} for those minerals in other
sectors of the economy.

Is deep-sea mining necessary for the clean energy transition?

The mere presence of critical minerals on the ocean floor -- even in
large volumes -- does not mean that exploiting those deposits is
necessary to advance the clean energy transition. [For deep-sea mining
to be essential]{.underline}, the [resources]{.underline} available [on
the seafloor would need to be significant in the context of **future
global demand**]{.underline} for those materials and production would
need to be able to ramp up quickly enough to close global supply gaps
that may emerge in the next decade, when options for expanding
terrestrial mining or reducing critical minerals demand through
technological advances or circular economy strategies are limited.

[The [only two metals]{.mark} for [which
**d**]{.mark}eep-**[s]{.mark}**ea **[m]{.mark}**ining [is
capable]{.mark}]{.underline} of making a significant dent in the market
[[are **cobalt** and **nickel**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[two]{.mark}
metals [for which]{.mark} **long-term [demand]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} the
**[most uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[**sufficient supply** \[is\] expected]{.mark} to serve **short-term
demand**]{.underline}" according to the International Energy Agency.134

Some critical minerals are available in only limited volumes on the
seabed

Deep-sea mining is promoted as a solution to the critical minerals
challenge, yet [only some critical minerals are present in
abundance]{.underline} on the seabed, [while others are]{.underline}
present only in more [limited]{.underline} quantities, or in specific
areas of the ocean.

Cobalt, copper and nickel supplies, as noted above, are present in
abundance in seafloor nodule deposits in the CCZ and elsewhere. The
European Academies Science Advisory Council anticipates that cobalt,
copper and nickel, along with manganese, are likely to be the economic
targets for mining of nodules and ferromanganese crusts, while copper,
along with zinc, silver and gold, will be the economic targets of
hydrothermal sulfide mining.136

Other critical minerals, however, are available in only more limited
volumes:

• **[Lithium]{.underline}** can be present in seafloor crusts and
nodules, but [is not generally considered a target of deep-sea
mining]{.underline}.137 A study produced for the International Seabed
Authority estimates that nodules in the CCZ possess less than one-fifth
the amount of lithium as is present in current global land-based
reserves.138 According to an Environmental Justice Foundation report,
"lithium is not currently targeted by the \[deep-sea mining\] industry
and, at trace levels, is not viable for extraction from polymetallic
nodules."139 Norway estimates that lithium resources on the seafloor in
its territorial waters equate to only about 1% of global land-based
reserves.140

• [**R**are **e**arth **e**lements]{.underline} [are present in varying
amounts]{.underline} in various seabed environments. Nodules in the CCZ
contain an amount of rare earth elements that is only a fraction of the
world's land-based reserves.141 Rare earths in the Prime Crust Zone in
the central Pacific Ocean represent a similar share of global land-based
reserves.142 [While concentrations of rare earth elements in
seafloor]{.underline} deposits [are low]{.underline}, [some]{.underline}
deposits [are]{.underline} particularly [rich in "heavy" rare
earth]{.underline} elements (such as dysprosium) [that are]{.underline}
potentially [of greater economic value]{.underline}.14

How important is energy as a share of overall mineral demand?

While the renewable energy transition will likely require significant
quantities of manganese and copper, [seabed [mining]{.mark} is [unlikely
to have]{.mark} a significant [impact]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on]{.mark}
the]{.underline} global [[supply]{.underline}]{.mark} picture [[for
**copper** and]{.mark} is not likely to be needed to satisfy
[**manganese** demand]{.mark}]{.underline} for the energy transition.

[[Copper]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Seabed mining is unlikely to have a
major impact on the global supply of copper in the near- to mid-term. A
study conducted for the International Seabed Authority estimates that,
[even with rapid deployment of deep-[sea mining]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the CCZ, [it [could only supply]{.mark} a maximum of the equivalent of
[**2%** of]{.mark} current **[land-based
production]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 2035.144

[[Manganese]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Similarly, while the energy
transition will likely require an increase in manganese use,145
[existing and planned land-based [resources]{.mark} are [forecast to
**meet demand**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near-term in all but the
highest demand cases.146 Other uses, not energy transition uses, would
likely drive any deep-sea mining for manganese. For example, The Metals
Company, which has proposed to begin mining for nodules in the CCZ, has
indicated that it wants the manganese for steel production.147

While [deep-sea mining]{.underline} does have the potential to produce
copper and especially manganese, it [will not produce
enough]{.underline} of the former [to make a dent in **global
markets**]{.underline}, and the latter is not likely to be in especially
short supply. Moreover, the widespread use of copper and manganese
throughout the economy provides an abundance of opportunities to manage
potential increases in demand resulting from the energy transition.

In sum, from the perspective of the clean energy transition, nickel and
cobalt are the metals that are likely to be economic targets of deep-sea
mining, but are not at great risk of short-term supply disruption; and
new nickel- and cobalt-free EV battery designs are rapidly gaining
market share, potentially reducing the importance of those metals for
the energy transition. [**R**are **e**arth **e**lements and
**lithium**]{.underline}, while extremely important to the clean energy
transition, [are unlikely to be produced in great abundance from
seafloor mining]{.underline}. Copper and manganese may be economic
targets for deep-sea mining, but deep-sea extraction of those metals is
not likely to be essential to meet the needs of the energy transition.

Can deep-sea mining address near-term shortages of critical minerals?

[The]{.underline} absolute [quantity of **critical
[minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[available [from
land]{.mark}]{.underline}-based resources [is [unlikely to be a
constraint]{.mark}]{.underline} on the clean energy transition, [at
least [through]{.mark} **[2050]{.mark}**]{.underline}.148 The major
challenges are bringing enough critical minerals to market fast enough
to support the dramatic ramp-up in clean energy proposed by many of the
world's nations to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels,
while limiting environmental impacts from any expansion of terrestrial
mining.

The period between now and 2035 is most critical. [Copper and nickel
mines require]{.underline} at least seven to **[eight
years]{.underline}**, [and sometimes **much longer**]{.underline} to
come online, [while lithium mines]{.underline} can take at [least four
to seven years]{.underline} to develop.150 [**Tech**nological
changes]{.underline} that could [dramatically **reduce demand** for
certain critical minerals]{.underline} -- [such as]{.underline} changes
in **[EV battery]{.underline}** [chemistries]{.underline} -- take at
least several years to roll out. While some circular economy strategies
-- such as product lifetime extension and repair -- can make an
immediate difference, others, such as recycling, require time to ramp up
and are only capable of making a limited difference in the short run as
the first generation of EV batteries and solar panels are now beginning
to reach the end of their useful lives.

Analysis produced for the International Seabed Authority and published
in 2022 concluded that cobalt and nickel were likely to experience
supply shortages toward the end of the 2020s, and in both cases, a rapid
ramp-up of nodule harvesting from the deep sea could meaningfully reduce
those shortages.151 [More **[recent analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline},
however, [[suggests]{.mark} that [neither **cobalt** nor
**nickel**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[are [likely to be at
risk]{.mark} for short-term **supply disruption**]{.underline}.152 Other
observers question the ability of deep-sea mining to make a meaningful
contribution to short-term supply challenges. The Energy Transitions
Commission concluded in 2023 that "initial production amounts \[from
deep-sea mining\] are likely to be low and not able to significantly
close supply gaps that might emerge by the late 2020s."153 The
assumption that deep-sea mining can come online quickly enough to
address any shortages is open to question.

The report produced for the ISA, and cited earlier, bases its
conclusions on the assumption that seabed mining production would begin
in 2027. However, there is no guarantee that seabed mining can or will
scale up that quickly. The Metals Company, which hopes to receive
permission to mine nodules in the CCZ, has stated that "we expect to be
in production in the fourth quarter of 2025 if the application \[to the
ISA\] is approved."154 While, as of early 2024, the ISA was targeting
2025 for the adoption of regulations on seabed mining, some analysts
argue that the number of outstanding regulatory issues to be resolved
makes such a timeline unrealistic.155

Meanwhile, markets for several critical minerals -- including nickel and
cobalt -- were no longer showing signs of shortage as of mid-2024,
instead surging into surplus, sending prices for those materials
tumbling.

During 2023 alone, [[cobalt prices fell]{.mark} by]{.underline} an
estimated **[[25%]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[nickel]{.underline}]{.mark}
prices [by **[45]{.mark}%**]{.underline} [and
[lithium]{.mark}]{.underline} carbonate prices [by]{.underline}
**[[70]{.mark}%]{.underline}**.157 Nickel production has increased,158
leading some analysts to forecast a surplus of nickel through at least
2028.159 Nickel producers have also expanded their capacity to process
low-grade nickel ore typically used in stainless steel to the
higher-purity metal required for EV batteries, adding additional
flexibility to nickel supplies.160

However, the [[impacts of deep-sea mining on climate]{.mark} are still a
subject of scientific and political debate]{.underline}. One 2020 study,
for instance, estimated that making one billion EV batteries from
nodules could reduce atmospheric CO2 by 11.5bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent
and said that nodules "put 94% less sequestered carbon at risk" than
land-based mining would. Another **[2020 study, however, stated that
"scientific [misconceptions]{.mark} are likely [leading to
miscalculations of]{.mark} the [environmental impacts]{.mark} of
deep-seabed mining]{.underline}**". It added that the **[[disturbance
from]{.mark} a [single]{.mark} mining [operation]{.mark} "could [easily
be"]{.mark} up to [four times larger than]{.mark} its [direct]{.mark}
mining [footprint]{.mark}, affecting up to 32,000 square kilometres over
20 years.]{.underline}** The potential **[cost of restoring damage to
deep-sea ecosystems could be "astronomical",]{.underline}** according to
a report by Planet Tracker, a not-for-profit thinktank. A 2022 UN
Environment Programme Finance Initiative **[(UNEPFI) briefing
paper]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[saw ["no foreseeable way" in
which]{.mark} the financing of [deep-sea mining could be]{.mark}
consistent with a [sustainable]{.mark} blue economy. I]{.underline}**t
called on investors to instead "focus efforts" on reducing "the
environmental footprint of terrestrial mining" and "support the
transition toward a circular economy" to make current mineral demand
"obsolete". A **[2023 study found that deep-sea mining "is unlikely to
resolve the sustainability challenges in the conventional mining
sector"]{.underline}** and any environmental impacts avoided on land
"would be at the expense of economic benefits in mining-reliant"
developing countries. At the same time, "next generation" batteries that
do not use cobalt, nickel and manganese are seeing rising investment
from manufacturers, potentially reducing the future need for these
metals. So far, BMW, Renault, Volkswagen, Volvo and Scania are among the
many automotive companies that have supported a moratorium on deep-sea
minerals in their supply chains. While General Motors and Tesla are both
exploring low- or no-cobalt batteries, shareholders of both companies
voted against proposals to agree to a moratorium on sourcing deep-sea
minerals for their EV battery systems. **[Deep-sea [mining]{.mark} can
[also harm]{.mark} marine [organisms]{.mark} that are [crucial for
climate regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[-- [those that store
carbon]{.mark} in the seabed or produce oxygen in the deep ocean.
Microbes and zooplankton, for instance, [play]{.mark} a "[crucial
role]{.mark} [in particulate organic carbon degradation]{.mark}".
However, biodiversity in the deep sea "is still poorly
characterised".]{.underline}** Diego Lillo Goffreri, an attorney in the
ecosystems programme at the Interamerican Association for Environmental
Defense (AIDA) and Latin America regional coordinator for the Deep Sea
Conservation Coalition (DSCC), tells Carbon Brief: "These studies
conclude that **[[removing]{.mark} the [sedimentary]{.mark} layer \[of
the ocean floor\] will [mean]{.mark} the [loss of absorption]{.mark}
capacity and the reincorporation [of CO2]{.mark} into the marine
environment."]{.underline}** Aside from sequestering carbon, the **[deep
sea may be relevant for oxygen production]{.underline}**. A 2024 study
found that polymetallic nodules may be responsible for producing oxygen
at the seafloor in the CCZ. The authors said that this oxygen production
could be critical for sustaining life at the seafloor. Goffreri says
that the new discovery significantly changes the cost-benefit analysis
of deep-sea mining. He adds: "Is economic value more important than
oxygen production? It's a finding that should be a game-changer."
Canada's The Metals Company, which partially funded the research,
"attempted to poke holes in the study", according to E\\&E News, but
researchers stood by their findings. Duncan Currie, an international
environmental lawyer with the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, tells
Carbon Brief: "It was a [real concern that The Metals Company was
adopting the position of questioning]{.underline} that Exxon has taken
on questioning \[peer-reviewed\] climate science and saying 'we're going
to be doing our own research'. "Will \[they\] hold off on filing
\[mining\] applications until their own research is published? They
didn't answer the question, but it's a really important \[one\] because
the science out there is saying there's totally new mind-blowing
discoveries being made." The Metals Company has said it is "preparing a
comprehensive rebuttal to contribute to the scientific literature" and
is "committed to scientific integrity and transparency, and will
continue to provide accurate, peer-reviewed research to enhance our
understanding of the deep sea". How does it impact global marine
biodiversity and coastal communities? [Once thought to be barren and
lifeless, the [seafloor is home to]{.mark} an [extraordinary and
delicate variety of life]{.mark} that is potentially [vulnerable
to]{.mark} mineral [mining.]{.mark}]{.underline} Seafloor communities at
water depths of 3,000 to 6,000 metres span more than 60% of Earth's
surface. For researchers to access the deep ocean and assess the impacts
of deep-sea mining is "really tricky", says Dr Kerstin Kröger, a
deep-sea ecologist advising the UK government on impacts of human
industrial activities in the deep sea. The costs and difficulty of
conducting research can be prohibitive, she tells Carbon Brief: "It's a
massive undertaking. In my opinion, we still do not have sufficient
scientific evidence to really understand the risks of deep-sea mining.
We need this to responsibly exploit these mineral resources." [Despite
this, scientists have already warned about the "inevitable" and "very
likely irreversible" loss of biodiversity]{.underline}, according to the
National Committee of the Netherlands of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). A 2020 opinion article by a diverse group
of marine scientists and published by PNAS **[argues that deep-sea
mining could also pose "significant risks" to deep midwater
ecosystem]{.underline}**s, which extend from depths of 200 metres to 5km
and connect shallow and deep-sea ecosystems. It states that **[mining
would disturb both biodiversity and ecosystem services, including carbon
export, nutrient regeneration and fish stocks.]{.underline}**

Promises---And Big Financial Risks,\" TIME, 3 August, 2023,
https://time.com/6301463/deep-sea-environment-financial-risk) KJ

At the last minute of the recent International Seabed Authority meeting
in Jamaica (which ended July 29), negotiators representing countries
around the world decided to postpone a decision on the most important
point of debate at the gatherings. That is, whether and how companies
can mine the bottom of the ocean for critical minerals needed for the
energy transition. The debate has largely centered on just how bad
deep-sea mining would be for underwater life. Opponents say that the
practice risks destroying untouched marine ecosystems; supporters argue
that the extraction technology is relatively light touch and that any
damage underwater would be better than damage to terrestrial ecosystems.
It is, at its core, a moral argument with the [**[economic]{.mark}**
[and **financial** **case** for deep-sea mining]{.mark} almost taken for
**granted**.]{.underline} So I want to take a minute here to look at
some of the economic and financial elements at play. Deep-sea mining is
one of many sectors in the clean technology space that should make
businesses and investors think differently about risks and returns.
[Deep-sea mining is [a **high**-**risk**, **high**-**reward**
**investment**]{.mark}. The [**technology** is **unproven**,]{.mark} and
some [experts]{.mark} have [argued]{.mark} [it will be **too**
**expensive**]{.mark} to compete in the current rare-earth-mineral
marketplace. [This]{.mark} [could]{.mark} very well [mean **financial**
**devastation** for the companies that pursue it]{.mark}. Still, it
seems fair to say that a significant potential financial---and
societal---upside remains if mining projects are well executed. As the
energy transition accelerates, the rapidly growing demand for critical
minerals like manganese and cobalt is enormous. That could mean returns
for investors and a vast supply of minerals for the green
economy.]{.underline} The high financial-risk-and-reward nature of
deep-sea mining isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. Indeed,
high-risk investments are often celebrated in the climate technology
space. Think of the investors who helped Tesla get off the ground---and
made a killing doing so---or the slew of startups financed by
high-profile investors like Bill Gates. To a certain extent, we need
investors who are willing to take on financial risk to help catalyze new
clean technologies. [But [there's]{.mark} [a **key**]{.mark} **way** in
which the **[downside]{.mark}** of **deep-sea mining** is **different**
from most other high-risk **investments**. In exploiting the ocean
floor, [mining companies open themselves]{.mark} [up to **enormous**
**environmental** **liability**]{.mark} that **extends** far **beyond**
many other **highly** **speculative** **investments**. Potentially
**dest[roying]{.mark}** [**marine** **ecosystems**, **contributing** to
species **extinction**]{.mark}, and destroying so-called natural capital
all have the potential to [**cause** **damage** that **costs** the
**planet** **trillions**]{.mark} of **dollars**.]{.underline} It's
[not]{.underline} [a big stretch to [imagine those **liability**
**costs** **exceeding**]{.mark} [the **value** **of** deep-sea mining
**companies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an extensive section of its
regulatory filings, The Metals Company, the best-known deep-sea mining
company, warns investors that [[environmental
rules,]{.underline}]{.mark} both those that exist [today and that may be
on the books soon, "**could** [**limit** or **prevent**]{.mark} our
[**ability** to **continue**]{.mark} our **[operations]{.mark}** as
currently contemplated or to undertake new operations." That's
particularly the case as policymakers push for new ways to account for
the value of natural capital. This includes things like biodiversity and
ocean life, which underpin our economy but aren't considered in our
traditional forms of accounting.]{.underline} An investor may look at
this and say, \"so what?\" Most venture investments don't pan out, and
it would be easy to write off an investment in a deep-sea mining company
if the economics don't work out. But [[there are **reputational**
**risks**, too]{.mark}, that could [**seriously** **impact** the

it surely won't be the only one with a similar risk-reward profile.
Geoengineering, for example, presents the opportunity to help humans
slow some of the effects of climate change---but the cost of the side
effects remain unknown. Sooner or later, these technologies may force
businesses and investors to weigh risks and returns a little
differently.

[Many countries have now set their sights on a **new market**: the deep
**ocean floor**.]{.underline} These depths potentially hold an untapped
trove of metals---nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese---tucked into
polymetallic nodules, potato-shaped deposits that are millions of years
old. Mining these riches, they say, is the key to a greener future. Some
are already fiddling with the lock. Last June, Nauru, a small Pacific
nation with a history of mining disasters, triggered a little-known
legal clause that effectively started a two-year countdown for deep-sea
mining to begin in international waters. With the clock ticking, the
International Seabed Authority (ISA), the body responsible for
regulating the industry, now has just over a year to finalize guidelines
for what could be the world's biggest mining opportunity. [The problem
is that]{.underline} **[[nobody]{.mark} [knows]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[for sure]{.underline} [[what]{.mark} the [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}
[of such a venture]{.underline} [would be---and]{.underline} **[not

[that have yet to be]{.underline} [identified.]{.underline} At this
point, they say, more time is needed to understand the risks of
mining---and what could be lost. "[We're talking about]{.underline}
[**[destroying]{.underline}** [huge parts of our
ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which play]{.underline} **[key
roles]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[climate
regulation]{.underline}**," [said Diva Amon, a deep-sea
biologist.]{.underline} "We would like the opportunity to explore that
so that we don't make the same mistakes that we have made previously in
terms of resource use on this planet." Andrew Sweetman, professor and
research leader at the Heriot-Watt University's Lyell Centre in
Edinburgh, Scotland, explains how samples are obtained from deep in the
ocean as part of research efforts to see the effects mining will have on
the Pacific Ocean's environment in San Diego on June 8, 2021. Carolyn
Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images The seafloor, thousands of feet
below the surface of the ocean, is a world shrouded in darkness---and
mystery. Concealed within these shadowy waters are creatures varying
from bioluminescent glass squids to bloodybelly comb jellies,
heart-shaped organisms that glow like string lights. Despite
encompassing 99 percent of the world's livable space, less than
one-fifth of the ocean is estimated to have been explored by scientists.
"We know more about the surface of Mars and the moon than we do of the
deep sea," said Arlo Hemphill, a senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace
USA. "Every single time we go down into the deep sea for research, new
discoveries are made." It could also be brimming with untapped riches.
The deep sea is estimated to hold billions of dry tons of polymetallic
nodules packed with cobalt, manganese, copper, and nickel, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey. Crucial to the lithium ion batteries that
power everything from electric vehicles to iPhones, these metals are in
high demand---and just one stretch of the seafloor could contain more
than can be found on land. The economics of extraction are murkier.
Proponents of mining say these deposits contain high grades of
metals---and significant quantities---making the deep seafloor an
attractive alternative to terrestrial mines. The Metals Company (TMC),
one of the main parties racing toward the deep sea, claims its contract
areas could contain enough metals for 280 million electric vehicles.
[But the]{.underline} **[[economic viability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
potential operations [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[still
unclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [especially]{.underline}
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[[technology]{.underline}]{.mark} [required]{.underline} [[is still
being]{.underline}]{.mark} [tested.]{.underline} "You've got very, very
good resources as long as that technology can be proved, and it's only
really once that technology is proved that we will fully understand the
economics," ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge told Foreign Policy.
"Until then, everything is a little bit speculative." Even if it seems
economically daunting, the potential bounty has long captivated nations
around the world. Provisions for deep-sea mining were included in the
1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and were
essentially codified in 1994 with the creation of the ISA, meant to draw
up mining regulations for the high seas, which is everything outside of
the 200-nautical mile (or 230-mile) exclusive economic zone that coastal
states are entitled to. Some 167 states have ratified UNCLOS; one
notable exception is the United States, which initially balked at the
constraints of ISA deep-sea mining rules and has since been hobbled by
domestic debates over sovereignty. The ISA currently prohibits countries
from mining, limiting them to exploration licenses. Still, the ISA's
very creation, long before there was even a deep-sea mining industry to
regulate, is in many ways a landmark event, said Jeroen Ingels, a marine
ecologist at Florida State University. "I can't think of any other
example where an industry is being regulated or at least the plan is
being set up to regulate it ... before it actually happens," he said.
"It's a huge opportunity." It will also be an enormous test of global
stewardship. With a mandate to act "for the benefit of mankind," the ISA
is designed to include both a benefits-sharing scheme that supports
developing countries as well as a compensation system for countries that
are economically reliant on terrestrial mining, many of which have
decried the two-year countdown to begin sea mining. "It really was this
dream of a clean new industry that is going to be sharing financial and
capacity benefits and know-how with all nations in the developing world.
That's this ideal," said Kristina Gjerde, a senior high seas advisor to
the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But the reality, she
said, has been uglier: "When you get down to the dirty reality, it's a
few companies from developed countries going under the guise of
developing countries because you have to have a state sponsor to get
access to the seafloor." (The United States, since it hasn't ratified
UNCLOS or joined the ISA, can't take part in the scramble.) Take Nauru,
the Pacific nation at the center of the two-year rush for the deep sea.
The island has a history of mining fiascos: Decades ago, Nauru was
embroiled in disastrous phosphate mining schemes that left it barren and
ultimately set it on a path toward economic freefall. It was in this
precarious financial state that Nauru teamed up with TMC, a Canadian
firm that has also partnered with Tonga and Kiribati. But their
relationship has raised questions about which party is actually in the
driver's seat and shaping the future of the deep-sea mining industry,
with TMC CEO Gerard Barron even standing in as the country's delegate in
an ISA meeting. "You have this really pretty absurd situation at the
moment where these countries arguably don't have effective control over
the entities that they are sponsoring," said Pradeep Singh, a research
associate at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies. "It's
not just the regulations we need to sort out. We need to sort out what
is going on here." [[The race]{.underline}]{.mark} [to tap the riches of
the seafloor]{.underline} [reflects the fundamental paradox of global
growth. To fight environmental problems, such as accelerating climate
change brought about by unchecked growth and consumerism, some say there
may be little alternative but to [court]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[fresh]{.underline}** [environmental **havoc**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"The world can't continue to support that level of consumerism without
consequence, and [the consequence we're seeing now is environmental
**degradation**]{.underline}, which may mean we need to create another
habitat to supply the minerals to stop environmental degradation," said
Andrew Sweetman, a professor of deep-sea ecology at Heriot-Watt
University. "It's so backwards, but this is where we are." The countries
and companies that have already funneled tens of millions of dollars
toward environmental impact assessments argue that extracting these
metals---all of which are required in electric vehicles and renewable
energy technologies---is crucial for the energy transition. "There's a
global need for metals," Barron, the CEO of TMC, told Foreign Policy.
"Decarbonizing the planet is very metal-intensive, and so what we've
been focused on is: Where can we find the supply of these important
battery metals with the lightest planetary and human impact?" But
[hundreds of scientists say that]{.underline}
**[understates]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}**
[involved]{.underline}. "[They]{.underline} [sort of]{.underline}
**[skip over]{.underline}** [the part that there are]{.underline}
**[serious]{.underline}** [environmental]{.underline}
[**[impacts]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [new
environment]{.underline} [that they're trying to seek to get the
minerals from," Gjerde said.]{.underline} What is known about the deep
sea suggests that [mining could have a]{.underline} [wide-ranging and
even **catastrophic**]{.underline} [impact]{.underline},
[unleashing]{.underline} **[pollution]{.underline}** [and**sediment
plumes**]{.underline} [that disrupt a fragile habitat teeming with
life]{.underline}. [Given how much of the deep sea is still unexplored,
they warn,]{.underline} [the world could **lose species**]{.underline}
[that still have yet to be named.]{.underline} "We're talking about
initiating a new inherently destructive industry in probably what's
among the most pristine settings on the planet," said Lisa Levin, a
professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and founder of the
Deep-Ocean Stewardship Initiative. The ISA says it will exercise strict
oversight over mining operations. "We have very strong legal powers
already, but we fully expect we'll be able to use those powers to
monitor activities," said Lodge, the ISA secretary-general. "We will put
in a lot of emphasis on remote monitoring." Sandor Mulsow, the former
head of the ISA's Office of Environmental Management and Mineral
Resources, is less optimistic. Since mining contractors are often
conducting their own environmental baseline studies, he said, "It is
like the wolf taking care of the sheep." With just a year left to
negotiate the details of what seabed mining regulation will look like,
there remain a host of thorny questions still unanswered, from the
economics of the new industry to its environmental impact to how the
novel benefits-sharing regime envisioned by the ISA will actually work.
But the clock is now ticking. "There are still far more questions than
answers in all of this mining equation," Amon said. "[The
trigger]{.underline} [really]{.underline} [[is quite
frankly]{.underline} **[irresponsibl]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**e**
because it is essentially forcing this process to move
forward]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [those
essential]{.underline} **[pieces]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[in
place]{.underline}**."

**[[Mining processes not only deplete minerals,
but]{.mark}]{.underline}** may also [**[impose severe damage to
natural]{.mark} landscapes and [resources ]{.mark}**[that are needed to
maintain everyday life]{.mark} both locally and
[globally]{.mark}.]{.underline} The modern type of mining, which often
requires open mines or mountain top removal, needs to recognize the
existence of biophysical limits to extraction in order to maintain
support from society -- locally and at other levels. [The renaissance of
mining industries has resulted in different types of conflict between
the mining industry and]{.underline} other interest groups, including
farmers, reindeer herders, local communities, environmental
non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) and [indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} These conflicts reflect diverging values,
knowledge, world views, and economic output. [[The mining
industry]{.underline},]{.mark} especially open pits and landfills,
[[have an extensive footprint and huge impact in]{.mark} landscapes and
[ecological systems]{.mark} at the local level. [Mining processes
necessitate intervention]{.mark} in natural landscapes [and]{.mark} may
also [lead to the degradation of the surrounding
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} in the form of mountain top removals,
deposits of mine cuttings, [[release of chemicals]{.mark} in soil and
water bodies such as rivers, lakes and fjords]{.underline}, and air
pollution. Consequently[, mining]{.underline} potentially [damages local
(including indigenous) ways of utilizing the landscape]{.underline} for
subsistence, livelihood, recreational purposes and the like (Iakovleva
et al. 2012). The cumulative and long term effects of these [processes
may turn mining sites into what has been called 'sacrifice
zones']{.underline} (Lerner 2010; Fox 1999). [[The **irreversible
effects of mineral extraction**]{.mark} on landscape, water reservoirs
and biodiversity make the areas unusable for other purposes in a
long-time perspective. Access to these areas, and their multiple use, is
set aside, or sacrificed, for present and future
generations.]{.underline} At the other end of the spectrum, recent
developments in global markets, including international standards for
sustainable mining, including certification, and ethical products such
as the Fairphone, may reflect an increasing awareness among consumers
about mining's environmental footprint. Concepts like corporate social
responsibility (CSR) and social license to operate (SLO) have also
pushed the agenda for positioning the mining industry in a wider
societal and cultural setting (Fonseca 2010; Koivurova et al. 2015). In
the Norwegian "green shift" discourse, minerals and metals are key
component in developing technologies for green energy and the
transformation to a low-carbon society. The batteries in a Tesla
electronic car demands 10 kg lithium, in addition to cobalt, nickel and
carbon. Copper is an essential component in wind turbines; solar cells
are made of silicon and rare earth metals (Andersen 2013; Svensen 2015).
Environmentally clean and low-carbon energy is in everyone's interests,
especially if we have the global aim of meeting the requirements set out
in the Paris agreement on the reduction of climate changing gases, which
was signed in 2015 and entered into force on November 4th, 2016. But who
wants to sacrifice their surroundings to serve these global purposes?
[**The land- scape may be changed forever**, water perhaps polluted, and
large volumes of crushed rock must be stored somewhere, in a fjord
tailing deposit or onshore, often **[lead]{.mark}ing [to irreversible
changes in]{.mark} ecosystems** and ecosystem services.]{.underline} The
dilemma is complex, and its implications diverse, and it is our opinion
that this diversity should be illuminated also from below, from the
viewpoint of stakeholders involved in or indeed influenced by it. Thus,
the future sustainable development of the EuroArctic region forms
multiple arenas and processes for planning. Debates about sustainable
mining are revealing conflicts both about how to define sustainability
and about the environmental impact of mining (Kirsch 2009;
Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2015; Leach et al. 1999). And not least the issue
reveals the way scale matters: [Can mining for minerals push the global
transition to a low-carbon society in the right direction, and at the
same time ensure sustainable development within **[Arctic mining
communities]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

The world is moving away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy
from the wind, sun and other sources. Many emerging energy technologies
-- from wind turbines to electric vehicles -- depend on so-called
"critical minerals" such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper and rare
earth elements. The growing demand for critical minerals is being used
to justify [[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining -- a new form of
mining that would **[jeopardize]{.mark} unique and [vital deep-sea
ecosystems]{.mark}** that science is just beginning to understand [as
well as]{.mark} the [health of]{.mark} the **[oceans at
large]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We don't need deep-sea mining to
transition to clean energy. There are many ways the U.S. and the world
can ensure that we have the critical minerals we need without doing
lasting damage to the world's last great wilderness -- including by
making better use of minerals we have already extracted from the Earth.
In fact, the world currently trashes more of some critical minerals in
discarded electronic waste each year than would likely be supplied
annually by a proposed ramp-up of deep-sea mining in the central Pacific
over the next decade. By building a "circular economy" for critical
minerals now -- one in which products are built responsibly and to last;
fixed when they break; and recycled into new products at the end of
their lives -- we can reduce the pressure for all forms of mineral
extraction, including deep-sea mining, and lay the foundation for a
sustainable energy system for decades to come. Why is deep-sea mining so
dangerous? The deep ocean seabed is a vibrant, biodiverse place, teeming
with complex ecosystems and thousands, possibly millions of species,
including deep-sea corals, anemones, sponges and many more that
scientists are only now beginning to learn about. [Deep-sea mining
operations could [take place **over hundreds to thousands of square
miles of seafloor**]{.mark}**,** [harming]{.mark} not only the [species
that live there]{.mark}, but **[broader ocean ecosystems]{.mark}** as
well. The plumes of kicked-up sediment and discharged mining waste from
deep-sea mineral extraction could have **extensive and wide-ranging
impacts on ocean ecosystems** -- traveling huge distances from mining
sites. [Deep-ocean ecosystems]{.mark} are especially [vulnerable
to]{.mark} the kind of [disruption caused by mining]{.mark} the
seafloor. Species living in deep-sea environments are frequently
long-lived and slow to grow, and **[previous d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining trials** have [shown]{.mark} that areas of [seafloor
disrupted by mining]{.mark} are **[slow to recover]{.mark}**. In some
cases, **[damage]{.mark}** from deep-sea mining could be all but
**[irreversible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Deep sea mining is ramping up and will crush ocean ecosystems

**Steiner '17** \[Dr. Richard G. Steiner; Former Marine Conservation
Professor with the University of Alaska; 12/6/2017;acc. 6/27/2025;
Huffington Post, "Deep Sea Mining a New Ocean Threat,"
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deep-sea-mining-new-threa_b_8334428\] cdo

**[Extensive]{.underline}** [deep sea]{.underline} [mineral exploration
is]{.underline} **[currently underway]{.underline}** [in international
waters]{.underline} governed by the International Seabed Authority
(ISA), under the U.N. Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and within
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of many coastal nations. There are
currently three main types of deep sea mineral deposits of interest to
industry and governments: 1. Polymetallic nodules (also called
"manganese nodules") are potato-sized metal nodules found on the abyssal
plain from 4,000 m - 6,000 m deep. These nodules are rich in manganese,
nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, molybdenum, iron, and Rare Earth
Elements. Nodules grow slowly over millions of years, to diameters from
5 cm - 50 cm, and host unique invertebrate communities. Currently, 13
national consortia operate exploration leases on 4.5 million km2 of the
Clarion-Clipperton (Fracture) Zone (CCZ), between Baja and Hawaii. The
U.S., as a non-party to UNCLOS and ISA, issued exploration leases on its
own to Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), a subsidiary of defense contractor
Lockheed Martin, to explore for nodules in the CCZ. The only nodule
deposits being seriously considered within a national EEZ at present are
in the Cook Islands in South Pacific. 2. Seafloor Massive Sulphide (SMS)
deposits are found beneath deep sea hydrothermal vents along the 67,000
km of volcanically active mid-ocean ridges and back arc basins, between
1,500 m - 5,000 m deep. These contain high-grade copper, gold, silver,
zinc, and other trace metals. Deep sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems were
first discovered in 1977 at the Galapagos Rift, and stunned the world of
science, as these vent systems rely entirely on chemosynthesis rather
than photosynthesis - the first ever known. Over 300 deep sea vent
systems have been discovered so far, and it is estimated that perhaps
only 500 - 5,000 may exist in the world ocean, making this one of rarest
ecosystems in Earth's biosphere. China and Korea hold contracts to
explore SMS deposits in international waters of the Indian Ocean, and
Russia and France hold exploration leases on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Other SMS deposits being considered are in waters of Papua New Guinea
(PNG), Vanuatu, Palau, Niue, Fiji, Micronesia, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
and New Zealand. The Nautilus Minerals "Solwara 1" project in PNG waters
is fully permitted, the mining ship and equipment are being built, and
mining is scheduled to begin in 2018. This would be the first commercial
deep sea mining project in history. 3. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts
are found on summits and flanks of seamounts at 400 m - 4,000 m depth.
There are some 10,000 seamounts in oceans rising at least 1,000 m above
the seabed (and perhaps another 90,000 smaller seamounts). Many are in
EEZs of central Pacific islands (Federated States of Micronesia,
Marshall Islands, Hawaii, Johnston Atoll), and in international waters
of the tropical Pacific. Metal crusts form on shoulders of seamounts,
rich in cobalt, nickel, copper, iron, manganese; rare metals such as
tungsten, platinum, bismuth, tellurium, etc.; and Rare Earth Elements.
Crusts grow slowly, 1 mm - 5 mm per million years, and can reach total
thickness of up to 260 mm. Seamount crusts are currently being explored
by China and Japan in international waters of the western tropical
Pacific, but many feel actual mining of seamount crusts would be by far
the most problematic and least feasible. Marine phosphate (fertilizer)
and methane hydrate (energy) resources found in shallower waters, 100
m - 500 m deep, are often discussed in context with deep sea minerals.
Marine phosphate mining is in consideration off Namibia (currently under
moratorium), New Zealand (the environmental permit was denied earlier
this year, but the developer is considering reapplying next year), and
off Baja Mexico, where Odyssey Marine has submitted its EIA for mining
the Don Diego phosphate deposit in 70 m water depth, 12-25 miles
offshore. Japan has successfully tested methane hydrate, or "fire ice,"
extraction from its offshore waters. [But here's the
problem.]{.underline} [The deep ocean, where mining is proposed,
constitutes the largest]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [least
understood]{.underline} [biological]{.underline} [habitat on
Earth]{.underline}. It's an Alice-in-Wonderland world of extremes,
extraordinary adaptions, bizarre organisms, beauty and mystery. The
region is characterized by darkness (infused with sparkling
bioluminescence), extreme pressure, cold temperatures, high biodiversity
(perhaps millions of species, most yet to be identified), slow growth
and reproductive rates, and high sensitivity to disturbance (low
resilience). [Given]{.underline} [our]{.underline} **[poor
understanding]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [deep
seaecosystems,]{.underline} **[growing]{.underline}**
**[industrial]{.underline}** [**interest**,]{.underline} [**rudimentary
management**,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [**insufficient protected
areas**, the]{.underline} [risk of]{.underline}
**[irreversible]{.underline}** **[environmental damage]{.underline}**
[here]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[real]{.underline}**.
[Environmental risks]{.underline} [and impacts of]{.underline} [deep
sea]{.underline} [mining]{.underline} [would be]{.underline}
**[enormous]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**unavoidable**,
including]{.underline} [seabed habitat degradation over vast ocean
areas,]{.underline} [**species extinctions**, reduced habitat
complexity,]{.underline} [slow and uncertain recovery, suspended
sediment plumes, toxic plumes from surface ore dewatering, pelagic
ecosystem impacts, undersea noise, ore and oil spills in transport, and
more]{.underline}. [Due to the global rarity of]{.underline} [deep
sea]{.underline} [hydrothermal vent ecosystems, the impact of vent
mining would be]{.underline} **[disproportionately high]{.underline}**
[relative to terrestrial mining]{.underline}. Full-scale nodule mining
on the abyssal plain would affect thousands of square miles of ocean
floor, kill attached invertebrate communities, and create huge subsea
sediment plumes that would flow and settle over thousands of square
miles of seafloor. Such sedimentation would smother seabed habitat,
reduce habitat complexity and biodiversity over vast areas, and
post-mining recovery would be extremely slow. [Mining]{.underline} [of
cobalt crusts on]{.underline} [seamounts would cause]{.underline}
**[enormous, possibly irreversible]{.underline}**
**[impacts]{.underline}** [to unique, productive seamount]{.underline}

#### Deep Sea REM mining hurts Bio-D and seafloor ecosystems

Parliament
https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2024/757616/EPRS_ATA(2024)757616_EN.pdf)

[The deep sea is a vast habitat. [Tens of thousands of species have been
found in the deep ocean, and]{.mark} some experts estimate that [there
could be millions more.]{.mark}]{.underline} Several studies on deep-sea
mining financed by the EU (through its framework programmes for research
and innovation) show that [our current understanding of the functioning
and recoverability of the deep-sea ecosystem is still very limited, and
that there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of mining on
these processes.]{.underline} [Experts fear that **[disturbing these
habitats through seabed mining could severely alter the ecosystem,
resulting in catastrophic and permanent consequences for the ocean\'s
biodiversity]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Mining operations could harm
organisms]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in various ways, including: (i) direct
contact with heavy mining equipment on the seabed (sediment plumes);
(ii) warm mining wastewater (overheating and poisoning); (iii) noise and
light pollution (feeding and reproduction of species); (iv) habitat
removal (polymetallic nodules).]{.underline} Apart from the specific
seabed areas, however, [there are fears that [the practice may impact
the wider fishing industry]{.mark}, as waste discharge from mining
vessels could spread over large distances, and threaten open ocean fish
and invertebrates. Furthermore, the [facilities to process]{.mark} and
ship these [materials could affect coastal
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lastly, the ocean is considered to be
the world\'s largest carbon sink, absorbing around 25 % of all carbon
dioxide emissions. Microscopic organisms play a critical role in this
context, helping to sequester carbon in the deep sea and reduce
emissions of other planet-warming gases, such as methane, from seabed
sediments[. **[The alteration of the]{.mark} seabed [ecosystem following
mining activity may impact the ocean\'s carbon cycle and reduce its
ability to help mitigate global temperature rise.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Affected, 2022. Based on "base" (six contractor) scenario. E-waste
estimates: Cornelis P. Baldé et al., International Telecommunication
Union and United Nations Institute for Training and Research, Global
E-Waste Monitor 2024, 2024. By building a "circular economy" for
critical minerals now -- one in which products are built responsibly and
to last; fixed when they break; and recycled into new products at the
end of their lives -- we can reduce the pressure for all forms of
mineral extraction, including deep-sea mining, and lay the foundation
for a sustainable energy system for decades to come.

**Why is deep-sea mining so dangerous? **

The deep ocean seabed is a vibrant, biodiverse place, teeming with
complex ecosystems and thousands, possibly millions of
species, including deep-sea corals, anemones, sponges and many more that
scientists are only now beginning to learn about. Deep-sea mining
operations could take place over hundreds to thousands of square miles
of seafloor, harming not only the species that live there, but broader
ocean ecosystems as well. The plumes of kicked-up sediment and
discharged mining waste from deep-sea mineral extraction could have
extensive and wide-ranging impacts on ocean ecosystems -- traveling huge
distances from mining sites. Deep-ocean ecosystems are especially
vulnerable to the kind of disruption caused by mining the seafloor.
Species living in deep-sea environments are frequently long-lived and
slow to grow, and previous deep-sea mining trials have shown that areas
of seafloor disrupted by mining are slow to recover. In some cases,
damage from deep-sea mining could be all but irreversible. NOAA \|
Public Domain Recent research indicates that ferromanganese nodules are
important breeding grounds for these newly discovered deep-sea octopods
nicknamed "Casper," due to their likeness to the friendly cartoon ghost.

**We don't need deep-sea mining for the energy transition**

Deep-sea mining is not a potential source of all the critical minerals
required for the clean energy transition. Key minerals such as graphite
aren't available on the seafloor at all, and others -- such as lithium
and rare earth minerals -- are available only in limited quantities or
in specific areas of the ocean.  Cobalt, nickel and copper are among the
minerals believed to be available in the greatest abundance in deep-sea
deposits. [New designs for electric vehicle batteries]{.mark}, however,
[are reducing the need for cobalt and nickel]{.mark}, while the amount
of copper available in seafloor deposits is just a small fraction of
what is available from land-based resources. [Analysts agree that
land-based resources are sufficient to meet future demand for critical
minerals for the energy transition]{.mark}. Opening up the deep ocean
seafloor to destructive mining is a choice humanity can make. But there
are other options -- including making sure that we get everything
possible out of every pound of minerals we extract from the Earth.

**How can the "5 Rs" help meet the critical minerals challenge? **

America and the world can reduce the amount of critical minerals we need
for the energy transition -- and do so quickly -- by prioritizing the "5
Rs": the traditional 3 Rs of **reduce**, **reuse**, **recycle**,
plus **reimagining** products to last longer and use fewer critical
minerals, and **repairing** them when they break.  [Analysts]{.mark}
ranging from the International Energy Agency to the Energy Transitions
Commission [agree that]{.mark} these and other ["circular economy"
strategies can significantly reduce demand for critical minerals]{.mark}
over the next decade and beyond. [The Energy Transitions Commission
found]{.mark} in [2023 that circular economy strategies could** fully
close projected supply gaps for copper and nickel**]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} significantly [narrow them for lithium, cobalt and
neodymium]{.mark} by 2030.** Here are just a few of the ways that the "5
Rs" can help meet the critical minerals challenge:

**[The first step to solving the critical minerals challenge: Stop
throwing them away]{.mark}**

America has a large, homegrown source of critical minerals in the
products we use every day -- including electronic devices such as
smartphones, laptops, earbuds and disposable electronics such as
disposable e-cigarettes ("vapes").  Many of these electronics have short
lifespans -- from a few years for smartphones to a few days for
disposable vapes. And when they reach the end of their lives, the
critical minerals in many of those electronics wind up in our
trash. **America produces roughly 47 pounds of electronic waste per
person each year, with more than 3 million tons of American e-waste
going unrecycled annually. ** [Extending the lifetimes of electronics,
clean energy technologies and other products]{.mark} throughout our
economy [can reduce demand for critical minerals]{.mark} at a time of
rapidly growing demand. [Extending the lifetime of a product by 50% can
reduce material needs by]{.mark} as much as [a third]{.mark}; [doubling
a product's lifetime can reduce]{.mark} material [needs by as much as
50%.]{.mark}

**[Federal and state governments should take action to stop deep-sea
mining and build a sustainable circular economy for critical
minerals.]{.mark} ** The U.S. Congress should institute a precautionary
pause or moratorium on seabed mining in U.S. territorial waters and on
processing of minerals obtained by seabed mining in U.S. states or
territories. The U.S. should also provide diplomatic support for efforts
to adopt a precautionary pause or moratorium on deep-sea minerals
production in international waters. [State and federal governments
should adopt "right to repair" legislation to make it easier to fix the
stuff we use]{.mark}; [ban disposable and irreparable small
electronics]{.mark} such as disposable vapes; [create standards to help
consumers identify more durable and fixable products]{.mark}; [and
encourage "second-life" applications for clean energy technologies
approaching the end of their useful lives.]{.mark} Governments should
invest in improved standards and infrastructure for recycling,
especially for e-waste; investigate opportunities for environmentally
responsible use of industrial waste streams for critical minerals; and
take steps to make every part of our economy more energy efficient and
less material intensive. Governments should improve environmental
protections for terrestrial mining; and governments, companies and
consumers should advocate for the adoption and enforcement of global
standards for environmental and social responsibility in mining.

deep sea]{.underline}]{.mark} was once thought to be devoid of life ---
too dark, cold and starved of food for anything to survive --- we now
know that [it [is the largest habitable space on the planet]{.mark} and
home to a dazzling array of life. To date**, tens of thousands of
species have been found in the deep ocean**]{.underline}. Estimates say
there could be millions more[. [**In the Clarion-Clipperton Zone
alone**, a key area of interest for deep-sea mining, **researchers
have**]{.mark} **recently [discovered over 5,000 species]{.mark}**
**that were entirely new to science**.]{.underline} \<\<image

the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. [Thousands of previously unknown deep-sea
species have already been discovered in this area, which some seek to

With exploration and testing still in the early stages, [further
research is needed to determine the possible ecological impacts of
deep-sea mining. But the science to date paints a concerning picture.
**[Direct harm to marine life]{.mark}:**]{.underline} [[There is a high
likelihood that]{.mark} less mobile [deep-sea organisms would be killed
through]{.mark} direct contact with heavy [mining equipment]{.mark}
deployed on the seabed, [and]{.mark} that organisms would be smothered
and suffocated by the [sediment plumes]{.mark} these machines are likely
to create. Warm mining wastewater could also kill marine lifethrough
overheating and poisoning. **[Long-term species and ecosystem
disruption]{.mark}**: Mining activities could impair the feeding and
reproduction of deep-sea species through the creation of intense noise
and light pollution in a naturally dark and silent
environment.]{.underline} For example, [the sound pollution from these
activities could negatively impact large mega-fauna like whales,
[posing]{.mark} further [risk to populations already strained by climate
change]{.mark} and other human activities.]{.underline} Because many
deep-sea species are rare, long-lived and slow to reproduce, and because
polymetallic nodules (which may take millions of years to develop to a
harvestable size) are an important habitat for deep-sea species,
[[scientists are]{.mark} fairly [certain that]{.mark} some [species
would face extinction from habitat removal due to mining]{.mark}, and
that **[these ecosystems would require]{.mark} extremely [long time
periods to recover, if ever.]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[Possible impacts
on fishing and food security:]{.underline}** [It\'s not just the
seafloor that\'s at risk.]{.underline} Under current designs, [[waste
discharge]{.mark} from mining vessels [could spread over large
distances]{.mark}, potentially kilometers away from the areas being
mined. This may pose a threat to open ocean fish and invertebrates which
are crucial to international fisheries]{.underline} --- such as tuna
stocks that help drive the economies of small island developing states
like Kiribati, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands. [Effects of this mining
waste could include suffocation, damaged respiratory and feeding
structures, and disrupted visual communication within and amongst
species, alongside changes in the oxygen content, pH, temperature and
toxicity of seawater.]{.underline} However, more research is needed on
the characteristics of the discharge plumes themselves and the tolerance
of ocean species to fully understand these impacts[. **Social and
governance risks**: While extraction would occur offshore, the [deep-sea
mining industry would still need shoreline facilities]{.mark} for
processing and transshipment of material. This would [require land
acquisition]{.mark} and development, [which has historically driven
habitat loss]{.mark} affecting coastal communities that depend on marine
resources]{.underline}. Though the UN has designated high-seas minerals
\"the common heritage of \[hu\]mankind\" and declared that any mineral
extraction should benefit all nations, the current regulatory regime of
the ISA appears to promote the flow of mining profits to developed
states, or to shareholders of mining companies, rather than being
inclusive of developing nations. [**Potential climate impacts:** [The
ocean]{.mark} is the world\'s largest carbon sink**, [absorb]{.mark}ing
[around 25% of all carbon dioxide emissions]{.mark}**. **[Microscopic
organisms play a critical role in this climate-regulating
system]{.mark}**, helping to sequester carbon in the deep sea and reduce
emissions of other planet-warming gases (such as methane) from seabed

**[[Mining]{.mark} processes not only [deplete minerals]{.mark}, but may

[landscapes]{.mark} and resources]{.underline}** that are needed to

[environmental]{.mark} non-governmental organizations (E[NGO]{.mark}s)

[mining [industry]{.mark},]{.underline} especially open pits and
landfills, [have]{.mark} an [[extensive footprint]{.mark} and huge
[impact in landscapes]{.mark} and ecological systems at the local level.
Mining]{.underline} processes necessitate intervention in natural
landscapes and may also lead to the [[degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}
of the surrounding environment in the form of mountain top removals,
deposits of [mine cuttings]{.underline}, [[release of
chemicals]{.underline}]{.mark} in soil and water bodies such as rivers,
lakes and fjords, and [[air pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Consequently, mining potentially [[damages local]{.mark} (including
[indigenous]{.mark}) [way]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} of utilizing
the landscape for subsistence, livelihood, recreational purposes and the
like (Iakovleva et al. 2012). The cumulative and long term effects of
these processes may turn mining sites into what has been called
'sacrifice zones' (Lerner 2010; Fox 1999). The [[irreversible

[Rare earth elements (REEs) are important raw materials for green
technologies. However[, **REE mining**]{.mark} **and production [uses
techniques that are often not environmentally
sustainable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a
well-recognized method for evaluating the environmental impacts of
products and technologies. This article provides an overview of the
environmental impacts based on published LCA results of primary REE
production. Existing major REE deposits (Bayan Obo in China, Mountain
Pass in the United States, Mount Weld in Australia, ion- adsorption
deposits in several Chinese southern provinces) and currently possible
production routes are compared. Alternative minerals, such as eudialyte,
are also discussed. The article shows which [environmental effects can
be minimized by technology optimization and environmental safety
strategies.]{.underline} Additionally[, [some]{.mark} of the
[environmental impacts]{.mark} discussed, [may be difficult to
mitigate]{.mark}, as they depend on the mineral type.]{.underline}
Activities along the complex process chain of **[[REEs
production]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [**[have]{.mark} particularly
[high environmental impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} are identified. Ever
since the increasing importance of rare earth elements (REEs) for green
technologies, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, and low-energy
lighting, there has been a parallel discussion concerning environmental
impacts caused by the mining and production of REEs. The growing
interest was disclosed in a recent review of life cycle assessment (LCA)
studies,1 which have their focus on environmental impacts of REE
production. In the last five years, at least 27 studies were conducted
evaluating environmental impacts of various REE products and supply
chains. For example, Schulze et al.2 and Deng and ­ Kendall3 considered
REE production from ion- adsorption clays (IACs), Marx et al.4 and Arshi
et al.5 com- pared REE production from various mineral types, Vahidi and
Zhao analyzed in particular the separation of REEs through solvent ­
extraction6 and the production of RE metals via molten salt
electrolysis,7 and Schreiber et al.1 published a comprehen- sive review
of LCA activities involving primary REE produc- tion. Though detailed
industry data are normally not available, LCA studies provide sufficient
insight in the cause-and-effect chains to allow a basic evaluation of
various primary REE supply routes. Like all material processing, [**[the
REE supply chain is also associated with environmental
impacts]{.mark}.** They are mainly related to the geology of a deposit,
mineral type and composition, the [methods of extraction]{.mark}, local
supply of energy and auxiliary materials, [and regulatory
conditions]{.mark} that mitigate environmental impacts. Hence, the
environmental impacts vary consider- ably.]{.underline}

recycling and reduce]{.mark} the [exploitation of]{.mark} finite
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economists also project far-reaching
consequences for the industries and communities that depend on a healthy
ocean if deep seabed mining goes ahead. The International Seabed
Authority---the agency that, paradoxically, is responsible for licensing
deep seabed mining operations while also protecting the ocean from its
impact---has proven itself unfit for purpose. We need to change course
immediately, before irreparable damage is done. What's urgently needed
is a global moratorium on all deep seabed mining activities. Ultimately,
[moving to a low-carbon future will require major structural changes in
our economy and in our lifestyles---**not** a **rush** to exploit more
finite resources]{.underline}. Advocating for a moratorium Fortunately,
the voices speaking out against a move to mine the deep are growing in
volume and number. Calls for a moratorium are increasing, with local and
international NGOs, community leaders, scientists, governments,
businesses and fishers' organizations leading the way. WWF is proud to
take this stand for our ocean, alongside a global coalition of
individuals, businesses and governments. Businesses such as Google,
Volvo Group, BMW, VW Group, Scania and Patagonia are all calling for a
moratorium and have committed not to source minerals from the deep sea.
Investors are beginning to see that this industry is not a sustainable
or responsible investment proposition. [[Growing demand]{.mark} for
metals and minerals [**doesn't** **have** **to** **cost** the
Earth]{.mark}. [Alternative solutions]{.mark} already [exist]{.mark}: a
combination of [innovation, recycling and repair can]{.mark}
[satisfy]{.mark} industries' [needs]{.mark} for raw materials without
opening the seafloor to mining]{.underline}. [[The journey]{.mark}
toward a more sustainable future [begins]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a simple
decision: [**no** **deep** **seabed** **mining**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is now a question of what reaches the ocean floor first: protection
in the form of a global moratorium, or the mining bulldozers. WWF is
working across sectors to propose the following solutions to avoid deep
seabed mining: Businesses can source the materials they need through
more conventional, less destructive means of extraction and invest in
innovation, recycling and repairability. Consumers can recycle their old
phones, reduce consumption and investigate where their materials come
from. Governments can support a global moratorium on deep seabed mining
and investx in the circular economy.

[In the past decade, **a global narrative shift towards a green energy
transition**, driven by the imperative to combat climate change, has
sparked a heightened interest in mining operations for minerals such as
lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements necessary for renewable
energy technologies, electric vehicles, and lowcarbon solutions**. The
Arctic**, known to possess substantial mineral reserves**, has become a
focal point for these mining activities**. Thus, the hunt for energy
resources in the Arctic continues. Various countries are trying to
legitimize their Arctic interests by promoting their
'Arctic-ness']{.underline} through narratives of historical
relationships, typically related to transport, logistics, collaboration,
presence, trade, or others. While the green transition represents a
crucial step towards a sustainable future, it can potentially have
signifcant negative implications for the Arctic region. [[The Arctic
ecosystems are highly sensitive to disturbances]{.mark}, and [increased
mining activities]{.mark} can [introduce pollutants]{.mark} and alter
the natural landscape, [affect]{.mark}ing [Arctic flora and
fauna]{.mark}. [The loss of biod]{.mark}iversity [and]{.mark} the
disruption of [food chains can have]{.mark} farreaching [consequences

depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods]{.underline} (see
Zimmermannm et al., 2023). [[Mining activities furthermore]{.mark}

impact on indigenous communities]{.mark} residing in the
Arctic]{.underline}, which often have deep cultural and A. M. Hansen and
J. D. Tàbara 291 spiritual ties to the land (Hansen et al., 2016).
Hence, there is a need to shift from narrow policy and technological
discussions on energy transitions to broader full systems
transformations linking local interventions with a global systems' lens
(Tàbara et al., 2021). [[The growing influx of mining operations]{.mark}
can [lead to socio-cultural disruptions, increased pressure on
resources, and potential conficts over land use]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is essential to engage and consult with these communities to ensure
their rights, traditional knowledge, and well-being are respected
throughout the mineral extraction process. Acknowledging the unique
challenges faced by Arctic communities in relation to the development
and extraction of the resources for the green transition and the need to
recognize their unique role in supporting global sustainability futures,
it is crucial to prioritize their inclusion in decision-making processes
and policy formulation. Empowering these communities with resources and
knowledge to adapt to and mitigate climate change while preserving their
cultural heritage and traditional knowledge, is of paramount importance.
On the one hand, [transitioning to sustainable **[energy alternatives

disruption of the ocean floor**

Although more research is needed on the (long-term) impact of deep sea
mining, [scientists continue to warn there are serious concerns over the
multiple impacts the activity would have.]{.underline} [The [most direct
impact from]{.mark}]{.underline} [[deep-sea mining would be]{.mark} the
[loss of species and]{.mark} the fragmentation or [loss of
ecosystem]{.mark} structure and function.]{.underline} The noise of the
machinery would affect wildlife, the scraping off of the seabed would
kill animals and plants, and the sediment plumes smother and impact
marine life of all zones of the ocean. [The [damage caused]{.mark} to
the deep-sea ecosystems [would]{.mark} most likely [be
permanent]{.mark}.]{.underline} Deep-sea mining would also affect the
higher ocean levels. Cumulative pressures from overfishing, climate
change and pollution are putting the oceans and all marine life at risk
of collapse. [Deep-sea mining is a relatively new addition to the list
of threats facing the oceans, but their effects could be
catastrophic]{.underline}. Scientists have divided the ocean into five
main layers, known as "zones". The surface layer of the ocean is known
as the epipelagic zone and extends from the surface to 200 meters. It is
also known as the sunlight zone because this is where most of the
visible light exists. With the light comes heat. According to the UN
Environmental Programme (UNEP), 60% of the world's major marine
ecosystems in the sunlight zone have been degraded or are being used
unsustainably. Since the 1980's an estimated 20% of global mangroves
have been lost and 19% of coral reefs have disappeared. IUCN has
assessed that nearly 10% [([over 1,550]{.mark} of the 17,903 marine
animals and plants assessed) of [global marine species are at risk of
extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline} As we dive deeper into largely
unexplored places, the temperature drops and the pressure increases at
an astounding rate. At the most extreme depths where light can no longer
penetrate, some of the most bizarre and fascinating creatures in the sea
can be found. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is working on a
Mining Code deep-sea mining international waters. In 2024, the member
states of the ISA Assembly will meet to discuss the impact deep-sea
mining would have on the marine environment. Many experts hope this will
lead to a 'precautionary pause' or moratorium. To date, 24 countries

Life in the Ocean Is Threatened as Never Before -- with Immense
Consequences

[Humans]{.underline} [have historically viewed the ocean
as]{.underline} **[so immense]{.underline}** that [it
is]{.underline} an **[inexhaustible]{.underline}** source of resources
and dumping grounds, impervious to our actions. [People
have]{.underline} [**depend**ed]{.underline} **[on marine
resources]{.underline}** **[throughout]{.underline}** human **[history]{.underline}**.
In just the last half-century, however, developments in technology,
wasteful practices and the explosive growth in human consumption as
reflected in humanity's demand on the biosphere have
combined [to]{.underline} **[deplete
and]{.underline}** **[disrupt]{.underline}** **[life
in]{.underline}** **[the ocean]{.underline}** [to the extent
that]{.underline} marine life
and **[our]{.underline}** **[own]{.underline}** **[future]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [now]{.underline} [at
stake]{.underline}. The individual and cumulative impacts of activities
on and in the ocean -- fishing, aquaculture, coastal development, oil,
gas and mineral extraction, some kinds of recreation and shipping --
interact with and exacerbate the impacts of land-based activities
ranging from agriculture to energy production. Collectively, they are
taking a significant toll on life in the ocean. As humans have become
better at exploiting ocean and planetary resources, threats to ocean
life and habitats have accelerated.

[If we]{.underline} **[continue on]{.underline}** [**this trajectory**,
we]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} **[losing]{.underline}** [not
only]{.underline} **[entire]{.underline}** **[species
and]{.underline}** [**habitats**, but]{.underline} **[also the
life-support services humans require
from]{.underline}** [healthy]{.underline} **[ocean]{.underline}** [ecosystem**s**.
The ocean provides]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [**wealth of services**,
including]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** production, **[fibre]{.underline}**, **[medicines]{.underline}**, **[coastal]{.underline}** [protection]{.underline}, **[water]{.underline}** **[purification]{.underline}**, **[carbon
sequestration]{.underline}**, **[climate

product]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[interactions

The world is moving away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy

for critical minerals is being [used to justify deep-sea mining]{.mark}

**[vital deep-sea ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that science is
just beginning to understand as well [as the **health of the oceans** at

world can ensure that we have the **critical minerals** we need without
doing lasting damage to the world's **last great

we have already extracted from the Earth. In fact, [[the world currently
trashes more of some **critical minerals** in discarded electronic

A new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences shows that [less biodiversity in an area increases **the
risk of a domino effect** of extinctions]{.underline}, where one
species' disappearance can cause other species to follow suit. [The
[research]{.mark}]{.underline}, conducted by ecologists at the
University of Exeter, [[shows that losing a species]{.mark} in an area
is dangerous in that it [makes the surrounding ecological
community]{.mark} simpler, and therefore [less robust to
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. It makes sense: [the fewer species that
exist in an area]{.underline}, [the [fewer]{.mark} that [are available
to "fill the gap"]{.mark} left by other extinctions]{.underline}. [Other
species in the ecosystem will have fewer alternatives to turn
to]{.underline}. For example, [if there are fewer insects left overall
across a region]{.underline}, [the bats and amphibians that eat them
will feel the loss of just one species much more severely]{.underline}.
"[Interactions between species are important for ecosystem
stability]{.underline}," said Dirk Sanders, lead author and professor in
Exeter's Center for Ecology and Conservation, in a news release. "And
[because **[species are interconnected]{.mark}** through multiple
interactions]{.underline}, [an impact on [one]{.mark} species can
[affect others]{.mark} as well]{.underline}." The Exeter team
investigated this idea by removing a species of wasp from test
ecosystems. In many of these systems, [the wasp's disappearance caused
indirect extinctions of other species at the same level of the food
web]{.underline}. [In simple communities]{.underline}, [the effect was
even stronger]{.underline}. Sanders emphasized the **[biodiversity loss
could cause "run-away extinction cascades."]{.underline}** This research
sounds yet another dire warning bell at a time of biodiversity crisis.
Even if you don't care for poster-child species like polar bears, [the
crisis could also have ramifications for]{.underline} species that
everyone cares about, like [the [crops]{.mark} that [are the foundation
of]{.mark} our [global food supply]{.mark}]{.underline}. Studies that
show how broadly [[single extinctions]{.mark} reverberate across
ecosystems might [buoy further efforts]{.mark} to protect global
biodiversity]{.underline}.

While the **[[deep sea]{.underline}]{.mark}** was once thought to be
devoid of life --- too dark, cold and starved of food for anything to
survive --- we now know that it is **[the [largest habitable
space]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[on the planet and home to a dazzling
array of life.]{.underline}** To date, tens of thousands of species have
been found in the deep ocean, with estimates that there could be
millions more. In the Clarion-Clipperton Zone alone, a key area of
interest for deep-sea mining, researchers have recently discovered over
5,000 species that were entirely new to science. With exploration and
testing still in the early stages**[,]{.underline}** further research is
required to determine the possible ecological impacts of deep-sea
mining. **[But the science to date paints a concerning
picture.]{.underline}** **Direct harm to marine life:** There is a
**[high likelihood that less mobile]{.underline}** **[deep-sea

an important habitat for deep-sea species, **[[scientists]{.mark} are

The world is moving away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy

[electronic waste]{.mark}]{.underline} each year [than [would]{.mark}
likely be [supplied annually by]{.mark} a proposed ramp-up of deep-[sea
mining]{.mark} in the central Pacific over the next decade.]{.underline}
\[Graph Omitted\] [By building a "circular economy" for critical
minerals]{.underline} now -- one [in which products are **built
responsibly** and to last]{.underline}; fixed when they break; and
recycled into new products at the end of their lives -- [we can reduce
the pressure for all forms of mineral extraction]{.underline}, including
deep-sea mining, and lay the foundation for a sustainable energy system
for decades to come. Why is deep-sea mining so dangerous? The deep ocean
seabed is a vibrant, biodiverse place, teeming with complex ecosystems
and thousands, possibly millions of species, including deep-sea corals,
anemones, sponges and many more that scientists are only now beginning
to learn about. Deep-sea mining operations could take place over
hundreds to thousands of square miles of seafloor, harming not only the
species that live there, but broader ocean ecosystems as well. The
plumes of kicked-up sediment and discharged mining waste from deep-sea
mineral extraction could have extensive and wide-ranging impacts on
ocean ecosystems -- traveling huge distances from mining sites.
Deep-ocean ecosystems are especially vulnerable to the kind of
disruption caused by mining the seafloor. Species living in deep-sea
environments are frequently long-lived and slow to grow, and previous
deep-sea mining trials have shown that areas of seafloor disrupted by
mining are slow to recover. In some cases, damage from deep-sea mining
could be all but irreversible. We don't need deep-sea mining for the
energy transition [Deep-[sea mining]{.mark} is **[not]{.mark} a
potential source** of [all t]{.mark}he [critical minerals]{.mark}
required for the clean energy transition. Key minerals such as
[graphite]{.mark} aren't available on the seafloor]{.underline} at all,
and others -- such as [**[lithium]{.mark}** and rare earth minerals --
are available only in **[limited quantities]{.mark}** or in **specific
areas** of the ocean. [Cobalt, nickel and copper]{.mark} are among the
minerals believed to be available in the greatest [abundance in
deep-sea]{.mark} deposits. [New designs]{.mark} for electric vehicle
batteries, however, are **[reducing]{.mark} the [need]{.mark} for cobalt
and nickel**, while the amount of copper available in seafloor deposits
is just a small fraction of what is available from land-based resources.
Analysts agree that [land-based resources are sufficient]{.mark} to meet
future demand for critical minerals for the energy
transition]{.underline}. Opening up the deep ocean seafloor to
destructive mining is a choice humanity can make. But there are [other
options -- including making sure that we get everything possible out of
every pound of minerals we extract from the Earth.]{.underline} How can
the "5 Rs" help meet the critical minerals challenge? America and the
world can reduce the amount of critical minerals we need for the energy
transition -- and do so quickly -- by prioritizing the "5 Rs": the
traditional 3 Rs of reduce, reuse, recycle, plus reimagining products to
last longer and use fewer critical minerals, and repairing them when
they break. Analysts ranging from the International Energy Agency to the
Energy Transitions Commission agree that these and [other "circular
economy" strategies can significantly **reduce demand** for critical
minerals]{.underline} over the next decade and beyond. The Energy
Transitions Commission found in 2023 that circular economy strategies
[cou]{.underline}ld fully close projected supply gaps for copper and
nickel, and significantly narrow them for lithium, cobalt and neodymium
by 2030. Here are just a few of the ways that the "5 Rs" can help meet
the critical minerals challenge: The first step to solving the critical
minerals challenge: Stop throwing them away [America has a large,
homegrown source of critical minerals]{.underline} in the products we
use every day -- including electronic devices such as smartphones,
laptops, earbuds and disposable electronics such as disposable
e-cigarettes ("vapes"). Many of these electronics have short lifespans
-- from a few years for smartphones to a few days for disposable vapes.
And when they reach the end of their lives, the critical minerals in
many of those electronics wind up in our trash. America [produces
roughly 47 pounds of electronic waste per person each year]{.underline},
with more than 3 million tons of American e-waste going unrecycled
annually. [Extending the lifetimes of electronics]{.underline}, clean
energy technologies and other products throughout our economy [can
**reduce demand**]{.underline} for critical minerals at a time of
rapidly growing demand. Extending the lifetime of a product by 50% can
reduce material needs by as much as a third; doubling a product's
lifetime can reduce material needs by as much as 50%.

There's a modern-day gold rush happening in the attempt to dig
green-energy rare earth minerals out of the ground. Some believe
[[Wyoming could be America's answer to China's lock on the
market.]{.mark}]{.underline} And one of a handful of Wyoming companies
in the rush may have hit the mother lode. [[American Rare Earths
Inc]{.mark}. has its sights on thousands of acres of land near
Wheatland, Wyoming. The company disclosed in a technical report on
Wednesday that it [found 64% more r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}ineral[s than it had originally envisioned in a March
2023]{.mark} assessment]{.underline} of the land. [[**The newly
disclosed figure of 2.34 billion metric tons of rare earth**
**minerals** found southwest of Wheatland]{.underline}]{.mark} by
American Rare Earths Inc. could dwarf in size the 1.2 million metric ton
estimates in northeastern Wyoming that one of its competitors claimed
[[was one of the **biggest discoveries in the
world**.]{.underline}]{.mark} A metric ton equals about 2,200 pounds
while a ton is 2,000 pounds. "This exceeded our wildest dreams, and we
only drilled on about 25% of the property," said Donald Swartz, CEO of
American Rare Earths. The company is the U.S.-based unit of an
Australian-founded exploration company working in Wyoming. "Enormous
Potential" "These results are illustrative of the enormous potential of
the project," Swartz told Cowboy State Daily. "Typically, you'll see the
resource decrease as infill drilling takes place -- instead we're seeing
the opposite, with only 25% of the project being drilled to this point."
The rare earth minerals bonanza is the result of consumers starved for
magnet metals integral to the green transition to electric vehicles,
wind turbines, consumer goods, robots and military drones, missiles and
chips needed for sophisticated computing power. American Rare Earths
wants to mine and process these metals -- particularly neodymium and
praseodymium -- through its Wyoming Rare (USA) Inc. unit. That business
controls 367 mining claims on 6,320 acres of a mix of state, federal and
private land across the Halleck Creek Project area near Wheatland, and
four Wyoming mineral leases on 1,844 acres on the same project --- which
was renamed recently as the Cowboy State Mine, according to Swartz.

### 2nc -- Recycling Solvency

cdo

For most of the jobs rare earths do, there are no good substitutes. So
to help meet future demand and diversify who controls the supply --- and
perhaps even make rare earth recovery "greener" ---
[researchers]{.underline} are [looking for]{.underline}
**[alternatives]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[conventional]{.underline}** **[mining]{.underline}**. Proposals
include everything from extracting the metals from coal waste to really
out-there ideas like mining the moon. But [the approach most
likely]{.underline} [to make an immediate dent]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} **[recycling]{.underline}**. "Recycling is going to
play a very important and central role," says Ikenna Nlebedim, a
materials scientist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the
Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute. "That's not to say
we're going to recycle our way out of the critical materials challenge."
Still, in the rare earth magnets market, for instance, by about [10
years from now,]{.underline} **[recycling]{.underline}** [could
satisfy]{.underline} as much as [a]{.underline}
**[quarter]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [demand for
rare earths]{.underline}, based on some estimates. "**[That's
huge]{.underline}**," he says. But before the rare earths in an old
laptop can be recycled as regularly as the aluminum in an empty soda
can, there are technological, economic and logistical obstacles to
overcome. Why are rare earths so challenging to extract? Recycling seems
like an obvious way to get more rare earths. It's standard practice in
the United States and Europe to recycle from 15 to 70 percent of other
metals, such as iron, copper, aluminum, nickel and tin. Yet today, only
about 1 percent of rare earth elements in old products are recycled,
says Simon Jowitt, an economic geologist at the University of Nevada,
Las Vegas. "Copper wiring can be recycled into more copper wiring. Steel
can just be recycled into more steel," he says. But a lot of rare earth
products are "inherently not very recyclable." Rare earths are often
blended with other metals in touch screens and similar products, making
removal difficult. In some ways, recycling rare earths from tossed-out
items resembles the challenge of extracting them from ore and separating
them from each other. Traditional rare earth recycling methods also
require hazardous chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and a lot of heat,
and thus a lot of energy. On top of the environmental footprint, the
cost of recovery may not be worth the effort given the small yield of
rare earths. A hard disk drive, for instance, might contain just a few
grams; some products offer just milligrams. Chemists and materials
scientists, though, are trying to develop smarter recycling approaches.
Their techniques put microbes to work, ditch the acids of traditional
methods or attempt to bypass extraction and separation. **[Microbial
partners]{.underline}** [can help]{.underline} recycle rare earths One
approach leans on microscopic partners. Gluconobacter
[bacteria]{.underline} [naturally produce organic acids
that]{.underline} [can]{.underline} **[pull rare earths]{.underline}**,
such as lanthanum and cerium, [from]{.underline} **[spent]{.underline}**
**[catalysts]{.underline}** [used in]{.underline} **[petroleum
refining]{.underline}** [or from]{.underline} **[fluorescent
phosphors]{.underline}** used in lighting. The bacterial acids are less
environmentally harmful than hydrochloric acid or other traditional
metal-leaching acids, says Yoshiko Fujita, a biogeochemist at Idaho
National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. Fujita leads research into reuse and
recycling at the Critical Materials Institute. "They can also be
degraded naturally," she says. In experiments, the bacterial acids can
recover only about a quarter to half of the rare earths from spent
catalysts and phosphors. **[Hydrochloric acid]{.underline}** [can
do]{.underline} [much]{.underline} [better]{.underline} --- in some
cases [extracting as much as]{.underline} [**99 percent**. But bio-based
leaching might]{.underline} **[still be profitable]{.underline}**,
Fujita and colleagues reported in 2019 in ACS Sustainable Chemistry &
Engineering. In a hypothetical plant recycling 19,000 metric tons of
used catalyst a year, the team estimated annual revenues to be roughly
\$1.75 million. But feeding the bacteria that produce the acid on-site
is a big expense. In a scenario in which the bacteria are fed refined
sugar, total costs for producing the rare earths are roughly \$1.6
million a year, leaving around just \$150,000 in profits. Switching from
sugar to corn stalks, husks and other harvest leftovers, however, would
slash costs by about \$500,000, raising profits to about \$650,000.
[Other microbes]{.underline} **[can also help]{.underline}** extract
rare earths and take them even further. A few years ago, researchers
discovered that some bacteria that metabolize rare earths produce a
protein that preferentially grabs onto these metals. This
[protein,]{.underline} [**lanmodulin**,]{.underline} [can separate rare
earths]{.underline} **[from each other]{.underline}**, such as neodymium
from dysprosium --- two components of rare earth magnets. A
lanmodulin-based system might [eliminate]{.underline} [the need for the
many]{.underline} **[chemical solvents]{.underline}** typically used in
such separation. And the waste left behind --- the protein --- would be
biodegradable. But whether the system will pan out on a commercial scale
is unknown. How to pull rare earths from discarded magnets [Another
approach]{.underline} already being commercialized skips the acids and
[uses]{.underline} **[copper]{.underline}** **[salts]{.underline}** [to
pull]{.underline} [the rare earths]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
**[discarded]{.underline}** **[magnets]{.underline}**, a valuable
target. Neodymium-iron-boron [magnets are]{.underline} about **[30
percent rare earth]{.underline}** by weight and the [single]{.underline}
**[largest application]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[metals in the world]{.underline}. One projection suggests that
[recovering the neodymium in magnets from U.S. hard disk drives
alone]{.underline} [could meet]{.underline} [up about]{.underline} **[5
percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[world's
demand]{.underline}** outside of China before the end of the decade.
Nlebedim led a team that developed a technique that uses copper salts to
leach rare earths out of shredded electronic waste that contains
magnets. Dunking the e-waste in a copper salt solution at room
temperature dissolves the rare earths in the magnets. Other metals can
be scooped out for their own recycling, and the copper can be reused to
make more salt solution. Next, the rare earths are solidified and, with
the help of additional chemicals and heating, transformed into powdered
minerals called rare earth oxides. [The process]{.underline}, which has
also been used on material left over from magnet manufacturing that
typically goes to waste, [can recover]{.underline} 90 to **[98
percent]{.underline}** [of the rare earths]{.underline}, and the
material is pure enough to make new magnets, Nlebedim's team has
demonstrated. In a best-case scenario, [using this method]{.underline}
to recycle 100 tons of leftover magnet material might produce 32 tons of
rare earth oxides and [net more than]{.underline} **[\$1 million in
profits]{.underline}**, an economic analysis of the method suggests.

Most studies dealing with the recycling of REEs state the same global
situation for supply, demand, and end-of-life treatment issues in energy
sectors (energy generation, use, and conversion). [The]{.underline}
[current]{.underline} [recycling of REEs is]{.underline} **[extremely
low]{.underline}** ([only]{.underline} **[2% of REEs]{.underline}** [are
recovered by recycling processes against]{.underline}
**[90%]{.underline}** [for iron and steel]{.underline}). The

[technologies]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [well]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} [their**economic**]{.underline}
**[feasibility]{.underline}**. Moreover, [there is a real challenge for
recycling REEs because they are found at very low concentrations
in]{.underline} **[end-of-life feedstocks]{.underline}**, and [they are
located very deep in the energy-relevant equipment/gadgets and therefore
their]{.underline} **[access]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**
[complex]{.underline}. Despite the low recycling rates, [REEs
are]{.underline} **[not expected]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [be
used less]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [upcoming
years]{.underline}. On the contrary, [their]{.underline} [demand
is]{.underline} **[growing]{.underline}** [**rapidly**,]{.underline}
[and the]{.underline} **[supply will have to adapt]{.underline}**.
[Recycling]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[REEs]{.underline}** [is thus
a real topic that]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [develop more and
more]{.underline} [rapidly with encouraging projects]{.underline} [from
large recycling companies located in Asia in the]{.underline} [fields of
NiMH]{.underline} **[batteries]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[lamp
phosphors]{.underline}**, for example. Such [growth]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [often]{.underline} [driven]{.underline} [by
the]{.underline} [availability]{.underline} [of appropriate
and]{.underline} [economically viable]{.underline}
[separation]{.underline} [technologies for different]{.underline}
**[metals]{.underline}**. [Europe has a few projects as well that are
being developed that are]{.underline} **[quite promising]{.underline}**
but are not yet as large as the Asian projects. It would be beneficial
to enhance the cooperation between the different REE recycling companies
to gain more knowledge and accelerate the learning and implementation
process. [Waste]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [energy technologies
such as]{.underline} **[batteries]{.underline}**,
**[lamps]{.underline}**, **[and magnets]{.underline}** [represent a
powerful and futuristic opportunity for REE]{.underline} **[supply

u**p to]{.underline} [mining]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[satisfy]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[future]{.underline}**
[REE demand]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} [found]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [about 7% of]{.underline} [REEs]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [magnet use stocks,]{.underline} [10% in batteries,
and17% in]{.underline} [phosphor]{.underline} [lighting]{.underline}
[could be recovered through]{.underline} **[recycling]{.underline}**
**[processes]{.underline}**. The biggest potential seems thus to come
from lamp recycling, but this depends on viable separation process
developments and its economic implementation and future demands of REEs
present therein. Moreover, in Europe, 10 tons of terbium and 230 tons of
neodymium are estimated to be recoverable from waste streams every year.
Recycling of REEs should be prioritized for elements that are short in
supply (dysprosium, neodymium, europium, yttrium, and terbium).
Recycling should also be focused on the most valuable elements.
Therefore, high-purity REE separation processes have to be developed
from the complex energy system wastes. However, [it is]{.underline}
**[inevitable]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[rare earths

**[recycled]{.underline}** [in order to implement green technologies
hereby needed for the energy transition in]{.underline} **[a circular
economy]{.underline}**. Finally, it must also be noted that there are
also theoretical, technical, economical, and environmental potentials to
be elaborated on in more detail in future studies.

Prospectors contend that without deep-sea mining the world will run out
of valuable metals for green technologies. According to the World Bank,
we\'ll need more than three billion (nonmetric) tons of minerals and
metals to deploy the wind, solar and geothermal power required to avoid
two degrees C of global warming. Some estimates predict that the
reserves of cobalt, used widely in rechargeable batteries, and of
nickel, used in electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage,
in the CCZ are significantly larger than the remaining reserves on land,
although it\'s hard to gauge the real extent of resources in the abyss,
especially those that are easily recoverable. [Not everyone is convinced

ghs-\|aak\|

The [mining industry]{.underline} has identified [**[several ways to
build sustainability]{.mark}** into mining]{.underline}. **[Implementing
sustainable practices]{.underline}**: [Tailing **[reuses]{.mark}
extracted [residual metals]{.mark}** from previous mining projects,
**minimizing waste and impact**]{.underline}. Additionally, ensuring
[**[waste is managed safely]{.mark} and efficiently**]{.underline} can
prevent disasters. [**[Land rehabilitation]{.mark}** involves
**[reversing]{.mark} the [impact of mining]{.mark}** [after]{.mark} a
[project]{.mark} is complete]{.underline}, [through reforestation and
waste management]{.underline}. Working more closely with surrounding
communities can minimize the effect of mining on a community, or even
turn it into a positive. [[Shifting]{.mark} from coal power **[to
renewable energy]{.mark} sources**]{.underline}: [Taking advantage of
the very technology it's producing]{.underline}, mines that shift from
coal to renewable energy sources to power their operations can cut down
on their emissions. Chile, Mauritius and South Africa are already
leading in providing renewable power to mining sites. Globally, 1 GW of
renewables is already operational at mining sites, with another 1 GW in
development, signaling a promising shift towards cleaner energy sources.
Carbon capture: Advanced carbon capture and storage techniques could
help the mining industry to decarbonize. Some experts have suggested
that emerging technology may even be able to help miners transition to
carbon negative. Through tweaking or accelerating natural processes like
mineralization, experts have identified ways to trap or store carbon in
the mining process, neutralizing the industry's carbon footprint.
Technological innovations: [[**Technology is significantly improving**
sustainability]{.mark} in mining]{.underline}. It [improves the
transportation of minerals and metals, can reduce waste and enhances
emergency response procedures.]{.underline} Technological innovation
also directly contributes to environmental protection through waste
management, water usage, and energy usage. Moreover, techniques like
precision drilling mean mining activities are more accurately targeted.
As the demand for metals and minerals grows, their method of extraction
will play an equally important role in conservation. Supporting
sustainability in mining through policymaking, improved practices and
innovation will be a key aspect of a successful energy transition.

[[**Strategic partnerships** with **allie**]{.mark}d
nation**[s]{.mark}** [who possess **advanced**]{.mark} **maritime
[tech]{.mark}**nologies and robust frameworks for marine **resource
management** not only [provide]{.mark} the US with **access** to
**[seabed minerals]{.mark}** but also [align with **broader**]{.mark}
**geopolitical** and **economic [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By
fostering **[partner]{.mark}**ship**[s]{.mark}** with these countries,
the [**US** can leverage]{.mark} their **legal [access]{.mark}**,
technological expertise [and]{.mark} operational
**[infra]{.mark}**structure]{.underline} to jointly explore and exploit
seabed minerals. []{.mark}[This cooperation [ensures]{.mark} the [**US**
remains **competitive**]{.mark} in the **global race** for **critical
minerals**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[these]{.mark} alliances reinforce
diplomatic ties and **[enhance]{.mark} collective [security]{.mark}** as
the **strategic control** of **seabed resources** becomes increasingly
**pivotal**]{.underline} in global power dynamics. []{.mark}The future
of the US and its national interests depends on access to more than just
elements critical to the renewable energy transition. A broader array of
strategic mineral production and processing is crucial for national
defence, advanced energy and telecommunications platforms, among other
sectors. []{.mark}[The [**US** does not need]{.mark} to rely on
[China]{.mark}'s **supply chain** for **critical
minerals**]{.underline}. Long-standing Western [allies such as **Japan**
and **So**uth **Ko**rea can provide opportunities for primary
processing, granting access to high-value **commercial intermediates**
for refining]{.underline}. []{.mark}China restricts critical metal
exports following Western semiconductor curbs in latest trade war
[]{.mark}[The [chances of **Unclos**]{.mark} being ratified in the **US
Congress** [remain **slim**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Nevertheless]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the [Biden]{.mark}
administration has pledged to **[collab]{.mark}orate** [with
**allies**]{.mark} to develop agreements and encourage partner nations
to become producers of **strategic** and **critical
minerals**]{.underline} to support US supply chain needs. []{.mark}For
example, the US and Japan signed an agreement last year to strengthen
critical mineral supply chains. [**[Japan]{.mark}** has reduced its
**reliance** on **China**]{.underline} for rare earths and continues to
diversify its critical mineral sources, [drawing on its [experience
in]{.mark} **deep-sea [mining]{.mark}** research, **exploration** and
**technology development**]{.underline}. [It is now moving towards
commercial extraction of minerals in its national waters]{.underline}.
[]{.mark}The 70-year alliance between the US and South Korea presents an
opportunity for enhanced cooperation in deep-sea mining.
[**[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea has been [involved]{.mark} in
deep-sea mining [since the]{.mark} 19**[80s]{.mark}** and is **well
positioned** to support **private sector participation** in this
field]{.underline}. []{.mark}Having supported Europe's natural gas
demands following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[Norway]{.mark} is no
stranger to **operating offshore**]{.underline}. Earlier this year, [the
**country's parliament** voted to [approve]{.mark} a government proposal
to open a **[vast]{.mark} ocean [area]{.mark}** []{.mark}for
commercial-scale **deep-sea mining**]{.underline}. []{.mark}My fellow
panellists at the US-Asia Institute briefing reinforced my understanding
of Washington's pressing need to address the strategic mineral supply
chain. This urgency is highlighted in a proposed US House of
Representatives resolution calling on the ISA to adopt regulations
permitting the collection of critical minerals from the international
seabed area, which would enable the US to regain reliable and
responsible supply chains. []{.mark}Panellist Kristin Hengstebeck,
director of business development and market research for Canada's The
Metals Company, said that innovations in nodule collection technology in
the past 50 years had advanced deep ocean engineering, robotics and data
acquisition, establishing the West as a leader in innovation.
[]{.mark}The demand for critical minerals is expected to rise amid the
rapid expansion of battery-powered technology and renewable energy
systems. Estimates vary, but many forecasts suggest a substantial
increase in the need for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and
rare earth elements. For instance, the International Energy Agency
projects that demand for nickel and cobalt could grow by an order of
magnitude or more by 2040, driven largely by production of electric
vehicles. []{.mark}While it is true that all forms of mining have
effects on the ecosystem, environmental opposition to mineral extraction
often emphasises emotion rather than scientific data. [[With **science**
taking]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark}, the **[US]{.mark}** can [rely
on]{.mark} its **trusted [allies]{.mark}** [to establish]{.mark} and
implement [**responsible** and **sustainable**]{.mark} deep-sea mining
[**practices** despite]{.mark} its **current [inability]{.mark}** [to
