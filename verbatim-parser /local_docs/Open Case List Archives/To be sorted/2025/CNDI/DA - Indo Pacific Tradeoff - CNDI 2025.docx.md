In his first term, [Trump made]{.underline} some [important steps to
bring focus to the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}. His team inked
several key policy documents that put the region at the center of the
U.S. foreign policy strategy and pioneered the formal adoption of
"Indo-Pacific" as a defining narrative in U.S. foreign policy, marking a
clear strategic refinement of Obama's "Indo-Asia-Pacific." Nevertheless,
[since then, America's leverage]{.underline} in the region [has
diminished]{.underline}. The statistics back up this notion. The U.S.
remains an active player in military presence and foreign aid especially
in Southeast Asia, albeit lagging behind China in terms of investment
volume. This is evidenced by the 375 000 U.S. military troops and the
800 military bases across the area. From 2015 to 2022, the United States
gave \$9.9 billion to the region, which is a considerable amount, but
small compared to China's \$53.6 billion investment. For the same
period, the level of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) to the region
has remained low. The total FDI of the American firms in Southeast Asia
composed \$156 billion, significantly lower than China's \$218 billion.
This has given China the economic leverage Beijing requires to cement
its strategic role in the region as the economic powerhouse, entrenching
itself even tighter to other important players. As of now, [China has
emerged as the leading trading partner with most]{.underline} of the
[countries]{.underline} in the region displacing the U.S. China's Belt
and Road initiative (BRI) has invested more than \$1T in infrastructure
globally, and the Indo-Pacific is one of the key focus areas for these
investments. In an attempt to regain ground, the U.S. launched the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) in May 2022. The IPEF was
designed to increase economic cooperation and provide collaboration in
trade, supply chains and climate policy but certain financial
obligations under this umbrella were not disclosed and therefore the
effectiveness of the framework is questionable. [On the
defense-and-security front, the U.S. D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense **[has redoubled its attention to
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. [The region was described as a
"decisive year" regarding implementation of the U.S. defense plan for
2023]{.underline}. [It had included a restructuring of force posture in
the region]{.underline}, strengthening partnerships [and deploying
advanced tech]{.underline}nology to offset Beijing's expanding military
footprint. [The U.S. allocated \$886 billion]{.underline} on defense in
2024, **[with most of this funding directed towards the region's
presence]{.underline}**. [Proposals for increasing the scale of troops
stationed]{.underline} in the Philippines and Japan, [as well as for
increasing the funding of promising developments]{.underline}, such as
hypersonic missile systems, [were intended to preserve a favorable
balance of power. However, all this is achieved at a high
price]{.underline}, given the current national debt of the U.S. is more
than \$36 trillion. [Trump's "America First" approach]{.underline},
often a polarizing force in its domestic and foreign impact,
[has]{.underline} nevertheless [achieved a rare degree of bipartisan
support]{.underline} -- particularly **[when it comes to
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}** and competition with China. Trump may crow
about his "very good" phone calls with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but
[the contemporary geopolitical reality is that competition]{.underline}
-- especially with China -- [comprises the heart of modern U.S. foreign
policy, and will remain a fundamental component]{.underline} for the
foreseeable future.

#### Increased military resources in the Arctic trade off with focus on the Indo-Pacific theater

Almost weekly there is another story insinuating that the US is losing
the "race for the Arctic." [Those who support the claim that the US is
losing this race]{.underline} often highlight that the Arctic ice is
melting and that this environmental change is opening up potential trade
routes and making natural resources more ripe for exploitation. Others
then [point out that Russia has increasingly re-militarized the
Arctic]{.underline} and that China has also made inroads to establish
itself in the region. One key point these articles often make is the
United States' relative lack of icebreakers compared to its competitors.
[What is missing]{.underline} from this conversation, however, [is an
explanation of why the US has fallen behind its competitors]{.underline}
[in the Arctic]{.underline}. This article fills in that gap by
attempting to explain why the US is behaving as it does. It then argues
that paradoxically **[falling behind in this regional competition may
actually improve America's overall security and international influence
when compared to Russia and China]{.underline}**. Geography The US is
relatively fortunate in its geography. It has large coastlines with
natural harbors on both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Its rivers
largely flow southward to southern ports. It also shares borders with
Mexico and Canada, two countries that do not threaten the US in a
conventional sense. This [geography serves to protect the US from
foreign invasion and allows it to readily deploy military
forces]{.underline} to foreign locales, **[without use of the
Arctic]{.underline}**. With the advent of intercontinental missiles and
strategic bombers, the Arctic became more important to the US militarily
during the Cold War. This pushed the US to erect now largely defunct
early warning stations across northern Alaska, Greenland, and Canada.
More recently, it established incipient missile defense systems in the
Arctic to deal with increased threats emanating from Russia, China, and
North Korea and improved its ability to monitor the region. However,
these systems have never been designed to control the Arctic, but
instead to protect America, and its NATO allies, from foreign military
threats coming from, or through, the Arctic. This is an important
distinction. [Russia]{.underline} does not share America's fortunate
geographic position. Instead, it[s geographic positioning]{.underline}
and acrimonious international relationships [have pushed it to "conquer
the Arctic]{.underline}." [It has few "warm-water" ports]{.underline}
and shares large land borders with many adversarial states. Russia's
only ports that are free from year-round ice are located in Sevastopol
(Crimea), Tartus (Syria), and in the Baltic and Barents Seas.
Significantly, Russia has recently fought to maintain control over
Sevastopol and Tartus, but still faces possible blockades by adversarial
forces in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Baltic Sea. Ukraine's
attempt to join NATO, Finland's recent accession to the alliance and
Sweden's standing bid to join, along with the West's attempts to
overthrow Russia's surrogate in Syria, Bashar Assad, have heightened
Russia's longstanding fear in this regard. As a result, since the
disastrous Russo-Japanese War of 1905, and especially during WW I and WW
II,\* and the Cold War, Russia has militarized the Arctic. This is
something that it has taken up with renewed vigor under Vladimir Putin's
regime. Russia's militarization of the Arctic has especially occurred in
two spots. The first one is the ice-free Barents Sea, which Russia has
relied on to access the world's oceans so that it can better protect its
territory and international interests from foreign threats, and the
second one is under the Arctic ice cap where its nuclear submarines have
an icy bastion that protects them from NATO forces. Economics [The US
largely has a free-market economy]{.underline} with strong interest
groups that challenge its willingness to expand its commercial footprint
in the Arctic. [This has overwhelmingly kept it from attempting to
control the Arctic like Russia]{.underline} has done and China is
increasingly attempting to do. It is important to look at the times when
American commercial interests have focused on the Arctic to understand
America's overall lack of interest in this region. [The three times the
US has been economically drawn to the Arctic were to exploit temporarily
scarce resources]{.underline}. This occurred with whale oil and seal
skins during the 18th and 19th century, gold at the end of the 19th
century, and oil during the mid-twentieth century. These intense periods
of economic interest in the Arctic resulted in America's purchase of
Alaska from Russia in 1867 and the development of Alaska in the decades
afterwards. Notably, however, it is expensive and difficult to operate
in the Arctic. As Canadian Arctic expert, Michael Byers highlights, even
as the Arctic ice slowly melts, the region remains in complete darkness
for half of the year and melting ice is dangerously unpredictable. [The
Arctic is]{.underline} also austere and [quite far from the largest
population centers of the world]{.underline}. As such, the intermittent
economic demands for the region's natural resources have relatively
quickly resulted in substitutes being found for these goods in less
austere places. Subsequently, the only portions of Alaska that are
significantly developed are in the sub-Arctic portion of the state, with
the exception of the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay -- which also appear to
be winding down with the advent of fracking and renewable energy.
Increasing environmental concerns (most of Alaska is situated in
nationally owned wilderness preserves) and native groups' claims
prohibitively increase the price of resource extraction from most of
Arctic Alaska even further. Many Americans believe the region should be
left to nature and to indigenous groups. The US also does not have a
great need to develop the sea routes in the Arctic to improve its
international trade. It has a transnational road and railway system and
easy access to maritime trade routes which are connected through the
recently enlarged Suez Canal. These circumstances mean that the US has
very little motivation to establish sea routes through the largely
uninhabited, relatively shallow, and dangerously unpredictable Arctic
Ocean. Finally, Russia's aggression over the last two decades, and
increasing pressure from environmentally-based NGOs, have pushed
American-based companies even further away from Russia's Arctic. All
told, [since the US has only marginal economic incentives]{.underline}
to pursue the Arctic, [it has not felt the need to develop]{.underline}
harbors, settlements, transport [infrastructure, or
icebreakers]{.underline} to increase its footprint in the region. As
such, [it has relatively little]{.underline} capability to "conquer the
region," but also relatively little **[to defend in the
region]{.underline}**. [This is not the case for Russia or
China]{.underline}. Russia suffers from what Hill and Gaddy call the
Siberian Curse. Its geography is not as economically favorable as
America's, which has forced it to turn towards the Arctic to improve its
economic circumstances. However, it has also traditionally operated a
state-controlled economy that uses slave labor and nationally owned
corporations to mask the economic, environmental and demographic costs
of operating in the Arctic. Beginning with the czars, and accelerating
under Russia's Soviet dictators, Russia forcibly sent millions of people
to develop and "conquer the Arctic." This legacy continues today as
Putin pushes and subsidizes Russia's economic ministries and
state-controlled corporations to extract more resources from the Arctic
and to expand the infrastructure of the Northern Sea Route (with the
numerous powerful icebreakers needed to navigate this waterway) to
transport these resources to distant markets. Unlike American
corporations, Russia's economic pursuits in the Arctic are not concerned
with environmental or indigenous considerations either. Furthermore,
[Russia's extreme sacrifices in the Arctic have made]{.underline}
[developing]{.underline} and controlling [it symbolic for]{.underline}
its people and [leadership]{.underline}. As such, [Russia has much more
to defend]{.underline} materially and ideationally [in the Arctic than
the US does]{.underline}. Even with these factors pushing Russia to
conquer the Arctic, [Russia's regional ambitions have been challenged by
fiscal]{.underline}, demographic, and environmental
[hurdles]{.underline}. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has forced it
to curtail its ambitious Arctic railway and icebreaker projects and to
mobilize and sacrifice a significant proportion of its Arctic troops for
combat in Ukraine. Additionally, many of its Arctic cities have rapidly
de-populated, and the Arctic melt has paradoxically threatened its
existing Arctic infrastructure. Like Russia, China's companies are
largely nationalized and it also does not have the environmental or
indigenous concerns in the Arctic that the US does. It has spent the
last two decades increasing its manufacturing sector and its
international trade ties. This has increased its needs for natural
resources and trade routes, resulting in its plans to establish a "Polar
Silk Road," under its greater Belt and Road Initiative, in order to link
the Arctic to China's greater network of international trading posts and
manufacturing centers. As Russia has lost access to Western markets and
technology over the last two decades, it has increasingly turned towards
an eager China to help it build out its Arctic economic footprint. As
such, China also has more economic interests to defend in the Arctic
than the US does. What Does This Mean for the US? [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates is not truly interested in
competing for the Arctic. It [has]{.underline} relatively
[less]{.underline} military, economic, or ideational [interest in the
region when compared to Russia]{.underline} or China[. Its strategic
plans for the region have become increasingly assertive in reaction to
Russia's]{.underline} and China's [efforts]{.underline}, [but lack
funding or prioritization]{.underline}. However, **[this lack of genuine
interest carries some benefits for the US]{.underline}** when
considering the larger geopolitical context of the international system.
[America's lack of interest]{.underline} in the region [has]{.underline}
paradoxically [pushed the other Arctic states to increase their security
ties with the US and to take on more]{.underline} security
[responsibilities]{.underline} for the region. Similar to World War II,
when Iceland and Denmark invited the US to help protect their territory
from foreign adversaries, [Russia's aggression pushed Sweden and Finland
to formally petition to join]{.underline} the US-dominated
[NATO]{.underline}. [The inclusion of these states into the organization
means that half of the Arctic will soon be administered by
NATO]{.underline} member states. Specifically, [the Nordic
states]{.underline} of Norway, Sweden and Finland [have significant
capabilities and]{.underline} economic [stakes in the region that will
make up for America's]{.underline} relative [lack of]{.underline}
willingness and [ability]{.underline} to contain Russia's and China's
ambitions in the region. These countries' capabilities will be further
complemented by Denmark and Canada, and the other non-Arctic NATO states
that have recently increased their defense spending to deal with Russian
aggression. [This collective defense]{.underline} in the Arctic **[will
allow the US to better focus on domains like]{.underline}** space,
**[cyberspace]{.underline}**, the Americas, **[and the Indo-Pacific,
which are more important than the Arctic to America's most critical
national interests]{.underline}**. Economically speaking, the Arctic
will likely remain a backwater for market-driven economies for the
foreseeable future. The relatively high costs of extracting resources
and transporting goods from the Arctic means the region is unlikely to
become much more attractive for Western companies, even if the ice
continues to retreat (which has slowed in recent years) and icebreakers
improve, except in times when specific resources are in sharp demand or
when there are long-term bottlenecks in other trade routes. [The
resources that Russia and China extract from the Arctic will contribute
to the overall global supply of these resources and decrease their
overall price]{.underline} for American consumers. As such, [Americans
will gain many of the benefits of Russia's and China's
efforts]{.underline} in the Arctic while Russia and China absorb the
costs. In the case of scarce rare-earth minerals that have spiked in
demand and are monopolized by China, it appears Sweden may fill this
void for the US with its own Arctic resources, even as companies search
for substitutes for these critical resources. Overall, the US should not
ignore the Arctic, and it should put to rest the notion that this region
is a unique zone of peace in an otherwise quite turbulent world. That
being said, [Americans should]{.underline} also [not deem that losing
the "race for the Arctic" will critically threaten
America's]{.underline} larger national [interests]{.underline}. [By not
attempting to compete head-to-head with Russia or China to "conquer" the
region]{.underline}, [the US has incurred]{.underline} some
[advantages]{.underline} against these competitors. As the US has been
reminded again in Iraq and Afghanistan, and through its observation of
Russia's disastrous invasion of Ukraine, [conquering territory comes
with significant costs that can weaken the material
strength]{.underline} and ideational attractiveness [of a
country.]{.underline} [This]{.underline}, in turn, [weakens a country's
ability to secure its]{.underline} most significant national
[interests]{.underline}. [The US]{.underline} should continue to
diplomatically, militarily, and economically challenge Russia's and
China's actions in the Arctic on humanitarian and environmental grounds,
but it also [should identify that]{.underline} China's and [Russia's
actions in the Arctic come with high]{.underline} economic and soft
power [costs that may relatively benefit the US]{.underline}. [Doing so
will allow the US to]{.underline} increase its ability to collectively
defend its interests in the Arctic with its allies and to **[prioritize
its attention and resources on domains that are more important to it
than the Arctic.]{.underline}**

Such costs might be acceptable in exchange for peace and security. But
[spheres of influence]{.underline} during the Cold War [did not
prevent]{.underline} the Soviets from [repeatedly testing American
redlines]{.underline} in Berlin, [causing high-stakes crises in which
nuclear war was a real possibility.]{.underline} Nor did those spheres
prevent the two sides from competing sharply, and sometimes violently,
throughout the "Third World." Throughout history, [spheres-of-influence
settlements]{.underline}, from the Thirty Years' Peace between Athens
and Sparta to the Peace of Amiens between the United Kingdom and
Napoleonic France **[have often ended]{.underline}**, sooner or later,
**[in war.]{.underline}** [The idea that spheres of influence are a
formula for peace rests on assumptions that]{.underline} often [go
unexamined]{.underline}: [that revisionist powers are]{.underline}
driven primarily [by insecurity]{.underline}, that their grievances are
limited and can be easily satisfied, [that the truly vital interests of
competing powers do not conflict]{.underline}, and that creative
statecraft can therefore fashion an enduring, mutually acceptable
equilibrium. The trouble is that [these premises don't]{.underline}
always [hold]{.underline}. [Ideology and the quest for
greatness]{.underline}---not simply insecurity---[often drive great
powers]{.underline}. [Rising states are continually tempted to
renegotiate previous bargains]{.underline} once they have the power to
do so. [Offering concessions to a revisionist state may simply convince
it that the existing order is fragile]{.underline} and can be tested
further. **[Conceding a sphere of influence to a great-power challenger
might not produce stability but simply give that challenger a better
position from which to realize its ambitions]{.underline}**. Consider
the situation in the western Pacific. [The most minimal Chinese sphere
of influence would surely include Taiwan]{.underline}. [Yet if Taiwan
became a platform for Chinese military capabilities]{.underline}, [the
defense of other]{.underline} U.S. [allies]{.underline} in the region,
such as Japan and the Philippines, [would become]{.underline} vastly
more [difficult]{.underline}. [Nor would such a concession]{.underline}
likely [satisfy Chinese ambitions]{.underline}. A growing body of
literature by scholars such as Toshi Yoshihara, James Holmes, Liza
Tobin, and Elizabeth Economy suggests that [China desires]{.underline}
at the very least [to push the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
beyond the chain of islands running from Japan to Taiwan to the
Philippines. [Even a limited Chinese sphere]{.underline} in the western
Pacific **[would serve as a springboard to this larger
objective.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will have sacrificed a number of critical
advantages by pulling out]{.underline}. A free Taiwan offers proof that
Chinese culture and democracy are not incompatible; subjugating Taiwan
would also allow Beijing to remove this ideological threat. Worse still,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would lose the edge that
comes from being the only great power without significant security
hazards near its borders]{.underline}. It was only after the United
States achieved dominance in the Western Hemisphere that it could
project power globally. [Russia and China]{.underline}, by contrast[,
still have to deal with U.S.]{.underline} allies, partners, and military
[presences in their own backyards]{.underline}---**[a circumstance that
diverts resources they might otherwise use to pursue more distant
ambitions and compete with the United States at a truly global
scale.]{.underline}**

### US Committed to Indo-Pacific Now

#### US is ramping up focus on the Indo-Pacific now

In fact, as previously noted, [the stirrings of a new pivot to Asia are
detectable today]{.underline}. The [Trump]{.underline} Administration
rightly [shifted to a focus on competition with China]{.underline}, and
the [Biden]{.underline} Administration has **[intensified engagement
with the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Without referring explicitly to a
past lost decade, [policymakers have begun referring to a present
"decisive decade" in the contest with China]{.underline}. [Their steps
are,]{.underline} however, [just a start]{.underline}. Today [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs a]{.underline} new and
enveloping [Pivot to Asia]{.underline}, one [that accounts for America's
enduring global role]{.underline} and multi-region interests, draws on
lessons learned over more than a decade of effort, and is possessed by a
sense of urgency. It is time to begin doing the hardest things, to take
the actions left undone, and to align Washington's foreign policy agenda
with its national interests and stated strategic priorities.

#### Trump will focus on the Indo-Pacific containment of China through deterrence and buildup of military resources

Du **Lan in 2025**

Deputy Director at Asia-Pacific Institute, China Institute of
International Studies; Will There Be an Indo-Pacific Strategy 3.0 ?;
https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/will-there-be-an-indo-pacific-strategy-30-

[The Indo-Pacific Strategy of Trump 2.0 remains unclear ---
although]{.underline} the idea was put forward during his first term,
and **[major power competition has been a bipartisan
consensus]{.underline}**. [It will likely continue to be
pursued.]{.underline} Whether or not there will be an Indo-Pacific
Strategy 3.0 to rebuild U.S. advantages against China, serving core MAGA
goals will be both the starting point and the major goals of Trump's
Asia-Pacific policy. Since being proposed in 2017, America's
Indo-Pacific Strategy has evolved from a theoretical concept into
mechanisms in multiple areas. The main measures of the strategy during
Trump 1.0 --- which proclaimed a "free and open" Indo-Pacific ---
included diplomatically prioritizing the upgrading of such bilateral
alliances as those with Japan and South Korea, actively roping in India
and reviving the Quad and elevating it to a foreign ministers meeting.
Militarily, it implemented the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, renaming
USPACOM as USINDOPACOM, expanding "freedom of navigation" activities in
the South China Sea and incorporating Taiwan into the Security Partners
framework. Economically, it took a series of steps, together with allies
and partners (such as Japan and Australia) to support regional
infrastructure, energy security, digital economy and cybersecurity, such
as the Blue Dot Network, Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity
Partnership and the Asia EDGE Initiative. The "Indo-Pacific Strategy" of
Trump 1.0 consolidated unilateral military capabilities, but it
accomplished little for the lack of an overall economic framework.
Constant conflicts with allies arose. Overall, its achievements were
limited. During the presidency of Joe Biden, the Indo-Pacific Strategy
entered a stage of mechanism development. The Biden administration
continued Trump's strategy of competition with China, pushing forward
the Indo-Pacific Strategy to shape the strategic environment around
China. The Indo-Pacific Strategy, which was published in February 2022,
proposed five pillars: openness, connectivity, prosperity, security and
resilience; and it systematically expounded five goals and 10 action
plans. The Biden administration consolidated sci-tech and security
coordination with allies and partners through such minilateral
mechanisms as the Quad, AUKUS and the U.S.-Japan-South Korea and
U.S.-Japan-Philippines cooperation. It upgraded U.S.-ASEAN relations
into a comprehensive strategic partnership, held the U.S.-Pacific
Islands Country Summit to actively expand influence in the South Pacific
and proposed the IPEF to make up for its economic weaknesses. However,
constrained by such factors as the crises in Ukraine and the Middle
East, as well as by the conflicting interests of some allies, they
accomplished less than expected. Following Trump's return to the White
House, [the new administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy]{.underline} 3.0
[will be based on the idea of "America first"]{.underline} to project
Trump's personal policy preferences and working style, and demonstrate
more unilateralism, transactionalism and uncertainty. [First comes a
strategic]{.underline} contraction and **[resource
concentration]{.underline}**, **[evolving from global dispersion to
concentration on the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**. Judging from
policy statements by Trump himself and by core members of his
decision-making circle, [Trump will]{.underline} continue his
"neo-isolationist" tendency, reduce inputs in Europe and the Middle
East, **[concentrate resources on the Indo-Pacific and focus on dealing
with China.]{.underline}** Second is a utilitarian approach to alliances
and partnerships, orienting at "transactional alliances." While
deepening defense cooperation with allies and partners, the Trump
administration will ask Japan, South Korea and Australia to share more
defense costs and trade economic benefits for security. It will attempt
to deepen intelligence and defense cooperation with India, turn India
into a fulcrum in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy (asking India to buy
more U.S. military equipment) and open its market to U.S. agricultural
products. Third is [the pursuit of a policy of "peace through strength"
to optimize military deployments, further enhancing them in the
Indo-Pacific, including expanding America's front-line
presence]{.underline} at bases in Guam and the Philippines. [It will
deploy such offensive weapons systems]{.underline} as mid-range
missiles, [accelerate the arming of allies]{.underline} and partners
(and maritime ASEAN members) [and increase joint drills and
training]{.underline} with countries in the region. Fourth is economic
coercion, openly pursuing Trump's "America first" agenda. The strategy
may increasingly include pointing the baton of tariffs at Asia-Pacific
nations to reshape regional trade rules and promote the reshoring of
manufacturing. Japan, South Korea, India and ASEAN countries will be
asked to reduce their dependency on China. And [U.S. energy dominance
and control over supply chains will be sought.]{.underline}

#### Indo-Pacific region is the center of US strategic thinking-it's bipartisan and endures across presidents

[The focus of US strategic thinking today is on]{.underline} China and
[the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region. [This has remained so through
multiple]{.underline} presidential [administrations]{.underline} [and
several years of]{.underline} complex global [challenges]{.underline},
including the COVID-19 pandemic. While the two major political parties
are far apart on many issues, [there is remarkable bipartisan consensus
on the China challenge]{.underline}. An example is the US Innovation and
Competition Act, passed by a bipartisan 68--32 vote in the Senate in
June 2021.1 The legislation provides funds for key technological
sectors, including computer chips, where competition is fierce, seeking
to boost emerging fields and avoid Chinese dominance of key sectors. The
Interim National Security [Strategic Guidance]{.underline}, issued by
the Joseph Biden administration in March 2021, [describes China as "the
only competitor potentially capable of combining its]{.underline}
economic, diplomatic, military, and technological [power to mount a
sustained challenge]{.underline} to a stable and open international
system." Throughout the document, **[the Indo-Pacific and China are
consistently given first position as priorities for US
strategy]{.underline}**. For example, "[our presence will be most robust
in the Indo-Pacific and Europe"]{.underline} and "our vital national
interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and
the Western Hemisphere." Similarly, competition with China is discussed
extensively, in contrast to Russia, which is given relatively scant
treatment. The [Biden]{.underline} administration **[is reflecting
consensus in the US defense community]{.underline}**. The 2018 National
Defense Strategy similarly identified China as the primary US problem
and the Indo-Pacific as the priority region.2 The 2021 Annual Threat
Assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
describes "China's push for global power."3 **[Assessments from academia
and the think-tank community are part of this broad
consensus]{.underline}**, although there are degrees of difference.4

Indo-Pacific region [has become]{.underline} increasingly
[fierce]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline} the strategic
competition [between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. If China and the United States cooperate,
stability can be maintained in the region; if China and the United
States are in conflict, a series of international contradictions will be
aggravated.20 [Since Trump took office,]{.underline} [the U.S.
strategy]{.underline} toward China has [been characterized
by]{.underline} comprehensive "[containment]{.underline}," vicious
competition, and systematic confrontation. In the 2017 National Security
Strategy of the United States of America and the 2020 United States
Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China, the U.S. defined
China as its foremost competitor and greatest challenge. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration **[regarded the Indo-Pacific as the
core arena of the U.S.-China strategic game]{.underline}**. The first
substantial move to this end was the official renaming of the Pacific
Command the "Indo-Pacific Command" on May 30, 2018. In the 2019
Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released by the Trump administration,
[China was described as "a revisionist power]{.underline}." The report
pointed out that, "as [China]{.underline} continues its economic and
military ascendance, it [seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the
near-term and, ultimately, global preeminence]{.underline} in the
long-term." In response, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[must "preserve peace through strength by rebuilding our
military]{.underline} so that it remains preeminent, and rely on allies
and partners to shoulder a fair share of the burden of responsibility to
protect against common threats."21 The [Biden]{.underline}
administration [inherited the Trump administration's
strategy]{.underline} toward China. [The]{.underline} 2022 National
Security [Strategy of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[begins by stating that]{.underline} "the post-Cold War era is
definitively over and [a competition is underway]{.underline} between
the major powers [to shape what comes next." The strategy defines China
as "the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the
international order]{.underline} and, increasingly, the economic,
diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that
objective."22 The word "outcompete" appears ten times in this strategy,
while "outcompete China" appears four times. Mike Johnson, Speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives, publicly declared that "communist
China is America's largest geopolitical foe" and "enemy."23 [With the
unfolding of the strategic competition between China and the United
States, the order in the Indo-Pacific region will inevitably
undergo]{.underline} division, [reorganization]{.underline}, and
reconstruction.

#### US economic and military policy still focused on Indo-Pacific containment of China

through 2030: Continuity, Consequences, and Change; 38 North;
https://www.38north.org/2024/10/us-policy-toward-the-indo-pacific-through-2030-continuity-consequences-and-change/

As viewed from Washington, [the Indo-Pacific problem is mainly driven by
Sino-American competition.]{.underline} The [Trump and
Biden]{.underline} administrations [both described the China challenge
in similar terms]{.underline} [and amplified policies aimed at
strengthening the US hand in that competition]{.underline}. The Trump
administration's "Free and Open" Indo-Pacific framework and the Biden
administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy speak of China as the principal
destabilizing agent whose perceived revisionist aims threaten US
interests in the region. Influenced by what they assess as the return of
great power competition, both administrations' National Security
Strategy (NSS) documents elaborated on the need to contain China and
build a "balance of influence" favorable to the United States.
Importantly, four areas of continuity can be observed across the two
administrations' strategies toward the region---trends that seem likely
to sustain in a second Trump or Harris administration. [The first policy
continuity is countering the perceived regional military threat from
China, especially toward Taiwan.]{.underline} When he took office in
2017, Donald Trump vowed to preserve US military superiority in Asia.
His National Security Strategy (NSS) argued that American "advantages
are shrinking as rival states modernize and augment their nuclear and
conventional forces," and---believing that military superiority is
predicated on the ability to prevail in areas where the US is weakest
relative to its adversary---placed a premium on denying Chinese military
superiority around Taiwan. One presidential administration later, Joe
Biden's NSS strikes a similar tone, reaffirming the US would maintain
its "capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan,"
and adds in his National Defense Strategy (NDS) that the Defense
Department's first priority would be to develop
anti-access/area-denial-insensitive strike capabilities. While traveling
to Japan in 2022 to meet with Japanese, South Korean, and Australian
leaders, Vice President Harris similarly noted that "peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait is an essential feature of a free and open
Indo-Pacific" and that the US "will continue to deepen our unofficial
ties" with Taipei and "will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense,
consistent with our longstanding policy." [Both the Trump and Biden
administrations emphasized the need to strengthen deterrence against
China]{.underline} and North Korea [by conducting military deployments,
nuclear-capable bomber overflights, and joint exercises with allies. A
second area of continuity has been the further strengthening of
alliances]{.underline}. Sustaining [a reliable alliance system has been
a cornerstone of the US approach]{.underline} to the region for over
seventy years. In their strategy documents, both the Trump and Biden
administrations emphasized the importance of existing security alliances
and expanded partnerships via the Quad and related frameworks.
Admittedly, during his presidency, Trump was rhetorically more hostile
toward the alliances with Japan and South Korea in particular, yet, like
his successor, he underwrote actions to sustain those alliances and
forge new regional partnerships in the face of mounting Chinese and
North Korean pressures. The Biden Administration adopted and drove the
Indo-Pacific Strategy further, complemented by strategic asset rotations
to the Korean Peninsula and closer trilateral defense and deterrence
cooperation with Japan and South Korea. A third area of continuity,
underscored by similar language in both administrations' national
security documents, has been the commitment to denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula. Every president since Bill Clinton has, with varying
degrees of effort, sought to negotiate constraints on North Korea's
nuclear activities, all under the rubric of denuclearization. The
promise of inducements resulting from negotiations has been backed by
"maximum pressure" campaigns to convince North Korean leaders to abandon
their nuclear ambitions, a policy that continues under Biden and seems
likely also to be a feature of a putative Harris administration's future
policy toward the Korean Peninsula. Trump departed from this strategy in
form by holding summits and exchanging letters with Kim Jong Un, but not
in substance. Finally, [one additional area of continuity between Trump
and Biden]{.underline} that does not have the same lineage yet is an
increasingly prominent element of US strategy toward the region, [is a
sharp shift away from Sino-American economic
interdependence.]{.underline} The turn toward economic protectionism
predated [Trump]{.underline}, but he [accelerated]{.underline} it [by
implementing steep tariffs]{.underline} on steel and aluminum, which
were rapidly followed by additional tariffs on \$50 billion worth of
Chinese imports. [The ensuing trade war set-off a process of partial
economic de-coupling]{.underline} -- or "de-risking" as the Biden
administration has termed it. China-US trade fell by 14.5% between 2022
and the first half of 2023. Like Trump, [Biden's strategy documents all
point to Chinese economic coercion and weaponization of
interconnectivity as reasons for the US to strengthen its economic
competitiveness and impose costs via tariffs]{.underline}, sanctions,
and export controls. Harris has few antecedents on trade policy, but in
her presidential debate with Trump in September 2024, she charged that
Trump "sold us out on China" by "selling American chips to China to help
them improve and modernize their military," and advocated for targeted
restrictions, particularly on AI and quantum computing, coordinated with
US allies.

### At: Squo Fails- Indo-Pacific

#### US focus on Indo-Pacific solves now- contains China and aligns objectives

Since the announcement by [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
of its Indo-Pacific vision in 2017 and the release of its [Indo-Pacific
Strategy]{.underline} in 2018 --- as well as its implementation of
military, political, economic, diplomatic, and technological policies
--- the U.S. strategy [has made significant progress at]{.underline} the
cognitive, [policy and strategic levels.]{.underline} First,
[the]{.underline} Indo-Pacific [Strategy has]{.underline} not only
[raised Americans' awareness]{.underline} of the importance of the
Indo-Pacific region [but has also gained]{.underline} attention and
[policy follow-ups from other major countries]{.underline} or groups of
countries to that region. The U.S. strategic community's [awareness of
the importance of the]{.underline} Indo-Pacific [region has increased
significantly]{.underline}, and the Republican and Democratic parties
have found a high degree of agreement. [This strengthens
the]{.underline} will and [determination of the U.S. to promote the
strategy]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [helps maintain its
stability]{.underline} and continuity. In addition, the strategy has
effectively focused the international community's attention on the
region. The United States is not the first country to use the
Indo-Pacific concept, nor is it the first to focus on the region at the
policy level, but the promotion of the Indo-Pacific concept at the
international level and the widespread attention of the international
community to the region are directly related to the high-profile
proposal of the United States. [With]{.underline} the gradual
clarification and steady [progress of the Indo-Pacific
Strategy]{.underline}, countries or [regional organizations have put
forward their own strategies]{.underline} or ideas. By contrast, the
attention of non-Indo-Pacific countries is even greater and more
high-profile at the policy level. France, Germany, the European Union
and Canada have all introduced their own Indo-Pacific strategies. As a
result, the region is not only the direction toward which the U.S.
strategic focus has shifted but has even become the center --- where the
world's major strategic thinking is directed. The attention of countries
or groups of countries inside and outside the region have, to a certain
extent, coordinated with or responded to the United States as it
implements its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Second, [the overall policy
structure of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy has]{.underline} been formed
and has [been continuously]{.underline} enriched and
[improved]{.underline}. This is mainly reflected in the fact that [the
strategy has clear]{.underline} strategic [objectives]{.underline},
clear strategic [targets]{.underline} [and a]{.underline} relatively
**[balanced policy system]{.underline}**. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration basically [built a whole-of-government]{.underline},
whole-of-society, whole-of-field [policy framework]{.underline} for it.
The Biden administration has absorbed this policy framework in its
entirety and further improved it, most notably in terms of systemic and
balanced policies. From a policy perspective, while maintaining
strategic investment and high-profile involvement in the security
aspects of the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. has paid more attention to
policy design and implementation in other areas. In particular, it
launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and built an
economic platform to promote its strategy. From the perspective of
topics, the U.S. has not only strengthened its focus on traditional
security areas but also incorporated non-traditional security topics
into the Indo-Pacific Strategy, such as climate change, disaster relief
and epidemic prevention and control, in response to the concerns of some
regional countries to a certain extent. From the perspective of
governing philosophy, the Biden administration has revised the Trump
administration's "America first" principle, revived traditional
multilateralism, and repaired and developed alliances and partnerships
--- such as upgrading the U.S.-Japan-India-Australia Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue and building the AUKUS trilateral security partnership
between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States --- to
revive U.S. dominance in international organizations and multilateral
platforms. Third, [the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy poses a greater
challenge to China]{.underline}. The U.S. defines China as a strategic
competitor that poses an all-encompassing challenge to it. The U.S.
Department of Defense calls China a pacing challenge. This means that
[relative gains have become a primary consideration in U.S. policy
toward China]{.underline}, with the result that the United States is
less likely to cooperate and is more inclined to delay and curb China's
development. In this context[, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy puts
direct pressure on China]{.underline} by gaining geographical proximity,
[and it exerts indirect pressure on China's development]{.underline} [by
shaping the regional environment]{.underline}, with the ultimate goal,
obviously, of serving its grand strategy of outcompeting China --- in
short, to "win." [There is no doubt that the Indo-Pacific Strategy has
exerted considerable pressure on China's sovereignty and security
interests]{.underline} (the Taiwan question is the most concentrated and
obvious manifestation), [bringing more]{.underline} complexity and
[uncertainty to China's development environment]{.underline} **[and
forcing China to focus more energy and resources on the]{.underline}**
Asia-Pacific [**region**. This will]{.underline}, to a certain extent,
**[alleviate the competitive pressure that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[faces from China at the global
level]{.underline}**. From the perspective of China-U.S. strategic
competition, **[the Indo-Pacific Strategy has to some extent served as a
counterweight to China's development strategy and
process]{.underline}**.

### Generic- Defer to Indo-Pacific

#### Increased militarization in any region forces tradeoffs- defer to the Indo-Pacific- it's more important for countering China and preserving heg

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates is and [should remain a
global power]{.underline}, [and so a renewed pivot to Asia must
account]{.underline} **[for attention and resources devoted to other
regions]{.underline}** and issues. In identifying resources that might
be drawn on, policymakers should be able to demonstrate that **[the
benefits of doing more in the Indo-Pacific outweigh the likely costs of
doing less elsewhere]{.underline}**. [And when the calculation suggests
that a shift in priorities is warranted, such a decision should be
discussed thoroughly with allies and partners]{.underline} and made with
as much specificity as possible---based on a particular set of policy
tools or military deployments---rather than on the abstract basis that
simply doing more is better. Pivoting to Asia cannot mean the
abandonment of key commitments elsewhere. Americans, after all, care not
only about forestalling Chinese hegemony in Asia, but also about
preventing terrorist attacks originating in the Middle East or
Afghanistan, punishing and helping reverse Russian aggression in Europe,
deterring Iranian malfeasance, ensuring Israel's defense, securing
energy supplies and sea lanes, combating climate change and dangers to
public health, and helping developing nations improve their quality of
life. America's ability to sustain focus on the long-term challenge of
China depends on the lack of acute, threatening crises in Europe and the
Middle East. By pulling troops completely from Iraq in 2011, for
instance, the Obama Administration did not redeploy them to Asia but
instead ensured America's return. The same sadly may be the case in
Afghanistan. Sustaining a low level of U.S. military presence,
diplomatic engagement, or funding in key non-Asia areas could aid,
rather than undermine, Washington's pivot to Asia. America should tilt
toward the Indo-Pacific, but not so far that it topples over. Calculate
Trade-Offs amid Great Power Competition [Pivoting to Asia in a world of
scarce resources entails trade-offs]{.underline}, and yet as every
policy practitioner knows, setting priorities is far easier said than
done. Assessed individually, [every region]{.underline}---the Western
Hemisphere, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Global South---[has a
claim to priority]{.underline}, and many issues have constituencies
inside or outside government that argue for their importance. [Making
choices is harder still when the United States faces]{.underline}
great-power [competitors]{.underline} [in]{.underline} both [China and
Russia]{.underline}, simultaneously and indefinitely. Both countries are
globally active, and **[an approach that attempts to resist their
influence everywhere would be unsuccessful]{.underline}**. Even a
generalized Asia-first approach represents an insufficient guide to
policy and resources; after all, the Indo-Pacific is a big place.
Actions by China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, or international terrorist
groups that would undermine U.S. vital national interests, contest key
principles of international order, constrict the United States' freedom
to act, or undermine the domestic functioning of U.S. allies and key
partners should broadly define America's national security priorities.
[Policymakers should]{.underline} thus [focus]{.underline} most [on
actions]{.underline} in the places and [on]{.underline} the [issues
where the potential damage to key]{.underline} U.S. national [interests
is large]{.underline} and the potential utility to the challenger is
significant. [The remainder]{.underline} of adversaries' activities
around the world that are undesirable, offensive, and even contrary to
lesser interests [should be]{.underline} relegated to a
[lower]{.underline} tier of [priority]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
challenges **[should receive a significantly smaller share of
American]{.underline}** national security **[resources]{.underline}**
and attention. As Steve Jobs observed, "People think focus means saying
yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at
all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are."
Washington therefore needs a far subtler prioritization of regions and
issues, and a policy process that considers the relative importance of
multiple crises and opportunities rather than evaluating each on its
own. This is true not only for the executive branch but also for
Congress, which tends to focus on headline issues and direct funding and
policy changes accordingly. The policy prescriptions in the "to-do list"
below translates imperatives to set priorities and make trade-offs into
a series of concrete actions. [The alternative]{.underline}, in this new
era, [would require the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
resist]{.underline} undesirable [Chinese (and Russian) influence
wherever it exists]{.underline}---which is to say, every region of the
world and across a wide spectrum of issues. [To attempt
this]{.underline}, even while working with allies and partners and
taking every other prudent step to augment American power, **[ensures
failure]{.underline}**. The United States should do more but not try to
do it all, everywhere. A U.S. approach to China that seeks only a pivot
to Asia is incomplete, but [a strategy that does not pivot to Asia will
fail.]{.underline}

### Budget/Public Perception

#### Budget constraints prevent boosting hegemony in every region- public perception makes tradeoffs inevitable

https://www.stimson.org/2024/rethink-us-grand-strategy/

For one thing, primacy fails to account for the many constraints ---
both internal and external --- on America's ability to shape the world
through military power. The [fiscal and budgetary constraints
are]{.underline} particularly [acute]{.underline}. In 2024, [interest
payments on the national debt exceeded the Pentagon's
budget]{.underline} --- which is also near record highs in absolute
terms. Since 2000, [U.S. military spending has risen by nearly 50
percent]{.underline}, after adjusting for inflation, [and yet even these
increases fall far short of what is required to fund a military that is
supposed to stop every threat, **in every part of the
world**]{.underline}, all the time. Though it acknowledges that military
spending has grown in recent years, the NDS Commission concludes that
[such increases have failed to keep pace with an ever-expanding set of
missions. The Commission calls for spending far more]{.underline}, and
argues that "increased security spending should be accompanied by
additional taxes and reforms to entitlement spending." The commissioners
are careful not to say how much Pentagon spending must rise to meet the
mission, but my Stimson colleague Julia Gledhill and I have estimated
the cost at between \$5 and \$10 trillion in additional spending over
the next decade, on top of the more than \$9.3 trillion that U.S.
taxpayers are already projected to spend on the military. At the end of
that period, annual Pentagon budgets could approach \$3 trillion. Such
[figures are absurdly out of touch with the priorities of the American
people]{.underline}. [While the U.S. economy is large enough to sustain
very high levels of military spending]{.underline} --- and has done so
---[Americans want more of their tax dollars spent on things that
improve their lives]{.underline}, including adequate housing, quality
and affordable health care, and accessible education. Meanwhile, older
Americans, even those who are relatively affluent, expect politicians to
protect Social Security and Medicare --- one of the rare instances where
both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris found agreement. Though some
Americans see defense industries as key to the revival of domestic
manufacturing, military spending is notoriously inefficient, and more of
it will do very little to enhance America's long-term economic
competitiveness. So, it is hardly wise to continue to base U.S. grand
strategy on an ever-expanding Pentagon budget. As former Trump National
Security Advisor Robert O'Brien wrote earlier this year, "large
increases to defense expenditures are unlikely regardless of which party
controls the White House and Congress. Spending smarter will have to
substitute for spending more." Meanwhile, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is overextended]{.underline}. In the Middle East,
the U.S. military has spent more than \$4.8 billion striking Houthis in
Yemen, while U.S. weapons deliveries to Israel have fueled a widening
conflict. U.S. military personnel manning Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) missile defense systems in Israel could easily be caught
in the crossfire. U.S. forces at vulnerable bases in Syria and Iraq have
regularly been targeted by Iran-backed militias since the Gaza War
began. And, in Ukraine, where the United States has already delivered
over \$100 billion in aid, U.S. weapons have failed to tip the scales
decisively in Kyiv's favor. **[The trade-offs are
obvious]{.underline}**: [at a time when most strategists call for
focusing on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, money, materiel, and [too
much time and attention have been spent elsewhere]{.underline}.

### Icebreakers

#### Significant military icebreaker development and navigation of the Arctic diverts resources from focusing on countering China in more important regions

graduated from Lewis & Clark College and holds a B.A. in international
affairs and German studies; Why we should put a freeze on Arctic
militarization; Responsible Statecraft;
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/08/30/why-we-should-put-a-freeze-on-arctic-militarization/>

The U.S. military has certainly taken notice as it has quietly
dispatched flotillas of destroyers to the area, and the Air Force has
decreed that by 2022, more advanced fighter aircraft will be based in
Alaska than any other place on the planet. Such actions are lauded by
many [theorists]{.underline}, who [argue that the United States must
fortify its northernmost reaches]{.underline}, given the growing value
of the American Arctic and the enhanced military presence of Russia and
China. Nevertheless, [Washington must avoid such substantial
militaristic measures, since they are unnecessary and **misallocate
significant funds and resources that could be better used elsewhere.**
The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has far fewer motives to
militarize the Arctic than any other Arctic state]{.underline}. Despite
its enormous size and resource-rich reputation, Alaska is only the
country's 6th largest oil-producing state, with the nation's
11th-largest proven natural gas deposits and 1 percent of America's
coal. And although there are massive untapped hydrocarbon deposits off
the state's coast, [the utility of extracting these resources is
questionable given the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
already a net exporter of energy]{.underline}, most of these deposits
lie in protected areas, and natural resource rents (of all types)
compose a paltry 0.6 percent of the country's GDP. Resource protection
is not the only argument analysts make for deploying the military
northwards. Many view the Northwest Passage that borders Alaska as a
trade route of increasing importance that warrants substantially
increased fortification. However, [there is limited utility in deploying
military units]{.underline} on its behalf[. The route is handicapped by
stubborn sea ice deposits]{.underline}, the [inconvenient
paths]{.underline} that shipping must use, and a critical shortage of
supporting infrastructure; [not to mention that Canada claims most of
the route]{.underline} as its sovereign territory (and holds more
influence over it, regardless of the validity of its assertion). Even if
these pitfalls are addressed, [it is unclear how a bolstered military
presence could help facilitate northerly trade. America's territorial
disputes also don't warrant military action:]{.underline} the
sovereignty dispute over the Northwest Passage with Canada is far from
hostile. There are growing incentives for both parties to resolve the
dispute and some proposed solutions present opportunities for mutual
gain and cooperation. Similarly, the territorial dispute in the Beaufort
Sea concerns an area smaller than New Hampshire with dubious economic
potential, and both nations' proposed settlements grant each other
sizable territorial gains. Additionally, [military deployments would do
little to help resolve territorial disputes]{.underline}, given Canada
is a close American ally. There is also the question of U.S. national
security priorities. **[Why should Washington spend exorbitant sums
fortifying the Arctic with specialized, expensive equipment when it has
more pressing concerns in other regions?]{.underline}** **[Arctic bases
are expensive]{.underline}** **[and painstaking to build and
operate]{.underline}**, a problem that climate change will exacerbate.
[The next generation of icebreakers cost between \$700 million and \$1
billion each]{.underline}, [and they aren't]{.underline} exactly
[designed to conduct freedom of navigation exercises in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. This isn't to
say that the country should avoid building any icebreakers, but
**[policymakers must budget defense spending with a clear understanding
of its national security priorities in mind.]{.underline}** Still,
perhaps the most prevalent justification to bolster the U.S. military
presence in the Arctic is to counter Russia's military buildup there.
However, [Russia's militarization of the region has little to do with
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its national security
ambitions]{.underline}; [there is simply more at stake for Russia's own
economy. Russia's Arctic coastline is 15 times longer]{.underline} than
the U.S. equivalent. Its Arctic territory contains 48 billion barrels of
oil and 43 trillion square meters of natural gas, resources which the
Russian government and economy are highly dependent on (resource rents
comprise more than 13 percent of its GDP). Additionally, Russia has
deployed military and government units to bolster its claim to the
Lomonosov Ridge region, a valuable and sizable area in the central
Arctic; and recognizes the growing viability of the Northern Sea Route,
which is now navigable by merchant ships as early as February. The
passage, which connects East Asia with Europe over the Russian coast,
promises to expedite intercontinental trade, and Moscow seeks to enforce
full sovereign control over this route. [Russia has a plethora of
compelling reasons to fortify the Arctic, least of which is to threaten
America's national security]{.underline}. So why should scores of F-22s
and F-35s stand by in Alaska, awaiting an invasion that will never come?

### Regional Priorities

#### New regional military priorities force tradeoffs that put the Indo-Pacific at risk- US must commit high level resources to maintain effective presence

[The size of the Indo-Pacific region, and its distance from]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} continental [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
**[raises the costs of a US rebalance]{.underline}**. **[These costs are
compounded by the high-end nature of military competition in the
region,]{.underline}** as well as new generations of technology. In
2020, USINDOPACOM released an investment plan, titled "Regain the
Advantage," that laid out resourcing requirements for "establishing the
necessary linkages between the strategy, required capacity,
capabilities, and budgetary priorities."16 The plan called for more than
\$20 billion over six years.17 The plan noted that "USINDOPACOM's force
design and posture must enable the convergence of capabilities from
multiple domains and create the virtues of mass without the
vulnerability of concentration,"18 implicitly acknowledging the threat
posed by Chinese strike capabilities in theater. It went on to state
that "this requires a force posture and joint force laydown west of the
International Date Line . . . properly positioned to defend in depth,
while possessing the capabilities and authorities to respond to
contingencies across the region."19 While USINDOPACOM is expected to
advocate for additional resources, it has found a receptive audience in
Congress. Congress established the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI)
in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to improve the posture
and readiness of US forces in the region, devoting \$6.9 billion over
two years.20 Much like the 2021 Innovation and Competition Act, the PDI
reflects bipartisan consensus on the challenge posed by China and the
need for extra resourcing to meet that challenge. The bipartisan
consensus on shoring up the US position in the Indo-Pacific was
underscored in July 2021, when Kurt Campbell, the Biden administration's
Indo-Pacific coordinator, gave remarks in which he stated bluntly: "I
think we recognize that the United States has a lot of work to do. . . .
We have historically a strong position in Asia. That position has
slipped and we are at risk, and we need to make substantial investments
across the board."21 [Much analysis has focused on needed improvements
to US force posture in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, and many proposals
are under discussion.22 The PDI itself, as well as the DOD's spending
plan, have all received critiques. Nevertheless, [the]{.underline}
roiling [discussion makes clear that]{.underline} current US posture is
not considered adequate, that [major new spending is politically
feasible]{.underline}, and that there are no simple solutions. In this
context, [it is hard to imagine significant resources becoming available
to other geographic regions such as the Arctic]{.underline}. [Congress
is facing a strong demand signal in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, [and
there appears to be enough bipartisan consensus to appropriate
funds]{.underline} to meet this priority. However, **[the larger federal
budget is under significant strain]{.underline}** from ongoing
pandemic-related displacement, and a divided Congress has slowed the
legislative process.

### Resources

#### Maintaining Indo-Pacific investment requires tradeoffs- resources only stretch so far

Let us begin with how to reduce risk. [Preventing the use of
force]{.underline} and giving our partners the security space to resist
Chinese coercion **[requires U.S. military might]{.underline}**.
[And]{.underline} it requires [that]{.underline} **[more of it be
concentrated in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Other presenters at
this conference are focusing on defense budgeting and strategy, so I
will not offer an extended discussion here. But it suffices to say that
[U.S. policymakers must seriously look at new investments]{.underline}
in strategic nuclear forces, intermediate-range missiles, our naval
fleet, [and]{.underline} certain [capabilities]{.underline} [tuned to
turning back an invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}. [I name these items
specifically to balance corresponding investments China is
making]{.underline}---investments that are beginning to tip the security
equilibrium of the region. [Making these investments would present
**difficult** budgeting **questions** **and** **weighty tradeoffs in
U.S. global military presence**]{.underline}. However, current events
may offer a path forward. Many in the foreign policy community lament
Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an unfortunate diversion of U.S.
attention from the Indo-Pacific, even if it is a necessary focus for the
United States. There is truth to that, at least in the short term.
However, [in the medium and long term, the Ukraine war outlines an
opportunity to responsibly shift U.S. military resources
eastward]{.underline}.

The Arctic becoming a strategic battleground was explicitly acknowledged
in June 2024 through the U.S. Department of Defense's Arctic Strategy,
noting growing Russian-Chinese collaboration. Despite major combat
losses in Ukraine, [Russia continues to expand its Arctic military
presence]{.underline} and activities. [The Arctic's unique environment
requires specialized training and equipment, posing challenges for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[in projecting and sustaining
military forces in the region]{.underline}**. **[This task is further
complicated by the American strategic focus on countering China in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. [**NATO represents an ideal form of Arctic
burden-sharing, allowing the United States to concentrate elsewhere.**
As the Trump administration pivots back to Asia, maintaining strong NATO
ties is crucial]{.underline}, despite rhetoric to the contrary. NATO has
been tying its strategic survival to an Indo-Pacific pivot since 2019,
and the [Trump]{.underline} administration [will need to rely more on
Arctic-minded NATO allies to deter Russian and Chinese
ambitions]{.underline}. **[The U.S. military has minimal forces capable
of operating in the Arctic]{.underline}** but also needs to defend its
space-based infrastructure around the region. [By leveraging
NATO]{.underline}, particularly the Arctic expertise of British,
Canadian, and Nordic allies, **[the United States can ensure a stable
Arctic presence, enabling a robust military posture in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}**

## China Impact

### Indo-Pacific Key- China

#### Indo-Pacific key to global stability and now is key- collapse leads to Chinese dominance

Alex **Wong in 2023**

principal deputy national security advisor. He was a senior fellow at
Hudson Institute; Balance in the Indo-Pacific: Defining the US Approach;
The Hudson Institute;
https://www.hudson.org/defense-strategy/balance-indo-pacific-defining-us-approach-alex-wong

In brief, it is because [the Indo-Pacific is the most important region
for the prosperity of the American people now and]{.underline} into
[the]{.underline} foreseeable [future]{.underline}, [and it is also the
region whose potential for conflict poses the greatest risk]{.underline}
both to our security and [to the stability of world order]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} high-reward/high-risk [status]{.underline} [arises
from the current]{.underline} and peculiar [stage of the Indo-Pacific's
development as a coherent region]{.underline}. On one hand, [it is the
world\'s largest economic region]{.underline}, one that is thoroughly
interconnected and whose geography has allowed it to reap the benefits
of maritime trade, the advent of global supply chains, and the
innovation that arises from progressively freer-thinking societies. With
the ongoing signings of various trade and investment pacts, the region
is becoming even more closely integrated economically, fueling its
growth. On the other hand, [the Indo-Pacific has relatively
underdeveloped regional political and security
architectures]{.underline}. And the ones that do exist are not yet tuned
to managing a China that is increasingly powerful, ambitious, and
aggressive. [The lack of mature political and security architectures is
a risk factor]{.underline} in the same way that failing to build a beach
house up to code is a risk factor. [On its own, it will not cause the
house to collapse]{.underline}; it is the hurricane that rolls in that
will. In the case of the Indo-Pacific, [the coming hurricane is China's
strategic ambition.]{.underline} It is no secret that [China's chief
strategic objective is to restore Beijing's political
centrality]{.underline} in the region. In China's nationalist and
mercantilist vision, [that means shutting the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates (as well as European partners and India) [out of
the region]{.underline}---an "Asia for Asians," as Xi Jinping has taken
to say. [China aims to compromise the vectors of U.S.
influence]{.underline}---[military]{.underline} might and access,
[economic]{.underline} ties, [technological]{.underline} reach, [and
political]{.underline} weight---so as [to secure Beijing's]{.underline}
unquestioned [dominance]{.underline} of the region. And if
[China]{.underline} has [global ambitions]{.underline}, that larger
project [will start with]{.underline} and be contingent on Chinese
[domination of the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [This region]{.underline},
therefore, [constitutes]{.underline} both [the opening round of our
competition and]{.underline} **[the most pivotal]{.underline}** one.

### China Revisionism !- War

#### [Chinese-led order]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline}

International Affairs, Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania; The
Cipher Brief, "The China Order: A Challenge for the U.S. and the World,"
<https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-china-order-a-challenge-for-the-u-s-and-the-world>\]

It is no longer hard to see that [the **rising power**]{.underline} and
the mounting pugnaciousness [of [the **P**]{.mark}]{.underline}eople's
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**epublic of **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
(PRC) [have become a]{.underline} comprehensive [**[challenge]{.mark}**
for the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [China's **Machiavellian
policies**]{.underline} and actions [at home and abroad have turned
a]{.underline}n otherwise naturally complementary
[Sino-American]{.underline} economic [relationship into a]{.underline}
near **[zero-sum]{.underline}**, if not already a zero-sum, [competition
for]{.underline} market, jobs, technology, and financial
[**[primacy]{.mark}**. Beijing]{.underline} now [openly **flexes
its**]{.underline} new [**muscles** in its neighborhood]{.underline} and
beyond [[to]{.mark} resist]{.underline}, reduce, [and
**[replace]{.mark}** American **leadership**]{.underline} and presence
[everywhere possible, seeking to **undermine** [the]{.mark} U.S.-led
**[international]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic [[**order** and]{.mark}
American-anchored **collective [security]{.mark}**
arrangements]{.underline}. The PRC has been burning billions, for
example, hoping to replace the U.S. dollar with the over-printed Chinese
Renminbi (RMB). Extraordinarily heavy extraction of its own economy, the
world's second largest, and its enormous foreign currency reserve
resulting from the gross imbalance in U.S.-China trade have enabled the
PRC to massively expand its military. That military is already the
world's second largest; its navy, for example, is projected to soon
surpass the U.S. Navy in fleet tonnage. At the same time, massive but
opaque spending sprees has allowed the PRC to actively procure power and
proxies even inside the United States, positioning Beijing to reshape
international opinions and norms more easily than ever. What is less
known, perhaps, is that [the **rising [PRC]{.mark}**]{.underline} state
also [[seeks an **overhaul** of]{.mark} the **very world order**
that]{.underline} has [enabled the **greatest advances** of human
civilization]{.underline} over the past few centuries -- [the
Westphalian system of **[nation-states]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
world order was codified in the 17th century, expanded to a global scale
in the 20th century, and now is in its post-World War II and post-Cold
War iteration --- [the so-called **America-led L**]{.underline}iberal
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[O]{.underline}**rder (LIO). [The rise
of Chinese power, under the **autocracy** of the
**C**]{.underline}hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty (CCP), [is not just contesting]{.underline} U.S.
national security and [American global leadership but]{.underline} also
[the **existing world order**. Never since the heyday of the Cold War
has the world seen such a **full challenge** to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} to
[the Westphalian system]{.underline}. [The CCP is leading]{.underline}
the PRC [toward]{.underline} a Chinese Dream of a world order in its own
image, which I call [the **China Order**]{.underline}. The China Order
is a millennia-old political tradition and ideology that mandates [a
unitary, authoritarian]{.underline} (often totalitarian), [omnipotent
and omnipresent government for the **whole**]{.underline} known
**[world]{.underline}**. This alternative world order has had a variety
of euphemisms in the long history of China: from tinaxia yitong
(unification of all under heaven) and shijie datong (world's grand
harmony) in the imperial past, to Mao Zedong's world solidarity for
Communist revolution only forty years ago, to now Xi Jinping's community
of common human destiny. The China Order has powerfully revived to guide
rising PRC power, under the banner of a Chinese version of
globalization, ingeniously taking advantage of the various calls in our
time for [global [governance]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[address]{.mark}
**transnational issues** such as **[climate]{.mark} change**,
[**inequality**, **epidemics**, and **terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This [China]{.mark} Order is]{.underline} normatively and practically
[[at]{.mark} **fundamental [odds]{.mark}** [with the
**LIO**]{.mark}]{.underline} version of the Westphalia system [that
enshrines]{.underline} comparison and competition among [nations
**coexisting** with equal sovereignty]{.underline}. The China Order has
been widely addictive to the powerful and ambitious in history, whether
they have been ethnically Han or not. It has been highly effective in
practice, in great part because it became deeply legitimized and
internalized in elite Chinese culture over many centuries. The China
Order is now the sole acceptable model of the world under the
authoritarianism known as the Qin-Han polity that the PRC now practices.
But under this world order, as documented by [The China
Order]{.underline} (#ad), human civilization [is socio-economically very
**suboptimal** and **hopelessly stagnant**]{.underline}, inevitably
shortchanging the lives of just about everyone, especially nonelites, as
the tragic and often catastrophic history of Eastern Eurasia under the
China Order before the nineteenth century amply demonstrates. Since
1949, when the PRC restored traditional Chinese autocracy under the
guise of imported Marxism-Leninism, [the CCP has been
**ceaselessly**]{.underline} and callously [fighting its **own people**
internally and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**American allies**]{.underline} externally [to preserve its monopoly
**over power**. Only **sheer exhaustion**]{.underline} and near collapse
[could force the CCP to **slow down** and **retreat**]{.underline}, at
home and abroad. External powers have influenced and facilitated the
rise of PRC power, but have so far failed to transform the Qin-Han
autocracy and its China Order ideal, thus remaining unable to change
Beijing's world views and global pursuits. Various, often false,
[rationalizations have justified]{.underline} the continuation of
[American]{.underline}/Western [engagement with the PRC,
which]{.underline} has greatly enriched and [**enabled** the CCP to
persist in its **[consolidation]{.mark} of power**. Beijing's push for
power [is]{.mark}]{.underline} nothing personal; it is [a brand of
authoritarianism]{.underline} just happens to be [[**anchored**
in]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkably persistent [[belief that
**failing**]{.mark} **to achieve control** over the whole]{.underline}
known [world [would spell]{.mark} the loss of the "mandate of heaven"
and **political [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the CCP is
driven (or doomed) to methodically and opportunistically seek ever
greater influence. [The **[rise]{.mark} of China**]{.underline}, or more
precisely the ever-greater power of the PRC state, [represents a shift
of the distribution]{.underline} and concentration [of power in the
international system]{.underline} (conceptually known as power
transition) [and an effort to **reorder the units**]{.underline} in the
system [and change the system's **governing norms**. Chinese
leaders]{.underline} have already **[openly claimed]{.underline}** that
[they are]{.underline} now moving to [the center of the world stage,
leading a revolutionary change in]{.underline} the [world order,
**[upending]{.mark}** the **Peace of [Westphalia]{.mark}**]{.underline}
established "four hundred years ago," in the words of PRC leaders [This
points to a systemic change of world politics]{.underline} and a choice
for all of us at the grandest possible scale: a scale [that could
reshape nations [and **redirect**]{.mark} **the path** of **human
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The PRC's challenge is therefore
greater than the struggle between the two European ideologies of
Capitalism and Communism. [The confrontation between the **U.S.-led
LIO** and the PRC-dreamed **China Order** transcends]{.underline} these
often vaguely defined [civilizational clashes]{.underline}. If the PRC
challenge, the rise of an unscrupulous, ever more resourceful and
determined PRC state, is not managed well and promptly, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[will]{.mark} have to [face]{.mark}]{.underline} a much worse choice in
the not too distant future between tragic capitulation and a
[**desperate [war]{.mark}** for its national security [and]{.mark}
**world leadership**]{.underline} and for the way in which humankind is
organized worldwide. [In the age of]{.underline} many kinds of
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction, this will be a harrowing
decision. Of course, one may argue that the grandiose China Dream of a
China Order may be just another pretentious way for the CCP to invoke
traditional, nationalist, and populist ideals to justify its autocratic
governance of the Chinese people forever, similar to the splendid
slogans and missions fabricated by many other dictators. Perhaps the
highly insecure CCP leadership is fighting for its survival, not world
domination. However, words have consequences. Propaganda and dilution
often greatly mesmerize and mislead the pretenders themselves. More
importantly, [the CCP has been **steadily following**]{.underline} up
[its words with action]{.underline} and money for years (basically
nonstop since 1949); it has just pledged over 10 times the total sum of
the Marshall Plan (in today's dollars) for its Belt and Road Initiative
alone, for instance. As the logic of the China Order dictates,
[[the]{.mark} rising Chinese [power will **not stop**]{.mark} **short**
of [**unseating** the]{.mark} **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **reordering the [world]{.mark}**[,
unless]{.mark}]{.underline} Beijing's Qin-Han polity is transformed
and/or [the]{.underline} ever richer and more [powerful PRC is
[checked]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alternatives, [American
**capitulation** or **world war**, are]{.underline} horrific to
contemplate, but [not]{.underline} necessarily [impossible]{.underline}.
Unlike in Hollywood, the "good" guys do not always win necessarily in
the real world. A mighty autocracy that tightly controls one-fifth of
humankind, willfully spends a disproportionately larger portion of the
fruits of the world's second largest economy, and vows (even if only
hypocritically) to reform and reorder the world under its leadership, is
and will always be a mortal challenge to the national security of the
United States. [[America's]{.mark} **global [position]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} way of life, **[world
[peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the overall world order [all [rest
on]{.mark} how the **[PRC]{.mark} challenge** is
managed]{.underline}---soon.

### US-China War- Nuclear

#### War over Taiwan goes nuclear.

Control Association, 10/13/22, "Could the Fight Over Taiwan Trigger
Nuclear War?"

In the days that followed, [[China]{.mark} also [sent
nuclear-capable]{.mark} H-6 [heavy bombers across the median]{.mark}
line [in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait, a previously respected
informal boundary between China and that island]{.underline}. Worse yet,
[[**state-owned media** displayed]{.mark} images of Dongfeng-17 (DF-17)
[hypersonic ballistic missiles]{.mark}, also believed [capable of
**carrying**]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
being moved into positions off Taiwan.

[[Washington]{.mark} has not overtly deployed nuclear-capable
weaponry]{.underline} in such a brazen fashion near Chinese territory,
but it [certainly has [sent aircraft carriers and]{.mark}
guided-[missile warships]{.mark} into the area, [signaling]{.mark} its
[ability to launch attacks]{.mark} on the mainland should a war break
out]{.underline}. While Pelosi was in Taiwan, for example, the Navy
deployed the carrier USS Ronald Reagan with its flotilla of escort
vessels in nearby waters. [Military [officials in both countries
are]{.mark} all too [aware]{.mark} that [should]{.mark} such ships [ever
attack Chinese territory]{.mark}, those DF-15s and DF-17s would be let
loose against them---and, if armed with nuclear warheads,
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[provoke]{.mark} a US [nuclear
response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### U.S.-China war goes [nuclear]{.underline}. 

**Talmadge 18**, Associate Professor of Security Studies at the Edmund
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. (Caitlin,
10/15/18, \"Beijing's Nuclear Option: Why a U.S.-Chinese War Could
Spiral Out of Control\", *Foreign Affairs*,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/beijings-nuclear-option)

As China's power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of war
with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, [China has
**increased** its]{.underline} political and economic [pressure on
Taiwan and built **military installations** on coral reefs in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
fueling Washington's fears that [Chinese expansionism will **threaten
U.S. allies** and **influence** in the region]{.underline}. U.S.
destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from
Beijing. American policymakers have wondered aloud whether they should
send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well. Chinese fighter
jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the South China
Sea. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought long-simmering
economic disputes to a rolling boil. A war between the two countries
remains unlikely, but the prospect of [a **military
confrontation**---resulting, for example, from a Chinese campaign
against Taiwan---**no longer seems** as **implausible**]{.underline} as
it once did. And [the odds of such a confrontation **going nuclear** are
**higher** than most policymakers and analysts **think**.]{.underline}
Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero." [This assurance is **misguided**]{.underline}. If
deployed against China, [the Pentagon's preferred style of]{.underline}
conventional [warfare would be a]{.underline} potential **[recipe for
nuclear escalation]{.underline}**. Since the end of the Cold War, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [signature approach to war has
been simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly knock
out the opponent's key military assets]{.underline} at minimal cost. But
the Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power.
[China]{.underline}, by contrast, not only [has nuclear
weapons]{.underline}; it has also **[intermingled]{.underline}** them
[with]{.underline} its **[conventional]{.underline}** military
[**forces**, making it difficult to **attack one** without **attacking
the other**]{.underline}. This means that [a **major**]{.underline} U.S.
military **[campaign]{.underline}** [targeting China's conventional
forces would likely also **threaten its nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}.
Faced with such a threat, [Chinese leaders could decide to **use their
nuc**lear weapon**s** while they were **still able to.**]{.underline} As
U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a relationship fraught with mutual
suspicion, they must come to grips with the fact that [a conventional
war could **skid into a nuclear confrontation**]{.underline}. Although
this risk is not high in absolute terms, its consequences for the region
and the world would be devastating. As long as the United States and
China continue to pursue their current grand strategies, [the risk is
**likely to endure**]{.underline}. This means that leaders on both sides
should dispense with the illusion that they can easily fight a limited
war. They should focus instead on managing or resolving the political,
economic, and military tensions that might lead to a conflict in the
first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some reasons for optimism.
For one, China has long stood out for its nonaggressive nuclear
doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964, China largely avoided
the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller and simpler nuclear
arsenal than its resources would have allowed. Chinese leaders have
consistently characterized nuclear weapons as useful only for deterring
nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically, this narrow purpose
required only a handful of nuclear weapons that could ensure Chinese
retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day, China maintains a
"no first use" pledge, promising that it will never be the first to use
nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict can also seem like a
relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States and its allies lived
in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning Europe. NATO
stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such an attack.
Both Washington and Moscow also consistently worried that their nuclear
forces could be taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear strike by the
other side. This mutual fear increased the risk that one superpower
might rush to launch in the erroneous belief that it was already under
attack. Initially, the danger of unauthorized strikes also loomed large.
In the 1950s, lax safety procedures for U.S. nuclear weapons stationed
on NATO soil, as well as minimal civilian oversight of U.S. military
commanders, raised a serious risk that nuclear escalation could have
occurred without explicit orders from the U.S. president. The good news
is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on U.S.-Chinese
relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the other's
territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a nuclear
bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear weapons is
relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory, is the
comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two nuclear
powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that its
enemy will respond in kind. The bad news is that [one other trigger
remains: a **conventional war** that **threatens China's nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline}. [**Conventional forces** can threaten nuclear
forces in ways that **generate pressures to escalate**---**especially**
when ever more capable U.S. conventional forces face adversaries with
relatively **small** and **fragile nuclear arsenals**, such as China. If
U.S. operations **endangered** or **damaged** China's nuclear forces,
Chinese leaders might come to think that Washington had aims **beyond**
winning the **conventional war**]{.underline}---[that it might be
seeking to]{.underline} ~~disable~~ or [**destroy China's nuclear
arsenal outright**, perhaps as a **prelude to regime change**. In the
**fog of war**, Beijing might reluctantly conclude that **limited
nuclear escalation**]{.underline}---an initial strike small enough that
it could avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation---[was]{.underline} a
**[viable]{.underline}** option to defend itself. STRAIT SHOOTERS [The
most worrisome flash point for a U.S.-Chinese war is
**Taiwan**.]{.underline} Beijing's long-term objective of reunifying the
island with mainland China is clearly in conflict with Washington's
longstanding desire to maintain the status quo in the strait. It is not
difficult to imagine how this might lead to war. For example, [China
could decide that the political or military window for regaining control
over the island was closing and **launch an attack**]{.underline}, using
air and naval forces to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bombard the
island. Although U.S. law does not require Washington to intervene in
such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States
will "consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other
than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the
peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to
the United States." Were Washington to intervene on Taipei's behalf, the
world's sole superpower and its rising competitor would find themselves
in the first great-power war of the twenty-first century. In the course
of such a war, [U.S. conventional military operations would likely
**threaten**]{.underline}, ~~disable~~, or outright eliminate some
[Chinese **nuclear capabilities**]{.underline}---whether doing so was
Washington's stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States
engaged in the style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years,
[this outcome would be **all but guaranteed**]{.underline}. Consider
submarine warfare. China could use its conventionally armed attack
submarines to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bomb the island, or to
attack U.S. and allied forces in the region. If that happened, [the U.S.
Navy would almost certainly undertake an **antisubmarine campaign**,
which would likely threaten China's]{.underline} "boomers," the four
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-armed **[ballistic missile
submarines]{.underline}** that form its naval nuclear deterrent. China's
conventionally armed and nuclear-armed submarines share the same
shore-based communications system; [a U.S. attack on these transmitters
would thus not only disrupt the activities of China's attack submarine
force but also cut off its boomers from **contact with
Beijing**]{.underline}, leaving Chinese leaders unsure of the fate of
their naval nuclear force. In addition, nuclear ballistic missile
submarines depend on attack submarines for protection, just as lumbering
bomber aircraft rely on nimble fighter jets. If the United States
started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it would be sinking the very
force that protects China's ballistic missile submarines, leaving the
latter dramatically more vulnerable. Even more dangerous, [U.S. forces
hunting Chinese attack submarines could **inadvertently** sink a Chinese
boomer instead]{.underline}. After all, at least some Chinese attack
submarines might be escorting ballistic missile submarines, especially
in wartime, when China might flush its boomers from their ports and try
to send them within range of the continental United States. Since
correctly identifying targets remains one of the trickiest challenges of
undersea warfare, a U.S. submarine crew might come within shooting range
of a Chinese submarine without being sure of its type, especially in a
crowded, noisy environment like the Taiwan Strait. [Platitudes about
caution are **easy in peacetime**. In wartime, when Chinese attack
submarines might already have launched **deadly strikes**, the U.S. crew
might decide to **shoot first** and **ask questions
later.**]{.underline} Adding to China's sense of vulnerability, the
small size of its nuclear-armed submarine force means that just two such
incidents would eliminate half of its sea-based deterrent. Meanwhile,
any Chinese boomers that escaped this fate would likely be cut off from
communication with onshore commanders, left without an escort force, and
unable to return to destroyed ports. If that happened, China would
essentially have no naval nuclear deterrent. [The situation is similar
onshore, where any U.S. military campaign would have to contend with
China's growing land-based conventional ballistic missile force. Much of
this force is **within range of Taiwan**]{.underline}, ready to launch
ballistic missiles against the island or at any allies coming to its
aid. Once again, U.S. victory would hinge on the ability to degrade this
conventional ballistic missile force. And once again, it would be
virtually impossible to do so while leaving China's nuclear ballistic
missile force unscathed. [Chinese conventional and nuclear ballistic
missiles are often **attached to the same base headquarters**, meaning
that they likely share **transportation** and **supply networks**,
**patrol routes**, and other **supporting infrastructure**]{.underline}.
[It is]{.underline} also [possible that they **share** some
**c**ommand-and-**c**ontrol **networks**]{.underline}, [or that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates would [be **unable to
distinguish** between the conventional and nuclear networks even if they
were physically separate.]{.underline} To add to the challenge, [some of
China's ballistic missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear
warhead, and the two versions are virtually **indistinguishable to U.S.
aerial surveillance**]{.underline}. In a war, [targeting the
conventional variants would likely mean **destroying** some **nuclear
ones in the process**.]{.underline} Furthermore, sending manned aircraft
to attack Chinese missile launch sites and bases would require at least
partial control of the airspace over China, which in turn would require
weakening Chinese air defenses. But degrading China's coastal air
defense network in order to fight a conventional war would also leave
much of its nuclear force without protection. Once China was under
attack, its leaders might come to fear that even intercontinental
ballistic missiles located deep in the country's interior were
vulnerable. For years, observers have pointed to the U.S. military's
failed attempts to locate and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the
1990--91 Gulf War as evidence that mobile missiles are virtually
impervious to attack. Therefore, the thinking goes, China could retain a
nuclear deterrent no matter what harm U.S. forces inflicted on its
coastal areas. Yet recent research suggests otherwise. Chinese
intercontinental ballistic missiles are larger and less mobile than the
Iraqi Scuds were, and they are harder to move without detection. The
United States is also likely to have been tracking them much more
closely in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to view a failed
Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that its residual
nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing,
high-intensity conventional war. China's vehement criticism of a U.S.
regional missile defense system designed to guard against a potential
North Korean attack already reflects these latent fears. Beijing's worry
is that this system could help Washington block the handful of missiles
China might launch in the aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal.
That sort of campaign might seem much more plausible in Beijing's eyes
if a conventional war had already begun to seriously undermine other
parts of China's nuclear deterrent. It does not help that China's
real-time awareness of the state of its forces would probably be
limited, since blinding the adversary is a standard part of the U.S.
military playbook. [Put simply, the favored U.S. strategy to **ensure a
conventional victory** would likely **endanger** much of China's nuclear
arsenal **in the process**, at sea and on la]{.underline}nd. [Whether
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [**actually intended** to
target all of China's nuclear weapons would be **incidental**. **All
that would matter** is that Chinese leaders would **consider them
threatened.**]{.underline} LESSONS FROM THE PAST At that point, the
question becomes, [How will China react? Will it practice restraint and
uphold the "no first use" pledge once its nuclear forces appear to be
under attack?]{.underline} Or will it use those weapons while it still
can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt the U.S. campaign
or intimidate Washington into backing down? Chinese writings and
statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this point. It is unclear
which exact set of capabilities China considers part of its core nuclear
deterrent and which it considers less crucial. For example, if China
already recognizes that its sea-based nuclear deterrent is relatively
small and weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile submarines in
a war might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its calculus. The
danger lies in [wartime developments that could **shift China's
assumptions** about U.S. intentions. If Beijing interprets the
**erosion**]{.underline} [of its]{.underline} sea- and land-based
[nuclear forces as a deliberate effort to destroy its nuclear deterrent,
or perhaps even as a **prelude to a nuclear attack**, it might see
limited nuclear escalation as a way to **force an end to the
conflict**]{.underline}. For example, [China could use nuclear weapons
to instantaneously destroy the U.S. air bases that posed the **biggest
threat to its arsenal**]{.underline}. [It could also launch a nuclear
strike **with no direct military purpose**]{.underline}---on an
unpopulated area or at sea---[as a way to **signal** that the United
States had **crossed a redline.**]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark}'s decades long **military [buildup]{.mark}** now [poses
a **threat**]{.mark} to U.S. security not just in Asia but also
**[around the globe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and a **confrontation**
with China could emerge [at]{.mark} one of several
**[flashpoints]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a senior Pentagon official warned
Thursday. Chad Sbragia, deputy assistant defense secretary for China,
told a congressional commission that [Beijing's buildup of **missiles**,
**warships**, **aircraft**, **space weaponry** and
**cybercapabilities**]{.underline} [has accelerated under President
Xi]{.underline} Jinping. He described it as "one of the most ambitious
military modernization efforts in recent history." [["In]{.mark} most of
the potential flashpoints]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific region ---
[the **[Taiwan]{.mark}** Strait[, the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea, the [Senkaku Islands or]{.mark} the
**[Korea]{.mark}**n Peninsula]{.underline} --- [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [may find]{.mark} itself in [a **military
crisis**]{.mark} with China]{.underline}," Mr. Sbragia told a hearing of
the congressionally created United States-China Economic and Security
Review Commission. He said the challenge posed by Chinese military and
economic expansion requires a Cold War-type response. [While not a
replica of]{.underline} the standoff with [the Soviet Union in the Cold
War, the China threat is "equally as consequential]{.underline} and
therefore merits the same concentration of effort as put forth in the
past," he said. [China's military]{.underline} now [boasts 2 million
personnel]{.underline} in uniform. [The Chinese navy]{.underline}, after
decades of building large numbers of warships, [is now the
world's]{.underline} **[largest]{.underline}** [in terms of total
assets]{.underline}, he said. [["China's]{.mark} **military** is
[fielding]{.mark} an increasingly [formidable]{.mark} array of
**ballistic** and]{.underline} **[cruise]{.underline}** [missiles,
modern fighter aircraft, autonomous systems, and a suite of **cyber**
and **space [capabilities]{.mark}**, postured to **deny** the U.S.
**military access**]{.underline} to the Indo-Pacific theater if called
upon," Mr. Sbragia said. [Military [**power projection** efforts
are]{.mark} also [linked to]{.mark} China's **expanding [economic
might]{.mark}** through such programs as]{.underline} Mr. [Xi's **B**elt
and **R**oad **I**nitiative and military-civilian fusion. China's single
overseas military base]{.underline} in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa,
[is just the beginning of a]{.underline} **[global basing
structure]{.underline}** [to match the U.S. military's]{.underline}
reach, U.S. officials say. "In other words, [it is not a matter of
**whether** the]{.underline} \[**[P]{.underline}**eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy\] [intends to
establish another military base]{.underline} overseas, [but **when** and
**how**]{.underline} they plan to do it," Mr. Sbragia said. "[The
implications]{.underline} of China's military modernization [are
profound. [This is a long-term challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} that will
require sustained funding and strategic planning to address ...," Mr.
Sbragia said. "[There is no zero-cost solution to global competition
with China]{.underline}." Global ambitions The Capitol Hill hearing also
included witnesses who revealed how [Chinese military [power is
expanding]{.mark} globally [and could]{.mark} help **[spread]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark} ruling Communist [Party's **authoritarian
model**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Isaac B. Kardon, a professor at the Naval
War College, said [the PLA navy could use a network of Chinese
commercial ports for logistics in projecting military power. Chinese
companies]{.underline}, he noted, [own or operate 94 ports around the
world]{.underline}, including the ports at either end of the Panama
Canal. "[The \[Chinese navy\] depends on **commercial
ports**]{.underline} [to support its **growing operations**]{.underline}
[overseas]{.underline}," he said. Mr. Kardon cited an unidentified PLA
officer who was quoted as saying of the Pakistani port of Gwadar that
"the food is already on the plate. We'll eat it whenever we want to."
[[Beijing]{.mark} also [has set]{.mark} as [a goal]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**reunification of [Taiwan]{.mark}** with the mainland
by 2049]{.underline}, the 100th anniversary of the rise to power of Mao
Zedong's communists. [By 2035, China plans to deploy a high-technology
force with **modernized weapons**]{.underline} [and command and control
systems to be able to follow]{.underline} Mr. [Xi's guidance to "fight
and win wars."]{.underline} Mr. Sbragia said [China outlined its goals
in a]{.underline} 2019 military [white paper that called for the
**P**]{.underline}eople's **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy [to "safeguard China's **overseas interests**"
by]{.underline} such means as [building "offshore forces" and **overseas
bases**]{.underline}. Chinese military strategists justify the expansion
by saying the PLA will be "fulfilling international obligations" to
secure the global commons and that Beijing will "never threaten any
other country or seek any sphere of influence." [[In the]{.underline}
**[Arctic]{.underline}**, [China is deploying]{.underline}]{.mark}
[civilian [research organizations]{.mark} that could be used [for
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[military presence]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** [and the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea are
**prime flashpoints**]{.underline} [for a direct
U.S.-clash]{.underline}, Mr. Sbragia said. He was reiterating U.S.
complaints that [Beijing has "increasingly employed **coercive** tactics
and measures in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea to deny claimants the
legitimate regulation, exploitation and use of maritime natural
resources]{.underline} in their exclusive economic zones." The
Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy concluded that [[China is
seeking]{.mark} **regional hegemony** in the Indo-Pacific and
"[**displacement** of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates to
achieve global preeminence in the future]{.underline}." Defense
Secretary Mark Esper has said repeatedly that a rising China is his
department's top security challenge. A break with the past The Pentagon
testimony breaks with previous intelligence assessments that China's
military ambitions were limited to retaking Taiwan. The Pentagon's 2003
annual report to Congress on the Chinese military concluded that
"preparing for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait is the primary
driver for China's military modernization." Subsequent annual surveys
emphasized that the buildup was limited to Taiwan but noted that China's
military was also interested in taking part in international
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Few of the reports suggested
that China had global ambitions to achieve military dominance, as
conservative military analysts have argued for years. Spokesmen for the
National Intelligence Council and Defense Intelligence Agency had no
immediate comments on the shifting arguments. Retired Navy Capt. Jim
Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said Mr. Sbragia's
testimony was encouraging. ["Even as short as [five years ago]{.mark},
the U.S. intelligence community's **conventional [wisdom]{.mark}**
[held]{.mark} that the PRC's [leaders were]{.mark} primarily [focused on
']{.mark}**domestic [concerns]{.mark}**[' of]{.mark} **regime
[survival]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} enacting **military
[modernization]{.mark}** for regional purposes]{.underline} in order to
resolve territorial disputes within the 'first island chain,'" said
Capt. Fanell, referring to the island stretching north to south close to
China's east coast. "Despite this all-to-common failure to recognize the
PRC's strategic intentions, the fact is the PRC has and continues to
build a naval force that if left unchallenged will not only be sailing
the seven seas, as it is today, but will increasingly be able to achieve
sea control in the global maritime commons as early as 2030, and
potentially even sea superiority by 2049," he said. Capt. Fanell said
[the [institutional bias to **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[China's [strategic intentions]{.mark} and PLA modernization and global
operations [should lead to]{.mark} updates]{.underline} of the language
of the 2018 national defense statement, [[deeming China]{.mark} a
**strategic adversary** or **[enemy]{.mark}** rather than a strategic
competitor.]{.underline} Rick Fisher, a China military analyst, said a
small community of skeptics and conservatives can claim vindication with
Mr. Sbragia's testimony, which echoes what they have been saying for
over two decades: that an unconstrained China will become a global
threat to America. "Conservatives have also long warned that [China's
ambitions go well beyond simply taking over Taiwan]{.underline}," Mr.
Fisher said. "[What [China]{.mark} will try to do to Taiwan
is]{.underline} simply [the **template**]{.underline} [for how it
[will]{.mark} eventually]{.underline} [**[threaten every]{.mark} other
[democracy]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conflict;\" *National Interest*;

What does the DOD mean by "order?" In the field of international
relations, the terms "revisionist state" and "status-quo state" are used
to describe, respectively, countries that seek to change the current
international system and those that uphold it. In the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, [the international system has been defined by
**American hegemony** and the **spread** of]{.underline} Western liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** rather than its challengers---notably,
fascism and socialism. [This is]{.underline} commonly referred to as
[the **liberal world order.**]{.underline}

Under that world order, [the United States]{.underline} is the most
powerful country in the world. It often intervenes in international
conflicts at a high cost, thus [keep]{.underline}ing [**dissatisfied
nations** from **overturning the system**]{.underline}. The NDS,
however, refers to a recent shift in the current world order with an
observation that, "[We are facing **global disorder**, characterized by
**decline** in the]{.underline} long-standing rules-based [international
order]{.underline}."

The basis for that observation is the argument that the United States
under the Obama administration took a brief, but arguably consequential,
step back from the job of world-order maintenance. As proof of this,
foreign-policy pundits often refer to Obama's favorite quote (which he
got from Martin Luther King Jr., who in turn got it from a
nineteenth-century clergyman named Theodore Parker): "\[T\]he arc of the
moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." The implication of
this quote is that history is ultimately on the side of good rather than
evil (e.g., dictatorships), and therefore the United States needn't
concern itself with great power competition or world order strategy.
Critics point out that the president's faith in that sentiment was put
to poor use, however, because it led him to apologize for American power
and to enact [a more **restrained foreign policy** that in turn allowed
**revisionist states** like Russia, China and Iran to **flourish** at
the expense of their respective regions' security]{.underline}. As
Charles Krauthammer harshly wrote in the final months of the
administration: "[The]{.underline} consequent **[withdrawal of American
power]{.underline}** ... [has yielded]{.underline} nothing but
[**geopolitical chaos** and **immense human suffering**]{.underline}.
(See Syria.)."

And that\'s not exactly a partisan argument either. In addition to
conservative critics like Krauthammer, left-leaning foreign policy
scholars, like Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institute, also have been
critical of the results of the Obama administration\'s well-intentioned
foreign policy.

The NDS promises to reverse the "arc of history" approach to security
policy with a three-tiered approach that prioritizes the "revisionist
powers" of China and Russia, then "rogue regimes" like Iran and North
Korea, and finally "nonstate actors" such as ISIS.

Of course, this new approach may alleviate serious concerns about the
NSS---including my own---that the United States government no longer
cares about global security. But policy will only follow well-written
sentiment if President Trump himself can accept that [America is the
**glue** holding together an **entire world order**]{.underline}.

[With China **now poised** to **reclaim its previous spot** in world
history as a global hegemon, the proverbial clock is turning
back]{.underline}. And that appears to be the reason why the DOD is
serious about America being in the business of world order maintenance.
As stated in the NDS: "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism,
is now the primary concern in U.S. national security."

Indeed, [China already has a **strong economy**. It represents almost
**15 percent** of the **global GDP**]{.underline} to America's roughly
24 percent. But, to put that in a slightly different perspective, China
has grown astronomically in the last decade to overtake Japan as the
second largest global economy. [Thus, there is a real possibility that
in the near future]{.underline} (likely decades) [it may be able to
surpass even the United States and then harness its capital to develop
**superior military technology**]{.underline}. [At **that point,** China
would be capable of **overthrowing the current international
system.**]{.underline}

[The world has **not seen global conflict**]{.underline} the likes of
World War I and II [since the United States became the **dominant
power**]{.underline}. Nor, for that matter, has it seen a recurrence of
the great power conflicts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As
the new defense strategy implies, [take **U.S. hegemony** out of that
equation and **great powers** may **clash once again** to the detriment
of a cherished world order.]{.underline}

Currently, [America's global dominance is passing through unprecedented
strain]{.underline}, [driven by]{.underline} the world's unmistakable
shift toward [multipolarity]{.underline} and its own internal
challenges. [Emerging powers]{.underline}, especially China,
[are]{.underline} gradually reconstructing the international system [and
testing the stability of]{.underline} the [American hegemony. The
Indo-Pacific]{.underline} -- **[a key driver of]{.underline}** economic
**[growth, accounting for 60% of the world's GDP]{.underline}** and
containing globally critical trade routes -- [is home to four of the
largest economies]{.underline}. [Its emerging markets are reshaping
modern global trade patterns]{.underline} and have become the primary
theater for geoeconomic and geopolitical contests. [For the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, **[prioritizing this
region]{.underline}** is not merely strategic -- it **[is imperative for
maintaining its leadership in the 21st century]{.underline}**. **[Any
slippage in the U.S. involvement could have far-reaching implications
for the U.S. growth]{.underline}**. Hence, [the legacy of]{.underline}
Joe [Biden]{.underline}, marked with significant shortcomings and gaps
in the region, [needs to be addressed immediately and substantially
improved.]{.underline}

[[Over]{.mark} the past **[seventy years]{.mark}**]{.underline},
Democratic and Republican [administrations]{.underline} alike have
[understood]{.underline} that [**[America]{.mark}n**
security]{.underline} and prosperity [at home are **linked**
to]{.underline} economic and political [health **abroad**, and that
America **does better** when]{.underline} other [countries have the
**incentive** and]{.underline} the [**capacity** to **work alongside**
us in tackling **global challenges**]{.underline}. This is why [we
constructed a system of **international institutions** and **security
alliances** after World War II. They [provided a **framework**
for]{.mark} advancing **economic openness** and]{.underline} political
[freedom]{.underline} in the years that followed. [The **international
order** America **built** and **led**]{.underline} has not been perfect,
but it [has coincided with a **period of [security]{.mark}** and
prosperity [**unmatched** in]{.mark}]{.underline} human
[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [while many nations benefited
from]{.underline} the [investments]{.underline} America made [in global
security]{.underline} and prosperity, [none]{.underline} benefited [more
than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Yet today, [the value
of America's **global engagement** is **under question**]{.underline}. A
substantial number of Americans feel that their lives and livelihoods
have been threatened rather than enhanced by it. They view international
trade as having shuttered the factories at which they worked, immigrants
as threatening their standard of living or safety, and globalization as
undermining American culture. This popular dissatisfaction needs to be
understood and acknowledged. Washington needs to ensure that the
benefits of America's international engagement are shared by all of our
citizens. But [we]{.underline} also [need to be clear about the
**consequences** of **disengagement**]{.underline}. For [while it is
comforting to believe]{.underline} that [we can **wall ourselves off**
from]{.underline} the ailments of [the world, **history** teaches
us]{.underline} that [whenever problems abroad are allowed to **fester**
and **grow**]{.underline}, sooner or later, [they come home]{.underline}
to America. [**Isolationism** and retreat **do not work**]{.underline};
we know because [we have **tried them before**. We]{.underline} also
[know, from]{.underline} recent [experience]{.underline}, that [[if
**America recedes**]{.mark} from the global stage, people in
[**Africa**, **Asia**, **Europe**]{.mark}, **Latin [America]{.mark}**[,
and the]{.mark} **Middle [East]{.mark}** will]{.underline} increasingly
[[look]{.mark} elsewhere for]{.underline} inspiration and
[guidance]{.underline} -- whether [[to **authoritarian**]{.mark}**ism**
[or **extremist**]{.mark} **ideology**]{.underline}. In our opinion,
[such a shift would]{.underline} be harmful to the interests of those
populations, but it would [be **harmful**]{.underline} above all [to the
interests of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [because our
security and our prosperity **depend** on having **friends abroad** that
share our values]{.underline} -- [including]{.underline} our belief in
the **[rule of law]{.underline}**, freedom of movement, and access to
markets. [[Neither **Russia** nor **China** proclaim]{.mark} the **same
[loyalty]{.mark}** to those principles]{.underline} as we do. [Were they
to **fill [a vacuum]{.mark}** left by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [it could]{.underline} very well [**[mark]{.mark}
a [return]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a **[balance of power]{.mark}** system,
[where]{.mark} the world's]{.underline} major [[powers
**competed**]{.mark} **militarily** for territory and **spheres of
[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} at great human and financial cost.
[This is a world]{.underline} to which **[none of us]{.underline}**
should [want to return]{.underline}. [America's continued **global
[leadership]{.mark}** cannot be taken for granted, but]{.underline} a
[**retreat into isolationism** is not preordained]{.underline}. We have
an opportunity -- and, in our view, an obligation -- to defend those
aspects of the international system that work in the twenty-first
century, and to adapt those that do not. In doing so, we should
acknowledge that the existing order is in need of revision and
refurbishment. [The international]{.underline} system was designed for a
different era, and it requires a renewal of purpose and a reform of its
structures. Its mission [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} more [**clearly
[extend]{.mark}** beyond preventing war in **Europe** [to]{.mark}
include **[stabilizing]{.mark}** other **strategic
[regions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that affect our well-being. Its approach
should reflect the fact that [long-term stability **depends** on
well-governed states]{.underline} whose leaders are [seen as
legitimate]{.underline} by their people. And its structure must be
adapted to the realities of a world in which power is more diffuse, so
other countries can take on a greater role commensurate with the
contributions they make and the responsibilities they assume.
[**China**, **Russia**, and **other [countries]{.mark}** should
[understand]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[there is a]{.mark} **larger
[place]{.mark}** for them [at the]{.mark} **decision-making
[table]{.mark}**[, provided they are **constructive**]{.mark} and
respect]{.underline} the interests of [other nations]{.underline}. And
[they need to understand]{.underline} that [[there **will be costs**
if]{.mark} they do [not]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this and other
reasons, [[U.S.]{.mark} **military [power]{.mark}** will **[remain
vital]{.mark}** in a renewed **international order**. We
appreciate]{.underline} this committee's [efforts to ensure]{.underline}
that [our military remains the **best-trained**, **best-equipped**, and
**best-led** force on earth. [Given]{.mark} the **[variety of
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} facing our country, [it makes sense to
continue **upgrading** and enhancing]{.underline} our country's military
capabilities and [deterrent power]{.underline}. But we strongly believe
that it would be a mistake to increase defense spending at the expense
of other critical investments in national security -- especially those
in diplomacy, development, democracy, and peacebuilding. [We know from
experience that [**force**, and]{.mark} the **credible
[possibility]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} its [use, are **essential**]{.mark}
to defend]{.underline} our [vital interests]{.underline} and keep
America safe. But as one of us has said in the past, [force **alone**
can be a **blunt instrument**]{.underline}, and there are many problems
it cannot solve. The military leaders who so frequently testify before
this committee would be the first to tell you that they cannot succeed
in their missions without the vital capabilities that our civilian
agencies bring to the table. Gutting these capabilities will put an
unacceptable burden on our men and women in uniform, and would make
America less safe. We need to fund these other civilian elements of
American power as robustly as we do the military element.

#### [No other]{.underline} country will promote liberal values. 

**Traub '17** \[James; January 3; Fellow at the Center on International
Cooperation; Foreign Policy, "Donald Trump: Making the World Safe for
Dictators,"
<http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/03/donald-trump-is-making-the-world-safe-for-dictators/>\]

Presidents keep returning to these formulations because Wilson was right
about the relationship between democracy and the modern world order.
There's another reason as well: At least [since]{.underline} the end of
[World War II, the idea]{.underline} that [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [**stands for
something** more than its]{.underline} own [self-interest [has
**underwritten**]{.mark}]{.underline} its [claims to **world
[leadership]{.mark}**. That]{.underline} idea [is the **basis** of
America's "**soft power**.]{.underline}" The Marshall Plan, to take the
most famous example, did almost as much for the United States, by
enhancing its global prestige, as it did for its European beneficiaries.
So [what]{.underline} happens [[if we **abandon** this]{.mark}
tradition?]{.underline} The silver lining of Trump's chilly agnosticism
toward democratic values might be this: No more hypocrisy. The Obama
administration has shaken a finger at autocratic allies in the Middle
East without inflicting or even threatening serious consequences, thus
offending foreign governments without mitigating their brutalities. On
the other side, Obama has halfheartedly supported Syrian rebels without
making any effort to tip the scales of the horrendous civil war there.
Trump will deliver no lectures, and may openly join Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad in his alleged campaign against Islamic extremism.
Honesty bought at [such]{.underline} a price, however, [is a commodity
**not worth having**]{.underline}. President [Trump might]{.underline}
well [feel]{.underline} more [comfortable with]{.underline} the
increasingly [**[illiberal states]{.mark}** of Eastern
**Europe**]{.underline} --- including [Russia, the **fountainhead** of
**anti-liberal** doctrine]{.underline} --- [than]{.underline} with
[the]{.underline} social [democratic West. One can]{.underline} all too
easily [imagine]{.underline} him launching [a fusillade]{.underline} of
tweets [at Atlantic **allies** who]{.underline} stubbornly
[[persist]{.mark} in]{.underline} using [the language of universal
rights]{.underline}, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who
not-so-subtly warned the incoming president to abide by Western values.
How long will it be, in fact, before "Western values" can no longer be
used as a taken-for-granted synonym for secularism, individual freedom,
or tolerance for diverse opinion? But [there's a more **subtle
consequence** to **forswearing** America's traditional]{.underline}
moral [claims about its **global role**. [The
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.mark}
able to serve as **honest [broker]{.mark}** [in disputes]{.mark} **all
over the world** because it is not seen, as]{.underline} for example
[China is, as a **prop** to **existing regimes**]{.underline}, however
odious. Thus the Obama administration's patient [diplomacy]{.underline}
in Myanmar [has given the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**influence** with]{.underline} both ne[w democratic
leaders]{.underline} and the former military regime. [What happens
if]{.underline} any of Trump's favorite [**strongmen** are
overthrown]{.underline} or, God help them, voted out of office? What
influence will Washington have with the successor regime?
[[How]{.underline}]{.mark}, more broadly, [[will America compete with
**China's**]{.mark} growing **soft [power]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} even
[**Russia's**?]{.mark} Putin's **greatest windfall**]{.underline} in
recent years [has not been his]{.underline} stealth [conquest of
**Crimea** or winning the **war in Syria**]{.underline} for Assad,
[but]{.underline} rather [the **growing eclipse** of **liberal values**
across the West]{.underline}. Trump's election is a crucial part of that
bounty. (It seems increasingly clear that Putin deserves some credit for
that outcome thanks to Russia's hacking of damaging emails from
Democratic Party leaders.) The prestige of liberal democracy has not
sunk so low since the 1930s. Anti-liberal parties lead the polls in much
of Western Europe and now govern in Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. [[It
is]{.mark} a matter [of]{.mark} **greater
[urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline} today than it was after 9/11, [that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[act
as]{.mark} a [beacon]{.mark}]{.underline}** of, [[and
**spokesman**]{.mark} for, democracy]{.underline}. Yet
[under]{.underline} a President [Trump it will **cede that
role**]{.underline}. Who will inherit it? Germany, perhaps. But Merkel,
gravely weakened by her open-door policy toward refugees, may well lose
her bid to return as chancellor in September. In any case, [Germany is a
lesser power that]{.underline} in any case [has]{.underline} very
[strong **historical reasons** for speaking **softly** and
**modestly**]{.underline}. [[If the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[does not
lead]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the [promotion of democratic and liberal
principles, as it has for the]{.underline} last [century, **[no
one]{.mark} else [will]{.mark}**. And [that **vacuum** will be
**filled** by]{.mark} someone]{.underline} else [whose [values]{.mark}
are [**neither democratic** nor **liberal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Donald
Trump's promise to make American great again will have descended to
tragic farce.

Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, Senior
Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments; Bloomberg
Opinion, "America's Global Order Is Worth Fighting For,"
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-14/america-s-global-order-is-worth-fighting-for>\]

[The first argument is **easily disposed** of.]{.underline} Yes, [the
postwar world has been **thoroughly imperfect**]{.underline}, featuring
nuclear arms races, genocides, widespread poverty and other scourges.
[But the world has **always been** imperfect, and by **any** meaningful
**comparison**, the last **seven decades**]{.underline} [have been a
**veritable golden age**]{.underline}. [The **[liberal]{.mark}
international**]{.underline} economic [[order has led to an
**explosion** of **domestic** and **global
prosperity**]{.mark}:]{.underline} According to World Bank data, both
U.S. and [global **per capita** income have increased **roughly
three-fold**]{.underline} (in inflation-adjusted terms) since 1960, with
U.S. gross domestic product increasing nearly six-fold.
[The]{.underline} U.S. **[system]{.underline}** of alliances and forward
military deployments [has [**contributed critically** to the **longest
period**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of **great-power peace** in]{.mark}
modern [history, and **the incidence of war** and conquest]{.mark}
**more broadly** [have dropped **dramatically**]{.mark}. The number of
**democracies** in]{.underline} the world [has
**increased**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} perhaps [a
dozen]{.underline} during World War II to well over 100 today;
**[respect for basic]{.underline}** [human rights has]{.underline} also
[reached **impressive levels**]{.underline}. [As [a **bevy of
scholarship**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has shown]{.mark}, the
policies]{.underline} that the [U.S. has **pursued** and [the
**international order**]{.mark}]{.underline} it has built [[have
contributed]{.mark} **enormously**]{.underline} [and
**[directly]{.mark}** to these **outcomes**. If the **liberal
international order** can't be considered a **smashing success**, no
**international order** could be]{.underline}. The second critique is
also overstated. It is true that Washington, like all great powers
throughout history, has been willing to bend the rules to get its way.
It is hard to reconcile Cold War-era interventions in Guatemala, Chile
and other countries with a professed solicitude for human rights and
democracy; the Iraq War of 2003 is only one instance in which the U.S.
brushed aside the concerns of international organizations such as the
U.N. Security Council. Likewise, when the U.S. government determined
that the Bretton Woods system of monetary relations no longer suited its
interests in the 1970s, it terminated that scheme and insisted on
creating a more favorable one. But again, the proper standard here is
not sainthood but reality. And [the U.S. has **generally**]{.underline}
[enlisted its power in the **service** of **universal
values**]{.underline} [such as **democracy** and **human rights**; it
has, more often than not, promoted **a positive-sum** international
system in which **like-minded** nations can be **secure** and
**wealthy**.]{.underline} This goes back to the very beginning of the
liberal order: Washington did not seek to hold its defeated adversaries
in subjugation after World War II; it rebuilt Japan and western Germany
into thriving, democratic allies that became fierce economic competitors
to the U.S. The U.S. has taken this approach not simply because it
wanted to do good in the world --- powerful as this motivation is ---
but because of a hard-headed desire to do good for itself. In an
interdependent global environment, American officials have long
calculated, the U.S. cannot divorce its own well-being from that of the
wider world. And in contrast to how other great powers --- Imperial
Japan, for instance, or the Soviet Union --- ruled their spheres of
influence, American behavior has been positively enlightened. It is this
relatively benign behavior that has convinced so many countries to
tolerate American leadership --- and it is the emergence of a darker
form of U.S. hegemony under the Trump administration that so profoundly
worries them today. As for the third critique, the premise is right, but
[the **conclusion** can easily **go too far**. It is always
**dangerous** to become **so enraptured**]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
past **[achievements]{.underline}** [that one **loses sight** of the
**need for adaptation** in **the future**.]{.underline} This is
particularly true today, because the strength of the liberal order is
being tested from within and without, by issues ranging from unequal
burden-sharing among American allies to the ambivalence of the American
people themselves. [There is **[little ev]{.mark}idence** []{.mark}to
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [tha]{.underline}t either
American power or [**[the]{.mark} liberal [order]{.mark}** it supports
[have **eroded** so **dramatically**]{.mark} that
**[Washington]{.mark}**]{.underline}'s postwar project [[cannot be
**sustained**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Quite the contrary --- [[the U.S.
is]{.mark} likely [to remain the]{.mark} **world's [strongest
power]{.mark}** [for **decades to come**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### At: Arctic Key To Heg

#### The Arctic is not key to heg- resources are inaccessible, threats are defensive in nature, and military involvement generates a security dilemma that detracts focus from other regions

Matthew **Hickey in 2019**

Associate Director for Strategic Engagement and leads the Strategic
Engagement Division at the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security
Studies; The Arctic Is Not All It's Cracked Up To Be; Georgetown
Security Review;
<https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/11/18/the-arctic-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/>

All this chatter is for good reason. As the narrative goes, 30% of the
world's natural gas, and 13% of its oil lay dormant in the
Arctic.\[iii\] Countless quantities of rare earth minerals such as
Scandium and Uranium await extraction. Abundant fisheries are fodder for
commercial fishing operations, and shorter shipping routes offer
significant cost savings. But, for all this discussion there sure isn't
much action. Why? Because [the Arctic is not all it's cracked up to
be]{.underline}. Here, I present three myths about the Arctic. I assert
[the Arctic will remain]{.underline} much of what it is now -- cold,
dark, [unprofitable]{.underline}, **[and geostrategically
insignificant]{.underline}**. I argue [hydrocarbons]{.underline} [cannot
be extracted profitably]{.underline}, [shorter shipping routes do not
save money,]{.underline} **[and countries cannot effectively project
national power]{.underline}**. Myth 1: Countries can profit from the
Arctic's hydrocarbons Hydrocarbon extraction is market driven. Today,
[the costs outweigh the benefits and supply far exceeds
demand]{.underline}. **[Neither will change]{.underline}**. In 2014,
Royal Dutch [Shell]{.underline}, arguably one of the world's most
successful and sophisticated energy companies, began expanding its
Arctic operations into the Beaufort Sea. It [invested \$7B
into]{.underline} its ambitious [Arctic drilling]{.underline} project.
The results were, in Shell's words, "disappointing."\[iv\] [The costs
were high, the results were poor]{.underline}, and controversy was
damning. Shell's efforts far exceeded benefits. It needed to find "a
lot" of oil to make return on its massive investment, but it's state of
the art Polar Pioneer Arctic drilling rig failed to find very much of
it. And, adding to its struggle, despite its responsible practices and
adherence to U.S. and international law, Shell was still met with great
criticism. Environmental activists painted Shell's operations as
villainous and its failure as a cause for celebration. Some oil analysts
believe [Shell was]{.underline} actually [relieved to pull out of the
Arctic]{.underline}.\[v\] Shell is not alone. [Exxon-Mobile
failed]{.underline} in Russia. In 2018 Exxon withdrew its Arctic
ventures because of European and U.S. sanctions against Russia that
prevented it from doing business.\[vi\] After twice failing to obtain
waivers, even with former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson serving as Secretary
of State, Exxon continued its Russia operations. As a result, it was
fined \$2M by the U.S. Treasury Department and even worse for Exxon, it
eventually closed its Russia operations at the cost of \$200M.\[vii\]
But high cost is just one reason Arctic operations are failing. Low
demand is another. The International Energy Administration estimates
that oil prices must hover around \$100/barrel for Arctic oil operations
to profit.\[viii\] Today, the price is half that and unlikely to rise
that high anytime soon, especially while fracking continues unabated.
Globally, oil demand is also decreasing as energy companies and
consumers turn towards renewables. Indeed, even Saudi Arabia and Norway
are divesting their sovereign wealth funds from hydrocarbons and
shifting into renewables. [Russia]{.underline}, however, [has a greater
demand for Arctic oil and gas than the rest of the world.]{.underline}
It relies exclusively on Arctic hydrocarbons to feed its energy needs
and supplies much of Europe. But many of its Arctic projects are
stagnating. The Prirazlomnaya oil platform had very little success in
the Barents Sea, and Gazprom recently ended its efforts in the Shtokman
field. When asked why these projects fail, a Russian geologist, speaking
anonymously, said, "[Russia lacks the tech]{.underline}nology."\[ix\]
So, despite Russia's desire and necessity to increase its Arctic
operations it lacks the ability [to realize its potential.]{.underline}
Myth 2: Shorter Arctic routes are cheaper [A shorter route does not mean
a cheaper route]{.underline}. Arctic shipping routes could save a great
deal of time and money for companies currently using the Panama and Suez
canals for transit between Asia and the United States, or Asia and
Europe.\[x\] But, [the costs saved on transit time is lost on overcoming
significant challenges.]{.underline} The Northern Sea Route (NSR) along
Russia's Arctic Coast is transitable for only three months. It may be
open longer as the ice cap furthers its retreat, but [a receding ice cap
does not mean no ice cap.]{.underline} Winter and Spring will always
present difficulties. Even in the best of times, the NSR is still
incredibly dangerous. [The waters are largely uncharted]{.underline},
each season is different, [and]{.underline} the [weather]{.underline} is
always [unpredictable]{.underline}. Search and rescue assets are far
away, and experienced ship captains are lacking. [It will be
decades]{.underline} [before]{.underline} large [cargo]{.underline}
ships that [could link]{.underline} China and northern Europe [through
the Arctic]{.underline} Ocean can reliably make the journey.\[xi\] Until
all these challenges are overcome, it remains cheaper to take other
established and reliable routes. Myth 3: Controlling the Arctic is
strategically important If the Arctic is not profitable, then perhaps it
is still strategically valuable. Many defense officials cite Russia's
military build-up as a sign the Arctic is an emerging battleground or
perhaps a place of great military stand-off.\[xii\] Russia is occupying
Cold War bases and is amassing an enormous Arctic force. It floated a
nuclear power plant across Arctic waters and planted a titanium flag
beneath the North Pole. But despite this, **[the sentiment is now
changing regarding the strategic value of the Arctic]{.underline}**. As
recently as April 2019, [the Navy]{.underline}'s new Arctic strategic
outlook [perceives the Arctic to be at "low risk for
conflict]{.underline}."\[xiii\] For now, Russia is all bark, and no
bite.\[xiv\] This is largely [because Russia's military activity is
defensive]{.underline} in nature. Russia's foreign minister has stated,
"We don't threaten anyone. We ensure sufficient defense capabilities
given the political and military situation around our borders."\[xv\] Of
course, Sergey Lavrov's comments have been met with skepticism, but
there is reason to believe him. Studies by the Arctic Institute suggest
[Russia is motivated by the potential gains achievable through
cooperation]{.underline} like shared search and rescue and route
charting.\[xvi\] And finally, on a practical note, **[there is nothing
to fight for in the Arctic]{.underline}**. [All land disputes are
resolved or irrelevant]{.underline} (the Hans Island dispute, for
example) and most Exclusive Economic Zone disputes are resolved.
Securitizing the Arctic would destabilize it. **[If U.S. and NATO forces
begin aggressively patrolling the Arctic, it justifies Russia's
actions]{.underline}**. **[Military posturing increases chances for
miscalculation]{.underline}**. As Robert Huebert, professor of Strategic
Studies at the University of Calgary and acclaimed Arctic expert, sees
it, [an Arctic security dilemma is on the horizon]{.underline} if not
already here.\[xvii\] Frankly, if Russia wants to patrol the Arctic and
expend its resources in a futile, frozen ocean then let it. [America has
what it needs. If it is needed in the Arctic, the U.S. will
go]{.underline}. **[For now]{.underline}**, **[it is needed
elsewhere]{.underline}**, and if Russian efforts are depleted in those
places because of its Arctic front, all the better. [The Arctic hype is
wrong]{.underline}. [The region is]{.underline} not all it's cracked up
to be: It's [not profitable]{.underline}, it's [not safe]{.underline} to
transit, it's [not a reliable place to operate.]{.underline} It is cold,
dark, and irrelevant. Don't believe anyone that thinks otherwise.

[Competition with China in the Arctic region]{.underline} therefore

important streams of effort in the short term, while China's military
presence is largely prospective. [These observations frame the
relationship between the Arctic and Indo-Pacific regions]{.underline}.
Further, they provide a basis for developing strategic assumptions and
recommendations for the future. [Placing the Arctic and Indo-Pacific
into a strategic hierarchy of US-Chinese competition in which **the
Indo-Pacific is primary and the Arctic is secondary** helps clarify
policy choices]{.underline}. For example, one strategic conclusion might
be that [low-cost]{.underline} diplomatic, intelligence, and economic
[efforts should be centered in the Arctic]{.underline}, **[so that
high-cost military efforts can be focused on the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**; that these efforts should increase US
influence and block the growth of Chinese influence in the Arctic.38
[Given]{.underline} the [primary focus on the Indo-Pacific and the need
for expensive, high-end military capabilities]{.underline}---as well as
other spending on competitive domains, such as science and technology,
and space, as identified in the Innovation and Competition Act,
described above---[an approach to the Arctic that centers on
diplomacy]{.underline}, intelligence, and economic development also
[may]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [fiscally]{.underline}
[achievable]{.underline}. In the future, should China develop Arctic
military capabilities, up to and including polar-capable ballistic
missile submarines, this strategic calculus may evolve. However, [the
United States' focus on China as the primary rival, and the Indo-Pacific
as the primary theater]{.underline} of confrontation, **[appears to be
enduring]{.underline}**. [Assessments of Arctic strategy should bear in
mind that it is **not the primary competitive theater** between the US
and China]{.underline} and further that the Arctic should be prevented
from becoming a more competitive theater if at all possible.

### At: Indo-Pacific Heg Fails

#### Indo-pacific heg doesn't solve stability and no risk of conflict if we withdrawal

[China's determination to reunify with Taiwan and the Philippines'
desire to favorably resolve disputes]{.underline} in the South China Sea
[indicate U.S. dominance of the Indo-Pacific region is doing little to
preserve]{.underline} peace and [stability]{.underline}. While
Washington focuses on bolstering its military spending and presence to
maintain regional dominance, Chinese President Xi Jinping is achieving
diplomatic victories with Vietnam, South Korea, Japan and Bhutan that
ultimately advance Chinese interests. **[More U.S. hard power in the
region will not reverse Beijing's course]{.underline}**.
[Maintaining]{.underline} regional [hegemony in Asia isn't worth the
cost.]{.underline} Tens of [billions]{.underline} of dollars from the
\$875 billion National Defense Authorization Act [is slated to support
U.S. dominance in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, [adding to
the]{.underline} nearly \$34 trillion [national debt]{.underline}. The
debt is projected to grow to over \$45 trillion by 2027, with government
interest payments on the debt expected to be around \$3 trillion per
year. This is almost the same amount spent on Social Security, Medicare
and Medicaid. With "higher for longer" interest rates the global norm,
the economic growth needed to sustain interest payments is not
guaranteed. [A U.S. debt crisis is a greater threat to the nation than
America losing its dominance]{.underline} [in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. If debt servicing continues to increase its
share of the federal budget, [Washington will likely be forced to make a
catastrophic choice between significantly weakening essential government
spending or defaulting on the debt]{.underline}. [Both would have
drastic consequences for U.S. national security]{.underline} and
economic prosperity. China is already reducing its exposure to U.S.
debt, in part to reduce sovereign risk. A U.S. economic meltdown would
severely weaken American power. [Even without a hegemonic policy in
Asia, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline}
likely [maintain its economic benefit]{.underline} --- and [at a lower
cost]{.underline}. A prominent argument for preserving U.S. leadership
in the Indo-Pacific is because it provides an economic advantage.
However, [as reshoring]{.underline} and nearshoring
[accelerate]{.underline}, [Asia will become less important to U.S.
economic prosperity]{.underline}. [Moreover]{.underline}, the [trade
rules]{.underline} governing the Comprehensive and Progressive
Trans-Pacific Partnership and, yes, even the Chinese-led Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership [are based on Washington's
policies]{.underline}. [These rules]{.underline}, [which will become
more difficult to change]{.underline} as more countries join the trade
pacts, [will influence regional economics and trade for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}

#### Indo-Pacific heg is unsustainable because of naval limitations to power projection and geographic diversity

Setting economic factors aside, **[U.S. dominance in Asia is
unsustainable]{.underline}**. [Historically, dominance doesn't
last]{.underline}. Even more so [for maritime empires]{.underline} ---
see the fall of the 20th century colonial empires. Even China, India and
Japan could not sustain their regional hegemonies. [China and India's
resurgence]{.underline} as great powers further [challenges America's
ability to remain the dominant power in Asia]{.underline}.
[Both]{.underline} China and India [seek to restore]{.underline} their
historical greatness and [influence]{.underline} [in]{.underline} East
and South [Asia]{.underline}. They want to protect and advance their
respective national interests. Beijing and New Delhi already pursue
independent foreign policies, despite those who believe India could
become a U.S.-aligned ally. Differences with China aside, [India's
devotion to national unity]{.underline}, to the extent that it is
willing to assassinate or attempt to kill separatist leaders in Canada
and the United States, [shows that a powerful India will demand a
greater say in Asia]{.underline}. [Geographically, total dominance of
Asia]{.underline} --- from Japan to India --- **[is a pipe
dream]{.underline}**, especially **[for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [Logistically, U.S. power projection will be
limited by the Pacific Ocean and U.S. allies' willingness to support
shows of force.]{.underline} U.S. [leadership on the continent itself is
effectively **impossible** considering the **lack of serious land power
presence**]{.underline}. But this is the same for the Asian great
powers. [The Pacific and Indian Oceans will restrict China, India and
even Japan's ability to dominate]{.underline} the region. Moreover,
[India and China must grapple with diverse geographies]{.underline} ---
such as the Himalayas, the Gobi Desert, and the jungles of Southeast
Asia --- [and distances of thousands of miles, which will limit their
abilities to lead the region.]{.underline}

### At: Indo-Pacific Dominance Impossible

#### US doesn't need to dominate the region- balancing China solves

https://www.hudson.org/defense-strategy/balance-indo-pacific-defining-us-approach-alex-wong

[We do not need dominance---China does]{.underline}.
[China's]{.underline} communist [ideology]{.underline}, its increasingly
nationalist political culture, its state-directed economic push to
advantage Chinese firms, [and]{.underline} its military [goal of denying
U.S. forces access]{.underline} to the region---all of these [demand
dominance]{.underline} [and]{.underline} demand [that]{.underline}
Indo-Pacific **[countries actively choose China]{.underline}**. (And in
some instances, such as with territorial waters, countries are not even
choosing. China is simply taking.) While [this approach]{.underline} may
have the frisson of strength, it [is]{.underline} in fact [a liability
for China]{.underline}'s strategy. Dominance is exceedingly difficult to
achieve. [That puts the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [at an
advantage]{.underline}. Unlike a push for dominance, [our push for
balance dovetails with the interests]{.underline} and strategic cultures
[of the majority of Indo-Pacific countries]{.underline}. Well before the
United States was even a country, [the geopolitical leitmotif of the
Indo-Pacific was its various nations seeking power equilibria with
China]{.underline}. That was easier during a century when China was
weaker and its external ambitions in remission. [That is harder now that
China has risen]{.underline}. [So there is natural]{.underline}---almost
eternal---[space here for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[to anchor itself as a balancer]{.underline} in the individual
strategies of each country of the Indo-Pacific. [If we achieve enough
balance]{.underline} to ensure that partners can make sovereign
decisions free from coercion in terms of trade, security, and
international politics, [we are winning]{.underline}. [That balance
enables us to collectively constrain China]{.underline}'s more
aggressive behaviors [and maintain U.S. access to the
region.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is challenged by a new
multipolar reality whereby most non-aligned countries will opt to hedge
against both China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[while the revisionist coalition cooperates increasingly closely. The
multipolar world is already in action]{.underline}: North Korean forces
are now on the ground in Ukraine, fighting on behalf of Russia,1 while
Iran continues to upend order in the Middle East as it simultaneously
supports Moscow. [Looming above]{.underline} these threats [stands
the]{.underline} People's Republic of China ([PRC) as the most powerful
member of this coalition, with a growing risk of kinetic
conflict]{.underline} over Taiwan or other regional flashpoints. [Yet,

the vastness of US military structure and extended commitments further

[While]{.underline} previous [administrations]{.underline} [have
promised to shift the focus to the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, **[our
efforts were insufficient to achieve US objectives]{.underline}** **[and
have left the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[losing
ground to China in this critical region]{.underline}**. Not only did US
efforts to sway China into becoming a "responsible stakeholder"
ultimately fail, but [the gap]{.underline} between China and the United
States [across military, economic, and political power has actually
narrowed]{.underline} even further over the past decade. Looking out
across the region, [the PRC has become an economic gravity well pulling
in the wider region]{.underline} and a looming potential hegemon more
than willing to wield the coercive tools at its disposal. China's
diffidence towards a rules-based order championed by the advanced
economies has become all too clear. [The economic picture remains poor
for the United States' influence in the region]{.underline}. Over the
last two decades, [China has replaced the United States as the largest
trading partner for most countries]{.underline} globally and [in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.6 [Beijing has also emerged as a leader across
many]{.underline} of the [key technologies]{.underline} of tomorrow,
including artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and robotics.7
Although the United States and key allies like Japan have moved to
stymie China's attempts to seize the lead with export controls of
dual-use technologies, Beijing remains a nimble and innovative
competitor with the potential to bypass or mitigate these efforts.8
COVID-19 exposed real strains in the international supply chain, and
China's economic coercion over the past decade highlights the serious
risks run by too much dependence upon Beijing for strategic imports.9
"China Plus One" and other initiatives to reduce or "de-risk" from China
are underway but will take time, and they run the risk of damaging US
growth and innovation.10 While efforts to boost American manufacturing
and address inequalities in the global economy are vital for economic
security and prosperity, protectionist efforts must be balanced with the
need to cultivate strong relationships with key allies and partners and
avoid unintentionally hampering US prosperity. [Relative US hard power
is also not what it once was.]{.underline} Although the United States
military remains the most capable in the world, [the PRC can concentrate
its forces in the Western Pacific, while the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must protect interests and project power
throughout the globe]{.underline}. With Russia making gains in Ukraine
and the Iranian "Axis of Resistance" challenging security in the Middle
East, as well as instability throughout key parts of the Global South,
[the risk of overstretch is real]{.underline}. [Supplying Ukraine and
Israel with key weapons systems]{.underline} and ammunition [has
exhausted American stockpiles]{.underline}, such as the 155mm artillery
shells and air-defense missiles necessary for contemporary peer-to-peer
combat. [Production capacity remains inadequate]{.underline}.11 Making
matters worse, North Korea's increasingly threatening posture across the
DMZ can be added to the list of Indo-Pacific flashpoints, including the
South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait. This is an era where
[increases to the defense budget may not be enough]{.underline} to
counter all threats simultaneously.

### Turn- Arctic Key 2 Indo-Pacific

#### Arctic control key to Indo-Pacific- air power, missile defense, and logistics

Senator Dan **Sullivan in 2024**

Strategic Importance for the Indo-Pacific; Hudson Institute; event

But [we need to do a lot more because this is going to continue in
Alaska]{.underline} in America, by the way, and we need to be ready. And
of course, historically we know that our adversaries are then
adversaries. Imperial Japan invaded and occupied the Aleutian Islands
during World War II. So sometimes what the policymakers in DC don't
understand or don't follow the rest of the world is following. So again,
the title here, and Ken thank you very much, is talking about [Alaska's
strategic importance to Indo-Pacom]{.underline} and really the world. I
want to provide [three areas where we]{.underline} do [have]{.underline}
very, very much [strategic importance for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Touch on each of these and again, welcome the Q&A.
[The first is our huge military importance because of our strategic
location]{.underline}. If you want to go to the next slide. I like to
say that [Alaska constitutes three pillars of America's military
might]{.underline}. [We are the cornerstone of missile
defense]{.underline} for the entire nation. By the way, I've talked to
President Trump about this. His whole concept that we are working on
with him right now of an iron dome for America, well, a lot of that's
going to be based in Alaska, simply because of where we are
strategically. In terms of missile defense, [all the ground-based
missile interceptors protecting our country are in Alaska with the
exception of four]{.underline} that are at Vandenberg Air Force Base.
[All the major radar systems]{.underline} that protect the entire United
States, whether it's New York City, Miami, Chicago,
they['re]{.underline} [all based in Alaska]{.underline}. So that is a
key component of who we are, what we provide in terms of military
importance to our country. [The second area]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} we are **[the hub of air combat power for the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}** and the Arctic. One example is [we
have over a hundred fifth-generation fighters now headquartered in
Alaska]{.underline}. That's F-35s and F-22s, supersonic stealth
fighters. There's no place in the world that has that fifth-generation
combat power. Those are owned by Admiral Paparo you see there in terms
of who has operational control of those. And [that is a huge
asset]{.underline} for the United States [in the Indo-Pacific
region.]{.underline} And finally, [we are a strategic platform because
we're so close to everything]{.underline} for expeditionary forces [that
can launch from Alaska with our airlift assets to anywhere in the world
in the Northern Hemisphere within six to seven hours]{.underline}. The
Army a couple years ago understood this and they stood up the 11th
Airborne Division. So the Army now has two airborne divisions. Again, it
does make a lot of press. They got the 82nd down in lower 48, they got
the 11th Airborne Division based in Alaska. [That is a airborne unit
ready to go at a moment's notice, and it can get anywhere, anywhere very
quickly. It's a great Arctic train unit.]{.underline}

### Turn- Arctic Stops China Revisionism

#### Arctic presence bolsters deterrence of China in the Indo-Pacific- keeps them from a global revisionist project and cuts off access to key resources

[The U]{.underline}nited [St]{.underline}ates publication of the 2024
Arctic Strategy provides a transparent approach aimed at reducing the
possibility of escalation in the Arctic. Moreover, the current [strategy
recognizes]{.underline} Russia's and [China's Arctic
ambitions]{.underline} and that the growing collaboration between Russia
and the PRC have "the potential to alter the Arctic's stability and
threat picture."36) The strategy presents a tangible and realistic way
forward for the U.S. to enhance the Joint Force's Arctic capabilities,
engage with Allies and partners, and demonstrate an ability to work
together across defense forces. Although [the strategy]{.underline}
indicates increased U.S. involvement in the Arctic, it [remains
reactive]{.underline}. The 2024 Arctic Strategy already outlines a
tangible way for the United States to commit energy and resources to the
region. Although a deliberate shift in messaging will not change the
U.S. footprint in the Arctic, it will change the U.S. mindset towards
the region. [By making the Arctic a priority, the U.S. demonstrates its
commitment to supporting its Allies in the event that Russia or China
attacks]{.underline}. Furthermore, [by shifting to a proactive Arctic
Strategy]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[is not abandoning its focus on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**,
**[because the PRC envisions itself as a polar power and intends to
reshape the international system in its favor]{.underline}**. [Future
conflict with the PRC will not be geographically constrained to the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} [By shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy
now, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[can deter China
from expanding its control over the Arctic and its critical
resources.]{.underline}** [The future battlefield is melting and only by
taking actions today can the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
and its NATO allies [win tomorrow's war in the Arctic]{.underline}.

#### Arctic control is key to preventing China's global rise- it breaks their hold on rare mineral access and contains their ability to expand beyond the Indo-Pacific

of the U.S. Embassy, Oslo. She is a Norwegian speaker and holds a Master

Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy; The Arctic Institute;
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/future-battlefield-melting-argument-us-must-adopt-more-proactive-arctic-strategy/>

[The Arctic is **insufficiently prioritized**]{.underline} [amidst the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [competing global
interests]{.underline}. The future battlefield is melting and demands US
attention, as a partnership between Russia and the People's Republic of
China fuels strategic competition in the Arctic. Thus, the United States
must adopt a proactive Arctic strategy, working with its NATO Allies to
ensure that the Arctic remains stable and free from conflict. The US's
2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United States
"seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."1) To achieve a secure
Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy, produced by the U.S. Department of
Defense, follows a "monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this
reactive strategy is inadequate.2) Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine
provides evidence that Moscow will not adhere to the current global
order and will continue to challenge Western international norms
wherever possible, including in the Arctic. NATO's growing appeal among
European states suggests that NATO may also be called upon to guarantee
the future of Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating
Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic
NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden,
has expanded,, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO
members. The alliance offers an opportunity for the United States to
strengthen its position in the Arctic region while not having to go it
alone. [The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently
counters]{.underline} Russian [and Chinese strategic]{.underline} Arctic
[ambitions]{.underline}, though the makings of a more effective Arctic
Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024 Arctic Strategy.
[Washington must]{.underline} build on this foundation,
[shift]{.underline}ing [its mindset towards the Arctic]{.underline}. A
proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in which the United States and its
NATO partners are not afraid to define the rules and laws governing the
north. [Critics]{.underline} of this approach [will claim]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} taking [a more assertive position in the Arctic
will]{.underline} further antagonize Russia and [divert important
resources from the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region and China. **[This
is simply not the case]{.underline}**. Russia and [China have already
taken steps to claim and militarize the Arctic]{.underline}. [By acting
now, the US]{.underline} and its NATO allies [will be better positioned
to counter the threat posed by]{.underline} Russia and **[China in the
Arctic and beyond]{.underline}**. Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost
in the Arctic Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in
the region among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as China.
[Melting sea ice]{.underline} from rising global temperatures [has
created new military]{.underline} and economic [opportunities in the
region.]{.underline} Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed four times faster
than the rest of the world, according to an August 2022 scientific study
published in Nature.3) As ice rapidly melts in the Arctic, [increased
access to critical rare earth elements]{.underline}, such as platinum,
copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel [emerge]{.underline}. Moreover,
[melting ice is opening more easily traversed Arctic waters, which has
led to a surge of]{.underline} both [military]{.underline} and
commercial ship [activity]{.underline} in the region. These two
developments have increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.
[Any nation that can effectively mine]{.underline}, process, and refine
the **[materials will have a strategic advantage]{.underline}**. [These
minerals are required for developing tech]{.underline}nologies [ranging
from renewable energy]{.underline} systems [to electronics used for
national defense]{.underline}. According to the World Bank, [the demand
to produce minerals]{.underline}, many of which are [found in the
Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050]{.underline} to
meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.4[) China already
dominates the global supply chain]{.underline} for critical materials.
The United States depends on these materials for its economic
competitiveness and national defense.5) As ice melts, new routes are
emerging that are more navigable. This has resulted in more ship
activity in the region. For instance, the Arctic Council Working Group
on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment reports that there
has been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in
the Arctic over the past ten years.6) While much of this activity is
commercial, Russia and China have also taken advantage of the new sea
routes to project their naval power. They have carried out numerous
regional deployments and patrols, demonstrating their ability to execute
military operations in the austere Arctic climate.7) The expanded
presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the region poses a growing
threat to NATO member states. In October 2023, Finnish investigators
suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor
over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one
pipeline. While the international community has not assigned blame
wholly to China, China later admitted to accidentally destroying an
important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea
in 2024. These examples suggest that incidents of this nature could
become more likely as military activity increases in the region.8)
Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions
[The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early warning
signs that the region could become a site of future
conflict]{.underline}. In 2021 Russia and China renewed their
20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, a move described as "an act of friendship against
America."9) Moreover, both Russia and China have deep historic and
economic ties to the Arctic. NATO's expansion to include Finland and
Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while both Russia and
China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in
the Arctic.10) However, despite feeling antagonized by NATO's actions,
Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and military capacities to
reshape the current international rules-based order in the Arctic in the
near term. Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia
controls over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive
player in the future of the region.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions
are not new. Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to
the sixteenth century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was
part of a larger initiative to search for resources and trade routes.12)
As the nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. During the Cold
War, the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the
Kola Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With the collapse of
the Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic power. As the
Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir Putin,
Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.14) According to Colin
Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the Arctic is heavily
weighted towards Russia." Furthermore, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the Arctic
Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.15) Russia's remilitarization
of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership with China,
provides both countries with the means to challenge the current Western
rules-based international order. Although China's Arctic history does
not mirror Russia's centuries-old presence in the north[, Beijing's
desire for Arctic supremacy has rapidly evolved]{.underline} over the
past century. China's involvement in the Arctic began in 1925 with the
signing of the Svalbard Treaty, providing a legal basis for China to
conduct non-military activity, such as scientific exploration, resource
extraction, and fishing in the Arctic.16) However, China's rationale to
operate in the region extends beyond scientific exploration. In 2018
China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that it is a
"Near-Arctic State."17) China employs a dual narrative to explain its
aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign audiences by
advocating for the safeguarding of international interests and promoting
sustainable Arctic development. However, this is juxtaposed against the
narrative it promotes for domestic audiences, which emphasizes
competition for resources and China's desire to become a "polar great
power."18) The Svalbard Treaty has currently enabled China to shroud its
military activity and influence in the Arctic as scientific exploration
and global cooperation. But [it is becoming clear from its]{.underline}
growing partnership with Russia and increasingly [aggressive military
action in the Arctic that China's intentions to reshape the
international system **extend well beyond the
Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}. The U.S. and NATO would be wise to
recognize China's aims in the Arctic. The historic ties of Russia and
China and their Arctic ambitions reveal that [the Arctic is likely to be
an arena for future strategic competition]{.underline}. Russia's 2022
invasion of Ukraine has temporarily bolstered the West's position in the
Arctic, as previously neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's
accession into NATO not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by
over 650 percent and moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from
St. Petersburg, but it also contributed to creating a divided Arctic,
where nearly half belongs to NATO while the remaining half is Russian
territory.

[The Arctic has remained a remarkable haven of cooperation and
stability]{.underline}. Simply [because it is becoming easier to
increase military buildup in the region does not mean it is necessary or
beneficial for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to do
so.]{.underline} To be sure, [there are areas in which Washington needs
to increase its Arctic investments, such as its]{.underline} badly
neglected [icebreaker fleet, infrastructure]{.underline}, and search and
rescue on Alaska's northern coast, [and]{.underline} increased Coast
Guard [patrols]{.underline} of its exclusive economic zone as the

### Indo-Pacific Focus Bad- Miscalc

#### Indo-Pacific focus causes arms racing with China that escalates to miscalc and nuclear use

For American foreign policy practitioners, these policies may seem like
an anchor of stability in a turbulent geopolitical sea. However, [policy
continuity risks ignoring the ways in which the region]{.underline}
itself [is changing]{.underline}. [It is important]{.underline},
therefore, [to consider]{.underline} the [negative externalities these
policies help generate]{.underline}, [which contribute to]{.underline}
growing [instability and escalation risks]{.underline} over the long
run. If ignored, **[these accumulating risks could lead to catastrophic
deterrence failures.]{.underline}** First, [defining Taiwan as the
worst-case-stress test for US military planning has over time increased
arms racing pressures and exacerbated crisis instability]{.underline}.
Since China cannot match the US "ship for ship, tank for tank," [Beijing
focuses on investing in capabilities that target US
weaknesses]{.underline}, predominantly in anti-access/area denial
(A2AD). [To maintain deterrence based on military superiority feeds a
perception in Washington that it must continually increase arms
production]{.underline} to overcome the growth in Chinese capabilities.
At the same time, [the centrality of the Taiwan scenario]{.underline} to
US military planning---coupled with arms sales to Taipei and rhetorical
support perceived by Beijing as advancing Taiwanese
independence---[drives more]{.underline} bellicose and [aggressive
Chinese behavior]{.underline}. This further reinforces US perceptions
that deterrence is failing and needs to be re-established via augmented
forces and greater support for Taiwan. [This vicious cycle is already
highly escalatory on its own, but attempting to deny China area
superiority around Taiwan also requires US military planners to target
multiple locations in the Chinese mainland,]{.underline} where most of
Beijing's anti-access/area denial capabilities are based. Even if the US
would not strike these capabilities directly to avoid escalation in a
conflict, military planners might nevertheless be prompted to target
Chinese dual-use command, control, communication, and intelligence
assets as a way to blunt China's A2AD. [Given the probable entanglement
of these systems with China's nuclear arsenal, this strategy carries
substantial risks of inadvertent nuclear escalation]{.underline}, over
and above the costs of arms racing. Second, [worst-case
planning]{.underline} by both Washington and Beijing [is part of another
spiral driving increased prominence of nuclear deterrence in the
region]{.underline}. [China is currently engaged in a substantial
build-up of its nuclear arsenal, seemingly motivated by concerns
about]{.underline} the [survivability]{.underline} of its nuclear
second-strike capability against the combination of US missile defenses
and precision conventional strike arms. [China's fears are exacerbated
by Washington's reluctance to acknowledge mutual nuclear
vulnerability]{.underline}---a strategic reassurance that the US does
not seek to undermine China's nuclear deterrent. [This is another
feature of US policy continuity]{.underline}, partly due to domestic
politics (not wanting to be branded as "weak" on China), and partly due
to allies' concerns that acknowledging mutual vulnerability could
attenuate US extended deterrence. [The]{.underline} combination of
[growing nuclear threats from China]{.underline} (and North Korea)
[compounds the stress on US extended deterrence
commitments]{.underline}, driving South Korea and Japan to seek more and
more visible US nuclear capability in the region. In turn, [efforts by
the United States and its allies to continually "strengthen" deterrence
drive arms race perceptions in Beijing]{.underline} and Pyongyang.

In reality, whether there is a single "global order" keyed to the
interests and values of the United States, and whether both Russia and
China are committed to overturning this entire order as a vital
necessity are highly debatable propositions.110 But putting that issue
aside, [[there is little]{.mark} if any [hard evidence to confirm that
China has set the goal of replacing the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[as the dominant global
superpower]{.underline}]{.mark} (and in the process replacing all major
global norms) as a vital necessity. [[It is not even clear that Beijing
seeks regional preeminence, as opposed to]{.mark} some form of
**[parity]{.mark}** [with the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and Japan, at least as measured by numbers
of naval and air platforms. It is worth noting that [[Chinese leaders
routinely state they are not developing their military to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} such global or regional
[[dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, there is nothing in the
authoritative Chinese record to confirm such a goal.111 Based on
authoritative statements, the Chinese identify five major global
missions for the PLA: • The defense of China's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) in the Persian Gulf, • Countering limited maritime
security threats such as piracy. • United Nations-mandated peacekeeping
missions. • Performing humanitarian assistance/disaster relief missions
and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations. • Asserting (in undefined ways)
China's overall influence, status, and image as a major world power.112
In addition (and of greater importance), according to a recent, detailed
study of China's military strategy, Beijing continues to face major,
deep-seated strategic, structural, and resource constraints in
developing a truly globe-spanning military doctrine and posture.
Instead, its military strategy remains fixed primarily on Taiwan and
other so-called local wars and "is not expected to address more than a
single major contingency."113 Of course, the ambiguity of the last
bullet point leaves open the possibility that China seeks global
military preeminence. But according to many U.S. sources, including the
Defense Department, this goal is more than just a possibility. DoD
reports have clearly indicated in places that Beijing not only would
never accept a position of military inferiority vis-à-vis the United
States, but desires to achieve clear preeminence. And yet, the DoD has
also at times seemed to equivocate somewhat regarding this assessment.
In the 2021 DoD report, for example, China's goal of national
rejuvenation is linked with an effort to "match or surpass" (emphasis
added) U.S. global influence and power." The same report also stated
that, despite its desire to create a "world-class military," the Chinese
leadership does not necessarily "aim for the PLA to mirror the U.S.
military in terms of capacity, capability, or readiness."114 Some
observers might think that there is no practical difference between
China's seeking to match rather than exceed U.S. military capabilities
as a vital interest, but this is not the case. [[Efforts to match a
potential foe's capabilities suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} a possible
[[willingness to achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} some type of **[[stable
balance]{.underline}]{.mark}** or set of understandings in which neither
side strives, as a vital national interest, to dominate the other.
