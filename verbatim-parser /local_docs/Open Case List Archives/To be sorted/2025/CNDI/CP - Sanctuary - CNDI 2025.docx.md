The Arctic sea ice is melting. [**[Climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline} resulting from human activity has
[[removed]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [[75% of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the summer sea [[ice]{.mark} volume]{.underline} at rates never before
experienced in human history. Soon, the Arctic
[[Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark} will be like other oceans for much of the
year: open water that is [[exposed]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
exploitation and [**environmental [destruction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[This unique place]{.underline} is extraordinarily
**[vulnerable]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} of all the world's
oceans, it is [the least protected]{.underline}. [Less than
1.5%]{.underline} of this area has any form of [protected area
status.]{.underline} In the high seas, the global commons, there is
none. The [[Arctic is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus the [defining symbol of
**[unchecked climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Its
[[melting]{.mark} sea ice [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a miserable [[product
of human endeavour]{.mark}.]{.underline} With large parts once a de
facto marine reserve protected by permanent sea ice, the Arctic
[Ocean]{.underline} has now [become]{.underline} the crucial
[battleground in the fight for a sustainable]{.underline} future for our
planet. Arctic coastal states (Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the
US) are keen to lay claim to the valuable resources found beyond their
national boundaries, and they have all submitted applications to extend
their polar seabeds. [[Gov]{.underline}e]{.mark}rnments and industry
[[see]{.underline}]{.mark} the opening of the [[Arctic
as]{.mark}]{.underline} yet another [[**business opportunity** to
extract]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}
and fish, placing this unique [region -- and]{.underline} the entire
[[world]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[at]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[greater]{.mark} [risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark} a stark
[[choice]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can [**[exploit]{.mark}** the
resources]{.underline} of one of the world's most fragile and precious
oceans, [[or]{.mark} we can **[manage]{.mark}**]{.underline} it
[[responsibly]{.underline}]{.mark} -- both [[for]{.mark} future
gen]{.underline}erations, [and]{.underline} for northern and
[[Indigenous]{.mark} communities]{.underline} today, [whose livelihoods
rely upon a healthy ocean]{.underline}. Part of the [[solution]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} simple: the [creation of]{.mark} a sanctuary in the high
seas region around the North Pole.]{.underline} The proposed [**[Arctic
Sanctuary]{.mark}** is]{.underline} a [highly protected
area]{.underline} (or marine reserve[) [that will be off-limits
to]{.underline} ]{.mark}[all [extractive]{.mark} and destructive
[uses]{.mark}]{.underline}, covering the central Arctic Ocean beyond the
200 nautical mile limit of Arctic coastal states' exclusive economic
zones. This [[region]{.underline}]{.mark} is technically [[defined as
"high seas"]{.mark} under]{.underline} the United Nations Convention on
Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS]{.underline}), [and]{.underline} is [universally
recognized as the global commons,]{.underline} the [shared
responsibility]{.underline} of the entire international community. Such
a Sanctuary [will fulfil]{.underline} some of the [international
commitments to establish a [global **network** of]{.mark} marine
**[protected areas]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) mandated network of ["areas [where extractive
uses are excluded]{.mark}, and]{.underline} other [significant human
pressures are]{.underline} removed or [[minimized]{.mark}, to enable the
integrity, structure and [functioning of ecosystems]{.mark} to be
maintained]{.underline} or recovered" (CBD Decision VII/5 para 21 (b)).
[[Within]{.underline}]{.mark} the Arctic
[[Sanctuary]{.underline}]{.mark}, there will be [no fishing, [no]{.mark}
**[exploration]{.mark}** for or [extraction of hydrocarbons]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} other minerals from the seabed, and no [military]{.mark}
[activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Strict]{.underline} environmental
[controls]{.underline} will [apply to all shipping in this
area]{.underline}, although not all shipping activity will be prohibited
-- heavy fuel oil use will, for example, not be allowed, a practice that
is already adopted in Antarctic waters. The [proposed Arctic [Sanctuary
is]{.mark} large: [2.8 million km2]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's roughly
the size of the Mediterranean Sea, [but]{.underline} still [only a tiny
fraction of the entire Arctic Ocean]{.underline} (14 million km2). And
it is incredibly remote, lying [[beyond]{.mark} the]{.underline}
traditional [[lands]{.mark}]{.underline} and waters [[of]{.mark}
**[Indigenous Peoples']{.mark}**, yet fundamental to the survival of
their ways of living. It presents to the world]{.underline} both real
and symbolic [**values** that will otherwise be lost, with global
consequences]{.underline}.

Never before have we been able to choose how to manage vast areas of an
ocean from scratch, with the full backing of science and international
law. **[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark}** a specific
[**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} regime, this extraordinary
[**[region]{.mark}**]{.underline} is "[open for business".]{.underline}
If we do nothing, it [will]{.underline} become yet another **[[victim
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** our rapacious **[[appetite for
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps even [**[raising tensions
between]{.mark} those [countries seeking to exploit]{.mark}**
them.]{.underline} Fishing is but one example of the need for better
rules. The high seas area is currently not subject to any regulations to
control fishing. In 2012, more than 1 million km2 of previously
ice-covered area in the Arctic Ocean (larger than the Norwegian Sea)
with fishable water depths became open water as the sea ice melted.
Primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean is now thought to be much
higher than previously estimated, and new transboundary fish stocks are
identified almost every year. Several non-Arctic nations are already
seeking new fishing grounds in the Arctic Ocean. It is not solely the
five Arctic coastal states whose waters surround the high seas who are
responsible for [establishing]{.underline} the
[[Sanctuary]{.underline}]{.mark}. The area in question [is "beyond
national jurisdiction",]{.underline} which means [it is [part of the
global commons and therefore the responsibility of
every]{.mark}]{.underline}body, no matter if their
[[country]{.mark}]{.underline} lies on the other side of the world, or
is even landlocked. The five [Arctic]{.underline} coastal
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}, together with Arctic Council member
states, would [[need to work with the international community to secure
the Sanctuary]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that -- until now -- they
have consistently failed to do. A Sanctuary in [this [international
space must be part of a wider comprehensive network of]{.mark} MPAs,
[which also include areas within the exclusive economic
zones]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}EEZs) of the five Arctic coastal
states. This [[network is the cornerstone of effective ecosystem based
management]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is desperately needed and is
clearly part of the Arctic Council's mandate. However, despite almost 20
years work by scientists, it remains but a distant dream. Creating a
Sanctuary in the international waters of the Arctic The [[rules of
UNCLOS]{.mark} apply to these waters, [giving the legal requirement for
countries]{.mark} to [cooperate]{.mark} [to ensure the effective
protection]{.mark}]{.underline} and management of life in these areas,
including ice-covered waters. Political commitments have also been made
by the international community to ensure marine protection. In 2010 the
[CBD]{.underline} set a target for a global network of MPAs (within and
outside EEZs) covering at least 10% by 2020, and [called for
cooperation]{.underline} in the protection of marine biodiversity (CBD
Decision X/29 para. 32). The [process]{.underline} within the CBD to
identify EBSAs, including in the Arctic Ocean, [will add to the
[responsibility of governments to]{.mark} cooperate to [take]{.mark}
measures [to protect]{.mark} those [areas under
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including the Central Arctic
Ocean. The legal and political, as well as environmental, basis to act
is clearly there. Despite the black holes in Arctic governance there are
a [number of ways an Arctic [Sanctuary can be
created]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [simplest would be
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} a binding [[multilateral
agreement]{.mark}.]{.underline} At any time it would be possible for
[Arctic states, in collaboration with the international community, to
create a multilateral agreement [to control extractive and military
activity in]{.mark}]{.underline} the area of [international
[waters]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond their EEZs. The Arctic Search and
Rescue Agreement and the Agreement on Cooperation and Marine Oil
Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic are recent examples of
two regional treaties that have been concluded by members of the Arctic
Council. They illustrate that with enough political will [governments
can cooperate to make binding agreements.]{.underline} [[Another
route]{.mark} to create]{.underline} what is, in effect, [an
internationally managed marine reserve in the central Arctic Ocean [is
through a new "Implementing Agreement" under
UNCLOS.]{.mark}]{.underline} A [process is currently underway at the UN
General Assembly to decide on launching negotiations to address the
serious gaps in the global ocean governance systems]{.underline}, such
as specific rules for the protection of biodiversity in the high seas,
beyond a general call to "protect and preserve the marine environment"
(article 192). Greenpeace and other [civil society
[organizations]{.mark} are [seeking]{.mark} a new [implementing
agreement under UNCLOS to]{.mark} [ensure]{.mark} the [conservation and
sustainable use of]{.mark} marine [biodiversity]{.mark} in areas beyond
national jurisdiction]{.underline}, including the establishment of
marine reserves. However, a new UNCLOS implementing agreement is still
some way off, and even if the green light is given to initiate the
process which could lead to an agreement in 2015, it will be years
before it is negotiated and ratified. This is time that the Arctic can
ill afford. There are many other sector-based governance instruments
that cover the Arctic region, including Regional Fisheries Management
Organisations (RFMOs) and the International Maritime Organization, or
geographical-based treaties like OSPAR. All of these have advantages and
disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. They are, however, far from a
comprehensive solution to ensuring the establishment of a multi-sector
marine protected area. A [legally binding instrument dedicated to the
protection of the central Arctic Ocean basin, the [Arctic Sanctuary, is
the most straightforward option]{.mark}]{.underline}. Call for Action
The Arctic [Sanctuary is one of the most urgent issues of our time, and
is reflected across media, culture and public opinion. There [is so much
more to be gained from protecting]{.mark} it for future generations
[than exploiting it for a handful of corporations.]{.mark} Greenpeace
[call]{.mark}s [for]{.mark} [immediate action to be taken to create a
sanctuary in the Arctic, for the good of all life on
Earth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[Arctic security]{.mark} status quo]{.underline} relies on
international goodwill and consensus solutions, but this [[is]{.mark} a
**[fragile]{.mark} system**]{.underline}. The twentieth-century
mechanisms of strategic cooperation are not fit for twenty-first-century
purpose. To realists, the current Arctic security situation was
predictable. Realism emphasizes the state's pursuit of power to produce
security, achieve sovereignty, and ensure survival in an anarchic world.
Five states possess sovereign territory along the Arctic Ocean
coastline. These same five states therefore also have **[[national
security concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}** that, [[in the age of **nuclear
weapons**, constitute an **existential threat to
survival**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their coastal borders extend
territorial seas and [nonterritorial [e]{.mark}xclusive
[e]{.mark}conomic [z]{.mark}one[s]{.mark}]{.underline} into the depths
of the Arctic Ocean and [[complicate]{.mark} matters of
**accessibility** and **[extraction rights for]{.mark}** increasingly
apparent **[resource bounties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whereas the Arctic
was among the regions of focus for potential conflict during the Cold
War, for most of the twenty-first century the Arctic has hewed to
Mikhail Gorbachev's call, issued amid thawing tensions in 1987, for the
region to be a "zone of peace" and exceptionalism.
[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} [commercial and economic [**interests**
evolve,]{.mark}]{.underline} however, **[[competition
heightens]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With that, there are [[**competing
territorial claims** leading to **increasingly aggressive** maritime
**practices**]{.mark} and a steady **[northward creep of military
presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Absent a **consensus
solution**]{.mark} to these evolving issues, [the Arctic is]{.mark} back
in the [**crosshairs of international competition** and]{.mark}
**potential [future conflict.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Outside sovereign borders and territorial waters, [[**untold resources**
**exist**]{.mark} within the global commons]{.underline}---the shared
and ungoverned spaces of the world for all to access. To Hobbesian
realists, **[[Arctic resource competition is
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an anarchic international system
devoid of a central governing authority. The fear of losing military and
[economic advantage]{.underline} coupled with the perceived glory of
conquering the harsh **[Arctic]{.underline}** [[compel states]{.mark}
further [into the **resource competition arena**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Competition, fear (diffidence), and glory, according to Hobbes, are the
three causes of quarrel. [[States]{.mark} seeking power **[will
fight]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}for security to achieve safety,
relative gains, and reputational advantage. Each of these dynamics is at
play in the power politics of the Arctic today.

Prominent realist thinkers have long told us that the state of nature is
inherently violent and that because of this inclination, **[[conflict is
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}.** The product of these forces at work
in the **[[Arctic will be an environment punctuated by resource
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, fear, and glory with a disposition
for conflict that no international institution can quell. [The
[challenge is]{.mark} devising [a **workable solution**]{.mark} **that**
does not leave powerful states at a **relative
disadvantage**]{.underline}. To date, international institutions have
been unable to achieve this.

In brief, a sanctuary is necessary because the Arctic [Ocean
is]{.underline} one of the [[planet's]{.mark}]{.underline} few
[[remaining]{.mark}]{.underline} pristine [[marine
regions]{.mark}]{.underline} and it is particularly [[vulnerable to
human impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arctic and sub-Arctic waters are
among the most biologically productive in the world. For the first time
in human history, [permanent [sea ice]{.mark}]{.underline} is, however,
rapidly [[diminishing]{.mark}]{.underline} due to climate change[,
[opening]{.mark} up the]{.underline} international
[[waters]{.mark}]{.underline} of the central Arctic Ocean
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} oil [[exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}, to
[ship traffic, and]{.underline} to large-scale [industrial
fishing]{.underline}. The central [[Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}
may seem like a harsh and desolate place, but it is in fact [[teeming
with life that exists nowhere else]{.mark} on Earth.]{.underline} Bathed
in sunlight 24 hours a day in the summer months, the Arctic is alive
with ice-dependent mammals including polar bears, seals, walrus and
whales, as well as vast numbers of seabirds. It is also home to huge
shoals of fish, while sponge gardens and coldwater corals cover the
ocean floor. The presence of [sea ice in the Arctic [forms the
foundation of]{.mark} a unique [marine food chain]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [smallest [microorganisms and zooplankton survive]{.mark}
specifically [on the underside of]{.mark} the [ice]{.mark}]{.underline},
and are consumed by Arctic cod. These are eaten by seals, which in turn
are the staple food for polar bears. Seals also use the ice to give
birth and nurse their young. Polar bears, the unique and iconic predator
of the Arctic, roam the sea ice: it is their home.
[[All]{.mark}]{.underline} of this is now [[at]{.mark} risk [from human
activities]{.mark} such as oil drilling, industrial fishing, shipping
and seabed mining. [Science]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[recognized]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[high seas]{.mark}]{.underline}
area of the central Arctic Ocean [basin [as a place of huge biological
importance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A recent CBD Arctic Regional
Workshop to Facilitate the Description of Ecologically or Biologically
Significant Marine Areas [(EBSAs) assessed]{.underline} submissions
relating to the international waters of the Central Arctic Ocean,
including the permanently ice-covered waters. The Arctic
[[Sanctuary]{.mark} was [found to comprehensively meet the scientific
criteria to become an EBSA]{.mark}. This area]{.underline}, which
contains some highly vulnerable ecosystems and species, is [under
threat. A [strong need to limit human industrial activities]{.mark} and
[to increase]{.mark} further [scientific research]{.mark} has been
identified.]{.underline} The establishment of [[large-scale
marine]{.underline} [reserves]{.underline}]{.mark} has been shown to
[result in longlasting and often rapid increases in the abundance,
diversity and productivity of marine organisms]{.underline}. Not only
are they an important conservation and management tool, they are also
[[effective]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [building]{.mark} [resilience]{.mark} in
ocean ecosystems against a rapidly changing climate and acidifying
waters.]{.underline} Unlike Antarctica, there is [currently no single
overarching treaty governing activities in the Arctic. With only a
patchwork of differing rules and regulations in place]{.underline} (most
of which are not legally binding[) [the Arctic Ocean is currently wide
open to exploitation, bad practice and illegality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[Given the]{.mark} well-documented, [catastrophic decline of the
Arctic]{.mark}** Ocean sea ice ecosystem in recent **decades [due to
climate change, coupled with]{.mark} the [increasing threats]{.mark} and
[impacts from industry and military activity]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the region, **[[it is imperative that governments establish an
I]{.mark}nternational [A]{.mark}rctic [O]{.mark}cean
[Sanctuary]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to preserve this extraordinary
ecoregion as a global commons [for peaceful, non-commercial, scientific
purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Covering approximately 5.4 million square
miles[, the Arctic Ocean]{.underline} is one of the most extraordinary
and vibrant regions of the global ocean, and [plays an important role
regulating Earth's climate]{.underline}. [The Arctic marine ecosystem is
globally unique, productive, and remains relatively
unexplored]{.underline}**. The ocean biome** [supports more than 7,000
identified species]{.underline}**, many of which are found nowhere else
on Earth---polar bears, walrus, several kinds of ice seals, narwhals,
beluga whales, bowhead whales, some of the largest populations of
seabirds in the world, and many unique fish and invertebrate
populations.** [It hosts cold seeps, hydrothermal vents, stunning
benthic habitats, a rich pelagic ecosystem that remains surprisingly
active during winter darkness, and **supports the subsistence cultures
of coastal Indigenous Peoples**.]{.underline} **However**[,
[this]{.mark} unique polar marine [ecosystem is]{.mark} now [one of the
**most endangered regions of Earth's biosphere**, **suffering effects of
climate change more severely than anywhere else**]{.mark}. [Arctic sea
ice]{.mark} has declined by more than half in the last 50 years, losing
about 1 million square miles in both summer and winter, has thinned from
an average of four meters to about one meter, and [**could disappear
entirely in summer by 2035**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Multiyear sea [ice
has all but vanished]{.underline}**.** This remarkable decline has been
[caused by global carbon emissions]{.underline} **from human activity,
mainly fossil fuel use.** [[The loss]{.mark} of Arctic sea ice over the
last half-century [constitutes **one of the largest declines in
ecological habitat on Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rivaling the loss
of tropical rainforests. The resultant Arctic Ocean ecological crisis is
now [severe]{.underline}, [and ]{.mark}**[[predicted to get much
**worse** in coming decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In** addition to
devastating impacts of climate change in the Arctic Ocean, commercial
interests are clamoring to exploit ice-free offshore areas for oil and
gas, methane hydrates, minerals, commercial fishing, shipping, and
tourism. And Arctic coastal nations have made Extended Continental Shelf
(ECS) seabed claims (pursuant to U.N. Law of the Sea, Article 76) beyond
their 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), a dangerous territorial
expansion into international waters with an eye toward resource
extraction. As Arctic nations and others (China, India, etc.) advance
their own parochial interests across the region, **[there is a growing
competitive race to exploit Arctic offshore resources and to project
military power]{.underline}** across the region to secure these
competing national interests. As such**,** [[the risk of military
confrontation]{.mark} across the Arctic Ocean [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[escalating]{.underline}]{.mark}.** [Combined with the effects of
climate change, [industrialization and militarization would further
**accelerate** the ecological and social collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the struggling Arctic Ocean region, and would clearly compromise the
ability of the bioregion and its people to survive the 21st-century
climate crisis. In fact, the resource and political tensions in the
Arctic Ocean today are remarkably similar to the Antarctic after World
War II, that were resolved then by the leadership of U.S. (Republican)
President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposing and negotiating the historic
1959 Antarctic Treaty**.** [The international Treaty]{.underline}**, now
with 58 nation-state members, permanently** [protects the extraordinary
5.5 million square-mile Antarctic continent as a global commons for
peaceful, scientific purposes, free from nuclear testing, military
operations, economic exploitation, and territorial
claims]{.underline}**. The Antarctic Treaty remains the single greatest
conservation achievement in history.** [The same opportunity now
presents itself with the Arctic]{.underline} **Ocean. In addition to
accelerating efforts to reduce global carbon emissions to reverse global
warming[[, governments must urgently adopt strong, permanent protections
for the entire Arctic Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark} to give this region and
its people the best chance possible to survive the 21st-century climate
crisis. Given the pace of decline,** [this may be **[our
last]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[best [chance]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}to do so. While Arctic nations have begun protecting some areas
off their coasts, still [[less than 5% of]{.mark} Arctic Ocean [waters
are]{.mark} in permanently [protected]{.mark} status]{.underline}**.
This is clearly [insufficient]{.underline}.** The proposed circumpolar
Arctic Ocean Sanctuary must fully protect not only international waters
beyond coastal state 200-mile EEZs across the 1.1 million square mile
Central Arctic Ocean (as is currently proposed), but also the highly
productive waters within the EEZs of Arctic coastal
nations**---**[Canada, Norway, Denmark and Greenland, Russia, and the
U.S., [where **most ecological activity, human impact, and threat
occurs**]{.mark}. [The sanctuary should]{.mark} permanently [prohibit
oil and gas leasing, mineral leasing, commercial fishing, military
activities, improve shipping safety, reduce pollutants, and enhance
scientific research.]{.mark}]{.underline}

the rapid environmental shifts have a **disproportionate** effect on
communities across the Northern Hemisphere. **Thawing permafrost**
raises global attention because it **contributes** to the **release of
greenhouse gases.**]{.underline} Frozen soils are melting for the first
time in thousands of years. [The degradation also causes many **negative
consequences** for Arctic communities. Permafrost disrupts community
**infrastructure**, cultural **heritage,** and the Arctic **landscape**.
The growing seasons lengthen, greening the Arctic throughout the year,
which changes animal migration.]{.underline} Communities in several
Arctic regions have reported on the impact on subsistence activities.
Scientists have observed changes n hydrology where modifications in
drainage pathways have led to drying parts of the rivers, which in turn
affects travel routes\[1\]. [The consequences of climate change and
permafrost degradation can **profoundly** affect the lives of young
people, both in the present and the future. It is **crucial** to address

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) absorb infrared radiation and trap heat within
the atmosphere. To allow for a standardized measurement, these gases are
often measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (C02e); carbon is emitted
when fossil fuels are burned. Other GHGs include water vapour, methane,
and nitrous oxide. The presence of these GHGs contributes to a warming
planet. [Human activity can be directly **linked to** global temperature
**rise, warming oceans**, shrinking ice sheets, **glacial retreat**, sea
level rise, ocean acidification, and extreme weather
events.]{.underline}  In 2017, global temperatures reached 1 degree
Celsius above pre-industrial levels and the science is clear in saying
that the increasing rate of release of GHG emissions from
industrialization is the root cause. [Many areas around the world are
**warming at a greater rate** than the global average.]{.underline} The
impact of GHG emissions are not felt immediately because there is a lag
between the time of the emissions release and the associated warming
effects. Past emissions are continuing to contribute to temperatures
today, and any increase in the release of emissions today will be
exponentially more damaging in the future. This is due to the positive
feedback loops created by a warming world: for example the increased
atmospheric concentrations of GHGs cause events such as arctic sea ice
melt, which in turn causes sea water exposure which absorbs sunlight,
which then causes the earth to get warmer, which in turn causes more sea
ice melt\--in spirally perpetuity. [The extraction and processing of
natural **resources**]{.underline} (biomass, fossil fuels, metals, and
non-metallic minerals[) **make up half** of the global **greenhouse
gas** emissions while contributing to more than **90%** of global
diversity loss and **water** stress **impacts**.  In isolation, the
extraction and processing of just metals and other minerals is
responsible for 26% of global carbon emissions.]{.underline} [**The**
global **demand for natural resources** is at an **unsustainable**

population has doubled and global economic activity (GDP) has grown
fourfold since the 1970s, raising living standards and human well-being

economy were fuelled by a fast-growing material supply and extraction of
primary materials, increasing pressure on land and water. During the
period 1970 to 2017, annual global extraction of materials grew from
27.1 billion tons to 92.1 billion tons (average annual growth of 2.6
percent). The global average of material demand per capita grew from 7.4

produced by the U.S. Department of Defense, follows a
"monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this reactive strategy is

continue to [challenge Western international norms]{.mark} wherever
possible, [including in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO's growing
appeal among European states suggests that NATO may also be called upon
to guarantee the future of Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe,
isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of
Ukraine has resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and
its Arctic NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland
and Sweden, has expanded,, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations
are NATO members. The alliance offers an opportunity for the United
States to strengthen its position in the Arctic region while not having
to go it alone.

[[The current]{.mark} US Arctic [Strategy insufficiently counters

[ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}, though the makings of a more effective
Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024 Arctic Strategy.
Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its mindset towards
the Arctic. A proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in which the United
States and its NATO partners are not afraid to define the rules and laws
governing the north. Critics of this approach will claim that taking a
more assertive position in the Arctic will further antagonize Russia and
divert important resources from the Indo-Pacific region and China. This
is simply not the case. Russia and China have already taken steps to
claim and militarize the Arctic[[. By acting now, the US]{.mark} and its

region]{.underline} among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as

developments have increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.

threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to NATO member states. In October 2023,
Finnish investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of
dragging its anchor over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom
cables and one pipeline. While the international community has not
assigned blame wholly to China, China later admitted to accidentally
destroying an important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in
the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples suggest that incidents of this

The mining in the remote Taymyr Peninsula has also attracted the
attention of the Federal Security Service (FSB). In April this year, the
security service joined the environmental protection agency and filed a
suit against the Arctic coal miners**[. According to the FSB, [the
company]{.mark} not only [engaged in illegal mining]{.mark} but [also
unlawfully exported the coal]{.mark}, newspaper RBC
reported]{.underline}**. The state nature protection agency originally
demanded 2 billion rubles in fines for the coal miners. In June this
year, the Moscow arbitrary court ultimately ruled that the company must
pay 600 million rubles. The mining company immediately announced that it
would appeal the verdict. Scandinavian involvement The controversial
developments in Taymyr also has a link to Scandinavia. It was the Nordic
Bulk Carriers, a Danish shipping company, that delivered the shipments
of coal from Dikson to Europe in 2017. Under very complex conditions,
the ships «Nordic Bothnia» and the «Nordic Barents» in March 2017 made
shipments of coal from Dikson. Photos from site provided by nuclear
icebreaker captain Aleksandr Skryabin show how the «Nordic Barents» is
accompanied in thick ice to a local terminal facility. The operation was
highly difficult, and the Danish ship reportedly had a minor collision
with nuclear icebreaker «Vaigach» during the voyage. None of the ships
got serious damages and both were able to independently complete their
operations, Morvesti reported. The incident happed on the 14th of March
2017, the newspaper informs. In a comment to the Barents Observer, the
Danish company makes clear that the court proceedings against the Vostok
Coal will not affect cooperation between the partners. «We are aware of
the rumors around Vostokcoal but they do not concern our company or our
vessels,» says Managing Director Mads Boye Petersen. Cooperation will
continue this year, Boye Petersen makes clear. «We are in regular
contact with Vostokcoal with regards to shipments both in 2019 and
beyond,» he says. **[Also state nuclear company Rosatom has major stakes
in the Taymyr coal project. In 2017, Rosatom signed a cooperation
agreement with Vostok Coal that provides icebreaker assistance to the
shipments from Dikson]{.underline}**. In a video presentation available
on the website of Vostok Coal, high-ranking Rosatom representative
Vyacheslav Ruksha makes clear that the Taybass coal resources ultimately
will constitute a major share of the goods shipped along the Northern
Sea Route. Government backing **[[Despite the controversial character of
the mining operations and the violations conducted by the Vostok Coal,
the company has firm support from the highest political level.]{.mark}
The federal support for Dmitry Bosov and the Vostok Coal comes on the
backdrop of the huge plans for the development of the Northern Sea
Route. President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} in his so-called May Decrees
from 2018 [underlines that shipments on the Arctic route should increase
to 80 million tons of goods by]{.mark} the end of his presidential term
in [2024]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is a highly ambitious task and
federal authorities are now struggling to identify projects that could
help meet Putin's target. The coal from Taymyr might be necessary if the
goods volumes are to get close to the president's 80 million tons.
Encroachment on national park The two projected seaports on the Kara Sea
coast, the Chaika and the Severny, provide the necessary infrastructure
for the export of coal from the nearby mines. But the problem for Vostok
Coal is that the terminals are located within areas strictly regulated
by environmental legislation. **[The federal Ministry of Natural
Resources long rejected the company's construction plans in the area
because they were located too close to the borders of a local natural
park. The projected seaports are located only few hundred meters from
the protected Bay of Meduza, a local part of the large Big Arctic
National Park, one of Russia's biggest protected areas.]{.underline}**
In a report from 2016, the Ministry informs that it finds it impossible
to approve the project. In the area is also located the international
Willem Barentsz Biological Station, a research facility built in 1995
with support from Dutch authorities, the ministry says. «We are not
against the development of Dikson, but we and our federal managers
consider that the development of the town \[Dikson\] must not be
conducted in violation of the federal laws and regulations and with
damage of protected nature territories,» the statement from researchers
at the ministry reads. Environmentalists overrun **[[However,]{.mark}
despite the warnings from the environmental authorities, [the Vostok
Coal is now proceeding with its grand plan]{.mark}s, including the
building of the two port terminals. [The federal government]{.mark} [is
reported to]{.mark} be about to [change the borders of the Big Arctic
National Park, consequently allowing Vostok Coal to go ahead with its
construction works.]{.mark}]{.underline}** According to newspaper RBC,
the Maduza Bay will no longer be part of the national park. **[Dmitry
Bosov and his [Vostok Coal is ready to significantly change the
vulnerable tundra land of the Taymyr]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By 2024,
the powerful businessman intends to have a fleet of ships shuttling to
and from the icy ports on the coast of the peninsula. By 2024, the
shiploads of coal is to amount to 19 million tons. It will be boost for
Northern Sea Route shipping. And a blow to Arctic environment.

He writes on Sri Lanka and International affairs) "Why drilling doesn't need to mean more ham to the environment" from Sri Lanka Guardian, 30 Jan 2025, https://slguardian.org/why-more-drilling-doesnt-need-to-mean-more-harm-to-the-environment/ 

**[Why [drilling doesn't need to mean more ham to the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}** The slogan \"Drill, baby, drill!\"
became iconic during the 2016 presidential election in the U.S. as part
of a campaign to increase domestic fossil-fuel production. With Donald
Trump\'s push for expanded oil and gas extraction, it\'s clear that
fossil fuel development is set to continue, especially with the support
of key figures in the Department of Energy, the Department of the
Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency. While some level of
oil and gas extraction was always going to be part of the future energy
mix, the challenge now is how to balance this with the urgent need to
curb environmental degradation and move toward decarbonization**[. [In a
new report published in Nature]{.mark}, it is argued that the [expansion
of oil and gas drilling doesn\'t necessarily equate to more harm to the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- provided it is done thoughtfully.
The key to reconciling energy production with environmental protection
lies in a holistic approach that considers the entire energy system from
resource extraction to end-use, **[[rather than isolating individual
components of energy infrastructure]{.mark}. [The report suggests that
focusing on the broader energy \"ecosystem]{.mark}\" can help
policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders [find]{.mark}
sustainable [solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** . The federal
government\'s control over oil and gas production is primarily
restricted to federal lands and waters, which make up a small portion of
U.S. Moreover, drilling on federal lands may not be the most
economically viable option, as these regions are often remote and harder
to access compared to other, more accessible oil and gas reserves. Even
if President Trump\'s executive orders encourage exploration, **[the
feasibility of such projects could be compromised by the difficult
legal, environmental, and logistical realities they face.]{.underline}**
As an energy geographer, the author of the Nature report notes that
while energy policy often appears to be heavily influenced by the oil
and gas industry through lobbying groups, states can play a vital role
in regulating energy production. For example, regulations around
fracking have largely been shaped by state---level decisions, with each
state borrowing from the experiences and regulations of others to find a
balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Agencies
like the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, formed in 1935, help
facilitate communication I between regulators and promote collaborative
regulatory approaches to I ensure that energy extraction is conducted
responsibly. Yet, as the report highlights, there is a need for a
broader and more comprehensive approach to regulation that goes beyond
managing individual oil and gas facilities in isolation. Current
state---level **[[regulations often treat each infrastructure
project---whether it\'s a fracking well, pipeline, or processing
facility---as a stand---alone entity.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, as
the report argues, **[these [facilities are interconnected, forming an
\"industrial ecosystem\" that spans across regions]{.mark}. A case study
conducted by the author in Pennsylvania,]{.underline}** which involved
mapping more than 20,000 pieces of energy infrastructure connected to a
petrochemical facility, revealed that the true environmental impact of
these facilities cannot be fully understood without considering how they
interact with other energy projects, from extraction sites to processing
plants and end-users.

#### **[[The risk of points-of-no-return]{.mark}, which, once surpassed lock the world into new dynamics, have been discussed for decades.]{.underline}** Recently, there have been warnings that some of these tipping points are coming closer and are too dangerous to be disregarded. **[In this paper we report that in the ESCIMO [climate model the world is already past a point-of-no-return for global warming.]{.mark} In ESCIMO we observe self-sustained thawing of the permafrost for hundreds of years, even if global society stops all emissions of man-made GHGs immediately.]{.underline}** We encourage other model builders to explore our discovery in their (bigger) models, and report on their findings.

Do you lie awake at night in a panic over global warming? Have you thought about not having children because of climate change? I felt like that. To alleviate my climate anxiety, I went to work at a solar energy company in the American Midwest, installing through solar panels the carbon dioxide offset equivalent to planting over a million trees. But the more I learned about my field, the more I became convinced that climate change, while real, is one of the biggest psyops of our time---inducing us to live in a state of fear and existential dread while neglecting other environmental and spiritual dangers that threaten humanity. There is a lot of understandable anxiety surrounding global warming. When one 2019 survey asked Gen Z and Millennials to name the biggest problem facing their generation was, "climate change" took the top spot. It's indisputable that the earth is warming, and that this warming is significantly influenced by human activity. But how this will affect our society and planet has only been portrayed one way, as apocalyptic---until now. View fullsize In mass media, extremely negative forecasts of the future are presented as fact, like maps showing the world becoming a desert by 2100 except for Canada and Russia. This is absurd considering that we can't even predict the weather a week from now, that scientists have separately found that global warming has explosively greened up to half of the the planet's vegetated areas, and that many climate predictions, such as 75% of the Arctic ice cap disappearing by 2016 or sea levels rising 20 feet by now, simply aren't anywhere close to coming true. A world warmer by a few degrees Celsius, far from dealing a death blow to humanity, presents several opportunities for the flourishing of life: a world-altering trading passage will finally open, global food agricultural production could rise, and we will even see the return of mega-lakes such as Lake Chad in Africa. This certainly depends on the degree of warming: for example, a 2.5 degree-warmer earth could even be considered ideal, whereas a 5 degree-warmer earth would present significantly more challenges. [Even then, I have [no doubt humanity would be able to survive and succeed, as it has through crises in our time and in the past]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an unpopular opinion. In fact, an AI like ChatGPT literally can't tell you one positive benefit of marginal global warming, as it said when I asked: "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with reasons why an increase in temperature by 1 degree Fahrenheit would be beneficial to biodiversity, nature, or human society. Climate change and global warming, which are largely driven by human activities, have already caused significant impacts on the planet..." yadda yadda yadda. There will be negative effects of global warming. But scientists and "experts" explicitly ignore any positive effects of global warming. Dissident climatologists like Dr. Judith Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, have stated this is because entire academic careers, professional recognition, and media spotlights are linked to one's degree of alarmism over climate change. (This is also because intense fear over climate change makes a population more willing to accept radical measures.) Well, that's why we have Countere. Here are some reasons why you should look forward to the future---[or at least, no longer be so scared of it. View fullsize [The Northwest Passage Will Open]{.mark} The first [major benefit of global warming]{.mark} is that the legendary Northwest Passage will finally open. For all of recorded history, the only ocean route connecting the Pacific to the Atlantic curled around the tip of South America, making such journeys either impossible or extremely long]{.underline}. Although that changed with the opening of the Panama Canal, the Northwest Passage, which weaves through Canada's islands and exits at either Alaska or Greenland, promises an even more direct journey. View fullsize The historical problem was that the Northwest Passage was impassable due to ice---but that is all changing. The passage became completely ice-free for the first time in the summer of 2007. Global warming would finally wrest this route from its frozen lockbox, going so far as to halve international shipping times and inject a dose of vitality similar to the effects of the Panama Canal into the world economy. Millions of Square Miles Will Become Livable According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global warming would warm winters more than summers and lead to increase in temperatures at the extremities of the earth more than at the equator. Vast tracts of land in Alaska, Siberia, and Canada will thaw and become truly habitable for the first time in human history. [[The quality of the soil and water in these places]{.mark}, completely untouched by the Age of Agriculture[, is inconceivable to the modern human]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the loss of low-lying islands will undoubtedly be a huge tragedy, significantly more livable land will open up to both humans and animals in a warmer world. Even at the worst ends of our climate projections---a planet which is 4 or 5 degrees Celsius hotter---large portions of Antarctica will become pleasant and farmable. This raises all sorts of interesting questions: whether a "Scramble for Antarctica" will begin among the world's great powers, if there will be major wars fought in Antarctica, or if an Antarctican civilization will rise in the far-future. Worldwide Food Production Will Increase Moderate global warming has positive ramifications for food production. In many regions, spring will start earlier and growing seasons will be longer. [A hotter climate would increase evaporation from the oceans and lead to more rainfall globally. Also, studies show that at both higher temperatures and carbon dioxide levels, [crops and other plants grow better and are more drought-tolerant.]{.mark} Economist Bjørn Lomborg has estimated that global warming would boost cereal production in richer countries by 4-14 percent, while cutting them in poorer countries by 6-7 percent. The official [IPCC assessment]{.mark} is that "a [few degrees of projected warming will lead to general increases in temperate crop yields, with some regional variation]{.mark}]{.underline}." A 2007 report by the US Department of Agriculture found that global warming was likely to have a small positive effect on world food production, and therefore agricultural prices will possibly decrease[. [The Earth Will Become Greener]{.mark} View fullsize Change in worldwide leaf surface from 1982 to 2015. Green means more vegetation, while purple indicates losses.]{.underline} Source: Boston University Though popular visions of global warming see the earth transforming into an inhospitable desert, climate change has actually been responsible for an explosion of greenery on the planet. Researchers at Boston University have shown that over the last three decades, 31% of the global vegetated area of the planet has become significantly greener, with just 3% becoming less green---an increase they attribute primarily to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. [Other studies, such as this one cited by NASA, show [dramatic growth in up to 50%]{.mark} of Earth's vegetated areas since the 1980s]{.underline}. Even the IPCC predicts a worldwide increase in global timber supply from forestry growth due to global warming. Many argue that climate change will harm the world's poorest and disproportionately affect places like Africa. What they don't tell you is that the decline of famines in central Africa in recent years is partly due to the increased rainfall caused by global warming. In fact, the entire Sahel region of Africa has shown a huge increase in green vegetation since the 1970s. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research projects that due to global warming, the Sahel could receive 50% more rain by 2040. Lake Mega-Chad Will Return View fullsize How Africa might look in a world that is 2 degrees Celsius warmer, with Lake Mega-Chad in the center. Instead of solely eradicating land, global warming will cause the world's geography to shift, like an internally moving temple in a Zelda game, returning features to the planet only known from ancient memory. As increased rains wallop the African continent, **[[Lake Mega-Chad, once]{.mark} the biggest freshwater lake on planet earth until possibly Roman times, [will swell into a new center of vitality on the African continent.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Apart from being epic and based, Mega-Chad and other emergent lakes will provide fresh water for local communities and new habitats for plants and animals. [Some [Countries Will Become Wealthier]{.mark} Far from only dealing negative damage to humanity, climate change creates a new equilibrium, in which some nations experience losses and other nations experience benefits.]{.underline} The United States is one country that will benefit from at least moderate warming. The American public vastly prefers warm weather to cold, and both death rates and healthcare costs are lower in warmer states. In 1998, economist Thomas Moore estimated that the [[net benefits]{.mark} to the United States of a warmer climate could be as high as 1 percent of the [GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the flip side, spending Brobdingnagian amounts of money or remaking our societies to mitigate climate change appears to be massively ineffective. The European Union's [[climate policies are estimated to cost £1.8 trillion over the course of the century, just to lower the temperature by about 0.005˚C---an undetectable amount to a normal thermometer]{.underline}]{.mark}. The consensus among economists is that every £100 spent fighting climate change brings £3 of benefit. That money could be better spent investing in the world's poor, cleaning the oceans of micro-plastics, or creating technology to adapt to global warming, to name a few options. Less People Might Die From Natural Disasters Cold kills more people than heat. Countries like Britain and Greece see mortality rates rise by as much as 18 per cent each winter. In general, [[warmer temperatures create more favorable conditions for human populations to grow]{.underline}.]{.mark} In the last 100 years, an unprecedented period of warming, the death rate from droughts, floods and storms has dropped by 98%, according to a report by scholar Indur Goklany. In fact, a 2013 IPCC report says that while regional trends in cyclone frequency have been observed in the North Atlantic since the 1970s, "current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century and it remains uncertain whether any reported long-term increases in tropical cyclone frequency are robust." The paper goes on to say that "consistent with the majority of studies performed for higher degrees of global warming, the total number of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease under global warming, whilst the most intense (categories 4 and 5) cyclones are projected to occur more frequently." While we will definitely experience calamities as the temperature rises, they happen frequently at our current temperature, happened frequently in the past, and would arguably be more deadly if the Earth experienced a cooldown[. [The Next Ice Age Will be Avoided]{.underline}]{.mark} [View fullsize Title screen from a 1978 TV episode narrated by Leonard Nimoy speculating that a new ice age was approaching. This is probably the [most]{.mark} memed [benefit of global warming]{.mark}, but worth mentioning regardless: up until essentially the 70s, humanity was deeply concerned about an impending ice age. [Natural drivers]{.mark} seemed to be [pushing our planet towards a devastating cooling period]{.mark}]{.underline}. If the Earth was getting cooler rather than warmer, it would likely be more catastrophic for humanity, with more droughts, more famine, more food insecurity, more extinctions, and more natural disasters. Bear in mind that modern ["[civilization" only emerged because]{.mark} an [ice age ended]{.mark} roughly 11,500 years ago. (At least these are things an AI will acknowledge.) Climate change is not a new phenomenon. The Earth has been much hotter and colder before. In fact, over the 4-billion-year lifespan of the Earth, [warmer periods are correlated with the flourishing of life]{.mark}, while colder temperatures are tied to mass extinctions. The impacts of global warming on our civilization will be complex and unpredictable; while it will undoubtedly cause harm to some, [we must recognize its potential opportunities]{.mark}.]{.underline} We only get one side of the story---the one meant to intimidate us and convince us that the only way to prevent climate Armageddon is to vote for a certain political party or to radically remake our society. Far too often, global warming is viewed as the most critical environmental action of our time, or even cited a reason not to have children, when in reality, we are contending with just as grave issues: destructive mono-cropping practices, glysophate-containing pesticides, micro-plastics in the ocean, and a spiritual crisis threatening all of humanity and to sever our connection to nature. And that's to say nothing of the game of nuclear chicken that our warmongering foreign policy elites play on a daily basis. You are being lied to about climate change. [[Global warming does not mean the end of the world.]{.mark} It means a new world with new challenges. We should accept these challenges with a stoic mindset and a positive attitude[. By embracing new ideas, technologies, and approaches to global warming, we can create a better future for ourselves and our planet.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the meantime, I encourage active environmentalism such as picking up trash, working in renewable energy, or exploring your local woods.
