### Notes

Questions: Johnisthe4@gmail.com

This AFF creates information gathering patrols and deployments in the
Arctic and uses that data and information to better inform homeland
missile defense systems. Some key acronyms in the file include:

**BMD** -- ballistic missile defense.

**MDA** -- missile defense agency.

**GMD** -- ground-based midcourse defense.

**NGI** -- next-generation interceptor.

**ICBM** -- intercontinental ballistic missile.

**ASAT** -- anti-satellite weapon.

**New START** -- New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

**FOBS** -- fractional orbital bombardment systems.

The main NEG strategy is to ban all missile defense and argue missile
defense makes China and Russia scared of American capabilities. This
will cause them to build up dangerous nuclear systems that could cause
accidental nuclear war. There are also case turns to the third advantage
about arms control. It is important to note that the Strategic Stability
DA and arms control turns are not mutually exclusive, but they do have
some potentially contradictory elements depending on how a team wants to
extend the argument.

Rock Chalk!

Maj. Gen. Mark "Pied" [Piper:]{.underline} It is. It's great to be
integrated in technology, and that's certainly one of our big priorities
here at NORAD.\[00:41:00\] And it's great to be integrated as a
binational command, you know, now in our 68th year here at NORAD. That's
fantastic, and we continue to do well in those areas. But how we
integrate the mission itself, both from an operational perspective, and
really what I'll say from a mentality perspective, as kind of part of
modernization and how we think about what Homeland Defense as a mission
is. And what I'll say on that is, I think, historically, you know, in
kind of policy and in theory, and in our writing, we would talk about
Homeland Defense as the number 1 priority, but in reality, it never
really was like that. We thought of like, well, look, we've got 2 or 3
oceans surrounding us. So the threat's not really there. It's really
kind of a defensive, isolated goalie type of mission. When you look at
homeland defense more recently, there was some thought that, hey, if
we're going to invest in Homeland Defense, all that is doing is in the
zero sum money game we operate in, \[00:42:00\] in both money and time,
we're taking our eye off the ball in China. And my argument would be
that we need to [[think]{.mark} of [Homeland Defense not as]{.mark} an
isolated, [defensive]{.mark}, just in case]{.underline}, supported [only
mission]{.underline}. We need to [think of it as a]{.underline}
fundamentally [integrated mission. [It is foundational to
everything]{.mark} we do [in]{.mark} terms of global [power
projection]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need to think of Homeland Defense as
being simultaneously a supported admission and a supporting mission. So,
[whether]{.underline} or not [we're]{.underline} talking about, you
know, our ability [to project power from a global presence
standpoint]{.underline}, our ability to do to turn ops, just force flow,
for example, whether or not we're taking force flow, just as an example
from Alaska or our supporting role in North America [[for]{.mark} our
[support to INDOPAC]{.mark}]{.underline}OM [or
[EU]{.mark}]{.underline}COM [[or NATO at the seams]{.mark} of our areas
of responsibility]{.underline}. We need to [[think]{.mark} of [homeland
defense as]{.mark}]{.underline} not just kind of why we exist, but also
as [[an enabler to]{.mark} other missions]{.underline}, \[00:43:00\] uh,
for both the US and Canada. James, I, I think Canada thinks the same way
about this.

Brig. Gen. James [Hawthorne:]{.underline} Absolutely, and you said that
very eloquently and just going to throw on. We have the watch because
that is truly what's occurring. [We have the watch so]{.underline} that
North [America is secure]{.underline}. So that both countries [can
[deploy forces]{.mark} abroad [quickly]{.mark} and
[decisively]{.mark}]{.underline} to work with our global partners and
doing all that [[while not exposing]{.mark} our [populations to]{.mark}
threats or [retal]{.mark}]{.underline}iation. So, while we have the
watch and modernizing that thought process for global integration, we're
really achieving that day in and day out here at NORAD and US NORTHCOM.

Heather "Lucky" [Penney:]{.underline} I really like how both you
gentlemen phrase that because I think, uh, you know, [Homeland Defense
is a foundation of power projection. [We]{.mark} like to [play the away
game]{.mark} to ensure that harm never comes]{.underline} to our
populations, to our citizens, [to our homelands, [but]{.mark} we
[can't]{.mark} do that [if]{.mark} we're [not able to ensure]{.mark}
that our [homelands are safe]{.mark}]{.underline}, that they are secure,
they are defended. And it's more than just making sure that bombs aren't
blowing up in the neighborhood, um, you know, in the neighborhood
schoolyard. It's \[00:44:00\] also ensuring that we have security across
all of our different requirements and resources from electricity to, um,
the internet to our infrastructure so that we can actually physically
deploy and flow forces forward to fight the fight away and not at home.

Brig. Gen. Houston "Slider" Cantwell, USAF (Ret.): Yeah, and I think
sadly, as we look at this with more granularity. I think we're going to
see that there are significant resource challenges when it comes to
trying to handle multiple planning efforts as well as execution of these
plans. Were they to be executed simultaneously?

Heather "Lucky" Penney: And that also gets to force sizing Slider. So, I
will make the statement that I do not believe that our military and
certainly not our Air Force's force size to be able to do the hold back
necessary to defend the homeland as well as flow forces forward to power
project.

Brig. Gen. Houston "Slider" Cantwell, USAF (Ret.): Yeah. I couldn't
agree more.

Heather "Lucky" [Penney:]{.underline} So gentlemen, as we close this
podcast, I think it's really important to note that although we're
focused on the future and what NORAD needs to modernize into, your
vision for the future, how you're sort of changing your posture, your
\[00:45:00\] positioning, and the way you're thinking about the mission
set and the integration across the broader strategic requirements for
both Canada and the United States, that this is a mission that you've
never dropped, right? I mean, so we're looking towards the future, but
you continue to stand the watch today. And [[although]{.mark} we're
looking at [China and Russia]{.mark} and thinking that they [might be
distracted by]{.mark}]{.underline} their activities, whether or not
that's a focus on [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, um, and
[China's]{.underline} focus on what they're doing within their own
national [[economy]{.mark}. Russia in [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} as
well, [[that]{.mark} they are continuing to be]{.underline} assertive
and [aggressive within the Arctic.]{.underline}

Maj. Gen. Mark "Pied" [Piper: Exactly. There's]{.underline}, I think
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a little bit of [[a
misperception]{.underline}]{.mark} that, you know, say [[Russia
is]{.mark} preoccupied in Ukraine]{.underline}, uh, as you mentioned, is
one example and while it is true in terms of from the perspective, a lot
of what we pay attention to is their long range aviation program. There
is a short live dip in their out of area strategic deterrent patrols at
the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, [but they're]{.underline}
\[00:46:00\] [rapidly [back to]{.mark} the [historic
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is where they sit
[today]{.underline}. And I think, you know, our job here at NORAD is to,
you know, just assume that they're always going to be engaging in that
activity. And a short term lull in their frequency of, say, air defense
identification zone penetrations is not going to last long. And that's
what we saw here. So, You know, just for example, like this past July,
this past September, this past December, where they've done AIDZ is
penetrations. We were there. We monitored it. We detected it. We
responded to it. We will not want to give any indications that we're not
continuing to pay attention to this. [[Same]{.mark} thing [with
China.]{.mark} They have not reduced their
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} as an example, like all their
maritime operations they're doing [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
right now. [[They are only increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} that as well
as their introduction of [bomber [patrols]{.mark} into the
Arctic]{.underline}. It only shows that they are not preoccupied. I
give, little, uh, word salad here, if you will, of [China]{.underline}
\[00:47:00\] [is everything everywhere all at once. And Russia
is]{.underline} trying to do [the same]{.underline} thing. [We need to
be prepared for that]{.underline}, which goes back to our focus in NORAD
is we have to be integrated globally because our adversaries are also
integrated globally.

Brig. Gen. James [Hawthorne:]{.underline} And I think a piece that we
always forget in the big picture of what NORAD is, well, [[Russia and
China]{.mark} are]{.underline} doing their piece and slowly, being [able
to [coordinate]{.mark} activities [together]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
think we really have to remember that NORAD is that binational single
command that has two countries fully integrated and coordinated, working
day in and day out together [[to protect the
homelands]{.underline}]{.mark}. And that [[enables]{.underline}]{.mark},
both [[nations to project our forces]{.underline}]{.mark} to keep our
homeland safe.

#### High north domain awareness [is key]{.underline}\-\--it's where the homeland is [most vulnerable]{.underline}, triggering imminent fait accompli.

Abstract

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), as a combined
U.S.-Canada command charged with aerospace warning, aerospace control,
and maritime warning in the defense of North America, identifies cruise
missile attacks as a serious threat to the U.S. homeland.1 [Russia and
China continue to diversify their arsenals of]{.underline} guided
[missiles]{.underline}, which can fly at low altitudes, have
unpredictable flight paths, may reach hypersonic speeds, and be launched
from air, sea, or subsurface platforms.

[[The Arctic]{.mark} has [remained an attractive]{.mark} attack [vector
for]{.mark}]{.underline} both U.S. and [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
long-range aviation [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} missiles since the
earliest days of the Cold War. [The]{.underline} growing [Arctic
presence of [China]{.mark}, a]{.underline} self-proclaimed ["near-Arctic
state"]{.underline} possessing an increasingly robust long-range
aviation and missile inventory, [reinforces the region's significance
[as]{.mark} a [staging ground for]{.mark} air and cruise missile
[attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The U.S. Department of Defense continues to invest billions to defend
against limited ballistic missile attacks, but [the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} military's [[ability to
detect]{.underline}]{.mark}, track, and defeat [[a]{.mark} cruise
missile [strike]{.mark}]{.underline} emanating [from the Arctic [has
degraded]{.mark}]{.underline} significantly [over the past 30 years.
[China or Russia could exploit this]{.mark} shortfall]{.underline} using
conventional cruise missile attacks [to [deal a quick blow that keeps
U.S.]{.mark} military [forces at distance]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid
a nuclear response.

[Bolstering [deterrence]{.mark} against]{.underline} conventional air
and cruise [missile threats in the Arctic [starts by]{.mark}
improving]{.underline} U.S., ally, and partner [[domain
awareness]{.mark} and info]{.underline}rmation [dominance capabilities.
[Adversaries]{.mark} will [be disinclined to launch strikes on
the]{.mark} U.S. [homeland if they know]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
anticipating]{.mark} the [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} and creating
options to dissuade it. Achieving better domain awareness involves
efforts to provide indications and warning of attacks through the
detection, tracking, characterization, warning, and attribution of
modern threats.2 Establishing information dominance enables U.S. leaders
to access decision-quality information more quickly than adversaries.
Domain awareness and information dominance can underwrite a
comprehensive "missile defeat" strategy, left and right of launch, that
gives U.S. leaders more options to deter an attack on the U.S. homeland.

Introduction

In keeping with his penchant for making bold predictions about the
future of airpower, Army Air Corps Brigadier General William "Billy"
Mitchell told a U.S. Senate Committee in 1935 that Alaska would become
"the most important strategic place in the world."3 In the mind of
Mitchell, widely considered the father of the U.S. Air Force, the reason
for the strategic significance of Alaska, and the Arctic more broadly,
came down to its accessibility by air. By Mitchell's calculations, U.S.
Army aircraft of the time could reach any capital in the Northern
Hemisphere within nine hours.4 He also warned that the dawn of aviation
would allow adversaries to capitalize on new attack vectors [through the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} because of the [short, direct [aviation
routes]{.mark} between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Eurasia,]{.underline} particularly [between Alaska and
Siberia]{.underline}. In his 1930 book, Skyways, Mitchell warned, "It is
[along these lines]{.underline} that [future invasions will come because
they [are the shortest]{.mark} lines and aircraft will fly directly
along them]{.underline}."5

Today, Mitchell's predictions regarding the strategic significance of
the northern approaches seem even more prescient. [The shortest path by
air]{.underline} to North America [[for]{.mark} Russian or Chinese
[missiles]{.mark}, fighters, and bombers is still over the polar
region]{.underline}. Both have diversified their cruise missile arsenals
and expanded their ability to launch cruise missile strikes on the
continental United States from the air, sea, and land (see Figure 2).

[[Yet,]{.mark} the U.S. [ability to detect]{.mark}, track,
attribute]{.underline}, and counter these [[attacks has]{.mark}
significantly [diminished]{.mark}]{.underline} since the end of the Cold
War. This reality was [[laid bare]{.underline}]{.mark} to the American
public in January 2023, [[when a]{.mark} Chinese [spy balloon
entered]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. airspace [north of
[Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline} and drifted across the entire country
before NORAD shot it down. General Glen VanHerck, Commander of U.S.
Northern Command and NORAD, later testified to Congress that four
Chinese surveillance balloons had previously transited U.S. airspace
undetected: "That's a domain awareness gap we'll have to figure out," he
told lawmakers.6

This paper examines the strategic implications of growing air and cruise
missile threats emanating from the high north, as well as potential
near-term approaches to address those threats. Mitchell Institute met
with over a dozen NORAD/NORTHCOM personnel in Colorado Springs, CO in
March 2023, interviewed experts from industry and academia, conducted a
review of government budget and strategy documents, and digested
contemporary academic and policy papers to address three core questions:

• To what extent do Russian and Chinese interests and missile
capabilities in the Arctic pose a threat to the U.S. homeland?

• How and why is the U.S. approach to deterring air and cruise missile
threats in the Arctic changing, and what are the risks and benefits of
that approach?

• What steps can the United States take to bolster deterrence in the
Arctic region, and what are some specific capabilities needed to do so?

Importantly, analysis revealed that [Arctic [domain
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} and information dominance [[should
be]{.mark} a [top]{.mark}]{.underline} DOD [[priority now]{.mark}, not
in a decade or more, [to shore up]{.mark}]{.underline} cruise missile
[defense of [the homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States and
Canada have tentative plans to field additional over-the-horizon radars
(OTHR) that can detect a broad swath of threats like bombers flying at
medium altitudes, low-flying cruise missiles, and even surface ships in
the next five to ten years.7 But [the risk that adversaries could turn
regional conflicts]{.underline} into global ones [already exists
today]{.underline}---whether it is through kinetic [cruise missile
attacks]{.underline}, non-kinetic [cyberattacks, or]{.underline} even
[provocative ISR overflights of the U.S. homeland that lead to
inadvertent escalation or miscalc]{.underline}ulation.

[Russia and]{.underline}, increasingly, [China are building up
capabilities to deal the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [a
quick, painful blow]{.underline} specifically [designed to coerce the
U.S.]{.underline} Government [to abstain from]{.underline} further
[involvement]{.underline} without provoking a nuclear response. China
and Russia's development of longer-range weapons, combined with new
capabilities to strike through cyberspace and space, is specifically
aimed to help them achieve this goal. The DOD must find new ways to
deter and defeat these threats that may be conventional in character but
can have long-lasting, even existential, strategic effects on the United
States, its allies, and its partners.

Unfortunately, completing kill chains against cruise missiles that can
maneuver and fly at low altitudes is notoriously difficult. Cruise
missiles can be difficult to detect from a distance, which reduces time
and options to counter them. Even if they are detected and attributed in
time to act, it is resource-intensive to shoot them down using DOD's
current kinetic defenses, which tend to be expensive and create an
unfavorable cost-exchange ratio. As subsonic garden-variety cruise
missiles continue to evolve and proliferate globally, other air and
missile threats, including hypersonic and ballistic missiles,
uninhabited aircraft, and even China's fractional orbital bombardment
system (FOBs), are posing increasingly complex challenges to U.S.
homeland defense.

To deal with these threats, U.S. defense leaders have gradually adopted
a new emphasis over the last decade on a holistic concept called
"missile defeat."8 Rather than narrowly focusing on kinetic kill options
to deny adversary attacks, missile defeat involves using the entire
spectrum of options to prevent and defeat missile threats, from
countering proliferation to early indications and warning and, of
course, detection, tracking, and intercepting cruise missiles. It also
seeks to integrate defensive, offensive, passive, kinetic, and
non-kinetic capabilities, the latter of which could include cyber
warfare, directed energy, and electronic attacks (see Figure 4).9

NORAD, which has more than half its area of responsibility focused on
the Arctic, mainly channels its missile defeat efforts into detecting
threats as early and proactively as possible. To this end, NORAD/U.S.
Northern Command, have made "all domain awareness" a top priority. As
applied to air and missile threats, the term describes all efforts to
enable "indications and warnings through detection, tracking,
identification, characterization, warning and attribution."10 The goal
of this "left-of-launch" approach is to expand decision space for senior
U.S. leaders so they are not left with only highly escalatory response
options, such as preemptive or retaliatory strikes.11 Gen VanHerck
describes the ability to give U.S. decisionmakers the information needed
to expand their options as "information dominance" and argues that
increased domain awareness, when combined with information dominance,
will lead to enhanced deterrence.12

Over, Through, & Under: Russian & Chinese Threats from the Northern
Approaches

To what extent do Russian and Chinese interests and missile capabilities
in the Arctic pose a threat to the U.S. homeland? Homeland defense,
defined as "the protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic
population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats
and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President," is the
responsibility of the U.S. Department of Defense.13 Adversaries that
pose the most credible and stressing threats to U.S. national security
generally meet three criteria: 1) their objectives are adversarial to
U.S. interests; 2) their actions threaten important U.S. interests; and
3) they possess the significant military capabilities necessary to
follow through on those hostile intentions.14 In the Arctic region, both
Russia and, increasingly, China fit these criteria and therefore pose a
serious challenge for U.S. homeland defense strategy and force planning.

Russian & Chinese Arctic Activities Threaten the U.S. Homeland

The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of
eight nations: Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (including Greenland),
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.15 Yet,
despite the Arctic's geographic size, proximity to U.S. territory, and
role as a staging ground for offensive missile strikes, the 2022
National Defense Strategy warns that "U.S. activities and posture in the
Arctic should be calibrated, as the Department preserves its focus on
the Indo-Pacific region."16

[[A]{.mark} central [goal of]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. efforts to
bolster [[deterrence is]{.underline}]{.mark} focused on [[dissuading
China or Russia]{.mark} from attempting to [rapidly seize]{.mark} the
territory of [a U.S. ally]{.mark} or partner [like Taiwan or]{.mark} one
or more of the [Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 So it is a natural
and appropriate result that, today, the center of gravity for great
power competition and conflict is in these adversaries' near peripheries
in the Indo-Pacific and Europe.18 But [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and other adversaries also
[[recognize]{.mark} America's power projection advantages and are
developing]{.underline} strategies and doctrine around cruise
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} and other long-range capabilities [to
[prevent]{.mark} the [U.S. forces]{.mark} from [deploying]{.mark} abroad
[in the first place]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The high north is]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming [an increasingly
[attractive]{.mark} vector [for]{.mark} Russian and Chinese missile
[strikes on the]{.mark} U.S. [homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}. More than
half the Arctic coastline is sovereign Russian territory.19 Russia is
modernizing its military bases and airfields, deploying new coastal air
defenses and submarines, and increasing its military exercises and
training within its 5th Military District, Moscow's Arctic combatant
command.20 China now self identifies as a "near-Arctic state," has
expanded Arctic scientific research activities that have military
applications, invested more than \$90 billion in Arctic infrastructure
projects, and stated its intent to build a "polar silk road."21

Broken America," Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/strange-triumph-broken-america-michael-beckley/)

[[The world]{.mark} now [faces converging threats: China]{.mark} is
carrying out]{.underline} the largest peacetime [military
buildup]{.underline} since Nazi Germany's, producing warships, combat
aircraft, and missiles five to six times as fast as the United States
can. [[Russia]{.mark} is waging]{.underline} Europe's biggest
[war]{.underline} since World War II. [[Iran]{.mark} is trading blows
with Israel, [and No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [is sending]{.underline} thousands of
[troops to fight for Russia]{.underline} in Ukraine [while
preparing]{.underline} for war with South Korea and developing [nuclear
missiles]{.underline} that can reach the U.S. mainland. Despite treating
these regimes as enemies, the United States spends only 2.7 percent of
GDP on defense, a level comparable to that of the post--Cold War 1990s
and the isolationist 1930s and well below the Cold War range of six to
ten percent. A military recruitment crisis compounds the shortfall, with
77 percent of young Americans ineligible for service because of obesity,
drug use, or health issues and just nine percent expressing an interest
in enlisting. In a potential conflict with China, U.S. forces would blow
through their munitions inventory in a matter of weeks, and it would
take years for the U.S. defense industrial base to produce replacements.
Rising personnel costs, along with an endless array of peacetime
missions, are stretching U.S. forces thin.

By pairing diplomatic hostility with military unreadiness, the United
States is once again sending the world a mixed signal, a yellow traffic
light. Yellow lights, of course, often prompt aggressive drivers to
speed up. American ambiguity won't matter---until it does, when China,
Iran, North Korea, or Russia decides it's time to take what it has long
claimed by force.

THE DANGERS OF DECLINISM

Since the Soviet Union's collapse, experts have urged policymakers to
prepare for multipolarity, expecting the United States to be challenged
or overtaken by rising powers. But reality has taken a different course.
The United States remains economically dominant while other
contenders---both adversaries and allies---are slipping into long-term
decline. Shrinking populations and stagnant productivity are eroding the
strength of once dominant Eurasian powers. Meanwhile, populous countries
such as India and Nigeria struggle to ascend global value chains because
of poor infrastructure, corruption, and weak education systems.
Automation and the commodification of manufacturing are shutting off
traditional growth paths, leaving many developing countries mired in
debt, youth unemployment, and political instability. Rather than
triggering a rise of the rest, current trends are solidifying a unipolar
world with the United States as the sole superpower, surrounded by
declining great powers and a periphery of middle powers, developing
countries, and failing states.

In the long run, [a [world without rising powers]{.mark} could [foster
stability]{.mark} by [reducing]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} hegemonic
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past 250 years, the Industrial
Revolution caused economies, populations, and militaries to double or
more in size within a generation, sparking intense competition for
resources and territory. But that era is winding down. Shrinking
populations, stagnant economies, and the concentration of wealth in the
United States make the rise of new great powers unlikely. Some analysts
characterize China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia as an "axis," but the
world is unlikely to see a repeat of 1942, when Germany, Japan, and
Italy seized half of the world's productive capacity. Today's fading
challengers lack the strength to overrun Eurasia quickly, and once a
great power falters, it no longer has the population growth to rebound,
as Germany did between the world wars and the Soviet Union did after
World War II. It's hard to imagine Russia, for example, rising from the
ashes of Ukraine to conquer large swaths of Europe. As rising powers
fade, the world may become more stable.

[[But right now,]{.mark} several [threats loom. Declining powers]{.mark}
may [resort to]{.mark} desperate [wars]{.mark} of irredentism [to
reclaim]{.mark}]{.underline} what they believe are ["lost"
[territories]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid slipping permanently into
second-tier status. [[Russia]{.mark} has]{.underline} already done this
[[in Ukraine]{.mark}, and [China]{.mark} might]{.underline} take similar
actions [[in Taiwan]{.mark} or]{.underline} against [the
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline} in [the [S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea. Although [these
conflicts]{.underline} may not match World War II's scale, they
[could]{.underline} still [be ghastly, [involving
nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} threats and [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
on critical infrastructure. [China, No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea, [and Russia]{.underline} face economic and
demographic decline, but so do their most likely
targets---[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}uth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea,
[Taiwan, [and]{.mark} the [Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline}---ensuring
that Eurasia's military balances will [[remain]{.mark} hotly
[contested]{.mark}. Even without sparking massive wars, China and Russia
could]{.underline} gradually transform into gigantic North Koreas,
[rely]{.underline}ing increasingly [on totalitarianism]{.underline} and
military extortion to undermine an international order they can no
longer hope to dominate.

[Another threat is rampant state failure]{.underline}, particularly in
debt-ridden countries with rapidly growing populations. Sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, is expected to add one billion people by 2050, yet
most of its economies are already in fiscal crisis. Manufacturing no
longer provides mass employment, and governments are slashing social
spending to pay foreign loan interest. According to the United Nations,
an estimated 3.3 billion people live in countries where interest
payments exceed investments in either education or health care. The
stagnation of major economies is worsening the situation. A slowing
China, for instance, has halted most of its foreign lending while
reducing its imports from poor countries and flooding their markets with
subsidized exports, delivering a triple blow to their economies.

[A [spiral of state failure]{.mark} could [magnify]{.mark}]{.underline}
a third threat: the continued [rise of
[anti-liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline} in democratic countries. Many
democracies are already struggling with demographic decline, sluggish
economic growth, soaring debt, and ascendant extremist parties. [A
[surge of refugees]{.mark}]{.underline} from failing states [could
further strengthen these]{.underline} antidemocratic movements. After
the Syrian civil war sent more than a million refugees to Europe, for
example, authoritarian parties made substantial gains across the
continent. Liberal democracy has flourished in times of economic
expansion, population growth, and social cohesion, but it's uncertain
whether it can survive an era of stagnation and mass migration.

The United States must contain these threats while continuing to harness
its geographic, demographic, and institutional advantages. A crucial
first step is rejecting the misperception that the country is doomed to
decline. Nearly four decades ago, the political scientist Samuel
Huntington argued in these pages that Americans must fear decline to
avoid it. But fear risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. An
exaggerated sense of decay is already starting to destabilize democracy,
as some Americans lose faith in the system and turn to antiliberal
solutions. Some are rallying behind white nationalism, propelled by
fears of demographic shifts and "great replacement" conspiracy theories,
which falsely claim that political elites encourage mass immigration to
replace white Americans with minorities. Others are stoking minority
grievances to mobilize voters along ethnic lines. Such cynical
strategies have fostered harmful policies, such as defunding the police
or mass deportations, eroding trust in democracy and potentially
enabling demagogues to dismantle the republic's checks and balances.

Fearing decline, the United States might lean toward protectionism and
xenophobia, walling itself off rather than competing internationally,
which would undermine its core strengths. The country has thrived on the
free flow of goods, people, and ideas, soaking up foreign talent and
capital like a sponge and building a global commercial order that
attracts allies. But if the United States embraces a false narrative of
decline, it risks becoming a rogue superpower, a mercantilist behemoth
determined to squeeze every ounce of wealth and power from the rest of
the world. Tariffs, sanctions, and military threats could replace
diplomacy and trade, alliances might become protection rackets, and
immigration could be sharply restricted. This nativist turn might yield
short-term gains for Americans, but it would ultimately hurt them by
making the world they inhabit poorer and less secure. Trade and
[[security networks]{.mark} could [collapse, sparking
resource]{.mark}-driven [conflicts]{.mark} and [killing off]{.mark} any
possibility for cooperation on [nuclear
nonprolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration, [[climate]{.mark} change,
[pandemics, and other]{.mark}]{.underline} global
[[challenges]{.mark}---accelerating a descent into anarchy.]{.underline}

#### Deterrence breakdowns [cause extinction]{.underline} independent of [escalation]{.underline}.

Threaten, Not Save, Humanity," The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2024/01/why-a-nuclear-weapons-ban-would-threaten-not-save-humanity/)

But nuclear weapons are not the only threat to humanity.
[[An asteroid]{.underline}]{.mark} over 1 kilometer in diameter
[striking the Earth, g]{.underline}enetically
[e]{.underline}ngineered [[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logical
[[weapons,]{.mark} super [volcanoes,]{.mark} extreme [climate]{.mark}
change, [nanotech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology,
[[and a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[s]{.underline}]{.mark}uper[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence [[all]{.mark}
could [generate]{.mark}]{.underline} existential harm, whether defined
as the collapse of human civilization or [literal human [extinction. To
address]{.mark} those challenges, [humanity needs]{.mark}]{.underline}
global cooperation to align policies, pool
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, maintain globally critical [[supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark}, build useful technologies, and prevent the
development of harmful technologies. Nuclear
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}---alongside robust international
organizations, laws, norms, alliances, and economic
dependencies---[[helps]{.mark} make [that happen]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Global governments and organizations aiming to reduce existential risks
should support nuclear risk-reduction measures but oppose quick,
complete abolition of nuclear weapons. Nuclear abolition creates serious
risk of returning to an era of [great power
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [could drastically increase
existential risk]{.underline}. A global [war between China, Russia, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and their]{.underline}
respective [allies [risks]{.mark} the survival of the
global]{.underline} cooperative [system]{.underline} necessary to combat
other existential threats, while [threatening [infrastructure necessary
for risk mitigation]{.mark} measures and accelerating]{.underline} other
[existential risk scenarios]{.underline}. As Iskander Rehman wrote in
his recent in-depth study of great power war: "Protracted great power
[[wars are]{.mark} immensely [destructive]{.mark}]{.underline},
whole-of-society affairs, the effects of which typically extend well
beyond their point of origin, spilling across multiple regions and
[[siphoning]{.mark} huge amounts of [personnel,]{.mark} materiel [and
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}... Ultimately, protracted great-power
wars usually only end when an adversary faces total annihilation, or
collapses under the weight of its own exhaustion." If the great powers
collapse, the global system may collapse with them. Nuclear [[deterrence
can]{.mark} help [prevent that]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nuclear weapons place a cap on how bad great power conflict can become
and may deter the emergence and escalation of great power war. If China,
the United States, or Russia faced a genuine existential threat, the
nuclear weapons would emerge, threatening nuclear retaliation. As
Chinese General Fu Quanyou, head of the People Liberation's Army General
Staff until 2002, once said: "The U.S. and Soviet superpowers both had
strong nuclear capabilities able to destroy one another a number of
times, so they did not dare to clash with each other directly, war
capabilities above a certain point change into war-limiting
capabilities." Mutually assured destruction also helps prevent serious
great power conflict from breaking out in the first place. During the
current war between Ukraine and Russia, Russian President Vladimir
Putin has used nuclear threats to deter direct NATO involvement and keep
the conflict local. The United States might wish to support Ukraine
against Russia, but it's not willing to risk a Russian nuclear strike on
New York City or Washington, DC to do more than provide money and
material. Removing that deterrence by banning nuclear weapons means a
potential return to protracted, global great power war.

To emphasize: Opposing quick, complete abolition does not mean opposing
reduction of nuclear arsenals or risk reduction measures like improved
crisis management and ensuring human control over nuclear weapons.
Massive nuclear war is the most likely scenario for existential harm to
humanity in the near term. As the Chinese nuclear arsenal grows, and
China potentially aims for nuclear parity with the United States in the
coming decades, that problem is going to get worse. Current nuclear
weapon strategies depend on targeting adversary nuclear weapons, which
means as an adversary builds more nuclear weapons, the United States
must build more too. If the United States builds more, so too will
Russia and China. Unchecked, nuclear arsenal sizes could quickly spiral
upwards, passing the heights of the Cold War when the United States had
23,000 nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union had 39,000.

The risks of great power war. War among great powers increases
existential risk in at least four ways. First, the global cooperative
system necessary to combat existential threats may be seriously damaged
or destroyed. Second, [[combatants]{.mark} might
[target]{.mark}]{.underline} and destroy
[[infra]{.underline}]{.mark}structure [[and capacity necessary]{.mark}
to implement existential risk mitigation measures]{.underline}. Third,
military necessity may accelerate the development of technologies like
artificial intelligence that create new existential risks. Fourth, a
great power war following nuclear abolition could touch off rapid,
unstable nuclear rearmament and proliferation.

#### Adversaries are [revisionist]{.underline} and have [express intent]{.underline} to [threaten strikes]{.underline} on the US and [proliferate]{.underline} dangerous weapons. 

**Blakley 25**, writer at American Thinker. (Richard Blakley, May 24,
2025, "Trump's Golden Dome," American Thinker,
https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/05/trump_s_golden_dome.html)

It is odd that China would whine that America having a missile defense
system would destabilize the strategic balance in the world.  What about
China's and Russia's deployment of hypersonic missiles? 
[[China]{.mark}'s [and Russia]{.mark}'s]{.underline} deployment of
[hypersonic [missiles was a game changer]{.mark}]{.underline}. 
Hypersonic missiles, using scramjet propulsion, [can travel]{.underline}
faster than [a mile a second]{.underline}.  Their flight
trajectories are very different from ballistic missiles, for [[they fly
low,]{.mark} can [adjust]{.mark}]{.underline} course [mid-flight,
maneuver [around missile-defense]{.mark}]{.underline} systems, [[are
nuclear capable]{.mark}, with some]{.underline} military analysts
[calling them "unstoppable." ]{.underline}

While Biden was asleep at the wheel of the presidency and all the media
were talking about Hunter Biden's trial, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} June
of [[2024 Russia]{.mark}n warships were [conducting]{.mark}]{.underline}
Zircon hypersonic [[missile drills off]{.mark} the [East Coast
of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates with the "U.S. East
Coast...[[within]{.mark} Zircon [range]{.mark}]{.underline}... and the
missiles can... be used [[to strike]{.mark} ground
targets]{.underline}."  This event followed "Putin's warning that
[[Moscow could respond to Ukraine's]{.underline}]{.mark} Western
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} allowing Kyiv to use their weapons to
strike targets in Russia [[by giving similar weapons to
adversaries]{.mark} of the West [worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}." 
Biden's White House responded that this was not a threat, but "it is
symbolic."

Then there is [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[is pressing]{.mark}
forward [to gain a nuclear weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}, with about 275
kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, near weapons-grade, and "the only
country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so."  In
2017 "[[Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark} new naval commander [[vowed to send
warships into America's backyard]{.underline}]{.mark}."  Then in June of
2024 Fair Energy Foundation President Dave Wallace announced on a
podcast that the "inept and feeble" Biden/Harris administration, keeping
it "quiet in the mainstream media," began allowing Iran to move military
vessels into the Gulf of America in February of 2023, showing the
"Islamic Republic's maritime strength." Apparently, [[they were
doing]{.mark} military [exercises in the Gulf]{.mark}]{.underline} until
May of 2023.  The missiles to which Iran has access can "strike up to
1,200 miles away from the Southern Coast of the United States, meaning
[a potential Iranian [strike]{.mark} could reach Minneapolis [from just
off]{.mark} the coast of [Louisiana]{.mark}]{.underline}," and meaning
[Iran could launch a nuclear weapon striking "the heart of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [from the Gulf]{.underline}." 
Iran's military exercises in the Gulf of America were facilitated "using
their ally China's control of the Panama Canal" at the time.

Speaking of China, [China has 3 aircraft carriers]{.underline},
Liaoning, Shandong, and Fujian, and is starting construction on
its fourth carrier, which will have nuclear propulsion.

[Japan had 4]{.underline} fleet carriers [at the start of
WWII]{.underline}.  On June 4, 1942, at the Battle of Midway, over 350
U.S. sailors and airmen lost their lives, and 150 U.S. aircraft were
destroyed, and there was the loss of the U.S. carrier Yorktown, but
miraculously, all four Japanese carriers were sunk turning the tide of
the war in the Pacific.  Over 3,000 Japanese sailors and airmen died. 
According to historian Craig L. Symonds, Japan's loss at Midway
diminished its "ability to project power and defend its territories."

[Does China really need four carriers?  What kind of power does it want
to project?]{.underline}  Remember that [it is not just the
carriers]{.underline} that are [being built, but]{.underline} also [the
accompanying fleet to go with each]{.underline} of them.  Already
[[China has more naval vessels]{.underline}]{.mark} (370 ships) [[than
the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} (295 ships).  China has plans to "build up
to seven carriers by 2049, [the 100th anniversary of the Chinese
Revolution]{.underline} and the year Beijing [is targeting for a
takeover of Taiwan --- by force]{.underline}, if necessary."  At seven
carriers, China will match the number in the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

[So, do [we need]{.mark} a [Golden Dome]{.mark}]{.underline} over
America[?  Is yesterday too soon to start construction?]{.underline}

[[Dismiss scare]{.mark} storie[s about an]{.mark} isolationist
[admin]{.mark}]{.underline}istration [[staffed with]{.mark} unqualified
[loyalists]{.mark} determined [to abandon allies,
start]{.mark}]{.underline} trade [[wars, and sell
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} down the river. An evenhanded assessment of
[the record shows]{.underline} that [[Trump was]{.mark} an
[effective]{.mark}]{.underline} foreign-policy [president, presiding
over]{.underline} a period of relative [global stability]{.underline}
and prosperity, and a second Trump administration promises improved
performance based on the lessons learned in the first term.

You can [expect a capable foreign-policy]{.underline} team that will
bring back an "America First" foreign-policy agenda [[with a focus on
peace]{.underline}]{.mark} through strength, fair and reciprocal trade,
alliance burden-sharing, ending the war in Ukraine, getting tougher [[on
China and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, securing the southern border, and
unleashing U.S. domestic energy potential.

Personnel is policy, and there are many accomplished candidates rumored
to be in the running for top foreign-policy posts in a second Trump
administration, [including]{.underline} former Secretary of State Mike
[Pompeo]{.underline}, former National Security Advisor Robert
[O'Brien]{.underline}, Sen. Marco [Rubio]{.underline}, Sen. Tom
[Cotton]{.underline}, former ambassador to Japan [and]{.underline}
current Sen. Bill [Hagerty]{.underline}, former director of national
intelligence [and]{.underline} former Rep. John [Ratcliffe]{.underline},
and others.

[These are [seasoned pro]{.mark}fessional[s]{.mark}]{.underline} who
have worked with Trump over the years [and [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
more trusted than the so-called [[adults in the
room]{.underline}]{.mark} from the first term. As another former
national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, explains in a new book, [Trump
was burned by]{.underline} previous [cabinet officials, such
as]{.underline} former Defense Secretary James [Mattis and]{.underline}
former Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson]{.underline}, who thought they
knew better than the president and wrongly worked to obstruct his
agenda. Trump rightly wants to avoid that problem this time around.

After all, presidents consider loyalty when hiring staff. National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
for example, are President Joe Biden loyalists who worked with him for
years before being tapped for top posts.

[With a like-minded team]{.underline} in place, [the world can
expect]{.underline} more [policy consistency from Trump 2.0]{.underline}
than in the first term.

[[Contrary to]{.mark} charges of "[isolationism,]{.mark}"]{.underline}
the first [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration pursued a
[globally [engaged]{.mark}]{.underline} foreign policy,
[[in]{.mark}cluding]{.underline} the projection of military force and
[diplomatic energy into [the Mid]{.mark}dle [East and]{.mark} Trump's
personal [diplomacy with]{.mark} the leaders of [all]{.mark} major
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} and adversaries [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[Europe and Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

He [developed [close relations]{.mark}hips [with]{.mark}]{.underline}
some allies, such as then-[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}ese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe. [The [Abraham Accords]{.mark}]{.underline} were a
transformative step forward for Arab-Israeli peace. The [summits [with
Kim]{.mark}]{.underline} Jong Un led to a cessation of North Korean
long-range missile tests for the remainder of Trump's presidency. To be
sure, not all of the diplomatic outreach, such as the trade negotiations
with Chinese President Xi Jinping, led to lasting breakthroughs, but
this extensive personal international engagement belies the notion that
Trump's inclinations are somehow isolationist.

His [[withdrawal from]{.underline}]{.mark} prominent treaties, such as
[the [Iran]{.mark} nuclear deal]{.underline}, known as the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ([[INF]{.underline}]{.mark}) Treaty,
[[were]{.mark} not evidence of isolationism]{.underline} as some wrongly
claim, [but rather [pragmatic]{.mark} judgments]{.underline} that these
agreements were not in America's interest. All the 2016 GOP presidential
candidates promised to pull out of the JCPOA due to its flaws, and it
would have been foolish to remain in the INF Treaty when Russia had
been cheating on the agreement for years.

In defense policy, [you can expect]{.underline} a philosophy of "[peace
through strength]{.underline}," making America so strong that no
adversary dare challenge it, with a willingness to punch back hard when
threatened. In his first term, Trump presided over the largest defense
budget in U.S. history at the time; successfully prosecuted the war
against the Islamic State; bombed Syria after Syrian dictator Bashar
al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people; and killed the
coordinator of Iran's terror and proxy networks, Gen. Qassem Suleimani.

A major increase in defense spending will be necessary for the United
States and its allies to counter the new axis of autocracies (China,
Russia, Iran, and North Korea) at the same time, but the Biden
administration defense budgets have not kept up with inflation. Under
Trump, expect an increase in defense spending (perhaps proposing the
first \$1 trillion U.S. defense budget) and a concerted effort to revive
the defense industrial base, including a focus on the Trump priority of
a homeland missile defense system, an "iron dome," for the United
States. As the bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission
recently recommended, Washington should build a missile defense system
to defend itself from North Korea, China, and Russia.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have restrained U.S. and allied
militaries to avoid "escalation" in ongoing conflicts; a Trump 2.0
administration should be more willing to use force decisively when U.S.
interests are threatened.

In international economics, Trump will prioritize fair and reciprocal
trade that benefits the American people. He will impose tariffs to
counter unfair trading practices and to generate leverage for
negotiations. His threat of a 10 percent across-the-board tariff is the
opening bid in the next round of talks. Trump was criticized for
imposing sweeping tariffs on China, but now everyone follows his lead.
Biden maintained and added to Trump's restrictions on trade with China,
and even Europe and Brazil have recently imposed high tariffs to counter
the oversupply of Chinese-made electric vehicles. A Trump 2.0
administration will accelerate global efforts to secure supply chains
and achieve strategic independence from China.

In [Europe]{.underline}, those focused only on rhetoric [claim that
[Trump was tough on allies]{.mark} and deferential to]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}. The underlying [policy
tells a different story. Trump]{.underline} broke from the Obama
administration in providing lethal aid to Ukraine for the first time.
[[He also bolstered]{.mark} U.S. military [forces on NATO's]{.mark}
eastern [flank]{.mark}]{.underline}. He privately [[warned
Putin]{.mark} not to invade Ukraine]{.underline}. He built two new
nuclear weapons to deter Russia and killed hundreds of Russian
mercenaries on the ground in Syria. His administration [[brought]{.mark}
new [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, Montenegro and North Macedonia,
[[into NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trump increased American spending on
European defense, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} his stern words on
[burden-sharing]{.underline} helped prompt European defense spending
increases that [[strengthened the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In a second term, he will continue to demand that allies step up, saying
recently that NATO should increase its defense-spending target from 2
percent to 3 percent of GDP. This is a necessary and important step as
European defense officials tell me that it will take a target closer to
3.6 percent to actually provide the capabilities needed to implement
NATO's new regional defense plans.

[[On Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, he has been clear that he wants to
end the war quickly. He plans to use promises to provide or withdraw
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as leverage. He said he will tell
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate or else he'll cut
off military assistance. Trump also said, "I would tell Putin, if you
don't make a deal, we're going to give \[Zelensky\] a lot. We're going
to give \[Ukraine\] more than they ever got if we have to." [[If Putin
refuses]{.mark} to negotiate, [Trump could]{.mark}]{.underline}
conceivably [[provide]{.mark} Ukraine with more]{.underline} advanced
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} with fewer restrictions on their use. [If
he is successful in]{.underline} forcing a [negotiation]{.underline},
his strategy [could [force a]{.mark}]{.underline} near-term
[[cease-fire]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly along the current lines.

### 1AC\-\--Air Incursions

#### Advantage two is [AIR INCURSIONS]{.underline}:

#### They are [increasing now]{.underline}\-\--domain [awareness is key]{.underline}. 

**Dress 23**, reporter at The Hill, citing Kari Bingen, the Director of
the Aerospace Security Project at CSIS, and Jon Gruen, the CEO of Fortem
Technologies (Brad Dress, February 15, 2023, "How China's spy balloon
spurred a rapid shift in US sky patrol," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3859855-how-chinas-spy-balloon-spurred-a-rapid-shift-in-us-sky-patrol/)

[[UFOs]{.mark} flying [through]{.mark} U.S. [airspace are not
new]{.mark}]{.underline}, with eyewitness accounts and photographs of
strange aerial craft dating back decades. 

While before there was a stigma in reporting these sightings, the U.S.
government is now taking them seriously, and Congress recently passed
legislation to form a new office to investigate what officials now refer
to as unidentified aerial phenomenon.

But the spy balloon and the subsequent UFO takedowns this month
accelerated scrutiny around the [flurry of strange objects buzzing
across the sky.]{.underline}

A leading theory from the White House is that the UFOs were deployed for
commercial or benign purposes, which has led to some head-scratching
over why the U.S. was not already aware of the source of the objects.

Kari Bingen, the director of the Aerospace Security Project at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the U.S. "needs to
get to the bottom of this" and enhance data collection and sharing.

"The intelligence community has been very stove-piped in how they treat
data," Bingen said. "Do they have data that can be brought to bear and
then objects ruled out or taken off the table? Do allies and partners
have information that could be useful? I think a lot of that, that
piece, there really needs to be attention."

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a binational
agency serving both Canada and the U.S. that operates from a
headquarters at Peterson Air Force base in Colorado, is responsible for
monitoring the skies above the continent.

The agency employs a network of satellites, ground-based radar, airborne
radar and aircraft to detect and respond to any potential threats. 

NORAD primarily works from three regional operations at Elmendorf Air
Force Base in Alaska, Canadian Forces Base in Winnipeg and Tyndall Air
Force Base in Florida.

After the hefty Chinese spy balloon was taken down off the coast of
South Carolina, NORAD commander Gen. Glen VanHerck admitted that [at
least [four]{.mark} previous spy [balloons had flown over]{.mark} the
U.S. [undetected]{.mark}]{.underline} and were only discovered
retroactively. 

VanHerck called it [[a]{.mark} "domain [awareness
gap]{.mark},"]{.underline} raising concerns [the U.S. [lacked]{.mark}
the [ability to track]{.mark} balloons or other surveillance
devices.]{.underline}

Intelligence [officials]{.underline} then [detected]{.underline} the
past three [[UFOs]{.underline}]{.mark} last weekend after tweaking the
radar system to scan more closely at lower altitudes and for [[balloons
and]{.mark} other]{.underline} less conspicuous [[flying
objects]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There were two previous issues with radar detection, according to
analysts in the airspace field. 

The first is the military was looking for specific threats, such as
missiles or long-range bomber planes, typically at higher altitudes. The
second is when scanning at higher altitudes, the radars were not tuned
to find flying objects like balloons.

In order to analyze wide swaths of objects flying at different
altitudes, [[NORAD might need]{.underline}]{.mark} an adjustment, such
as deploying [a [greater]{.mark} number of [detection
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} or more powerful ones. 

Jon Gruen, the CEO of Fortem Technologies, a company that develops
systems to counter drone incursions and works closely with the Defense
Department, compared it to a flashlight: You could shine a narrow beam
that can see up to 20 feet, or a wider beam that can see for up to 10
feet but capture more area.

"What [we are realizing]{.underline} right now is [there needs to be
greater air awareness systems]{.underline} tracking at different
altitudes at different ranges to see smaller objects," Gruen said.
"[[We're seeing]{.underline}]{.mark} simple [[balloons and]{.mark}
airborne [platforms]{.mark}]{.underline} tripping in [[from all
different]{.mark} types of [locations]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's
changing, so we've got to adapt to those changes."

[Yet [even with satellite tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [surpassing
some abilities of balloons]{.underline}, James Char, a research fellow
with the China Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies in Singapore, tells TIME that [spy [balloons
have]{.mark}]{.underline} some operational
[[advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, balloons [[can weather
extreme conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, he says, and [[are less
expensive]{.mark} to deploy and operate]{.underline} compared to
satellites. Chinese Academy of Science scholars found in 2020 that,
despite harsh environments at more than 68,000 feet above ground,
"[the]{.underline} high-altitude [balloon [has long endurance]{.mark}
time, [which can achieve sustained]{.mark}]{.underline} and wider
[[coverage for]{.mark} regional [observation]{.mark}]{.underline} and
detection."

["It is [harder to be spotted by radar]{.mark} as well]{.underline},
given the fact that they're simpler in terms of technology," Char adds.
U.S. officials admitted the balloon flying over North America this week
was first spotted by civilians on a plane.

High-altitude [[balloons can]{.mark} also [be "trucks
for]{.mark}]{.underline} any number of [platforms]{.underline}, whether
it be communication and data link nodes, ISR, tracking air and [[missile
threats]{.mark} --- and [without]{.mark} the [predictable orbits]{.mark}

On January 28, a large balloon launched by China flew into the U.S. Air
Defense Identification Zone north of the Aleutians. It then traveled
through Alaska and western Canada. The balloon, carrying what appeared
to be surveillance equipment, crossed into Idaho on January 31.

Before an Air Force F-22 shot it down on Saturday afternoon off the
South Carolina coast, [the]{.underline} maneuverable [balloon
[surveilled]{.mark}]{.underline}, among other facilities, Malmstrom, F.
E. [Warren, and Minot Air Force Bases, which house [Minutemen]{.mark}
III]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The balloon [also]{.underline} passed close to Whiteman Air Force Base,
home to [[the]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline}-capable [[B-2]{.mark} bomber
[fleet, and]{.mark}]{.underline} Offutt Air Force Base, the
[headquarters of [Strat]{.mark}]{.underline}egic
[[Comm]{.underline}]{.mark}and, [which controls U.S. nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[[This path suggests]{.mark} China is gathering
[intel]{.mark}]{.underline}ligence [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} either [[a
first]{.underline}]{.mark} or second [[strike]{.mark} on America\'s
nukes.]{.underline}

Whatever China is planning, the violation of American territorial
airspace was blatant and [reveals the dangerous mentality of the Chinese
leadership.]{.underline}

There are several alternative explanations for why Beijing engaged in
such a brazen act. It is possible that the Chinese military has become
so politically powerful inside the Communist Party that it could launch
this balloon without consulting others.

A more likely possibility is that China\'s leader decided this was the
time for China to make its move. \"Xi Jinping seeks to affirm his warped
vision that the United States is a weak and indecisive power in decline
that will be crushed by an ascendant triumphant China under his
leadership,\" Charles Burton of the Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier
Institute told Newsweek. \"That U.S. citizens could look up into the sky
and see China\'s spy balloon looking down on them may have been
gratifying to Xi and his cohorts.\"

Jonathan Bass, a China expert at InfraGlobal Partners, tells this
publication that [the provocative balloon [flight occurred at]{.mark}
the [same time]{.mark} that [Beijing adopted]{.mark} a more
[assertive]{.mark}]{.underline}---and counterproductive---[[posture in
G]{.underline}]{.mark}ulf [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ooperation
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ouncil [[countries]{.mark}. \"I think Xi
Jinping has [just told]{.mark} all of China\'s [diplomats
everywhere]{.mark} that [now]{.mark} is the time]{.underline} for them
[[to move against America]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he said.

Why at this time? For one thing, Xi is being criticized for domestic
policy disasters and so may be seeking wins to change the conversation
in Beijing. He has no one else to blame, so he needs to distract his
adversaries in senior Communist Party circles.

Many are worried. Take General Mike Minihan. The chief of the Air
Force\'s Air Mobility Command predicted, in a memorandum to his command
leaked January 27, that [America would be in a war with China \"in
2025.\"]{.underline}

\"While General Minihan\'s assessment of 2025 is in the ballpark for
public U.S. government source estimates, the more stark reality is that
the People\'s Liberation Army will have a relative superiority over U.S.
forces in East Asia for another two to three years, so [[Xi]{.mark}
Jinping [could]{.mark} decide to [start]{.mark} his [war]{.mark} almost
[any time]{.mark}]{.underline},\" said Richard Fisher of the
Virginia-based International Assessment and Strategy Center to Newsweek.

the Real Nuclear Threat,"

[[Arithmetic]{.mark} alone [makes a]{.mark} compelling [case for
surprise]{.mark} attack [being]{.mark} the most [likely]{.mark}
scenario]{.underline} because, as shown earlier, [[it is]{.mark} by far
the [most effective]{.mark} way]{.underline} of attacking the Triad.
[[All]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[bombers]{.mark} could [be destroyed
on]{.mark} their [bases,]{.mark}]{.underline} two-thirds of missile
[[submarines]{.mark} destroyed [in port, and]{.mark}]{.underline}
surprise is the best hope for [destroying [ICBMs before]{.mark} they
[launch]{.mark}]{.underline}-on-warning. Once U.S. bombers are generated
and dispersed, once SSBNs are generated and all at sea, once ICBMs have
strategic warning that they may be attacked---all will be much harder to
destroy.

Adversary Nuclear Doctrine and Strategic Posture

[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[doctrine
puts]{.underline}]{.mark} even more [[emphasis on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the importance of [[striking]{.mark} first]{.underline}, achieving
surprise and preemption, than did Soviet doctrine. 70 Moscow's strategic
posture relying so heavily on ICBMs (even Russian SSBNs are armed with
ICBMs that can be launched dockside) appears designed for surprise
attack.

[China's]{.underline} "No First Use" pledge, like the Soviet [NFU
pledge]{.underline} during the Cold War, [is]{.underline} almost
[certainly fictional]{.underline}. China's strategic posture, bereft of
early-warning satellites and radars, logically should push Beijing
toward nuclear first use, early in a crisis or conflict. China must "use
them or lose them" based on strategic warning. China's rapidly building
inventory of MIRVed mobile ICBMs and SLBMs looks like imitation of
Russian preparations for nuclear blackmail and warfighting.71

North [[Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} as soon as it developed a small
number of ICBMs began a campaign of nuclear blackmail and
[[made]{.underline}]{.mark} numerous unprovoked [[threats]{.mark} to
strike the U.S.]{.underline} and its allies. At a recent parade North
Korea displayed a new SLBM and what appears to be the world's largest
mobile ICBM, that could possibly be MIRVed.72 At the parade, dictator
Kim Jong-Un declared: "We will continue to strengthen war deterrence for
self-defense to deter, control and manage all dangerous attempts and
threatening acts, including ever-growing nuclear threats, from hostile
forces. But should anyone undermine our national security and mobilize
military power against us, I will retaliate by using the most powerful
offensive force at our disposal and in a preemptive manner."73

U.S. Warning And Execution Vulnerabilities

The U.S. array of technical and operational safeguards to verify and
react appropriately to an incoming nuclear attack minimizes the
possibility of accidental nuclear war, but potentially increases
vulnerability to surprise attack:

\--The U.S. before launching ICBMs, or any nuclear forces, requires
"dual phenomenology" to confirm enemy nuclear attack is incoming or
underway, such as satellite and radar confirmation or actual nuclear
detonations.

\--NORAD and SPACECOMMAND must "threat conference" before warning the
President that an enemy nuclear attack will be arriving in a few
minutes.

\--The President must select a nuclear strike option and authorize its
execution through an Emergency Action Message.

\--EAMs must be communicated to the forces.

\--Before launching, ICBMs and SLBMs, which are normally "detargeted" to
strike broad ocean areas as a safeguard against accidental execution,
must be re-aimed at targets.74

[[Hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} warhead[[s]{.mark}, EMP [and
cyber]{.mark}-attacks [could defeat]{.mark}]{.underline} this highly
time-compressed chain of [[early warning]{.underline}]{.mark} and
execution [until]{.underline} enemy [nuclear detonations occur, when it
will be too late]{.underline}. He who strikes first in a nuclear war
will most likely win---[[Russia, China,]{.mark} and
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [[know
this]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Vulnerability Of U.S. Strategic Culture

The greatest U.S. vulnerabilities to surprise attack are psychological:

\--Denial of nuclear surprise attack likelihood, believing nuclear war
most likely would occur in the context of severe crisis or conflict
providing strategic warning, so the U.S. can generate its forces to a
survivable posture.

\--[A strategic [culture]{.mark} so [conditioned to fear]{.mark} the
"unthinkable" and averse to [appearing]{.mark}]{.underline} to be
[[a]{.mark} nuclear ["alarmist"]{.mark} that even the
defense]{.underline} and intelligence [communities will fail to
warn.]{.underline}

[History suggests]{.underline} the intelligence community will fail to
provide strategic warning and be surprised, even amidst [a
crisis]{.underline} or major war, as in Japan's surprise attack on
[Pearl Harbor]{.underline} in 1941, North Korea's surprise [invasion
of]{.underline} South [Korea]{.underline} in 1950, North Vietnam's
surprise [Tet Offensive]{.underline} in 1968, [and]{.underline} the
surprise terrorist attacks of [9/11]{.underline}/2001.

The U.S. has never fully generated strategic forces, not even during the
1962 Cuban missile crisis.

Even the anti-nuclear Union of Concerned Scientists admits that, if U.S.
ICBMs are de-alerted as they recommend, although they can be re-alerted
merely by throwing a switch---concerns over escalating a crisis may
prevent ICBM generation:

"The United States should immediately remove its ICBMs from high alert,
which can be done quickly by using the existing safety switch in each
silo. It should also eliminate from military plans the option of
launching on warning of attack, which would preclude the option of
re-alerting the missiles. Re-alerting would be particularly risky during
a time of crisis."75

While ICBMs are on high-alert and so always generated, generating
bombers and SSBNs is highly visible and potentially provocative, which
probably explains why the Triad has never fully generated.

Despite the best laid plans of defense and intelligence community
professionals to provide strategic warning "indicators" that are
supposed to generate U.S. forces to a survivable posture, countervailing
views within these communities will counsel against force
generation---and often even against strategic warning---fearing these
will escalate a crisis.

Failures To Warn And Generate The Triad

Perhaps most importantly, because U.S. strategic culture is conditioned
to regard nuclear war as "unthinkable"--- and most "unthinkable" a
nuclear surprise attack---U.S. intelligence and defense communities will
almost certainly not believe even clear indicators of a possible
impending surprise attack:

\--During the NATO theater nuclear exercise ABLE ARCHER-83, the USSR
prepared Soviet nuclear forces to preempt what Moscow mistakenly
believed was an impending U.S. nuclear surprise attack. Despite clear
indicators, the U.S. intelligence community failed to warn and the Triad
did not generate. Subsequently, a great debate raged within the
intelligence community over the failure to warn that lasted seven (7)
years, but did nothing, could do little, to correct a strategic culture
blind to the threat of nuclear surprise attack.76

\--During the August 1991 failed coup d'etat against Soviet Premier
Mikhail Gorbachev, led by the General Staff and KGB chief Vladimir
Kryuchkov, who were true believers in the Surprise Nuclear Missile
Attack (VRYAN) program, the General Staff put Soviet nuclear forces on
Increased Combat Readiness to detect and preempt an impending U.S.
surprise attack. The U.S. intelligence community failed to warn. 77 I
personally witnessed a senior CIA officer breakdown in tears during the
crisis, defending the failure to warn the President and Joint Chiefs as
a "higher duty" to avoid U.S. Triad generation that might escalate into
nuclear war.

\--During the October 1993 failed coup d'etat against Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, while fighting raged in the streets of Moscow, the
General Staff launched a major nuclear strategic forces "exercise" that
included, for the first time, generating all of their dozen Airborne
Nuclear Command Posts. Simultaneously, Russia disclosed to the New York
Times their secret "Dead Hand" (officially "PERIMETR") system that would
automatically launch Russian ICBMs to defeat a U.S. nuclear surprise
attack. 78 I was at Peterson AFB at the time, briefing a
NORAD/SPACECOMMAND audience comprising hundreds of analysts on nuclear
scenarios. Some of us thought these alarming developments warranted
Triad generation, but most dismissed the generated Russian posture as
"nuclear sabre rattling" and mere "bluster." The U.S. Triad did not
generate.

\--On January 25, 1995, in response to false warning that a Norwegian
meteorological rocket was a U.S. SLBM, the leading edge of a nuclear
surprise attack on Russia, for the first time all three Chegets
(Russia's equivalent of the U.S. presidential "football" for authorizing
nuclear strikes) activated for President Yeltsin, General Pavel Grachev
(Defense Minister), and General Mikhail Kolesnikov (Chief of the General
Staff). It was the most dangerous moment in the nuclear missile age, an
accidental nuclear war averted only because President Yeltsin refused to
"push the button" and waited until the rocket fell harmlessly into the
sea. The U.S. intelligence community was unaware of these perilous
events until President Yeltsin publicly disclosed them afterwards. Many
in the U.S. defense and intelligence communities drew exactly the wrong
conclusion, complacently arguing that Russia's "system worked" for
avoiding nuclear war.79

\--In 2017, North Korea successfully demonstrated ICBMs that could
strike the United States, detonated an H-bomb they described as capable
of "super-powerful EMP attack" and displayed an H-bomb ICBM warhead,
flew missiles over Japan, and made repeated unprovoked threats to strike
the U.S. and allies. Reportedly, General James Mattis (then Defense
Secretary) "generated" himself for a North Korean nuclear attack by
having emergency communications available in his car, in his bedroom,
and sleeping dressed to go.80 But the press and policymakers were
allowed to believe that the North Korean nuclear threats were mere
"bluster." The U.S. Triad never generated.

If Russia or North Korea struck the United States during any of the
nuclear close calls described above, or during any of many other
incidents, some described in my book War Scare: Russia and America on
the Nuclear Brink, they would have caught the U.S. Triad ungenerated in
a "bolt from the blue" surprise attack. It matters not that U.S.
intelligence and defense communities are aware of rising tensions,
nuclear indicators, or even if a conventional world war is raging (as
prior to Pearl Harbor)---if despite these warnings, the U.S. nuclear
Triad is not generated to a survivable posture, the enemy can
successfully execute a nuclear surprise attack that will have the same
destructive effect as if a "bolt from the blue."

Education Center, BA from Vanderbilt University, MA from the University

Disorder in the Middle East," Occasional Paper,
https://npolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2202-John-Spacapan-Middle-East.pdf)

This monograph project began about two years ago to address a
comparatively more pedestrian challenge than winning great power
competition: A future with multiple states in the Middle East pointing
nukes at one another seems more likely today than it ever has before.
This monograph still focuses on this problem, however, over the last two
years, and especially in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
the Arab States' response to it, it became clear this project does more
than just talk about nuclear weapons. It outlines the tenets of an
organizing principle to guide Western states toward a more coherent
Middle East policy. The most concrete manifestation of Middle Eastern
states' insecurity and distrust of the West is the collective explosion
of interest in building robust nuclear programs. If Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, or another Arab state built the bomb, they would no longer need
to rely on the United States, London, or their friends. Most states in
the region already have far more robust economic relations with Beijing
than with Washington, in part because China has a greater need for
Middle Eastern oil and gas than does the United States. Armed with the
bomb, Western security guarantees, arms sales, and bases would become
much less meaningful to Riyadh, Ankara, or any other friendly capital.
[A nuclear Middle East would]{.underline} not only [bring the world
exponentially closer to nuclear war]{.underline}, but it would hand the
keys to the region to the Beijing-Moscow axis.

Last year, revelations in Western media that Saudi Arabia secretly
developed a nuclear program, [[with China's help]{.underline}]{.mark},
opened eyes in the West. But [the truth is, Saudi Arabia is not without
company]{.underline}. The three most powerful states in the region --
[[Iran, Turkey, and Saudi]{.mark} Arabia -- [are all increasing]{.mark}
their [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other regional players
-- [[Egypt and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab [[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates --
[[are]{.mark} doing so [as well]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But can Washington stop the spread? Some insist nuclear weapons
proliferation is inevitable in the Middle East. Why expend time and
valuable resources toward an unachievable goal? Iran cannot be stopped
from acquiring a nuclear weapon, it has been argued, only slowed down.
If impoverished states like Pakistan in the 1990s and China in the 1960s
acquired a weapon, then any determined state can and will acquire one
too.

Perhaps this is true, but the United States and like-minded nations have
slowed the spread of nuclear arms, even in the Middle East. This
suggests nonproliferation should still be quite possible. One example of
success is Algeria. Near the beginning of its second civil war in 1991,
Algeria built a nuclear reactor with China's help. In now declassified
National Security Council memos, intelligence officials noted the
reactor was large enough to be used to make plutonium, which is a fuel
for nuclear bombs, but an uneconomic fuel for civilian power
generation.8 There were suspicions Algeria had a facility to extract
this plutonium from the reactor's spent fuel.

Finally, the entire nuclear facility was protected by an anti-aircraft
missile system, which is abnormal for a strictly civilian power plant.
The US government during the George H.W. Bush Administration acted on
this information and applied pressure through various channels until
Algeria foreswore acquiring nuclear weapons and placed the reactor under
IAEA safeguards.

Other examples include Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The United States, Great
Britain, and Israel destroyed suspect nuclear facilities in Iraq and
Syria. Moammar Qaddafi's Libya famously gave up its nuclear weapons
program in 2003 after secret negotiations with the Administration of
George W. Bush.

Much earlier, during the tumultuous days of the Cold War, several Middle
Eastern states entertained going nuclear. Turkey considered it in 1960,
only to abandon plans later for various reasons, as this volume will
discuss in section two. Egypt under President Gamal Abdul Nasser pursued
multiple reactor projects, only to see the funding dry up after the
Six-Day War, and the incentives evaporate after Nassar's successor Anwar
Sadat began working toward a peace agreement with Israel. International
pressure (including by the US) led Sadat to sign The Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1980. Evidence suggests
even today's most likely nuclear proliferators in the region -- Iran,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia -- have craved the bomb for decades, to varying
degrees. As of today, none of them have nuclear arms.

Again, all of this real-world history indicates that theoretical
arguments about what is considered inevitable should not control what
policymakers do now.

This study will explain how the United States and like-minded states can
still stop, or at least significantly slow down, the bomb's spread in
the Middle East. The historical record as well as the current intentions
of potential proliferators in the region suggests this is possible, but
Washington will need to start planning now. The three case countries of
this monograph -- Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- are all taking
aggressive steps toward nuclearization.

This study's first section argues that further [[spread]{.mark} of
nuclear weapons would cast a dark shadow over the Middle
East]{.underline}. The section outlines the three most plausible nuclear
proliferation scenarios; (1) several states obtain the bomb, (2) several
states develop robust nuclear fuelmaking capabilities (as Iran already
has) but decide to remain a few months away from acquiring a nuclear
weapon, and (3) Iran, or another state, gets the bomb and other states
go right to the edge of weaponization. All three futures [[could
catalyze]{.mark} conventional inter-state [conflicts and]{.mark} growing
[proxy fights]{.mark} that could become more dangerous]{.underline}
direct conflicts. [[Even if wars were]{.underline}]{.mark} somehow
[[avoided]{.mark}, the]{.underline} ability of America and like-minded
states to promote economic and [political [stability]{.mark} in the
region [would]{.mark} dramatically [decline]{.mark}. Thankfully, none of
this is inevitable]{.underline}. The second section outlines how
economic, technical, security, and domestic political factors have so
far prevented states in the region from acquiring the bomb and the third
section explains why today's three most worrisome proliferators -- Iran,
Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- remain nonnuclear weapons states.

[So far, Middle Eastern states have failed to acquire nuclear weapons
because]{.underline} they faced three barriers. First, [Western states
blocked Middle Eastern states from getting the bomb]{.underline} through
coercive measures such as military strikes and economic sanctions, and
through re-assuring measures such as basing troops in the region,
selling advanced weaponry, and signing security agreements. Second, most
Middle Eastern states have not been certain they needed the bomb.
Nuclear weapons are useful to deter conventional foreign invasions, 9
not the domestic political instability -- revolutions, coups, and other
forms of regime change -- that plague most Middle Eastern states. Third,
Middle Eastern states have struggled to execute nuclearization because
of technological barriers and more pressing military imperatives that
required immediate focus and funding. The case of Israel (the one Middle
Eastern state with a nuclear arsenal) validates these findings.

Not only was its nuclear pathway not blocked by Western states, but its
security decision makers were convinced they needed the bomb to prevent
annihilation by Arab states. Unlike its Middle Eastern neighbors, Israel
had steady access to funding and scientific research that was not
constrained by more pressing security prerogatives.

From the vantage point of Riyadh, Ankara, and Tehran, the barriers are
starting to look more and more as they did to Israel in the 1950s.
Today's most likely proliferators have become less certain that Western
states will or can stop them from going nuclear. They are less confident
in security guarantees and agreements signed with Washington and its
allies. They have easier access to funding and nuclear scientists than
in the past. They face long-term security anxieties rather than
immediate existential threats -- a recipe that drove Israel and other
states to invest in nuclear weapons programs.

The fourth section suggests an alternative approach to policy in the
Middle East. Specifically, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and Western allies [[should]{.mark} seek
to build a]{.underline} sustainable [coalition of]{.underline} both
[Middle Eastern]{.underline} and Western [states]{.underline} that
provides more security and prosperity to its participants than
nuclearization ever could.

[Agreeing to form a coalition would [rebuild trust among]{.mark} Middle
Eastern [states]{.mark} that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its Western allies [will not abandon the Middle
East]{.underline}. It would create a forum for Arab leaders to express
concerns and grievances and for Western leaders to respond. It would
allow Middle Eastern states to have a greater voice in determining
Washington and its allies' role in the region. It would help states in
the region build more capable conventional militaries, as NATO did in
Ukraine, and prepare for a fast-approaching world fueled without oil.

In Washington, fostering a coalition in the Middle East dedicated to
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons could be a sustainable approach
that Republicans and Democrats alike would support. It would help
clarify why Washington remains committed to the region. It would help
anchor Western engagement in the region in a time when Russia and China
are challenging the West's influence. It would lead Western states
toward a more consistent approach to the region, which Middle Eastern
leaders are desperate to see. Over time, a coalition model would promote
greater peace and prosperity than the current model of piece-meal
policy.

Section 1

What proliferation headaches are coming in the Middle East?

Section 1 Introduction

If we consider the three most likely nuclear proliferators in the Middle
East -- Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey -- we can identify at least three
commonalities; (1) each of their leaders is talking about acquiring
nuclear weapons, (2) each of these states is currently building nuclear
programs, and (3) they all have incentives to get the bomb. If the
current trajectory continues, it is likely that one of three
unacceptable scenarios will play out.

One: Iran, or theoretically Turkey, Saudi Arabia, or another Arab state
gets the bomb and the others do not. Two: Two or more states in the
region develop robust nuclear programs but decide to remain a few months
away from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Three: Iran and at least one other
state in the region acquires nuclear weapons.

In each case, the threat of conflicts in the region would increase.
Whoever got the bomb (especially Iran) would conduct conventional or
proxy attacks with impunity.10 There is a history of new nuclear-weapons
states acting more aggressively soon after acquiring the bomb. Israel
presumably acquired nuclear weapons shortly before its surprise attack
against Egypt's air and land forces in 1967, launching the Six-Days War.
Not long after acquiring nuclear weapons in 1964, Mao's China nearly
triggered a major war with the Soviet Union. Chinese soldiers killed
dozens of Russian troops on Zhenbao Island, and both sides massed forces
along the RussoChinese border. Pakistan has been every bit as aggressive
against India since Islamabad proved it had a nuclear arsenal in 1998.
In 1999, it sent paramilitary forces into Indian-controlled Kashmir,
resulting in a two-month conflict that resulted in about one thousand
deaths.11 In the years since, India and Pakistan have been on the brink
of major war several times. Pakistan has facilitated terrorist attacks
that have killed hundreds and injured thousands in India. In Iraq,
Saddam Hussein told his commanders that the bomb would allow him to
attack neighbors with impunity.12 All of this suggests that if Iran or
another state acquired nuclear weapons, the threat of conflict would
increase.

[The threat of [conflicts turning nuclear would be real]{.mark}. While
[some]{.mark}]{.underline} political scientists have [[theorized]{.mark}
that the [spread]{.mark}]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [[makes wars
less likely]{.underline}]{.mark}, responsible [policymakers [ought not
test that]{.mark} theory [in the]{.mark} politically [volatile Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 During the Cold War, the United States and
the Soviet Union nearly commenced nuclear war on a number of occasions.
14 The Cuban Missile Crisis is one obvious example. A few times, it was
by accident, despite both superpowers' large nuclear security
bureaucracies and safety mechanisms. On one occasion, a Soviet
junior-level officer heroically chose to ignore radar indicating the
Americans had launched a full-scale nuclear strike.15 [In the Middle
East, [new]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline} weapons [[states]{.mark} would
probably [lack]{.mark} the organizational [controls]{.mark} of
established nuclear powers, [making accidents]{.mark} more
[likely]{.mark} than they were in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates or Soviet Union.16

[If states in the region went nuclear, the [risk of]{.mark} nuclear
[arms falling into]{.mark} the hands of [terrorists]{.mark} or
irredentists [would increase]{.mark} substantially]{.underline}. Three
Jihadi-fueled [[civil wars]{.mark} are raging]{.underline} in the Arab
World and other Arab states have struggled to control their own
territory. [Turkey had [a coup]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2016. Iran has
had [large, violent [protests]{.mark}]{.underline} in every major city
since 2019 -- [another [revolution is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}
there in coming years.

#### AND even [absent a first strike]{.underline}, credibly [threatening one]{.underline} causes [Taiwan to fall]{.underline} AND [Chinese EMPs]{.underline}\-\--destroys the grid.

[The Chinese surveillance [balloon]{.mark}]{.underline} shot down by the
U.S. Air Force on February 4 [[traveled over a]{.mark} U.S.]{.underline}
intercontinental ballistic missile [([ICBM]{.mark}) base [and]{.mark}
one [bomber base]{.mark}, collecting info]{.underline}rmation about U.S.
nuclear facilities. Some commentary states that the United States took
countermeasures to prevent the [transmission of data back to
China]{.underline}, meaning that the violation of U.S. airspace and
sovereignty was "not a major breach" of U.S. security. Yet others,
including Senators Steve Daines and John Tester and Representative Matt
Rosendale, believe the Chinese balloon incursion was a serious
problem and need to be prevented in the future. 

What information China was able to gather with a balloon that it could
not obtain through satellite surveillance is unclear, but other
important questions need to be answered. What is the Chinese purpose in
the strategic realm? What does this mean for China's modernization and
expansion of its nuclear arsenal?

The collection of weather information about a U.S. Minuteman III missile
field would tell the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) how its warheads
might fare in seeking to destroy U.S. missiles, a point made by a very
detailed assessment in 1984. 

An additional study eleven years ago discovered the Chinese build of
tunnel-based mobile railroad launchers for their land-based ICBMs. The
range of the DF-31 ICBM is estimated at 7,000-11,000 kilometers, meaning
it can hit anywhere in the United States, including Malmstrom, F.E.
Warren, and Minot Air Force Bases. 400 American ICBM missiles are
deployed at these three American missile bases, and China's nuclear
buildup is allowing Beijing to hold the entire U.S. ICBM force at risk.

Especially with China's construction of 360 additional ICBM launchers or
silos in western China, the CCP's objective is becoming clearer. These
silos can contain DF-41 ICBMs that carry up to ten warheads each, with a
12,000-kilometer range. Despite doubts to the contrary, China's
expanded fissile material production capabilities are now confirmed by
U.S. intelligence assessments. The People's Republic of China (PRC) can
turn out nuclear warheads like sausages, building up to at least 1,500
warheads by 2030-35, according to recent U.S. intelligence reports. This
"breathtaking" buildup, as described by the recently retired commander
of U.S. Strategic Command, Admiral Charles Richard, is dramatically
changing the security environment that the United States is operating
in.

Indeed, on February 7, U.S. Strategic Command notified the U.S.
Congress, as required by law, that [China now has more ICBM launchers
than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. This should concern
Americans, especially given rising U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan and
Beijing's acknowledgement that its "no first use" policy does not
apply to the island. Look no further than the statement from Chinese
state media that threatened to use nuclear weapons against Japan, and
"again demand their unconditional surrender" as occurred in World War
II, if Tokyo decided to come to the defense of Taiwan. 

[[With
n]{.underline}]{.mark}o-[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}irst-[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}se
[[jettisoned,]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. assessments of [[Chinese]{.mark}
nuclear strategy [might]{.mark} begin to]{.underline} include the idea
that up to 360 DF-31 or DF-41 missiles in those 360 silos [could very
well [unleash]{.mark} multiple thousands of warheads in [a]{.mark}
potential [first strike]{.mark} against the U]{.underline}nited

in China's mind, [[could ensure]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[stands down in]{.mark} the case
of]{.underline} PRC aggression against [[Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

The Chinese balloon entered U.S. airspace undeterred. If one is not
concerned with multiple thousands of Chinese warheads holding at risk
U.S. military capabilities and major American cities, one might
contemplate Mike Pillsbury's testimony before the U.S.-China Security
Review Commission that warned [[China could]{.underline}]{.mark} use
electromagnetic pulse weapons [([EMP]{.mark})]{.underline} against
[[the]{.mark} U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [electrical
[grid]{.mark} with catastrophic results]{.underline}. And what is a very
efficient and surreptitious method of bringing an EMP weapon over
America's heartland? As the late EMP expert Dr. Peter Pry
explained numerous times, [[a key means of delivering]{.mark} such a
weapon [would be a balloon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Civilization relies on]{.underline}]{.mark} a network of [highly
[interdependent critical infra]{.mark}structure (CI) [to
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} basic [necessities ([water, food]{.mark},
shelter, basic goods), [as well as]{.mark}]{.underline} complex items
(computers, cars, space shuttles) and services (the [[internet,]{.mark}
cloud]{.underline} computing, global [[supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark}), henceforth referred to as industry.
Electricity and the electrical infrastructure that distributes it plays
an important role within industry, providing a convenient means to
distribute energy able to be converted into various forms of useful
work. Electricity is one component of industry albeit a critical one.
Industry provides the means to sustain advanced civilization structures
and the citizens that inhabit them. These structures play a critical
role in realizing various futures by allowing humanity to discover and
utilize new resources, adapt to various environments, and resist natural
stressors.

[[Though]{.mark} industry is [capable of resisting small stressors,
a]{.mark}]{.underline} sufficiently [[large event]{.mark} can
[precipitate cascading failure of CI]{.mark} systems]{.underline},
resulting in a collapse of industry. If one does not temporally discount
the value of future people, the long-term future (thousands, millions,
or even billions of years) could contain an astronomically large amount
of value \[18\]. [Events [capable of]{.mark} curtailing the potential of
civilization]{.underline} (existential risks, [such as human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} or an unrecoverable collapse) [would
prevent such futures from being achieved]{.underline}, implying reducing
the likelihood of such events is of the utmost importance \[100\].

[[risks]{.mark} factor[s]{.mark}]{.underline}; events, [systemic
structures]{.underline}, or biases which increase the likelihood of
extinction but do not cause extinction by themselves [[is]{.mark} also
[highly valuable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Complete
[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} or degraded function [[of industry
would]{.mark} drastically [reduce]{.mark} humanity's [capacity
to]{.mark}]{.underline} coordinate and [[deploy tech]{.mark}nology [to
prevent existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, representing an
existential risk factor. Consequently, interventions preventing loss of
industry, reducing the magnitude of impacts, or increasing speed of
recovery could be extremely valuable.

#### Taiwan invasion causes a litany of [existential risks]{.underline} AND ensures [totalitarian]{.underline} world [governance]{.underline}. 

**Easton 23**, MA, Senior Director at the Project 2049 (Ian Easton,
2023, "If Taiwan Falls: Future Scenarios and Implications for the United
States," in The World After Taiwan's Fall, Issues & Insights Volume 23
Series 2, pg. 10-12,
https://pacforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Issues_and_Insights_Vol23_SR2.pdf)

By seizing Taiwan, the PRC would have effectively carved out a sphere of
influence for itself in Asia using violent methods. This invasion would
have grave implications for international law, the ideal of national
self-determination, and the principle of state sovereignty. [The [fall
of Taiwan would]{.mark} undermine]{.underline} perceptions of
[U.S.]{.underline} global [diplomatic and military
leadership]{.underline}, straining (and possibly
[[break]{.underline}]{.mark}ing) [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} American
[[alliance system and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ations System. [China would be]{.underline}
viewed as [the most powerful nation]{.underline} in the world and the
primary mover of the 21st century. Leaders would experience trepidation
as Beijing marched [toward]{.underline} its vision of [a
new]{.underline} centralized, [authoritarian world order.]{.underline}

[[Nuclear arms racing would]{.mark} start and]{.underline} could easily
[[rapidly spiral]{.mark} out of control]{.underline}. The likelihood of
World War Three breaking out could climb higher than anything previously
seen. It can be expected that the world would begin sliding toward the
brink of an abyss, and human civilization would risk being knocked
backward in its developmental story. Abstract ideas like
[i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline} and universal values
[would increasingly appear quaint, even]{.underline} faintly
[ridiculous]{.underline}. This would be a new age of empires; [might
would]{.underline} once more [make right.]{.underline}

In such circumstances, [[Japan could]{.mark} be expected to [go
nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} and become heavily militarized. Tokyo would
likely be in the grip of a profound sense of insecurity
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} disillusionment with U.S. defense guarantees.
It is possible that Japanese politics could [swing in a]{.underline}
right-wing, [authoritarian direction.]{.underline} Alternatively, it is
possible that far left-wing politicians could gain power, and Japan
might end up band wagoning with China. In either event, there would be
an increasing risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country
could experience a wave of political violence. [Over time, it
may]{.underline} even be possible that Japan would [[become a
dictatorship]{.mark}.]{.underline}

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [[So]{.underline}]{.mark}uth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [[would]{.mark} likely [go nuclear
and]{.mark}]{.underline} attempt to save their nation from takeover by
building an independent deterrent force. South Korea may
[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} an even [[deeper]{.mark} domestic
political [crisis]{.mark} than Japan]{.underline}. It seems likely that
the [Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other]{.underline} Southeast
[Asia nations]{.underline} that are currently hedging their bets would
conclude that they had no choice but to align themselves with Beijing
against the United States.

[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be emboldened]{.mark}
by]{.underline} a successful Chinese [invasion of Taiwan
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} reconsider long-dormant plans to weaken and,
if possible, destroy South Korea's government and affect a
[[takeover]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[the peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}.
With the power and prestige of the United States drastically reduced and
South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems probable that North Korea would
seek to obtain China's help in attacking South Korea. Beijing is likely
to see the situation as an opportunity to drive American forces off the
Asian mainland. China's government would probably encourage and support
some degree of North Korean aggression. At a minimum, an unprecedented
campaign of coercion would likely result, [[which]{.mark} could
[escalate to war]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, [CCP
influence]{.underline} over Pyongyang [would grow]{.underline}, and
North Korea would struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the
new PRC empire. [[India would]{.underline}]{.mark} almost certainly see
the loss of Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly [expand
its]{.mark} nuclear weapons [arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} and further
build up its conventional military along the border. With Taiwan gone,
[the PLA would]{.underline} likely [focus on re-taking territories
controlled by Delhi]{.underline} as its next major mission.
[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark} will fear being encircled and isolated
as the Chinese military pushes across the South Pacific. Canberra
[[might]{.mark} opt to [develop]{.mark} its own]{.underline} independent
[[nuclear arm]{.underline}]{.mark}ament[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} program
and accelerate plans to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad
would be at a distinctive crossroads; it may become the foundation for a
collective security organization like NATO, but it could just as easily
fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. [With the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates distracted
[humiliated]{.underline} by China, NATO countries might rally together
in common cause and redouble their efforts to bolster collective
security. It seems at least as probable, however, that the post-war
bonds that have long tied together [the great
[democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} of Europe [[would
fray]{.underline}]{.mark}. Combined [Chinese and [Russian
influence]{.mark} campaigns might [succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} in
getting countries such as Germany, France, and Italy [[to]{.mark}
embrace pro-Beijing policies that]{.underline} drive them against the
United States and [fatally [fracture]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} alliance network. [European [disunion might
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}, throwing the continent into a political
environment eerily reminiscent of the 1920s and 1930s.

With the PRC on the march and global geoeconomics in a downward spiral,
fragile governments in the developing world could topple in large
numbers, leading to cascading waves of seething political violence and,
in several countries, devastating famine and starvation. Fascist,
Communist, and Islamist [[dictatorships]{.mark} would [emerge]{.mark}
across Eurasia, Africa, and]{.underline} South [America]{.underline}.
Even European [countries]{.underline} with moderate-to-high Human
Development Index (HDI) scores [might be at risk of being [overtaken
by]{.mark} radical [populist]{.mark}]{.underline} impulse[[s]{.mark}
driven by]{.underline} the spreading [economic despair]{.underline}.9
[The [CCP would]{.mark}]{.underline} seek to exploit the unstable
environment as an opportunity to [rapidly [spread]{.mark} its model of
[totalitarian governance]{.mark}, create a]{.underline} global [network
of proxy governments, and fundamentally transform the world
order.]{.underline}

#### Totalitarian world governance causes [nuclear wars]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Belfield 23**, Research Associate and Academic Project Manager at the
University of Cambridge\'s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk
(Haydn, "Collapse, Recovery, and Existential Risk," in *How Worlds
Collapse: What History, Systems, and Complexity Can Teach Us About Our
Modern World and Fragile Future*, p. 74-76)

A [world dominated by [totalitarian states]{.mark} would be]{.underline}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone, less cooperative, and]{.mark} more
[inhibitive of progress than]{.mark}]{.underline} one dominated by
[[democratic states]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our current world is not
particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or progressive---a
totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [It would increase the risk
of]{.underline} another collapse and [extinction and could shape the
future toward less desirable trajectories]{.underline} (Beckstead,
2013).

[[Totalitarian]{.mark} states are]{.underline} incompetent. They are
[[bad at forecasting]{.mark} and dealing with disasters]{.underline}
(Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen most clearly in the great famines of
Communist China and the USSR, in which millions died (Applebaum, 2017;
Becker, 1996; Dikotter, 2010; Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning
multiparty democracies rarely, if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010).
"Established autocracies" (or "personal"/"sultanist") are particularly
bad, as there are few checks or restraints on arbitrary rule and the
whims and ideology of the single individual, even from other elites
(Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the "inner circle" around Mao, Stalin,
and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic, with elites strongly incentivized
to conceal information and encouraged by the autocrat to squabble and
feud---so they are divided (Conquest, 1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang &
Halliday, 2006). [If totalitarian states are worse at addressing social,
environmental, and technological problems]{.underline}, then [a world
dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to [risks]{.mark}
of]{.underline} collapse and [[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have [major
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. States with near-universal adult suffrage
rarely (if ever) go to war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so
a world dominated by democracies has fewer wars.
[[Miscalculation]{.mark} might be a [particular problem for
totalitarian]{.mark} states [due to personalization]{.mark} and
disincentives for accurate information]{.underline}, leading to
well-known strategic disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in
World War II (Bialer, 1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller
level, Saddam Hussein's rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [War
makes collapse and extinction more likely, by]{.underline}
[[raising]{.mark} the [chance of w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction being used]{.underline}.

Linked to this, [totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.underline}
than democratic states. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg, 2020),
their internal norms are characterized by paranoia and treachery, and
their lack of transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to
agreements. [This is bad for [all risks]{.mark} that [require
cooperation such as pandemics]{.mark} or [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik, 2015).

Finally, [continued social and scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.underline} collapse and [extinction]{.underline}. Social
progress could [reduce global inequality and other risk factors.
Scientific progress could]{.underline} help [address natural risks and
climate change]{.underline} (Sandberg, 2018), [differentially increase
defensive rather than offensive power]{.underline} (Garfinkel & Dafoe,
2019), [and solve safety challenges in [AI or
biotechnology]{.mark}]{.underline} (Russell, 2019). However, as we will
now discuss [totalitarian states would]{.underline} likely [inhibit
social progress]{.underline}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy. Second, they have within themselves the
mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50) years, the
lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and non-white people
have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has expanded, and could
continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the moral universe is
long, but given the right conditions, it might just bend toward justice
(King, 1968). A global society dominated by these values, and with the
possibility of improving more, has a better longterm potential. A
totalitarian-dominated world, on the other hand, would reduce the space
for resistance and progress---distorting the human trajectory.

[We should be particularly concerned about "[bottlenecks]{.mark}" at
which values [are]{.mark} particularly
[important]{.mark}---[where]{.mark} there is a [risk of
"locking-in"]{.mark}]{.underline} some particular set of (possibly far
from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently far-off,
[future technologies [such as a]{.mark}rtificial [g]{.mark}eneral
[i]{.mark}ntelligence,]{.underline} [[space]{.mark} settlement, [life
extension]{.mark} (of autocrats), [or]{.mark} much better
[surveillance]{.mark} could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan,
2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[A long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated world [would]{.mark}
extend the period of time humanity would spend with a heightened [risk
of]{.mark} collapse or [extinction]{.mark}, as well as increased
potential for]{.underline} distortion of the human trajectory and the
possibility that a "[lock-in]{.underline}" event may occur. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," resulting in a
trajectory with less or no scientific and social progress and a less
favorable geopolitical situation, which would threaten the destruction
of humanity's longterm potential.

[[would]{.mark} also [end any hope of]{.mark} the situation

[[billions]{.mark} of people would [be stuck]{.mark} in a terrible

#### AND [air incursions]{.underline} destroy US [credibility]{.underline} and resolve\-\--causes [war with China]{.underline}. 

**Herman 23**, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, PhD in History
from John Hopkins, BA from the University of Minnesota (Arthur Herman,
February 14, 2023, "Balloons, Biden, and American Power," Hudson
Institute,
https://www.hudson.org/national-security-defense/balloons-biden-american-power)

The fact is, [[we've not had]{.mark} a [robust air defense]{.mark}
system]{.underline} over the United States [since the Cold War, [and the
Chinese know it]{.mark}]{.underline}. They have also assumed that an
administration that tolerates 2 million illegal border
crossings annually isn't going to respond effectively to a spy balloon
during its leisurely voyage from the Aleutian islands across the western
United States, pausing to gather data from US nuclear weapons bases,
before drifting along to the Atlantic coast. 

Now, after failing to act decisively in the spy balloon case, the White
House has been scrambling to restore credibility with serial shootdowns
of anything, balloons or otherwise, that drift over our national
territory. The American people and Congress, however, aren't fooled.
They sense something wrong with the Biden administration's approach to
this entire problem. 

That something is about where we are today, as a superpower. 

The Germans have a word for it, Machtfrage, or the power question.
Herman Kahn, the father of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War with
the Soviet Union, described it as "a question whether a nation is in
fact a great power or merely has the trappings of one. If the nation
does not adequately meet the challenge of a Machtfrage, further testing
and a serious loss of prestige and status are likely to ensue."

[[The balloon]{.mark} incident [has become]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[a
test:]{.mark} Are we ready [to act like a great power]{.mark} or
not?]{.underline} Are Americans willing to take the necessary steps to
reassert their presence as the world's superpower and to boldly stand up
to the China threat to our national interests, and the threat to freedom
more generally, or do we prefer a more modest role in the world---one
that ultimately surrenders the control of our fate to others?

Although they would never say it, I suspect the Bidens and
[[many]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats [[are content]{.mark} with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[becoming
a]{.underline}]{.mark} second or even [[third-class
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. That way they can forget all this
competition with China nonsense and get on with building their green
socialist utopia---and enriching themselves, Al Gore-style, in the
process. In their view, our wide-open borders and deaths from fentanyl
are the inevitable collateral damage as we drift along toward the
American sunset.

This is not to let Republicans off the hook. They need to rethink their
position on the Machtfrage, as well. There are too many in Congress and
elsewhere who want to take the same resigned attitude, of withdrawing
the US from the world stage and letting others deal with the
geopolitical challenges from China, Russia, and Iran. 

[The [problem is]{.mark}, trying to surrender our status as [the]{.mark}
world's leading superpower won't make us safer]{.underline}. As Kahn
concluded, "A nation which fails a Machtfrage test...must be prepared to
defend its interests by actual use of military force. [The [more
prestige]{.mark}]{.underline}, status, reputation, and credibility [that
have been [lost, the greater]{.mark} the [need to rely on actual
force]{.mark}]{.underline}." In short, [[resigning]{.mark} ourselves to
second-power [status makes]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark} with
China more [likely]{.mark}, rather than less, whether it's
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline} Straits, [[the
S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, [or]{.underline} even [over the skies of
[Alaska and]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Americans need to
know that, [before they allow]{.underline} our leaders to let [the baton
of]{.underline} global [leadership slip into]{.underline} the hands of
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping and Beijing, no matter how many
balloons we shoot down in the meantime.

#### US-China war causes [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Stares 23**, General John W. Vessey Senior Fellow and Director of the
Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations (Paul
B. Stares, February 2023, "Averting Major Power War: The Logic of Mutual
Assured Survival," Council on Foreign Relations, Discussion Paper Series
on Managing Global Disorder No. 12,
https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/Averting%20Major%20Power%20War.pdf)

[The imperative to avert]{.underline} such a [conflict cannot be
overstated. A [major]{.mark} power [war]{.mark} has the potential to
become a catastrophe of world-historical proportions]{.underline}. While
much would depend on the duration of such a clash, whether it remained
confined to a specific region, and most crucially, stayed [below the
nuclear threshold, the scale of death and [destruction could]{.mark}
very possibly [be]{.mark} of an [unprecedented]{.mark}
magnitude]{.underline}. Hundreds of thousands and potentially
[millions]{.underline} of people [could die]{.underline}.5 [[Vast
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} of the zone of conflict [would be [laid to
waste]{.mark}. The shock and disruption to the global
economy]{.underline} of even a limited clash [would]{.underline} also
[be immense and]{.underline} probably [prolonged]{.underline} given how
tightly intertwined trade and investment have become from decades of
globalization. [No country would be spared. And should such a war become
global and unlimited]{.underline} in scope, the harm to the planet and
[the [very existence of life]{.mark} would [be
imperiled]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
[[irredeemably]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Among the major powers, the United States is arguably the most exposed
to the risk of becoming embroiled in a war with another major power.
Given its unrivaled set of security commitments that span the globe and,
more generally, its role as the principal defender of the current
"rules-based international order," the United States is more predisposed
than any other power to use force to resist territorial aggression,
uphold established rules and norms of international behavior, and
maintain open access to the "global commons"---essentially, the high
seas, outer space, and cyberspace. Those commitments increase the
likelihood that [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [could find itself
[fighting]{.mark}]{.underline} either [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} or
Russia---and conceivably both at the same given their growing security
ties. No other power stands to lose more should a major power war result
in defeat and, with it, the potential demise of the global order the
United States has worked so hard to build and nurture over many decades.
All this assumes, of course, that humanity survives a conflagration of
this magnitude.

The Joe Biden administration---following its predecessor---has adopted
what is essentially a "peace through strength" strategy to deter and
defeat potential Chinese and Russian aggression through the maintenance
of countervailing military power in coalition with like-minded partners
around the world.6 This strategy has attracted broad bipartisan support,
no doubt because many policymakers view it as having succeeded in
keeping the peace during the Cold War.7

American power and resolve were crucial to the eventual triumph of the
West during the Cold War. But it came at a high price: an extraordinary
amount of national resources were expended on developing weapons and
keeping forces at high levels of readiness to maintain mutual deterrence
over the course of more than four decades. The human costs incurred
fighting numerous proxy conflicts across the globe were also
significant. As the current U.S. strategy has taken shape, however,
there has been remarkably little reflection on the experience of the
Cold War---in particular, whether adopting similar policies today could
have comparable consequences in the future.8 The lack of such
forethought is all the more egregious given there are good reasons to be
concerned that the new era of major power rivalry will have attributes
that make it more dangerous than the U.S.-Soviet confrontation.

[[Even if]{.mark} the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline} excesses and extreme
[[dangers]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Cold War era [[can be avoided,
there is still]{.mark} the [question of how]{.mark}]{.underline} the
major [[powers]{.mark} will [cooperate on]{.mark} a range of pressing
[threats to humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}---not least the accelerating
effects of [[climate]{.mark} change,]{.underline} the possibility of
[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} deadlier than COVID-19, [[and]{.mark}
the emergence of [malignant]{.mark}]{.underline} forms of
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence---while relations between them grow
more hostile. This dilemma too has not received the attention it
deserves. The presumption seems to be that common interest will
transcend mutual mistrust allowing cooperation to proceed without
hindrance on a parallel track. The historical record, however, is not
encouraging that this will be so straightforward. And to the extent
there are precedents for cooperation between strategic rivals, they
arguably do not match the level and scope of what is now required.

[The timing could not be more dangerous. [China]{.mark} has]{.underline}
changed strategic direction and has [been building its nuclear
stockpile]{.underline} and delivery systems. China [also]{.underline}
has continued to develop [hypersonic weapons]{.underline}, including
stand-off  "carrier killers," [space]{.underline} weapons [and
cyber]{.underline} capabilities to blind opponents' strategic and
conventional systems. [[Russia]{.mark} has been advertising]{.underline}
(mostly for domestic consumption, but nonetheless worrying)
[its]{.underline} "unstoppable" delivery systems, and has a very capable
[nuclear stockpile]{.underline} and military. [[Iran]{.mark} will
continue]{.underline} to move forward with [building nuclear weapons.
[Pakistan]{.mark} and [India]{.mark}]{.underline} both have significant
nuclear capability [in an increasingly unstable]{.underline} part of the
world. Nuclear-armed [[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [is again]{.underline} assuming a more
[belligerent]{.underline} posture. [[Israel]{.mark} has a full nuclear
triad]{.underline} (land, air, subs) to respond to existential
aggression. [The [U.K. and France have]{.mark} significant [nuclear
deterrents. The world is a powder keg]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

In Hollywood terms, today's capacity for nuclear holocaust is thousands
of times greater than the era portrayed in the Armageddon films "On the
Beach," "Fail Safe," or "Dr. Strangelove." There would not be anything
left for "Mad Max." Climate disasters may be unfolding over the next
hundred years. Nuclear disaster is unfolding now. COVID-19 has killed
more Americans than the flu typically does. [Nuclear [war could kill us
all]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our leaders must get their priorities
straight.

[The [danger lies in]{.mark} the growing global [perception of
weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} and incompetence in the Biden
administration, combined with claims of the politicized weakening of the
FBI, CIA, State Department and Defense Department. This has crystallized
in Secretary of State Antony Blinken's unsure Anchorage meeting with the
Chinese, Biden's wooden Geneva summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin, the
colossal failure of the Afghan withdrawal, which may devolve into a
humiliating hostage crisis for America, and the budget- and
inflation-based defunding of Defense. In addition, the fully politicized
Intelligence and Armed Services committees on Capitol Hill add to the
danger. Our enemies may decide that now is the time to move. 

It would be a huge miscalculation.  

Catastrophic mistakes at this scale often unfold when isolated events
light [powder kegs]{.underline}, which then [inexorably explode into
global conflict.]{.underline}  

[An incident in Sarajevo lit a powder keg of nationalistic, economic and
ambitious personality struggles]{.underline} in Europe to unleash World

self-confident [P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation
[A]{.underline}rmy [[pushing for]{.mark} the use of military

ineffective U.S. response, [leading to]{.mark} the [sinking]{.mark} of

list of potential [[doomsday scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}s is
endless.  

[[The one]{.mark} powerful [factor holding back such
miscalc]{.mark}]{.underline}ulations [[has been coherent U.S.]{.mark}
foreign policy and [resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}, combined with
pragmatists in Moscow and Beijing. But in the past six months, the
world's confidence in the U.S. leadership has begun to slip. An
agonizing hostage crisis would make it even more dangerous. Added to
that is the potential that a stubborn and wounded U.S. administration
might overreact to try to show its strength. The U.S. has devastating
countermeasures for all enemy strategies, and an enemy underestimating
that power, combined with a White House trying to prove itself, could be
disastrous. 

#### AND air incursions cause [disease-from-above]{.underline} and [weather weaponization]{.underline}.

Balloon Missions Be Even More Sinister Than Aerial Spying?" The
Aviationist,

The memes are funny. The headlines are fascinating. But the real concern
about last week's Chinese balloon incident is more than hot air. Chinese
[[balloon]{.underline}]{.mark} operation[[s over]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[pose a genuine]{.mark} strategic
[risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. And this risk extends [beyond]{.underline}
the possibility of [gathering intel]{.underline}ligence [about U.S.
missile bases]{.underline}. What if the two Chinese balloons tracked
across the western hemisphere last week could have been weaponized?
History and literature suggest [the concern over weaponized balloons has
merit.]{.underline}

Historical precedents of [weaponized balloons
[carrying]{.mark}]{.underline} everything from [incendiary weapons to
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}-infested fleas exist. And perhaps [more
ominously]{.underline}, recent activity in China suggests that
significant advancements in [[weather modification]{.underline}]{.mark}
-- that [[could be delivered by balloons]{.underline}]{.mark} -- have
been recently deployed. While some of this analysis has the feel of
crackpot conspiracy theory, the facts show that [high altitude balloons
pose a genuine strategic threat as a plausible weapons delivery
system]{.underline}.

In December, 2020, Bloomberg.com reporter Adam Minter wrote,
"[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} announced [[plans to expand]{.mark} its
[rainmaking]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [[to cover]{.mark} nearly
60% of [the country]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2025. Details are sketchy,
but fears are rising about the potential [[military uses]{.mark} of
these capabilities]{.underline}, and their effects on an already
changing climate." Minter's report was fascinating, even though he
didn't connect the dots to [[include]{.underline}]{.mark} mention of
[weather modification [being delivered by]{.mark} long
range]{.underline}, high altitude [[balloons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Three years ago, when Minter reported on [Chinese [efforts to seed
clouds]{.mark}]{.underline} to moderate a regional drought, concern over
Chinese balloon overflights had not yet gone viral. But his report
recognized the [[potential for]{.underline}]{.mark} weaponizing the
ability to control weather, [potentially creating [floods]{.mark} and
[mudslides]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a capability easily delivered
by high altitude balloons. More than half a century before this, in a
July 3, 1972 expose', The New York Times special reporter Seymour M.
Hersh wrote about the formerly top-secret U.S. weaponized rain making
efforts in Laos, Cambodia, North and South Vietnam. Hersh reported that,
"The United States has been secretly seeding clouds over North Vietnam,
Laos and South Vietnam to increase and control the rainfall for military
purposes. Government sources, both civilian and military, said during an
extensive series of interviews that the Air Force cloud seeding program
has been aimed most recently at hindering movement of North Vietnamese
troops and equipment and suppressing enemy antiaircraft missile fire."

I've lived through disease outbreaks, and in the previous chapter I
showed just how unprepared we are to face a widespread pandemic of flu
or another new pathogen like SARS. But [a [deliberate outbreak]{.mark}
caused [by]{.mark} an [engineered pathogen]{.mark} would be far
worse]{.underline}. We would face the same agonizing decisions that must
be made during a natural pandemic: whether to ban travel from affected
regions, how to keep overburdened hospitals working as the rolls of the
sick grew, how to accelerate the development and distribution of
vaccines and drugs. To that dire list add the [terror]{.underline} that
[[would spread]{.underline}]{.mark} once it became clear that the death
and disease in our midst was not the random work of nature, but a
deliberate act of malice. [We're scared of disease outbreaks and we're
scared of terrorism---put them together and you have a formula for
[chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As deadly and as disruptive as a conventional bioterror incident would
be, an attack that employed existing pathogens could only spread so far,
limited by the same laws of evolution that circumscribe natural disease
outbreaks. But [a virus engineered in a lab to break those laws [could
spread]{.mark} faster [and kill quicker]{.mark} than anything that would
emerge out of nature]{.underline}. It can be designed to evade medical
countermeasures, frustrating doctors' attempts to diagnose cases and
treat patients. If health officials manage to stamp out the outbreak, it
could be reintroduced into the public again and again. [It could,
[with]{.mark} the [right]{.mark} mix of genetic [traits]{.mark}, even
[wipe us off the planet, making]{.mark} engineered [viruses a]{.mark}
genuine [existential threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Albedo hacking is]{.underline} itself [destabilizing]{.underline}, in
the sense that its effects on regional climate, particularly with regard
to precipitation versus temperature, are disparate. [A contentious
[world]{.mark} is likely to [get embroiled in disputes]{.mark} over
[which climate is right for which]{.mark}]{.underline} country, but in a
deeply interconnected system like the climate system, [it is [impossible
to solve]{.mark}]{.underline} one country's problem without making
different problems for another country. For example, [[what if
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[prefers]{.mark} a]{.underline}
more [[ice-free]{.mark} Arctic? [What if]{.mark} the
[albedo]{.mark}]{.underline} modification [deployment that saves
Beijing]{.underline} from killer heat waves [[causes failure in]{.mark}
the [Indian monsoon?]{.mark}]{.underline} For these things to be
problems, it is not even necessary for feared effect to be real -- if
some climate-related damage is merely perceived to be the effect of
[albedo hacking]{.underline}, it [will be a cause for
contention]{.underline}, since the current state of climate modeling and
the international justice system would make it exceedingly difficult to
adjudicate such issues.

In the debate over the risk of abrupt termination, the availability of
easy countermeasures that a dissenting country could deploy against
albedo hacking facilities has been largely ignored. The two main
proposed means of injecting aerosol-forming substances into the
stratosphere make for easy and high-profile targets. Lumbering
high-altitude aircraft would be ripe pickings for fighter jets or
surface-to-air missiles, and the political consequences of shooting them
down would be reduced by the fact that they would most likely be drones
operating over international waters in the tropics.

Another seriously proposed scheme employs a hosepipe reaching from the
ground to the stratosphere, suspended by balloons -- a 16-kilometer high
floppy tower, in effect. Imagine what [an attractive
[target]{.mark}]{.underline} that would be [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
geoengineering dissenters, or even for [apocalyptic [terrorist
groups]{.mark} aiming to just create chaos]{.underline} for human
society. And there are other kinds of countermeasures. If Russia doesn't
like the restoration of Arctic sea ice by albedo hacking, all it has to
do is to pump massive amounts of the potent and long-lived greenhouse
gas sulfur hexafluoride into the atmosphere -- or simply just dig up and
burn more coal. The increased greenhouse effect would have to be
countered by increased albedo hacking, and you can guess where that
might end. [[To]{.mark} the resurgent terror of [nuclear war,]{.mark} we
would [be adding]{.mark} the new terror of [climate
wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 1AC\-\--Golden Dome

On 27 January 2025, President Donald [[Trump signed]{.mark}
an [E]{.mark}]{.underline}xecutive
[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rder (EO) directing the US Department of Defense
[[to build a]{.mark}n "Iron Dome for America,"]{.underline} which is
[short]{.underline} hand [for a]{.underline} next-generation [missile
defense shield for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates (and
[since rebranded]{.underline} as [the "[Golden
Dome]{.mark}"]{.underline}). "Over the past 40 years, rather than
lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become
more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer
adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland
integrated air and missile defense capabilities," the EO noted. Although
skeptics have questioned the cost and technological feasibility of an
Iron Dome, [the need to defend]{.underline} North America [against
ballistic, hypersonic,]{.underline} advanced [cruise missiles, and
other]{.underline} next-generation [aerial attacks]{.underline} from
peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries [is now a US priority. Time is
ticking.]{.underline} The deadline for the Secretary of Defense
to submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based
requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile
defense shield is 60 days, meaning three scalable options must be
proposed by 28 February 2025, with RFIs ambitiously anticipated for 2026
and beyond. 

Many will think of Israel's 10 Iron Dome batteries which can cover
approximately 150 km (60 miles) to guard against missiles launched from
relatively short ranges. Israel also has other systems (David's Sling,
Arrow System, and THAAD), which together form a system of systems to
protect 9,402,617 people and 21,937 sq km of land. An Iron Dome for the
United States will be on a scale, size and level of complexity to deal
with the myriad different missile threats (and their trajectories,
flight paths and delivery systems) that will stretch the capabilities of
engineers, scientists and the military. [[The system could
cover]{.underline}]{.mark} North America, including Canada, its [[Arctic
and Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, protecting over 380 million people and
more than 19 million sq kilometers. [[However,]{.mark} for [this]{.mark}
current [iteration]{.mark} of the EO, the Iron Dome [will]{.mark} likely
[concentrate on the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates; [[the EO is clear]{.mark} that [it
is]{.mark} the Iron Dome [for America]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
technical necessity for comprehensive space-based architecture and
additional costs for systems to cover the entire continent of North
America is beyond the current defense directive. The EO hints, however,
at a role for allies and partners noting "Increase\[d\] bilateral and
multilateral cooperation on missile defence technology development,
capabilities, and operations" (Section 4a) is required. Canada, (and
other allies) will have important parts to play.

US Admiral (ret.) James Stavridis, the former Supreme Allied Commander
of NATO, recently outlined the three elements of a successful "Iron
Dome": space-based sensors and interceptors; artificial intelligence to
fuse and analyze information; and the ability to design, build, and
implement a new method of destroying incoming missiles including with
lasers. 

The clarion call to protect North America has been made by successive
Commanders of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and
US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The goal of militaries is to have
all-domain awareness and defense of North America, informed by sensors
from seabed to outer space, that support deterrence by
denial.  Deterrence by denial aims to change the calculus of adversaries
by permitting North America to see as far away as possible, in time and
space, to give the Commander information dominance and decision
superiority. In other words, if North America can detect potential
threats earlier, governments have more options to respond, especially
options that do not involve force. Iron Dome could fundamentally reshape
how the United States thinks about defense and re-define current
integrated air and missile defense systems but answers about what to
defend and from what need to come first.

There are, however, eye-watering costs, not to mention logistical and
engineering issues that will need to be tackled. Rather than one system
to cover all of North America, it is more likely to be many systems in
many domains to deal with different missile threats that protect the
continental United States at the early stages and expand from there with
individual, likely ground-based and aerial systems, for Canada and
Alaska. 

[Missile [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} and modernizing early warning
[systems [in the]{.mark}]{.underline} North American [[Arctic are
complicated by]{.mark} the [lack of]{.mark} persistent]{.underline}
satellite communications [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} above 60
degrees latitude. [[Today's effective]{.mark} missile defense [systems
are extremely
info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation-[[intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
future versions will only be more so. One of the reasons the F35 is so
hotly anticipated in Canada is because it is a data and information
vacuum, but managing such information flows requires new communications'
capabilities. Technical issues posed by the Arctic location include
frequent low cloud cover, aurora effects, maintaining a stable power
supply, thermal management for optics, ice formation, protecting
sensitive optical components, and complex atmospheric turbulence,
amongst many others.  Adequate supply chains and industry capacity are
other challenges.

[Strategically, [the Arctic is a]{.mark} future, [critical portion
of]{.mark} the [Iron Dome]{.mark}, especially for cruise
missiles]{.underline} given that the shortest avenue of approach for
many adversaries' delivery systems is over the Arctic. Analysts have
wrestled with missile defense for decades, including the US Missile
Defense Agency, US Strategic Command, NORAD and US Northern Command, US
Space Force (and component commands), and Defence Research Development
Canada's missile defense research programs. 

Canada, which contributes to and benefits from its longstanding
bi-national North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) with the
United States, shares these concerns and has committed to help address
them through NORAD modernization programs, including promises to enhance
its military footprint in the northern approaches to North America.
NORAD warns of incoming missiles, but USNORTHCOM makes decisions with
respect to which if any to defeat using its Ground Based Midcourse
Defense (GMD) System optimally oriented to defeat intercontinental
ballistic missiles from North Korea or Iran but cannot manage the large
and more sophisticated Russian and Chinese missiles. NORAD's North
Warning System (a series of short- and long-range radars) and [[future
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and Polar Over the Horizon Radar [[systems
will be essential sources of info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation; the
latter two will be [[able to see far beyond]{.mark} North America and
[into the Arctic and]{.mark} the [Greenland]{.mark}-Iceland-UK
[gap]{.mark}]{.underline}.  A firm commitment to contribute to Iron Dome
is an important shift in policy for Canada to make given its "no" to
participation in GMD in 2005.

Perhaps the most important strategic consideration is how [[the]{.mark}
pending]{.underline} deployment of [[Golden Dome would affect]{.mark}
potential [arms control]{.mark} negotiations with Russia and
China]{.underline}. Unlike many of President Trump's policies, homeland
missile defense is something Russia hates and views as a direct
threat to its sovereignty. China has also expressed deep concerns about
US missile defense, in part because it undermines the buildup of its
nuclear forces currently underway. [[Days after Trump signed the]{.mark}

#### Arms control stops existential [nuclear war]{.underline} and bans [FOBS]{.underline}.

Institute at Stanford University, former Deputy Secretary General of

America Should Pursue Parallel Nuclear Negotiations With China and
Russia," Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/arms-control-not-dead-yet#)

Nearly every week since taking office in January, U.S. President Donald
Trump has had something to say about [controlling [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. In comments to Fox News in March, for
example, he referred to these weapons as "big monsters" and [the world's
"greatest existential threat,"]{.underline} lamenting that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [spends]{.underline} "all this
[money on something that, [if]{.mark} it's [used,
it's]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[the end]{.mark} of the
world]{.underline}." The president's interest is fortuitous. Amid the
turbulence of his administration, on this particular matter,
[[Trump's]{.mark} inclination toward nuclear [restraint could]{.mark}
push him to [negotiate]{.mark} real
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}---at a time when the world badly
needs such measures to succeed.

[Nuclear [arms control is dying]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2010 [New
[START]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline} is the only remaining nuclear arms
control agreement between the United States and Russia. New START, for
which I led negotiations on the U.S. side, limits the number of nuclear
warheads, missiles, and launchers each country can deploy and includes
various mechanisms to verify implementation. But it [[is]{.mark} due to
go [out]{.mark} of force [in]{.mark} less than a year, in February
[2026]{.mark}. And its]{.underline} efficacy has [already been
weakened]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir [Putin declared
in]{.underline} February 2023, a year after his full-scale invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}, that [Moscow would cease]{.underline} to
implement [the treaty]{.underline} as long as the United States
continued to assist in Ukraine's defense---linking the fate of nuclear
arms control to an extraneous issue for the first time in the nearly 60
years of nuclear negotiations between Moscow and Washington. The Kremlin
has been unwilling to engage in any kind of nuclear discussion ever
since.

[Meanwhile, China has been]{.underline} steadily [modernizing its
nuclear forces]{.underline}. Where once Beijing maintained only a modest
force of a couple hundred warheads and delivery systems designed and
deployed to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack, it now has more
than 500 warheads and is increasing the production of delivery systems.
China is building up all three legs of the nuclear
triad---intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched
ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers---which enables a country to
launch nuclear weapons from land, sea, and air. The U.S. Department of
Defense has estimated that by 2035 China will have acquired as many as
1,500 nuclear warheads. All the while, Beijing has declined to discuss
its rapid buildup with Washington.

Thus, in the near future, the United States could face two nuclear
powers, [Russia and China]{.underline}, deploying similar numbers of
nuclear warheads. [These two]{.underline} close partners [could together
threaten a first strike against which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would not have enough]{.underline} weapons [to
respond]{.underline}. Their combined superiority [would undermine the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' ability to deter them,
[with]{.underline} potential [catastrophic consequences for]{.underline}
regional and [global stability]{.underline}. The threat is grave, but it
is not unmanageable. There is a better chance for Washington to reach
some accommodation with Moscow and Beijing on nuclear matters than on
any of the other various military, political, and economic conflicts
between these powers. If the United States under Trump can successfully
reengage with Russia to sustain nuclear parity and engage for the first
time with China to control nuclear risks, the three countries can avoid
a Cold War--style nuclear arms race that would be costly, dangerous, and
ultimately pointless for them all.

ATOMIC FIXATION

Trump has been thinking about the problem of nuclear weapons for a long
time. As far back as the mid-1980s, when Trump was a young real estate
tycoon, he lobbied President Ronald Reagan (unsuccessfully) to appoint
him as the United States' lead negotiator in strategic arms talks with
the Soviet Union. Although Trump is known to frequently change his mind,
he has been notably consistent in his focus on nuclear threats and the
need to control them. In the president's view, these weapons are a bad
investment: why waste money on something that can never be used because
using them would likely mean the end of the world?

Trump was frustrated by his inability to make headway on nuclear issues
during his first term. His efforts to negotiate with the North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un to undo Pyongyang's deployment of nuclear weapons and
to advance an arms reduction deal with China and Russia both came to
naught. Now, Trump appears determined to try again, in February
describing talks on the matter with Putin and Chinese President Xi
Jinping as "one of the first meetings I want to have."

Full denuclearization, as Trump has gestured at, is too much to expect.
But there is significant opportunity for Washington to make
progress---in different ways---with Russia and China. In Russia, the
United States is dealing with a nuclear peer. For six decades the two
countries' nuclear relationship has been based on parity: an equivalence
of numbers and freedom to mix on force structure, meaning that as long
as they keep the total number of nuclear warheads below equal limits,
they can deploy them on different delivery systems. The United States
has preferred more sea-launched missiles, whereas Russia has opted for
more intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are launched from the
ground. Over this period, Washington and Moscow have been engaging in
serious efforts to limit and reduce their arsenals of nuclear weapons,
sometimes through treaties and sometimes through unilateral initiatives
conducted in parallel. This nuclear arms limitation is now eroding.
Trump's goal should be to restore it.

The United States should have a different objective with regard to
China: to convince Beijing that its interests lie in predictability and
stability. Unlike Russia's weapons, China's nuclear forces are still far
inferior to those of the United States. Although its forces are
modernizing quickly, China will not become a nuclear peer for a decade
or more. In the meantime, Washington should engage with Beijing to
understand its objectives, create predictability about future force
structure and modernization plans, and lower the risk of
misunderstandings that could lead to a nuclear crisis. Rather than
focusing on the size of China's arsenal, the United States should be
trying to build mutual understanding with China and exercise mutual
restraint in order to avoid a nuclear arms race---in other words, arms
control.

BACK TO THE TABLE

In the case of Russia, the path to nuclear negotiations is relatively
straightforward. U.S. and Russian negotiators have been at this business
for nearly 60 years and know each other well. Since the 1970s, when
Washington and Moscow were at each other's throats, the two parties have
managed to control, limit, and reduce nuclear weapons no matter what
else was happening in their relationship. Especially after the 1962
Cuban missile crisis, the nearest the two sides came to nuclear war,
both appreciated that nuclear weapons pose an existential threat to
humanity and committed to isolating the nuclear dialogue on its own
track. The United States and Russia continued implementing New START
amid the first Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Putin seized Crimea in
2014.

On the Russian side, this attitude changed with Russia's second invasion
of Ukraine, in 2022, after which Putin halted implementation of New
START. But the Kremlin may now be willing to reverse that decision and
launch negotiations on a new nuclear treaty in parallel with a process
to resolve the war in Ukraine. In February 2025, Putin commented, "We
and the United States have the question of prolonging New START.
Probably everyone else has forgotten, but I remember it is going out of
force in about a year, in February 2026." Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov has remarked on the change in Washington's tone since Trump took
office, noting it may signal a new opportunity for nuclear talks. Even
if Moscow and Washington cannot settle on a replacement treaty before
New START goes out of force next February, rapid nuclear expansion is
not inevitable. For a long period in the 1980s and 1990s, no nuclear
arms treaty was in force, and the United States and the Soviet Union
simply agreed to abide by arms limits negotiated in the 1970s in the
SALT II agreement, which was never ratified. Russia and the United
States could do something similar today. Both could agree publicly to
sustain the limits of New START until new limits can be negotiated.
China, France, and the United Kingdom---the other nuclear weapons states
under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty---should also pledge not to
undermine the provisions of New START by building up warhead numbers or
deploying destabilizing weapon systems.

THREE-BODY PROBLEM

China is a more complicated case. The country is modernizing its nuclear
arsenal apace, and both Washington and U.S. allies are growing concerned
that China seeks to become a peer competitor of the United States in
nuclear as well as conventional forces. If China, as the U.S. Department
of Defense estimates, can build around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035
and proceeds to deploy all of them, it would more or less reach the
1,550-warhead limit the United States and Russia each agreed to under
New START. In the worst-case scenario---in which China and Russia
together threaten the United States with nuclear attack---Washington
would face such nuclear superiority that it could be deterred from
defending its interests.

The United States can and should plan for such a scenario, to protect
both itself and the allies that depend on Washington's nuclear umbrella.
But it is also important to be clear-headed about the extent of the
threat. Although the United States and Russia each deploy 1,550 warheads
under New START, both keep many in reserve. The United States has a
total of approximately 5,277 warheads and Russia approximately 5,449. If
forced to confront a combined nuclear threat, the United States could
deploy more warheads, drawing on the several thousand that it holds in
reserve. It could place more warheads on its missiles at sea or on land
and designate others to be delivered by its bomber force.

If the United States were forced to deploy more warheads on missiles, it
would exceed the limits laid out in New START, Russia might do the same,
and a form of arms race could begin. It is therefore important that
China pledge not to undermine those limits and prompt a U.S. response.
This is where negotiations come in. Washington does not have the long
history of negotiating with the Chinese on nuclear matters that it has
with the Russians, but it is not totally bereft of experience. The
United States and China engage with each other through major
multilateral regimes such as the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
and the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and China is currently
chairing the five-country forum made up of the nuclear weapons states
designated in the NPT (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and
the United States). Beijing knows the issues and stakes in nuclear
negotiations and what is required to maintain strategic nuclear
stability.

Yet China has stubbornly resisted further negotiations, arguing that,
because of the wide gap between Chinese and U.S. nuclear forces, the
transparency required for nuclear diplomacy would make China too
vulnerable. Only when Washington and Moscow both shrink their nuclear
arsenals, China's diplomats often say, will it be time to talk. That
position has not changed as China modernizes its nuclear forces; builds
new ballistic missiles, submarines, and bombers; and acquires additional
warheads. The Chinese government has even tried to deny the extent of
its buildup, insisting for years that 300 new missile silos constructed
north and west of Beijing were wind farms.

Both Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden after him were
frustrated by China's refusal to talk about its nuclear modernization.
The first Trump administration attempted to shoe-horn Beijing into the
New START Treaty, effectively trying to subject China to the same
nuclear reduction agreement as two vastly superior nuclear powers,
Russia and the United States. Chinese leaders, unsurprisingly, reacted
badly and shut down further discussions. They remained unreceptive
during the Biden administration. During a 2023 summit in California,
Biden thought he had made a breakthrough with Xi about starting nuclear
talks, but Beijing again refused to come to the table.

[[This time may be different]{.mark}. With New START going out of force,
[negotiations can begin]{.mark} with a [clean]{.mark}
slate]{.underline}. There will be no legally binding treaty for China to
be forced into---although China can and should be ready to support the
limits outlined in New START if Russia and the United States agree to do
so. Yet many stumbling blocks could derail progress. Plenty of China
hawks in Washington and America hawks in Beijing could try to prevent
the two sides from talking to each other. The escalating U.S.-Chinese
trade war does not help. And although Trump evidently is keen to talk
with Xi, it is unclear whether he places as high a priority on nuclear
negotiations with China as he seems to place on nuclear negotiations
with Russia.

THE ART OF THE DEAL

The best way for Washington to proceed is with two parallel
negotiations. The first would be with Russia, to extend the limits of
New START beyond February 2026 and then to seek additional limits on all
nuclear warheads, deployed and nondeployed, strategic and nonstrategic.
Trump took a significant step in this direction in his first term, when
he got Putin to agree in principle to a freeze on all existing nuclear
warhead stocks. He could build on that framework now by seeking
restrictions on Russia's newest delivery systems, such as the Poseidon
nuclear-propelled and -armed torpedo.

Russia, concerned by Trump's talk of building a new U.S. missile defense
system, dubbed [[the]{.mark} "[Golden Dome]{.mark}," [could insist
on]{.mark} putting that system on the [negotiating]{.mark}
agenda]{.underline}. From Moscow's perspective, strengthened U.S.
missile defenses could undermine the Russian nuclear deterrent: the
United States, expecting its defenses to hold against nuclear
retaliation, might no longer consider a first nuclear strike on Russia
to carry an unacceptably high risk. Putin has been particularly
concerned about this possibility and was initially critical of New START
because it did not limit U.S. missile defenses. If Moscow demands that
missile defenses be on the agenda, then Washington should insist that
limits on Russia's own advanced missile defense systems, such as the
S-500, also be discussed.

The second negotiation with China, focusing on nuclear arms control,
should start with a Chinese pledge not to build or deploy enough
warheads to undermine the limits of New START. Beijing will need to be
more open about its nuclear modernization and be ready to take steps
that reduce the risk that misunderstandings about U.S. and Chinese
nuclear postures lead to instability or escalation. Data exchanges,
notification of activities such as missile testing, joint definitions of
terms related to nuclear weapons, and better crisis communications could
all be part of the package.

Although negotiations with China should be mainly about controls rather
than limits, there is one nuclear system [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates should [[push
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as Russia, [[to ban]{.mark}: the
fractional orbital bombardment system, or [FOBS]{.mark}. FOBS
missiles]{.underline}, which do not follow a predictable ballistic
trajectory, [could strike without warning and]{.underline} are capable
of maneuvering to [evade defenses]{.underline}, represent a grave
concern for critical command and control sites. According to U.S. Air
and Space Force officials, [China tested a FOBS]{.underline} in the open
ocean in 2021, [sparking]{.underline} particular [alarm]{.underline} in
Washington and underscoring the need to include prohibition in any
future talks.

Trump should not waste the opportunity he has now. [[Even if]{.mark}
the]{.underline} hurdle of [Senate [ratification proves too
high]{.mark}]{.underline} for the United States to enter a legally
binding nuclear arms treaty---[[and]{.mark} it [may not, given]{.mark}
the strong [influence Trump exercises]{.mark} over
Congress---well-crafted]{.underline} political [[agreements]{.mark} with
China and Russia [could still be effective]{.mark}]{.underline}. Apart
from these essential talks with Beijing and Moscow, Trump should also
address the effect his [lukewarm support for U.S. allies]{.underline} in
Europe and Asia is having on proliferation debates in those regions. The
president speaks adamantly against increasing numbers of [nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, but his actions [are driving Germany, Poland,
So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea, and other countries [to openly
consider building their own arsenals]{.underline}. If he is truly
interested in keeping nuclear weapons in check, Trump and his
administration should be reinforcing the U.S. commitment to extended
nuclear deterrence. By reducing the temptation for allies to build their
own nuclear weapons and stopping a new arms race with China and Russia
in its tracks, Trump can do the world a favor and bring the rising
nuclear threat under control.

The [recent test]{.underline} would thus calm
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was worried that the US BMD would
block China's few surviving weapons in case of a US first strike. The
test [included an HGV with a "[f]{.mark}]{.underline}ractional
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rbital [[b]{.underline}]{.mark}ombardment"
[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}ystem, [which can hit a target]{.underline} by
entering [in lower orbit]{.underline} --- it [can reach the
US]{.underline} via the South Pole, where America has few early warning
systems. Moreover, [HGVs fly at lower altitudes]{.underline} than
ballistic missiles, which means [they could]{.underline} potentially
[escape early warning]{.underline} systems, [aided by the earth's
curvature]{.underline}. Experts thus consider hypersonic weapons [highly
destabilizing]{.underline}, not due to their speed but [because of their
stealth and]{.underline} exceptional [maneuverability.]{.underline}

Despite the absence of a strategic surprise, [China's test
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[have a Sputnik]{.mark}-like
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Sputnik shock drove the Eisenhower
administration to seek space arms, [[triggering a]{.mark} ballistic
[missile race]{.mark}]{.underline} that saw two superpowers come close
to a disastrous faceoff during the Cuban missile crisis. The Chinese
tests have the potential to set off an aggressive competition among the
nuclear powers to modernize their nuclear arsenals and add new,
potentially destabilizing capabilities to their arsenal.

Emerging technologies like hypersonic weapons systems impact strategic
stability in two ways: They undermine "crisis stability", thereby
[[incentivizing]{.mark} the [nuclear]{.mark} first-[use and]{.mark} they
[erode]{.mark} "arms race [stability]{.mark}" by [encouraging]{.mark} an
[action-reaction cycle. In the]{.mark} present [era of minimal]{.mark}
arms [control]{.mark}]{.underline} measures, the Chinese hypersonic
missile system test [[will trigger]{.mark} an intense [arms
race]{.mark}]{.underline} both at the global and regional levels. The US
is already developing conventional long-range hypersonic missiles. With
the Chinese test, the US may be forced to expand its hypersonic program
and further modernize its missile defense systems.

China's nuclear-tipped hypersonic weapon systems, though not
particularly India-focused, [could [nudge New Delhi
to]{.mark}]{.underline} adopt two courses of action. First, [[accelerate
its]{.mark} hypersonic missiles [program]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second,
consider erecting an equally robust missile defense. India is reportedly
developing a dual-capable hypersonic cruise missile and an anti-ship
hypersonic missile. Chinese advancement in stealth technologies will
drive New Delhi to seek similar capabilities but also develop effective
countermeasures. [This can then set off a regional arms
race]{.underline}, a sign that is [[not]{.underline}]{.mark}
particularly [[encouraging for]{.mark} regional
[peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[China's]{.underline} hypersonic missile test [may]{.underline} not have
[come with a Sputnik-like surprise]{.underline}, but it has the
potential to set off a post-Sputnik-like arms race [that does not augur
well for the strategic stability]{.underline} both at the global and
regional level.

Weinberger under President Reagan (\*Henry F. Cooper, \*\*Daniel J.
Gallington, April 2, 2025, "Trump's 'Golden Dome' for a far more
dangerous world? For sure," Washington Times,
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/apr/2/trumps-golden-dome-far-dangerous-world-sure/)

Here, we expand on our Feb. 2 view that "Trump's Iron Dome strategy
echoes Reagan's SDI missile defense vision." [We applaud]{.underline}
President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} reference to it as a
[[beautiful "Golden Dome"]{.mark} that [can protect the]{.mark} entire
[free world from]{.mark} missile, hypersonic and drone [attacks]{.mark}
emanating from known and unknown missile threats worldwide.]{.underline}

It's a particularly appropriate update after the 42nd anniversary of
President Reagan's March 23, 1983, speech and subsequent actions that
led to his Strategic Defense Initiative.

At the height of the Cold War, SDI brought the Soviets back to the table
after they walked out of all negotiations, alleging "Star Wars" was the
cause. In fact, they were seeking to influence national elections in the
U.S. and among most of our closest allies. After regular consultation
with our allies, all these national leaders were reelected.

After SDI prompted a major interest in space, the Nuclear and Space
Talks began in March 1985. We were at the Geneva negotiating table
defending SDI in the Defense and Space Talks component, which provided
negotiating leverage for the associated Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty talks.

Those negotiations led to the first-ever major reductions in nuclear
weapons without any limits beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
placed on SDI (renamed Ballistic Missile Defense) programs to develop
missile defenses for the United States and our friends and allies. This
constraint, as a matter of international law, on the development,
testing and deployment of ballistic missile defense systems continued
until June 2002, when President George W. Bush withdrew from its terms.
Nevertheless, many among the so-called arms control elite still seek to
constrain our ability to employ/deploy our most capable technologies to
protect all Americans and our friends and allies by the most effective
means by far: with space-based defenses.

As we defended SDI in our negotiations with the Soviet Union, we
collaborated with all our allies. SDI's global reach attracted them so
much that many participated in its research and development. In many
ways, this was NATO's finest hour. Japan provided well over \$1 billion
to help develop and deploy its first ballistic missile defense systems.

We can still realize Reagan's SDI vision. Exciting new technologies give
life to the basic ideas and concepts to defend against all kinds of
missiles, particularly from space.

As former Cold Warriors, we see the world as far more dangerous now than
when the Soviet Union was at its peak threat. We have several reasons
for our view, including a better ability to define the threat and
construct/maintain our forces to deter it.

We did this for many years [[during]{.mark} the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}, echoing the wisdom of Gen. Russell Dougherty,
former Strategic Air Command Commander, who said deterrence required two
essential elements: capability and will. We had both, without any doubt,
and assured that condition by maintaining a capability to retaliate in
kind to any Soviet nuclear attack.

[We maintained a survivable retaliatory capability]{.underline} of
nuclear-armed intercontinental-range ballistic missiles,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a major fleet of nuclear-armed
strategic bombers, [but [we limited]{.mark} our [efforts to
defend]{.mark} against [ballistic missile]{.mark}]{.underline}
attack[s]{.underline}, sometimes described as assuring our [[survival
against]{.mark} an "[accidental launch]{.mark}."]{.underline} Initially,
the ABM Treaty limited us to two ground-based sites and eventually
morphed into today's single site in Alaska.

This condition was shorthanded as mutually assured destruction, a
less-pertinent condition [today]{.underline} as we confront two "peer"
nuclear threats, [[Russia]{.mark} and [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
lesser threatening powers with nuclear weapons, such as
[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [[Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The idea of mutually assured destruction never satisfied Reagan, and he
called for new conditions. To quote from his speech that launched SDI:

"I am directing a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a
long-term research and development program to begin to achieve our
ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic nuclear
missiles. This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate
the weapons themselves. We seek neither military superiority nor
political advantage. Our only purpose, one all people share, is to
search for ways to reduce the danger of nuclear war. My fellow
Americans, tonight we are launching an effort which holds the promise of
changing the course of human history. There will be risks, and results
take time. But I believe we can do it."

We were privileged to participate in negotiations with the Soviet Union
and defend SDI against its threats. Those negotiations led to major
reductions in nuclear weapons, as was Reagan's objective.

[[Today, we need]{.underline}]{.mark} much more than simple deterrence.
We need [a]{.underline} ubiquitous/[universal
missile]{.underline}/hyper/drone [system of [defensive
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} and technologies that depend [[on
new]{.mark} and ever-[evolving tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies. [[This
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} space-based sensors and
[anti-missile]{.underline} (especially launch phase) [interceptors,
and]{.underline} eventually enhanced ground-, air- and space-based
[[directed energy defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If the Cold War defined the first nuclear age, today we are living in a
new nuclear age in which a range of both old and new threats co-exist.
[A [nuclear]{.mark} exchange]{.underline} between the USA and the USSR
[escalating into mutual [annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline} was the
dominant threat during the first nuclear age. This receded during the
second nuclear age but [has made a comeback]{.underline}. Global
terrorism and proliferation were the primary risks during the second
nuclear age. These have not diminished. In addition, however, new
technological developments are blurring the dividing line between
conventional and nuclear weapons and nuclear frontiers have expanded to
outer space and cyberspace.

Nuclear risks [today [can be]{.mark} divided into]{.underline} four
categories:

[1. [Geopolitical rivalries]{.mark} have [returned, raising]{.mark} the
[risk of]{.mark}]{.underline} premeditated [nuclear
[exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[2. [Lack of comm]{.mark}]{.underline}unication[[s
between]{.underline}]{.mark} different nuclear [rival [states]{.mark}
has raised the risks of escalation]{.underline}. In the absence of clear
red lines, [[the]{.mark} fire [break between conventional and
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [is]{.mark} being [eroded]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[3. The risk of miscalc]{.underline}ulation existed even during the
first nuclear age and has been well documented.3Today, [[with compressed
timelines]{.mark} and]{.underline} dependence on
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}-based [[and cyber assets]{.mark}, which can
be tampered with, the [risks of]{.mark} a system [malfunction, rogue
launch and miscalc]{.mark}]{.underline}ulation [[are]{.mark} much
[higher]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[4. The [risk of a]{.mark}]{.underline} global [[terrorist]{.mark} group
acquiring a nuclear device]{.underline} has been partially addressed
with improvements in nuclear security practices but it [[has not
disappeared]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The USA came out with a National Security Strategy in December 2017,
followed by a National Defense Strategy and in February 2018, the
Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). These documents highlight a return to
inter-state strategic competition, identify Russia and China as
revisionist rivals and also broaden the role of nuclear weapons in US
national security strategy. Had the 2018 NPR been released earlier, it
is possible that the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin might
even have been compelled to move the Doomsday Clock closer than two
minutes to midnight. The new NPR adds to concerns because it reverses a
number of key principles from the previous NPRs commissioned by
Presidents Bill Clinton (1994), George W. Bush (2002) and Barack Obama
(2010).

The most significant is a reversal of the assessment that since the end
of the Cold War, the USA no longer faced the threat of extinction from
Soviet nuclear weapons and was therefore able to reduce the role of
nuclear weapons in its security calculus. The 2018 NPR declares that
[global threat conditions have worsened]{.underline}, "including
increasingly explicit threats [from potential
adversaries]{.underline}."4 Another development has been President
Donald Trump's decision that the USA be ready to conduct a nuclear test
at short notice, within six months of a decision.5 Consequently, a
30-year modernization plan has been announced with a price tag of
\$1.2trillion that could rise to as much as \$1.7 trillion.

The USA is not the only one thinking of modernization though details of
pro-grams of other states that have nuclear weapons are less explicit.
After the 1999 Kosovo war, [[Russia began]{.mark} to
reconsider]{.underline} its approach to nuclear weapons because of
[tech]{.underline}nological [asymmetry]{.underline} vis-à-vis US
conventional capabilities. [This led to]{.underline} the evolution of
["[escalate to de-escalate]{.mark}" doctrine]{.underline},6 indicating
an increased reliance on nuclear weapons (escalation) with a view to
bringing about a resolution of the dispute (de-escalation) on terms
favorable to Russia. Subsequently, Russia began to modernise its nuclear
arsenal while also undertaking improvements in its conventional
capabilities. In a speech to the Russian parliament on 1 March 2018
President Vladimir Putin talked of five new weapons systems that can
evade US interception capabilities.7

[[China too]{.mark} is undertaking a nuclear modernization]{.underline}
but geared more to ensuring mobility and survivability for its
land-based forces, stealth capability for its bomber air-craft, quieter
submarines and replacing liquid fueled missiles by solid fueled engines.
China claims that its modernization is intended to ensure its
second-strike capabilities.

[[India is]{.underline}]{.mark} making steady progress towards
[[operationalizing its triad]{.underline}]{.mark} of land, sea and
air-based platforms. In graduating to "full spectrum deterrence" with
the intro-duction of tactical nuclear weapons, [[Pakistan has]{.mark}
the fastest [growing]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline} weapons
[[program]{.mark}. Another source of growing risk is the]{.underline}
increasingly [shrill rhetoric]{.underline} between the leaders of the
USA and the Democratic People's Republic [of]{.underline} Korea
([[DPRK]{.underline}]{.mark} or North Korea). Trump has also put the
[nuclear]{.underline} deal with [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}--the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action--on notice, unless it is tightened to cover
other activity such as [[missile testing]{.mark} and regional
behavior.]{.underline}

Most likely, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
maintain its superpower status in the coming decades]{.underline}. While
the United States will in all likelihood continue as a superpower,
[history may repeat itself]{.underline}. Similar to the way the Soviet
Union was once considered a superpower, [[China may]{.mark} also [emerge
as a superpower]{.mark}]{.underline}. China may be reluctant to take on
the same adversarial role the Soviet Union adopted, however, since
becoming a hostile U.S. adversary would presumably lead to additional
U.S. sanctions and hinder China\'s economic growth. Russia is unlikely
to reemerge as a superpower as its economy is significantly behind those
of the United States and China, and it suffers from systemic corruption.
Given Russia's legacy nuclear weapons and its ability to use espionage
to gain military parity in specific weapons, however, it is likely to
remain in its current position as a player on the international stage.

If this analysis is correct, [[Cold War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}---discussed in chapter 1 as an ongoing state of
political and military tension between opposing geopolitical power
blocs---will become a "Conventional" Cold War. We can characterize the
Conventional Cold War [as a time when superpowers continually [seek new
and]{.mark} more [potent]{.mark} conventional
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Conventional Cold War leaves us with two critical questions:

1\. [What will deter [Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[election
meddling]{.mark} and [aggression to occupy]{.mark} its
[neighbors]{.mark}, similar to]{.underline} its occupation of territory
in Georgia and [Ukraine?]{.underline}

2\. [What will deter [China's]{.mark}]{.underline} further
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntellectual [[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roperty
[[thefts, cyberattacks, and]{.underline}]{.mark} sovereignty-driven
[actions [in the China Sea]{.mark}?]{.underline}

From my perspective, the answers should not involve open conflict with
conventional weapons. The might of conventional weapons is approaching
the devastating power of nuclear weapons, so they are likely to have the
same dire consequences for humanity. For example, [high-intensity [laser
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} on an adversary [may [result in]{.mark} a
"[laser winter]{.mark}" [similar to]{.mark} a [nuclear
winter]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [[a by-product of]{.mark} the
[smoke]{.mark} rising from the fires following a nuclear attack.
The]{.underline} destructive [[power]{.mark} of]{.underline}
high-intensity [lasers may [result in]{.mark} the [same type of
fires]{.mark}, thus [giving rise to]{.mark} a [winter]{.mark} that would
be [just as dangerous]{.mark} a threat to humanity [as]{.mark} a

Yet [[the s]{.mark}tatus [quo is destabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline} in
its own way. [[Satellites can]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[be destroyed by missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} fired from Earth,
disabled by [[lasers]{.underline}]{.mark}, electronically [[jammed
and]{.mark} knocked offline by [cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Countries]{.mark} now [also]{.mark}]{.underline} regularly
[conduct]{.underline} so-called rendezvous and proximity
[operations]{.underline} --- maneuvering satellites [to [inspect
and]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[repair]{.underline}]{.mark} others.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} purported maintenance satellites
[[could]{.mark} just as [easily be]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed [[to
eavesdrop]{.mark} on]{.underline}, blind, [[capture or destroy]{.mark} a
[rival's]{.mark} space [assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2019, Russia
released a "nesting doll" satellite hidden inside a larger one. China
last year conducted an exercise involving five satellites swooping
around one another in what US officials called "dogfighting" practice.

[Right now, [there are no]{.mark}]{.underline} international [rules or
[norms]{.mark}]{.underline} in place [about]{.underline} when and how
closely countries can approach other nations' [satellites]{.underline},
which of them should be off-limits, what the consequences of a
cyberattack or temporary jamming might be, which ostensibly innocent
actions might be perceived as hostile, and so on. [The [risks
of]{.mark}]{.underline} misunderstandings,
[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}ulations [[and]{.mark} --- given the
incentive to attack first in a conflict --- inadvertent [escalation
are]{.mark} dangerously [high]{.mark} and rising.]{.underline}

The [US should press [Russia and China]{.mark} to [agree to]{.mark} a
[code of conduct]{.mark}]{.underline} for such orbital activities,
similar to the incidents-at-sea agreements negotiated during the Cold
War to prevent close encounters from spiraling into conflict. Such a
deal [could [introduce hotlines]{.mark}]{.underline} between space
commanders to clear up misunderstandings and lower tensions; a ban on
close approaches to satellites vital to [[nuclear command and
control]{.underline}]{.mark}; a system of pre-launch and pre-maneuver
notifications; [discussions about]{.underline} space
[doctrines]{.underline}, what actions would be considered hostile and
what responses would be likely; [and protocols governing
proximity]{.underline} operations.

Russia and China should also join the US in forswearing any further
antisatellite weapons tests that create debris. All these measures would
improve transparency, strengthen deterrence and reduce the risk of
unintended confrontation.

They could also provide building blocks to the more binding treaty
Russia and China claim they want to see. Both nations likely know that
Golden Dome won't ever defeat their large and sophisticated arsenals,
given the cost and sheer number of space-based interceptors that would
be required. While the US may still want to pursue elements of the
program, it should not be afraid to discuss its future as part of
broader arms-control talks.

In the meantime, [[Golden Dome presents a]{.mark} good
[opportunity]{.mark} for]{.underline} the world's preeminent space
[powers to build trust and avoid a conflict]{.underline}. They'd be
foolish to waste it.

[In addition to ballistic missile strikes against the homeland,
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} or Russia [might [employ cruise missiles to
coerce]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates at or below the
nuclear threshold]{.underline}. The 2022 National Defense Strategy fact
sheet states: "Recognizing growing kinetic and non-kinetic threats to
the United States' homeland from our strategic competitors, the
Department will take necessary actions to increase resilience---our
ability to withstand, fight through, and recover quickly from
disruption."22 [Among these]{.underline} "growing kinetic [threats" are
China's]{.underline} and Russia's [pursuit of advanced
[long-range]{.mark} cruise [missiles for targeting]{.mark} critical
[infrastructure]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [uses to
project power]{.mark} in support of its national interests]{.underline}
and allies.23 [The US government has long-recognized that [adversaries
will]{.mark} seek to [defeat]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}]{.underline} theory
of victory [[by threatening]{.mark} the [means of]{.mark} projecting
[power]{.mark} overseas in an attempt [to diminish political will and
delay]{.mark} the [use of]{.mark} overwhelming [force against]{.mark}
their [regional aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}.24

For example, [[US officials]{.mark} have [warned]{.mark} about
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} and Russia [[planning]{.mark} to conduct
offensive [strikes against]{.mark} the US [homeland below]{.mark} the
[threshold of nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use. These attacks]{.mark} may be
limited in number and [focus on]{.mark} the kind of [targets
that]{.mark} would [avoid]{.mark} provoking too [costly]{.mark} a [US
response--- yet be significant enough]{.mark} in effect [to]{.mark}
potentially [cause US officials to reconsider]{.mark} their [support of
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 Gen. VanHerck, following the 2022
National Defense Strategy, stated recently that Russia's long-range
conventional cruise missiles are a growing concern and required an
improved US ability to detect and track those threats. In support of
this, the fiscal year (FY) 2024 budget requests \$516 million to procure
over-the-horizon radars.26 These new systems would provide situational
awareness across domains to identify air and cruise missile threats
inbound to the United States. In parallel, as Peppi DeBiaso notes, "DOD
has designated the U.S. Air Force as the Executive Agent for [homeland
\[[cruise missile defense]{.mark}\]]{.underline} to examine, in
conjunction with other agencies (e.g., \[the US Missile Defense Agency\]
and the Services), architectures, including sensors, interceptors and
command and control (C2) arrangements for CMD of critical military
targets within the United States. This analysis is in the early stages
and specific architectural options have yet to be defined," and this
analysis is unlikely to be completed before early 2024.27 These
developments, if pursued to completion, [can help [strengthen deterrence
by discouraging]{.mark} adversary [perceptions]{.mark} that a vulnerable
[US homeland]{.mark} offers an [opportunity for coercion]{.mark} on the
cheap, [where]{.mark} even [small-scale attacks offer]{.mark} a low risk
of failure with [the greatest]{.mark} potential [reward: US
capitulation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### There is a high incentive for either conventional or nuclear coercion\-\--Chinese doctrine shows this is part of their strategy.

Michael Chase, in his [[analysis of the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2004
edition of the [[S]{.mark}cience of [S]{.mark}econd [A]{.mark}rtillery
[C]{.mark}ampaigns, which China watchers [considered fundamental to
understanding China's rocket]{.mark} forces
[doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the 2010s,
[[identifies]{.mark} several]{.underline} potential [[target types
for]{.mark} China's [conventional]{.mark} missile [strikes:
strategic]{.mark}- and campaign-level [command]{.mark}]{.underline},
control, and communications centers; [[radar]{.mark} installations;
information-related hubs; [missile and air]{.mark} force [bases;
naval]{.mark} facilities; logistics [hubs]{.mark}; chokepoints
in]{.underline} lines of [communications; [energy
infrastructure]{.mark}; and aircraft carrier strike groups]{.underline}.
He notes that the Science of Second Artillery Campaigns describes the
missile strike campaign's intent as "paralyzing the enemy's command
system; weakening the enemy's military strength and its ability to
continue operations; creating psychological shock in the enemy and
shaking its operational resolve; and checking the powerful enemy's
military intervention activities."102

Chase turns to the discussion in China's National Defense University's
2001 edition of the Campaign Theory Study Guide of China's nuclear
counterstrike campaign to better understand how the Chinese military
approaches targeting assets in an adversary's homeland. The campaign's
mission and potential targets are similar to that of a conventional
missile strike campaign, but with more emphasis on destroying
strategic-level targets to paralyze enemy command and control and to
reduce war-supporting potential.103

Second, many experts within China seem to expect a particular level of
U.S. conventional strikes against the Chinese homeland in the event of a
U.S.-Chinese conflict in the western Pacific that they believe will not
elicit a Chinese nuclear response. In their 2015 examination of China's
nuclear posture and strategy, Cunningham and Fravel found that their
Chinese interlocutors did not believe that U.S. conventional strikes
against China's counter-intervention, or anti-access and area-denial
forces, would lead to China using nuclear weapons.104 This may point to
a more general belief that not all counter-homeland conventional strikes
will warrant a nuclear response from China.

What could lead to nuclear escalation, though, might be U.S.
conventional operations that degrade or destroy portions of China's
nuclear forces, including its nuclear command and control. While China's
declaratory nuclear policy is that it would not be first in a conflict
to use nuclear weapons, the Chinese government has not announced how it
would act following U.S. conventional strikes against China's nuclear
forces.105

Third, [in]{.underline} their more [[recent review of Chinese literature
and interviews]{.underline}]{.mark} with members of what they call
"China's strategic community," Cunningham and Fravel [[found]{.mark}
that Chinese [experts are confident]{.mark} that [conventional
escalation]{.mark} can [be controlled]{.mark} and conventional
warfighting intensity can be limited]{.underline} (with "limits on
intensity" left unspecified) [as long as the nuclear threshold had not
yet been crossed in a U.S.-Chinese conflict]{.underline}.106 Cunningham
and Fravel assess that [[Chinese experts]{.mark} generally
[discount]{.mark} an [opponent's disproportionate response to]{.mark}
Chinese [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}, reinforcing the Chinese strategic
community's perception of a robust conventional-nuclear firebreak.107 In
addition, because Chinese experts believe that nuclear offensive
operations cannot be controlled once initiated, they anticipate that the
United States would try to resolve a crisis with China involving
overseas U.S. defense commitments before the adversaries approached the
nuclear Rubicon.108

[[These]{.mark} beliefs [leave open]{.mark}, rather than foreclose, the
possibility of [China conducting]{.mark} counter-[homeland]{.mark}
conventional [strikes against]{.mark} what it considers [U.S. military
operations]{.mark} and strategic centers of gravity [to undermine U.S.
resolve]{.mark}, because [it sees]{.mark} the [nuclear
shadow]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., China's assured nuclear retaliatory
forces) [as [dampening]{.mark} U.S. nuclear [escalation
incentives]{.mark}]{.underline}. In essence, [China might believe that
its nuclear second-strike capabilities could make it safe to conduct
counter-homeland conventional strikes against the United
States]{.underline} in a future conflict.

### AT: BMD Fails\-\--T/L\-\--2AC

#### BMD works\-\--recent modernization has resolved concerns.

**DeBiaso 22**, Senior Associate, CSIS, former Director of the DoD
Office of Missile Defense Policy (Peppi DeBiaso, October 27, 2022,
"Homeland Missile Defense: Staying the Course," CSIS,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/homeland-missile-defense-staying-course-0)

More importantly, [[DOD]{.mark} is proceeding with]{.underline} the
[[modernization of]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark} system to [ensure it]{.mark}
can [effectively counter]{.mark}]{.underline} larger and [more
advanced]{.underline} rogue state [[ICBM threats]{.mark}. This
[includes]{.mark}]{.underline} funding the development of a new
interceptor, known as [the Next Generation Interceptor
([NGI]{.mark})]{.underline}, that is expected to add 20 additional
interceptors beginning in 2028. [Each of these]{.underline} newer
interceptors [will be [deployed with]{.mark} "[multiple kill
vehicle]{.mark} payload[s]{.mark} to reduce the number of interceptors
required]{.underline} to defeat a single ballistic missile threat to our
Nation." The NGI program with the multiple kill vehicle (MKV) represents
a significant technological development in the direction of reducing the
overall cost per interceptor while increasing the effectiveness of the
homeland defense posture against potentially larger missile threats. DOD
is also leveraging a competitive acquisition strategy to ensure
reliability and apply lessons learned from previous programs.
Additionally, as the existing 44 GBIs move toward the end of their
service life in the 2030s, NGIs would be available to supplement and
eventually replace them, providing for a fully modernized missile
defense system. 

[The budget [also funds improvement to]{.mark} the network of [space-
and land]{.mark}-based [sensors]{.mark} crucial to the [tracking]{.mark}
and targeting of [incoming missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}. DOD recently
completed the construction of a new Long Range Discrimination Radar
(LRDR) in Alaska and is developing the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking
Space Sensor (HBTSS). Together, these systems [[provide]{.mark} enhanced
tracking and [discrimination of]{.mark} advanced [ballistic and
hypersonic]{.mark} missile [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, which in turn
contributes to more efficient use of missile defense interceptors.

Collectively, [[these efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} to build a
second-generation homeland defense system [[lay a foundation to
address]{.mark} more [capable missile threats]{.mark}]{.underline} from
countries such as North Korea and Iran [in the years ahead]{.underline}.
However, if the United States is to avoid the risk of allowing its
missile defenses to lapse into technological obsolescence over time, [it
is essential]{.underline} not only for the administration and Congress
[to sustain current modernization]{.underline} efforts, but to define a
clear strategy for the next generation of missile defense concepts,
technologies, and capabilities. This means taking advantage of advanced
technologies to fight in new ways as is done in other domains of
military power. Just as the Pentagon is developing a sixth-generation
fighter-interceptor and an eighth-generation ICBM to adapt to evolving
military technology, threats, and opponents, the path to more capable
and effective missile defenses requires a commitment to pushing the
boundaries of new technologies and then moving with speed from
acquisition to deployment.

For missile defense, [[d]{.mark}irected [e]{.mark}nergy weapons in the
form of [lasers]{.mark}]{.underline} and high-powered microwave systems
[[hold]{.mark} considerable [promise as]{.mark} prospective [pathways
to]{.mark} next generation [missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}
providing for more effective interceptor capability at a potentially
lower cost. [Kinetic interceptors]{.underline} deployed [on]{.underline}
manned and unmanned [airborne platforms could [enable boost-phase
engagements]{.mark}]{.underline} and add layers to the U.S. active
defense posture. Additionally, [[progress in]{.mark} the U.S.
[commercial satellite sector]{.mark}]{.underline} over the last decade
[has [produced cheaper]{.mark} and more [capable
platforms]{.mark}]{.underline} for basing sensors [[to track]{.mark}
complex [missile threats, including]{.mark} those that may carry
countermeasures and [decoys]{.mark} intended to evade missile
defense.]{.underline}

#### "It doesn't work" is irrelevant\-\--missile defenses are political deterrents, and the prospect of an attack failing outweighs the technical aspects of attack probabilities. 

**DeBiaso 22**, Senior Associate, CSIS, former Director of the DoD
Office of Missile Defense Policy (Peppi DeBiaso, September 20, 2022,
"Why the US still must invest in homeland missile defense," Defense
News,

Second, [[defenses do not have to be large or perfect to inject]{.mark}
complexity and [doubt into]{.mark} the [adversary's]{.mark} pre-[war
planning]{.mark} and execution [of missile strikes. Even limited
defenses]{.mark} are capable of [weakening]{.mark} an opponent's
[confidence in]{.mark} its [ability to achieve]{.mark} its military
[objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Third, [[even in]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark} possible [advances in
rogue state]{.mark} long-range [missiles]{.mark}, missile [defenses
provide significant value to blunt]{.mark} blackmail or [coercion
where]{.mark} the [adversary]{.mark} seeks to [test]{.mark} American
[political will]{.mark} --- especially [by threatening limited
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}. In these circumstances, [defenses would
confront the aggressor with the prospect its attack would be
futile]{.underline}, while risking a devastating U.S. counterattack.

### AT: BMD Fails\-\--Countermeasures\-\--2AC/1AR

#### BMD [solves]{.underline} countermeasures AND [they fail]{.underline}. 

**Costlow 22**, Senior Analyst, National Institute for Public Policy,
Ph.D. Candidate, George Mason (Matthew Costlow, 2022, "Vulnerability is
No Virtue and Defense is No Vice: The Strategic Benefits of Expanded
U.S. Homeland Missile Defense," NIPP, Occasional Paper, Vol. 2, No. 9,
https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OP-Vol.-2-No.-9.pdf)

["[Countermeasures]{.mark},"]{.underline} also known as "penetration
aids," are devices designed to [[lower]{.mark} the [chance]{.mark} that
[an interceptor]{.mark} will]{.underline} successfully target and
[[destroy the warhead]{.underline}]{.mark}. These devices can enable a
number of tactics such as making all potentially threatening objects
look alike to the interceptor and radar [([such as]{.mark}
"[balloons]{.mark}"]{.underline} of equal size and shape)
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} actively interfering with the interceptor's
kill vehicle's sensors ([[jamming]{.mark} or dazzling]{.underline}). 90
Countermeasures can technically be deployed at any stage of a ballistic
missile's flight, but are most likely to be deployed either in the
boost-phase or the mid-course since re-entering the earth's atmosphere
in the terminal stage could cause the lighter countermeasures to have
observably different flight patterns than the heavier (and more likely
to be a warhead) objects, on which U.S. missile defenses could then
focus. The great advantage of space-based missile defense, therefore, is
that such a system could potentially intercept adversary missiles before
they deploy countermeasures and multiple warheads.

[The most [important]{.mark} factor [to note]{.mark}]{.underline} in
this regard is that [the [adversary]{.mark} would likely [need to
include]{.mark} different [counter]{.mark}measure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}
in its missile's payload [that are [optimized]{.mark}]{.underline} to
defeat missile defenses [[at each]{.mark} separate [stage of
flight]{.mark}. Including these]{.underline} different types of
[countermeasures is a cost [that may impact]{.mark} the total number of
warheads a missile can carry, the missile's [range (due to]{.mark} the
added [weight]{.mark}]{.underline} of countermeasures), [and the added
complexity]{.underline} of the overall system.91 In short, cheap and
lightweight countermeasures may allow for more warheads per missile, but
if the missile interceptors can distinguish the warheads from the
countermeasures, then the warheads are more vulnerable. On the other
hand, relatively expensive and heavy countermeasures that more
accurately resemble a warhead may be more effective in defeating a
missile interceptor, but take up scarce space in the missile payload,
reduce its effective range, and could potentially limit targeting
options.

What then might be the advantages of ["[layering]{.mark}" a U.S.
homeland [missile defense]{.mark} system]{.underline} in the presence of
adversary countermeasures? The advantages appear to be threefold. First,
having multiple systems that [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
[make multiple intercept attempts]{.underline} at each stage
[[increase]{.mark}s the overall [reliability]{.mark} of the
system]{.underline}. If, for example, one "layer" of missile defenses
experiences some technical problem, whether temporary or longer-lasting,
the other "layers" can potentially adapt their tactics to compensate.
Second, having multiple "layers" of missile defense increases the
resiliency of the overall system, in case one "layer" is degraded due to
adversary attacks or tactics. Third, having multiple "layers" of missile
defense increases the overall effectiveness of the system by providing
multiple intercept attempts at each stage of the target missile's
flight. For example, [if there are [three "layers" of]{.mark} U.S.
missile [defense]{.mark} (perhaps boost-phase, mid-course, and
terminal), [and each]{.mark} layer [has]{.mark} a [50 percent
chance]{.mark}]{.underline} of destroying the adversary missile per
attempt, [then [there is]{.mark} an [87]{.mark}.5[% chance]{.mark} the
system [will destroy]{.mark} the [warhead]{.mark}
successfully]{.underline}. If the system provides one more intercept
attempt with a 50 percent chance of success, the overall chance for a
successful kill increases to 94%. Finally, [[states that]{.mark} wish to
[test]{.mark} potentially advanced [counter]{.mark}measure[s]{.mark}
designed to defeat U.S. missile defenses may seek to test them in a
realistic environment, potentially providing [an opportunity for]{.mark}
U.S. [intelligence]{.mark} assets [to collect info]{.mark}rmation [that
could]{.mark} be used to [make]{.mark} U.S. missile
[interceptors]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}.]{.underline}92

Thus, [having multiple "layers" of missile defense vastly complicates
the difficulties for adversary attack planners, and]{.underline} more
broadly, [force planners]{.underline}, because countermeasures that may
perform well in one stage of flight may not perform well in other
stages. This point, in fact, was well recognized even during the early
days of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as stated by the strategist
Fred S. Hoffman:

> The existence of several different layers of defense would pose a
> complex problem to the offense in the design of countermeasures.
> Approaches that would be most effective against one layer would not in
> general be effective against others, and the existence of different
> types of sensors would pose conflicting requirements on decoys or
> jamming devices. The random attrition that attacking missiles would
> experience in early layers would make it much more difficult to
> concentrate forces on specific targets or to coordinate attacks
> designed to destroy or penetrate later layers. In this respect, a
> multilayer defense is similar to a counterforce attack in
> disorganizing structured attacks but superior in that the defense does
> not have to initiate the conflict.93

[[Given]{.mark} the [consequences of]{.mark} a [failed coercive
attack]{.mark} on the United States, the [adversary]{.mark} is likely to
[err on]{.mark} the [side of overestimating]{.mark} U.S.
[defense]{.mark} effectiveness, [which]{.mark} in turn, is likely to
[increase]{.mark} the overall [deterrent]{.mark} effect]{.underline}.
Again, quoting Fred Hoffman, "[Conservatism is likely to limit their
\[the adversary's\] reliance on clever, relatively cheap, but
questionably effective countermeasures]{.underline}."94

Then-Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (later, the
Missile Defense Agency), General Ronald Kadish testified in the year
2000, that:

> In other words, [[countermeasures]{.mark} may be [easy]{.mark} science
> [on paper, but]{.mark} effective ones are not all that simple to
> develop and even [less]{.mark} simple [to implement]{.mark}. The
> [engineering challenges are]{.mark} very [substantial]{.mark}.
> Structural issues can affect [range, accuracy]{.mark} and
> [payload]{.mark}, and [no nation can place confidence]{.mark} in the
> effectiveness of its program without testing]{.underline}... In my
> view, credible, sophisticated countermeasures are costly, tough to
> develop, and difficult to make effective against our NMD design.
> Simple, cheap attempts can be readily countered by our system.95

In summary, an adversary is unlikely to know all the relevant
capabilities of the U.S. missile defense system, and given the
consequential nature of a coercive attack on the homeland of the
nuclear-armed United States, the adversary is likely to bias its attack
estimates in favor of the United States, thus contributing to
deterrence.

[Our recent [analysis of]{.mark} hypersonic weapons]{.underline} and
hypersonic defense [looks at the [physics]{.mark}]{.underline} of
missile interception [and [shows]{.mark} that [in contrast to]{.mark}
common [claims, hypersonic]{.mark} weapon[s can be
intercepted]{.mark}]{.underline} by existing terminal defenses.

The [hypersonic [weapons]{.mark} currently being [developed
by]{.mark}]{.underline} the US, Russia, and [[China for conventional
uses have maximum speeds below]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[Mach
10]{.mark}-12]{.underline}. We show that [[the]{.mark} atmospheric
[drag]{.mark}]{.underline} on these weapons as they glide and dive to
targets on the ground [[will slow them enough]{.mark} that they [can be
intercepted by]{.mark} defenses like]{.underline} advanced versions of
the Army's Patriot PAC-3 and [the Navy's [Aegis]{.mark}
SM-6.]{.underline}

This vulnerability was illustrated when Ukraine used PAC-3 to shoot
down multiple incoming Russian Kinzhal missiles, despite their
maneuvering flight at hypersonic speeds.

This means that ships are less vulnerable to hypersonic attack than is
frequently claimed. Ship-based radars could detect approaching
hypersonic weapons at distances of many hundreds of kilometers, which is
more than adequate to fire interceptors at them. Ships with interceptors
similar to advanced PAC-3 and SM-6 systems should therefore be able to
defend themselves from the hypersonic weapons currently being developed.

This finding is supported by a Missile Defense Agency animation showing
a carrier group using ship-based interceptors against hypersonic
weapons. The video shows a ship-based interceptor like SM-6 engaging
hypersonic weapons detected by the ship's radar.

Developing [[faster]{.mark} hypersonic [weapons could]{.mark} help a
country [evade]{.mark} current [interceptors, but]{.mark} would raise
new problems]{.underline}. Faster flight through the atmosphere [[would
lead to]{.mark} much more [intense heating]{.mark} of the
vehicles]{.underline}, which remains the fundamental challenge in
designing these weapons.

[[And]{.mark} at the same time, [countries will be working to develop
increasingly fast]{.mark} and maneuverable
[interceptors]{.mark}]{.underline} to engage the next generation of
hypersonic weapons their adversaries might develop.

Our analysis also shows that [hypersonic [weapons' ability]{.mark} to
maneuver during their glide phase]{.underline}---around defended
regions, for instance---[[is typically exaggerated]{.mark} and comes at
a significant cost]{.underline}.

The [very [high speeds]{.mark}]{.underline} of these weapons [means they
[require]{.mark} very [large]{.mark} aerodynamic [forces to
turn]{.mark}]{.underline}. Generating these forces [increases drag [and
can]{.mark}]{.underline} significantly [[reduce the speed]{.mark} and
range]{.underline} of the weapon.

As an example, consider a Mach 10 weapon that turns by 30o to avoid
overflying a particular location and then turns back by 30o to its
original direction of flight. Under reasonable assumptions, the drag
during this turn would reduce its speed from Mach 10 to about Mach 6 and
reduce its total glide distance to less than 60% of the distance it
could have flown with no turns.

Adding an engine, like a scramjet, could reduce the loss of speed and
range during maneuvers, but [adding an engine and fuel would increase
the weapon's size and mass, requiring a significantly bigger
booster]{.underline} to launch it. Since [scramjets are not a mature
technology]{.underline} and operating them is notoriously complicated,
powered [hypersonic systems will likely be less reliable and more
expensive]{.underline} than boost-glide weapons.

[[Ballistic missiles also fly at hypersonic speeds]{.mark}, and flying
them on depressed trajectories can deliver missiles in
equal]{.underline} or shorter [times than hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}, without the heating problems. Ballistic missiles
delivering warheads that can maneuver in the atmosphere (using
maneuverable reentry vehicles, or MaRVs) can use similar guidance
technologies and have similar accuracy as hypersonic weapons. MaRVs can
also use lift as they reenter the atmosphere to maneuver and re-target
over hundreds of kilometers.

In general, MaRVs launched by ballistic missiles on depressed
trajectories out-perform hypersonic weapons in many scenarios. A recent
analysis by the Congressional Budget Office predicts they would be a
third less expensive than hypersonic weapons.

The hypersonic arms race is likely to increase tensions and military
spending internationally without enhancing national or global security.
[[Hypersonic weapons do not live up to]{.mark} many of [the grandiose
claims]{.mark} about their performance]{.underline}, and there are
better options for gaining the capabilities they do offer. The United
States needs to take a more realistic view of these weapons and the
billions of dollars it is spending on them.

**Miscalculation is a [myth]{.underline}.**

2023, \"The Exculpating Myth of Accidental War,\" Johns Hopkins SAIS,
https://sais.jhu.edu/kissinger/programs-and-projects/kissinger-center-papers/exculpating-myth-accidental-war)

The risk of war by miscalculation is a popular scholarly subject and a
frequent concern of policymakers. [Theories of war by
[miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline} [[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}
either [[ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark} by decisionmakers, [[bad
faith]{.underline}]{.mark} by policy participants (usually the
military), [[or]{.mark} a mechanistic series of [exchanges that
obviate]{.mark} the need for policymakers to display
[judgment]{.mark}]{.underline} and responsibility. Yet [[historians
struggle to produce]{.mark} [evidence that]{.mark} political [leaders
were]{.mark}]{.underline} either [[ignorant]{.mark} of the risks they
were choosing]{.underline} or emasculated from any ability to affect the
course of events. Theories of accidental war are, as Geoffrey Blainey
has said, "a description masquerading as an explanation."\[1\] Instead
of explaining historical events, [the myth of accidental war provides an
intricate puzzle for intellectuals]{.underline}, a justification for
moralists to fear military subversion of political decisionmakers, and
an evasion of culpability for those decisionmakers.

The debate is not esoteric---it has urgent policy applications. U.S.
policy regarding Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine
has been heavily influenced by U.S. President Joe Biden and his
administration's concerns about "a third world war."\[2\] Russia
violated the sovereignty and the internationally recognized territory of
Ukraine, despite its commitment to respect Ukraine's security in the
1995 Budapest Memorandum. Failing to achieve its political objectives on
the battlefield, Russian strategy shifted to targeting civilian
dwellings, destroying infrastructure, and committing mass atrocities.
All of these actions violate Russia's international commitments and
overtly challenge the Biden administration's leadership of the
rules-based international order, as well as its pledge to "stand against
human rights abuses wherever they occur."\[3\]

Although rational calculations of power ought to dictate Russian
aversion to expanding the war from a trajectory of losing to Ukraine to
one of more rapidly and decisively losing should the United States
become a direct combatant, the Biden team's policy is predicated on
concerns that uncontrollable escalation could result from U.S.
assistance to Ukraine. To avoid an accidental war with Russia, the Biden
administration has defended the international order by timidly
progressing from declining before and in the early stages of the
invasion to provide weapons to Ukraine because they would quickly end up
in Russian hands if Russia won as expected, to refusing to provide
"offensive weapons," to providing "offensive weapons" but not those that
could reach Russian territory, to providing weapons that could reach
Russian territory but making Ukraine promise not to use them at those
ranges, to allowing Ukraine to target Russian forces in Crimea, to
providing tanks and training in the United States.\[4\] Out of concern
the United States could unavoidably be drawn into direct combat against
Russia, the strongest power in the international order is conveying the
limits of its interest to a violent transgressor losing a war against a
lesser power.

The idea of accidental war also influences U.S. policy toward China, the
"pacing challenge" in its great power rivalry, according to the Biden
administration's October 2022 National Security Strategy.\[5\] The
United States publicizes Chinese infractions, like the construction of
island military bases in the South China Sea, but does not enforce
compliance. And China is playing that concern to its advantage,
undertaking demonstrations of its willingness to violate U.S.
sovereignty, initiating dangerous military incidents, explaining
provocations as its military acting without political knowledge, and
refusing to answer military hotline calls during crises. [This shows
that the errant notion that war happens unaccountably, that political
leaders are powerless to prevent escalation, that militaries will act
independently of political control and blunder states into conflict has
immediate policy relevance]{.underline}. The idea that war happens by
accident is prejudicing U.S. policy toward self-deterrence; national
security experts should instead be more concerned about deliberate
choices for war as they think about deterrence and escalation control.

What Is Meant by Accidental War?

It is very difficult to know with precision the combination of political
commitment to objectives, military power, the ability to marshal
economic resources, and the social fortitude that combatants possess
until they fight. Blainey persuasively has argued that war is how
relative power is determined in the international order.\[6\] As Carl
von Clausewitz explained and Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrates,
war is a gambling game. If accidental war means nothing more than
leaders misjudging their relative power, then every war is a mistake.
This is because, as Blainey has concluded, "war is usually the outcome
of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have
conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."\[7\]

Strikingly, across nearly eighty years of the nuclear age . . . there
have been few accidents, and none of them led to an automatic escalation
or failure by political and military leaders to make judgments dampening
the prospects of war.

To be intellectually useful, a robust definition of accidental war
matters. At its most basic, accidental war could be mischance---a
confused signal, the technical failure of a weapon, or the accidental
launch of a missile. Alexander George has termed this kind of scenario
"inadvertent war."\[8\] It is striking [that [across]{.mark} nearly
[eighty years]{.mark} of the nuclear age, [incorporating U.S. and Soviet
arsenals]{.mark} in the tens of thousands [and less developed
countries]{.mark} designing indigenous arsenals and delivery systems,
[there have been few accidents, and none]{.mark}]{.underline} of them
[[led to]{.underline}]{.mark} an automatic [[escalation]{.mark} or
failure]{.underline} by political and military leaders [to make
judgments dampening the prospects of war.]{.underline}

But although scholars engaging in the debate use the terms accidental
and inadvertent war interchangeably, genuine inadvertence is mostly not
what is meant in the debate about accidental war; rather, mostly what is
meant is willful subversion of political intent.\[9\] George
distinguished inadvertent from accidental war, defining the latter as
"one that starts because of unauthorized activities by individuals below
the leadership level in the chain of command."\[10\] Meanwhile, Marc
Trachtenberg has defined accidental war as "one in which the political
process--- a process that would normally lead to a peaceful settlement
of the dispute at hand---is overwhelmed by forces welling up from within
the military sphere . . . If the political leaders thought the risks
were relatively limited, but the military structure in place created a
much greater level of risk in time of crisis, then one could conceivably
have what, from the point of view of the political leadership, would be
an 'accidental war.'"\[11\] Scott Sagan also has narrowed the aperture
of unauthorized activities to the military, defining wars as accidental
only when "there would have to be some activity or incident inside the
military machine, without which war would not have occurred."\[12\]

The idea of accidental war has been of particular interest to political
scientists rather than historians, which seems a significant
detail---the experts on concepts are intrigued, [the experts of the
[case studies find no corroborating examples]{.mark}]{.underline}. No
less a source than the distinguished military historian Michael Howard
has rejected the idea, writing, "if history shows any record of
'accidental' wars, I have yet to find them."\[13\]

[[An exhaustive study]{.underline}]{.mark} by Evan Luard [of wars dating
[from 1400 CE to 1985 did not turn up a single case]{.mark} of
accidental inception]{.underline}.\[14\] Sagan, a political scientist
and proponent of the accidental war idea, has admitted as much,
acknowledging, "in the major works by historians on the causes of war,
however, the whole idea of accidental war is either conspicuous by its
absence or explicitly dismissed as conceptually confused and
historically irrelevant."\[15\]

Barry [Posen]{.underline} writes that following "large-scale
conventional attacks on nuclear forces," target states could choose
"dangerous...responses that actually employed nuclear weapons, ranging
from limited demonstrative or tactical employment, through large-scale
theater attacks, to fullscale counterforce exchanges."5 James
[Acton]{.underline} maintains that threats to use nuclear weapons
following an attack on dual-capable systems "could trigger an escalation
cycle."6 He also writes that "\[t\]hese steps could feed an escalation
spiral or even precipitate nuclear use." Thomas
[Christensen]{.underline} writes that "if strikes by the United States
on China's conventional coercive capabilities or their critical command
and control nodes and supporting infrastructure were to appear in
Beijing as a conventional attack on its nuclear retaliatory capability
or as a precursor to a nuclear first strike, even a China that generally
adheres to a No-First-Use posture might escalate to the nuclear level."7
Thomas [Mahnken]{.underline} and Gillian [Evans]{.underline} write that
"\[w\]hen countries complicate efforts to distinguish nuclear from
conventional forces, they invite a higher risk of unintended vertical
escalation and limited nuclear war."8 Tong [Zhao]{.underline} writes
that, in these situations, leaders "will have to decide whether to
launch preemptive strikes before fleeting windows of opportunity close.
Risky decision making would be encouraged."9 Rebecca
[Hersman]{.underline} worries about the "informational aspects of
conventional-nuclear entanglement and the implications for unexpected

[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}s that "[[threats to nuclear

escalation as their least bad option."12

[[But, why? What is the logical reason]{.mark} why [a leader]{.mark} or

Sagan's case for World War I , with Chancellor Theobald von
Bethmann-Hollweg losing control of policymaking, accords well with
Blainey's and Trachtenberg's critiques of accidental war. Trachtenberg
rightly has pointed out that [the [fundamental assumption is false
of]{.mark} theories of [war by miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}, "if
only we can bring ourselves to calculate more accurately, we could
greatly reduce the risk of war."\[26\] It is an unreasonable expectation
that anyone can assess risk and the perceived risk of adversaries with
precision or even fidelity. As he said of the German government at the
inception of World War I, "control and discipline were less than
perfect, but this is the way states actually operate, and this kind of
thing should be taken as the norm."\[27\] Theories that rely on perfect
information and the lack of friction are failed theories.

Japan's Invasion of Manchuria

Bitter policy disputes between civilian and military leaders in Japan
were already resulting in assassinations in the 1920s; by 1930, the
military was the dominant political force in the country, and its assent
was necessary for any government. In 1931, the Japanese military
fomented an incident in Mukden as a pretext for invading all of
Manchuria, ignoring orders from the Japanese imperial government.

But the military's actions were consistent with the widely accepted view
within the Japanese government that control of all Manchuria was
essential to the prosperity of Japan. Nor was insubordination by
overseas Japanese military commanders uncommon, as Niall Ferguson has
noted.\[28\] Blainey has pointed out that the Japanese government "did
not recall nor demote the officer activists," instead defying the League
of Nations' demand that they retreat, thereby legitimating the
military's decisions and suggesting either that the invasion was in line
with the government's objectives or that civilian leaders were dependent
on the military.\[29\]

The initiative taken by rebellious officers in Manchuria may have been
premature, but it was consistent with the consensus in the Japanese
government that control of Manchuria was essential to Japanese security
and prosperity.

I share Sagan's judgment that the Japanese military's unauthorized 1931
attack in Mukden "is perhaps the most clear-cut historical example" of
accidental war and a cautionary tale about the rise of militarism in
Japan.\[30\] The risk is, however, unextrapolateable to societies in
which the military is under civilian control. The invasion of Manchuria
was essentially a military coup against the Japanese government, and it
threatened to be extended to the Japanese home islands too if the
military's demands were not met. This is most accurately seen in the
context of the 1932 military coup in Japan than in isolation as an
accidental war. I am less confident than Sagan that "war would have been
avoided" without the military's unauthorized actions in China, though,
given the sweep of Japanese ambitions and Japan's other, authorized
military occupations.\[31\] The initiative taken by rebellious officers
in Manchuria may have been premature, but it was consistent with the
consensus in the Japanese government that control of Manchuria was
essential to Japanese security and prosperity.

Seven Days in May

Explanations of wars that hinge on military leaders subverting political
directions or lacking the elegance of understanding that civilians
possess became particularly influential in the aftermath of World War
II, a time that coincides with the dawn of the nuclear age. Concerns
about accidental war were particularly acute after the Soviet Union
crossed the nuclear threshold. While fears of surprise attacks were not
new, nuclear weapons changed decision calculations by offering the
prospect of surprise attacks on a society-destroying scale.\[32\] Great
power relations were particularly fraught as the United States and
Soviet Union tested each other's interests and determined the practice
of deterrence in the nuclear age.

Three important transitions took place at the time related to the risks
of military supersedence of political authority, and these concerns gave
widespread influence to the idea of accidental war starting around 1960.
The first transition was the introduction of nuclear weapons, which
could produce devastation on a scale previously unimaginable by a single
decision and use. Then president Dwight D. Eisenhower worried about
accidental war in the nuclear age; Trachtenberg has attributed this to
Eisenhower's concern about nonchalant attitudes about nuclear weapons,
but my guess is that the idea more likely stemmed from his rich
experience of things going wrong in combat and genuine intellectual
wrestling with the meaning of weapons of such destructive
magnitude.\[33\] Even before the advent of permissive action links and
tightened nuclear release procedures, accidental wars were both
desperately feared but not in evidence.

The second transition was the advent of civilian strategists,
predominantly academics with economics training. Civilians brought a
ratio-centric perspective to the work of defense planning. Schelling,
the intellectual architect of so much deterrence theory, worried early
on about accidental war. He later professed that he was mystified at the
unwillingness of war game participants in the 1960s to cross the nuclear
threshold even when it meant losing a conventional war.\[34\] The
"competition in risk-taking" he identified has been voluntarily
constrained by policymakers because of the magnitude of the consequences
in the nuclear age.\[35\] This development suggests that the more
significant the consequences, the more cautious policymakers tend to be,
therefore making accidental war less likely.

And the third transition was the coming of age of politicians who had
little or no military experience of World War II, a generational change
that politically advantaged derogating the superior credentials of the
military leaders who had planned and fought the war. Most American
policymakers who had fought World War II, particularly those who had
been senior military officers, considered nuclear weapons merely an
extension of conventional power for planning and operations purposes.
This culture clash with the military is best summed up in Alain Enthoven
rebutting a senior military planner by saying "General, I've fought just
as many nuclear wars as you have."\[36\] Nor was Enthoven an
unrepresentative case. Herman Kahn also argued that the nuclear age was
wholly novel, saying, "the unrealized and unexperienced, but
historically plausible, problems of World Wars III and IV are more
valuable than the experienced problems of World Wars I and II."\[37\]

Although the American military has routinely passed both those tests,
the theory of accidental war casts a shadow of doubt about their
reliability.

There are two significant tests of civilian control of the military in
the American system: the first is whether elected leaders can ignore
military recommendations, and the second is whether the military will
carry out policies that elected leaders choose contrary to military
counsel. Although the American military has routinely passed both those
tests, the theory of accidental war casts a shadow of doubt about their
reliability. [Both Eisenhower and Kennedy rejected military advice
during the 1958 and 1961 Berlin crises, and Kennedy did so again during
the]{.underline} 1962 [Cuban Missile Crisis]{.underline}, yet none of
those instances have served to tamp down concerns about military
processes and leaders plunging the nation into wars that political
leaders sought to avoid.

During the 1960 presidential campaign, Eisenhower authorized the sharing
of intelligence photographs of Soviet nuclear forces collected by U-2
overflights. The reaction of William Kaufmann from the Kennedy campaign
was disbelief that they were designing and securing their forces so
sloppily. Despite the recklessness of especially early nuclear practice,
[there have been no accidental nuclear wars or even accidental
conventional wars between major powers in the nuclear age. [Far from
being a fragile balance]{.mark} of terror, [the nuclear age has ushered
in greater caution]{.mark} by the strongest powers and even middle power
diads when engaged in conventional wars.]{.underline}

The Kennedy administration was obsessed with concerns about accidental
war; it was a major driver of the decisions to restrict nuclear launch
authority to the president, to install permissive action links on
weapons, and to embrace the strategy of flexible response.\[38\] These
three transitions---the advent of nuclear weapons, the emergence of
civilian strategists, and distrust of military judgments---were all in
evidence during a Soviet-precipitated crisis over Berlin early in
Kennedy's tenure.

At his first meeting with Kennedy in June 1961, Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev re-issued the ultimatum he had given Eisenhower in 1958:
within six months, Western powers needed to withdraw their forces from
Berlin and make it a demilitarized city or the Soviets would allow East
Germany control of access to it (repudiating the Four Power Pact from
World War II). The Eisenhower administration, operating with the
confidence of a war-winning U.S. president after six years in office,
refused, in a coordinated response with the UK and France. It commenced
military planning for preservation of access to Berlin under the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(SACEUR), General Lauris Norstad.

The Berlin planning encompassed a variety of circumstances in which NATO
forces would prepare "quiet military measures" visible to the Soviets
signaling Western commitment and probe Soviet intentions, but quickly
escalate from conventional conflict to general nuclear war.\[39\]
Eisenhower said publicly:

We are certainly not going to fight a ground war in Europe. What good
would it do to send a few more thousands or indeed even a few divisions
of troops to Europe? I do not see why we would think that we---with
something of a half a million troops, Soviet and some German in East
Germany, with 175 Soviet divisions in that neighborhood---why in the
world would we dream of fighting a ground war? . . . We want to keep
adequate forces and we want to keep as strong in our hearts and our
heads as we do in our military, and then carry forward our policies, our
firmness in supporting our rights, carrying out our responsibilities in
the world, keeping our friends together.\[40\]

Eisenhower's view that a conventional war was sanguinously
pointless---both an unnecessary expense of lives and a sure path to
escalating to nuclear use---was broadly shared in the U.S. military and
was the strongly preferred policy among allies whose countries would be
the conventional battlegrounds.

Norstad supported that view for both strategic and allied reasons during
both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. His debates with
Kennedy and the secretaries of state and defense defined the doctrine
that became flexible response. Norstad's position never varied:

I have always accepted the possibility of limited military action in
Europe, but normal prudence compels us to realize that, although limited
aims may involve only limited effort in other areas of the world, in
this critical, highly sensitive region, the assumption that the more
likely contingency is one short of nuclear or massive non-nuclear attack
does not provide an acceptable basis for planning. A number of our
important NATO allies firmly believe this; it is my own judgment that it
is so.\[41\]

Civilian leadership in the Kennedy administration disagreed; their
concern about accidental war led them to believe that war in Europe
needed to be ratcheted up slowly and conventionally, giving repeated
opportunities for Soviet recalculation. Kennedy described his thinking
to Norstad, saying, "it seems evident to me that our nuclear deterrent
will not be credible to the Soviets unless they are convinced of NATO's
readiness to become engaged on a lesser level of violence and are
thereby made to realize the great risks of escalation to nuclear
war."\[42\]

According to then secretary of defense Robert McNamara, Norstad
responded, "'Graduation' and 'escalation' suggest a serial progression
in which we move easily and by prepared steps from one stage to another
of a development within our own control. This seemed to him unrealistic;
he believed that in normal war escalation is apt to be explosive . . .
The one central point of concern is this: do we intend to use our
nuclear power if necessary?"\[43\]

Norstad tried to finesse the differences, saying, "I have tried to
develop a rather specific line of action which would meet your
requirements and at the same time have a chance of being accepted by our
Allies."\[44\] His proposal was a draft planning document containing the
following guidance:

We must prepare a broad catalog of plans to meet the situation at
ascending levels of political and military involvement, but we must do
so with full awareness that the choice of timing and action rests at
least as much with the Soviets as with us . . . The use of armed force,
even in limited quantity, risks the danger of explosive expansion to
higher levels of conflict, including the highest level. This risk is
accepted, and therefore we stand ready to use all forces and weapons
available . . . This action might be general war, initiated by the West.
If, however, there is reason to believe that the Soviets doubt the
seriousness of the West, or if the Western public is not yet prepared
for such large-scale military action, NATO forces will launch one or
more limited offensive operations . . . The selected, limited-objective
offensive operations discussed above are short-term actions which will
have served their purpose soon after initiation, probably within hours.
By initiating any operation in this category, the commitment of the West
will become complete. Whether this step will lead to general war will be
determined by the Soviet reaction, which may be prompt and total.\[45\]

SACEUR's instructions to military planners at Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe were never issued because, despite several meetings
with the president, the gap was unbridgeable between Norstad's thinking
and the civilian leadership of the Kennedy administration. National
security advisor McGeorge Bundy wrote to the president saying of Norstad
"at root he is a nuclear war man, and all his preferences move
accordingly."\[46\] The president's military advisor, retired general
Maxwell Taylor, advised him that "he is convinced that general nuclear
war will be the inevitable and rapid outcome of any military action to
reopen access to Berlin."\[47\] Then secretary of state Dean Rusk argued
for a delay in responding to any provocation; Norstad countered, "it
will be necessary to act, not wait---to engage ourselves in a
fight---and not to let the interruption of our rights stand
unchallenged. You have to react immediately, in order to see if the
other man means war. Where will your allies be if you wait?"\[48\]

Norstad was accurately reflecting allied concerns that the Kennedy
administration was backing away from the U.S. commitment to extended
deterrence. Whereas the Eisenhower administration considered the
European question to be ensuring Germany's adherence to the West, the
civilian leadership of the Kennedy administration feared an accidental
war and calculated that NATO allies had no other choice than to support
U.S. strategy.\[49\] The State Department optimistically concluded in
1963, "this US discussion has undoubtedly generated some allied
questioning but, on balance, we believe that it has had a constructive
educational effect."\[50\] France, and to a lesser extent Germany, would
prove that wrong.\[51\]

After the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961, the administration
undertook a series of wargames at Camp David to test graduated
escalation; both sides in the game sought accommodation and modification
of their political objectives rather than provocation.\[52\] War by
accident never occurred, even when the stakes were theoretical.

Yet the president and his civilian team continued to fear a reprise of
the German high command's supposed inflexibility in 1914, creating plans
that dragged an unknowing or powerless civilian leadership into
catastrophe. Yet the civilians, not the military, were the prime movers
on decisions; it validated their desire to assert civilian expertise in
defense planning over that of their more experienced military
colleagues.

Although Norstad put into practice the civilian direction on NATO
strategy, McNamara darkly hinted to senior government officials in 1963
that Norstad might start a war.\[53\] Trachtenberg has concluded of
McNamara that "his assumption here was that one could not trust the
military leadership to do the right thing . . . the real problem had to
do with the military authorities, with the way they thought, the way
they operated, the sorts of things they were likely to do if they were
given the authority to do them."\[54\] Sagan's argument about the risk
of accidental war burgeon from the same basis. Both serve to undercut
legitimate military perspectives about the dynamic of conflict.

Saving the World

Two other incidents prominent in discussions of accidental war occurred
in the 1980s. The first alarm over accidental war occurred in 1983, amid
heightened tensions over NATO deployments of intermediate-range nuclear
forces and the Soviet Union's shooting down of a South Korean airliner.
Erroneously alerted by Soviet early warning systems that the United
States had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile salvo out of
the blue, the duty officer, a Soviet lieutenant colonel named Stanislav
Petrov of the Air Defense Forces, disbelieved the information absent
corroboration and declined to launch a retaliatory strike.\[55\] Colonel
Petrov was able to understand the stakes and assess information in the
context of patterns of behavior (the unlikelihood of an unprovoked U.S.
nuclear attack), concluding that restraint was the proper judgment. This
outcome demonstrates that, [even at the tactical and operational level,
[civilian and military actors]{.mark} have the ability to [control
tensions rather than letting events prompt automatic escalation]{.mark}
or having military officers operate on judgments untrustworthy to
civilian leaders.]{.underline}

The second example of a narrow escape from accidental war was a November
1983 NATO nuclear exercise codenamed Able Archer. Designed to rehearse
NATO nuclear alert and release procedures, the exercise simulated a
crisis between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet leadership,
operating on "a potentially lethal combination of Reaganite rhetoric and
Soviet paranoia," feared the exercise was cover for a nuclear attack (as
a KGB defector later described it).\[56\] The Soviets put their nuclear
forces on high alert; U.S. forces noticed the change but did not mirror
the Soviet action, and the so-called crisis passed.\[57\]

Hysteria about Able Archer being the riskiest confrontation since the
1962 Cuban Missile Crisis is not borne out by the facts.\[58\] NATO
predictably conducted this exercise at the same time every year, so the
Soviet leadership had context to anticipate its occurrence. While some
NATO heads of state participated, president Ronald Reagan did not (and
explicitly to prevent Soviet conjecture, according to his national
security advisor, Robert McFarlane).\[59\] Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) analysts at the time concluded that Soviet leaders did not
genuinely fear a U.S. attack (although former CIA director Robert Gates
takes that as analysts failing to understand Soviet thinking).\[60\]
Sourcing for the crisis comes largely from debriefing a Soviet defector,
who had an interest in heightening the drama of his revelations and his
role in preventing escalation. The Soviet military leader of the
operations directorate at the time, Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev, claimed
not to recall Able Archer.\[61\]

The Petrov incident and Able Archer, while often used as cautionary
tales about the fragility of the U.S.-Soviet nuclear peace, actually
demonstrate the robustness of what Eisenhower called "'the stability of
the stalemate.

The Petrov incident and Able Archer, while often used as cautionary
tales about the fragility of the U.S.-Soviet nuclear peace, actually
demonstrate the robustness of what Eisenhower called "the stability of
the stalemate."\[62\] [Far from demonstrating the risk of accidental
war, the incidents indicate the lack of mechanistic escalation and the
wide role for human judgment]{.underline}---and therefore culpability.
As Blainey has summarized, "Perhaps many wars were like traffic
accidents, the result of risky driving by nations rather than the result
of a wish to crash into a rival."\[63\]

War by miscalculation is once again in vogue as worries about support to
Ukraine intensify as Russia's defeat becomes manifest. And once again,
the risk is conjured as a rebuttal to a hard-line policy.\[64\] Biden
and his national security advisor frequently raise the spectre of
needing to avoid World War Three as their justification for rejecting
weapons in high quantities or of increasing Kyiv's capabilities.\[65\]
This shows the detrimental real world significance of a mistaken concept
about the causes of war.

Better strategies would mean taking less counsel of unfounded fears of
accidental war and attempting instead to make clear judgments about
interests, risk tolerance to protect and advance those interests,
strategies for attaining them, and ways of effectively communicating
with adversaries. To take a Ukraine example, rather than conveying to
U.S. adversaries all they are not willing to do and stingily parsing out
assistance to Ukraine out of fear that Russia might escalate to nuclear
use against Kyiv, U.S. officials ought to understand that they have the
ability to affect that choice and act accordingly. They could publicly
state that if the U.S. intelligence community perceives any preparations
for nuclear use, Washington would provide Ukraine the targeting
information and weapons to preempt the Russian attack, or that if the
United States were to fail to preempt it, U.S. officials would send NATO
military teams to Ukraine to help manage the effects---so there would be
NATO military forces stationed in Ukraine, and they would hunt down and
either drag to the Hague or kill everyone involved in the decision and
execution of the order.

The Enduring Popularity of Accidental War

If [the idea of accidental or inadvertent war has been]{.underline} so
[definitively repudiated by]{.underline} the [historical
cases]{.underline}, why, then, does it continue to command such intense
interest?

For starters, this is because such conjecture is fun. Political
scientists play with concepts, teasing out patterns from bodies of
evidence. Theoretial accidental wars are plentiful, even if history
provides no actual examples. Moreover, the notion of war has grown
scarier. The possibility of a single mistake or error of judgment
decimating whole cities or countries, even destroying the world,
intensifies the consequences of single points of failure.

The idea of accidental war also reifies civilian control of military
planning. In almost every example put forward as a case of accidental
war by either political scientists or officials in positions of
authority during wars, the military is blamed as a usurper of political
directives against war or negligence. It is the excuse that political
leaders of the time offered, especially in Germany during World War I.
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin refused to participate in nuclear release
exercises because he feared the military would trick him into an actual
launch.\[66\] To return to the previous Sagan quote, "for a conflict to
be considered an accidental war, there would have to be some activity or
incident inside the military machine, without which war would not have
occurred."\[67\] Civilian mistakes leading to war are thus airbrushed
out of the picture.

The concept also allows leaders to evade culpability. If war were simply
a car crash, that would allow policymakers to avoid responsibility for
their assessments of their own and their adversaries' relative power,
their policy choices on the basis of those assessments, and the
consequences of those choices---in effect encouraging negligence in the
performance of their duties. In this way, British prime minister David
Lloyd George could say "the nations slithered over the brink into the
boiling cauldron of war without any trace of apprehension or dismay,"
and Germany's chancellor could say, "things are out of control \[es ist
die Direktion verloren\]," treating their government's choices as an act
of God or the functioning of a natural force like gravity rather than
political choices that proved disastrous.\[68\] Nor are politicians the
only governmental actors eschewing responsibility for wars' outcomes, as
Germany's military claimed to have been winning the war but to have been
betrayed by politicians in what came to be known as the
"stab-in-the-back" myth or Dolchstoss im Rücken.\[69\]

The concept of accidental war also avoids the question of ideology. War
as an accident also has the benefit of not requiring engagement with the
academically uncomfortable subject of regime type. Historians prefer
unique explanations, and political scientists prefer systemic
explanations. Ideology and religion are cultural factors and therefore
more difficult to grasp. As novelist Orhan Pamuk has cautioned, "even
the most intelligent thinker will, if he talks too long about cultures
and civilizations, begin to spout nonsense."\[70\] Yet it is essential
to understanding government decisions. Brands' important challenge to
the idea of accidental war noted, "World War I was part of the
overarching struggle of the 20th century---the contest between
liberalism and its enemies."\[71\] War as an accident circumvents
messier and more contentious explanations.

Conclusion

Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman's prospect theory gives some support to
concern about war by [[miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their idea,
which explains lucky streaks and losing streaks is that people are
willing to run greater risks to salvage a failing situation than to
improve an already advantageous one.\[72\] Applied to international
relations, [states on the losing side of wars or the disadvantageous
side of crises ought to become desperate and take increasing
risks]{.underline}. But [that [is not what appears]{.mark} to have
happened]{.underline} at least among the great powers---[not [in]{.mark}
the [Berlin]{.mark} crises, or in the [Cuba]{.mark}n Missile Crisis,
[or]{.mark} during [the]{.mark} 1956 [Hungarian
uprising]{.mark}]{.underline}. In those cases, billed as the most
fraught superpower confrontations of the nuclear age, [both [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark} accurately gauged their relative strength and
[[reached]{.mark} political [settlements or conceded to avoid
war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Moreover, manipulating risk is a strategy, not an accident. For example,
former secretary of state Henry Kissinger's elevation of nuclear alert
levels during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war---something shockingly
undertaken without presidential approval---was using the risk of nuclear
war to prevent an adversary's support to a fighting proxy. If that
incident had produced war, it would taxonomically have qualified as a
failed strategy, not an accidental war. As Trachtenberg has concluded,
"the basic point here is that [states]{.underline}, by and large, do
[know what they are doing]{.underline}; to a certain extent, [they burn
their bridges in the course of a crisis, but they do this with important
political objectives in mind]{.underline}."\[73\]

[[States]{.mark} can and do [choose to de-escalate; there is no
automatic ratchet to]{.mark} upward [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example, president Barack [[Obama declined to honor the red
line]{.mark} drawn [against]{.mark} Syrian use of [chemical
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2012.\[74\] [[Even]{.mark} the most
reckless of]{.underline} recent vintage American
[presidents]{.underline}, Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, [was able
to make reasonable risk calculations]{.underline} in crises, [by
[backing away at]{.mark} great [reputational cost from striking
Iran]{.mark} to retaliate]{.underline} for Iranian attacks on Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\[75\]

#### The inadvertent war hypothesis defies [history]{.underline} and [logic]{.underline}. 

**Quackenbush 23**, PhD, Associate Professor and Director of Defense and
Strategic Studies in the Truman School of Government and Public Affairs
at the University of Missouri. (Stephen L., 2-2-2023, \"The problem with
accidental war,\" Conflict Management and Peace Science, Volume 40,
Issue 6, https://doi.org/10.1177/07388942221149672)

Why the focus on accidental war?

So why do scholars continue to talk about the possibility of accidental
or inadvertent war even in the face of logic and evidence against it?
Trachtenberg (2000: 23) argues that the crucial reason is not because
these scholars are dishonest or stupid, it is that "[[people want to
believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that the military system can be a major
cause for war." They want to believe that rigid war plans, [[renegade
military officers]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}/or
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} reciprocal [[fear of surprise
attack]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[pose]{.mark} serious [threats
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the prospects for [[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are additional motivations for the focus on accidental war in the
literature. A number of [scholars]{.underline} writing in the later
years of the Cold War [wanted to argue against the prevailing view that
nuclear weapons are inherently stabilizing]{.underline} (e.g. Blair,
1993; Feaver, 1992; Sagan, 1993). Given that nuclear command and control
systems are prone to false early warnings and other failures, they
argued that accidents are a regular occurrence and accidental war is
almost inevitable eventually. Thus, nuclear proliferation is very
dangerous (Sagan, 2003), in contrast to claims that proliferation is not
so bad since nuclear weapons are pacifying (Waltz, 2003).

And from a game-theoretic perspective, accidental war is the crucial
mechanism needed to explain how wars can happen even though they are
irrational. If war is everyone\'s worst possible outcome, then no one
will choose to go to war. Given that wars actually do occur, there are
only two basic explanations from a rational choice perspective: either
war is irrational and can only be reached accidentally, or war is
reached through rational decision-making and is thus not irrational. Of
course, saying that war is rational is not equivalent to saying that war
is desirable. For example, in Prisoner\'s Dilemma, the equilibrium
outcome of mutual defection is Pareto sub-optimal, meaning that it is
quite explicitly both rational and not desirable.

As both Blainey (1973) and Trachtenberg (2000) point out, political
scientists have been more likely to accept the idea of accidental war
than historians. Perhaps this is related to the debate over rationality,
which is more common among political scientists than historians. If one
has difficulty accepting that choosing war is a rational course of
action for leaders to follow, then accidental or inadvertent war is a
clear way to avoid that conundrum (Rhodes, 1989).

However, instrumental rationality---which is the type of rationality
assumed by game theory---is determined by decision makers' preferences,
not by whether others find those preferences to be reasonable
(Quackenbush, 2004). So whether or not analysts---political scientists
or otherwise---find it reasonable to prefer to go to war in a crisis
rather than back down has no bearing on whether or not it is rational
for leaders to do so. What do matter are the preferences of the leaders
and the strategic interaction they find themselves involved in.

Consequences for theory

Given not only the lack of evidence that World War I or other wars were
truly accidental or inadvertent, but also the evidence that World War I
and other supposedly accidental wars actually resulted from leaders'
deliberate decisions to go to war rather than avoid it, I argue that we
should not base our theories on assumptions that war starts accidentally
or inadvertently. What effect does it have on international relations
theory if we do not assume that wars can occur by accident?

One clear ramification is that classical deterrence theory is untenable.
Classical deterrence theory is based on the assumption that states have
Chicken-like preferences because conflict is the worst outcome for
everyone (Powell, 1990; Schelling, 1960). Assuming that everyone prefers
to back down rather than fight creates a tremendous problem with how to
explain deterrence, because it either creates logical inconsistency or
has to be based on questionable assumptions that war happens by chance,
not choice (Quackenbush, 2011a). Fortunately, perfect deterrence theory
(Zagare, 2011; Zagare and Kilgour, 2000) provides an alternative
explanation of deterrence that is not only logically consistent, it is
also empirically supported (Quackenbush, 2010, 2011b).

More broadly, game-theoretic models that call for war to be reached
through a move by Nature are called into question, particularly if that
is the only way war can be reached in the model. Game theory is a
powerful tool that can be used to analyze strategic interaction between
states in the international system and explain leaders\' choices
regarding a wide range of possible actions in international politics,
including the decision to go to war. But having Nature choose war,
rather than an actual decision-maker, prevents one from being able to
explain leaders' decisions to go to war.

A recognition that accidental wars rarely if ever happen also calls for
reassessing theories across the board that are based on the
accidental/inadvertent war interpretation of World War I---particularly
since [the evidence is]{.underline} quite [clear that]{.underline}
[World War I was not accidental]{.underline}. Trachtenberg (2000: 24)
argues about the lessons of the July 1914 crisis, "[people have drawn
the wrong lessons]{.underline}, lessons about how the military system
created a situation where the political process was overwhelmed, about
how generals had to be kept on a short leash, [about the great risk of
things spinning out of control]{.underline} for military reasons, [about
miscalculation]{.underline} and ignorance and all their horrifying
consequences." Similarly, Lieber (2007) also focuses on how [[mistaken
interpretations of World War I have shaped]{.underline}]{.mark} much of
[i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[theory]{.underline}, [including [defensive
realism]{.mark},]{.underline} the security dilemma, the spiral model,
and offense--defense theory. Correcting those interpretations
"undermines security dilemma, spiral model, and offense--defense
explanations for the outbreak of war" (Lieber, 2007: 191).

[Consider [the spiral model]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jervis, 1976). A
central element of the spiral model is that states are uncertain about
whether other states want to maintain the status quo or are seeking to
expand (Glaser, 1992). "[The danger is that each side will incorrectly
see the other as a menace]{.underline} to its vital interests [and will
inadvertently encourage this belief by relying on threats to prevent
war]{.underline}" (Jervis, 1988: 685). Because of the reciprocal fear of
surprise attack, this can lead to preemptive war (Schelling, 1960). This
is problematic empirically, because "preemptive wars almost never
happen" (Reiter, 1995: 5). It is also specifically based on World War I;
Jervis (1988: 685) even calls it "the spiral or World War I model."
However, as Lieber (2007), Trachtenberg (1990/1991; 1991a), and Zagare
(2011) all demonstrate, the idea that the July Crisis spiraled out of
control [[is based on an outdated understanding of
history.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Another area of theory that would need rethinking would be arms races.
Concerns that arms races can lead to war are often connected to
assumptions that such a war could start by accident (Intriligator and
Brito, 1984; Trachtenberg, 1991b; Wallace et al., 1986). Thus, it is
important to determine whether that connection still stands logically
without accidental war as a mechanism.

Conclusions

In this article, I have examined the validity of the assumption that
wars can begin by accident. I discussed the danger of accidents and the
expected risk of accidental war, particularly nuclear war. I also
examined how accidental war is used as a theoretical mechanism, focusing
on theories of deterrence. And I explored the empirical question of
whether accidental wars actually occur.

This analysis has made it clear that [the idea of]{.underline}
accidental or [[inadvertent war is contradicted by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}. While accidents do indeed happen,
and have happened on the road to war in multiple cases, [[there is no
example of]{.mark} a [war occurring as the result of an accident]{.mark}
rather than decisions to go to war]{.underline}. In other words, there
are no wars that have occurred following the process laid out in Figure
3, which is precisely the process assumed by Powell (1990), Nalebuff
(1986), and many others. [The idea of accidental war is]{.underline}
also [problematic logically, since [the way to logically link an
accident]{.mark} or inadvertent act [to war is to show how
decision-makers chose to go to war, which makes the war]{.mark} in turn
[result from choice]{.mark}, not accident]{.underline}. This is the
process laid out in Figure 4, and while a few wars have followed this
form, they are not accidental or inadvertent wars because [leaders
deliberately decided to enter]{.underline} into [them]{.underline}.

Starting an "Arms Race"

Perhaps [the most common [response to]{.mark}]{.underline} proposals to
improve and expand US [homeland [missile defenses
is]{.mark}]{.underline} that such action [[would]{.mark} inevitably
[prompt]{.mark} an adversary reaction]{.underline} in the form of
producing greater numbers of offensive missiles [to overwhelm the
defensive system]{.underline}. According to this line of thought, at
best the action-reaction cycle will be a waste of resources for no net
gain in security, and, at worst, the action-reaction cycle will continue
unchecked and deepen the sense of security loss, [leading to [an arms
race]{.mark}]{.underline}, worsened political relations, [[and]{.mark}
potentially [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[While simple to understand]{.underline} as a concept, [the
offense-defense, [action-reaction]{.mark} construct [lacks a]{.mark}
substantial [historical foundation]{.mark} for its
claims]{.underline}.34 For instance, [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates continued to [improve]{.mark} and expand [its]{.mark}
homeland missile [defenses after withdrawing from]{.mark} the
[ABM]{.mark} Treaty [in 2002, and]{.mark} yet]{.underline}---contrary to
the action-reaction hypothesis---[[Russia did not]{.mark} engage in an
[arms race]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States to overcome those
defenses.35 Indeed, [[during that]{.mark} time [period, Russia
engaged]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States [[in]{.mark}
agreeing to [multiple]{.mark} nuclear arms control [treaties]{.mark}
while [knowing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [these treaties [would
not]{.mark}]{.underline} substantially [[limit US]{.mark} homeland
missile [defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}.36 As Ambassador Robert Joseph
has observed, "while the conclusion of the ABM Treaty in 1972 led to the
largest Soviet strategic nuclear build-up in history...the U.S.
withdrawal from the treaty 30 years later was followed by an actual
decrease in Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal."37 [US actions on
[missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[are not]{.mark} as
tightly [linked to Russian reactions]{.mark} as the arms race hypothesis
would suggest]{.underline}.

Russian [officials play up]{.mark} purported
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to their nuclear forces from US homeland
missile defenses [when it suits their needs]{.underline}, but often
dismiss such threats and the risk of an arms race.40

Critics may respond that Russia may not fit the action-reaction
hypothesis, but China's vast nuclear expansion beginning around 2021
appears to conform to the predicted reaction. Yet, even in this case,
[it is far from clear]{.underline} that [the primary driver of China's
nuclear expansion is]{.underline} an (unrealized) expansion in US
[homeland missile defenses]{.underline}. Indeed, the Biden
administration signaled its reticence to significantly expand US
homeland missile defenses in its "2022 Missile Defense Review,"
reiterating that it sought to deter Chinese strikes on the homeland with
US nuclear forces alone. Moreover, gone is the concept of "layered"
homeland missile defense from that review and official Biden
administration talking points. Adding to the unlikelihood that US
homeland missile defenses are the primary driver of China's nuclear
missile buildup is the fact that [[China's]{.mark} nuclear [forces began
growing]{.mark} rapidly [all at once]{.mark}--- making a break from the
slow and steady buildup of decades past]{.underline}. Indeed, [the
[action-reaction]{.mark} hypothesis [would predict]{.mark} that, as the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates made [incremental improvements
to]{.mark} its homeland [missile defenses, China]{.mark} would [react
in]{.mark} a [similar manner. Instead, China made a sharp break]{.mark}
from past practice, [indicating]{.mark} an [internal change]{.mark} in
policy [rather than a reaction]{.mark} to unrealized US homeland missile
defense advances.]{.underline}

#### No crisis instability\-\--even if missile defense makes a first strike easier, [deterrence will hold]{.underline}.

Sparking International Conflict

The second [major [counterargument to]{.mark}]{.underline} improving and
[expanding US homeland [missile defenses is]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[doing so [might spark fears in China and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
that the United States was gaining a significant military advantage. For
China's and Russia's leaderships, this military advantage might be so
severe and enduring [that it would]{.underline} become unacceptable and
[require a correction]{.underline} or minimization [through military
force--- be it a first strike]{.underline} or limited strikes.
[According to this]{.underline} line of [reasoning, China and/or Russia
would feel compelled to]{.underline} either [prevent]{.underline} or
disrupt [US improvements]{.underline} or expansion [of its homeland
missile defenses because, if they became fully operational, they could
threaten their continued existence]{.underline}. Often [[implicit in
this]{.mark} criticism [is the belief]{.mark}]{.underline} that expanded
and improved [US homeland [missile defenses]{.mark} could
[enable]{.mark} a successful [US first strike]{.mark} against Beijing or
Moscow, [or]{.mark}, at least, [it may appear that way in each]{.mark}
respective [capital]{.mark}---thus [requiring preemptive
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Here too, [[there is little]{.mark} historical [evidence to support
this]{.mark} criticism. The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, for instance, [[had]{.mark} a clear
[first-strike]{.mark} capability [against]{.mark} the [Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline} for over a decade early on in the Cold War,
[[and]{.mark} yet it [chose not to employ]{.mark} that
capability]{.underline}. Indeed, [[China]{.mark} itself has
[existed]{.mark}]{.underline} for decades [[with]{.mark} its "[minimum
deterrence]{.mark}" nuclear force [in]{.mark} the [shadow of]{.mark}
a]{.underline} nominal [[US first strike]{.mark} capability,
[and]{.mark} yet it [did not]{.mark} believe it had to [take]{.mark}
drastic [action]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, as the acquisition
history of major US weapon systems demonstrates, [[any]{.mark}
significant [change in]{.mark}]{.underline} policy and [[capability
is]{.mark} likely to be [measured in decades, making]{.mark} the [need
for sudden]{.mark} and drastic decisions (such as preemptive
[war]{.mark} with the United States) in Beijing and Moscow seem
[unfounded]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Finally, [[the notion]{.mark} that a nation like [Russia or China
would]{.mark} opt for a nuclear [first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}
against the United States during a crisis simply [[because it
feared]{.mark} that [going second]{.mark} would [leave it at]{.mark} a
[disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline} in the nuclear balance [strains
credulity. It [would be irrational]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this
scenario, [for a nuclear power [to strike a]{.mark}nother nuclear [power
that had survivable]{.mark} nuclear [forces, which is the case
for]{.mark} Russia, China, and the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. As one scholar has asked, [why would China
intentionally start a devastating nuclear war against the United States
because it feared losing a devastating nuclear war against the United
States]{.underline} if it waited?41 Indeed, beginning a nuclear war for
fear of eventually losing a future (potential) nuclear war would be to
commit suicide for fear of death.

#### Even if deterrence [isn't perfect]{.underline}, missile defense prevents [accidental conflict]{.underline}. 

**Lowry 25**, Editor at the National Review (Rich Lowry, May 29, 2025,
"Golden Dome and Its Enemies," National Review,
https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/golden-dome-and-its-enemies/)

Both premises are false. If deterrence always worked we'd have many
fewer wars. But the [[fact is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[one]{.mark}
country [may misunderstand]{.mark}]{.underline} what [[another
country]{.underline}]{.mark} truly values, [and]{.underline} therefore
[misunderstand what it takes to deter it.]{.underline}

[Plus, [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [[start]{.mark} a
[conflict for]{.mark}]{.underline} reasons --- national [[honor,]{.mark}
ethnic [hatred]{.mark} --- [that aren't]{.mark}]{.underline} susceptible
to the influence of [[normal incentives]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[For all]{.mark} that [we believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[MAD
worked]{.underline}]{.mark} brilliantly [during the Cold War, [if a few
things]{.mark} had [bounced differently]{.mark}]{.underline} during the
Cuban Missile Crisis, [[we'd all think it]{.mark} was an abject
[failure]{.mark}]{.underline} that cratered our society.

[[Missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark} isn't a substitute for
deterrence, but [[strengthens it]{.mark}. If an adversary can't be
sure]{.underline} that [it will penetrate our defenses]{.underline} even
if it launches against us, [the calculations change]{.underline}. Why
would North Korea want to risk everything on a potentially failed
attack? Why would China want to escalate in a conflict over Taiwan by
hitting Los Angeles, if it can't be sure it really can hit Los Angeles?

**Heinrichs 16**, Senior Fellow and Director, Keystone Defense
Initiative, M.A., National Security, US Naval War College (Rebecca L.
Heinrichs, July 22, 2016, "The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System:
Myths and Facts," Hudson Institute,
https://www.hudson.org/national-security-defense/the-ground-based-midcourse-defense-system-myths-and-facts)

[[MYTH]{.mark} #4: [Missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if
technically possible, [[is destabilizing]{.mark} and creates an
incentive for adversaries to invest]{.underline} in their [offensive
missile forces]{.underline}.

[FACT: Missile [defense]{.mark} systems are [not the cause of
adversaries']{.mark}]{.underline} offensive missile
[[programs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, U.S. [missile defense systems
are]{.underline} developed and deployed [in response to]{.underline} the
present and constantly developing threats posed by [adversaries'
offensive missiles]{.underline}. It is because the United States has
remained exposed to the threat of ballistic missile attack that rogue
countries like Iran and North Korea seek a nuclear ballistic missile as
a relatively affordable means of coercing much more capable adversaries.
[The [more effective]{.mark}]{.underline} and robust [the [BMDS]{.mark},
the [less likely countries are to devote resources to]{.mark} long-range
[missile]{.mark} program[s]{.mark} to coerce the United States, [since
they believe]{.mark} the [defensive system will]{.mark} be able to
[neutralize]{.mark} a [first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than
scaling back U.S. strategic missile defense, the United States should
devote significant resources to currently operational systems so that
they can fulfill their technical potential, and to next-generation
technologies to work towards a more robust defensive capability.5 An
additional GMD site, with more GBIs at existing sites, would increase
the reliability of the current system, even as the MDA continues to
improve the accuracy of its EKVs. Additional radar will also improve the
accuracy of the system and must be supported and deployed as soon as
possible.

[[Russia often claims]{.mark} that current U.S. [missile defense]{.mark}
plans and deployments [pose a threat]{.mark} to strategic
stability]{.underline} and therefore create a need for increased
investments in offensive capabilities. [[However]{.mark}, Russia has not
always made this claim. [When]{.mark}]{.underline} President [[Bush
withdrew]{.mark} the]{.underline} United States from the
[[ABM]{.underline}]{.mark} Treaty in 2002, President Vladimir [[Putin
stated:]{.mark} "I can say with full confidence]{.underline} that the
decision made by the President of [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[does not pose a threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to the national security of
the Russian Federation." He went on to express his commitment to further
nuclear arms reductions.6 [[National objectives]{.mark} unique to each
country [and strategic relationships]{.mark} between countries
[determine how each]{.mark} nation's leaders [decide]{.mark} on the
[kind of weapons]{.mark} they [will develop]{.mark} and deploy. [Russia
is objecting]{.mark} to U.S. missile defense plans as a means [to
further its]{.mark} own foreign [policy goals]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
so now is China. [U.S. acquiescence]{.underline} to their demands to
curb defensive plans [only encourages]{.underline} China and [Russia
continue to object to future deployments]{.underline} and leaves the
United States unnecessarily exposed to missile threats.

#### Modernization arguments bely simple math.

**Geller 21**, Policy Analyst, Nuclear Deterrence, the Heritage
Foundation (Patty Geller, September 23, 2021, "Improved missile defense
essential to countering North Korea, Iran," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/573554-improved-missile-defense-essential-to-countering-north-korea-iran/)

For one, [[the admin]{.mark}istration [plans]{.mark} to field [only 20
NGIs]{.mark} to augment]{.underline} the current inventory of [44
ground-based interceptors. [That]{.mark} deployment [could not possibly
defuse Russia's arsenal of]{.mark} around [1,550]{.mark}
warheads]{.underline} deployed on hundreds of ground-, sea- and
air-based platforms. [[Such is simple math]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Similarly, [[the notion]{.mark} that [adding 20
more]{.mark}]{.underline} interceptors by the end of the decade
[[is]{.mark} somehow [driving Beijing's]{.mark} strategic [breakout is
nonsensical]{.mark}]{.underline}. So is the idea that 64 interceptors
could keep pace with the burgeoning [[Chinese missile
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is]{.mark} now [expected
to exceed Russia's]{.mark} capabilities [as]{.mark} China
[builds hundreds of new]{.mark} missile [silos]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[To change]{.mark} the strategic [stability]{.mark} calculus [with
Russia and China]{.mark} would [require much larger]{.mark} numbers of
[interceptors, which]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has no
plans to]{.mark} acquire]{.underline}.

#### Modernization is wrong\-\--other factors are determinative and missile defense won't cause fast breakouts. 

**Costlow 22**, Senior Analyst, National Institute for Public Policy,
Ph.D. Candidate, George Mason (Matthew Costlow, 2022, "Vulnerability is
No Virtue and Defense is No Vice: The Strategic Benefits of Expanded
U.S. Homeland Missile Defense," NIPP, Occasional Paper, Vol. 2, No. 9,
https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OP-Vol.-2-No.-9.pdf)

Misunderstanding the Nature of Arms Competitions. [[The
assertion]{.mark} that building improved U.S. homeland [missile
defenses]{.mark} will likely [cause an arms race]{.mark} is based on
assumptions]{.underline}, much like the criterion on cost effectiveness,
that adversaries will react in the particular manner, and for the
reasons, that critics posit. [But]{.underline}, as demonstrated above,
[[history demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[opponents]{.mark}
have [responded]{.mark} very [differently]{.mark}]{.underline} from what
critics have asserted as being virtually inevitable. In fact, [[there is
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark} either automatic or [[predictable
about]{.mark} what [weapons]{.mark} a state develops]{.underline}, why,
and when. This dynamic indicates that real world [defense [acquisition
is driven by]{.mark} far [more]{.mark} factors [than simply
reacting]{.mark} to]{.underline} what [the United States]{.underline} is
doing. [[Russia, China]{.mark}, and [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea all
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} their own [[domestic]{.mark}ally-driven
[considerations]{.mark} (bureaucratic [power struggles, funding]{.mark}
battles, budget limits, [tech]{.mark}nical capability), ideological
considerations (how]{.underline} particular [weapons represent the
[state's status]{.mark}]{.underline} on the world stage, contribution to
[[grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}, a weapon's potential
[[propaganda]{.mark} value), [and]{.mark} operational considerations
(geographic limitations, contribution to short-term]{.underline}
military [goals, synchronization]{.underline} with other defense
programs, [[infrastructure]{.mark} delays). The fact]{.underline} that
[Russia and China developed ICBM-centric nuclear arsenals while the
United States developed an SLBM-centric nuclear arsenal]{.underline},
and the long-standing difference in overall force size levels, [is
indication enough]{.underline} that there is no mechanistic relationship
between U.S. defense priorities and those of other states.

It is especially important to note in this regard that even if Russia or
China directly increase their missile arsenals in response to an
expanded and improved U.S. homeland missile defense system, that in and
of itself would not negate the value of the system. Since the system
would be designed to deter and defeat coercive attacks against the U.S.
homeland, larger Russian or Chinese arsenals per se would not
necessarily demand a further increase the capabilities of the U.S.
missile defense system in response. While larger Russian and Chinese
arsenals may place greater deterrence requirements on U.S. nuclear
forces above the level of coercive attacks on the homeland, the original
purpose of the expanded and improved U.S. homeland missile defense
system would still stand and be of value. If adversary strategic nuclear
arsenals grow in response to expanded U.S. homeland missile defenses,
far from a certainty, that would only increase the importance of raising
the threshold for nuclear war by deterrence threats of punishment and
defense-based deterrence threats of denial.

[The notion that expanded U.S. [missile defenses]{.mark} will likely
cause an [arms race is]{.mark} further [discredited when one considers
how un-race-like]{.mark} the [U.S. defense acquisition]{.mark} process
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with major defense program timelines from
design to deployment often [[measured]{.mark} not in single years, but
[in decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. An expanded and improved U.S.
[homeland [missile defense]{.mark} system [will not happen
overnight]{.mark} and [given]{.mark} the [open nature of]{.mark} U.S.
political [debate and shifting]{.mark} political [power between
two]{.mark} major [parties, adversaries will]{.mark} likely be able to
[follow]{.mark} U.S. missile defense [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}
in near real time as timeline and capability projections shift. In
short, [[this]{.mark} arms dynamic is hardly worthy of the name "race,"
which [should temper concerns about]{.mark} arms race or [crisis
instability]{.mark} -- there [is no need for]{.mark} other [states to
act rashly]{.mark}]{.underline} when the system in question may be more
than a decade, or more, away from a reality.

In conclusion, before submitting to the seemingly appealing logic of
"action-reaction" dynamics at play with U.S. missile defenses, U.S.
policymakers should consider the range of options available to
adversaries beyond "racing," the historical record that contradicts arms
racing theory, and the inherently complicated and multi-factored defense
acquisition process that plays out differently in each country according
to their unique characteristics. In short, arms racing in response to an
expanding U.S. homeland missile defense system is neither guaranteed nor
reflective of the value of the system. Additionally, critics of U.S.
homeland missile defense, as Herman Kahn pointed out over 50 years ago,
"...really cannot have it both ways. They point out, presumably
correctly, that on paper it is easy to counter and largely nullify the
\[thin missile defense\] system (subject of course, to the uncertainties
I have already discussed). They then argue that the Soviets will be so
concerned... that they will react in a serious and dramatic way,
accelerating the arms race."89 [Whether or not Russia, China, North
Korea, or some other power will be concerned at the prospect of an
improved and expanded U.S. homeland missile defense system, the United
States cannot allow an adversary's potential concerns to have veto power
over whether it should pursue a system that, in its net effect, will
contribute greatly to its national interests around the
world.]{.underline}

Why Russia Really Opposes U. S. Missile Defense

According to official statements, [[Russia opposes]{.mark} U.S. [missile
defenses]{.mark} because they could someday provide the United States a
strategic advantage during a nuclear exchange. [While elements]{.mark}
of Russia's position [are]{.mark} no doubt [genuine]{.mark}]{.underline}
and rooted in its confidence in America's technological prowess, [[there
are]{.mark} likely other, [more compelling reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}
for Russia to oppose U.S. missile defense, ones [having more to do [with
geopolitics than]{.mark} nuclear [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
short, [[Moscow]{.mark} appreciates that it [can use this]{.mark} issue
[as leverage]{.mark} with the United States]{.underline} while creating
tension among its allies.

Obama understood this. In commenting about Russia's opposition to the
deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe, he observes in his
recent book that Putin "correctly understood that the main reason Poland
and the Czech Republic were eager to host our system was that it would
guarantee increased U.S. military capabilities on their soil, providing
an additional hedge against Russian intimidation." [[Russia's opposition
to]{.mark} U.S. missile [defense in Europe]{.mark} was [not because it
feared]{.mark} that [10]{.mark} ground-based [interceptors]{.mark} could
[jeopardize]{.mark} Russia's nuclear [retaliatory capability,
but]{.mark} rather such cooperation [was an affront to]{.mark} Russia's
former [influence in]{.mark} Eastern [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Russia also viewed this as an opportunity to sow dissension among the
allies.

The [[modernization]{.mark} and expansion]{.underline} of Russian
nuclear forces [has [not been driven by]{.mark} U.S. [missile
defense]{.mark} deployments. [Since]{.mark} pulling out of the
[A]{.mark}nti-[B]{.mark}allistic [M]{.mark}issile]{.underline} Treaty,
[the [U.S. has deployed]{.mark} a modest 44 ground-based
interceptors]{.underline} (40 in Alaska and four in California) for the
protection of the nation against North Korean intercontinental ballistic
missiles. [That number is projected to rise to [64]{.mark}]{.underline}
should the Biden administration follow through with plans initiated by
the Trump administration.  [[Russian leaders surely realize Russia
deploys more homeland]{.mark} defense [interceptors]{.mark} than the
United States, [and]{.mark} that their [S-400]{.mark} and S-500 air
defense systems [are comparable to U.S.]{.mark} theater missile defense
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, [[Putin]{.mark}
himself]{.underline} has [[noted]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[by
2021]{.underline}]{.mark}, 90 percent of [Russia's [nuclear forces will
be]{.mark}]{.underline} modernized and, in his words, "[capable of
confidently [overcoming]{.mark} existing and [even projected missile
defense]{.mark} systems]{.underline}."

#### Russia is lying about modernization being in reaction to the US\-\--they boast about being able to defeat [future systems]{.underline}.

https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IS-505.pdf)

Russian Confidence in Defeating U.S. Missile Defenses

Another indicator that [[Russian officials are]{.mark} selectively
[exaggerating]{.mark} their apparent [concerns over]{.mark} U.S.
[missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline} is the [[plethora of]{.mark}
confident [official]{.mark} Russian [assessments]{.mark} that [they can
defeat any]{.mark} existing or [future]{.mark} missile defense
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Proponents of limiting U.S. missile
defense have completely failed to account for why Russian officials
continuously state that they can overcome U.S. missile defenses -- a
position that would appear to contradict Russian rhetoric about their
worry that their nuclear forces could be negated. If proponents of
limiting U.S. missile defenses are correct in their assertion that the
United States should take Russian rhetoric at face value, the official
Russian statements below should be rare or non-existent. However, these
kinds of confident assessments are anything but rare in official Russian
public discourse -- indicating once again that [Russian officials tailor
their messages to their audience]{.underline}. In public comments
directed to the United States and others internationally, [Russian
officials generally stress their apparent concerns about U.S. missile
defenses as a way to gain diplomatic and military leverage]{.underline}.
In public comments directed toward a domestic Russian audience,
officials tend to emphasize the futility of U.S. missile defense in the
face of Russian technology.

Nor is this a recent phenomenon as Russian officials including President
Putin have claimed for nearly 20 years that they can defeat current and
future U.S. missile defenses. [[Such confident]{.mark} Russian
[assertions contradict]{.mark} their repeated [claims]{.mark} that [they
are worried about]{.mark} future U.S. [missile defense]{.mark} advances
that [could negate their]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}. Again,
[this]{.mark} apparent contradiction only [strengthens the case]{.mark}
for believing [that]{.mark} Russian [officials tailor their
message]{.mark} to the primary audience to whom they are speaking --
[hyping]{.mark} their perception of [danger]{.mark} or downplaying risks
as needed [to advance their]{.mark} national [interests]{.mark}
diplomatically and [militarily. The quotes below

To reiterate, the apparently contradictory statements by Russian
officials on both their fear of U.S. missile defenses and their
confidence in defeating current and future U.S. missile defenses is best
explained by a policy of tailoring their speeches to their primary
audience for maximum diplomatic and, ultimately, military effect. [[The
sheer number of]{.mark} official Russian
[statements]{.mark}]{.underline} expressing their confidence in
defeating current and future U.S. missile defenses -- statements made by
some of the senior-most officials including President Putin over a 20
year period -- [[underscores how misleading it is for proponents
of]{.mark} U.S. missile [defense limitations]{.mark} only [to cite
Russian statements]{.mark} expressing their supposed fears.]{.underline}

[[Critics]{.mark} will likely [respond]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
that [[even if U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} leaders [are [unlikely
to]{.mark}]{.underline} be tempted by the option of a [[first strike,
adversaries]{.mark} will [still believe]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is preparing]{.mark}]{.underline} for a first strike --
[[thus increasing]{.mark} their [incentive]{.mark} to strike first
before they are]{.underline} potentially [disarmed. [A]{.mark} major
[unstated assumption]{.mark}]{.underline} in this criticism, of course,
[[is]{.mark} that [adversaries will]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed
[[believe they are vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark} to a U.S. first
strike and their threatened response will be ineffective for deterrence.
[[Given]{.mark} the [authoritarian]{.mark} nature of]{.underline} the
[[regimes]{.underline} in [Moscow and Beijing, there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least, [[strong incentives for]{.mark}
civilian and military [officials to tell]{.mark} their]{.underline}
respective [[rulers]{.underline}]{.mark} that [their [state is not
vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} to a U.S. first strike -- lest the
dictator wonder why they have failed to secure the state against a first
strike. Indeed, one pertinent historical example illustrates the
competing incentives that adversary leaderships will face should the
United States seriously pursue an expanded U.S. homeland missile defense
system. Then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov responded to U.S. President
Reagan's announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative by stating
that the United States, in pursuing its missile defenses, was actually
pursuing a first strike capability against the Soviet Union; but
simultaneously stated that "All attempts at achieving military
superiority over the Soviet Union are futile. The Soviet Union will
never allow them to succeed. It will never be caught defenseless by any
threat."65

[This]{.underline} commentary, in fact, highlights what [is likely to be
the]{.underline} standard [reaction by Russia, China, and North Korea to
the prospect of]{.underline} significantly improved [U.S. homeland
missile defenses. Their leaders will likely employ
apocalyptic]{.underline}-sounding [language]{.underline}, meant to shock
and dismay U.S. and allied audiences and erode support for these kinds
of defenses. There are significant indications that this is Russia's
current strategy against the far more limited U.S. homeland missile
defense system today.66 When Russia's and China's coercive strategies
for achieving their revisionist aims depend upon missile-based threats
against the U.S. homeland, it should be no surprise that they will
protest loudly against any threat to their strategy and goals. Critics,
at this point, will interject that Russian, Chinese, and North Korean
leaders will still have reason to fear these developments even if they
do not overtly pursue their revisionist aims -- the United States could
still attempt a first strike to eliminate a potential threat. In that
case, under this assumption, adversary leaderships have strong
incentives to strike first before they are potentially disarmed by the
United States.

[The obvious flaw]{.underline} in the logic of this criticism [is that
[adversary leaderships]{.mark} have very strong incentives not to
attempt a [first strike against]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} -- because [doing so [would turn]{.mark}
the [possibility of]{.mark} suffering [existential damage into]{.mark}
the near [certainty]{.mark} of existential damage]{.underline}. The
presence of [[U.S.]{.mark} active [defenses]{.mark} does [not
degrade]{.mark} the [deterrent]{.mark} effect [of]{.mark} U.S.
[retaliatory capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, when faced with
the possibility of a United States with very credible damage limitation
capabilities, [[an adversary]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly
[[could]{.mark} decide to [strike]{.mark} the United States]{.underline}
with everything that it possessed, [[but what would this
accomplish?]{.mark} U.S. [forces]{.mark} capable of [delivering
a]{.mark} devastating [response]{.mark} could [make]{.mark} the
adversary's [first strike the worst]{.mark} possible
[outcome]{.mark}]{.underline} for the adversary. [It would]{.underline},
as Otto von Bismarck famously quipped, [be a case of
committing]{.underline} national [suicide for fear of
death]{.underline}. Historically, [the [Soviet Union
continued]{.mark}]{.underline} to function [[under]{.mark} a
[U.S.]{.mark} nuclear [monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline} from 1945-1949, and
clear U.S. strategic first strike advantages [[from 1950 to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} early [19[60]{.mark}s]{.underline}, even during times
of crisis. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, likewise, [[has]{.mark}
continued]{.underline} to function [while at a clear disadvantage
relative to the United States]{.underline} for its entire existence as a
nuclear power, since 1964. In short, Russia, China, and [[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [have decades]{.mark} of historical experience [living
under]{.mark} the [theoretical]{.mark} possibility of a U.S. [first
strike]{.mark}]{.underline} [[without seeing]{.mark} a first strike of
[their own as a]{.mark} strategic [necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S.
defenses to deter and defeat coercive threats would not fundamentally
change that circumstance for them.

How useful such a weapon would be is debatable. [[Poseidon is too
slow]{.mark}, [compared to ICBMs and bombers]{.mark}, to be useful in a
first strike or an immediate retaliatory strike]{.underline}. Moving at
high speeds may make it so noisy that anti-submarine can detect it, and
its autonomous nature brings up all the questions about armed robots
(especially ones carrying mega-bombs). Nonetheless, as a psychological
weapon, it\'s brilliant. There is something frightening, like a
Hollywood monster movie, about the thought of a robot tsunami-bomb
creeping along the sea floor. But for every vampire, there is a stake
waiting to slay it through the heart. H I Sutton, a naval analyst who
runs the Covert Shores blog on naval affairs, offers some ideas on
technology that NATO can employ to halt Poseidon. Sutton assumes that
Poseidon\'s \"operating modes and route planning will likely be simple
(read reliable) and relatively direct, relying on speed and depth for
survival.\" That being the case, [one
[countermeasure]{.mark}]{.underline} would be to [[seed]{.mark} the
[seabed with]{.mark} networks of sensor-[mines to detect and destroy
Poseidons]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"Ideally the sensor networks would
include their own effectors (e.g. torpedo armed mines) to minimize the
delay from detection to neutralization, since the targets will be moving
much faster than traditional submarine targets,\" Sutton writes. Sutton
also wonders whether [[Poseidons]{.mark} could be [killed by long-range
hypersonic]{.mark} glide vehicles launched by]{.underline} U.S. [Navy
submarines]{.underline}. \"The payload could be next-generation
lightweight torpedo or nuclear depth charge similar to the retired
Subroc \[rocket-launched anti-submarine torpedo\] weapon,\" he writes.
\"[The [short flight time]{.mark} and long range of this type of system
would [allow kills far outside realistic ranges]{.mark} for torpedoes
and allow submarines operating in the North Atlantic to react to
Poseidon launches detected in the Arctic region]{.underline}, hitting
the target while it is still reasonably near to the sensor which
detected it.\"

Additionally, the U.S. intelligence assessment reportedly notes that the

that sea trials of the new weapon system, including tests of the

stressed over the last months that the ongoing tests are not
full-fledged sea trials and focus on the Poseidon's guidance system and
underwater operations in autonomous mode. The drone is listed in
Russia's state armament program for 2018-2027 and is expected to be
delivered to the Russian military in the late 2020s. The Russian Navy is
expected to receive up to 30 Poseidon UUVs. [[It is]{.mark} still

Title: [Russia\'s [Nukes in Space]{.mark}]{.underline}? Why You
[[Shouldn\'t Panic]{.mark} About this]{.underline} New
[Threat]{.underline}

While this certainly suggests a serious concern for Defense officials
and lawmakers alike, [official [reports]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[suggest]{.mark} that the]{.underline} national security
[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} in question [[is not
imminent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, the developing information
concerns emerging Russian military capabilities in space that the
American Defense apparatus will need to address in the long term. 

"I want to assure the American people [there is no need for public
alarm]{.underline}," House Speaker Mike [Johnson said]{.underline} at
the Capitol. "We are going to work together to address this matter, as
we do all sensitive matters that are classified and beyond that, I'm not
at liberty to disclose classified information and really can't say much
more, but we just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel,
we're working on it, and there's no need for alarm."

To that end, White House officials have similarly stated that while the
threat appears serious, [[there are ways to]{.mark} "[contain]{.mark}"
it [without]{.mark} triggering mass [panic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of
course, despite these reassurances, social media platforms like TikTok
were soon flooded with hyperbolic discussion, with some claiming that
"the more they say not to panic, the more I'm going to panic."

While more details about this threat are sure to be released in the
coming days, [the [nature of]{.mark} a [space]{.mark}-based
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [does not suggest]{.mark} a [greater need for
concern]{.mark} over Russia's]{.underline} existing nuclear
[arsenal]{.underline}, which includes large-yield intercontinental
nuclear missiles in sufficient volume to overwhelm American missile
defenses. [[This is not]{.mark} a [new development, but rather]{.mark}

Congressman Mike [[Turner]{.mark} seemed to [get ahead of both]{.mark}
the [process and]{.mark} the [intel]{.mark}ligence [itself, and
created]{.mark} a bit of a [panic]{.mark}]{.underline} by demanding full
and immediate declassification of all information about the system. [[It
now seems]{.mark} this was [alarmist, and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps
[[motivated by]{.mark} other [political factors]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Leaks seemed to indicate that Russia might be planning to launch a
nuclear-powered anti-satellite directed energy weapon into space. U.S.
officials are reportedly telling allies Russia could launch the system
into space within the next year.  Details became a little clearer,
thanks to a public briefing by White House Advisor Adm. John Kirby.
Kirby confirmed that the planned system was still in development, and
President Biden later said it was not clear if and when the system would
be deployed. Importantly, Kirby also stated that [the [system]{.mark},
if deployed, [would violate]{.mark} the [O]{.mark}]{.underline}uter
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}pace [[T]{.underline}]{.mark}reaty of 1967. That
phrase made clear that the Russian program involved placing a nuclear
weapon in outer space, [since deploying nuclear weapons in space is the

https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OP-Vol.-2-No.-9.pdf)

[It Will Be Destabilizing During a Crisis]{.underline} Because of First
Strike Fears

[An oft-voiced [criticism of]{.mark} U.S. homeland [missile defense
is]{.mark}]{.underline} that it could produce two separate dangers,
perhaps simultaneously: first, [the [presence]{.mark} of]{.underline}
very capable U.S. [homeland missile defenses will [cause first strike
incentives among U.S. leaders because they]{.mark} will [believe]{.mark}
the [defenses can negate]{.mark} the uncoordinated and diminished
adversary [response]{.mark}]{.underline} to a U.S. first strike within
acceptable levels of risk and damage. Second, that the adversary will
perceive an increased risk of a massive U.S. first strike because the
United States is modernizing its nuclear arsenal, in addition to its
significant conventional precision-strike capabilities, to the point
where even imperfect defenses could negate the adversary's response --
thus inducing first strike incentives in the adversary's leadership
during a crisis. 58 Together, these suggested possibilities are the
basis for Thomas Schelling's famous concern about the "reciprocal fear
of surprise attack."59

Both [criticisms falter]{.underline} on the fact that such concerns
sound plausible in theory, but in practice, [a whole [host of factors
make]{.mark} them [implausible]{.mark}]{.underline}. To begin with the
criticism that expanded U.S. homeland missile defense could incentivize
U.S. leaders to consider preemption or a first strike, context is key.
As multiple recent Department of Defense publications have made clear,
[U.S. [officials believe]{.mark} the [most likely scenario for]{.mark}
an [adversary's]{.mark} nuclear [employment is a limited]{.mark} nuclear
[strike in]{.mark} the context of [an ongoing]{.mark} conventional
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 [If the United States received
advanced warning or indications that a limited strike was imminent, the
possibility of employing an expanded U.S. homeland missile defense
system would provide a potentially attractive option to U.S. leaders who
wish to avoid the obvious risks inherent in preemptive
strikes]{.underline}. In short, [an expanded [homeland]{.mark} missile
[defense]{.mark} system [would]{.mark} usefully [expand]{.mark} the
[range of options for]{.mark} U.S. [leaders]{.mark} by
[providing]{.mark} a feasible [alternative to]{.mark} preemptive
[strikes]{.mark} -- thus potentially [lowering]{.mark} the [incentives
for preemption]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If critics of homeland missile defense still believe there may be
temptations to preempt among U.S. leaders, then an additional
illustration may be useful. [For a scenario like North Korea, [even
if]{.mark} U.S. [leaders were]{.mark} incredibly [confident]{.mark} that
[their]{.mark} improved homeland missile [defenses]{.mark} could
[intercept]{.mark} even the largest North Korean [nuclear
response]{.mark} that survived a U.S. first strike, that [would not
diminish]{.mark} U.S. and [allied concerns]{.mark} about the amount of
damage North Korea could inflict on South Korea or Japan]{.underline}
during even the most effective U.S. first strike. [[Even if one
biases]{.mark} the assumptions in a strike plan to improve [U.S.
performance]{.mark}]{.underline} and decrease North Korean performance,
[there [is still the]{.mark} significant [chance]{.mark} that North
Korean [strikes]{.mark} could [kill millions]{.mark} of civilians [in
allied]{.mark} urban [centers. It is]{.mark} highly [unlikely]{.mark}
that [U.S.]{.mark}, much less allied, [leaders would be]{.mark}come
[cavalier]{.mark} in such a situation. If, even under this "best case
scenario" for an effective U.S. first strike, U.S. and allied leaders
are still likely to be very apprehensive]{.underline}, then how much
less likely are they to feel emboldened to conduct preemptive attacks
against Russia or China, whose nuclear arsenal sizes and land masses are
orders of magnitude greater than North Korea's?

Additionally, as was recognized even during the Cold War, [if the United
States did try to pursue an effective first strike force posture, the
effort itself would meet all sorts of resistance both politically at
home, and among allies abroad]{.underline}.61 Longtime observers in
Russia and China of American defense issues would likely quickly
recognize the infeasibility of the United States pursuing a first strike
posture, especially [[given]{.mark} the [shifting nature of]{.mark} U.S.
[political power]{.mark}, transparency in [defense spending]{.mark}, and
the long lead times for (what would undoubtedly be) multiple massive and
new defense programs]{.underline}.

The reasons why even very effective [U.S. homeland [missile
defenses]{.mark} are [unlikely to stimulate]{.mark}]{.underline} truly
convincing [first [strike temptations]{.mark}]{.underline} for its
leadership [are operational and political]{.underline}. Colin Gray cites
six operational challenges to a first strike even in the presence of the
attacker's highly effective homeland defenses: [the [possibility
of]{.mark}]{.underline} catastrophic [[failure of]{.mark} the missile
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline} system under the most stressing real world
conditions; [the rate of "leakage" in the missile defense]{.underline}
system and the damage caused; [unexpectedly effective adversary
tactics]{.underline}; local [denial of [conventional
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [possibility of a [prolonged
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} against an adversary with mobilization
capacity; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, finally, [the [possibility
of]{.mark} a "[nuclear winter]{.mark}" that ultimately costs
more]{.underline} than any apparent benefits of a first strike.62 As
Gray notes, [a state's [leadership may dismiss one]{.mark} or more [of
these]{.mark} challenges as unlikely, [but]{.mark} the [combination of
all]{.mark} six as real possibilities [indicates]{.mark} that even a
greatly expanded]{.underline} and effective [U.S. homeland missile
[defense]{.mark} system [is unlikely to make]{.mark}]{.underline} the
option of a [[first strike]{.mark} sound]{.underline} very
[[appealing]{.underline}]{.mark} to U.S. leaders.

There is even the near-term prospect that [whatever possible incentives
U.S. leaders may feel to conduct a preemptive first strike will actually
decrease]{.underline} over the next decade, [even with]{.underline} the
potential addition of [expanded homeland missile defenses. [If
China]{.mark}'s nuclear arsenal grows]{.underline} to a projected 1,000
nuclear warheads by 2030, [[and]{.mark} if [Russia's]{.mark} strategic
nuclear [arsenal]{.mark} also [grows]{.mark}]{.underline} as projected,
U.S. [[leaders]{.mark} will likely [realize]{.mark}]{.underline} that
even in the event of a first strike against Russia or China, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates could find itself [at a]{.mark} major
strategic [disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline} compared to the remaining
nuclear-armed adversary, as it seeks to remedy its depleted (or severely
damaged) nuclear forces and infrastructure.63 Given the nature of a
"first strike," the ultimate "cannot fail" mission that practically
demands redundant and overlapping targeting techniques, the U.S. nuclear
arsenal will likely be far smaller after a first strike than before,
and, given the lengthy lead times for the production of additional
nuclear weapons, the short-term outlook for deterring the remaining
adversarial nuclear power will appear especially bleak. The outlook will
appear even bleaker still considering the potential damage that
adversary missiles impose should they break through or overwhelm U.S.
homeland defenses. Additionally, Russian and Chinese leaders are also
likely to increasingly recognize this fundamental strategic dilemma for
the United States; although the potential consequences of this are
unknown, they are unlikely to be beneficial to the United States.

The second, and perhaps more fundamental reason why improved U.S.
homeland missile defenses are unlikely to stimulate first strike
incentives is political in nature. As the British strategist Laurence
Martin wrote, "[[A power]{.mark} believing itself]{.underline}, on
technical calculations, [to have a fairly clean first-strike capability
[may]{.mark} well [refrain]{.mark}]{.underline} from implementing this
capability [[because of moral considerations]{.underline}]{.mark},

In short, critics of homeland missile defense often assume that the
potential technical capability to conduct a first strike is enough to
raise the risks of such a strike, when in reality, there must not only
be the political will to back a first strike to raise the risks, but
also a political will combined with a high degree of risk-acceptance.

A 1999 RAND report described the situation this way: "Ballistic missile
defense is not simply a shield but an enabler of U.S. action" (Gompert
and Isaacson 1999). Similarly, [[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration officials [[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[with a
missile shield]{.mark}, "A [president]{.mark} will [be free to intervene
in]{.mark} regional [conflicts]{.mark} against heavily armed foes such
as North Korea, Iran, or Iraq [without worrying about losing a]{.mark}n
American [city]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Diamond 2001). [[But]{.mark} to
act as such a shield, the missile [defense]{.mark} system [would need to
demonstrate]{.mark} that [it is highly effective]{.mark}]{.underline},
through thorough, rigorous testing that provides high confidence in this
capability. [[Otherwise it is too risky]{.mark} to rely on]{.underline}.

[Reliably protecting US cities from a nuclear attack]{.underline},
however, [is so difficult and uncertain that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will never]{.mark} realistically be able to [eliminate
nuclear blackmail]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[even if]{.mark}
US [officials]{.mark} knew the GMD system [had]{.mark} an improbably
high [95 percent effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} against one missile,
[an attack by [just five missiles]{.mark} still [has]{.mark} a
[one-in-four chance of]{.mark}]{.underline} at least [one]{.underline}
nuclear [warhead [penetrating]{.mark} the defense]{.underline} and
destroying a city 18---a more likely outcome than correctly predicting
the roll of a die.

\[\[FN 18\]\]

18 A 95 percent reliability would mean each missile would have a 1/20
chance of getting through the shield. [For five missiles, the
probability]{.underline} that one would get through [is 5 x 1/20 = 5/20
or 1/4 (one in four).]{.underline}

\[\[END FN 18\]\]

Using multiple interceptors to target each warhead is a strategy that
only works well when the interceptors are already reliable; using four
interceptors to target each warhead yields the same one-in-four chance
of a warhead getting through if each interceptor were 50 percent
reliable, and if the failure modes were independent. If the failure
modes are not independent, shooting additional interceptors does not
help; for example, [[decoys]{.mark} that fool one interceptor
[would]{.mark} likely [fool them all]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Appendix
8: Confidence Levels and Probability).

And as the discussion in Chapter 4 indicates, [the reality is that the
[limited testing]{.mark} program [means officials will not know]{.mark}
the [reliability]{.mark}]{.underline} of the defense system [with high
confidence]{.underline}, especially against a real-world attack that it
has not faced before. [With unknown capability, the [defense]{.mark}
system [cannot support]{.mark} a [freedom-of-action]{.mark} doctrine. US
officials will simply never have high enough confidence]{.underline} in
the GMD system's capability [to take actions as though US cities were
invulnerable to nuclear attack.]{.underline}

While the GMD system will not meet the goal of defeating an attack, what
about building a GMD system---even one with largely unknown
effectiveness and reliability---to provide whatever defense it can
against a nuclear missile attack on US cities.

[The]{.underline} simplistic [argument that "any defense is better than
no defense" is not credible]{.underline}---the Pentagon has criteria for
deciding when to invest resources in military systems, and missile
defense should be no exception. [The benefits must outweigh the
costs]{.underline}, which are discussed below.

But it is also important to recognize that [the [GMD]{.mark} system [has
not]{.mark} been [developed]{.mark} and built]{.underline} over the last
decade [in the way one would build a system whose goal was [to protect
US cities]{.mark}]{.underline}. If it had been, the emphasis would have
been on producing a system with demonstrated capability rather than
continuing to rush minimally tested hardware into the field. If
developing an effective missile defense is a goal of the GMD system,
then this deeply flawed development process is not the right path.

Improved Deterrent Effects by Denying Russia's and China's Theories of
Victory

As senior U.S. defense officials have testified, Russia and
[[China]{.mark} are increasingly [investing in missiles to
strike]{.mark} the [U.S. homeland, a lynchpin capability for]{.mark}
their [regional ambitions]{.mark} and the foundation for their coercive
strategies against the United States]{.underline}. A U.S. [[homeland
missile defense]{.mark} system]{.underline} that is designed [to [defeat
coercive attacks]{.mark} could greatly [improve deterrence]{.mark} by
[raising the]{.mark}]{.underline} threshold or ["[entry price]{.mark}"
[for attacking]{.mark} the U.S. homeland]{.underline}, while still
holding in reserve the deterrent threat of a devastating U.S. offensive
response. In this sense, the deterrent threat of denial is additive to
the deterrent threat of punishment -- an attack could fail and be too
costly.

A key concept in this regard is "complicating" the adversary's attack
plans -- an oft-used term that is rarely expounded upon. In essence, an
expanded U.S. homeland missile defense system creates unfavorable
operational and political tradeoffs for the adversary. If, for example,
Russia considers conducting a coercive strike against the U.S. homeland
that has an expanded missile defense system, it could launch more
missiles in an attempt to overwhelm the missile defenses, but it risks
potentially signaling that it has unlimited intentions -- that is, U.S.
officials might see the missile attack as so numerous that it might be
the leading edge of a first strike, thus encouraging a potentially
larger U.S. response. If that option is deemed too risky to the Russian
leadership, then perhaps it could add expensive countermeasures to its
missiles -- but this option could increase cost, add weight, decrease
range, increase complexity, and still risk having a significant number
of missiles intercepted. Finally, Russia could adapt its tactics and
perhaps operate its submarines closer to the U.S. coast to decrease
warning time and intercept attempts, but such actions again may risk
unintentionally signaling to U.S. leaders an incoming first strike, or
at a minimum, raising the risk of Russian submarines being detected
before they launch their missiles. In short, the presence of an expanded
U.S. homeland missile defense system denies the adversary his preferred
coercive attack plan -- it raises risks, increases costs, and adds
uncertainty. Again, an adversary's leadership may require a high
confidence assessment that its proposed coercive attack on the United
States will work as planned, so the uncertainties, risks, and tradeoffs
listed above may prove decisive for deterrence.

[An expanded U.S. homeland [missile defense]{.mark} system could
[strengthen deterrence]{.mark} against coercive missile attacks [by
lowering]{.mark} the perceived [value of making]{.mark} such [threats
against]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in the first
place]{.underline}. Russia and [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, among
others, [[may believe]{.mark} that issuing [ultimatums]{.mark}, implicit
[threats, or]{.mark} explicit threats of [coercive attacks]{.mark}
against the U.S. homeland [can limit]{.mark} the [U.S. leadership's
freedom of action during a]{.mark} crisis or [conflict, raising the
prospect]{.mark} and perceived likelihood [of "winning" without
much]{.mark} or any [fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [adversary
[leaderships]{.mark} may [pause before issuing]{.mark} such [threats
if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had]{.mark} the
[capability to defeat coercive attacks]{.mark} against its
homeland]{.underline} since following through on the threats and failing
might reduce the value of future threats and demands against the United
States. Such an attack would demonstrate weakness, not strength, and
would do so at great risk.

#### The CP allows China to employ [coercive missile threats]{.underline} against the homeland, deterring [US conventional intervention]{.underline} in Taiwan\-\--causes a [successful fait accompli]{.underline}.

\[Language ed.\]

[[With]{.mark} respect to a [Taiwan]{.mark} scenario, for
[deterrence]{.mark} purposes [the CCP]{.mark}]{.underline} leadership
[[must recognize]{.mark} that the [U.S.]{.mark} force [posture includes
credible response]{.mark} options [to a]{.mark} massive
[invasion]{.mark} force]{.underline} or China's prospective nuclear
escalation threats. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, again, [the [credibility
of]{.mark} U.S. [response]{.mark} options [will be shaped by the]{.mark}
risk of "[harm]{.mark}"]{.underline} (to use Kahn's term) [[to]{.mark}
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in issuing]{.mark} or executing its
deterrence [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the absence of U.S. and
allied capabilities to limit damage from an opponent's decision to
engage in nuclear escalation, the credibility of the U.S. deterrence
position will be problematic, and especially so with regard to the
Taiwan Question given the comparatively limited U.S. stakes involved.

In short, if the potential risks to the United States inherent in its
deterrence position manifestly outweigh the values at stake, the
credibility of the U.S. deterrence strategy will suffer. Consequently, a
victory denial deterrence strategy in this case demands a U.S.
capability to defend against China's prospective limited nuclear
escalation threats, regional and strategic.

This victory denial deterrence strategy does not presume U.S.
capabilities for a decisive, local military victory or the U.S.
escalation dominance that would enable fully credible U.S. deterrence
threats---backed by highly-effective defenses against all prospective
forms of China's strategic nuclear escalation. If the United States and
allies are able to stalemate China at the local conventional level of
conflict, the U.S. deterrent position does not require a credible U.S.
nuclear escalation threat. However, [a [victory denial]{.mark}
deterrence strategy does [demand U.S.]{.mark} and allied]{.underline}
expressions and [[capabilities that deny CCP]{.mark} leaders
[confidence]{.mark} that [China has]{.mark} the [capabilities for a fait
accompli]{.mark} and escalation dominance, [and]{.mark} can [thereby
realize]{.mark} its theory of [victory via]{.mark} local [conventional
operations]{.mark}]{.underline} and coercive first-use nuclear threats.
[[CCP doubts about]{.mark} China's [ability to succeed
via]{.mark}]{.underline} the combination of regional military operations
and [[coercive]{.mark} nuclear escalation
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}---and fears of the costs that would attend
the lack of success---[[are the fundamental instruments for]{.mark} a
[U.S. victory]{.mark}]{.underline} denial deterrence strategy.

Because [the credibility of any U.S. deterrence strategy requires that
the risks involved not be manifestly out of balance with the
stakes]{.underline} in contention, as is suggested above, [[a
condition]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must
create]{.mark} to make]{.underline} a victory denial
[deterrence]{.underline} strategy most likely to [succeed [is]{.mark} a
system of [damage limitation that does not depend on U.S. nuclear
escalation---i.e.]{.mark}, active [homeland
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the current state of technology, a
homeland missile defense system that is capable of denying any and all
missile strikes by China may not be technically or financially feasible.
Nevertheless, a U.S. homeland missile defense system that is capable of
defeating limited strategic and theater coercive nuclear threats and
strikes may be feasible and sufficient for the victory denial deterrence
purposes discussed here, given additional investments. In the past,
missile defense advocates, including Herman Kahn and Colin Gray,
emphasized the value of U.S. missile defense for the credibility it
could provide for U.S. nuclear escalation deterrence threats. 20 In this
case, however, the value is in helping to deny China any expectation
that it can wield credible nuclear first-use escalation threats.

[The U.S. ability [to defeat a]{.mark} limited [strike on]{.mark} the
U.S. [homeland]{.mark} by China [would]{.mark} help to
[eliminate]{.mark} the [CCP's capacity to threaten]{.mark} the U.S.
homeland with [coercive]{.mark} limited strategic nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---doing so may be essential to the
credibility of a deterrence strategy that denies the CCP the
anticipation of escalation dominance. [[In the absence]{.mark} of the
capability]{.underline} to so defeat limited strikes, [U.S.
[deterrence]{.mark} threats [are]{.mark} likely to be [incredible
if]{.mark} the [CCP calculates]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will be]{.mark} \[[gridlocked]{.mark}\]]{.underline}
~~paralyzed~~ [[by China's]{.mark} limited first-use nuclear
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline} or employment for fear of continued
escalation---recall that the Taiwan Question now becomes an existential
threat to the United States only in the context of such an escalating
conflict.

[A [U.S. defensive system]{.mark}]{.underline} in this case
[[would]{.mark} be intended to limit the damage to the United States
that China could threaten to inflict via limited nuclear first use
strikes, and]{.underline} thereby [[minimize]{.mark} the [coercive
value]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark} leadership [may otherwise attribute to
limited]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear escalation
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}---threats and possible strikes [[designed
to signal]{.mark} the [ability to inflict]{.mark} more [damage
if]{.mark} the [CCP's demands of]{.mark} U.S. [surrender are
unmet]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a [[homeland]{.mark} missile
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline} capability designed [to [deny
China's]{.mark} limited coercive [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} and
attacks could [provide the needed credibility of U.S.
deterrence]{.underline} threats in some scenarios by demonstrating the
United States could limit damage to itself, thereby helping to control
the risks to the United States, while continuing to threaten China with
intolerable "harm." The value of such a system, in addition to the
greater safety for the U.S. population from limited or accidental
missile strikes in general, would be in its potential to help deny China
confidence in its potential coercive nuclear threats and associated
theory of victory.

[[Nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} Counterforce [Capabilities for
[Deterrence:]{.mark} Necessary but [not Sufficient]{.mark}]{.underline}

Given this context, U.S. policymakers face the question: [Are the
supplemental capabilities]{.underline} identified [in the 2018
NPR]{.underline}, the policy of [tailoring deterrence, and the ongoing
modernization of the nuclear triad sufficient in the face of more
complex]{.underline} and more capable [threats against the U.S.
homeland?]{.underline} Or, bluntly stated, [is deterrence
by]{.underline} threats of a [U.S. conventional or nuclear
response]{.underline}, in the face of severe adversary counterthreats,
[sufficient to defend U.S. vital national interests]{.underline} around
the world, both before and after an adversary's strike on the U.S.
homeland?

The supplemental capabilities identified in the 2018 NPR certainly
appear to be logical and potentially helpful responses to adversaries'
coercive nuclear strategies -- but the question remains, is relying on
punitive deterrence threats without defenses sufficient? What can be
done, since adversaries are highly motivated and so clearly investing
heavily in missiles that can strike the U.S. homeland as if they had
already accounted for the predicted U.S. reaction to such a strike? In
other words, what role might the U.S. ability to limit damage to itself
play in deterring the worst-case scenario: missile strikes against the
U.S. homeland?

The Report on the Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States --
2020 states that, "Should deterrence fail, the United States will strive
to end any conflict at the lowest level of damage possible and on the
best achievable terms for the United States, allies, and partners. U.S.
nuclear weapons employment guidance directs minimizing civilian damage
to the extent possible consistent with achieving U.S. objectives and
restoring deterrence."23 Current U.S. damage limitation capabilities at
the strategic level are largely limited to the potential for offensive
strikes employing nuclear weapons -- the ability to inflict destruction
on an adversary's forces to prevent further destruction to the United
States. The current Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) missile defense
system was designed to defeat a rogue state threat, not one from Russia
or China.

The concept of deterring conflict, or limiting escalation if conflict
occurs -- and thus limiting damage to the United States -- through the
capability for limited strikes against the adversary has a long line of
bipartisan support among U.S. defense officials. However, multiple U.S.
Secretaries of Defense have stated that [[there are no
guarantees]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark} attempts to limit damage to itself
and restore [deterrence through]{.mark} limited [nuclear strikes]{.mark}
on the adversary [will work]{.mark}, and [some]{.mark} have [even
expressed outright skepticism]{.mark}]{.underline} at the prospect.24
Indeed, [nobody can knowingly predict how the process might
end]{.underline}, whether through conciliation, arbitration, or general
nuclear war. [[In]{.mark} the [absence of homeland defenses]{.mark},
damage limitation at the strategic level ultimately rests on mutual
targeting restraint]{.underline}, a tacit agreement between adversaries
in the midst of a conflict. Mutual targeting restraint during nuclear
war is possible, yet senior [U.S. officials are loathe to express
confidence]{.underline} -- much less certainty -- [that will be the
outcome]{.underline}.25

It is at this point that the U.S. reliance on offensive conventional and
nuclear threats to deter strikes on the homeland becomes open to
question. [[If an adversary struck the]{.mark} U.S.
[homeland]{.mark}]{.underline} with a measured number of nuclear weapons
[[for]{.mark} the purposes of [coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates would design its
[response]{.mark} to [be devastating]{.mark}]{.underline} and outweigh
any benefit the adversary may have expected -- [[but that is cold
comfort]{.mark} to the victims of the initial attack]{.underline} or to
any further attacks by opponents. [The promise to avenge is indeed
powerful, but [it cannot stop an attack]{.mark} as it occurs, [and it
certainly cannot guarantee]{.mark} that a [conflict will end
with]{.mark} the [U.S. response]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, the
reason deterrence failed originally may be the same reason it is
unlikely to be reestablished through a limited U.S. response. [[If
confirmation bias and groupthink are]{.mark} strongly [rooted in]{.mark}
an [adversary's]{.mark} leadership's [decision-making]{.mark} dynamic,
then [the likelihood]{.mark} that [U.S. nuclear responses -- no matter
how significant]{.mark} or well-targeted -- [will]{.mark} successfully
[re-establish deterrence at acceptable costs to]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may be distressingly
low]{.mark}]{.underline}.26

The rapid military [modernization of China is transforming the
global]{.underline} military [landscape. The significant expansion of
its strategic nuclear force is one aspect]{.underline} of this strategic
transformation. [For decades, China was expected to develop nothing more
than an "assured retaliation capability,"]{.underline} which would
enable a retaliatory strike against the United States with high
confidence, even after a U.S. first strike.1 [This would be a kind of
enhanced minimum deterrent]{.underline} and would be reflected in the
capability to conduct limited counter-city strikes. [But [China]{.mark}
has [expanded its]{.mark} strategic [nuclear forces to exceed]{.mark}
the [requirements of]{.mark} even an enhanced [minimum
deterrence]{.mark} capability. [Satellite images]{.mark} clearly
[show]{.mark} that [China is building several hundred]{.mark} additional
[ICBM silos. If each]{.mark} new silo [is loaded]{.mark} with the DF-41
ICBM, which]{.underline} reportedly [can carry up to 10 warheads, [China
will have a]{.mark} significant [counterforce capability against
U.S.]{.mark} strategic [nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.2

### AT: Rationality\-\--1AR

#### [RATIONALITY]{.underline}: is [not contradictory]{.underline} with our case. China knows [its stakes are higher]{.underline} in Taiwan, so the prospect of [retaliation isn't sufficient]{.underline}.

**Peters 23**, Ph.D., Senior Fellow at the National Institute for
Deterrence Studies (Robert Peters, 2023, "Rethinking Assumptions About
China," Real Clear Defense,
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2023/03/02/rethinking_assumptions_about_china_884763.html)

Defense policymakers should accept that [the [current]{.mark} Chinese
[nuclear expansion may be]{.mark} part of [a]{.mark} nuclear [coercion
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}, designed [to cast a credible nuclear
shadow over any conflict]{.underline} in which China participates. [Such
an expansion would complicate American decision-making should a crisis
or conflict erupt.]{.underline}

It is possible that [[during]{.mark} the acute [stresses of a]{.mark}
military [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and during the fog of war,
[[Chinese leaders]{.mark} may [believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not respond to nuclear use]{.mark}
in a meaningful way---[particularly if]{.mark} said nuclear employment
is [against a military]{.mark} target. [Such]{.mark} an assumption [may
or may not be true, but Chinese leadership will perceive]{.mark} their
[decision as]{.mark} a [rational]{.mark} choice to employ nuclear
weapons]{.underline} against a superior nuclear armed adversary. In
particular, [they are likely to believe that [if used]{.mark} against a
military target [with]{.mark} little to [no civilian effect]{.mark},
there [is less]{.mark} of a [chance of a retaliatory]{.mark} nuclear
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. If [[China no longer maintains]{.mark} a
"[no first use]{.mark}"]{.underline} policy, [it is fair to question
whether Beijing fears]{.underline} that [a conventional
conflict]{.underline} with the United States [will escalate to nuclear
use]{.underline} and whether they believe China loses such a conflict. 

[[Given]{.mark} Chinese [statements]{.mark}, its [expansion of]{.mark}
its [strategic]{.mark}]{.underline} and conventional [[capabilities,
and]{.mark} its [incursions into Taiwanese air]{.mark} space, it is
prudent to consider]{.underline} updating our assumptions about the
Chinese decision calculus when it comes to a potential conflict with an
American led coalition. Indeed, we should consider the possibility [that
[China views nuclear employment as]{.mark} a
[rational]{.mark}]{.underline} (though not to say certain or likely)
[course of action [in a]{.mark} high stakes [conflict with]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Therefore, the American
defense community cannot continue to assume that China will not use
nuclear weapons, even if such an employment carries significant risk of
escalation. 

Indeed, [[Chinese leadership]{.mark} may [accept]{.mark} those [risks
given]{.mark} the [pressures]{.mark} they face [to win]{.mark} a
conflict with the United States]{.underline}. If old assumptions about
the Chinese arsenal is inferior to the United States' and that China
maintains a no first use policy are no longer valid, what are some
alternate assumptions we should consider? Any of the following are
plausible:

1\. Chinese believes that Washington fears war with China more than
Beijing fears war with the United States.

2\. China does not seek a confrontation with the United States, but it
may not fear a conflict.

3\. [[Beijing believes]{.mark} that [any]{.mark} American-led [coalition
to defend Taiwan will be brittle]{.mark} and easily
fragmented]{.underline} by exploiting the fears of a broader conflict
across the Western Pacific.

4\. [China [believes]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates']{.underline} civil society [[is not willing to
fight]{.mark} a major war [over Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} and will
exert political pressure on the president to limit support to Taiwan.

Testing these assumptions, short of actual conflict, is not possible.
However, it is possible to posit a plausible scenario to understand how
a war may break out and how each side may behave in a conflict. 
[[Imagine]{.mark} a scenario where the [P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy]{.underline} (PLA) [[begins]{.mark}
initial efforts at an [invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan]{.underline} during
which time the United States and other free nations provide large
amounts of lethal aid to Taiwan. [Once a full-scale invasion begins,
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, Japan, and Australia
[publicly declare they [will oppose]{.mark} the invasion [with military
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

[[In this]{.mark} scenario, [the PRC miscalculates American]{.mark} and
coalition will and [strength]{.mark}]{.underline}. The PLA's initial
attempt to land significant amount of ground forces on Taiwan fails. 
[[In China]{.mark}, internal [pressures to]{.mark} win and
[terminate]{.mark} the [conflict quickly, whatever the costs,
mount]{.mark}]{.underline}.  In such an eventuality, [[China
believes]{.mark} that employing [a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [is]{.mark}
the [best]{.mark} way]{.underline} to snatch victory for the jaws of
defeat---by demonstrating capability and, more importantly, will.

[[China]{.mark} likely [believes]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is hesitant to engage in]{.mark} a [limited]{.mark}
nuclear [exchange far from home, where]{.mark} the [stakes are
asymmetrical]{.mark} and more important to the PRC]{.underline}.
Further, [[Beijing]{.mark} likely [believes]{.mark} Washington's [fear
of]{.mark} a limited nuclear [war escalating]{.mark} into a general
nuclear exchange [will deter]{.mark} the [President]{.mark} from
continuing the fight [after first nuclear employment. Given China's
superiority in theater]{.mark} range [nuclear systems, this is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} reasonable, if not necessarily [[correct]{.mark},
assumption]{.underline}.

The context of a nuclear employment will matter. [[Because]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does not extend its]{.mark} nuclear
[umbrella over Taiwan, China]{.mark} likely [believes]{.mark} that [it
can employ]{.mark} a nuclear weapon on Taiwanese soil [without]{.mark} a
high risk of [American]{.mark} nuclear [response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Further, [Chinese leadership likely doubts that the United States will
attack targets on mainland China with nuclear weapons. Beijing
believes]{.underline} that [the Chinese mainland is a sanctuary and that
the United States will not dare strike it]{.underline} in response to a
Chinese nuclear strike on a target in the Pacific---[for fear of
triggering reciprocal strikes by the Chinese]{.underline} on the
American mainland. 

[[If China uses]{.mark} a nuclear weapon]{.underline} against a Japanese
ship engaged in combat operations, for example, [[there is]{.mark}
certain to be [a vigorous debate within]{.mark} the [America]{.mark}n
political system [whether to respond]{.mark} in kind]{.underline}. Some
will argue that the United States should respond with non-nuclear
capabilities while others argue a nuclear response is required to deter
follow on nuclear strikes. At the same time, [American political leaders
will discuss the nuclear endgame. If the United States responds with a
nuclear weapon, how does a war remain limited and how does it end? The
[intensity and length of]{.mark} such a debate is likely to be
significant]{.underline} and would therefore impact allied and partner
perceptions. [The [debate itself may give]{.mark} the [PLA]{.mark}
breathing [room to retake]{.mark} the initiative and achieve [its
objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While there are reasons for China to doubt an American nuclear response,
[there are operational and strategic advantages for the PRC to employ
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. It is possible that [Chinese [leadership
believes]{.mark} that a war for [Taiwan is a vital]{.mark} national
[interest]{.mark} that [they cannot lose. Otherwise]{.mark}, the
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty [fears regime
stability]{.mark} is at stake]{.underline}. It is also possible that
they welcome a scenario in which the United States comes to the aid of
an ally, only to be defeated by China---particularly if that defeat is
capped with a nuclear detonation that goes unanswered by Washington.
There is no greater or more visible signal of China's preeminence in the
Pacific.

To be sure, in this scenario, [China accepts risk by using nuclear
weapons to stave off defeat against an American coalition]{.underline}
in the Pacific, but [[Beijing may deem nuclear use less risky than
defeat by]{.mark} the [Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
particularly true if Chinese leaders convince themselves that the risks
of nuclear employment are manageable, unlikely to manifest, or
acceptable given the stakes.

Admittedly, both [the assumptions and scenario posited above
are]{.underline} speculative, but [not far from the reality of current
knowledge about Chinese thinking]{.underline}. With the United States
largely focused on the Ukraine war, it is important to keep an eye on
China and prepare for a war that might come.  And should it come,
long-held assumptions about the efficacy of military power, alliance
cohesiveness, and the efficacy our integrated deterrent posture may be
tested or even shattered.

\[Language ed.\]

Deterrence by denial through [expanded and improved US homeland [missile
defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [could [be]{.mark} an
[important]{.mark} factor [in presenting China's]{.mark}]{.underline},
Russia's, and North Korea's [[attack planners with]{.mark} the prospect
of [the worst of both worlds:]{.mark} their [attack failing]{.mark} in
its objectives [and provoking]{.mark} an [unacceptable US response. US
leaders are more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}, and may be seen by
adversaries as more likely, [[to respond]{.mark} to an attack
[with]{.mark} overwhelming [force when there is the]{.mark} meaningful
[prospect of limiting]{.mark} the risk of escalation and [damage
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, US officials are more likely to
deter an attack in the first place if adversaries perceive too much risk
or too little likelihood of success in escalating a conflict to the US
homeland. [US homeland missile defenses]{.underline}, therefore, [can
act as deterrent threats in and of themselves]{.underline}, but their
true value lies in how they can also add more credibility to the full
range of US deterrence threats, before and during a conflict.

Approaching this topic with reference to the credibility of US threats,
[[US]{.mark} homeland [missile defenses are unique from conventional or
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [in]{.mark} that [the likelihood a president
would employ them]{.mark} during an attack [is]{.mark} about [100
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 [An [adversary has no reason to
doubt]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would]{.mark} try to
[defend itself, whereas]{.mark} an [adversary may]{.mark} successfully
[convince]{.mark} \[[themselves]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~himself~~
[there is some chance the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would not
employ nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s or]{.mark} conduct a large [conventional
campaign for fear of escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. But US [[missile
defenses]{.underline}]{.mark} are not only valuable in deterring or
defending against an initial attack, they also [can [enable]{.mark} a
[wider array of response]{.mark} options to the attack. Having
improved]{.underline} and expanded [US homeland [missile
defenses]{.mark} will]{.underline} likely [[help a president
believe]{.underline}]{.mark}---and be seen by the adversary as
believing---[that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark}
response [options beyond]{.mark} "[surrender or suicide]{.mark}." If an
adversary believes that]{.underline} the United States has, or likely
has, response options that would be advantageous for the United States
to employ, [then the adversary may be less likely to initiate an attack
in the first place.]{.underline}

#### 2. [COST IMPOSITION]{.underline}\-\--even if the US uses conventional and nuclear weapons in a conflict, China will immediately [force capitulation]{.underline} by threatening the [homeland]{.underline}.

Although the United States has made some progress in conventional and
nuclear forces as needed to support a victory denial deterrence
strategy, more must be done. And, the inadequacy of existing homeland
missile defenses against limited coercive nuclear threats by China
remains an obvious shortcoming that undermines the whole. [[Even
if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [makes]{.mark} the
[necessary investments in conventional and nuclear capabilities, an
effectively defenseless]{.mark} U.S. [homeland]{.mark} likely
[encourages]{.mark} the [CCP to anticipate]{.mark} that U.S. [leaders
will concede to]{.mark} its [coercive]{.mark} nuclear [threats]{.mark},
particularly [given the asymmetry in]{.mark} the apparent
[stakes]{.mark} involved. [It invites CCP expectations of escalation
dominance]{.mark}. And, [in the event of a]{.mark} raging [regional
conflict, a]{.mark} well-timed nuclear [escalatory threat]{.mark} by
China [could render all the sacrifices made by]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and partners up to that point
[meaningless if]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} leadership [rationally decides
to submit to a loss "over there" rather than risk greater losses in
the]{.mark} U.S. [homeland]{.mark}--- [with the likely attendant
collapse of]{.mark} U.S. extended [deterrence]{.mark} credibility
[worldwide]{.mark}. In short, a U.S. [homeland missile defense]{.mark}
system capable of denying limited nuclear strikes can [strengthen
deterrence]{.mark} at the level [where]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is at the greatest risk and where China]{.mark} may
believe it [has the greatest leverage]{.mark}, i.e., [via
coercive]{.mark} nuclear [threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 3. [PERCEPTION]{.underline}. Even if they're [right about retaliation]{.underline}, they're [wrong China believes]{.underline} it. The CP results in near-instant US nuclear strikes on China.

[We can imagine [a]{.mark} plausible [scenario]{.mark} in [which lacking
defenses tempts aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}; if, for instance, the
United States does not have the ability to intercept an HGV (and
currently we do not), [[China]{.mark} might [calculate]{.mark} that [it
can attack US assets]{.mark}]{.underline} on Guam with HGVs, thereby
successfully ~~hobbling~~ [\[[neutralizing]{.mark}\] the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' [capability to intervene in a]{.mark} larger regional
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider a Chinese attack on US bombers.
[[China]{.mark} could assess that]{.underline} destroying the deployed
US nuclear bombers [is an effective way to complicate or even eliminate
politically feasible response options for the United States. It [might
rationalize]{.mark} that]{.underline} without proximate, proportional
options that would have a de-escalatory effect, [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [might simply decide]{.mark} that the best option is [to

[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would respond]{.mark} to a conventional
attack]{.underline} against vulnerable strategic targets [[with
conventional]{.mark} weapons]{.underline} against Chinese nonstrategic
targets, and that the targets of those attacks are worth sacrificing.
[[It is]{.mark} still [possible, however]{.mark}, that [the US would
respond]{.mark} to a preemptive strategic attack---even if carried out
by Chinese conventional weapons---[with nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Across Republican and Democratic
administrations, [[the US]{.mark} [has]{.mark}]{.underline}
conspicuously and correctly [[reserved that right]{.underline}]{.mark}
so as not to communicate to adversaries that the United States is more
tolerant of conventional attacks even with strategic consequences, which
could inadvertently incentivize one.23 [[Still, what matters is
what]{.mark} the [adversary believes]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would do, setting up a]{.mark} potential [Chinese
miscalc]{.mark}ulation [that]{.mark} could [result in]{.mark} a
[disastrous conflict. But if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has]{.mark} a credible ability]{.underline} to protect carriers and US

[intercepting]{.mark} increasingly complex [ballistic]{.mark} and cruise
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} and even highly capable HGVs---[and China
believes this, [that]{.mark} perception [would powerfully contribute to
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} and defense if deterrence fails. It is
one thing to be on the receiving end of a US retaliatory strike after
knocking out a crucial target, but [it would be another thing entirely

all.]{.underline}

I wish to challenge the elevation of this particular criterion, not
because economic considerations are invalid -- they are wholly necessary
and worth significant consideration -- but because
["[cost-effective]{.mark} at the margin" [is]{.mark} subjectively
[applied]{.mark} only to missile defense [to the point where critics
have]{.mark} largely [lost sight of]{.mark} the [strategic
context]{.mark}]{.underline}. Namely, [there is nothing unique about
missile defense systems to suggest that the costs to build them in
relation to the costs to defeat them should dominate the question of
their value to U.S. security interests]{.underline}. In short, questions
of cost-effectiveness -- like any other criterion -- should be viewed in
the broader context of the purposes of a missile defense system, and the
value the United States places on its mission.

The following discussion briefly examines the origin of Nitze's "cost
effective" criterion for SDI, its unstated assumptions, its seemingly
unique application to missile defense, its logical deficiencies, and
finally suggests an improved definition of "cost effective" as it
relates to missile defense.

What is "Cost Effective at the Margin?" When Amb. Nitze first proposed
his three criteria for assessing whether a missile defense system should
be pursued under SDI in 1985, the program was in its technological
exploration phase. In other words, these were criteria for theoretical
systems that had not yet been developed. The criteria were meant to, in
Nitze's words, "... serve as guidance to all those in the executive
branch who would be out talking, lecturing, and testifying on the
developments at the Shultz-Gromyko meeting \[on nuclear arms control and
missile defense\]."72 In 1985, Amb. Nitze explained that: "New defensive
systems must also be cost effective at the margin -- that is they must
be cheap enough to add additional defensive capability so that the other
side has no incentive to add additional offensive capability to overcome
the defense. If this criterion is not met, the defensive systems could
encourage a proliferation of countermeasures and additional offensive
weapons to overcome deployed defenses instead of a redirection of effort
from offense to defense."73

A little over a year later in 1986, Amb. Nitze elaborated on his
"cost-effective" criterion for SDI, saying, "... the defensive system
must be able to maintain its effectiveness against the offense at less
cost than it would take to develop offensive countermeasures and
proliferate the ballistic missiles necessary to overcome it," adding
that such criteria "... has valid application to other military systems
as well..."74 In his memoir, Nitze stated that while he believed U.S.
technology was unable to meet the criterion at the time, he defended
supporting the criterion by noting that U.S. technology was capable of
"unexpected breakthroughs" and such a breakthrough could have provided
"negotiating leverage" during nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet
Union.75

As Nitze notes, critics of the criteria at the time believed his
intentions were far from noble and they suspected he hoped to trade away
SDI as a serious program in exchange for Soviet concessions -- making it
appear the United States gained something tangible while giving up
undeveloped technology.76 Indeed, these beliefs appear to have some
merit given that in each of his major speeches on SDI, the central
importance he places on meeting his criteria is both times connected
with the broader prospects for arms control with the Soviet Union.

Whatever the case may be, "cost-effective at the margin" gained an
especially hallowed place among critics in the debate over homeland
missile defense since it appeared unlikely that the cost of a defensive
interceptor would ever drop below the cost of an offensive missile.
Thus, even if a missile defense system was effective and survivable --
two incredibly important criteria in and of themselves -- if the missile
interceptors cost more, or were likely to begin an arms race, then the
whole system was deemed not worth considering on the grounds of cost and
arms race stability.

Unstated Assumptions Behind the "Cost Effective at the Margin"
Criterion. For a broader understanding of why "cost effective at the
margin" is a poor choice for a criterion with essential veto power over
any potential missile defense system, it is useful to state explicitly
the unstated assumptions behind the criterion. First, [the criterion
[assumes]{.mark} that the [adversary knows, and is confident in]{.mark}
its knowledge of, [the "true"]{.mark} cost-[exchange ratio
between]{.mark} its [missiles and]{.mark} countermeasures and U.S.
missile [interceptors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, [[it assumes]{.mark}
that the [adversary will want to spend]{.mark} the [funds]{.mark}
necessary [to provide]{.mark} some level of [confidence]{.mark} in being
able [to defeat U.S.]{.mark} missile [defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Third, and more fundamentally, [[it assumes]{.mark} that the [adversary
indeed can spend]{.mark} more [funds]{.mark} on defeating U.S. missile
defenses, funds [that]{.mark} the adversary [may be]{.mark}lieve are
[better spent on more pressing needs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fourth, and
perhaps most fundamentally, [it assumes that the adversary does not
already believe it can defeat U.S. missile defenses with the appropriate
confidence level]{.underline} -- an assumption that currently
contradicts a host of senior Russian statements about their ability to
defeat U.S. missile defenses.77 These assumptions, both individually and
collectively, range in credibility from doubtful to, at best,
potentially true only in limited scenarios.

A Criterion Unique to Missile Defense. Given Amb. Nitze's comment that
"cost-effective at the margin" applies to other major U.S. defense
programs, an outside observer might be surprised just how untrue that
rings today. While there are certainly debates about the wisdom of
investing great deals of money in weapon systems that are particularly
pricey given their vulnerability to lower-cost counters, no other major
program is judged to be not worth the investment on that reason alone.
For example, the lead ship of the Ford-class of U.S. aircraft carriers,
CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford, cost approximately \$13 billion to procure.78
While there are no official open-source estimates of what a weapon might
cost that could enable Russia or China to sink this aircraft carrier,
one can safely assume the figure is far below \$13 billion. Likewise,
other major defense programs like the F-35 joint strike fighter, Abrams
tanks, and likely even satellites all may theoretically be defeated by
less costly counters -- that is, they are not "cost-effective at the
margin" according to the Nitze criterion.

Yet, the United States still invests massively in these and other
capabilities; the question then is: [why is the "cost-effective at the
margin"]{.underline} criterion [given such priority when]{.underline}
evaluating [missile defenses]{.underline} but not other systems?

There are two likely answers. First, [critics of missile defense hope to
focus debate]{.underline} on the subject on the one area where they can
quantify an expected disadvantage for missile defense -- [as of today,
[it does]{.mark} likely [cost more to]{.mark} successfully
[intercept]{.mark}]{.underline} a missile [[than]{.mark} it does [to
build]{.mark} and deploy [that missile]{.mark}]{.underline}. As is
discussed below, [[however, this]{.mark} observation [does not
end]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}. That logic, if applied to
other defense systems with equal emphasis, would reduce the U.S.
military to something not worthy of the name. Indeed, it is obvious that
focusing primarily on cost-exchange ratios for any defense program is
penny-wise and pound-foolish.

A second reason why missile defense critics insist so emphatically on
prioritizing the "cost-effective at the margin" criterion to missile
defense is that it simplifies (in a manner to their liking) the
"equation" of whether a missile defense system is worth the investment.
It ignores the primary roles for missile defense, i.e., deterring war
and limiting damage should deterrence fail. Missile defense systems may
spend most of their operational life fulfilling one role primarily,
i.e., deterrence, and it is impossible to quantify the value of a
near-infinite series of non-events.79 Instead, it is easier for critics
of missile defense to ignore the deterrent value of the system and focus
on what can, notionally, be quantified: costs of U.S. and adversary
equipment. Analysts, as Thomas Schelling noted, simply cannot afford to
ignore the "incalculables" just because they cannot be quantified: there
is "... a common difficulty in defense planning: budgets need
calculations, and the 'incalculables', however central they are to
strategy, get subordinated to 'hard facts', whether or not hardness
equals relevance or assumptions are facts."80

Towards a New Definition of "Cost Effective" for Missile Defense. The
Nitze criterion of "cost-effective at the margin" was clearly flawed at
birth, inexplicably elevated above other criteria and applied
politically with such force uniquely against missile defenses. How then
can one fairly judge the level of investment that is appropriate for
missile defense? Clearly the "cost" criterion must be a major factor in
U.S. decisions on missile defense -- the question is how does the "cost"
criterion relate to the other criteria?

At the more fundamental level, which defense objectives does the United
States value most? Clearly, the most highly valued objectives are those
which, if failed to be achieved, would be the most consequential for the
United States. Thus, both the 2018 and 2022 summaries of the National
Defense Strategies list "defending the homeland" as the number one
objective or priority.81 Any analysis, therefore, of the appropriate
criteria for homeland missile defense that does not account for the
value of the "defending the homeland" objective is taking the issue out
of context. In other words, the appropriate level of investments in
time, money, and opportunity costs rise according to the relative
priority of the objective. The United States simply ought to be willing
to invest more in the most consequential missions than it is in the less
consequential missions.

Under the objective of "defending the homeland," U.S. officials could
plausibly decide U.S. policy will be to deter, and if necessary, defeat
and limit the damage from coercive missile strikes on the U.S. homeland,
no matter the attacker. This objective would necessarily be a high
priority, which means relatively more value would be placed on criteria
like "effectiveness" and "reliability" than on "cost." In this sense,
the relative priority given to the criterion "cost" only makes strategic
sense when properly placed in the context of what is at stake for U.S.
policy. Elevating the criterion of "cost effective at the margin" to the
level of a veto factor, as the Nitze criteria does in this case, makes
little sense when the United States certainly would be willing to bear
greater costs for a higher priority objective. Clearly, if the United
States intercepted 10 North Korean warheads headed towards major cities
in the U.S. homeland, no one with any sense would question the system's
value simply because it cost more, even substantially more, to intercept
those warheads than it did for North Korea to build and launch them.

A historical example makes clear the importance of first defining the
political objective and then, and only then, choosing the appropriate
corresponding criteria. In a classic RAND report on the subject of
defense acquisition, the authors Charles Hitch and Roland McKean employ
the example of the allies in World War II studying the various
alternatives to sink the most enemy ships at the least cost in man-years
of effort. As they point out, choosing the "sinking enemy ships"
criterion to measure gain was a poor choice because the real allied
objective was to stop enemy ships from achieving their objectives -- a
mission that does not actually require sinking ships and may be done
more cheaply through mine-laying for the same effect.82 In the same way,
the U.S. policy objective should not be "to intercept adversary
missiles" per se; instead, the objective should be to deter, and if
necessary, defeat and limit damage from coercive missile strikes against
the U.S. homeland -- an objective to which active missile defenses can
contribute. Once U.S. policy determines the political goals (deterrence
and damage limitation) and the stakes in achieving that goal (very
high), only then can one discuss costs, among other criteria, in a
realistic and contextually appropriate way.

Thus, the criterion for "cost-effectiveness" for missile defense must
encapsulate more than a purely financial comparison of unit costs
between a missile and the missile interceptor; an analysis that stopped
there covers only the "cost" in the term "cost-effective." The analysis
must answer the follow-on question: effective towards what end? This is
the question for policymakers -- once they answer that question, then
analysts can rationally debate the place for the "cost" criterion.

As a final exercise, it is useful to take the "Nitze criteria"
(effectiveness, survivability, and cost-effective at the margin) at face
value, eliminate one, and ask whether the United States might rationally
pursue a system that fulfills only two of the three criteria. The most
obvious scenario, as suggested by this analysis, is a system that is
effective and survivable, but still costs more to intercept a missile
than it does for the adversary to build and deploy the missile. Might it
be reasonable to pursue such a system? Even a cursory analysis of the
options indicates yes, such a course might be very reasonable given the
value of what is being defended.

[A [missile defense]{.mark} system]{.underline} that could effectively
defend itself and defeat 200 adversary missiles, for example, [[would be
of]{.mark} great [interest]{.mark} to the United States [even if it cost
more]{.mark} for the United States [to defend]{.mark} against those
missiles than it did for the adversary to employ them]{.underline}.
After all, [[at a certain point]{.mark} an [adversary must]{.mark} begin
to [consider if sending more]{.mark}]{.underline} than 200
[[missiles]{.mark} against the U.S. homeland to overcome the missile
defense system [risks appearing to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to be]{.mark} the [opening salvo of a first
strike]{.mark} -- [with the]{.mark} attendant [risk]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will respond]{.mark}]{.underline}
accordingly. Even if critics of missile defense would not choose this
option themselves, the point is that the ["cost-effective at the
margin"]{.underline} criterion for missile defense [should not have
veto-power over]{.underline} any possible [missile defense]{.underline}
system.

#### Adversaries use the [nuclear]{.underline}, not conventional, [theory of victory]{.underline} because their conventional military [is inferior]{.underline} to the US.

Following U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan tour in August
2022, Beijing paraded its nuclear-capable DF-5B intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in war games that were conducted near
Taiwanese waters. [[The DF]{.mark}-5B [ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline} has a
range of up to 9,321 miles, enabling it to reach North America.
Revealing the intention behind its parading, Yue Gang, a retired
People's Liberation Army ([[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark})
colonel, [[said]{.mark}, "It [is aimed at warning]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}]{.underline} and its close ally Japan [[not to intervene
in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} issue, [reminding them Beijing]{.mark}
has the most powerful weapon that [could give]{.mark} \[them\]
[a]{.mark} deadly [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[[Historically]{.mark}, the]{.underline} People's Republic of
[[China]{.mark} (PRC) [has been]{.mark} very [reticent about]{.mark}
engaging in [nuclear signaling]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [[one
would]{.mark} naturally [ask what is driving]{.mark} the [Chinese to
rely]{.mark} more [on]{.mark} their [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} arsenals now. Aren't Beijing's conventional
capabilities enough to deter a U.S. intervention in support of Taiwan?
[In fact, [Chinese]{.mark} anti-access/aerial-denial ([A2/AD]{.mark})
capabilities [are inadequate:]{.mark} they [will fail to hold]{.mark}
the [U.S.]{.mark} military [at bay]{.mark} while Beijing tries to
establish air and sea command in the Taiwan Strait [during]{.mark} an
[invasion]{.mark}]{.underline} of the island.

This admission may come as a surprise given the abundance of recent
analyses suggesting how China's rapid military modernization has
undermined the conventional deterrence capabilities of the United States
and its allies within the first island chain. Indeed, [[many
claim]{.mark} that Chinese [A2/AD]{.mark} systems [are]{.mark} already
[capable]{.mark} enough]{.underline} to hold the U.S. military at bay if
China were [[to invade Taiwan]{.mark}. Their [argument]{.mark} rests
on]{.underline} two assumptions. First, Taiwan's A2/AD assets will
capitulate under siege from a massive Chinese offensive that targets
Taiwanese air and naval bases, missile batteries, and command and
control centers (C2). Analysts believe that if Taipei's air defenses and
offensive forces collapse under assault from the PLA's 1,500
highly-accurate missiles and 1,000 advanced, combat-ready fighter
aircraft, the PRC will be able to establish air and sea command in the
Taiwan Strait, a prerequisite for the PLA's subsequent amphibious
landing on Taiwan.

Second, these [assessments [assert]{.mark} that [Beijing can
halt]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} military [by]{.mark}]{.underline}
initiating offensive cyberattacks and [[firing]{.mark} precision-guided
[munitions]{.mark}]{.underline} from trucks and small ships based on or
[near the PRC's territory]{.underline}. Using these cheap
platforms, analysts believe Beijing can asymmetrically [[fend off
Washington]{.mark} to deny the U.S. military air and sea
control]{.underline} near Chinese territory.

[Both [these assumptions have gaping holes]{.mark} in their
articulation]{.underline}. First, [there is an overemphasis on [an
unlikely]{.mark} scenario of a]{.underline} debilitating
[Chinese [sneak attack]{.mark} that catches Taiwan completely [by
surprise]{.mark}]{.underline}. A completely off-guard Taipei will lose
most of its missile batteries, aircraft, and ships, according to this
scenario. [With no advanced knowledge]{.underline} of the PLA attack,
[Taiwan will succumb. [In reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, Taiwan
is equipped with one of [[the best e]{.mark}arly [w]{.mark}arning
systems [in the world]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[will
allow]{.underline}]{.mark} the Taiwanese [[leadership to have]{.mark}
some advance [notice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elaborating further, Michael
Beckley writes:

> If Taiwan detected an impending PLA attack, it would quickly deploy
> its navy and disperse its combat aircraft among thirty-six airfields
> scattered around the island. Some of these locations have aircraft
> hangars built inside of mountains. Others have aircraft shelters with
> six-foot thick concrete walls. If PLA missiles cratered the runways at
> Taiwan's air bases, Taiwanese aircraft could operate from ten civilian
> airstrips and five highways that double as emergency air bases, all of
> which have fuel and supplies prepositioned for the air force.
> Meanwhile Taiwan's runway repair teams, which currently hold the world
> speed record for runway repair (three hours), would start patching the
> tarmac at the main air bases.

Taiwan's air defenses are also not as vulnerable as these assessments
presuppose. Taiwan has more than 500 long-range surface-to-air missile
launchers, 80 percent of which are road-mobile; thousands of short-range
surface-to-air missile launchers mounted to vehicles or carried by
ground troops; and around 400 road-mobile antiaircraft guns. All of
these will be pointed at incoming Chinese missiles and aircraft and
perhaps strike PLA bases and missile batteries in retaliation.

Other studies have similarly questioned the effectiveness of a Chinese
offensive against Taiwan. For example, in 2013, PLA computer
simulations found that PLA Air Force can only knock out a few Taiwanese
air bases for a few hours. Yet for the sake of conservatism, if we
assume that, indeed, the PLA could destroy most of Taiwan's air and
naval forces in a sneak attack and establish air and sea dominance
immediately, the question remains: will this lead to a successful
amphibious invasion of the island? Beckley is skeptical. He argues:

> ...unless China destroyed all of Taiwan's antiship missile launchers,
> Taiwan could "thin the herd" of PLA amphibious ships as they load in
> Chinese ports or transit the Taiwan Strait. Computer simulations
> suggest that Taiwan would only need to fire fifty precision-guided
> missiles to destroy a dozen Chinese amphibious ships, losses that
> would end all hopes of a successful invasion. Taiwan also could
> bombard PLA landing craft with short-range artillery fire as they made
> their final twenty-minute run into the beach. Even if China's
> prospects are better than I have suggested, the PLA clearly would have
> its hands full just dealing with Taiwan's defenders.

Regarding engaging American forces, if Taiwan fails to defend itself,
the RAND Corporation calculates that, [[in a surprise attack]{.mark},
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could lose its]{.mark} air
[bases]{.mark}]{.underline} in Japan [and, subsequently, as many as
seventy-eight aircraft]{.underline} in the process of winning back
command of Taiwanese skies. Beckley counters this assessment as well:

> Again, [[this]{.mark} scenario [assumes]{.mark} that the
> [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will refrain from attacking
> Chinese]{.mark} air [bases. In reality]{.mark}, if China attacked U.S.
> bases, [the U.S.]{.mark} military [would]{.mark} almost [certainly
> retaliate]{.mark} by cratering the runways at Chinese air
> bases]{.underline}. Computer [[simulations show]{.mark} that one week
> of [U.S.]{.mark} air [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, supplemented [by
> 200 Tomahawk missiles]{.underline} launched from two Ohio-class
> submarines, [[could]{.mark} \[[destroy]{.mark}\]]{.underline}
> ~~disable~~ [30 to 45 percent of [China's]{.mark} air [bases]{.mark}
> near Taiwan or all of the air bases near the South China
> Sea]{.underline}, and destroy 90 percent of the aircraft parked at
> these bases, [while losing few if any U.S. aircraft and no
> ships]{.underline} or submarines. [Thus, the United States can still
> "win"]{.underline} an air war against China with no help from allies,
> but it might lose dozens of aircraft in air-to-air combat and
> potentially many more on the ground if China attacks U.S. air bases.

In the arena of sea denial, [the U.S. Navy has the capability to sink
PLA]{.underline} Navy (PLAN) [ships and submarines virtually
anywhere]{.underline} in the first island chain. [Hamstrung by weak
antisubmarine capabilities, the PLAN cannot credibly deny the U.S.
Navy's]{.underline} missile-armed [submarines at war or even
peacetime]{.underline}. Aiding U.S. submarines' operational efficiency
is [America's vast undersea surveillance network]{.underline}, which
[can set up picket lines near]{.underline} the combat theater, or near
[China's ports, and]{.underline} help U.S. sailors [sink China's ships
and submarines]{.underline} with torpedoes, missiles, and mines.

The RAND Corporation concludes that [[eight]{.mark} U.S.
[sub]{.mark}marine[s can destroy]{.mark}]{.underline} almost 40 percent
of [[the PLAN's]{.underline}]{.mark} amphibious [[ships if]{.mark} they
[try to cross the]{.mark} Taiwan [Strait]{.mark}]{.underline}, while the
U.S. Navy is likely to lose only one submarine. RAND also estimates that
[this naval contest will become even more lopsided]{.underline} in the
South China Sea (SCS). [The waters of SCS have greater depth which will
give U.S. submarines]{.underline} equipped with better acoustics [more
room to operate underwater]{.underline}. U.S nuclear-powered submarines
(SSNs) diving further down into the SCS' depths will be a nightmare for
the PLA's meager anti-submarine warfare forces, which are incapable of
covering the depths of the region. Therefore, U.S submarines can
indiscriminately sink Chinese ships without fearing attacks of
reciprocal proportionality. [[Thus,]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has an overwhelming]{.mark} military [lead]{.mark} over
the PRC [in]{.mark} competing for dominance in a conflict over [Taiwan.
As a result]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [superior
conventional capabilities are driving the Chinese to rely more
on]{.mark} their [nuclear weapons]{.mark}. In the future, [Chinese
nuclear signaling will]{.mark} only [increase]{.mark}
further.]{.underline}

Setting [[restraints on]{.mark} U.S. [missile defense]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline}, especially systems [that defend the
continental United States, [could]{.mark}]{.underline} help slow or even
[[reverse]{.mark} the [erosion of nuclear stability with]{.mark} other
[great powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moving away from homeland defense
would allow the U.S. military to focus on developing and fielding
systems optimized to counter shorter-range missiles. Such a change in
missile defense policy would improve nuclear stability by reducing
adversary "use-or-lose" pressure in crises while also making it harder
for adversaries to initiate limited, regional conflicts.

Restraining homeland missile defense is a sensible policy shift for both
technical and strategic reasons. America's only homeland defense
system---the GMD---has the worst testing record of all currently
deployed missile defense systems.40 Current technical shortcomings can
presumably be solved, but the effort to develop and deploy the various
improvements will take a great deal of time and money---and there is no
guarantee the new technology will live up to expectations.41
[[Expanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the GMD while pursuing new [[homeland
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities [[will only deepen Russian and
Chinese concerns]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
building]{.mark} up missile [defense to make their]{.mark} own [nuclear
arsenals ineffective, which]{.mark} in turn [will encourage]{.mark} them
to make [counter moves that increase]{.mark} the [risk of nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}.42 Setting restraints on homeland missile
defense should be a low-hanging fruit for U.S. policymakers.

A restrained posture could entail a range of options, from capping the
capacity of existing systems to eliminating them entirely. While either
caps or divestment would be strategically sound, caps are more
politically expedient given current legislative and executive branch
support for missile defense. Introducing a hard ceiling on the number of
deployed GMD interceptors would be a good first step for limiting
homeland missile defense. According to current plans, by 2023, 64 GMD
interceptors will be deployed across two sites, with most (60) in Fort
Greely, Alaska.43 Capping the number at 64 would provide a degree of
protection against limited nuclear threats, such as North Korea. At the
same time, a cap would increase the credibility of U.S. assurances that
missile defense cannot reliably defend against more sophisticated
arsenals and therefore does not undermine the credibility of China's or
Russia's nuclear deterrent.

[However, since China and Russia have not been swayed by U.S. promises
to date, [merely setting a cap would not be
sufficient]{.mark}]{.underline}. Washington would also have to reclaim
its position as a leader in arms control to make the GMD cap more
compelling. Using the GMD cap as a carrot to get other great powers to
agree to similar limitations on their own missile defense systems, for
example, or to launch negotiations on strategic transparency, would
underscore Washington's commitment to nuclear stability even if its
broader relationships with China and Russia deteriorate. The diplomatic
and political opportunities created by an interceptor cap would be a
much more valuable tool for reinforcing nuclear stability than the cap
itself.

[A more ambitious form of American restraint would be a [complete
divestment from homeland]{.mark} missile [defense]{.mark}. Divestment
[would entail dismantling all]{.mark}]{.underline} GMD [[interceptors,
abandoning research]{.mark} and development [on]{.mark}]{.underline}
boost-phase [[defenses]{.mark} that engage enemy missiles]{.underline}
as they begin flight, and forswearing interceptors in outer space. In
this scenario, the various sensors that support homeland missile defense
would be solely focused on other missions, such as providing early
warning of nuclear attack or tracking objects in orbit.44 [Complete
[divestment]{.mark} from homeland missile defense [would send a strong
signal to]{.mark} other near-peer [competitors]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does not wish to negate their]{.mark}
nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Divestment from homeland missile defense would reinforce nuclear
stability]{.underline} in two ways. First, if rival [great powers have
faith in the effectiveness of their second-strike nuclear
forces]{.underline}, they will not face strong pressures to use their
nuclear forces quickly for fear of being disarmed. Reducing this
so-called use-or-lose incentive makes crises less prone to nuclear
escalation. Second, taking the homeland missile defense mission away
from U.S. early-warning satellites would help clarify the escalation
risks of attacking these systems; the link between attacks on U.S.
early-warning capabilities and the risk of a U.S. nuclear response would
be much more direct. This clarity would increase the costs of Chinese or
Russian offensive action in outer space, which is a more effective way
to deter attacks than the current U.S. approach that entangles nuclear
and nonnuclear systems in that domain.45

#### Missile defense destroys nuclear stability\-\--causes [extinction-risk]{.underline} arms races, [nuclearization of space]{.underline}, and [drives adversaries together]{.underline} against the US. 

**Kluth 25**, writer at Bloomberg, former Lecturer at the University of
California, Berkeley, MS in International Relations from the London
School of Economics, BA from William's College (Andreas Kluth, May 23,
2025, "A 'Golden Dome' Could Make America Less Safe," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-05-23/a-golden-dome-could-make-america-less-safe)

Start with [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[afflicts all]{.mark}
major]{.underline} (and minor) [[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, with or
without nukes. Hoping to makes itself safer, [[country A
develops]{.mark} new [defenses,]{.mark} but [those]{.mark}]{.underline}
defenses in turn [[make]{.mark} country [B feel less safe, prompting it
to]{.mark}]{.underline} arm or [[escalate]{.mark} and]{.underline}
thereby increase the threat to country A. At worst, [both]{.underline} A
and B enter a [spiral [toward war that leaves
everybody]{.mark}]{.underline} more vulnerable, or even
[[dead]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Even short of that, any major new weapons system, offensive or
defensive, is destabilizing. One example was Reagan's SDI. The nuclear
confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union had by the early 1980s
become stable thanks to Mutual Assured Destruction: Both powers were
vulnerable to a first strike by the adversary but also had enough nukes
to answer with a second strike that would obliterate the enemy, so that
each deterred the other.

Star Wars promised (Americans) and threatened (Soviets) to remove one
element of this MAD balance: America's vulnerability. The Kremlin, from
1985 led by Mikhail Gorbachev, didn't know whether SDI would ever work
but had to assume it could. In such a scenario, Washington might feel
protected from a second (retaliatory) strike by Moscow, which could
predispose it in a conventional conflict to escalate to a preemptive
nuclear attack. As a result, Star Wars, even though it was defensive,
made the Soviets feel less safe.

The Kremlin had no good options. Economically and technologically, the
Soviet Union was so far behind the US that building its own
missile-defense system was out of the question. If SDI had come close to
realization, the Soviets would have had to contemplate their own
preemptive strike against the US before it became invulnerable --- the
ultimate disaster. As it was, Gorbachev made SDI, along with missiles
and warheads, the subject of his arms-control negotiations with Reagan.
(A different leader might have acted less sagely.)

The situation today is different. First, [[the US
faces]{.underline}]{.mark} not just one threat but several: [the old
[nuclear]{.mark} "peer" in [Russia]{.mark}, the "near-peer"]{.underline}
rising nuclear power [of [China]{.mark}, the rogue atomic actors in
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea
([and]{.underline} possibly [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} if it builds a
bomb), [[and]{.mark} unpredictable players such as
[Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}. The main antagonists in war games are
[Russia and China. [They could collude in]{.mark} an [attack on the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike the old Soviet Union, China in
particular can also match the US economically and technologically and
build its own dome or new and more diabolical weapons.

It is already doing that, in fact. Like the US and Russia,
[China]{.underline} nowadays [has much faster missiles that can take
more eccentric flight paths]{.underline} and carry more independently
targeted warheads, [[overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[any
defensive system by]{.mark} sheer [numbers]{.mark}. Beijing also has a
hypersonic]{.underline} glide vehicle. Whereas ballistic missiles have
to re-enter the atmosphere in a predictable arc, these vehicles can
maneuver in the atmosphere, concealing their target --- and all of it
[at many times the speed of sound]{.underline}. If Golden Dome mainly
looks up at the skies, it might not catch these death darts coming in
low from the sides.

Moreover, many of the Golden Dome's sensors and interceptors would be
[[in space]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Seth Moulton, a congressman on the
House Armed Services Committee, pointed out during a hearing, the
[[Russians are]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly [[preparing]{.mark} to
place [nukes up there]{.mark}. Why wouldn't they]{.underline}, or the
Chinese, [[detonate those]{.underline}]{.mark} at the start of an attack
[[to take out]{.mark} the [American]{.mark}]{.underline} space
[[interceptors]{.mark} first?]{.underline} (Responding to Golden Dome,
the Chinese this week warned that it might turn "outer space into a
battlefield.")

And why only look up if the threat could also come from below? As
Moulton observed, submarines can launch nukes too and "you can run a
boat up into Los Angeles Harbor, right? It's clear that Golden Dome is
not designed to defend against that."

In short, new American defenses, even before they become operational,
will force adversaries to recalculate their own assumptions and
strategies. The Chinese have already said that they are "gravely
concerned" about [[Golden Dome]{.underline}]{.mark} and worry that it
[[will jeopardize]{.mark} "strategic balance and
[stability]{.mark}."]{.underline} One of their [fears]{.underline} is
that [the US, feeling secure]{.underline} from retaliation, [could
blackmail them]{.underline} with nuclear threats [to stand down in a
conflict]{.underline} over Taiwan.

#### No AFF offense: BMD is [ineffective]{.underline} and [worthless]{.underline}.

[The Failed]{.underline} Experiment of the [GMD System]{.underline}

[[After twenty years of]{.mark} dedicated effort and]{.underline}
unconstrained [[funding]{.mark}, the [GMD]{.mark}
system['s]{.mark}]{.underline} readiness is [still [in
doubt]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of June 2021, the GMD system [has
[been]{.mark}]{.underline} flight-[[tested twenty times]{.mark}.85 [Even
under idealized]{.mark} test [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[[only]{.mark} about [50 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of the attempts to
intercept targets [have [succeeded]{.mark}]{.underline}.86 Furthermore,
the first ten tests (with five successful intercepts) were conducted
using prototype interceptors or other surrogates that may not reflect
the abilities of the deployed interceptors. [The initial flight [tests
were]{.mark} conducted [with cued info]{.mark}rmation [rather
than]{.mark} information from the network of [sensors that would track
an]{.mark} incoming North Korean [ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline}.87 Several
[flight [tests]{.mark} were timed to [occur in]{.mark} the [daytime
and]{.mark} in [favorable weather]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby avoiding
the uncertainty of real-world conditions.88 Given these factors, [the
ability of the GMD]{.underline} system to now offer reliable defense
against North Korean ICBMs [has [caused]{.mark} even]{.underline} the
Joint Staff and other [[warfighters to question]{.mark} the
system's]{.underline} practical [[utility]{.underline}]{.mark}.89 In
addition to these shortcomings, debilitating programmatic failures and
conceptual [flaws have yet to be resolved]{.underline}.

Programmatic Failures: The Perpetual Search for a Kill Vehicle

[The GMD program [has yet to field a]{.mark} reliable [kill
vehicle]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first kill vehicle, the CE-I, was
deployed in 2004---three years before its first flight test.90
Similarly, the CE-II kill vehicle was deployed more than five years
before its first flight test.91 The decision to deploy these kill
vehicles as an operational system before testing not only weakened the
GMD system's reliability but also led to costly retrofits and delays.92
The MDA has since acknowledged that the CE-I and CE-II kill vehicle
designs were "costly to produce and sustain and require the warfighter
to fire more interceptors to overcome anticipated in-flight reliability
failures."93

In 2014, Frank Kendall, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition,
Technology, and Logistics, said [[the]{.mark} existing [CE-I and]{.mark}
CE-[II]{.mark} kill [vehicles]{.mark} were [plagued by "bad
engineering"]{.mark} because "there was a rush" to get something
out]{.underline}.94 He advocated for the development of a new and more
reliable kill vehicle. In 2014, the MDA began the Redesigned Kill
Vehicle (RKV) program to replace CE-I and CE-II kill vehicles.95

Learning from past mistakes, the MDA initially adopted a robust
development and deployment plan for the RKV program that included
rigorous testing and evaluation.96 But in October 2017, in response to
North Korean ICBM tests, these weapons acquisition best practices were
abandoned. The MDA was tasked with accelerating the RKV program by
"concurrently performing development and production and reducing the
number of necessary flight tests" to increase the number of deployed
interceptors from forty-four to sixty-four by 2023.97 The altered
deployment schedule forced [[the contractor]{.underline}]{.mark} to hire
several new personnel to work on the project and to [[use]{.mark}
"commercial [off]{.mark}-the-[shelf hardware]{.mark}]{.underline} and
re-use Aegis SM-3 Block IIA components," both of [which compromised
reliability]{.underline}.98 By 2018, the RKV program was over budget and
behind schedule, prompting the Department of Defense to terminate the
RKV program in August 2019 after determining that [its design
[flaws]{.mark} were [too severe]{.mark} to [be fixed quickly]{.mark} or
cheaply]{.underline}.99 Without an operable RKV, the plan to increase
the number of interceptors to sixty-four by 2023 is infeasible.100
Moreover, [the GMD]{.underline} system [will continue to operate with
CE-I and CE-II]{.underline} kill vehicles, further [eroding confidence
in its effectiveness]{.underline} in real-world conditions.101

We find that these failures are a result of the decisions to rush to
field the GMD system. The Bush administration empowered the MDA to
independently define system requirements, review its performance, and
establish and cancel programs without external review.102 The MDA was
also exempted from standard reporting and oversight on the program's
technological progress and cost increases.103 These exceptions allowed
the MDA to circumvent rigorous knowledge-based acquisition processes
that otherwise might have averted many of the [deficiencies]{.underline}
that [now plague the efforts to develop a kill vehicle]{.underline}.104
[The [next iteration]{.mark}]{.underline} of a kill vehicle, the
Next-Generation Interceptor (NGI), is estimated to cost \$18 billion and
[[is not]{.mark} expected to be [ready until]{.mark} the [late
2020s]{.mark}]{.underline}.105 [Even if a high-reliability interceptor
eventually emerges]{.underline} from the NGI program, [it must
overcome]{.underline} the enduring conceptual flaw of the GMD system:
[the countermeasures challenge]{.underline}.

Conceptual Flaw: The Countermeasures Challenge

Like all midcourse defense systems, the GMD system is vulnerable to
countermeasures.106 This vulnerability of midcourse missile defense
systems has long been well understood. Former Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger, recounting the U.S. reaction to Soviet missile defense
deployments in the 1960s, writes that the Soviet deployment provoked
extensive research to defeat the Soviet defenses.107 In a short time,
the United States had developed a variety of countermeasures to confuse,
deceive, and evade Soviet missile defenses.108 [[A high-altitude]{.mark}
nuclear [detonation]{.mark} is a particularly effective]{.underline}
countermeasure.109 In the case of the GMD system, [North Korea could
detonate a warhead just [outside]{.mark} the [range of
GMD]{.mark}]{.underline} interceptors, warheads could be designed to
detonate upon interceptor impact, [or an intercept could lead to a
nuclear detonation]{.underline} of a warhead that is not one-point
safe.110 In all these three instances, [the resulting]{.underline}
nuclear [explosion [would ionize]{.mark}]{.underline} a large volume of
space, [making accurate [radar tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} of
follow-on warheads [impractical]{.underline}.111

[[Decoys remain]{.underline}]{.mark} a major, if not
[[insurmountable]{.underline}]{.mark}, countermeasure to the GMD system.
Decoys [[such as lightweight balloons]{.mark} follow the same flight
path]{.underline} as missile warheads in the vacuum of space, [making it
difficult to distinguish]{.underline} between decoy and warhead using
only their trajectories. Moreover, [hiding a warhead inside a
balloon]{.underline} (i.e., an anti-simulation decoy) [is an effective
countermeasure]{.underline}. As Richard Garwin writes, "it may be very
costly and difficult to make decoys which resemble in all observable
respects real warheads in space, but it becomes a lot easier if the
warhead is first modified or enclosed in a balloon so that it looks like
a cheap decoy."112 A 2010 study by the scientific advisory group, JASON,
conducted at the request of the U.S. Congress, concluded that "given a
reasonable amount of time, money, initiative, and expertise, the offense
can (in principle) field countermeasures that the defense cannot handle
at any reasonable marginal cost."113

[There is [no evidence]{.mark} to indicate that the [GMD]{.mark} system
has [overcome this]{.mark} challenge]{.underline}. Additionally, a 2019

Chinese countermeasures, which are technologically mature and are
designed to breach the GMD system.118 Additionally, as long as it is
easier to refine countermeasures than to update the GMD system, any GMD
system refinements are unlikely to overcome this enduring conceptual
flaw.

**Schneider 24**, Ph.D., Senior Analyst with the National Institute for
Public Policy (Mark B. Schneider, February 29, 2024, "The Implication of
Russian Orbital Nuclear Weapons," Real Clear Defense,
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2024/02/29/the_implication_of_russian_orbital_nuclear_weapons_1015083.html)

[In February 2024]{.underline}, Congressman Mike [Turner]{.underline}
(R-OH) courageously [made public]{.underline} the fact
[that]{.underline}, "Today, the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence has made available to all Members of Congress information
concerning a serious national security threat. I am requesting that
President Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so
that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the
actions necessary to respond to this threat." (Emphasis in the
original). It was immediately reported in the press that this was [a
Russian program to place nuclear weapons in orbit for anti-satellite
purposes]{.underline}. Although the full story is not known and the
White House is attempting to minimize public perceptions of the
significance of this Russian threat, it has confirmed the main elements
of the press reports. In addition, National Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan revealed that before Congressman Turner's statement, the Biden
Administration intended to inform only very few members of Congress,
limiting the briefing to the most senior leadership, the so-called "Gang
of Eight." Moreover, the public would have been kept completely in the
dark.

The White House has confirmed Russia's development of a
nuclear anti-satellite weapon (ASAT). However, it is playing down its
significance. According to White House National Security Communications
Advisor Rear Admiral (U.S. Navy, ret.) John Kirby, "First, this is not
an active capability that's been deployed. And though Russia's pursuit
of this particular capability is troubling, there is no immediate threat
to anyone's safety. We are not talking about a weapon that can be used
to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth. That
said, we've been closely monitoring this Russian activity and we will
continue to take it very seriously." He also acknowledged this would be
a violation of 1967 Space Treaty. The White House gave no indication of
when this weapon would become operational.

President Biden's statement further sugar coated Russian behavior.

"First of all, there is no nuclear threat to the people of America or
anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment."

"No. 2, anything they're doing or they will do relates to satellites in
space and damaging those satellites potentially."

"No. 3, there's no evidence they've made a decision to go forward with
anything in space either."

Congressman Turner very politely characterized the White House position
as ["sleepwalking into an international crisis."]{.underline}
Unfortunately, a key element of the White House statements -- [the
[assertion]{.mark} that [a nuclear ASAT]{.mark} weapon [does not
threaten]{.mark} humans on the surface of [the earth -- is]{.mark}
simply [untrue]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is no difference between
high-yield nuclear weapons intended to destroy satellites on a large
scale and those intended to attack the surface of the earth with nuclear
EMP effects. Indeed, it is difficult to detonate a thermonuclear weapon
in near earth orbit without killing humans on the surface of the earth
or in aircraft flying above it through its nuclear electromagnetic pulse
(EMP) effects. The White House assertion confuses conventional with
nuclear ASATs despite the fact they are completely different. Contrary
to the White House statement, a nuclear ASAT can be deliberately
used "to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on
Earth."

[As documented]{.underline} in the reports of the Congressional
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Commission and in numerous publications
[by]{.underline} its Executive Secretary [the late Dr. Peter Pry, the
[effects of]{.mark} a nuclear [explosion]{.mark} in low-earth orbit
can [be devasting]{.mark} to human beings on the surface]{.underline}
of the earth [because they
[will destroy]{.mark}]{.underline} electronics and [[the]{.mark}
electrical power [grid]{.mark}]{.underline} over a vast area. According
to the Chairman of the EMP Commission Dr. William Graham, "China and
Russia have considered [limited nuclear attack options]{.underline}
that, unlike their Cold War plans, [employ EMP as the
primary]{.underline} or sole [means of attack]{.underline}."

President Biden's statement was intended to minimize public perceptions
of the significance of the Russian threat. The precise impact of a
nuclear detonation in low earth orbit depends upon: 1) the yield of the
weapon, 2) the design of the weapon and, 3) over what area the weapon is
detonated. However, it is certain to be serious. If the detonation was
over the United States, it could devastate large areas and in the worst
case destroy the electrical grid of the entire continental
United States with catastrophic consequences. While there would be
significant EMP effects under any circumstances, the inter-netting of
the U.S. energy grid (because the American left has almost prevented
construction of new power plants for several decades), creates a unique
vulnerability to nuclear EMP attack. [[If the]{.mark} electrical [grid
collapses, so does everything]{.mark} else]{.underline}. By manipulating
the height of burst, yield and possibly the weapons design, EMP effects
could also be used tactically in theater military operations.

The first deaths from a nuclear ASAT attack if detonated over inhabited
areas would be due to things like airplane crashes, failure of
electronic equipment and the demolition of emergency services. The
longer-term effects could be [up to [90% population deaths]{.mark}
within a year resulting [from starvation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
inconvenient fact is not included in the White House assessment. Nor
does the White House note the possible effects of a no warning EMP
attack on the U.S. National Command Authority which [[Russia]{.mark} has
[been threatening]{.mark} to [attack for]{.mark} a number of
[years]{.mark}. These threats have included President Putin himself.
These threats involved hypersonic missiles, but a no warning [orbital
EMP]{.mark} strike makes this threat even more serious]{.underline}. As
I wrote in 2019, "The threat to our national command authority undercuts
our nuclear deterrent potential. It may allow a large ICBM and/or SLBM
attack to arrive before any U.S. decision to retaliate....[This
[could]{.mark} easily [become]{.mark} the [Russian theory of
victory]{.mark}]{.underline} in a nuclear war."

There are some remote areas of the open ocean over which a low orbital
nuclear weapon could be detonated without large EMP effects on the
earth's surface because of lack of inhabited islands, and limited
shipping and airline traffic. This is clearly a best case scenario.
There is no guarantee where Russia might detonate its nuclear ASATs and
it may even want to inflict a low-level of EMP damage to the United
States and our allies as a nuclear warning shot. Moreover, these
locations may not be the most effective ones for prompt satellite
destruction.

Even in a best case situation, the impact of high-yield nuclear
detonations in low-earth orbit would be tremendously damaging to human
civilization. The commander of the German Space Command, Major General
Michael Traut, said a Russian nuclear weapon detonating in orbit could
mean "...more or less the end of the usability of that global
commons \[of orbit\]." In other words, a Russian nuclear detonation in
orbit would preclude for a significant period of time the use of low
earth orbits for the benefit of mankind. Furthermore, "Ludwig Möller,
the director of the European Space Policy Institute, predicted an
economic fallout of trillions of dollars in the banking and energy
sectors if Russia were to successfully knock out commercial satellites."

In an excellent 2022 article, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Vincent,
Director of Advanced Physics Courses at the Air Force Academy,
summarized the impact of thermonuclear detonations in near earth space:

> "A nuclear explosion in space disproportionately hurts the United
> States as the largest single investor in space capabilities. The
> United States nets almost \$200 billion per year of real gross
> output from its space assets."

"Most satellites with a line of sight to the nuclear detonation will be
destroyed from the resulting x-rays."

\[C\]ommercial satellites in low Earth orbit will be the first to fail
from continually passing through these particle hot spots."

"Military space assets will be degraded over time from the artificially
amped radiation belt created from the nuclear detonation..."

> "Military space capabilities for command and control along with
> reconnaissance assets may still function for a period following the
> detonation, but the economic impact of degraded informational space
> products will be immediate."

The situation could even be worse. Colonel Vincent assumed standard
high-yield types of thermonuclear weapons. There are enhanced EMP
weapons (tailored output) which have much lower yield but
produce higher levels of EMP. Russian development of nuclear weapons
with tailored effect began during the Soviet period. A declassified year
2000 Central intelligence Agency report discussed Soviet development of
tailored output nuclear weapons and stated that, "X-ray effects can be
used directly or indirectly against satellites or ICBMs in space because
there is no atmosphere to absorb them." Unlike the United States, Russia
continued nuclear weapons testing and development after the end of the
Cold War and reportedly has developed more advanced weapons designs. Two
Russian generals told the Congressional EMP Commission that, "Russia
designed an 'enhanced EMP' nuclear weapon." Indeed, even as far back as
the 1960s, the United States was able to develop a specialized nuclear
warhead "to engage clouds of reentry vehicles and decoys above the
atmosphere and destroy incoming warheads with a burst of high-energy x
rays. The \[Larwence Livermore National\] Laboratory stepped up to the
difficult challenge of designing the appropriate warhead. The Spartan
warhead had high yield, produced copious amounts of x rays, and
minimized fission output and debris to prevent blackout of ABM
radar\[s\]." X-rays are the main prompt satellite kill mechanism from
this nuclear detonation.

Admiral Kirby even acknowledged the impact of satellite destruction when
he said, "Any anti-satellite capability should be of general concern
because, you're right, there are private and public satellites circling
the Earth every day." He specifically listed the threat to
"communications, command and control...transportation...meteorological
concerns, financial, commercial concerns. [There are a lot of things
that satellites do for --- for the whole population of...\[the\]
Earth]{.underline}." While true, this gives no real feeling for the
scope of the damage. Admiral Kirby could have said something similar to
what the Associated Press reported: "Your home's [electrical and water
systems could fail]{.underline}. Aviation, rail, and car traffic could
come to a halt. Your cellphone could stop working."

The 2004 EMP Commission report noted the damaging impact of EMP on
commercial satellites and the fact that:

> The national security and homeland security communities use commercial
> satellites for critical activities, including direct and backup
> communications, emergency response services, and continuity of
> operations during emergencies. Satellite services are important for
> national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications
> because of their ubiquity and separation from other communications
> infrastructures.

Congressman Mike Waltz (R-FL), a member of the House Intelligence
Committee has stated, "[[If this]{.mark} weapon [is allowed to]{.mark}
fully [deploy]{.mark}]{.underline}, it could completely blind our
economy. It [would take out our GPS]{.underline}.... It could blind our
military. It is incredibly serious. [[It's a w]{.mark}eapon of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction, [not just us]{.mark} --- countries
[all over the world]{.mark}]{.underline}." His reference to GPS
satellites which are in high (geosynchronous) earth orbit suggests [the
weapon is more than just the detonation of a nuclear weapon in low
altitude space]{.underline}. Indeed, there may be more than one system
involved. One of them has even been announced by Russia but has almost
been completely ignored in the Western media.

The ASAT potential of thermonuclear detonations in low-altitude space
was demonstrated in 1962 in the 1.4 megaton Starfish Prime nuclear test
which "pumped" the Van Allen Radiation Belts increasing its electron
density and even damaging a communications satellite launched the
day after the test. The test also burned out electronics in Hawaii 800
miles away. Today, the effect would be considerably worse due to the
fact that modern electronics are inherently more vulnerable than those
that existed in 1962.

There is a possibility that the Russian weapon system is more than a
simple nuclear weapon used for ASAT purposes. It may be a nuclear
explosive driven directed energy weapon. Former Director of Central
Intelligence and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has stated the
threat was Russia "blinding" our satellites. "Blinding" implies a
directed energy weapon. It also implies a power level less than full
destruction of the targets since the optics are more vulnerable and
easier to damage. Keep in mind that Mr. Panetta's national security
involvement is a decade old, and Russia could have made a lot of
progress since then.

Reportedly, the Russian nuclear ASAT "could disable civilian
communication, GPS, surveillance from space, and military command and
control." Most of these are high altitude satellites which can't be
neutralized by a low altitude nuclear EMP pulse, but they potentially
could be knocked out by a nuclear explosive powered directed energy
weapon. If exploded in low-earth orbit, such a weapon would also
generate nuclear EMP that would devastate low-altitude satellites, but
the directed energy aspect of the weapon would be the kill mechanism
against high altitude satellites if the power output was sufficiently
high and/or the system was put into very high or elliptical orbits. As
noted above, Congressman Waltz said that the Russian weapons could
"blind our military" and disable "civilian communication, GPS,
surveillance from space, and military command and control." If detonated
in high earth orbit, nuclear EMP is not in play because there is not
enough residual atmosphere at these altitudes to generate substantial
EMP. A nuclear armed ASAT weapon detonated in high earth orbit even
without the directed energy capability can destroy high altitude
satellites but not through EMP but rather through prompt nuclear
radiation although at much shorter range. The effective range would be
determined by its power and the hardness of the target. A nuclear bomb
powered directed energy weapon could be very effective. If it is further
developed, it might evolve into a nuclear detonation powered missile
defense system. Despite Mr. Panetta's statement, the United States is
clearly not developing comparable systems at present. Indeed, President
Biden ordered a ban on testing of even non-nuclear ASAT systems.

During the late Cold War, the United States reportedly had a missile
defense program (Excalibur) involving a nuclear explosive powered X-ray
laser. It reportedly had a multi-target capability \-- "each bomb could
energize many separate X-ray emitters - about fifty seems to be the
usual number, though some accounts go as high as 100,000..." Such a
system could be used for ASAT purposes. If detonated sufficiently high
in space, it is capable of being aimed at specific satellites without
damaging or destroying other satellites unlike a simple nuclear bomb
detonated in low-earth orbit which would indiscriminately destroy
satellites. According to the Department of Energy, a nuclear detonation
driven directed energy weapon "could have lethal ranges of thousands
of kilometers." The kill mechanism of an X-ray laser destroys by means
of "ablative shock." The heat effect of the X-rays impacting the surface
of the target generates a shock wave inside it destroying its
functionality. Other concepts for nuclear explosive driven directed
energy weapons include visible light, microwaves, and charged particles.
It could be put into an orbit that was high enough to eliminate
significant EMP effects on the surface of the earth while attacking
high-altitude satellites. Concerning potential power and range, keep in
mind that the U.S. research and development is more than 30 years old.

The [Biden]{.underline} Administration's [emphasis on the status of the
Russian nuclear ASAT as under development is interesting because there
is not really that much to develop if it is simply a device to detonate
a nuclear weapon in low earth orbit]{.underline}. The apparently leaked
story that "it is not clear Moscow has the ability to successfully
launch it into orbit if it does perfect its weapon" lacks plausibility.
If this system is just designed to detonate a thermonuclear weapon in
low earth orbit, [there would be no significant technical barriers to
its deployment. Existing satellites and nuclear weapons could be
combined to create an orbital nuclear bomb without doing a great deal of
R&D.]{.underline} It is a straightforward engineering exercise. A
nuclear explosive driven directed energy weapon is something very
different. It would probably take a great deal of R&D work.
Putin's revocation of Russia's Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty ratification may be a precursor to resumed high-yield nuclear
testing which would very useful for the development of nuclear explosive
driven directed energy weapons.

Russia has denied the reports that it is developing the capability of
putting nuclear weapons in space. According to President Putin, "We have
always been categorically against the deployment of nuclear weapons in
space and we are still against it." He conveniently ignored the fact
that [[Russia]{.mark} in 2023 [announced]{.mark} that [its]{.mark}
new nuclear-armed [Sarmat]{.mark} "super heavy" ICBM [had]{.mark} an
[orbital capability]{.mark} to attack the United States [over the south
pole]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2018, President Putin stated that the
"[Sarmat will be equipped with a broad range of powerful
nuclear warheads]{.underline}\..." The Congressional Commission on the
Strategic Posture of the United States reported that, "The Sarmat [has
displayed at least partial orbital
trajectory capabilities]{.underline}." General Anthony Cotton, Commander
of U.S. Strategic Command, has confirmed the orbital capability of the
Sarmat even hinting [it might go beyond "partial orbital
trajectories."]{.underline}

Clearly the main role of the Sarmat is nuclear attack against ground
targets but [there is no reason that [its warheads could]{.mark} not [be
detonated]{.mark} in orbit [and function as]{.mark} a [nuclear
ASAT]{.mark}. There is a possibility that the [orbital Sarmat could be
linked to]{.mark} the [Russian]{.mark} orbital [nuclear
ASAT]{.mark}]{.underline}. If so, the Biden Administration's [statements
that the Russian system cannot harm people]{.underline} on the surface
of the earth [are clearly disingenuous]{.underline}.

Had Excalibur been developed when President Reagan was in office, he
might have used it to defend against a Soviet nuclear attack. [If
President Putin gets a weapon]{.underline} like Excalibur (and today
there is no competition in its development), [he might use it to
facilitate a nuclear attack]{.underline}.

doomsday device," Business Insider India,

[[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark} built [[a]{.mark} new
[100-megaton]{.mark} underwater [nuclear doomsday device]{.mark}
and]{.underline} repeatedly [threatened the US with it]{.underline}.

[The device]{.underline} goes beyond traditional ideas of nuclear
warfighting and [[poses a]{.mark} direct [threat to]{.mark} the [future
of human]{.mark} or [life]{.mark} on Earth]{.underline}.

Nobody has ever built a weapon like this before because there\'s almost
no military utility to so badly destroying the world.

But an expert on nuclear strategy told Business Insider the weapon may
have a larger role in helping Russian President Vladimir Putin break
down NATO with the threat of nuclear destruction.

Ever since 2015 when images of a Russian nuclear torpedo first leaked on
state television, the world has asked itself [why Moscow would build a
weapon that [could]{.mark} potentially [end all life]{.mark} on
Earth]{.underline}.

While all nuclear weapons can kill thousands in the blink of an eye and
[leave [radiation poisoning]{.mark} the environment for years to
come]{.underline}, Russia\'s new doomsday device, called [the
\"[Poseidon]{.mark},\" [takes steps to maximize this]{.mark}
effect]{.underline}.

If the US fired one of its Minutemen III nuclear weapons at a target, it
would detonate in the air above the target and rely on the blast\'s
incredible downward pressure to crush it. The fireball from the nuke may
not even touch the ground, and the only radiation would come from the
bomb itself and any dust particles in air swept up in the
explosion, Stephen Schwartz, author of \"Atomic Audit\" previously told
Business Insider.

But [Russia\'s [Poseidon]{.mark} reportedly [uses a warhead hundreds of
times stronger]{.mark}, and perhaps even as strong as the largest bomb
ever detonated]{.underline}. Additionally, [[it will come into]{.mark}
direct [contact with water]{.mark}]{.underline}, marine animals, and the
ocean floor, [[kicking up]{.mark} a [radioactive tsunami that]{.mark}
could [spread]{.mark} deadly [radiation over]{.mark} hundreds of
[thousands of miles]{.mark}]{.underline} of land and sea, [[rendering it
uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark} for decades.

Preparing To Deploy Its Nuclear Doomsday Drones On Submarines," The
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-preparing-deploy-its-nuclear-doomsday-drones-submarines-94151)

However, [[there are]{.mark} strategic [benefits to]{.mark} a weapon
like [Poseidon]{.mark} that may [not]{.mark} be [readily
apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}. First and foremost, Poseidon
[[enhances]{.mark} Russia's [nuclear threat by diversifying]{.mark} its
[first-strike]{.mark} capability]{.underline}. That is, the Russian
military believes that [[it travels too fast and]{.mark} too
[deep]{.mark} underwater [to be intercepted]{.mark}]{.underline} by
torpedoes or otherwise countered. To the Kremlin, [Poseidon is [yet
another way to circumvent
America's]{.mark} formidable [strategic]{.mark} missile
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline} network.

But [[even if countermeasures can]{.mark} reliably [prevent
Poseidon]{.mark}]{.underline} from destroying coastal cities, [it [still
possesses]{.mark} a large [destabilizing potential]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example: detonating Poseidon off America's coast will at the [very
least [inflict]{.mark} mass political [panic]{.mark} and military
confusion]{.underline}, which can be used as cover for a different
offensive operation.

Secondly, Russian media have floated the possibility of [Poseidon being
deployed against aircraft carriers and other surface
vessels]{.underline}; to this end, it can be armed with a conventional
payload. Depending on Poseidon's production costs and
price-to-performance numbers, this can prove to be a more cost-effective
way to neutralize carriers than swarms of conventional air and
surface-launched missiles. Finally, the unconventional threat posed by
Poseidon may be a source of Russian leverage in ongoing arms reduction
talks with the US.

Still, Poseidon is by no means a decisive advancement of Russian nuclear
capabilities. What it does offer\-- provided that it lives up to its
technical potential\-- are [[strategic benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [can [complement Russia's nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} and

All three forms of nuclear-conventional intermingling have significantly
increased since the end of the Cold War, driven by both technological
and doctrinal changes.4 However, there are important differences in the
rationale behind, and also the risks associated with these three
different forms of intermingling. The mere existence of dual capable
systems is not new--- deploying such systems can increase the
effectiveness of forces, and it can also provide more flexibility. [The
major [powers]{.mark} have both [employed]{.mark} and threatened with
[dual capable systems for decades]{.mark}, and they have done so
[without]{.mark} nuclear [escalation]{.mark}.5 \[\[FN 5\]\] 5

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nuclear-Entanglement-IBv7.pdf.
[\[\[END FN 5\]\]]{.underline} [Similarly, the major powers co-located
nuclear and conventional systems in the Cold War]{.underline}, and they
did so for variety of reasons that had nothing to do with complicating
the adversary's risk calculus. The Soviet Union, for example, decided to
co-locate its nuclear and conventional forces for economic and
administrative reasons. [[Although today]{.mark} it might be recognized
as a useful deterrent tool]{.underline}, it was not their primary
intention. Major powers want to convince rivals that the
[[co-location]{.mark} of forces]{.underline} creates a high bar for
targeting and [[raises]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}, but they also want to have the
flexibility of this not being true in an actual crisis or conflict.

Thus, we believe that the front-line of risks is not the weapons systems
themselves, or the co-location of nuclear and conventional forces.
Instead, the key drivers of instability are the threats to dual purpose
command and control and military situational awareness systems.
Technological developments in the [cyber and outer space domains
created]{.underline} a number of new non-nuclear [[threats
against]{.mark} both nuclear forces and their [c]{.mark}ommand
a[n]{.mark}d [c]{.mark}ontrol systems]{.underline}. With the rapid
advancements in conventional precision-strike capabilities, today there
is a wide array of kinetic and non-kinetic threats that [[could
undermine]{.mark} the effectiveness of nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} and
create new sources of crisis instability]{.underline}. As a result of
the growing number of threats, command and control systems have also
become more vulnerable. Since the end of the Cold War, many
[[redundancies]{.mark} have [been eliminated]{.mark} in command and
control systems, making them less resilient, and [creating]{.mark}
strong [incentives to strike first]{.mark} in a crisis.
[Although]{.mark} these actions remain [risky, there is]{.mark} a strong
potential for [a high pay-off]{.mark}]{.underline}. In parallel to these
changes, the United States, [Russia]{.underline} and China have [all
increased their reliance on dual use command and control
assets]{.underline} that support both conventional and nuclear
operations. These overlaps make it more likely that nuclear command and
control would be under threat from the early onset of a conventional
conflict between the great powers. Lastly, important [doctrinal changes
have also contributed to increased nuclear-conventional
intermingling]{.underline}. All three major powers have military
doctrines that in case of a conventional conflict would call for attacks
on space- and land-based command and control systems. Due to the dual
use nature of these systems, this could also include assets that are
essential for nuclear operations, like [for example early warning
radars]{.underline}. As a result of these factors, nuclear-conventional
intermingling is likely to be a salient factor in U.S. and competitor
decision making in crisis and conflict, and threats to dual use command
and control [will be the significant factor driving up the risk of
miscalculation]{.underline}.

The emerging strategic environment between the U.S., Russia and China
with cyber and counterspace weapons backed by kinetic strike
capabilities presents a new set of options to strike at command and
control systems. These threats to command and control present new
avenues to first strike instability, in that military actions grounded
in emerging doctrine and force structure at the outset of a conventional
conflict could very conceivably result in inadvertent nuclear
escalation. 6,7 In a crisis, each side will be considering what risks
they can take that will gain them an upper hand in bargaining and a
greater potential to win if the crisis escalates. One of the early risks
each side will consider is whether to attack the other side's command
and control, specifically using cyber or counterspace capabilities that
are largely unseen by the public eye and by third parties. Attacks
against these systems that are either reversible or of limited
scale---limited to a region rather than the system as a whole---are
likely to be attractive as they convey a willingness to run risks in a
way that is both unseen by the international community, and that
provides a military advantage for the next stage of the crisis. Besides,
such attacks can also create disruptive effects without directly
resulting in casualties, and the likelihood of delayed attribution could
further benefit the attacker. As crisis turns to conflict, these same
systems will likely become targets for kinetic or irreversible attack,
as will the end weapon system platforms themselves. Thus, dual-purpose
command and control is the key intermingling driver for crisis
instability and miscalculation in the years ahead, not the colocation of
nuclear and conventional forces nor the fielding of dual capable
systems.

Nuclear-Conventional Intermingling: Red and Blue

The U.S. military has long undertaken nuclear and conventional
comingling in a number of ways, and increasingly Russian and Chinese
counterparts are doing the same. The U.S. Air Force has long used dual
capable aircraft as well as strategic bombers, some of which can carry
both conventional and nuclear weapons systems. Further, individual
weapon systems like the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) have had
dual nuclear and conventional versions. The comingling of nuclear and
conventional weapons for the U.S. air and sea legs of the triad makes
for a more flexible and more effective force. However, to support this
more flexible force the U.S. Air Force---and now also the U.S. Space
Force---has also had to field a command and control system which, in
turn, also has dual purpose nuclear and conventional capability riding
on it. And further, the Space Force also has long utilized a system of
ground-based radars used for both space surveillance and early warning,
as well as an architecture of overhead infrared satellites for missile
launch warning in high orbits that have strategic, tactical and
intelligence missions. 8 As a whole, the U.S. has long utilized
comingling to make its force more effective, more flexible, and at a
lower cost. And to protect itself doctrinally, the US has declared that
both nuclear and non-nuclear attacks against command and control
systems---including space assets---could yield a nuclear response.

[Russia]{.underline} similarly [has long comingled]{.underline} some of
its [key tactical weapon systems, namely the Iskander theater missile
system as well as their Kalibr cruise missiles]{.underline}, to name a
few. Russia continues the Soviet tradition of co-locating its nuclear
and general-purpose forces in the sea and air legs. Russia keeps its
strategic submarines and bombers at the same bases as general purpose
naval vessels and aircraft. [[In]{.mark} case of a]{.underline}
conventional [[conflict with NATO, strikes]{.mark} that [target
Russia's]{.mark} conventional [forces could]{.mark} accidentally
[destroy nuclear assets]{.mark}, which would [have serious]{.mark}
escalatory [potential to]{.mark} a [nuclear war---although]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n side [would]{.mark} likely [understand]{.mark} that
attacks against predominantly conventional force locations would [not
necessarily]{.mark} signal [a]{.mark}n incoming, overwhelming [strategic
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. While details on Russia's command and
control systems are more scarce, it is similarly plausible that they too
have space-based and terrestrial systems which carry both strategic and
tactical command and control. [Its strategic early warning radars have a
dual purpose role]{.underline} in space surveillance, potentially making
them a target of early U.S. strikes in a conflict to blunt ability to
use its Russia's counterspace weapons. The Russian Federation's 2020
nuclear policy update discusses in detail the risks it perceives to its
deterrent from missile defense, conventional precision strike and
directed energy weapons and threatens preemptive nuclear use if their
critical government or military sites enabling nuclear response come
under attack, or if the fundamental existence of the state is threatened
with conventional weapons.9

China's intermingling of nuclear and conventional systems is less clear,
in line with their general approach of opacity when it comes to nuclear
issues. However, it is clear that China is also building up missile
defense radars and space surveillance systems, as well as the general
capability to support a potential future launch on warning capability.10
China's PLA Rocket Force is also fielding the dual capable DF-26 missile
system with intermediate range, which also ostensibly must have dual
strategic and theater communications supporting infrastructure. Although
China likely did not intentionally entangle its nuclear and conventional
forces to deter its adversaries from attacking the latter, it has
discovered benefits of such intermingling and may believe that
separation would increase the vulnerability of its conventional assets.
11

The Ways and Means of Attacking Intermingled Systems

The U.S. is continuing to expand both its strategic missile defense and
counterforce capabilities. Planned missile defense capability
improvements include fielding the long range discriminating radar which
will improve the lethality of missile defense interceptors, increasing
the number of deployed mid-course interceptors---going from 44 to 63
Ground-based Interceptors as early as 2023, and potentially up to 100 in
the outyears---while also improving the Aegis SM-3 block IIA which could
have future ICBM intercept capability.12 The U.S. is also investing in
expanded missile capabilities like the multi-object kill vehicle for
MIRV intercept, the space-based sensing layer, and possible future boost
phase intercept concepts.13 For conventional precision strike, the U.S.
has been advancing hypersonic weapons to include "Conventional Prompt
Strike" for Virginia class submarines and guided missile destroyers, as
well as U.S. Air Force concepts for air-launched hypersonic weapons.14
These conventional kinetic weapons have intermediate class ranges from
aircraft or navy vessels operating near adversary air defenses, likely
making them capable of attacking adversary nuclear forces if they are
enabled by near real-time and highly persistent reconnaissance data.
Lastly, the U.S. has also developed world leading cyber attack
capabilities through U.S. CYBERCOM, and it has also deployed an
offensive electronic attack capability called the "Counter
Communications System" fielded by the U.S. Space Force.15

Russia has been modernizing its longstanding silo-based strategic
missile defense system around Moscow, with 68 nuclear-armed
interceptors, as well as hundreds of S-300 and S-400 launch vehicles,
each capable of firing four interceptor missiles. Russia is also
developing the S-500 as an even more modern and technologically advanced
air and missile defense system to augment the S-300 and S-400.16 Russia
appears to be completing the modernization of its missile defense radars
and has launched three infrared early warning satellites since 2010.17

Russia is also developing and deploying a range of reversible and
kinetic conventional strike systems to counter the U.S.'s precision
strike advantage. In 2018, Russia delivered a laser weapon system to the
Aerospace Forces that is likely intended for an anti-satellite mission.
In public statements, President Putin called it a "new type of strategic
weapon," and the Russian Defense Ministry stated that it is capable of
"fighting satellites in orbit" and that it is being deployed to mobile
missile garrisons to cover their maneuvering positions.18 Since at least
2010, the Russian military has also prioritized the development of
forces and capabilities, including cyberspace operations, to pursue
information superiority. Russia continues to research and develop
co-orbital capabilities that could conduct an attack resulting in
temporary or permanent damage. Russia is also likely developing a
ground-based, mobile missile system capable of destroying space targets
in lower orbits as well as ballistic missiles. This weapon system is
expected to be operational within the next several years.19

China is developing nascent strategic missile defense systems as well as
counterspace weapons to both disrupt and destroy U.S. space-based
command and control. Given that China's nuclear use posture has long
been countervalue oriented---targeting cities rather than military
systems---it is unlikely that its few hundred nuclear missiles that can
reach the continental U.S. (some with multiple warheads) could attrit
more than a small portion of the combined U.S. ICBM and bomber force,
even with aggressive assumptions about accuracy of their missiles and
the sophistication of their warhead fusing systems. The PLA has not yet
moved to deploy intercontinental range, precision strike conventional
systems that could give them non-nuclear, kinetic counterforce
capabilities against U.S. strategic forces.

China is developing kinetic-kill vehicle technology to field a
mid-course missile defense interceptor, which will form the upper layer
of a multi-tiered missile defense system. 20 It is also developing the
HQ-19 mid-tier interceptor based on the Russian S-300 system. The U.S.
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reports that China is developing
sophisticated on-orbit capabilities to enable future counterspace
weapons, which will form the foundation for on-orbit weapons to counter
U.S. command and control assets in high orbits. The PLA has an
operational ground-based anti-satellite missile intended to target
satellites in low orbits, and has formed units that train with
anti-satellite missiles perhaps in part to counter U.S. precision strike
targeting. China probably intends to pursue additional anti-satellite
weapons capable of destroying satellites up to geostationary orbit, such
as U.S. dual missile warning and command and control satellites. 21 This
would be a notable development because if China moves to deploy longer
range kinetic anti-satellite weapons, it could target critical strategic
U.S. military satellites that link forward deployed nuclear forces, like
strategic bombers or submarines, to the National Command Authority in
the continental U.S. Additionally, China is developing jammers to target
satellite communications over a range of frequency bands, including
military protected extremely high-frequency communications.22

And as we have already mentioned, the observation that China is rapidly
expanding their silo-based ICBM force along with a launch under attack
capability could allow them to hedge against U.S. conventional damage
limitation capabilities by requiring a large-scale nuclear attack to
have a credible ability to disarm their nuclear forces. The question is
whether these more aggressive nuclear use postures are credible in a
conventional counterforce exchange, which the Chinese have left vague
through their policy of limited ambiguity.

Implications for Crisis Stability, Decision Making, and Miscalculation

In our judgment the U.S. and Russia are continuing a long tradition of
intermingling nuclear and conventional systems, and the Chinese---while
sufficiently opaque---may also be entering this fray. However, different
forms of intermingling carry different levels of risk. As we argued
earlier, the primary source of concern is not the possession of dual
capable weapons systems, but rather dual purpose command and control and
military situational awareness systems.

The new urgency on this topic is driven by three important changes in
the security environment. First, China's recent moves toward strategic
symmetry with the U.S. and Russia via the enormous growth of its
strategic silo based nuclear force and its in-process shift to a launch
on warning posture---which will rely on prompt command and control and
ballistic missile early warning---to enable silo force survivability, 2)
the rapid emergence of U.S., Chinese and Russian counterspace and cyber
weapons which can target C2 and ballistic missile early warning, and 3)
the shared perception that these new weapons are threats to nuclear
command and control, therefore driving a shared sense of strategic
instability and fear over surprise attack.

Russia and China develop missile defense and counterforce capabilities
of their own to create symmetry with the U.S. in force structure. These
capability developments will destabilize the competition unless the U.S.
is able to prioritize defensive investments to secure its nuclear forces
and command and control. However, highly effective Russian and Chinese
counterforce and missile defense capabilities are very unlikely to
emerge before 2030.

The anarchic nature of the international system often puts states at
tension with one another over geopolitical disputes. Accordingly, states
may find themselves in politically strained situations with other
nuclear armed nations, in which the amorphous nature of military
capabilities makes them feel threatened by the other and stumble into
spirals of hostility and competitive military preparations. Thus,
[[fears over surprise]{.mark} attack can be an [engine]{.mark} of
significant [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} in a conventional war among
nuclear states. The ingredients of such escalation are as follows:

• In a crisis, militaries on each side will be watching closely for
signs of attack against their [[nuclear forces]{.underline}]{.mark} and
supporting infrastructure, as they [[are]{.mark} a [vital]{.mark}
interest [for state survival]{.mark}]{.underline} if a conflict breaks
out.

• Conventional operations seeking only to produce theater effects may
also have deleterious consequences for nuclear forces, either through
direct attacks on dual nuclear-conventional weapons systems, or through
attacks on dual nuclear-conventional infrastructure like command and
control or early warning systems. In this way, [even conventional force
[operations]{.mark} that are [designed to solely have
conventional]{.mark} force [impacts may]{.mark} also
[accidentally]{.mark} or inadvertently [affect nuclear
forces]{.mark}.]{.underline}

• These impacts on nuclear forces may be sufficiently obscure that they
are not foreseen by military planners or understood by civilian
authorities.

• Harsh [reactions]{.underline} by the threatened party [may be
perceived as some new malign intent rather than as a reaction to the
other's own]{.underline} hostile [conventional force
operations]{.underline}.

• As conventional conflict is already underway, [[a spiral]{.mark} of
action and reaction [may be]{.mark} much more
[extreme]{.mark}]{.underline} than in peacetime.

Similarly, [[in any]{.mark} conventional air
[campaign]{.mark}]{.underline} against mainland targets, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is likely to try]{.mark}
to]{.underline} degrade, disable, or [[destroy]{.mark} the
[ground]{.mark}-based [radars and]{.mark} air [defenses protecting
Chinese conventional forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially the missile
forces relevant to a Taiwan campaign. But [[doing so will]{.mark} also
[create corridors through which]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} potentially conduct a surprise
[attack]{.mark} on [China's nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear
force[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}---including, in the future, its apparently
re-emerging nuclear bomber force. Again, attacks on legitimate
conventional targets could leave components of China's nuclear arsenal
more vulnerable to further attack.

Of course, each aspect of this potential infringement on China's nuclear
forces would be subject to the contingencies of any particular scenario,
and it is possible that taken in isolation, each component would not
necessarily be alarming to Chinese leaders. For example, even if the
United States severely degraded China's intermediate range ballistic
missile force and the air defenses protecting it, China would still have
several brigades of intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles located
far from any fight over Taiwan in far western China.

Nevertheless, [[the]{.mark} overall [picture would]{.mark} probably [not
be]{.mark} a [comforting]{.mark} one [to Chinese leaders: attacks
on]{.mark} their [theater]{.mark} nuclear [forces and]{.mark} supporting
[bases]{.mark}, launch sites, [infrastructure]{.mark}, and possibly
command and control networks; a [degradation of]{.mark} the
[e]{.mark}arly [w]{.mark}arning radars [and air defense]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} protecting other components of China's land-based
nuclear arsenal; the [loss of communication with its ballistic missile
submarine forces]{.underline}; the degradation of the escort submarines
needed to protect those boomers.

Assessing this pattern of damage to their nuclear forces,
[[Chinese]{.mark} leaders [might]{.mark} come to [think]{.mark} that
[Washington had aims beyond winning the]{.mark} conventional
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}---that the United States might be seeking to
disable or destroy China\'s nuclear arsenal outright, even the
intercontinental ballistic missiles located deep in the country\'s
interior, perhaps as a prelude to regime change. For years, observers
have pointed to the U.S. military's failed attempts to locate and
destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1990-91 Gulf War as evidence that
mobile missiles are virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the
thinking goes, China could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what
harm U.S. forces inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research
suggests otherwise. 20 Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles are
larger and less mobile than the Iraqi Scuds were, and they are harder to
move without detection. The United States is also likely to have been
tracking them much more closely in peacetime. As a result, China is
unlikely to view a failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as
reassurance that its residual nuclear force is safe today, especially
during an ongoing, high-intensity conventional war.

China's vehement criticism of a U.S. regional missile defense system
designed to guard against a potential North Korean attack already
reflects these latent fears.21 Beijing's worry is that this system could
help Washington block the handful of missiles China might launch in the
aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal. That sort of campaign might
seem much more plausible in Beijing's eyes if a conventional war had
already begun to seriously undermine other parts of China's nuclear
deterrent. It does not help that China\'s real-time awareness of the
state of its forces would probably be limited, since blinding the
adversary and deliberately imposing the "fog of war" on opponents are
standard parts of the U.S. military playbook.

At that point, the question becomes, how will China react? Will it
practice restraint and uphold its no-first-use pledge once its nuclear
forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons while it
still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt the U.S.
campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down?

Beijing's answers to these questions have grown somewhat ambiguous in
recent years. Although officially China continues to adhere
categorically to its no-first-use pledge, some PLA officers have written
publicly that China should signal that it might use nuclear weapons in
the event that a conventional war threatened China's nuclear arsenal or
the survival of the regime.22 However, this is not an official stance,
and even so, which exact set of capabilities China would consider part
of its core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial
remains unclear. For example, if China already recognizes that its
sea-based nuclear deterrent is relatively small and vulnerable, then
seeing it become even more vulnerable in a war might not prompt any
radical discontinuity in Beijing's calculus.

The danger lies in wartime developments that could shift China's
assumptions about U.S. intentions. [[If Beijing interprets]{.mark} the
[erosion of its]{.mark}]{.underline} sea- and land-based [nuclear
[forces as a]{.mark} deliberate [effort to destroy its nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline} through conventional counterforce, or
perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear counterforce, [[it might see
limited nuclear escalation as a way to force an end]{.mark} to the
conflict]{.underline}.23 For example, [[China could]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Nuclear Balance and Crisis Outcomes

[We must both assess the impact of nuclear superiority at high levels of
disparity and investigate whether inferior states face high
stakes]{.underline}. We test our theory using nuclear crisis data from
the ICB dataset, which includes 24 unique crises involving 9 unique
nuclear-armed states. Note that the dyadic structure of the ICB data
presents a limitation, since crises often involve more than 2 states. In
Online Appendix D, we collapse all dyads in which allied states shared
similar goals in a crisis against a joint adversary; our findings are
robust to this specification.

Every nuclear state except South Africa appears in our dataset. South
Africa is omitted only because, according to the ICB data, it does not
experience any crises with other nuclear states during the years in
which it possesses nuclear weapons. Data on the approximate sizes of
states' nuclear arsenals are from Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S.
Norris.30 The ICB data codes a victory if a state achieves its goals;
since not all goals are mutually exclusive, crises can have multiple or
no winners. We categorize data according to the level of arsenal
disparity within a dyad.

Table 1 depicts all crises in our dataset. The first column presents the
crisis dyad, with the superior state listed first. The second column
records the ratio between the nuclear arsenals of the states. The third
column presents an approximation of the stakes experienced by the
inferior state in the dyad. We use two datasets for this coding. The
first is the ICB dataset, which codes crises in terms of their gravity.
We code threats that are political, territorial, threats of grave
damage, and threats to existence as high stakes. We consider threats to
influence, economic threats, and limited military threats as low-stakes
issues.31 We also use the MCT dataset, which contains a subset of the
ICB cases where compellence was used.32 The MCT dataset notes whether
the compellent threat at the core of the crisis was about a political or
territorial issue, which we consider high stakes, or whether the crisis
was about lower-stakes issues. The table also lists crisis outcomes.33

As our theory predicts, asymmetrically inferior states often have high
stakes and prevent their superior opponents from achieving victory. If
we consider asymmetric superiority to require an arsenal fifty times
larger than the inferior state, then every time an inferior state in an
asymmetric crisis dyad had high stakes, the superior state failed to
achieve its goals. Moreover, the inferior state had high stakes in all
but one asymmetric crisis.34

[[We find]{.mark} that asymmetrically [inferior states are more likely
to win]{.mark} a crisis [than]{.mark} asymmetrically [superior
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Asymmetrically superior states are more
likely to lose than to win. They typically end up in stalemates, draws,
and compromises. [[Nuclear superiority]{.mark} appears to [provide no
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline} as the degree of superiority gets very
large. We find that states with asymmetric nuclear superiority over
their opponents fail to achieve their crisis objectives more often than
they accomplish them.

[[This contradicts]{.underline}]{.mark} both the predictions of
[scholars who argue nuclear superiority provides strategic
advantages]{.underline}---as they would expect superiority to be more
helpful as the disparity in arsenal sizes increases35 \[\[FN 35\]\] 35
[[Kroenig]{.mark}, "Nuclear Superiority and the Balance of
Resolve"]{.underline}; Kroenig, Logic of American Nuclear Strategy;
Early and Asal, "Nuclear Weapons and Existential Threats." \[\[END FN
35\]\]---and the predictions of those who argue nuclear superiority is
insignificant36---as they would not expect nuclear superiority to have a
positive correlation with victory in crises at low levels of arsenal
size disparity. The findings also directly contradict Bell and
Macdonald,37 who anticipate superiority to provide more of an advantage
in asymmetric crises than symmetric crises.38 Instead, we find
asymmetrically inferior states are able to deter opponents in
high-stakes crises.

If we relax our conception of asymmetry to require only a nuclear ratio
of 30:1, we still find that asymmetrically inferior states with high
stakes successfully prevent a superior victory in all cases, and we find
that inferior states have high stakes in three-fourths of crises. In
addition, when asymmetrically inferior states have low stakes, their
crisis involvement can be explained by alliances. [[We can]{.mark}
further [relax our]{.mark} definition of [asymmetry]{.mark} to [require
a]{.mark} much [smaller]{.mark} nuclear [ratio]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as 5:1, 3:1, or 2:1, [[and]{.mark} we [still find]{.mark} that [in
at least half of all cases]{.mark}]{.underline}, the inferior state has
high stakes, and [the [superior state does not
succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}.39

Our argument also has implications for the frequency of asymmetric and
symmetric crises. Because asymmetric crises should tend to involve
high-stakes issues, concessions by asymmetric states should be rare.
Instead, asymmetrically inferior states will choose to escalate to
prevent their opponents from achieving their objectives. Due to
asymmetric states' unwillingness to concede, we should also find that
crises more often occur among asymmetric than symmetric dyads. Indeed,
23/29, or 80%, of crisis dyads are asymmetric if we use a threshold of
2:1. If instead we use a threshold of 3:1, then 20/29, or 69%, of crisis
dyads are asymmetric. If we use a threshold of 5:1, then 17/29, or 58%,
of crisis dyads are asymmetric. Finally, in more than half of all crisis
dyads (15/29), the superior state has at least nine times as many
nuclear weapons as its opponent.

Quantitative Analyses

Using the ICB data, we analyze the effect of superiority on the
probability of victory in crises. The unit of analysis is the
crisis-directed dyad, and there are 58 observations. The outcome
variable in each observation identifies whether "State A" achieved
victory. Winning a crisis is determined by whether a state achieves its
objectives, and there are many conditions--- draws, stalemates, or
compromises---that can cause crises to end without a victor.
Additionally, crises are not zero-sum; it is possible for both states to
emerge victorious. We test the effect of nuclear superiority on victory,
meaning we are comparing victory to cases in which both states lose, as
well as cases in which the inferior state wins. This accurately reflects
our theory. We predict asymmetrically inferior states will gain a
deterrent advantage, not a compellent advantage, meaning that they are
more likely to win or draw.40 Though previous quantitative work on
nuclear crises ends in 2001,41 ICB has since been extended. This allows
us to include more cases. We add three nuclear crises that occurred
between 2001 and 2010: the 2002 Kaluchak terrorist attack, the 2006
North Korean nuclear test, and the 2009 North Korean satellite launch.42

Previous scholarship has investigated the effects of symmetry and
asymmetry using a continuous measure of the nuclear ratio as the
independent variable. Though advocates of nuclear superiority would
suspect that, as the ratio increases, the likelihood of victory should
also increase, we perform a series of robustness checks that reveal the
nuclear ratio does not have a consistent effect on crisis outcomes or
militarized interstate dispute outcomes.43 However, our theory, and the
descriptive statistics presented in the previous section, suggest that
using the nuclear ratio to assess the relationship between superiority
and victory may yield an inaccurate picture, as symmetric and asymmetric
crises should instead be considered separately.

Table 1 suggests states with (1) vastly inferior nuclear arsenals tend
to win crises or end up in draws (88% of the time);44 (2) somewhat
inferior nuclear arsenals tend to lose crises (90% of the time); (3)
somewhat superior nuclear arsenals tend to win crises (57% of the time);
and (4) vastly superior nuclear arsenals tend to lose crises or end up
in draws (88% of the time). This pattern suggests the relationship
between the nuclear ratio and victory is non-linear. At the lowest
levels of the ratio, such as 1:4,000 or 1:1,000, the probability of
victory will be high, but this probability will decline as the ratio
approaches 1:1. As the ratio grows, the probability of victory will
increase, before falling again as the ratio gets higher. Thus,
accurately identifying the relationship between the nuclear ratio and
victory with a linear model---as previous studies have done---would be
inappropriate. The inconsistent results of Online Appendix H, which uses
the ratio measurement across multiple model specifications, illustrates
some of the shortcomings of this approach to studying superiority.

Therefore, we create a dichotomous measure that captures changes in the
degree of superiority a state has over its opponent. This measure places
each directed-dyad-year observation into one of three categories:
asymmetric superiority of State A, rough symmetry of State A and State
B, and asymmetric inferiority of State A. This measure facilitates a
comparison of the probability of victory given asymmetric nuclear
superiority versus the probability of victory given asymmetric
inferiority, as well as the probability of victory given symmetry versus
the probability of victory given asymmetry. In fact, using this measure,
we find states with vast asymmetric superiority are no more likely to
achieve victory than vastly inferior states. That is, having far more
nuclear weapons than one's opponent does not provide an advantage during
crises.

Specifically, we construct a separate binary indicator of superiority
for each nuclear ratio threshold, thus changing the number of
observations that are coded as asymmetrically superior. At each
threshold, within a given dyad, one state can be coded as asymmetrically
superior and the other as asymmetrically inferior, or both states can be
coded as having nuclear symmetry with their opponent. When two opponents
possess arsenals roughly equivalent at a particular threshold, we
consider their arsenals symmetrical. To illustrate, consider an
asymmetric superiority threshold of 1.5, where a state with more than
1.5 times as many nuclear weapons as its opponent is coded as
asymmetrically superior. The other state will be coded as asymmetrically
inferior. During the Yom Kippur War, for example, the United States
possessed an arsenal that was about 1.78 times the size of the Soviet
Union's arsenal. For the US-USSR dyad in the Yom Kippur War, the United
States is asymmetrically superior at the 1.5 threshold and the Soviet
Union is asymmetrically inferior. When the threshold is changed to 2,
however, both states are coded as symmetric. To test our argument, we
need to identify the effects of nuclear superiority at various
definitions of what makes a crisis asymmetric. Although we purport that
asymmetry requires a high threshold, we test all possible definitions of
asymmetry to validate this claim.45

High thresholds bias against the empirical implications of our theory
and reflect situations in which inferior states can neither leverage
reciprocal repercussions nor hope to seriously harm their adversaries'
ability to retaliate against a nuclear first strike. Our measurement
strategy circumvents issues associated with the use of simple arsenal
size to operationalize nuclear superiority. When arsenals are similarly
sized, components such as targeting, delivery methods, and nuclear
strategy can affect which state has the more capable nuclear arsenal.
These elements are less important, however, when the superior state has
many times more nuclear weapons than the inferior state.

For each new, distinct coding of asymmetric superiority, we use a logit
model with cluster robust standard errors46 to estimate the effect of
asymmetric superiority compared to asymmetric inferiority on crisis
outcomes. We use a logit model since the outcome variable is a binary
measure of whether State A in the dyad achieved its goals in the crisis.
We control for symmetry in each of the models, so that asymmetric
inferiority is the reference category. In other words, the test
estimates the effect of asymmetric nuclear superiority on the likelihood
State A achieves its goals, compared to if State A was asymmetrically
inferior. In all models, we control for proximity,47 regime type,48
material capabilities,49 population size,50 the level of violence in the
crisis,51 and security.52 We also control for second-strike capability,
measured by whether a state possesses submarine-launched ballistic
missiles, mobile missiles, or nuclear-armed aircraft on continuous
airborne alert.53 Following Kroenig's approach,54 we control for these
factors because they may mediate or confound the effect of nuclear
superiority on a state's probability of victory in a crisis. Our results
are robust to the exclusion of these controls.

\[\[FN 53\]\]

53 [We define second-strike capability in the same way as Kroenig for
comparability]{.underline}. See Kroenig, "Nuclear Superiority and the
Balance of Resolve," 157. We include all states with nuclear-capable
submarines, but this may overstate when the Soviet Union acquired a
secure second-strike capability, because early Soviet nuclear submarines
were likely insufficient. However, this approach biases against our
theory, which expects second-strike capability will be positively
associated with the likelihood of victory, meaning even small arsenals
can deter

\[\[END FN 53\]\]

Note that we do not control for stakes, since we expect this to be
endogenous to the nuclear balance.55 We posit that having high stakes
results from asymmetric nuclear inferiority and that asymmetrically
inferior states are able to credibly signal resolve because of high
stakes. Our theory therefore suggests stakes to be a posttreatment
variable, and including this variable in the model would therefore
produce bias.56 Furthermore, we cannot directly test the interaction of
asymmetric inferiority and high stakes because there is no meaningful
variation. In all cases in our data, with the exception of France in the
Berlin Wall Crisis, asymmetrically inferior states have high stakes, as
our theory would predict.

\[\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]\]

[Main Results]{.underline}

The results, displayed in a regression table in Online Appendix L,57 and
visualized more clearly in Figure 1, suggest nuclear superiority has a
positive, significant effect on the probability of victory when the
threshold is set at 1 or a little above 1.5. However, when the threshold
increases, the significant effect mostly disappears. This means that
when the superior state in a crisis has a nuclear arsenal slightly
larger than the inferior state's arsenal, the superior state tends to
win. However, when the superior state has an arsenal any more than 1.65
times as large as the inferior state's arsenal, the superior state is no
longer more likely to win. At even higher thresholds, [nuclear
[superiority]{.mark} generally [does not provide]{.mark} a
[meaningful]{.mark} strategic [advantage]{.mark} and may even be a
disadvantage]{.underline}. The relationship between asymmetric
superiority and victory becomes negative when the threshold is more than
20 times the size of the opponent's arsenal. This negative relationship
is significant when asymmetric superiority is defined as having at least
28 times as many nuclear weapons as an opponent. These findings evidence
our theory.

[Interestingly]{.underline}, the regression tables in Online Appendix L
reveal that [the [effect of conventional]{.mark} military [capabilities
is positive and significant]{.mark}]{.underline} in models where
asymmetric superiority is coded at a threshold of 3 or above.
[[Conventional superiority]{.mark} appears to [matter more]{.mark} as
nuclear superiority matters less. Proximity [and second-strike]{.mark}
capability [always have a positive]{.mark}, significant
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas security always has a negative,
significant effect. Violence has a positive, significant effect in all
but two of the models.58 Regime type is positive and significant, and
population is negative and significant in a few models, but there is no
consistent pattern between the threshold and whether these variables are
significant.

#### The likely explanation for this is Kroenig faked a bunch of models\-\--nuclear deterrence causes diminishing returns AND conventional outweighs.

The United States and Nuclear Deterrence After the Cold War, Oxford
University Press, Online Ed.)

The Deficient Quantitative Case for Superiority

The case for superiority cannot rely solely on mathematical reasoning,
even when analysts imply that numbers speak for themselves. Some
analysts maintained, for instance, that [US preponderance in available
measures of conventional capability rendered moot questions about US
global preeminence (unipolar status)]{.underline} in the early
post--Cold War period (see Wohlforth 1999). Still, depending on simple
math to solve conceptual problems is a double-edged sword. If our vague
sense tells us that superiority is a relative concept, we must also
concede that superiority decreases rapidly once nuclear aspirants
acquire but a small nuclear arsenal.

Figure 3.1 demonstrates this, with basic arithmetic. In the figure, the
x-axis indicates the number of warheads possessed by the inferior party,
the y-axis indicates the ratio of superiority held by the superior over
the inferior party, and the lines display these ratios for a superior
party at given force sizes (50, 100, 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 warheads).
Clear from the figure is that, [regardless of the [superior]{.mark}
party's [holdings]{.mark}, its relative [advantage drops]{.mark}
dramatically [by the time]{.mark} an [adversary acquires]{.mark} but
five [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the bigger the superior
party's arsenal, the more dramatic the relative decline]{.underline}.
The point is not that these advantages are insignificant politically or
militarily. The point is that if advocates recognize benefits in the
magnitude of relative [[superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}, they must also
concede that these [[benefits collapse once]{.mark} an [adversary
accumulates]{.mark} a modest]{.underline} (absolute) [store in [nuclear
weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}. For that matter, they must concede that
the fact, itself, of a quick collapse in the relative advantage of the
superior party might also confer a bargaining advantage.

Arms-control experts have always drawn attention to the instability
challenge when contenders possess small nuclear arsenals---say, one
warhead each. By unilaterally adding one, two, or three warheads to its
arsenal, a party could double, triple, and quadruple its advantage
relative to the opponent. Under these conditions--- when a breakout from
an arms-control agreement can give a state a quick and arguably decisive
advantage---states are disinclined to observe such agreements, let alone
negotiate them in the first place.9 Yet the challenge, here, is from the
smaller nuclear arsenal. If ratios of advantage count for bargaining
purposes, we must recognize that, [even with a large arsenal, [states
are vulnerable to challenges]{.mark} at the low end [from "inferior"
states]{.mark} choosing to [build up their
holdings]{.mark}]{.underline}.

height="3.8439895013123357in"}

Of course, one way around inconclusive mathematics is to show that
[these ratios of nuclear advantage have real-world impact]{.underline}.
Accordingly, analysts ask whether superiority, as defined, translates
into "winning percentages." They are not wrong to do this. That
superiority, as defined, predicts international outcomes is a potential
source of definitional validation. Yet, we must accept all such
validation with extreme caution. For one thing, predictive capability
constitutes a weak form of validation. It rests on circular logic:
researchers affirm a hypothesis, based on questionable measures, and
then use the same (thereby questionable) hypothesis test to validate the
measures.10 Tautological logic aside, validation depends on a viable
model, in all respects: specification, concept operationalization, and
case selection.

On these grounds, [[Kroenig's]{.mark} quantitative [models prove
deficient]{.mark}]{.underline}. In predicting historical conflict
outcomes, with measures of US nuclear superiority, [he [inadequately
controls for]{.mark} the impact of potential [influences]{.mark}. Most
problematically, Kroenig measures a country's [conventional]{.mark}
capabilities using]{.underline} standard Composite Index of National
Capability [[(CINC) scores]{.mark}, which combine]{.underline} a
country's global share of [steel production, energy]{.underline}
consumption, [troop levels, population, and military
expenditures]{.underline} in a single index. Analysts routinely employ
the CINC measure in quantitative analyses. See also Beardsley and Asal
(2009). Still, [the measure's components]{.underline} (individually and
collectively) [[tell us little about]{.mark} a country's [ability to
project]{.mark} power, [win battles, apply]{.mark} necessary [force, and
persevere]{.mark}, if necessary, with [adversity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Take [[the Cuban]{.mark} Missile [Crisis, for
instance]{.mark}]{.underline}. To make a compelling case that nuclear
advantages explain the crisis outcome, we must convincingly account for
the expected outcome of a possible conventional military showdown in the
Caribbean---and perhaps even a showdown in Berlin, if the Soviets staged
a retaliatory attack in a more favorable venue. Yes, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [held]{.mark} an "[advantage]{.mark}"
[in]{.mark} deliverable [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Cuban
Missile Crisis. [[But]{.mark} the United States [also]{.mark} held a
significant advantage [in]{.mark} a potential [conventional
contest]{.mark} anywhere in the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}. That
the conventional capability measure is statistically insignificant in
Beardsley and Asal (2009), for instance, is telling. Why should we buy
their conclusion that superior nuclear capabilities influence crisis
outcomes when they fail to show that conventional capabilities matter?
Does it mean that countries that can build nuclear weapons should not
waste resources on conventional armies?

Kroenig recognizes, to be fair, that the "resolve" of the parties could
affect outcomes. As we shall see (in Chapter 6), the term invites
analytical problems of its own. Kroenig hardly addresses (much less
remedies) these deficiencies, however, when he reduces the resoluteness
of the parties to their relative physical distance from the location of
the conflict. Why should geographical proximity matter in a
nuclear-armed world in which states can eviscerate one another, in a
matter of minutes, regardless of where they are located? Then, why, in
evaluating the stakes, should we privilege geography over topography,
demography, political alignment, economic development, military basing
rights, and various other factors that play into a country's strategic
calculations?

Ultimately, [we should recognize the [models]{.mark} offered [by
Kroenig]{.mark}]{.underline}, and others, [for what they [are: stylized
depictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. These models conform to the strictures
of the data, disciplinary conventions, and requirements of statistical
analysis and can thus disclose relationships between standard indicators
and crisis outcomes. Yet, as currently constructed, [they provide few
clues to how nuclear superiority, conventional capabilities, resolve,
and other factors]{.underline} (singularly or jointly) [affect
outcomes]{.underline}. Indeed, the crisis data set used in Kroenig's
analysis treats crises as single temporal units, such that a party's
resolve and capabilities remain constant throughout individual crises.

Nonproliferation Review, University of Kansas Libraries, Taylor and
Francis) \*Four cases: Cuban Missile Crisis, '69 China-Soviet Border
Dispute, '99 Kargil War, '73 Middle East War

The four cases also challenge another key claim of The Logic of American
Nuclear Strategy. Based on the analysis in Chapter 5, [[Kroenig
claims]{.mark} that nuclear-[superior states have]{.mark} a [perfect
record]{.mark} of being able [to deter]{.mark} nuclear-inferior
states]{.underline} from making compellence challenges. [[But in]{.mark}
all four of the [most severe crises, the inferior state
initiated]{.mark} the crisis]{.underline}.17 [It seems [these]{.mark}
four cases [were not considered]{.mark} militarized compellent [threats
by the]{.mark} coding [rules of the]{.mark} MCT [dataset. But they are
clearly failures of deterrence]{.mark} for the state that had the larger
nuclear arsenal in each instance. These [cases show]{.mark} that nuclear
[superiority is no guarantee against]{.mark} an inferior rival acting
provocatively or even initiating armed [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In fact, nuclear weapons do not always prevent aggression, even by
non-nuclear adversaries. Although Kroenig focuses on the US-Soviet
dimension of the 1973 war, the war began when Egypt and Syria attacked
Israel, a state that was widely known by that date to have a nuclear
capability. Even if nuclear superiority has benefits, it does not
prevent weaker states from sometimes challenging important commitments.

Even more crucially, in some situations, one side's [nuclear
[superiority may]{.mark} actually [make a crisis]{.mark} more
[likely]{.mark}. The [Cuban]{.mark} Missile [Crisis
was]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a way, [[provoked by]{.mark} US nuclear
superiority. In the late 1950s]{.underline}, many in the United States,
including presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, spoke of a "missile
gap" that favored the Soviets. But especially after the development of
reconnaissance satellites, US intelligence made it clear that the
reverse was true: [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates enjoyed a huge
[advantage in]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental
[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.18 When it
became clear to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that the Kennedy
administration recognized the US advantage and was nevertheless still
adding more weapons, including Jupiter missiles in Turkey near the
Soviet border, [the [Soviets]{.mark} came to [fear]{.mark} that they
could be vulnerable to [a US first strike]{.mark}. The decision [to
place missiles in Cuba was]{.mark} in part [an]{.mark} urgent [effort to
rectify the]{.mark} nuclear [imbalance]{.mark}]{.underline}.19 [[Had
the]{.mark} two [sides been closer]{.mark} to parity, the Soviets would
have had much less incentive to place missiles in Cuba and the most
dangerous [crisis]{.mark} of the nuclear age [could have been
avoided]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, [the pursuit of strategic
superiority carries potential risks]{.underline} as well as potential
benefits.

threats [just 20 percent]{.mark} of the time]{.underline}, while

(temporarily, in 1997). In all of these cases, the United States
possessed a diverse nuclear arsenal and nuclear superiority over its
opponent. Yet most of these threats were unsuccessful.

A recent article by Matthew [[Kroenig]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the same
issue of International Organization, [appears to [challenge our
findings]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kroenig argues that nuclear weapons do
convey advantages in crisis bargaining, but only when a state has
nuclear superiority -- that is, when it has more nuclear weapons than
its opponent. After analyzing 20 crises, he reports "a powerful
relationship between nuclear superiority and victory in nuclear crises"
(p. 143).  Our study of 200 threats, by contrast, found no such
relationship.

[A closer look at Kroenig's evidence, [however]{.mark}, reveals that it
is actually quite supportive of our argument]{.underline}. First,
according to the International Crisis Behavior project, [[the]{.mark}
nuclear-[superior side]{.mark} actually ["won" just 10 of]{.mark} the
[20 crises]{.mark} that [Kroenig evaluates]{.mark}]{.underline}, losing
or settling for a stalemate in the other 10.  (See the table below.)  In
other words, [[the effect]{.mark} of nuclear superiority basically
[amounts to a coin flip]{.mark}]{.underline}: on average, the side with
nuclear superiority fares about as well as the side without it.

#### 2. DMINISHING RETURNS\-\--inferior states will use ASATs, cyber, and singular warheads to deter US strikes. 

**Lebovic 23**, Professor of Political Science and International
Affairs, George Washington University (James Lebovic, 2023, "3. Nuclear
"Superiority" after the Cold War," in The False Promise of Superiority:
The United States and Nuclear Deterrence After the Cold War, Oxford
University Press, Online Ed.)

Kroenig's Case for Superiority

[[Kroenig makes]{.mark} his [case for]{.mark} US nuclear ["superiority"
with little]{.mark}]{.underline} deference to Cold War--era debates. His
"superiority" is insensitive to [[considerations of force deployment,
targeting]{.mark}, advance warning, command and control, pain
[acceptance, and so forth]{.mark}]{.underline}. It relies, instead, on
simple math---which, as it turns out, is also simplistic. That is, it
begs more questions than it answers. Should we assume that a superior
party simply has more weapons than a competitor? In other words, do we
set the threshold for superiority at the level of the opponent's
capability? By this standard, we must recognize, then, that a
one-warhead advantage counts the same as a thousand-warhead advantage.
Alternatively, should we assume that some ratio of advantage constitutes
superiority over an opponent? If so, why two rather than three or four
times the opponent's capability? Then, can we ignore force sizes
entirely? After all, possessing two nuclear weapons when an adversary
has one weapon is a potentially useful advantage; possessing
two-thousand additional weapons when an adversary possesses one-thousand
nuclear weapons might not constitute an "advantage."

Convenient arithmetic becomes the fallback, then, to avoid difficult
questions. What do [[we miss]{.mark}, for instance]{.underline}, when we
assume a competition limited to warheads in the opposing arsenals? After
all, nuclear advantages emerge from factors other than types and numbers
of nuclear weapons. Precision-guided [[conventional weapons can]{.mark}
now [threaten]{.mark} land-based [strategic]{.mark} nuclear
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline} or other targets once vulnerable only to
nuclear weapons; in turn, [[a]{.mark}nti-[sat]{.mark}ellite weapons [and
cyber]{.mark} weapons can [threaten]{.mark} the [c]{.mark}ommand
a[n]{.mark}d [c]{.mark}ontrol of nuclear forces]{.underline} (Koblentz
2014). Even if we were to assume a conflict confined exclusively to a
nuclear battlefield, the remaining questions challenge the analytical
reliance on simplistic ratios. Can the damage inflicted by any one side
limit the damage that the targeted party can inflict in return? How much
damage would a party need to inflict, then, in retaliation for an attack
to deter an adversary from using its nuclear weapons?1 In more specific
terms, saying that a party can land two or three blows for every blow it
receives, or can land two or three blows more than the opponent can,
makes no allowance for pain tolerance. Can we say with confidence, for
instance, that a government would willingly accept any nuclear
destruction on its home turf, even if it wins the battle of "blows
landed"?

Without the specification of threshold values, based on discernable and
meaningful criteria---backed by viable absolute or relative
logic---[[superiority remains]{.mark} a [nebulous]{.mark} principle that
cannot yield operational standards]{.underline}. Superiority refers only
to some unknown point on an absolute or relative continuum at which the
balance shifts, slightly or decidedly, toward one of two parties.

Conceptual frailties do not stop analysts from tying superiority to
various concepts and numerical standards. For Kroenig, various
relativist terms are synonymous with superiority. These include a
"favorable nuclear balance of power" and "military nuclear advantages."
To give operational meaning to these concepts, he references a "state's
expected cost of nuclear war," which he defines metaphorically (Kroenig
2018: 3--4). He assumes that, when a big and a small car race toward
each other, the driver of the big car obtains the coercive advantage. It
will likely win this game of "brinkmanship" because the driver of the
small car has the most to lose in a crash. Simply put, size differences
matter---whether measured absolutely or relatively.

Probing this vividly deceptive metaphor highlights the numerous
conceptual and operational deficiencies in Kroenig's thinking about
superiority. First, should we assume that the two drivers will accept
even some damage? The example ignores the absolute value the drivers
place on their bodies and vehicles. Under what circumstances would most
drivers willingly accept a broken arm or leg? For that matter, a door
scratch, for some drivers, is a burden too hard to bear; other drivers
might take comfort knowing they left their "nice car" at home. Second,
should we assume that the two drivers will evaluate the damage in
relative terms? More directly, under what extreme circumstances would a
driver willingly accept bodily damage knowing the driver of the other
car will suffer more? Third, should we assume that the cars are
otherwise unoccupied? If we do, we implicitly embrace the extreme views
of Cold War--era warfighters that adversary leaders put their own
lives---and the cause of government---above all else, including family
or society. If we assume, instead, that the cars carry passengers, whose
lives the driver values, does the driver of the large car obtain a
coercive advantage knowing that, at most, a collision will kill one or
two passengers in the large car but three, maybe four, passengers in the
smaller car? Fourth, should we suppose that the drivers know, with
certainty, the outcome of the crash? The results of collision tests on
vehicles vary depending on speed but also the angle and point of impact.
Some car drivers "miraculously" escape horrific crashes with
eighteen-wheel vehicles; other car drivers die in collisions with
motorcycles, even deer or farm animals. In these crashes, size was not
the determining factor. On this point, note that automakers engineer
cars---of all sizes--- for greater safety (with airbags, seat
restraints, metal reinforcement, and fuel-tank relocation). Conversely,
people could redesign their cars for increased lethality (as we learned
from the Mad Max movie franchise), with battering rams, tire shredders,
and the like. Thus, once probing Kroenig's vague definition---through
his compelling metaphor---we cannot know a priori which of the two
drivers necessarily holds the advantage.

Of course, Kroenig (2018: 7) maintains only that the bigger-car driver
will accept a higher "risk" of damage, not the deadly consequences of a
head-on collision. His logic here seemingly allows him to escape the
implication that [a [nuclear exchange is anything but costly to
all]{.mark} parties. But a willingness [to incur risk]{.mark}, here,
[is]{.mark} but [a sleight of hand]{.mark}, for [Kroenig
requires]{.mark}, nonetheless, that [we accept]{.mark} that relative
[damage in]{.mark} a nuclear [war determines]{.mark} the relative
[acceptance of risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. He insists bigger-car drivers
will win any battle of nerves ("resolve") because they presumably will
"win" any resulting battle of actual cost. If both "drivers" regard a
collision as catastrophic (and thus cost prohibitive), however, the
bigger-car driver is no more inclined than the small-car driver to
accept risk.

To his credit, Kroenig (2018: 25) recognizes that the risk acceptance of
the parties also depends on their payoffs---the gains from a
confrontation, not just the relative costs.2 But he must also
acknowledge, then, that considering payoffs further undercuts his
argument. If the driver of the small car seeks vengeance, would that not
swamp relative-cost considerations in assessments of risk propensities?
The answer: maybe, maybe not. An answer, in the abstract, is impossible.
We cannot know whether payoffs exceed costs, whether costs predict risk
acceptance, or much else that Kroenig accepts, by assumption, without
reference to case specifics. Here as elsewhere, specious arguments
survive because the terms of reference remain remote from view, and
immune from scrutiny.

For that matter, specious arguments survive through redirection. Despite
the allusions to cost, risk acceptance, and payoffs, [Kroenig's
operational definition of superiority ultimately rests on an arbitrary
threshold value]{.underline}. Kroenig (2013) supposes that a party
acquires superiority when it possesses one nuclear warhead more than an
opponent. Should we assume that a leader---with a one-warhead
advantage---who anticipates the arrival of three-hundred enemy warheads
sees the dangers in quite the same way as a leader anticipating the
arrival of three enemy warheads? If we do, perhaps that undercuts the
argument that superiority matters. Conversely, [[why]{.mark} should we
[assume leaders would]{.mark} knowingly [accept any]{.mark} nuclear
[damage?]{.mark} Maybe, [one warhead]{.mark} landing on national turf
[is one]{.mark}-warhead [too many]{.mark}. Kroenig (2018: 17) seems to
concede that point: "Even a single warhead detonated in the United
States would be a tragedy of historic proportions."]{.underline} We
should remember that US policymakers implied, at least, that an attack
of any proportion was cost prohibitive when warning of the dangers of an
Iraqi nuclear weapon before the 2003 US invasion of that country. In
September 2002, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice memorably
pronounced, in her challenge to skeptics, that the "smoking gun"
evidence they sought (concerning Iraq's WMD holdings) might appear, too
late, as a "mushroom cloud." That was one cloud---presumably, one cloud
too many. President Obama publicly channeled that sentiment at a United
Nations Security Council summit on nuclear weapons. In his words, "Just
one nuclear weapon exploded in a city---be it New York or Moscow; Tokyo
or Beijing; London or Paris---could kill hundreds of thousands of
people. And it would badly destabilize our security, our economies, and
our very way of life."3

#### 1. [TECHNICAL SYSTEMS]{.underline}. Even [intel-gathering]{.underline} technologies [negate strategic stability]{.underline}. 

**Zala 19**, Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow in the Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School (Benjamin
Zala, January 25, 2019, "Missile Defense Review makes US less safe," The
Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/426392-missile-defense-review-makes-us-less-safe/)

This was never a serious argument. [[Of course]{.mark} the
[initial]{.mark}]{.underline} deployments of interceptors and [[radars
would be limited]{.underline}]{.mark}; this is new and expensive
technology. [[But, bit by bit, the system]{.mark} has
[expanded]{.mark}]{.underline} and improved.

[The [Russians]{.mark}]{.underline} and the Chinese [[were not concerned
about what was deployed today; rather,]{.mark} it was [what]{.mark}
these [moves signaled about]{.mark} what]{.underline} eventually [would
be deployed in [the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor were they
necessarily concerned about U.S. intentions today. Foreign policy
outlooks and intentions can change --- look at the shift from presidents
Obama to Trump. Therefore, [it is the capabilities of tomorrow that
matter]{.underline}, not the intentions of today. 

But Americans should be concerned about the missile defenses being
deployed today. [This [seemingly innocuous]{.mark} system of [radars,
tracking tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [and interceptors [undermines
stability]{.mark} in]{.underline} Washington's [strategic relations
[with Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} and Beijing. [[Defending against
attack flies in the face of]{.underline}]{.mark} the idea of
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}utually-[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}ssured
[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}estruction, the idea reluctantly embraced during
the Cold War (and after), to lower the risks of nuclear first strikes.
Both sides being equally vulnerable to nuclear retaliation, means that
neither has incentive to strike first. Developing missile defenses, by
definition, means abandoning the concept of mutual vulnerability. But
this has been glossed over too easily in debates over the issue.

#### Even [limited intel systems]{.underline} threaten foreign [nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. 

**Grego 19**, Senior Scientist, Global Security Program at the Union of
Concerned Scientists (Laura Grego, March 2019, "Mixed Messages on
Missile Defense," in Assessing the 2019 Missile Defense Review, Arms
Control Today, University of Kansas Libraries, JSTOR)

As these investments continue, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and China
[[fear]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[may one day believe it has a]{.mark}
credible [first-strike capability]{.mark}]{.underline}; this is an
incentive to improve and diversify their nuclear delivery systems.
Indeed, the Chinese and Russian development of systems designed to
overcome ballistic missile defenses, such as multiple independently
targetable re-entry vehicles and hypersonic and cruise missiles, are
presented in the report as novel threats rather than steps taken to
hedge against a U.S. missile defense system that has not been
constrained since the 2002 U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty. This action-reaction cycle is the very dynamic the
1972 ABM Treaty was designed to prevent. Indeed, without any intervening
arms control, a cyclical, costly, and dangerous buildup of offense and
defense seems all but guaranteed.

This review amplifies the issue with its very deliberate integration of
offensive and defensive strategies. The report proposes bringing attack
operations into the overall missile defense posture as a triad along
with active defenses, such as interceptors, and passive defenses, such
as hardening and dispersal of potential missile targets. These attack
operations, essentially a kinetic version of "left of launch," are a
pre-emptive strategy of targeting potentially mobile missiles before an
adversary's first attack.

Although the report's discussion of preemptive attack centers on rogue
states, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and China [[will find it difficult
to ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} the elevation of this strategy,
particularly as [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [spends
more on]{.underline} overhead [[sensors designed to provide]{.mark}
constant [coverage]{.mark}]{.underline} and long-range conventional
prompt global-strike capabilities, including hypersonic missiles,
[[that]{.mark} could [hold strategic targets at risk. This]{.mark}
begins to [look]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[like a]{.mark} strategy
supporting a]{.underline} disarming [[first strike rather than]{.mark} a
[deterrence]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}. Indeed, the first Russian
statement on the review cited this exact concern.7

The renewed interest in space-based missile defense is likely to worsen
these concerns. The report suggests that a space-based interceptor layer
could "increase the overall likelihood of successfully intercepting
offensive missiles \[and\] reduce the number of U.S. defensive
interceptors required to do so."

Space-based missile defense has not been a Pentagon favorite and has not
appeared in a budget request for a decade. Expert advice has
consistently warned that such a system would be exorbitantly expensive.
A 2012 National Research Council study concluded that an "austere"
space-based defense to defeat a few North Korean missiles would require
more than 650 satellites and cost more than \$300 billion.8

That expense is likely to be prohibitive, but is not the greatest
challenge. Space-based missile defenses, whether interceptors or lasers,
are vulnerable to being overwhelmed by salvo missile launch or disabled
by anti-satellite weapons, rendering the system ineffective.
Space-basing would allow U.S. interceptors to get close to a launching
missile, but putting assets in space makes them particularly susceptible
to attack. It is difficult to imagine such a system could be constructed
in full without it being challenged politically by opponents to space
weaponization and militarily by adversaries.

The review-mandated "examination" of space-based missile defense
concepts may include on-orbit experiments. This would be extremely
problematic because [[even]{.mark} a [small number of interceptors
in]{.mark} the [guise of research]{.mark} and development [would be
destabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Putting weapons in space would cross
a line that has held firm for more than 60 years [and make much more
difficult any prospect for limits on]{.underline} space weapons and
anti-satellite [weapons necessary to underpin a secure]{.underline} and
sustainable space [environment]{.underline} into the future.

#### 2. [OPEN-ENDEDNESS]{.underline}. The potential to [turn existing systems]{.underline} into [future BMD]{.underline} undermines strategic stability. Destroying them is the only way to put the genie back in the bottle. 

**Starchak 22**, Fellow, Queens University Canada (Maxim Starchak, April
2022, "Strategic Parity: Why "American" Arms Control Is Not Interested
In Russia," George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies,
https://www.marshallcenter.org/sites/default/files/files/2022-04/SI72_Strategic_Parity_Starchak1%2020APR.pdf)

However, transparency of the U.S. missile defense system does not solve
the missile defense problem for Moscow. This could only confirm that
U.S. missile defense systems will not carry Tomahawk strike missiles.
And that is only part of the problem. [The [impact of missile defense
on]{.mark} strategic [parity]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russian politics
[[is permanent]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [military [doctrine
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n Federation
[[declares]{.mark} that the [creation]{.mark}]{.underline} and
deployment [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic [[missile defense]{.mark}
systems disrupting global stability]{.underline} and existing balance of
forces in the nuclear missile sphere [[is a major]{.mark} external
military [threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 2007, Vladimir Putin declared that deployment of the U.S. missile
defense system in Europe can be compared to deployment of Pershing
missiles in Europe in the early 1980s. The threat is absolutely the
same, and the U.S. missile defense units deployed in Europe are an
integral part of the U.S. strategic nuclear weapons.54 He repeated it in
2016 55 and in late 2021.56 According to Putin, ballistic missiles are
most vulnerable during launch, and that is why it is better to have the
interceptor as close as possible. In other words, U.S. missile defense
in Europe is an attempt to upset the strategic nuclear balance.57
Therefore, [[even]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} ability of [missile
defense]{.mark} to shoot down ballistic missiles [can reduce]{.mark} or
affect the [nuclear parity]{.mark} between Russia and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

For Russia, it is about the fact that missile defense systems can be
quite effective at protecting the initiator of a strategic nuclear
exchange from a retaliatory strike. The latter strike is carried out by
strategic forces that include naval and land-based ballistic missiles
survived by the first attack. If just a few missiles are left, say a few
dozen, then missile defense systems can at least hypothetically minimize
the damage from retaliatory use of strategic nuclear missiles to an
"acceptable limit." In these circumstances, both sides of a potential
conflict may conclude that in an escalating armed confrontation the most
"rational" strategy, from the purely military point of view, may be to
launch a massive nuclear strike first. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
turn, is a factor that [[destabilizes]{.mark} the strategic [balance and
ruins]{.mark} mutual nuclear [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.58

#### Solves [0%]{.underline} of the [net benefit]{.underline}. It is the [open-ended]{.underline} nature, [not number]{.underline}, of BMD technologies that cause Russian [modernization]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Deterrence\-\--1NC/2NC

#### Double bind: enemies [are rational]{.underline}, and thus [deterrable]{.underline}, then EITHER [retaliation]{.underline} OR the possibility of [overcoming missile defense]{.underline} solves. 

**Butt 10**, Research Professor, James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute for International
Studies (Yousaf Butt, May 8, 2010, "The myth of missile defense as a
deterrent," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2010/05/the-myth-of-missile-defense-as-a-deterrent/)

In other words, [the posture review essentially asserts [that missile
defense can]{.mark} somehow [compensate]{.mark} for [the
deterrent]{.mark} capability]{.underline} that will supposedly be lost
due to reductions in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Setting aside the fact
that there haven't been any realistic tests indicating "major
improvements in missile defenses," [such logic [is questionable]{.mark}
on three levels]{.underline}.

[[First]{.mark}, it's far from clear]{.underline} that the precise
number of deployed [U.S. nuclear weapons affects an adversary's
deterrent calculus]{.underline}--especially when the operational
stockpile will still consist of more than 1,000 weapons. (Even if New
START is ratified and the Russian and U.S. operational warheads are
reduced to about 1,550 each, many thousands of additional weapons will
remain in the reserve stockpiles.) As Jeffrey Lewis has pointed out,
"[[An enemy who can be deterred, will be]{.mark} deterred [by]{.mark}
the prospect of a [counterattack, even if]{.mark} it [consists of only a
few]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}. Beyond that minimum threshold,
nuclear weapons provide little additional deterrent
benefit]{.underline}." Similarly, Col. B. Chance Saltzman, chief of the
air force's Strategic Plans and Policy Division, has argued that "the
United States could address military utility concerns with only 311
nuclear weapons in its nuclear force structure while maintaining a
stable deterrence." So contrary to what the NPR indicates, slightly
reducing the U.S. operational arsenal won't create a "deterrence gap"
that needs to be filled.

[[Second]{.mark}, even if reducing the U.S. stockpile did affect U.S.
deterrent posture, missile defense couldn't replace any lost deterrent
value because [missile defense doesn't deter]{.mark} nuclear
attacks]{.underline}. The purpose of missile defense is to defend--or,
more accurately, attempt to defend. An adversary wouldn't be deterred
from launching a nuclear attack because of the existence of missile
defense; [[rather, it's]{.mark} the [credible]{.mark} threat of
overwhelming nuclear [retaliation that deters]{.mark} an adversary.
[If]{.mark} the [enemy is irrational]{.mark} and suicidal [enough to
discount]{.mark} the threat of massive nuclear [retaliation,
then]{.mark} a [missile defense]{.mark} system [that can]{.mark}
theoretically [intercept only some of]{.mark} the [attacking
missiles]{.mark} most [certainly isn't]{.mark} going to be [a
deterrent]{.mark}. In wonk parlance, [the NPR]{.mark} conveniently
[conflates reprisal]{.mark} deterrence [with denial deterrence.
Reprisal]{.mark} deterrence [is the]{.mark} 800-pound [gorilla, and
denial]{.mark} deterrence [is the flea]{.mark}. If our adversaries are
thinking twice]{.underline} about using nuclear weapons it's because
they're scared of reprisal deterrence. And if they aren't sufficiently
scared of reprisal, fractional denial certainly isn't going to stop
them. To borrow an analogy used by Thomas Schelling, a Nobel laureate
with a deep knowledge of arms control and game theory: Denial deterrence
adds to reprisal deterrence like tying an extra cotton string adds to
the strength of an aircraft carrier's anchor chain.

Third, even if one agrees with the NPR's argument that missile defense
can somehow compensate for the deterrence allegedly lost by reducing the
nuclear arsenal, an enormous logical flaw persists: The two alleged
"deterrents"--the operational stockpile and missile defenses--are aimed
at different countries and aren't interchangeable. Reducing the U.S.
operational nuclear stockpile, which is calibrated to Russia's arsenal,
isn't going to be compensated by investing in missile defenses to
protect against an Iranian attack. Plus, many experts agree that if Iran
obtains nuclear weapons, it wouldn't use them in a suicidal first
strike. A detailed National Defense University study concluded that
Tehran desires nuclear weapons mainly because it feels strategically
isolated and that "possession of such weapons would give the regime
legitimacy, respectability, and protection." Basically, Iran wants a
nuclear capability for deterrence purposes--just like every other
nuclear-armed nation. The Polish foreign minister has even admitted that
Warsaw is involved with U.S. missile defense plans in Europe to improve
diplomatic ties with Washington, not out of any fear of Iranian nuclear
attack.

But if Tehran does obtain nuclear weapons, surrounding it with missile
defenses, no matter how effective, will never eliminate the threat that
a single missile could penetrate the defense system. Thus, the United
States can never neutralize the deterrent value of any possible future
Iranian nuclear ballistic missiles with any incarnation of missile
defense. A nuclear-armed Iran would have to be treated identically by
Washington whether or not missile defenses were in play.

[[The]{.mark} strategic [uselessness]{.mark} of missile
defenses]{.underline} aimed at intercepting nuclear-tipped missiles [[is
clear]{.underline}]{.mark} (as I have argued before). [This is a
conceptual problem, not merely a technical one]{.underline}. The reason
is simple: [[There is always a]{.mark} reasonable
[probability]{.mark} that [one]{.mark} or more nuclear [missile]{.mark}s
[will penetrate]{.mark} even the best missile defense system. [Since a
single]{.mark} nuclear missile [hit would cause unacceptable damage
to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, a [missile
defense]{.mark} system [shouldn't change]{.mark} U.S. strategic
[calculations with]{.mark} respect to [its enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Washington should treat North Korea, Iran, and other adversaries the
same before and after setting up missile defense systems. Recently,
Schelling publicly stated that missile defense will be of dubious value
in addressing the possible future threats from Iran.

For example, both Russia and China are developing hypersonic missiles,

intercontinental ballistic missiles, these new systems fly along an
unpredictable path, and the GMD system is not capable of dealing with
such a threat. Russia has also unveiled evasive and creative
new delivery systems, including a nuclear torpedo and a nuclear cruise
missile. These new Russian offensive missiles are in direct response to
US insistence on strategic missile defense---and exist solely for the
purpose of defeating it.

[Adding to the challenges, missile [interceptors are]{.mark} far [more
expensive than]{.mark} offensive [missiles]{.mark}. That [makes it
cost-effective for]{.mark} US [adversaries]{.mark} to [just build more
and more]{.mark} missiles [to overwhelm]{.mark} US
[defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. In turn, this prompts the United States
to respond by making more and more interceptors, virtually ensuring a
new arms race. That sort of instability is exactly what the United
States should try to avoid. In fact, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty was enacted to deal with this exact scenario. Unfortunately, the
United States pulled out of the treaty in 2002, due in part to advice
from current National Security Advisor John Bolton, who worked as Under
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security at the
time.

Dissuade countries from building ICBMs

[[Many factors go into]{.mark} a country's [decision]{.mark}-making
about whether [to develop ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline} technology and at
what cost. [These may [include]{.mark}]{.underline} the country's desire
for [international [prestige]{.mark} or for [space
launch]{.mark}]{.underline} capability, its [perception of its
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} and its security challenges,
[[and]{.mark} its assessment of]{.underline} what [[other
options]{.underline}]{.mark} exist for addressing these challenges and
achieving its aims.

[[Dissuasion assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that the prospect of [facing a
[missile defense reduces]{.mark} an [adversary's]{.mark} assessed [value
of]{.mark} ballistic [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} and shifts its
cost/benefit calculation [enough [to convince it to forego
developing]{.mark} missiles]{.underline}.

This logic suggests that a missile defense system would be most likely
to dissuade if it were highly effective---enough to make an adversary's
attack very unlikely to succeed. In contrast, a modestly effective or
ineffective defense system or one of unknown effectiveness may equally
well spur an adversary to build more, or more sophisticated, missiles
than it otherwise would. For example, the GMD system (and other elements
of US missile defense) appears to be a factor in Chinese decisions about
expanding and improving its strategic missile force (OSD 2015).

[It is important to note that [to dissuade]{.mark}, a missile
[defense]{.mark} system [would]{.mark} not only [need to be]{.mark} very
[effective]{.mark}, but that this effectiveness needs to be understood
by the potential adversaries]{.underline}. How can the defensive
capabilities of the GMD be communicated? A set of successful intercept
tests would provide visible markers of an effective defense. However,
[the [GMD's poor]{.mark} test [record is]{.mark} clearly
[unconvincing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States has other means to
signal to potential adversaries that it has faith in the GMD's
effectiveness: for example, by consistently spending significant amounts
of money on it and by making official statements that exaggerate the GMD
system's capability (see Appendix 9: Quotes about Effectiveness).

Just as [[a scarecrow is only effective when]{.mark} the [crows believe
it's real]{.mark}]{.underline}, the GMD system can only affect an
adversary's decisions to the extent its capability is believable. [The
evidence suggests that the [missile defense]{.mark} "scarecrow" [does
not work. Neither Iran nor No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea has [been
dissuaded]{.mark} from developing long-range missile
technology.]{.underline}

Consider North Korea. As a result of intensive diplomatic engagement by
the Clinton administration, in 1998 North Korea instituted a moratorium
on flight testing its missiles; this moratorium was significant because
flight tests are critical for developing longer-range missiles and can
be monitored by satellites and radars. However, following a period of
increased tension with the United States, [North Korea]{.underline}
ended the moratorium and [[conducted]{.underline}]{.mark} an
unsuccessful [[flight test of a]{.mark} long-range
[rocket]{.mark}]{.underline} in July 2006---nearly [[two years
after]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark} was declared operational. [Since
then]{.mark}, North Korea has conducted [five]{.mark} additional
[launches]{.mark}]{.underline} of long-range rockets, including
successful launches of satellites into orbit in December 2012 and
February 2016 (Spaceflight101 2016; Harlan 2012). These launchers use
the same technology North Korea could use in a long-range ballistic
missile.

[[Similarly, Iran]{.mark} continued to [develop]{.mark} its rocket
technology after the GMD system was fielded]{.underline}. It launched
four small satellites into orbit [[between 2009 and
2015]{.underline}]{.mark} and is reportedly preparing to launch its more
capable Simorgh booster in the near future. While Simorgh development
appears to have been delayed for several years, possibly by sanctions
(Grego 2016), [[there is no evidence]{.mark} that development of the
[GMD]{.mark} system [has dissuaded]{.mark}]{.underline} Iran from
pursuing [missile [development]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Costs and Risks of Deploying the GMD System

The preceding discussion illustrates that the GMD system has serious
limits in how much it can contribute to the goals of dissuading
countries from building missiles, deterring those countries from using
them, or reliably protecting the cities those missiles might target.
[Reassuring the public and allies relies on exaggerations about the
capabilities of the defense.]{.underline}

[Continuing [to]{.mark} develop and [deploy]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark}
system [and exaggerate]{.mark} its [capabilities]{.mark}
can]{.underline}, paradoxically, [[create risks that outweigh
the]{.mark} potential [benefits]{.mark} of an unreliable defense.
[If]{.mark} US political and military [leaders overestimate]{.mark} the
[capability]{.mark} of the defense, [it can lead them to]{.mark} take
actions that can actually *[increase]{.mark}* the [risk of a]{.mark}
missile [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} against the United States.

First, while technical experts may understand the actual limitations of
the GMD system, political and military leaders may not.
[[Overestimating]{.mark} the [ability of]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark} system
to defend against ballistic missiles may [lead]{.mark} these [officials
to pursue]{.mark} more [aggressive policies in a crisis]{.mark}---which
could [increase]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} that [an adversary]{.mark}
would [launch missiles at]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates---[in]{.mark} the [mistaken belief]{.mark} that [the
defense could counter]{.mark} such [an attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, the largely untested GMD system cannot reliably defend against
such an attack. As a result, [an unrealistic belief in the capability of
the defense [could]{.mark} lead to actions that [escalate a crisis and
increase]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} nuclear [warheads exploding on US
territory]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, [a [mistaken belief]{.mark} by policy makers and the public that
the [GMD]{.mark} system [is]{.mark} an [effective]{.mark} response to
the spread of ballistic missiles [could reduce]{.mark} the [incentive
to]{.mark} vigorously [pursue other]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
[more effective [approaches]{.mark} to the problem]{.underline}. For
example, [[if policy makers believe]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark} system can
defend against a]{.underline} North Korean [missile attack, they [may
have less incentive to support diplomatic
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} that are likely needed [to ultimately
reduce the probability of such an attack.]{.underline}

Third, US development of a national missile defense system can affect
Chinese and Russian actions in ways that reduce US security. For
example, while Chinese analysts are understandably skeptical of the
capabilities of the GMD system, they remain concerned that US
investments in missile defense, and US cooperation on missile defense
with countries on China's periphery, could pose a potential long-term
challenge to China's own security.

Moreover, the US focus on missile defense and technologies that could
target Chinese missiles suggests to Chinese analysts that US leaders may
want to deny China a nuclear retaliatory capability so the United States
could exert nuclear coercion (Kulacki 2014). These actions sow distrust
and resentment that undermine efforts to reduce nuclear threats. They
also create pressure for China to take steps to improve its retaliatory
ability, for example, by increasing the size of its arsenal and putting
its missiles on alert status (Kulacki 2016). Indeed, China's decision to
put multiple warheads on its missiles, which the Pentagon sees partly as
a reaction to US defenses, actually increases the number of nuclear
warheads aimed at the United States (OSD 2015).

Similarly, Russia's consistently negative reaction to US missile
defenses contributes to deterioration in relations and a deadlock in
further arms cuts. The lack of progress in nuclear arms reduction leaves
a larger number of missiles pointed at the United States than there
might otherwise be.

[A [strategic]{.mark} missile [defense]{.mark} system that
[increases]{.mark} the [number of warheads aimed at]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and increases the risk of
an attack---[while at the same time not providing an effective
defense]{.underline} against such an attack---[makes us less
safe]{.underline}.

Finally, the enormous expense of the missile defense enterprise
effectively prioritizes it out of proportion to its actual potential to
contribute to security. That high cost diverts resources from where they
may be better spent, especially under the constrained budget environment
that is expected for the foreseeable future.

The costs discussed here are significant---not only the \$40 billion
price tag, but also the increased risks that come with pursuing
strategic missile defense. And they certainly outweigh the benefits of
an ineffective and unreliable defense system. [[It is crucial]{.mark}
that Congress]{.underline}, the administration, and the American people
[[appraise]{.underline}]{.mark} with clear eyes [what role the
[GMD]{.mark} system can play]{.underline} and at what cost, [[rather
than]{.mark} simply [supporting]{.mark} missile [defense
uncritically]{.mark}.]{.underline}

An ally might try to understand whether and how these changes will
affect U.S. capabilities. [The 45 percent [increase in GBIs]{.mark}
likely [would not result in]{.mark} a significant [improvement in
performance]{.mark}. With]{.underline} a shot doctrine--- referring to
the number of [defensive missiles launched against every incoming
ICBM]{.underline}---of two or four GBIs per target, [the
[current]{.mark} U.S. homeland-[defense]{.mark}]{.underline} system
probably [[can engage only]{.mark} about ten to [twenty]{.mark} threat
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}. 147 [An informed observer could
determine]{.underline} that [adding twenty GBIs would enable the United
States to defend against only five to ten more missiles, at best.
Improvements to U.S. [homeland defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} that are
harder for an ally to quantify [may be [more likely to raise concerns of
abandonment]{.mark}. Employing the SM-3 Block IIA]{.underline} as a
homeland defense weapon, for example, [would blur the]{.underline}
previously clear [lines between homeland defense and regional weapon
systems]{.underline}, and it would be difficult for an observer to
determine the quantity and types of weapons in the vertical launchers of
a BMD-capable ship or an Aegis Ashore site. 148

Despite these potential challenges, an open dialogue with allies should
express that [[BMD alone]{.mark} is [not]{.mark} likely to
[provide]{.mark} sufficient [protection for]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [but]{.mark} will instead [remain]{.mark} a [thin
defense]{.mark} against a relatively small-scale attack]{.underline},
and therefore only one part of U.S. security strategy. [Put another
way]{.underline}, capacity and capability [[constraints]{.mark} might
[reassure U.S. allies about the]{.mark} extent and [intent of]{.mark}
U.S. [BMD]{.mark} systems, [and]{.mark} thus [limit concerns
about]{.mark} alliance [cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Speaking about
how an adversary could view U.S. BMD, Frank Rose, then Assistant
Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, said
in 2016 that he did not think BMD was destabilizing, because the United
States has "limited numbers, limited capabilities, and we have been
very, very transparent about our missile defenses." 149 Transparency
with allies---particularly about missile-defense budgets, procurement,
testing, and deployment plans---may similarly stabilize their
perceptions of U.S. commitment. At least among democratic allies,
transparency also may help voters in allied countries make
better-informed decisions about missile defense. Private and public
transparency with U.S. allies about missile threats and defenses should
continue. 150

[Reassure]{.underline} the public and [US allies]{.underline}

As discussed in the preceding sections, the GMD system is not useful in
dissuading, increasing deterrence, or reliably protecting cities---and
has no realistic prospect of doing so in the future. What about
reassurance?

American leaders confronted with the possibility of a long-range nuclear
missile threat by a country such as North Korea have strong motivations
to assure the US public they are effectively dealing with the threat and
protecting the populace from a nuclear strike. [[Supporting missile
defense]{.mark} is a way [to signal]{.mark}]{.underline} this,
[[regardless of whether]{.mark} the [defense is actually
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And once the United States has begun to build a missile defense system,
leaders have an incentive to overstate the system's defensive
capabilities, for several reasons. For example, they may believe the
scarecrow is effective and that exaggerating the capabilities of the
defense adds to its ability to dissuade or deter an adversary.

Moreover, creating the perception that the GMD system can defend cities
from a missile strike reduces public concerns that might otherwise deter
decision makers from taking risky military or political actions. [This
false perception of capability also helps US officials reassure allies
that the United States will not be deterred from acting on its security
guarantees because it fears a North Korean missile strike. [However,
since]{.mark} these [perceptions are not backed]{.mark} up [by
actual]{.mark} defense [capability]{.mark}, any [reassurance]{.mark}
they give [is unjustified]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the same way that a scarecrow is a metaphor for using the perceived
capability of the defense for dissuasion or deterrence, [attempting [to
reassure]{.mark}]{.underline} the public and [US [allies by
claiming]{.mark} the [defense]{.mark} system [has capabilities it does
not]{.mark} in fact have [is]{.mark} similar to [using it as a
placebo]{.mark}. Political and military officials may see the current
value of the GMD system as stemming from its perceived capability rather
than its actual]{.underline}, demonstrated capability. This view is
consistent with the repeated claims by government officials that the
system is effective, despite a preponderance of technical evidence that
it is not. It is also consistent with policy makers favoring more
missile defense over better missile defense, such as the preference for
deploying more untested interceptors rather than making the painstaking
effort to build interceptors that work reliably.

This tension is reflected in the dogged congressional support of an East
Coast missile defense site despite repeated statements by the MDA and
the Pentagon that it needs to spend resources on improving what it has,
not adding a new site that would drain billions of dollars from the
budget.

Ironically, in addition to drawing resources away from development and
testing, [[prioritizing]{.mark} the [perceived capability]{.mark} of the
system [can work against]{.mark} efforts to improve the system's actual
capability]{.underline} in another important way. While better oversight
and rigorous testing are critical for building an improved system, in
the short term [[they are likely to expose]{.mark} the [GMD]{.mark}
system's [shortcomings and undermine]{.mark} its [capability as
reassurance]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, prioritizing the
perceived value of the system may lead to opposition to better oversight
and testing, thereby undermining more effective development efforts.

**Lane 13**, Reporter, AAAS, citing Philip Coyle, Senior Science Fellow,

Experts Say," AAAS,
https://www.aaas.org/news/ground-based-missile-defense-system-has-serious-flaws-experts-say)

Lewis said [[the]{.mark} projected [reliability]{.mark} numbers [for the
system]{.mark}]{.underline} --- percentages in the high 90s --- [[are
overstated]{.mark} and adding more interceptors will not]{.underline},
by itself, [increase the system\'s effectiveness]{.underline}. The Obama
administration, citing concerns about North Korea\'s long-range missile
advances, recently announced plans to add 14 more interceptors, bringing
the total to 44 as originally envisioned by the Bush administration.

[To accomplish true mid-course interception]{.underline} of a
threatening missile, [[the defense]{.mark} system [must track]{.mark}
the [missile just after]{.mark} it is [launched]{.mark}]{.underline} and
during its suborbital flight toward its target. [The system uses
satellite-based sensors]{.underline} to detect the missile\'s launch and
a variety of ground- and sea-based radars to track it during flight.
[These include]{.underline} four (and eventually six) [upgraded early
warning radars]{.underline} that date back to the Cold War era,
forward-based mobile radars called TPY-2s in Turkey and Japan, Aegis
radars on Navy cruisers and destroyers, and a large radar called SBX
that is based on a floating platform at sea.

According to Lewis, [the early-warning [radars can track small
targets]{.mark} or clusters of targets [but have]{.mark} essentially [no
ability to distinguish]{.mark} between [a warhead and]{.mark} a booster
[rocket]{.mark} stage [or debris]{.mark}]{.underline}. The TPY-2s and
the SBX use microwaves in the X-band segment of the electromagnetic
spectrum, with wavelengths twenty times smaller than those of the early
warning radars. In theory, these shorter wavelengths should provide
higher-resolution images of the targets, Lewis said.

[But [the measure]{.mark} of how detectable a warhead is [by
radar]{.mark}]{.underline} (its radar cross section) [[can be quite
small]{.underline}]{.mark}, depending on the size of the object, the
material of which it is made, the angle at which the radar beam hits the
object, and other factors. [That [makes it]{.mark} very
[difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}, even for the available X-band radars,
[[to]{.mark} reliably [discriminate]{.mark} between true warheads and
countermeasures such as [decoys]{.mark} or pieces of chaff]{.underline}
made of aluminum or other materials. Moreover, the SBX, [[the most
powerful]{.mark} X-band [radar in the system, has been]{.mark}
semi-[mothballed due to budget]{.mark} constraints]{.underline}, Lewis
said. (A National Academy of Sciences study panel has recommended
deployment of new X-band radars consisting of stacked TPY-2s at five
locations around the world.)

Midcourse Countermeasures

The challenge of exo-atmospheric countermeasures has been part of the
public discussion of ballistic missile defense for 50 years. In the
absence of air resistance, light and heavy objects travel on
indistinguishable trajectories in outer space. [[Warheads]{.mark} can be
[concealed in clouds]{.mark} of radar-reflecting chaff or inside
aluminized [balloons]{.mark}, and [decoys]{.mark} can be
[constructed]{.mark} of very lightweight materials]{.underline}. The
temperatures and therefore the infrared signatures of objects also can
be manipulated in outer space by varying their surface coatings or by
adding small battery-powered or chemical heat sources inside.

[All]{.underline} five of the original [nuclear-weapon states have
developed countermeasures for their long-range]{.underline}
nuclear-armed [ballistic missiles]{.underline}.8 Many countermeasures
are simple enough such that a 1999 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate
concluded that

> \[m\]any countries, such as [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea,
> [Iran]{.mark}, [and Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[would

[A 2012 study]{.underline} by the National Academy of Sciences
[found]{.underline}, however, that [[the MDA]{.mark} had
[abandoned]{.mark} significant [efforts to deal with
counter]{.mark}measure[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Details about the testing of U.S. interceptors against countermeasures
are highly classified, but there is no public indication of change in
the fundamental fact that, because of their susceptibility to
countermeasures, ballistic missile defense systems requiring
exo-atmospheric interception can promise little in the way of effective
defense. Building and deploying them wastes billions of dollars that
could be used more effectively on other activities, including
potentially more effective types of ballistic missile defense.

#### There's almost no chance it could be an effective deterrent.

However, [it [would be unwise]{.mark}]{.underline} for policymakers or
the American people [[to assume]{.mark} that the [GMD
could]{.mark} reliably [defend]{.mark} the U.S. [homeland from]{.mark}
a [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean [ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
Tuesday's [test]{.underline} was more realistic than previous ones, it
was [still tightly controlled and predictable compared to a wartime use
of an ICBM]{.underline} by North Korea. Moreover, [expanding the
quantity]{.underline} and quality [of U.S. homeland missile defense
systems could prompt negative countermoves]{.underline} by other nuclear
powers.

Three important technical caveats should curb the enthusiasm of missile
defense advocates. First, the target missile barely qualified as [an
ICBM]{.underline}. Such missiles [have a minimum range of
5,500 km]{.underline}. According to a pre‐​test analysis by Laura
Grego at the Union of Concerned Scientists, the target [[missile used
in]{.mark} the [test had]{.mark} a [range of]{.mark}]{.underline}
approximately [[5,800]{.mark} km. [Any No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean
[ICBM would]{.mark} have to [fly much farther]{.mark}]{.underline} than
5,800 km [to reach U.S. territory, [which means a faster]{.mark} burnout
[speed]{.mark}]{.underline} for the missile. A North Korean ICBM headed
for Hawaii or the mainland United States [would be moving
faster]{.underline} than the target missile used in Tuesday's test,
[which [makes a]{.mark} successful [intercept more
difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, the kill vehicle tested Tuesday is not widely deployed across
the GMD system. Two kill vehicles are currently deployed across the

[Neither]{.mark} of these models has [been tested against]{.mark} an
[ICBM]{.mark} target, and [both have low success

in yesterday's test, the CE-II Block 1, is not yet deployed on the GMD
fleet. According to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, by the end of 2017 there should be eight CE-II
Block 1 kill vehicles out of 44 total.

Finally, [the test was scripted and far less complicated than a North
Korean wartime ICBM launch would be]{.underline}. The launch point of
the target ICBM was also known in advance of the test, which makes it
easier to intercept. [[In a]{.mark}n actual [conflict it is highly
unlikely]{.mark} that the [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean ICBM [launch
point would be known]{.mark} in advance]{.underline}, especially
since all of North Korea's ballistic missiles are mobile.

Deter missile attacks

[The GMD system cannot meaningfully increase
deterrence]{.underline}---to make a missile attack from a country like
North Korea less likely---for several reasons.

The primary way a missile defense system helps deter an attack is by
creating uncertainty about whether an adversary's attack would succeed.
A low chance of success may make the adversary less likely to launch the
attack. This uncertainty argument dates to the Cold War, and was
applicable to a peer adversary like the Soviet Union (or Russia), which
might have contemplated a carefully planned and coordinated
"counterforce" strike against hardened US military targets, including
nuclear missile silos. Successfully destroying these targets would
reduce the ability of the United States to retaliate. In such a peer
scenario, missile defense could create uncertainty about how much of the
US retaliatory force the attack might leave intact. That uncertainty
could therefore increase deterrence of a nuclear first strike.

[The]{.underline} same [logic does not apply to an attack that a country
such as [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea, [Iran]{.mark}, or even
[China]{.mark} might consider. These countries' missile [arsenals are
too small]{.mark} and inaccurate [to mount a]{.mark}n effective
[counterforce]{.mark} strike [on]{.mark} hardened [US]{.mark} military
targets]{.underline}. (Currently, neither North Korea nor Iran has
missiles that could reach the United States, and Iran has not tested a
nuclear weapon.) [[Instead, they]{.mark} would [target US
cities]{.mark}]{.underline} or other large, unhardened sites. [US
[missile defenses]{.mark} would [be irrelevant]{.mark} to deterrence
[because]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates would
[retain]{.mark} a [retaliatory capability]{.mark}]{.underline} in any
scenario.

[[The primary factor in deterring]{.mark} North Korea]{.underline} from
launching nuclear weapons against the United States [[is]{.mark} the
[certainty of]{.mark} a devastating [US response]{.mark}.
The]{.underline} presence or [[absence of]{.mark} US [missile defense
makes no]{.mark} meaningful [difference compared
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [deterrence afforded by [US offensive
nuclear]{.mark} and conventional [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Some argue]{.mark} that homeland missile defense offers a different
kind of deterrence, by taking the option of a "cheap shot"---launching
just a few missiles---off the table for North Korea]{.underline}, and
forcing it to either stay its hand or escalate to a larger attack
(Roberts 2014). [The implication is that [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline} knows with certainty the United States would
retaliate if it were to attack with a large number of missiles, but
[[might believe]{.mark} the [US may refrain from retaliation]{.mark} if
the number of missiles were small]{.underline}. By taking the option of
a small attack off the table, the argument goes, missile defense would
serve to deter a small attack. [[However]{.mark}, because [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rean [missiles would]{.mark} necessarily [target
cities]{.mark}]{.underline} or other soft targets, [[it is not credible
to imagine]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [retaliating
differently]{.mark} depending on whether North Korea launched a few or
many nuclear weapons against US cities]{.underline}.

Further, [[if No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean leadership [was not]{.mark}
making [rational]{.mark} decisions, or was [considering
a]{.mark}]{.underline} last-ditch [[vengeance attack]{.mark} on the
United States as its regime collapsed, [neither]{.mark} offensive nor
defensive [forces would]{.mark} act as a
[deter]{.mark}rent.]{.underline}

#### The statistical noise of the chance of a first strike in the first place means missile defense is a completely inconsiderable factor in issuing missile threats. 

**Podvig 9**, Physicist, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
(Pavel Podvig, September 14, 2009, "The false promise of missile
defense," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2009/09/the-false-promise-of-missile-defense/)

The fundamental problem with this argument is that missile defense will
never live up to these expectations. Let me say that again: [Missile
[defense will never make a]{.mark} shred of [difference when]{.mark} it
comes to]{.underline} its primary mission--[[protecting]{.mark} a
country [from]{.mark} the threat of [a]{.mark} nuclear [missile
attack]{.mark}. That isn't to say that advanced sensors and interceptors
someday won't be able to deal with sophisticated missiles]{.underline}
and decoys. [They probably will. But again, this won't overcome the
fundamental challenge]{.underline} of keeping a nation safe against a
nuclear threat, [[because it would take only]{.mark} a [small
probability]{.mark} of success [to make]{.mark} such [a threat credible
while]{.mark} missile [defense would need]{.mark} to offer [absolute
certainty]{.mark}]{.underline} of protection to truly be effective.

This was fairly easy to grasp during the Cold War. At that time, it was
clear that no defense could realistically protect people against
thousands of warheads. But now that the Cold War is over and the threat
involves a handful of warheads (if that many), the goal of building a
working missile defense system seems within reach. Indeed, how hard
would it be to intercept a rudimentary missile launched by North Korea?
The answer seems simple: Not easy, but definitely doable. But it's the
wrong question to ask. Instead, we should ask: Would missile defense
change Washington's strategic calculation in a potential conflict with
North Korea or Iran? The answer to this question is a firm no.

In a real confrontation, [missile [defense]{.mark} would [be irrelevant
at best]{.mark}]{.underline}. For starters, the probability of a country
such as North Korea successfully launching a missile capable of
delivering a nuclear warhead to U.S. territory is low. So [[when
all]{.mark} of the [uncertainties]{.mark} in missile and warhead
performance [are added up]{.mark}, the [chance of success]{.mark}
probably [wouldn't be higher than a few percent]{.mark}]{.underline}
(which, by the way, is considered a highly potent threat worthy of a
multibillion dollar investment in missile defense). [Missile
defense]{.underline} eventually [might be able to reduce that
chance]{.underline}, maybe even considerably, [but it will never reduce
it to zero]{.underline}. In other words, [[the defending side]{.mark}
would [still face a threat that isn't]{.mark} much [less credible
than]{.mark} it was [without missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. So
the best missile defense can do is to replace one small probability with
another. [[Yet, since nobody knows]{.mark} what [exactly the]{.mark}se
[probabilities]{.mark} are in the first place, [it would just add
one]{.mark} more level of [uncertainty to an already uncertain situation
without making a]{.mark} fundamental [difference]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### First strikes make no sense!

(Joe Cirincione, September 17, 2017, "No, We Cannot Shoot Down North
Korea's Missiles," Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/09/no-we-cannot-shoot-down-north-koreas-missiles/141070/)

What about our long-range defenses, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense,
or [[GMD]{.underline}]{.mark}, interceptors based in Alaska and
California? There the [test record is even worse. Even under ideal
conditions]{.underline}, where the defenders knew the time, direction
and trajectory of the test target and all the details of its shape,
temperature, etc., [this system [has only hit]{.mark} its target
[half]{.mark} of [the time]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[The [success rate]{.mark} of the GMD systems in flight intercept tests
[has been dismal]{.mark}]{.underline}," says former director of
operational testing for the Pentagon, Philip Coyle. [Our
[chances]{.mark} of intercepting a threat missile]{.underline}, even
under ideal conditions, [[are]{.mark} basically "at least as good as [a
coin toss]{.mark},"]{.underline} says the former head of the Missile
Defense Agency, retired Lt. Gen. Trey Obering.

Yet, reporters routinely use [words like "shield" and
"dome"]{.underline} to describe our supposed capability, [giving us a
false sense of security]{.underline}. Officials make the matter worse
with exaggerated, if carefully constructed, claims. "The United States
military can defend against a limited North Korea attack on Seoul, Japan
and the United States," said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General
Joseph Dunford at the annual Aspen Security Forum in July.

Is this true? It depends what you mean by the word "limited."

[[If No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline} cooperated and
[[shot]{.mark} their new [i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental
[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile]{.underline}, the Hwasong-14, [at
the United States [with adequate warning]{.mark}]{.underline} so that we
could prepare, and [[if the warhead looked]{.mark} pretty much [like we
expect it to]{.mark} look, and [if they only shot one]{.mark}, and [if
they did not]{.mark} try to [spoof]{.mark} the defense [with
decoys]{.mark}]{.underline} that looked like the warhead, [[or
block]{.mark} the [defense with]{.mark} low-power [jammers, or
hide]{.mark} the [warhead in a cloud]{.mark} of chaff,
[or]{.mark}]{.underline} blind the defense by [[attack]{.mark}ing the
vulnerable [radars, then, maybe]{.mark} this is true. The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might have]{.mark} a [50-50
chance]{.mark} of hitting such a missile]{.underline}. If we had time to
fire four or five interceptors, then the odds could go up.

[[But No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea is unlikely to cooperate. It [will do
everything]{.mark} possible [to suppress]{.mark} the
[defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 1999 National Intelligence Estimate
of the Ballistic Threat to the United States noted that [[any country
capable of testing a]{.mark} long-range bal[listic missile would]{.mark}
"[rely]{.mark} initially [on]{.mark}]{.underline} readily available
technology -- including separating RVs \[[[reentry
vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}\], spin-stabilized RVs, RV reorientation,
[[radar absorbing material]{.mark}, booster [fragmentation]{.mark},
low-power [jammers]{.mark}, chaff, [and]{.mark} simple
([balloon]{.mark}) [decoys]{.mark}]{.underline} -- to develop
penetration aids and countermeasures."

[[Our]{.mark} anti-missile [systems]{.mark} have [never been]{.mark}
realistically [tested against]{.mark} any of [these]{.mark}]{.underline}
simple countermeasures. This is one reason that the Pentagon's current
director of operational testing is much more cautious in his assessments
than missile defense program officials. "GMD has demonstrate a limited
capability to defend the U.S. Homeland from small numbers of simple
intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile threats
launched from North Korea or Iran," he reports. Moreover, [it is
impossible]{.underline}, he says, [to "quantitatively assess GMD
performance due to lack of ground tests]{.underline}" and "the
reliability and availability of the operational GBI's \[Ground-Based
Interceptors\] is low, and [the MDA continues to discover new failure
modes during testing]{.underline}."  

Yet, we have spent \$40 billion on the GMD system and over \$320 billion
on scores of missile defense systems over the past few decades. You have
to wonder exactly what [these tests are for]{.underline}: give the
troops the protection they need or [give the contractors the next
program payment]{.underline}?

[The US only has a limited ability to destroy an incoming nuclear
intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline}, a study released last
month by the American Physical Society concluded. It said that "[the
current capabilities are low and will]{.underline} likely [continue to
be low for the next 15 years]{.underline}" to protect the US against a
strike [from North Korea]{.underline}, which has an estimated 20 nuclear
warheads and relatively unsophisticated missiles. The Pentagon disputes
the findings and says the most recent tests show the system can handle a
North Korean attack.

But [the [ability to defend against]{.mark} an attack by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is estimated to have nearly 6,000
nuclear warheads and highly sophisticated missile technology,
[[is]{.mark} practically [nonexistent]{.mark}]{.underline}. The US
system is no match against a large number of incoming missiles ---
precisely the kind of attack that Russia would launch, experts said.

"[This [idea of]{.mark} an [impenetrable shield]{.mark}]{.underline}
against an enormous arsenal of Russian missiles [[is]{.mark} just a
[fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Laura Grego, a fellow at MIT's
Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy who co-chaired the American
Physical Society team that wrote the report. "[It's too hard to
do]{.underline}."

[It's so difficult that the US intentionally hasn't even tried.
[Official Pentagon policy states]{.mark} that its [system is
only]{.mark} designed [to protect]{.mark} the nation [from]{.mark}
nuclear [missiles]{.mark} fired [by a rogue state]{.mark}]{.underline}
like North Korea. [For a military superpower]{.underline} like Russia,
[[the US depends on its]{.mark} own vast [nuclear arsenal of]{.mark}
about [5,400 warheads as a deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's a
doctrine [known]{.underline} to those who grew up during the Cold War
[as mutual assured destruction or [MAD]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [any
nuclear attack on the US [would result in]{.mark} a
[counterstrike]{.mark}]{.underline} that would annihilate both
countries.

"[The United States relies on nuclear deterrence to address
the]{.underline} large and [more sophisticated Russian and
Chinese]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missile
[capabilities]{.underline}," according to the Defense Department's most
recent Missile Defense Review.

That's probably surprising, and frightening, to many people, experts
said.

"It's fundamentally uncomfortable, this idea that we let the other guy
have the ability to take us out and we expect the other guy to let us
have the ability to do that, and we're both going to stay rational and
neither of us is going to cause the other to act on it," said Ankit
Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

Analysts have raised concerns that Putin has not been acting rational in
his attack on Ukraine and in statements like the one he made when
launching the invasion.

"Anyone who tries to interfere with us, or even more so, to create
threats for our country and our people, must know that Russia's response
will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have
never before experienced in your history," he said in a televised
speech. A few days later, he announced Russia's nuclear forces had been
placed in "special combat readiness." The US downplayed the move and
gave no indication it changed its own nuclear readiness level, known by
another frightening Cold War-era acronym called DEFCON.

Panda said many Americans don't realize the US has little protection
against a nuclear attack.

"I've seen it on my Twitter mentions," he said. "I've been critical of
setting up a no-fly zone partially on the basis of escalation risks and
people reply, 'Well, let the Russians try to nuke us. We have a missile
shield, we'll be fine.' It's just a very pervasive misunderstanding."

[The [US must depend on]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence because]{.mark} the
[arithmetic of]{.mark} our [limited]{.mark} missile [defense]{.mark}
system and Russia's massive arsenal [doesn't add
up]{.mark}]{.underline}, said Robert Soofer, who served as deputy
assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy
during the Trump administration. [[Russia can overwhelm]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} system [by launching]{.mark} many [more]{.mark} nuclear
[missiles than]{.mark} it [could]{.mark} possibly [knock out
with]{.mark} its small squadron of ground-based
[interceptors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[There are ways that Russia can strike the United States that really
[makes the GBI]{.mark} system [virtually useless]{.mark}]{.underline},"
said Soofer, a nonresident senior associate with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank. "If
Russia wants to penetrate US missile defenses, they can."

#### Retaliation solves\-\--that's a sufficient deterrent.

[What about deterrence?]{.underline} The primary way a [[missile
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} system [[helps deter]{.underline}]{.mark}
an attack is [by creating uncertainty in the adversary's mind about
whether that attack would succeed]{.underline} in achieving its goals.
Under Cold War thinking, if a peer adversary such as the Soviet Union
(or Russia) contemplated a carefully planned strike against hardened US
military targets, and if effective missile defenses existed, the
adversary might be uncertain how much of the US retaliatory force would
remain intact after the attack. According to this logic, missile defense
would help deter an adversary's nuclear first strike.

[The same [logic does not apply]{.mark} to an attack that a country such
as North Korea, Iran, or even China might consider. These
[countries']{.mark} missile [arsenals are too small]{.mark} and
inaccurate [to mount a]{.mark}n effective [counterforce strike on
hardened]{.mark} US [military targets; they would]{.mark} necessarily
[target cities]{.mark} and civilian infrastructure. [Central in
deterring]{.mark} North Korea from launching nuclear weapons against the
United States [is the certainty of a]{.mark} devastating [US
response]{.mark}]{.underline}. The presence or absence of US [[missile
defense has no]{.mark} meaningful [effect on]{.mark} the
[deterrence]{.mark} already [afforded by US offensive nuclear and
conventional forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Silo Survivability Simulations

The scenarios investigated in our work were based on the assertion made
in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review that "[[To destroy]{.mark} U.S.
[ICBMs]{.mark} \[silo-based missiles\] on the ground, an
[adversary]{.mark} would [need to launch a precise]{.mark}ly coordinated
[attack with hundreds of]{.mark} high-yield and accurate [warheads. This
is]{.mark} an [insurmountable]{.mark} challenge [for any]{.mark}
potential [adversary]{.mark} today, [with the exception of
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}." 

Following this view, [[we developed]{.mark} four attack
[scenarios]{.mark} in [which Russia targets]{.mark} each of the 400
[U.S. silos with]{.mark} one warhead, two warheads, three warheads, and
finally [all of its]{.mark} deployed ballistic [missiles]{.mark} (in
silos, on road-mobile launchers, and on submarines). We
used probabilistic computer simulations of missile accuracy and blast
effects [to estimate]{.mark} the [number]{.mark} of silos [that would
survive]{.mark} the attack, [and ran 10,000 sim]{.mark}ulation[s for
each]{.mark} attack scenario]{.underline}. (Details of missile accuracy
and warhead yields are available in supplemental information). [Most
Russian ballistic missiles carry multiple warheads on independently
targeted reentry vehicles, which imposes constraints on a Russian attack
because there is a physical limit to how far apart the individual
warheads]{.underline} carried by the same missile [can be
targeted]{.underline}. Our simulations target the individual warheads to
optimize their performance.

The findings for each of the four attack profiles are shown in Figure 1.
[In each case, [we assumed unrealistically high performance]{.mark} for
Russia's weapons. [Our findings]{.mark} therefore [overestimated]{.mark}
the [damage Russia could do]{.mark} to U.S. nuclear forces]{.underline}.
Specifically, [our calculations [assumed]{.mark} Russian missiles would
suffer [no]{.mark} launch [failures, duds]{.mark}, navigation errors,
flight-control [errors, or any other]{.mark} failure that would prevent
them from reaching their targets. We also assumed zero fratricide, which
is]{.underline} to say [Russia's]{.underline} nuclear [detonations would
not disrupt other incoming Russian warheads. The smallest attack left
the United States with 205 ± 9 missiles, which is just over half of the
existing force. [The largest attack left 102]{.mark} ± 9 missiles. [In
addition]{.mark} to these silo-based missiles, the United States would
still retain about [1,000]{.mark} nuclear [warheads]{.mark} deployed [on
sub]{.mark}marine-based missile[s, and hundreds]{.mark} more to be
delivered [by bombers]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

Figure 1: Results of simulated attacks on U.S. missile silos by Russian
deployed ballistic missiles 1-, 2- and 3-warheads per silo, as well as
all ballistic missiles (214 silos targeted at 3-to-1 and 186 silos
targeted 4-to-1). [Error bars are 95 percent confidence
intervals]{.underline}.

Under the brinkmanship construct, the ability to deter Russia's first
strike rests on its assessment of both the probability that the United
States would decide to retaliate as well as the damage inflicted by that
retaliation. With respect to a decision to retaliate, adding launch
under attack would not change anything. If the attack were genuine, the
United States would respond. Launch under attack does make a decision to
use weapons more probable, but only for the subset of cases where the
early warning system gave a false alarm --- exactly those cases where
such a decision would be in error. 

That [leaves the question of whether the retaliation that the United
States could inflict after riding out an attack is comparable to that
under launch under attack. Leaving aside U.S. submarines, the number of
silo-based missiles [remaining would in all cases be sufficient to
execute]{.mark} the planned [catastrophic damage to Russia's
war]{.mark}-making [ability]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

First, consider the case where the United States launched all of its
silo-based missiles on warning of an incoming, large-scale attack. The
Russian arsenal accounts for 138 "counterforce" targets (126 silos,
seven mobile missile bases, three nuclear bomber bases, and two nuclear
missile submarine bases). To compensate for imperfect accuracy and
reliability, each aim point would likely be covered by multiple
warheads, as evidenced by declassified Cold War plans. Geographically
large targets, like bases, often have multiple aim points. Assuming two
warheads per aim point, and that bases have two aim points each while
silos have just one, the counterforce targets alone require 300 of the
400 available U.S. silo-based missiles. This would leave 100 weapons for
the remaining non-missile counterforce targets, leadership targets, and
strategic elements of Russia's war-making capability such as industry.

Now consider the case [after an all-out Russian attack in which the
United States did not launch its missile on warning. The 300
counter-missile targets are no longer meaningful targets, since Russia
used those weapons in its attack]{.underline}. The other types of
targets remain, [but now the United States can be expected to have, in
the worst case, 102 warheads for these targets where the initial plan
designated 100]{.underline}. The situation for the United States is
nearly the same regardless of whether the land-based missiles were
launched on warning of an incoming attack or not. [The
[remaining]{.mark} U.S. [land]{.mark}-based missile [force would]{.mark}
therefore [be adequate]{.mark} to perform its original mission.
[Moreover]{.mark}, the [hundreds of]{.mark} additional
[sub]{.mark}marine- [and bomber]{.mark}-based [weapons]{.mark} would
continue to [provide an excellent deterrent against other adversaries or
any rebuilt Russian force]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, if the United States had fewer nuclear weapons due to a
smaller land leg, nuclear deterrence might also be threatened because US
adversaries might be more willing to initiate and escalate militarized
challenges against the United States and its allies. Nuclear deterrence
has long been conceptualized as a game of nuclear brinkmanship.
[Although [nuclear states cannot]{.mark} credibly [threaten to launch a
suicidal nuclear war, they can]{.mark} credibly threaten to [risk one
by]{.mark} initiating and [escalating crises]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 A
state's willingness to stand firm in these crises depends, in part, on
its vulnerability to nuclear war. Recent social-science research shows
that states that are more vulnerable to a nuclear exchange are more
likely to be targeted with military threats from nuclear-armed states
and less likely to achieve their basic goals in a nuclear crisis.13
[[Accordingly]{.underline}]{.mark}, reducing the size of [[the]{.mark}
US [ICBM force]{.mark}]{.underline} would simultaneously increase US
vulnerability and [[decrease]{.underline}]{.mark} adversary
[[vulnerability to]{.mark} nuclear [coercion]{.mark}, thereby [shifting
the balance of resolve]{.mark}]{.underline} toward US adversaries.
[[Adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} might be more [[willing to
challenge]{.mark}, and stand firm in crises against, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, and Washington [might be [more eager
to]{.mark} seek [offramps]{.mark} in [a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This resulting shift in the balance of resolve could also increase the
risk of nuclear war. [[The]{.mark} most plausible [pathway to]{.mark}
nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline} in the contemporary international

If adversaries are more likely to initiate and escalate crises against a

also a greater risk that Washington will find itself in dangerous crises
that could spiral out of control and result in a catastrophic nuclear
exchange.

[[While]{.mark} U.S. [homeland]{.mark}]{.underline} and regional
[[defenses]{.mark} might [have a chance]{.mark}]{.underline} of shooting
down missiles that travel within the defended area of those systems,
[[shooting down]{.mark} a [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean
[missile]{.mark}]{.underline} on a test trajectory [[is a]{.mark}n
entirely different and even more [difficult
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the case of a potential North Korean ICBM test, [only the
ground-based midcourse defense system is designed to intercept such a
missile. But unless the test launch travels on a trajectory similar to
what North Korea would actually use to shoot at the United States --- a
gamble Pyongyang is unlikely to take --- the system will not be able to
engage it]{.underline}, as it is postured to defend the United States
and not the open ocean. Shooting down a North Korea medium- or
intermediate-range missile test might be possible using SM-3
interceptors launched from Aegis ships in the region, but [would be a
highly demanding task and entail a significant amount of guesswork, as
the ships would have to be in the right place at the right
time]{.underline} to stop a test at sea. Doing so also would mean taking
them away from optimal positions to defend actual targets on land.

Attempting to shoot down a non-threatening missile test would be hugely
provocative act and supply invaluable data to adversaries. A miss, which
is more likely than an intercept, would be embarrassing and undermine
confidence in U.S. defenses. For these reasons attempting to shoot down
such a test would appear to be a highly risky decision at best.
Furthermore, despite much speculation in the press about the U.S.
ability to hack North Korean missile tests, the data shows that North
Korea's missile tests are succeeding at a high rate and that the
failures are concentrated in new systems that had not been previously
tested.

Also, we sometimes forget North Korea gets a vote. As of 2015, the
Pentagon estimated that North Korea possessed over 100 launchers for
ballistic missiles and that number has likely grown since then. North
Korea has made significant progress in its ability to design and build
launchers and missiles indigenously, which will allow it to more easily
expand its missile force.

[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea is also [taking steps to
overwhelm]{.mark} and evade U.S. [defenses through]{.mark} such steps as
developing [solid-fueled]{.mark} mobile [missiles, practicing]{.mark} to
launch multiple missiles at the same time (known as [salvo
launches]{.mark}), [developing submarine]{.mark}-launched ballistic
[missiles, and]{.mark} experimenting with [maneuverable reentry
vehicles]{.mark}. It [could]{.mark} also [pursue]{.mark}]{.underline}
the development of [[decoys]{.mark} and countermeasures
[specifically]{.mark} designed [to fool]{.mark} U.S. [missile
defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. While imperfect defenses might be able to
limit damage against conventionally armed missiles, [[the
devastation]{.mark} that would result [from even one]{.mark} nuclear
[weapon]{.mark} landing [on]{.mark}]{.underline} Seoul or [[Guam gives
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [a significant deterrent]{.mark}
capability]{.underline}. And it wouldn't even need to come to this:
North Korea possesses hundreds of artillery pieces that hold Seoul at
risk and against which the United States and South Korea have no
defense.

Indeed, [[Pyongyang is]{.mark} much [more likely]{.mark} to [be
deterred]{.mark} from using its nuclear-tipped missiles [by the sure
knowledge]{.mark} that [the U.S.]{.mark} military [response would
bring]{.mark} the [Kim]{.mark} regime [to a bloody end]{.mark} than by
the prospect that some of its missiles might be
intercepted.]{.underline}

U.S. military officials have been increasingly vocal in recent years
about the [difficulty of [keeping pace with]{.mark} adversary [missile
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}, noting repeatedly that the [current

**McCallion 24**, MS @ the London School of Economics and Political
Science, fellow at Defense Priorities. (Christopher, 5-23-2024, \"Grand
Strategy: Geography,\" Defense Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/grand-strategy-geography/)

[[The folly of]{.mark} pursuing]{.underline} global
[[heg]{.underline}]{.mark}emony

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fundamental logic of U.S.
grand strategy changed. Rather than seeking to maintain a balance of
power in Eurasia, the United States endeavored to preserve its post-Cold
War position of military primacy and to establish its hegemony on a
global scale.29 The United States expanded its military commitments in
Europe and Asia and established a new presence onshore in the Middle
East, the latter leading to a string of ill-fated wars to reshape the
region according to U.S. policymakers' designs.30

The United States' post-Cold War grand strategy leaned heavily on the
assumption that U.S. technological supremacy (the "revolution in
military affairs") would allow it to occupy territory and populations in
faraway parts of the world, without having to commit the resources that
distant military endeavors normally demanded.31 To the extent that
distance still blunted power projection, so it was argued, the United
States would need to rely on its global archipelago of forward military
bases.32 But even with unprecedented capabilities, the United States was
forced to confront the limits of its military power. The [[post-9/11
wars]{.mark} in the Mid]{.underline}dle [East
[proved]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [[not only costly but
fruitless]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[thwarted by]{.mark} some of
[the]{.mark} [least wealthy]{.mark}]{.underline} and powerful
[[societies on the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}.33 Indeed,
[the]{.underline} relative [costs of wars in the periphery seem to have
risen conspicuously]{.underline} in recent decades.34

There are at least two salient reasons why [[U.S.
military]{.underline}]{.mark}-technological [[supremacy failed to
overcome geography]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first is that
[[advances]{.mark} and diffusion [of military
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[benefit defense]{.mark} as well as
offense]{.underline}, [with the balance favoring the former the
[more]{.mark} distance increases]{.underline}. [The second is the
durability of]{.underline} local political-cultural identification,
which as a shorthand can be called "[nationalism]{.underline}."
[[Nationalism creates asymmetry between]{.mark} the [interests
of]{.mark} local [populations]{.mark},]{.underline} on the one hand,
[[and]{.mark} the far more tenuous interests of [the]{.mark} distant
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates in their
affairs, on the other.

[The]{.underline} "[strategic distance]{.underline}" [over which the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must project power has
grown]{.underline}. Far more formidable than the Taliban or Iraqi
insurgents, great or [[regional powers]{.mark} like China, Russia, and
Iran [can counter the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[at]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}er [[cost]{.mark} in their own
backyards]{.underline}, altering the costs and risks ratio for the
United States to intervene in a local contingency. This is
[especially]{.underline} true [if U.S. interests are conditional enough
for it to not commit the full weight of its national
resources]{.underline} to the fight. The United States' grand strategy
should be recalibrated to reflect a more rigorously prioritized set of
interests and more modest expectations regarding the political outcomes
that can be achieved by the use of U.S. military power abroad.

**No impact: alternative explanations for stability outweigh, and
proponents of heg are [cognitively biased]{.underline} to exaggerate its
importance**

**Fettweis 20**, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University. (Christopher J., 6-3-2020, \"Delusions of Danger:
Geopolitical Fear and Indispensability in U.S. Foreign Policy\", *A
Dangerous World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security*,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/delusions-danger-geopolitical-fear-indispensability-us-foreign-policy>)

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on faith alone]{.underline}.41 [There is precious little
evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [[the world remained equally
peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark}, relatively speaking, [[while the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cut]{.mark}
its [forces throughout the]{.mark} 19[90s]{.mark}, as well as while it
doubled its military spending in the first decade of the new
century]{.underline}.42 [[Complex statistical
methods]{.underline}]{.mark} should not be needed to
[[demonstrate]{.mark} that levels of U.S. military [spending have
been]{.mark} essentially [unrelated to]{.mark} global
[stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple
correlations to support them, however. [The theory's supporters have
never been able to explain adequately how precisely 5 percent of the
world's population could force peace on the other 95
percent]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. [Most states are quite free to go to war
without U.S. involvement but choose not to]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially
after Iraq, to steer well clear of most civil wars and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of [Africa]{.mark} would be unlikely to
attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
intervention]{.underline}. [The continent [is]{.mark}, nevertheless,
more [peaceful]{.mark} today than at any other time in its
history]{.underline}, [[something for which]{.mark} U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony [cannot take credit]{.mark}]{.underline}.43
[[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in many]{.mark} such [places to
which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony simply [does not
extend.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Overall, [[proponents]{.mark} of the stabilizing power of U.S. hegemony
[should keep in mind]{.mark} one of the most basic observations from
cognitive [psychology]{.mark}]{.underline}: [rarely are our actions as
important to others' calculations as we perceive them to
be]{.underline}.44 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} so‐​called [[egocentric
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [[suggests]{.mark} that although it may be natural for
[U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as crucial in the
maintenance of world peace, they are almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the myriad decisions in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is.]{.underline}

[The indispensability fallacy owes its existence to a couple of
factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to bask in the
reflected glory of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's) [unique,
nonpareil stature]{.underline}, [Americans have long been exceptional in
their exceptionalism]{.underline}.45 [The short history of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can easily be read as an
almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, [has led
to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it is morally,
culturally, and politically superior to other, lesser
countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional state
would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the world.

[Americans have always combined that feeling of divine providence with a
sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and battle
evil]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that sense of destiny, of
being the object of history's call, that most obviously separates the
United States from other countries. Only an American president would
claim that by entering World War I, "America had the infinite privilege
of fulfilling her destiny and saving the world."46

Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other
seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite
the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants everybody to
be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I believe. And
that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine Albright called
the United States the "indispensable nation," she was reflecting a
traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional
nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the
merely average.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility:
to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions.
More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend
to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and
power tends to blind states to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 [It is quite likely that the world does not need the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to enforce peace]{.underline}.
In fact, [if virtually any of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing
explanations for the current stability are correct, the trends in
international security may well prove difficult to reverse]{.underline}.
[[None of the contributing factors]{.mark} that are commonly
suggested]{.underline} ([economic development, [complex interdependence,
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, international [institutions]{.mark},
[democracy]{.mark}, shifting global [norms]{.mark} on war]{.underline})
[[seem poised to disappear]{.mark} any time soon]{.underline}.50 [[The
world will]{.mark} probably [continue its peaceful
ways]{.mark}]{.underline} for the near future, at the very least, [[no
matter what]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

[[Pax Americana is gone]{.underline}]{.mark}. Born with the Japanese

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The pres]{.underline}ident [has long
maintained]{.underline} that [this order disadvantages the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [by saddling it with the burden
of policing the globe and enabling its allies to play it for a
sucker]{.underline}. "[The postwar global order is not just
obsolete]{.underline}," Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared in his
Senate confirmation hearing. "[It is now a weapon]{.underline} being
used [against us]{.underline}."

[Trump's [skepticism about]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. support for
[[Ukraine and Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, his [[eagerness to impose
tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[threats
to retake]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark} Canal,
[[absorb Canada]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} acquire [Greenland]{.mark} make it
clear that he [envision]{.mark}s [a return to]{.mark} nineteenth-century
[power politics]{.mark}]{.underline} and spheres of interest, even if he
does not frame his foreign policy in those terms. In that era, [the
great powers of the day sought to divide the world into regions that
each would dominate]{.underline}, regardless of the desires of those who
lived there---a vision of the world that Trump explicitly echoes.
[[Trump sees few]{.underline}]{.mark} significant U.S. [[interests
outside the West]{.mark}ern Hemisphere, [considers
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [[a drain on
the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[Treasury]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
believes the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should dominate
its neighborhood]{.underline}. His is a Thucydidean worldview---one in
which "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."

Although the era of Pax Americana produced extraordinary
achievements---the deterrence of communism, unprecedented global
prosperity, relative peace---it also planted the seeds of its own
destruction well before Trump's ascent. [American hubris had led to
costly, humiliating wars]{.underline} in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[and]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline}--9 financial crisis [shattered
faith in the]{.underline} U.S. [government's competence and policy
prescriptions. One can understand why some Americans might feel their
country would fare better in a different, might-makes-right
world]{.underline}. The United States would seem to bring a strong hand
to such an order---it commands the world's largest economy, its most
capable military, and arguably its strongest geographic position.

But [it has a profoundly underrated disadvantage: lack of practice.
Naked power politics is alien terrain for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [but]{.underline} it is [familiar territory to
its]{.underline} current [rivals]{.underline}. Chinese President Xi
Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have long resented Pax
Americana because it limited their geopolitical ambitions. They have
learned to work together to counter U.S. influence, especially in the
global South. And unlike Trump, they do not face internal checks and
balances on their power. They could overplay their hands and generate a
backlash to their revisionist ambitions. But if they do not, Trump's
gamble could easily go awry, leaving Americans, and the rest of the
world, less prosperous and less secure.

DOMINATION OVER DIPLOMACY

As anomalous as Trump's rhetoric can sound to ears conditioned by
decades of bipartisan talk of the United States as the leader of the
free world, his foreign-policy vision---of expanding U.S. influence in
its immediate neighborhood while backing out of global
leadership---draws from older American impulses. In 1823, President
James Monroe famously declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to
further European colonization. By the end of the nineteenth century,
presidents would use Monroe's proclamation to justify U.S. territorial
expansion. In 1977, the United States agreed to relinquish control of
the Panama Canal only in the face of rising anti-Americanism in Latin
America and over the staunch opposition of Americans who believed, as
one U.S. senator put it, that "we stole it fair and square."

Indeed, Trump's coveting of Canada and Greenland also has roots in U.S.
history. The founding American generation harbored dreams of absorbing
Canada; writing at the start of the War of 1812, fought between the
United States and the United Kingdom, former President Thomas Jefferson
declared that "the acquisition of Canada this year . . . will be a mere
matter of marching." Such a desire persisted in cries of "54-40 or
fight" in the 1840s, a reference to the latitude of the southern border
of what was then Russian-owned Alaskan territory and to an appeal to
seize a large swath of Canada's Pacific Northwest. President James Polk
set aside this ambition in 1846 in favor of the current U.S.-Canadian
border only because he was reluctant to confront a more powerful United
Kingdom over a distant and largely uninhabited territory as war with
Mexico loomed. President Andrew Johnson considered purchasing Greenland
from Denmark when the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867,
and President Harry Truman, citing the island's strategic value,
secretly pitched the purchase once again in 1946.

Similar dreams of Manifest Destiny undergird Trump's inaugural-address
call for a foreign policy that "expands our territory." His goal to
increase Washington's sway in the Western Hemisphere does in fact have
some strategic logic. The Panama Canal is a vital sea route for U.S.
commerce. Roughly 40 percent of all U.S. container traffic passes
through the waterway, and nearly three-quarters of all containers
sailing through the canal originate in or are destined for the United
States. U.S. security would be endangered if another great power
controlled the canal. Greenland's strategic importance, meanwhile, has
grown alongside climate change---a phenomenon that Trump ironically
insists is not occurring. The melting of the Arctic ice cap will soon
create a new northern waterway, bringing additional military
vulnerabilities to northern North America. Greenland also boasts large
reserves of the critical minerals that the United States needs for clean
energy technologies. And making Canada the 51st state would eliminate
trade barriers between the two countries, in theory reducing economic
inefficiencies and potentially enriching people on both sides of the
border.

Washington, however, has already achieved many of these strategic
objectives without resorting to threats. Panama's president, José Raúl
Molino, successfully campaigned on promises to build closer ties with
the United States. As an autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland is
covered by NATO's Article 5, meaning that it falls under the
organization's security umbrella. The island hosts the U.S. military's
northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule
Air Base. Greenlanders have proved eager to solicit American rather than
Chinese investment in their economy. And the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term, has already
encouraged economic integration between the United States and Canada.
The agreement's 2026 review provides an opportunity to deepen that
cooperation. Yet such diplomatic tools---forging alliances and creating
collective security and trade agreements---are hallmarks of the world
order that Trump has now abandoned.

THE PUTIN-XI PLAYBOOK

[It is clear whose approach Trump seeks to emulate instead. He considers
Putin and Xi his peers]{.underline}, not allied leaders such as Japan's
Shigeru Ishiba, France's Emmanuel Macron, or the United Kingdom's Keir
Starmer. [[Trump]{.mark} regularly [denounces]{.mark} these
[allies]{.mark} for taking advantage of U.S. largess, [but]{.mark} he
has [hailed Putin]{.mark} as]{.underline} "[savvy]{.underline},"
"strong," [and]{.underline} "[a genius]{.underline}" for invading
Ukraine [[and Xi]{.mark} for being]{.underline} "exceptionally
[brilliant]{.underline}" [in controlling Chinese citizens with an "iron
fist." In his praise]{.underline} for these autocrats, [Trump reveals
his]{.underline} singular [admiration for leaders who wield power
without constraint]{.underline}---[even those who are actively hostile
to U.S. interests.]{.underline}

[Trump]{.underline}, moreover, [appears comfortable with ceding
spheres]{.underline} of influence [to China and Russia]{.underline} if
they return the favor. [[He]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[blamed]{.underline}]{.mark} Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[[Zelensky]{.underline}]{.mark}, not Putin, [[for]{.mark} the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and he favors resolving the Ukraine war
with an agreement that cedes Ukrainian territory to Russia and bars
Ukraine from joining NATO]{.underline}. Asked in 2021 whether the United
States should defend Taiwan militarily, Trump answered that if China
invades the island, "there isn't a fucking thing we can do about it."
And [Trump is comfortable with downgrading postwar
alliances]{.underline} that extend into supposed Russian and Chinese
spheres of interest. [He]{.underline} has, for instance, repeatedly
[[questioned]{.underline}]{.mark} the value of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} (whose expansion he blames for triggering
Russia's invasion of Ukraine) [[and threatened to
withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. troops [[from
So]{.underline}]{.mark}uth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea. He views such
alliances as bad investments that saddle the United States with the cost
of protecting countries that, to add insult to injury, also steal jobs
from Americans.

Like Putin and Xi, [Trump]{.underline} also [believes]{.underline} that
[economic power should be used as a lever to extract concessions from
countries that displease him.]{.underline} Just as Putin has used
Russia's oil and gas to intimidate Europe and Xi has manipulated China's
exports and imports to coerce countries such as Australia and Japan,
Trump favors using tariffs to force both domestic and foreign
corporations to relocate production to the United States.
[Trump]{.underline} also [sees tariffs as instruments to compel foreign
capitals to bend to his will on other issues]{.underline}. Mexico, for
instance, now faces the prospect of higher tariffs should it fail to
meet Trump's demands to stop the flow of migrants and fentanyl across
the United States' southern border. He has threatened to use "economic
force" to annex Canada. He has warned Denmark that it will face higher
tariffs if it refuses to sell Greenland. And just this week, he
threatened to impose tariffs on Colombia for its refusal to accept
military flights deporting its nationals from the United States. The
creators of the postwar global order believed high tariffs only fueled
destructive economic nationalism and conflict. [[Trump's threats
mark]{.mark} the dawn of [a]{.mark} more [openly coercive order in which
economic intimidation replaces]{.mark} free [trade and]{.mark}
international [coop]{.mark}eration as a currency of power.]{.underline}

PLAYING A LOSING HAND

Trump's approach may yield some successes. Canada and Mexico may agree
to do more, at least symbolically, to secure their borders. The leaders
of U.S. allies will visit Washington---or Mar-a-Lago---to trumpet their
desire to work with Trump's America.

But [the]{.underline} United States' [return to nineteenth-century power
politics will likely not yield the bonanza that Trump has
promised]{.underline}. Until now, Washington's network of
[alliances]{.underline} has [granted the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [extraordinary influence in Europe and
Asia]{.underline}, imposing constraints on Moscow and Beijing at a scale
that neither power can replicate. [Ceding that advantage will come at
great cost to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates: not only
will erstwhile U.S. allies no longer follow Washington's lead, but many
could also seek safety by aligning themselves more closely with Russia
and China instead.

The United States may face similar setbacks on the trade front. As
Elizabeth Economy and Melanie Hart noted in Foreign Affairs in January,
U.S. producers are already at a growing competitive disadvantage
exporting to the 12 members of the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the accord negotiated in the
wake of Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. The door for the United States to join CPTPP,
which has remained ajar, may soon close. But it could open for China,
potentially giving Beijing a say over the standards and rules that
govern a wide swath of the global economy. During Trump's first term,
the European Union signed major trade agreements with Canada and Japan.
It has just concluded new and upgraded agreements with Mexico and
countries in South America, and it is finalizing deals with Australia
and Indonesia. Trump's willingness to slap tariffs on countries that
defy him will only encourage foreign leaders to look elsewhere for trade
opportunities and lock U.S. producers out of global markets.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could]{.underline} also
[fail at naked power politics simply because China and Russia may be
better at it]{.underline}. [[Beijing and Moscow]{.mark} have not
hesitated to [inflame the world's resentment of
America]{.mark}]{.underline}, emphasizing the United States' purported
hypocrisy for prioritizing Ukraine as conflicts rage elsewhere and for
ignoring the high civilian casualties incurred in Israel's war in Gaza.
[[Those efforts will]{.mark} likely [ramp up as Trump turns to
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to pressure friends and neighbors; as a
result, [Washington will almost surely lose some ability to attract
support]{.underline}. China is especially well positioned to contest
U.S. influence across the globe, including in the United States' own
backyard. [[Trump does not offer]{.underline}]{.mark} other countries
new [[opportunities]{.mark}; [he demands
concessions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Beijing, by contrast, is eager to do
business around the world]{.underline} with its Belt and Road
infrastructure initiative; it invests with few immediate conditions,
[and it speaks the language of win-win outcomes]{.underline}. Chinese
firms also often offer competitive products at better prices than U.S.
companies do. Unsurprisingly, China has already become the number one
trading partner for many countries in the global South. And as
Washington withdraws from international institutions such as the World
Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, Beijing is swiftly
moving to fill the vacuum.

The United States' political system also puts Trump at a disadvantage.
Both China and Russia exercise near-complete control over their
populations, using fear, surveillance, and repression to keep citizens
in line. As a result, both countries can pursue policies that inflict
great pain on their publics: Putin, for instance, has conducted his
"special military operation" in Ukraine despite netting his country
casualties that reportedly run more than three-quarters of a million.
However hard he tries, Trump cannot command such power over the American
people. Indeed, any efforts to do so will invite a backlash. U.S.
society is also vulnerable to foreign influence campaigns through social
and other media channels in ways that the more controlled Chinese and
Russian societies are not. Should Trump's policies meet large-scale
domestic resistance, he may learn what the Vietnam War taught Presidents
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon: strong domestic opposition weakens the
credibility of a president's threats and gives rivals reason to believe
they can outlast Washington.

TRUMP'S GAMBLE

How the United States will fare in a dog-eat-dog world also depends, of
course, on decisions made elsewhere. Putin and Xi's shared conviction
that they are now driving change on a global scale may breed hubris and
cause them to misstep. China's heavy-handed "wolf warrior" diplomacy and
Russia's decision to invade Ukraine, for instance, bolstered Biden's
effort to rebuild U.S. alliances. Other countries might resent the
United States, but many of them fear China and Russia in ways that could
work to Washington's advantage.

What the United States' [[Asian and European allies]{.underline}]{.mark}
do also matters. These countries [[will]{.mark} be tempted [to try to
please Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether by showering him with praise,
feting him with state visits, or offering preemptive concessions such as
purchasing more American-made goods. Those efforts, however, will not
endear them to him. [Trump will happily pocket those wins and see them
as vindication of his might-makes-right approach. [But he will not take
up the]{.mark} United States' old [mantle of]{.mark} global
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To earn Trump's respect, U.S. allies must demonstrate strength. Whether
they have the capacity to do so is an open question. First, they must
recognize that [the era of Pax Americana is over and the era of power
politics has returned]{.underline}. The one thing Trump understands is
power---and if U.S. allies work together, they can confront him with
plenty of their own. If they succeed in mobilizing their resources
collectively, they may also be able to blunt some of Trump's worst
foreign-policy impulses. That may in turn create the opportunity down
the road to forge a new global order that matches Pax Americana's record
for peace and prosperity. But if they fail, a darker era of unchecked
power politics awaits---one that is less prosperous and more dangerous
for all.

#### Trump's economic [war on allies]{.underline} was \[and is\] a [death blow]{.underline} to leadership. 

**Miller 25**, MA International Affairs, Director of Foreign Affairs,
National Security, and Defense @ the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in
Ottawa. (Jonathan Berkshire, 2-5-2025, \"Canada Is Merely First in

The pause is good news, especially for Canadians, who would have
suffered immediate economic harm had Trump followed through. But in
other ways, [[the damage is]{.mark} already [done]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Trump's decision to penalize]{.mark} a neighbor]{.underline}, [[an
ally]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and one of the closest economic partners of
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in a manner]{.underline}
more commonly [reserved for adversaries is an unprecedented move that
[signals a fundamental shift]{.mark} in Washington's approach to
alliances. The treatment he has doled out to [Canada is a harbinger of
what is to come]{.mark} for U.S. allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline}.
In recent days, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[chastised
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} for its trade surplus with the United States
[[and warned the E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion that [[tariffs could
be]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[coming]{.mark} soon]{.underline}."

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration[['s]{.mark} doctrine of
[brute-force]{.mark} economic [coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}---executed
[through tariffs]{.underline}, executive orders, [and the wielding
of]{.underline} Washington's [financial
hegemony]{.underline}---[[threatens]{.mark} to transform [transatlantic
and Indo-Pacific relationships]{.mark} into almost purely transactional
affairs]{.underline}. [The results will hurt everyone
involved]{.underline}---[and help]{.underline} American adversaries such
as [China and Russia]{.underline}. In the short term, the most pragmatic
approach for Canada (and other U.S. allies, as their turns come) is to
respond to Trump's threats in a calibrated and clear-headed manner. This
is easier said than done, however, as [domestic politics often
incentivize responses driven by pride or nationalism]{.underline}.
Canadians and others must resist the temptation to lash out.
Countermoves and retaliation are necessary, but overreactions will only
hurt Canada's economic and security interests in the long run.

TRANSACTION MAN

[Trump's approach to foreign policy is rooted in a zero-sum, dealmaking
mentality]{.underline}, in which economic leverage represents the
primary tool of statecraft. [Traditional diplomacy and alliance
management are relegated to the sidelines in favor of an aggressive,
protectionist agenda that prioritizes immediate economic gains over
long-term]{.underline} strategic [stability]{.underline}. Although many
American allies have become accustomed to criticism from Washington over
trade imbalances and defense spending, [Trump is the first U.S.
president in the contemporary era to translate those grievances into
direct economic warfare against partners]{.underline}---using weapons
generally reserved for Washington's foes.

[Trump's rhetoric makes clear]{.underline} that [his
admin]{.underline}istration [views all economic relationships, including
those with allies, as inherently adversarial]{.underline}, requiring
constant renegotiation under the threat of financial penalties.
[[This]{.mark} approach [creates uncertainty]{.mark} among U.S. partners
and raises concerns]{.underline} that [[Washington's commitment
to]{.underline}]{.mark} collective [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} and
economic cooperation [[is contingent on]{.mark} short-term
[transactional benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's defenders argue
that his approach is necessary to address trade imbalances and force
allies to take their security commitments more seriously. But the
long-term consequences of his economic belligerence have been largely
negative for all involved. Steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump
administration placed on Canada in 2018, for example, prompted
retaliatory measures that harmed American businesses and consumers while
failing to yield significant strategic gains.

The fallout, however, goes far beyond the bottom line. [Carrying out
[economic war]{.mark}]{.underline}fare [[on allies sows distrust and
risks fracturing]{.mark} the [transatlantic and Indo-Pacific security
architectures]{.mark} that have underpinned global
stability]{.underline} for decades. [If Washington imposes
[tariffs]{.mark} on European and Asian allies, it will [create a
wedge]{.mark} that [adversaries]{.mark} such as China and Russia
[will]{.mark} eagerly [exploit]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[is seeking to]{.mark}
drive a deeper [divide]{.mark} between [the U.S. and Europe by
presenting itself as]{.mark} a [more reliable]{.mark} economic
partner]{.underline}. For its part, [[Moscow is capitalizing]{.mark} on
transatlantic tensions [to weaken NATO]{.mark} cohesion]{.underline}.
The growing strategic partnership between these two authoritarian
powers---cemented through military cooperation, economic agreements, and
shared hostility toward the West---represents a direct challenge to the
U.S.-led global order. [By undermining trust with allies through
indiscriminate economic aggression, Washington risks isolating itself at
a time when maintaining]{.underline} strong, unified [alliances is more
critical than ever.]{.underline}

[The episode with Colombia was far from]{.underline} an
[isolated]{.underline} one, however. It was also reported this week that
[Trump had a "fiery" exchange with Danish P]{.underline}rime
[M]{.underline}inister Mette [Frederiksen [over]{.mark} the
acquisition]{.underline} by the U.S. [of]{.underline} the island of
[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, a move Trump first raised back in 2019
but on which he has seemingly become fixated since winning the U.S.
presidential election in November. Once [again]{.underline}, [[Trump
threatened sanctions]{.mark} if the U.S. doesn't get its
way]{.underline}. When [[combined with]{.mark} Trump [pulling]{.mark}
the U.S. [out of the W]{.mark}]{.underline}orld
[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}ealth [[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rganization,
signing an executive order [[freezing all foreign
aid]{.underline}]{.mark} and appointing a secretary of defense who calls
for restoring a "warrior ethos" to the U.S. military, [[it's no
wonder]{.mark} that [many see Trump taking]{.mark} U.S. foreign [policy
in a darker]{.mark}, more coercive [direction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump has long been seen as transactional and a dealmaker. While such
behavior was evident during his first term, it seems heightened this
time around. [The demands are now more coercive, almost
predatory]{.underline}.

International relations scholars often make a distinction between
benevolent versus malevolent, or cooperative versus coercive hegemons.
Benevolent hegemons provide public goods willingly. Malevolent or
predatory hegemons are at best merely transactional, at worst entirely
self-serving and oppressive. If the United States is still the most
important country in the international system---that is, if it is still
the hegemon---then can the current international order survive having a
predatory hegemon at its center?

The truth is that no powerful state, hegemonic states included, is
purely located at one extreme of the spectrum, whether completely
benevolent or predatory. Every major power, just like any state in the
international system, is more self-serving than selfless. U.S. history
is full of examples of Washington being more coercive than cooperative,
even in the time since it began supporting the so-called liberal
international order and even toward its staunchest allies in that order.
To put it bluntly, the U.S. has always been a bit of a jerk. As
international relations scholar and South Asia specialist Paul Staniland
wrote during Trump's first term, those who fear a decline of the liberal
international order and worry about a more coercive direction of foreign
policy under Trump "often present a narrow and highly selective reading
of history that ignores much of the coercion, violence, and instability
that accompanied post-war history."

But in the apocryphal words of Winston Churchill, for all its flaws, the
U.S. could always be counted on to do the right thing---after exhausting
all other options. The worry is that even this small comfort is no
longer in play. The U.S. under Trump appears bent on fully leveraging
its outsized position within the world's trade, security and financial
networks to coerce better deals. If others don't like it, they won't
even be given the dignity of a kind word. The U.S., in Trump's view, has
been played for a sucker, and he's determined to change all that.

But if Trump takes the U.S. into full predatory mode, abandoning even
the façade of paying lip service to the liberal international order,
should the world worry?

After all, [despite Trump's coercive behavior during his first term, the
U.S. alliance structure remained largely intact.]{.underline} That was
in part because Trump saw some value in maintaining ties with some U.S.
allies, but also because those allies actively catered to Trump and his
whims.

If this continues into Trump's second term, it will not be because the
U.S. under Trump continues to protect the vulnerable, whether at home or
abroad. Instead, it will be because [[Trump's transactional instinct is
married with a desire to return the U.S. to a time where it was]{.mark}
largely [left alone]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The U.S. under Trump will be
a predatory hegemon that lacks hegemonic ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It will be a coercive power that is inclined to renegotiate the terms of
a deal rather than wield military force to get its way. Outside the
parameters of those negotiations, however, there won't be much reason to
fear the United States. But there won't be much reason to respect it
either.

There is another factor that could possibly drive the U.S. under Trump
toward taking on a constructive role in order maintenance, even
peace-building: Trump's personal desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize,
which would make him only the sixth U.S. president or vice president to
be awarded the prize. While it is unlikely that the committee thinks of
him as a leading contender, Trump might do all he can to leave them no
choice, whether it is brokering a settlement between Ukraine and Russia,
extending the Abraham Accords so that Israel and Saudi Arabia normalize
relations or finally reaching a long-sought-after nuclear deal with
North Korea. Indeed, this desire may well explain the tone, tenor and
content of Trump's address to those gathered at the World Economic Forum
in Davos last week, in which he called for cooperation in bringing about
the end to conflicts, especially the war between Ukraine and Russia.

Some might question whether the U.S. is still the world's hegemonic
power, or the key country that can shape and alter the course of
international politics. If it's not, then Trump's behavior, while
concerning, can be dismissed as the flailing of a declining power. But
even if the U.S. is not still hegemonic, much of the world---be it
nations of the Western Hemisphere residing directly in the U.S. orbit,
the network of allies that rely on U.S. protection or the international
institutions that rely on U.S. support to function---still view the U.S.
as the central actor in the world. Moreover, the U.S. remains, as I
wrote in a previous column, "one of the few countries in the world with
the power and resources to largely shape world politics in a manner that
serves its interests. It would seem to be a wasted opportunity not to."

But the question is not only whether the U.S. has the willingness and
confidence to exercise that power, but how a state as powerful as the
U.S. should do so.

It is well-known that [[Trump disdains the]{.mark} idea of a
"[rules-based]{.mark}" or "liberal international" [order]{.mark}. He
doesn't see value in maintaining rules, institutions or customs for
their own sake or even for the sake of habit and
predictability]{.underline}. Indeed, [[he thrives in being
unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}. He also thrives in being highly
transactional. [This will tilt the U.S. toward being]{.underline} more
[a predatory hegemon]{.underline} in the coming years, one [that
destabilizes and disturbs more than it comforts]{.underline}. But it
also won't be fully outside the bounds of how the U.S. was long
perceived by others.

The amount of retaliatory damage the United States must be able to

[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} in the first place. Fortunately, [[there
are no]{.mark} obvious [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although [popular

Whatever the stakes for China, [the United States would be able to

**No prolif\-\--EVEN IF, no impact.**

**Mueller 20**, PhD, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, member of the
political science department and senior research scientist with the
Mershon Center for International Security Studies at Ohio State
University. (John, 6-24-2020, "Nuclear Alarmism: Proliferation and
Terrorism," Cato Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/nuclear-alarmism-proliferation-terrorism>)

Nuclear Proliferation

In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that "no new nuclear
weapons states" should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst
Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation
should be "our number one national‐​security priority."5

[[There are]{.mark} good [reasons to avoid alarmism]{.mark}]{.underline}
in this area, however. First, [the pace of nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration [has been]{.mark} far [slow]{.mark}er than has
been commonly predicted primarily because the [weapons convey little
advantage]{.mark} to their possessor]{.underline}. Second, [the
consequences of such [prolif]{.mark}eration that [has]{.mark} taken
place have [been]{.mark} substantially [benign]{.mark}]{.underline}:
[those who have acquired the weapons have "used" them simply to stoke
their egos or to deter]{.underline} real or imagined
[threats]{.underline}.6

And thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very
substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of
dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six
figures.

Pace

Alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear
proliferation. [[Dozens of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries
have considered]{.mark} obtaining nuclear [arsenals, but very few have
done so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed out,
even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have
proved to be too pessimistic.7 Thus, in 1958, the National Planning
Association predicted "a rapid rise in the number of atomic powers ...
by the mid‐​1960s."8 A few years later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted,
"Within, at the most, six years, China and several other states \[will\]
have a stock of nuclear bombs," and John Kennedy observed that there
might be "ten, fifteen, twenty" countries with a nuclear capacity by
1964.9

As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that nuclear
weapons would be important status --- or virility --- symbols;
therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to
show how "powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the
1960s, "No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.11 [Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits
insist on extrapolating from the wrong cases]{.underline}. A more
pertinent prototype would have been [Canada]{.underline}, a country that
[could]{.underline} easily [have had nuclear weapons by the 1960s but
declined to make the effort]{.underline}.12 In fact, over the decades,
[[a huge number]{.mark} of countries capable of developing nuclear
weapons have [neglected even to consider the opportunity]{.mark} --- for
example, Canada, Italy, and Norway --- even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya,
South Korea, and Taiwan have backed away from or reversed nuclear
weapons programs, and Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine
have actually surrendered or dismantled an existing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}.13 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the
hostility of the nuclear nations, but even without that, the Canadian
case seems to have proved to have rather general relevance.

To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [there is no "technological
imperative" for countries to obtain nuclear weapons]{.underline} once
they have achieved the technical capacity to do so.14 Moreover, like
military prowess in general, [the weapons have not proved to be crucial
status symbols]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis has observed, "India,
China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack by
developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have
increased their general prestige or influence."15 How much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? [Would anybody pay a
great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held
5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had none?
Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic
growth?]{.underline} Or with its Olympics? As Jennifer Mackby and Walter
Slocombe observe, "[Germany, like]{.underline} its erstwhile Axis ally,
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [has become powerful because of its
economic might rather than its military might]{.underline}, [and its
[renunciation of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} may even have
[reinforced]{.mark} its [prestige]{.mark}]{.underline}."16

[[Decades of]{.mark} alarmist [predictions about]{.mark} proliferation
chains, [cascades]{.mark}, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and
points of no return [have proved]{.mark} to be [faulty]{.mark}. The
[proli]{.mark}feration of nuclear weapons [has been]{.mark} far
[slow]{.mark}er than routinely expected because, insofar as most
[leaders]{.mark} of most countries]{.underline} ([even rogue
ones]{.underline}) have [considered acquiring the weapons, they have
come to [appreciate]{.mark} several defects]{.underline}: [the [weapons
are dangerous]{.mark}, distasteful, [costly, and]{.mark} likely to [rile
the neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, as Jacques Hymans has
demonstrated, [the [weapons have]{.mark} also [been]{.mark} [exceedingly
difficult to obtain]{.mark} for administratively dysfunctional countries
like Iran]{.underline}.17

Consequences

Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during
which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in
nuclear proliferation, [the consequences of the proliferation that has
occurred have been substantially benign]{.underline}. [The few
[countries]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} the weapons [have proliferated have
quietly kept them in storage]{.mark}]{.underline} [and haven't even
found much benefit in rattling them from time to time]{.underline}. And
[even the deterrence value of the weapons has been
questionable]{.underline} --- [the major Cold War
participants]{.underline}, for example, [scarcely needed visions of
mushroom clouds to conclude that any replication of World War
II]{.underline}, with or without nuclear weapons, [was a decidedly bad
idea]{.underline}.18

Moreover, [[there has never been a]{.mark} militarily
[compelling]{.mark}]{.underline} --- or even minimally sensible ---
[[reason]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to use the weapons]{.underline}]{.mark},
[particularly because of an inability to identify suitable
targets]{.underline} or ones that could not be attacked about as
[effectively]{.underline} by conventional munitions. And [it is
difficult to see how nuclear weapons benefited their possessors in
specific military ventures. Israel's]{.underline} presumed [nuclear
weapons did not restrain the Arabs from attacking in 1973]{.underline},
nor did Britain's prevent Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982.
Similarly, the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of
the enveloping allied forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his
occupying forces out of Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb
benefit America in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in
Algeria; or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.

[Proliferation [alarmists]{.mark} may occasionally grant that countries
principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter]{.underline} real or
[perceived threats. But many go on to [argue]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
newly [nuclear country will]{.mark} then [use]{.mark} its
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s to dominate the area]{.mark}]{.underline}.
That argument was repeatedly used with dramatic urgency for the dangers
supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is now being applied to Iran.

[Exactly how that domination business is to be carried out is never made
clear]{.underline}.19 But [the notion apparently is that [should an
atomic]{.mark} Iraq]{.underline} (in earlier fantasies) [or North Korea
or [Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} (in present ones) [[rattle]{.mark} the
occasional rocket]{.underline}, [[other countries]{.mark} in the
area,]{.underline} suitably intimidated, [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
supinely [[bow to its demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Far more
likely]{.mark}, any [threatened states will make common]{.mark} cause
with each other [and]{.mark} with other concerned countries against the
threatening neighbor. It]{.underline} thus [seems overwhelmingly likely
that if a nuclear Iran brandishes its weapons]{.underline} to intimidate
others or to get its way, [it will find that those threatened, rather
than capitulating]{.underline} to its blandishments [or rushing off to
build a compensating arsenal of their own]{.underline}, [will [ally with
others]{.mark}]{.underline} ([including conceivably Israel]{.underline})
[[to stand up to the intimidation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- rather in the
way they coalesced into an alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

[It is sometimes]{.underline} [said]{.underline}, or implied, [that
prolif]{.underline}eration [has had little consequence because the only
countries to possess nuclear weapons have had rational
leaders]{.underline}. [But the [weapons have proliferated to large,
important countries run by unchallenged monsters]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the time they acquired the bombs,
[[were]{.mark}]{.underline} certifiably

[[Stalin]{.underline}]{.mark}, who in 1949 was planning to change the

an artificial famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.20
[It is incumbent on those who strongly oppose an Iranian bomb to
demonstrate that the regime there is daffier than these.]{.underline}\
[The few [countries]{.mark} to have [acquired nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} programs seem to have done so sometimes [as an ego
trip]{.mark} for current leaders and]{.underline}, more urgently (or
perhaps merely in addition), [as an effort to deter a potential
attack]{.underline} on themselves: [China]{.underline} [to deter the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and the Soviet Union,
[Israel]{.underline} [to deter various enemy nations]{.underline} in the
neighborhood, [India to deter China, Pakistan to deter India, and now
North Korea to deter the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and
maybe others.21 [Insofar as nuclear proliferation is a response to
perceived threat, it follows that one way to reduce the likelihood of

### AT: Taiwan !\-\--1NC

#### No impact to taking Taiwan\-\--China wouldn't be able to aggress elsewhere, and US power would remain strong to enforce democracy elsewhere. 

**Porter 21**, Professor of International Security, University of
Birmingham (Patrick Porter, December 2, 2021, "The United States Should
Not Defend Taiwan," National Review,
https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2021/12/20/the-united-states-should-not-defend-taiwan/)

Attacking and [[occupying Taiwan]{.mark} would [not]{.mark}]{.underline}
just [[enlarge China's power but consume it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
under optimal circumstances, [amphibious [invasions]{.mark}]{.underline}
and opposed landings [[are difficult]{.mark} tasks]{.underline}.
Estimates vary. Still, according to the U.S. Department of Defense in
its latest assessment, [an attempt to invade Taiwan
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely ["[strain]{.mark}" the [PRC's]{.mark}
armed [forces, inflicting]{.mark}]{.underline} "combat [force
[attrition]{.mark}." [Even in]{.mark}]{.underline} the event of [a
[successful landing]{.mark}]{.underline} and breakout, [it
would]{.underline} possibly [[present]{.underline}]{.mark} added
[problems of "[urban warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} and
counterinsurgency." And [by [swallowing Taiwan]{.mark}, China [would
acquire a]{.mark} demanding [problem]{.mark}. [Holding down]{.mark} its
new [subjects]{.mark} under surveillance [would
divert]{.mark}]{.underline} manpower, [[resources, and
time]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even the great economic prize of conquest,
Taiwan's semiconductor foundries, would be disrupted, dependent as they
are on intellectual property, machinery, chemicals, and custom supplied
by the U.S. and allied firms. [[Recovering]{.mark} from all this would
[hardly leave Beijing spring-loaded for]{.mark} fresh military
[adventures]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The military advantages of capturing Taiwan would be substantial but
not game-changing]{.underline}. It would allow the PLA to base sensors
and air-defense systems on the eastern side of the island, extending the
effective vision of China's air-defense network farther into the
Pacific. Access to Taiwan's ports and airfields would improve the PLA's
anti-submarine coverage, and possession of the island would allow more
access to the open ocean for PLA navy submarines.

Yet [[barriers]{.mark} to China [remain]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
combination of [[distance]{.mark}, water, [and access-denial]{.mark}
military technology enables countries to [raise the
costs]{.mark}]{.underline} and blunt the progress of any interloper.
Taiwan is not the equivalent of Nazi-controlled Czechoslovakia in 1939,
in a contiguous, continental Europe ripe for expansion and containing
ideologically sympathetic partners. [It is a maritime, nuclear
environment of forbidding geography]{.underline}, defined more by sea
denial than sea control. As a conqueror's platform, [Taiwan may be an
"unsinkable aircraft carrier." It is also]{.underline}, still, [an
immobile one, its bases and ports in the crosshairs just as much as
neighboring countries]{.underline}.

B. Democracy and Representation

[[Dem]{.mark}ocratically elected governments [have been]{.mark} largely
[ineffective]{.mark} in [addressing climate]{.mark} change[, as well as
a]{.mark} host of other global problems and their domestic
implications]{.underline}. 38 [These include]{.underline} (to varying
degrees in different countries) [[pollution]{.mark} and
[biod]{.mark}iversity loss, nuclear [waste]{.mark} management, nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration, [cyber]{.mark}-(in)security, [financ]{.mark}ial
insecurity, business flight, growing wealth [inequality]{.mark}, public
[debt]{.mark} management, [migration]{.mark}, intercultural
[integration, and terror]{.mark}ist radicalization. The supranational
institutions that]{.underline} these [governments]{.underline} have
[created and supported, like the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [and]{.underline} the [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion, [have not been]{.underline} particularly
[successful]{.underline} in addressing these issues either. 39

[In]{.underline} many [democratic countries, [citizens
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[frustrated with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} relatively [[poor performances]{.mark} of]{.underline}
their [governments]{.underline}, but also increasingly resentful of
institutions and procedures that they perceive as inaccessible, arcane,
[[dominated by partisan interests]{.mark}, crowded with
[rent-seekers]{.mark}, and]{.underline} generally [[detached and
unresponsive]{.mark} to]{.underline} their [needs]{.underline} and
interests. 40

\[\*378\] A democratic deficit in many self-declared democracies has
vividly been put on display in cases in which [majority
[preferences]{.mark} have [failed to]{.mark} be [translate]{.mark}d
in[to policy]{.mark}. For example, in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [for at least the last twenty-five years,
most]{.underline} Americans have [favored stricter gun control laws,
yet]{.underline} gun control [laws have consistently been
weakened]{.underline}. 41 In Italy, the outcomes of many popular
referenda, including those regarding the introduction of legal liability
for magistrates (1985, 80.2% in favor) and the abolition of public
funding for political parties (1993, 90% in favor), have been ignored
either flatly or through artful reformulation of existing legislation.

#### No LIO impact: China [supports]{.underline} it, is a [structurally constrained]{.underline} power, and the US is [just as bad]{.underline}. 

**Swaine 21**, Director, Quincy Institute East Asia Program, Ph.D.,
Government, Harvard University (Michael Swaine, April 21, 2021, "China
Doesn't Pose an Existential Threat for America," Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/21/china-existential-threat-america/)

Finally, the latter set of supposedly existential normative or
ideological threats consists of many elements, including
[[Beijing's]{.mark} possible [overturning]{.mark} of [the]{.mark}
so-called global [l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}, Chinese influence operations aimed at U.S.
society, the export of China's political values and state-directed
economic approach, and its sale of surveillance technologies and other
items that facilitate the rise or strengthening of authoritarian states.
These threats all seem hair-raising at first glance. But while
significant, they [are [greatly exaggerated and]{.mark} do [not]{.mark}
rise to the level of constituting an [existential]{.mark}
threat]{.underline}.

[Beijing [has little interest in exporting]{.mark} its
[governance]{.mark} system]{.underline}, and where it does, it is almost
entirely directed at developing countries, not industrial democracies
such as the United States. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate
that the Chinese are actually engaged in compelling or actively
persuading countries to follow their experience. Rather, they want
developing nations to study from and copy China's approach because doing
so would help to legitimize the Chinese system both internationally and
more importantly to Beijing's domestic audience.

In addition, the notion that Beijing is deliberately attempting to
control other countries and make them more authoritarian by entrapping
them in debt and selling them "Big Brother" hardware such as
surveillance systems is unsupported by the facts. Chinese banks show
little desire to extend loans that will fail, and the failures that do
occur are mostly due to poor feasibility studies and the incompetence
and excessive zeal of lenders and/or borrowers. Moreover, in both
loan-giving and surveillance equipment sales, China has shown no
specific preference for nondemocratic over democratic states.

[[Even if Beijing were to]{.mark} attempt to export its]{.underline}
development [approach]{.underline} to other states, [[the]{.mark} actual
[attractiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} of that approach [[would
prove]{.mark} to be highly [limited]{.mark}. The
[features]{.mark}]{.underline} undergirding China's developmental
success [[are not replicable for]{.underline}]{.mark} most (if [any)
[countries]{.mark}. These [include]{.mark} a [high savings]{.mark}
rate]{.underline}; a highly acquisitive and entrepreneurial cultural
environment; a [[state]{.mark}-owned [banking]{.mark}]{.underline}
system [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} nonconvertible currency; many massive
[state-owned [industries]{.mark}]{.underline} that exist to provide
employment, facilitate [[party control over]{.mark} key
[sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}, and drive huge infrastructure
construction; [[and]{.mark} strong controls over virtually [all
information]{.mark}]{.underline} flows. Moreover, [[such]{.mark} a
model]{.underline} (if you can call it that) [[is]{.mark} almost
certainly [not sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline} in its present form,
[[given China's aging population]{.mark}, extensive
[corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}, very large levels of [income
[inequality]{.mark}, inadequate [social safety]{.mark} net]{.underline},
and the fact that free information flows are required to drive global
innovation.

Although [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} combination of economic reform
policies and [authoritarian political [system]{.mark} has [been around
since the]{.mark} early [1980s, no]{.mark}t a single [nation]{.mark} has
[adopted]{.mark} that system either willingly or under Chinese
compulsion]{.underline}. There are certainly many authoritarian states
and fragile democracies on China's periphery, but none of them were made
that way by China. [China's challenge to the so-called global liberal
international order is also exaggerated]{.underline}. In the first
place, it is highly debatable whether in fact a single coherent global
order even exists. What observers usually refer to as the "liberal
international order" (a relatively recent term) actually consists of an
amalgam of disparate regimes with different origins, including
international human rights pacts, multilateral economic arrangements,
and an international court.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} certainly plays an
important or leading role in many of these regimes. But it did not
create and does not drive all global regimes---and in fact [[does not
support]{.underline}]{.mark} some of them, such as [the
[I]{.mark}nternational [C]{.mark}ourt of [J]{.mark}ustice]{.underline},
and [has [not ratified]{.mark}]{.underline} some critical pacts such as
the [[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ational [C]{.mark}onvention on the
[L]{.mark}aw [o]{.mark}f the [S]{.mark}ea. And
[many]{.mark}]{.underline} very important global
[[regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., [[regarding]{.underline}]{.mark}
the proliferation of [[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction, [trade]{.mark}]{.underline} and investment,
[[climate]{.mark} change, [and pandemics]{.mark}) [have no]{.mark} deep
[connection to liberal]{.mark} democratic [values]{.mark} per se [and
are supported by Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit sometimes more in
letter than in spirit.

[[If China attacks Taiwan]{.mark}, there is little the United States
could do]{.underline} to reverse its fortunes short of fighting an
unreasonably costly and risky war on its behalf. [Instead]{.underline},
a prudent and politically feasible strategy is to pursue regional
deterrence and economic diversification. [The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [can deter]{.mark}]{.underline} the possibility of
[[further]{.mark} Chinese [aggression by]{.mark} temporarily
[surging]{.mark} U.S. [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} to the region [while
[prompting]{.mark} Asian [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Japan,
South Korea, and the Philippines, [[to invest in]{.mark} their
[own]{.mark} defense]{.underline} capabilities---[particularly
[anti-access]{.mark}]{.underline}, area-denial weaponry. Economically,
rather than imposing self-defeating sanctions and unrealistically
attempting to isolate China, the United States could leverage its [[vast
network]{.mark} of allies]{.underline} to lead an effort to diversify
[[global supply chains and decouple]{.underline}]{.mark} key critical
[[industries]{.mark}, such as semiconductors]{.underline}, 5G
telecommunication equipment, [artificial intelligence, and
other]{.underline} emerging digital [technologies]{.underline}.

As the global balance of power shifts, [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China will]{.mark}]{.underline} need to [[learn to
live with]{.mark} one [another]{.mark}. During the Cold
War]{.underline}, both [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}
the [Soviet Union]{.mark}]{.underline} committed armed aggression
against third-party states at the protest of the other power. Yet those
instances [[did not]{.mark} permanently [undermine]{.mark} diplomatic
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Forceful [reintegration of
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} into mainland China would be a disaster for
Taiwan---and perhaps China---but it [does [not]{.mark} need to [be a
disaster]{.mark}]{.underline} for the United States. Wise statecraft and
clear-eyed realism must be employed to ensure U.S. security and
prosperity, regardless of Taiwan's official political status.

### AT: Taiwan !\-\--China LIO\-\--2NC

#### No LIO impact\-\--the US is just as bad, China accepts broad order, and its worst impulses cannot be deterred. 

**Mueller 21**, Political Scientist, Ohio State University, Senior
Fellow, CATO Institute, quoting Yun Jiang, Researcher, Australian
National University (John Mueller, May 18, 2021, "China: Rise or
Demise?" CATO Policy Analysis, No. 917,
https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-05/policy-analysis-917.pdf)

Most importantly, [[Xi wants to overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} what he
and other [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} view as [past
[humiliations]{.mark}]{.underline}---ones going back to the opium war of
1839. Primarily, the Chinese want [to be treated with
respect]{.underline} and deference.186 That scarcely seems to present a
threat, and to a considerable degree, it seems sensible for other
countries, including the United States, to accept, and even service,
such vaporous and cosmetic goals. The United States, after all,
continually declares itself to be the one indispensable nation. If the
United States can wallow in such self-important, childish, essentially
meaningless, and decidedly fatuous proclamations, why should other
nations be denied the opportunity to emit similar inconsequential
rattlings? If China yearns for self-absorbed pretensions about being a
big player, that should be of little concern---and its success rate is
unlikely to be any better than that of the United States. A sardonic
crack by Yun Jiang, a researcher at the Australian National University,
may put the issue in perspective: ["[China wants what other]{.mark}
great [powers do]{.mark}. It wants [to follow]{.mark} international
[rules]{.mark} and norms [when]{.mark} it is [in its interest, and
disregard]{.mark} rules and norms [when]{.mark} the [circumstances suit
it]{.mark}."]{.underline}187

[However, [China]{.mark} actually [has]{.mark} had [a]{.mark} reasonably
[good record]{.mark} of [complying with]{.mark}]{.underline} complaints
brought against it in [the [W]{.mark}orld [T]{.mark}rade
[O]{.mark}rganization]{.underline}, a trajectory that can be encouraged
by wise policy.188 [It has [also]{.mark}]{.underline} abandoned
undervaluing its currency to boost growth while [[reducing its]{.mark}
weighted mean [tariff rate]{.mark}]{.underline} from 30 percent in 1992
to less than 4 percent in 2017.189 Notes Fingar, "In the early years,
acquiescence to the rules of [the [liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline}
was grudging at best, but [pragmatic]{.underline} as [[accommodation
became]{.mark} more [common]{.mark}]{.underline} as maintaining access
and relationships became ever more critical [[for China's]{.mark}
sustained [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . China is more prosperous,
more powerful, more influential. But it is also more deeply enmeshed in
and dependent on the rules-based international order, more vulnerable to
developments and decisions beyond its borders, and more constrained by
citizen expectations and demands."190 Suggests Ho-fung Hung, "[China is
[far from]{.mark} becoming [a subversive power]{.mark} that will
transform the existing neoliberal order [because China]{.mark} itself
[is one of the]{.mark} biggest [beneficiaries]{.mark} of this
order]{.underline}."191 Similarly, Shambaugh points out that:

[China [has become]{.mark} a [better]{.mark}]{.underline} "global
citizen" [[in]{.mark} almost [all areas of]{.mark} global
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (in many cases halting its previously
noncompliant behavior). China has become much more [deeply involved in
UN [peacekeeping]{.mark} operations]{.underline}, international
[disaster relief, [anti-piracy]{.mark}]{.underline} operations in the
Gulf of Aden, global [public health,
[c]{.mark}ounter[t]{.mark}errorism]{.underline}, law enforcement,
[[non-prolif]{.mark}eration, [climate]{.mark} change]{.underline} and
environmental cooperation, [global economic governance]{.underline},
overseas development assistance (ODA), [financial contributions to the
UN]{.underline} operating budget, [and other areas]{.underline}.192

In some of his recent writings, Minxin Pei seems to suggest that U.S.
policy should seek to exacerbate China's mostly self-inflicted pain.193
However, that does not seem particularly wise or necessary. As the
Brookings Institution's Strobe Talbott put it for the Soviet Union, the
system there went "into meltdown because of inadequacies and defects at
its core, not because of anything the outside world had done or
threatened to do." Cold War historian Westad agrees: it came about
primarily "because of weaknesses and contradictions in the Soviet system
itself."194 One maxim often attributed to Napoleon was "never interrupt
your enemy when he's making a mistake." It is not at all clear that it
is sensible to think of China as an "enemy."195 However, the arresting
dictum does seem to have some bearing on the case.

At the same time, fulminations that seem to suggest a desire for "regime
change" in China are unlikely to be either wise or effective, not the
least because, as Lyle Goldstein points out, they can be used against
genuine indigenous efforts to promote human rights, and they founder on
the fact that "the United States manages to quietly and yet very
actively cooperate with states that have even worse human rights
records, such as Saudi Arabia."196

Overall, in fact, [the [record suggests]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, in part because it [has [often
supported]{.mark} countries with [appalling human rights]{.mark}
records]{.underline}, has not been very successful at influencing
foreign regimes on the treatment of their own citizens. After 1975,
democracy did grow remarkably [[in Latin America]{.underline}]{.mark},
but [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} mostly stood back,
watching and encouraging, and perhaps leading by example. It [did [use
force]{.mark}]{.underline} successfully [[to reimpose
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} when it lapsed in Grenada and Panama. But
it seems more reasonable to suggest that the efforts struck a responsive
chord rather than that the United States created one. Thus,
American-armed efforts to install, or re-install, democracy in those two
countries lasted, while similar ventures earlier had failed to do so
after the American troops left. The impressive advance in democracy (and
capitalism) in countries in East Central Europe that escaped the Soviet
embrace after 1989 did not require much participation by the United
States. The chief role model, as had been the case for Spain and
Portugal in the mid-1970s, was that supplied by the open, productive,
and prosperous countries in Western Europe, not by the United States.
The newly liberated countries were attracted to the European Union and
NATO---two clubs they could join if they came up to standards. For the
most part, they were quite willing to try.197

Nor is a policy of "containment" likely to be successful. It is commonly
argued that containment worked against the Soviet Union. In the long
run, policymakers hoped that the Soviets, frustrated in their
expansionist drive, would become less hostile and more accommodating. In
the end, however, the problem that containment was designed to deal with
went away only when the policy itself lapsed---a development that helped
Communism to self-destruct and that led directly to the end of the Cold
War when an exhausted and much overextended Soviet Union abandoned its
expansionist ideology.198 In 1975, three countries---Cambodia, South
Vietnam, and Laos---abruptly toppled into the Communist camp. Then,
partly out of fear of repeating the Vietnam experience, the United
States went into a sort of containment funk: it simply watched from the
sidelines as the Soviet Union opportunistically gathered a set of Third
World countries into its imperial embrace: Angola in 1976, Mozambique
and Ethiopia in 1977, South Yemen and Afghanistan in 1978, and Grenada
and Nicaragua in 1979. The Soviets at first were quite gleeful about
these acquisitions---the "correlation of forces," as they called it, had
decisively and most agreeably shifted in their direction. However,
almost all the acquisitions soon became economic and political basket
cases, fraught with dissension, financial mismanagement, and civil
warfare, and turned expectantly to the Soviet Union for maternal warmth
and sustenance. Most disastrous for the Soviet Union was its experience
in Afghanistan, where it engaged in a long, enervating war. Meanwhile,
the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe had also became a severe economic
drain and a political liability for Moscow. In the end, the economic
bill to the Soviet Union for maintaining its growing collection of
dependencies around the world rose dramatically.199 It soon came to
realize that it would have been better off contained.

Thus, [it is far from clear what the United States]{.underline} and the
rest of the world [can do about China's economically foolish
authoritarian drive]{.underline} except to issue declarations of
disapproval and to deal more warily. That's pretty much what it did
under the regime of Mao Zedong during China's massively self-destructive
periods of the Great Leap Forward of 1958--62 and of the Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1965--75.200 Both of these were
eventually altered by policy change within the Communist Party rather
than by internal rebellion or by outside pressure. As Bandow points out,
"[[No]{.mark} combination of]{.underline} lectures, sanctions, and
[[threat]{.mark}s [is likely to force a nationalistic regime to abandon
policies]{.mark} that [it views]{.mark} as [essential for its]{.mark}
political [control]{.mark}]{.underline}."201

2\. We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential
national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere; [[nor
is China a monolith]{.mark}, or [the views of]{.mark} its [leaders set
in stone]{.mark}. Although its]{.underline} rapid economic and military
[growth has led Beijing toward a more assertive international
role]{.underline}, many [[Chinese officials and]{.mark} other [elites
know]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} moderate, [pragmatic]{.mark} and genuinely
cooperative [approach with]{.mark} the [West serves China's
interests]{.mark}. Washington's [adversarial stance]{.mark}]{.underline}
toward Beijing [[weakens]{.mark} the influence of [those voices in favor

balance of competition and cooperation, U.S. actions can strengthen
those Chinese leaders who want China to play a constructive role in
world affairs.

3\. U.S. efforts to treat China as an enemy and decouple it from the
global economy will damage the United States' international role and
reputation and undermine the economic interests of all nations. U.S.
opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese
economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an
increase in China's role in world affairs. Moreover, the United States
cannot significantly slow China's rise without damaging itself. If the
United States presses its allies to treat China as an economic and
political enemy, it will weaken its relations with those allies and
could end up isolating itself rather than Beijing.

4\. The [[fear]{.mark} that [Beijing will replace]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as the global leader [is exaggerated.
Most]{.mark} other [countries have no interest in such]{.mark} an
[outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it is not clear that Beijing itself
sees this goal as necessary or feasible. Moreover, a government intent
on limiting the information and opportunities available to its own
citizens and harshly repressing its ethnic minorities will not garner
meaningful international support nor succeed in attracting global
talent. The best American response to these practices is to work with
our allies and partners to create a more open and prosperous world in
which China is offered the opportunity to participate. Efforts to
isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a
more humane and tolerant society.

5\. Although China has set a goal of becoming a world-class military by
midcentury, it faces immense hurdles to operating as a globally dominant
military power. However, Beijing's growing military capabilities have
already eroded the United States' long-standing military preeminence in
the Western Pacific. The best way to respond to this is not to engage in
an open-ended arms race centered on offensive, deep-strike weapons and
the virtually impossible goal of reasserting full-spectrum U.S.
dominance up to China's borders. A wiser policy is to work with allies
to maintain deterrence, emphasizing defensive-oriented, area denial
capabilities, resiliency and the ability to frustrate attacks on U.S. or
allied territory, while strengthening crisis-management efforts with
Beijing.

6\. [Beijing]{.underline} is seeking to weaken the role of Western
democratic norms within the global order. But it [is not seeking to
overturn vital]{.underline} economic and other [components of that
[order]{.mark} from which [China]{.mark} itself [has benefited]{.mark}
for decades]{.underline}. Indeed, China's engagement in the
international system is essential to the system's survival and to
effective action on common problems such as climate change. The United
States should encourage Chinese participation in new or modified global
regimes in which rising powers have a greater voice. [A
[zero-sum]{.mark} approach]{.underline} to China's role [would [only
encourage Beijing to]{.mark} either disengage from the system or
[sponsor a divided]{.mark} global [order]{.mark} that would be damaging
to Western interests.]{.underline}

In some places, [the [Chinese "model"]{.mark} proved [more destructive
than instructive]{.mark}. Beijing's [bullying]{.mark} of [Sri
Lanka]{.mark}]{.underline} into handing over the Hambantota port that it
built with borrowed Chinese money [[has not]{.mark} exactly [burnished
Beijing's reputation]{.mark} as a guardian of a new world
order]{.underline}. In fact, according to [Pew
Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/09/28/how-global-public-opinion-of-china-has-shifted-in-the-xi-era/),
[[favorable views of China]{.mark} have [dropped]{.mark} sharply around
the world]{.underline}---a fall [[reinforced by]{.mark} China's "digital
[authoritarianism]{.mark}" during [coronavirus]{.mark}, its
draconian]{.underline} and unsuccessful [[lockdown]{.mark} policy,
[and]{.mark} its [support for]{.mark} Russia's invasion
of [[Ukraine]{.mark}](https://sc.mp/ijro?utm_source=copy_link&utm_medium=share_widget&utm_campaign=3210691)]{.underline}.

In Europe, which is generally less strident than the United States,
China is on the verge of trading its once flourishing ties with the
world's most advanced economies for the cheap oil and the desperate
embrace of what [Alexander Gabuev
calls](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-new-vassal) its "new
vassal," Russia. At the EU-China summit in April 2022, the president of
the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, was blunt: "China, as a
permanent member of the UN Security Council, has a special
responsibility. No European citizen would understand any support to
Russia\'s ability to wage war." She is right. In February 2023,
a [report](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ASG-MERICS-MSC-Report-2023-Bridging-the-Gap-final.pdf) by
the Munich Security Conference showed that across the globe---including
in India and Brazil---two-thirds of those surveyed felt that China's
support for Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine made them wary of Chinese
ambitions.

Among the EU's new East European members, Beijing's much-touted "CEE+"
framework has foundered on China's willingness to see Ukraine's
sovereignty ravished and its bullying of states that veer even a little
on Taiwan,
like [Lithuania](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/86208). China
has also forfeited one of its more important European [trade and
investment
partners](https://www.eurozine.com/no-limits-china-russia-and-ukraine/) in
Ukraine itself. At one point. Volodymyr Zelensky offered Ukraine as
"China's bridge to Europe," and Chinese companies began the construction
of the largest wind farm in Europe near Donetsk and the refitting of the
port of Mariupol, now in ruins.

[If weakening the Western alliance]{.underline} structure [is one of
Beijing's aims, it is now more distant than ever. Ukraine and Moldova
have been advanced to candidate status for [the EU]{.mark}]{.underline},
and NATO, the very embodiment of Western global domination in Beijing's
view, has been given new life, strength, and members by the actions of
Xi's "best friend" in Moscow. Worse than that from China's point of
view, [the alliance has now [incorporated China's]{.mark} own
[neighborhood into its security]{.mark} stance]{.underline}. In 2022,
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} formally [[declared]{.mark} the
Indo-[Pacific]{.mark} to be [part of its]{.mark} "shared security
[interests]{.mark}."]{.underline} Under President Joe Biden, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has significantly [increased]{.mark} the
[prominence]{.mark}]{.underline} of policy initiatives [[in this region,
such as the]{.underline}]{.mark} Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or
[[Quad]{.underline}]{.mark} (composed of India, Australia, Japan, and
the United States), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} taken actions---like
[[selling nuclear]{.mark}-powered [sub]{.mark}marine[s to
Australia]{.mark} and]{.underline} adding U.S. [[bases in]{.mark} the
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline}---that [[support]{.mark} a more
[muscular U.S. presence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region.

#### China can't become a military hegemon AND it's structurally constrained. 

**Latham 23**, Professor of International Relations, Macalester College,

superpower," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3936751-china-a-great-power-but-not-a-superpower/)

But [[China]{.mark} today [falls far short of superpower]{.mark}
standing]{.underline}. To be sure, China dominates its home region
economically and exercises considerable influence farther afield. But
[[it lacks]{.mark} the [ability to project military]{.mark} power
[beyond its]{.mark} immediate [hinterland, is facing]{.mark} a
[concerted effort to balance it]{.mark}]{.underline} diplomatically and
[[militarily across]{.mark} the Indo-[Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}
region, [[has]{.mark} almost [no soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}
resources to exploit, [[is not]{.mark} the [hub of a]{.mark}
globe-spanning [alliance system and remains]{.mark} more [a
rule-taker]{.mark} than rule-maker in the global institutional
space]{.underline}.

All this being the case, [the conclusion is undeniable: While China
is]{.underline} unquestionably both [a regional power]{.underline} and a
great power, when it comes to [superpower status, it]{.underline} simply
[doesn't make the cut]{.underline}.

[[Nor]{.underline}]{.mark}, it must be said, [[is it likely to
ascend]{.mark} to the status of superpower any time soon. [China's
population is]{.mark} both getting [old and shrinking]{.mark}; its
[economy looks]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly like those of other
countries that have come [to be [mired]{.mark} in the]{.underline}
so-called ["middle income trap"; [and]{.mark} its]{.underline} once
bright [geopolitical star has begun to fade as
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world begin to [[take steps
to balance against]{.underline}]{.mark} what they see [as [a]{.mark}n
increasingly [belligerent]{.mark} great [power]{.mark}.]{.underline}

To be sure, there are those who look at the evidence and come to
different conclusions. But to most serious China watchers, the trend
lines have become obvious. [[China
is [peaking](https://theconversation.com/rethinking-the-us-china-fight-does-china-really-threaten-american-power-abroad-148672)]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
and is doing so long before assuming the mantle of superpower.

And if this is the case -- [if China is something less than a full-blown
superpower -- then the whole edifice of]{.underline} Cold War II and its
derivative [[Containment]{.mark} 2.0 [is]{.mark}]{.underline} revealed
for what it is: [[a]{.mark} nostalgia-inflected [delusion fraught
with]{.mark} the danger of [overreaction]{.mark}]{.underline}, needless
geopolitical friction and possibly even tragically unnecessary war.

#### China can't become a military power.

First, although in recent years China has become more motivated to build
up its military capacities, [[there is no]{.underline}]{.mark} clear
[[evidence]{.mark} that [China is]{.mark}]{.underline} currently
[[determined to supplant]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[as]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} military [power
globally]{.mark}]{.underline}. This might emerge in the future as a
deliberate Chinese policy, but it has not yet. 

In this context, it's critical to understand
that [[China does not possess]{.mark} and is not currently investing to
create a [worldwide]{.mark} network of [military
bases]{.mark}]{.underline} like the United States. [China now [spends
far less than]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates does
[on]{.mark} its [military]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a little over
one-third of the amount in absolute terms, and less than half as much as
a share of its economy.  [China also [does not have extensive]{.mark}
military [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} across the globe, as the United
States does.

Second, [China is [still focused]{.mark} mainly [on its]{.mark}
immediate [neighborhood, where it seeks to]{.mark}]{.underline} end
America's past military predominance in order to [[reduce its]{.mark}
own [vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this effort, China has met
with real success. U.S. maritime and air superiority in the Western
Pacific is largely gone and is almost certainly not coming back in any
foreseeable time frame, absent the unlikely collapse of China's
economy. There is no "silver bullet" technology or level of resources
that can easily alter this picture.   

Pentagon reports have highlighted significant near-peer level PLA
advances in five specific realms: shipbuilding, electronic warfare,
ballistic and cruise missiles, cyber capabilities, and integrated air
defense systems. As noted, these efforts are primarily directed toward
negating U.S. military superiority along China's coasts and nearby
maritime areas, especially around Taiwan.  

Chinese strategy has also shifted beyond immediate offshore defense to
protection of the "open seas," in order, [it
says](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/download/whitepaperonnationaldefenseinnewera.doc),
to "safeguard national sovereignty, protect strategic sea lines of
communication, and participate in international maritime cooperation."
Nowhere has it said or even implied that China's ultimate and necessary
goal is to become the dominant global military power. It wants to create
a "world-class military" that has the capabilities of other advanced
militaries. 

Any effort to spend our way back to total dominance in the Western
Pacific near China's shores is likely doomed to failure. China spends
less than 2 percent of its total economic product, or GDP, on defense,
as opposed to the almost 4 percent (and rising) that the United States
spends. That means the Chinese have room to ramp up military spending,
possibly to match our own. China also does not have to spread its
defense spending around the entire world as the United States does, but
instead focuses mainly on the Western Pacific.

Not only will an arms race with China for dominance in Asia fail because
it can very likely keep up with us financially, but an open-ended arms
race will be extremely expensive and risky. A race for superiority
off China's shores would increase regional instability and
increase the risk of disastrous miscalculation, possibly leading to
direct military conflict between the U.S. and China.   

But crucially, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can achieve]{.mark}
its [defensive goals in]{.mark} the Western
[Pacific, including]{.mark} the defense of [Taiwan, without]{.mark}
trying to spend our way to total military [dominance]{.mark}
of the Western Pacific]{.underline}. Maintaining a defensive presence
adequate to deter Chinese aggression is far less expensive than seeking
dominance, and can be achieved well within our current budget
trajectory. 

Although [the [Chinese]{.mark} military]{.underline} has largely
closed the gap with the United States in the Western Pacific, it [[still
faces]{.mark} many strategic, [structural, tech]{.mark}nological, [and
manpower constraints in developing]{.mark} into a [superior]{.mark}
military [force]{.mark}]{.underline} (or even a full-fledged peer
competitor) to the United States. In some cases, [[it is decades
behind]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### They can't project power globally.

Studies, former Norwegian Diplomat (Jo Inge Bekkevold, March 2, 2023,

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is only a regional
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. It wields global economic power and
influence, but [[the]{.mark} geographic [reach of its military
is]{.mark} largely [limited to]{.mark} the Asian and Indo-[Pacific
theaters]{.mark}]{.underline}. From its position in the East Asian
rimland, [China [has]{.mark} more [limited]{.mark} geographic
[reach]{.mark}]{.underline} into the Eurasian continent than the Cold
War-era Soviet Union did---and less access to the high seas than either
the United States or the Soviet Union. [The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates']{.underline} blessed geographic [[position gives
it]{.mark} direct and [unhindered access to the]{.mark} Atlantic,
[Pacific]{.mark}, and Arctic oceans]{.underline}. Although the Soviet
Union's access to the high seas was more restricted than that of the
United States, it still had direct access from its homeland to the
Pacific and Arctic oceans, as well as almost-but-not-quite direct access
to the Atlantic Ocean. [[China]{.mark} only borders the Pacific
Ocean---and [is]{.mark} largely [hemmed]{.mark} in [by]{.mark} major
[island chains it does not control]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If China is not satisfied being a regional power and aims to become a
true superpower, it will need to leapfrog the geopolitical constraints
of its home region.

Naturally, China's nuclear, space, and cyber capabilities all have
worldwide reach. China is modernizing and expanding its nuclear force as
well as its nuclear delivery platforms. Moreover, with nearly 600
satellites in orbit---of which 229 are intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance satellites---China has the world's second largest fleet
of satellites after the United States. Chinese cyber capabilities can
wreak havoc in every corner of the world. And these days, balloons
should perhaps also be added to the picture as a potent capability with
global reach.

Nevertheless, [[the]{.mark} geographic [reach]{.mark} of]{.underline}
these [technologies [is insufficient to]{.mark} strongly
[influence]{.mark} strategic [theaters beyond Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Even in an age of space and cyber warfare, coercive diplomacy is more
effective when troops can be physically deployed to a border or shore.
Gunboat diplomacy still requires boats, and airplanes still need
airfields to operate in far-flung regions. In other words, [[geography
makes China]{.mark} even more [dependent]{.mark} than the United
States]{.underline} and former Soviet Union [[on]{.mark} overseas [bases
and]{.mark} willing [allies]{.mark} to move its armed
forces]{.underline} beyond its home region. [[China has]{.mark} almost
[none of either]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} currently [has only one overseas
base]{.underline}---its naval facility [in Djibouti]{.underline} staffed
with 400 Chinese marines. While the U.S. Navy sails the world's oceans
on a daily basis, [the Chinese navy only occasionally conducts naval
diplomacy missions beyond the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. This may
change, of course, with the Chinese navy now adding aircraft carriers
and other blue-water vessels to its fast-growing fleet. China is
reportedly looking to add more overseas bases in the Pacific Ocean and
Africa. However, [[it is]{.mark} still [a long-term project for China to
turn]{.mark} itself [into a]{.mark} true
[superpower]{.mark}]{.underline} with world-wide military reach.
Moreover, the [[U.S.]{.mark} forward [posture in]{.mark} China's
[neighborhood complicates such]{.mark} a scenario]{.underline}---which
is where the third concept, regional hegemony, comes in.

#### China [won't]{.underline} and [can't]{.underline} establish a sphere of influence and it's [circumventable]{.underline} even if they did. 

**Mueller 21**, Political Scientist, Ohio State University, Senior
Fellow, CATO Institute, quoting Yun Jiang, Researcher, Australian
National University (John Mueller, May 18, 2021, "China: Rise or
Demise?" CATO Policy Analysis, No. 917,
https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-05/policy-analysis-917.pdf)

A [Chinese Sphere of Influence?]{.underline}

Many commentators have raised concerns about China's often-expressed
desire to have more "influence" in the world. They point, in particular,
to an elaborate Chinese scheme---the Belt and Road Initiative---to
establish sea and land lanes to maintain and enhance China's ability to
trade with the rest of the world. Unsurprisingly, many in the United
States envision this as a key part of a diabolical plot by the Chinese
to "rule the world."46

However, it is absurd to obsess over something like the vacuous, if
venerable, sphere of influence concept. The notion that world affairs
are a process in which countries scamper around the world seeking to
establish spheres of influence is at best decidedly unhelpful and at
worst utterly misguided.47 But the concept continues to be embraced in
some quarters as if it had some palpable meaning. For example, in 2017,
the National Intelligence Council opined that "geopolitical competition
is on the rise as China and Russia seek to exert more sway over their
neighboring regions and promote an order in which U.S. influence does
not dominate."48

However, it is difficult to see whether American "influence" could be
said to "dominate" anywhere. For example, on December 21, 2017, when the
United States sought to alter the status of Jerusalem, the United
Nations General Assembly repudiated the U.S. stand in a nearly unanimous
vote that included many U.S. allies. That's influence?49 Indeed, it is
impressive that the hegemon, endowed with what Reich and Lebow aptly
call a grossly disproportionate military capacity, has had such a
miserable record of military achievement since 1945.50 The militarized
application of American primacy and hegemony to order the world has
often been a fiasco.51

The same holds for China's efforts. As Fingar notes, "muscular [displays
of [Chinese]{.mark} military [power]{.mark} may have been [intended to
dissuade]{.mark} neighboring [countries from lending support to]{.mark}
imputed [U.S.]{.mark} military planning]{.underline}, but they seriously
undercut efforts to reassure other countries that they had no reason to
fear China's 'peaceful rise.'"52 Westad points out that the efforts
"have all backfired: East Asia is much warier of Chinese aims today than
it was a decade ago," and he cites a Pew Research Center poll that shows
the percentage of South Koreans who viewed China's rise favorably fell
from 66 percent in 2002 to 34 percent in 2017.53

The Spread of Chinese Ideology

H. R. McMaster, a national security adviser in the Trump administration,
warned in 2020 that "China has become a threat because its leaders are
promoting a closed, authoritarian model as an alternative to democratic
governance and free-market economics."54 However, concerns that China is
bent on spreading some sort of dangerous alternative ideology seem to be
singularly misplaced. Not only are authoritarianism, dictatorships, and
kleptocracy far from new, but they can scarcely be said to constitute an
ideology.55 And insofar as they can, most of the countries so
"influenced" are unlikely to need much guidance: they are already
masters of the form.56 Moreover, as Harvard's Alistair Ian Johnston
notes, it is not all that clear that China is even trying to export or
promote its system: in Latin America, for instance, it has closer
economic and institutional ties with democratic Costa Rica and Chile
than with authoritarian Venezuela and Cuba.57

Actually, any comparative advantage the Chinese derive may stem less
from their own efforts at image projection than from the destructive and
appalling failures of American foreign and particularly military policy
over the past few decades, most notably in the Middle East.58 China may
also derive some reputational benefit from its comparatively successful
handling of the COVID-19 pandemic---although mainly from those who
ignore the successes of far less authoritarian regimes in the area, such
as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The Contest to Police the Global Commons

[[China does seem]{.mark} to be more [assertive about]{.mark}
controlling piles of rocks]{.underline}, sometimes known as [[islands,
in]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}
and establishing a greater presence in that area. As Ambassador Chas
Freeman points out, "[[China has not expanded its]{.mark} maritime
territorial [claims]{.mark}, which [date back to]{.mark} at least
[the]{.mark} early [20th century]{.mark}]{.underline}," but [[it
disputes]{.mark} the [occupation of]{.mark} some of [those]{.mark}
claims by Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam]{.underline} that
started in the 1970s. In the meantime, it has "transformed its tenuous
holdings in the South China Sea into an impressive array of artificial
islands and installations from which no other claimants can hope to
dislodge it."59

China's concerns seem to be two-fold. First, [the [sea lanes are crucial
to]{.mark} the country]{.underline}---fully [two-thirds of the
[commerce]{.mark}]{.underline} that flows through that waterway
originates in or [is destined for China. [Thus, China is likely]{.mark}
to be [worried occasionally]{.mark}]{.underline} about whether it can
count on the continuous benevolence of the U.S. Navy, which has
unilaterally presented itself to be the policing agency for what it
likes to call "the global commons"---a fancy term for oceans.60 After
all, policing agencies in cities not only keep the streets open and the
traffic flowing but also deem it necessary to close off some avenues
from time to time. [Second, [as China has become]{.mark} more
[prosperous]{.mark}, the [demand]{.mark} at home [for fish]{.mark} has
dramatically [increased]{.mark}]{.underline}, a phenomenon unlikely to
taper off as the country continues to develop. Consequently,
[[disputes]{.mark} with its neighbors [over fishing]{.mark} areas have
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline}.61

[[To deem these]{.mark} developments to constitute [some]{.mark} sort of
[global threat is excessive. Should China]{.mark} come to]{.underline}
imagine that it [[control]{.mark}s [that]{.mark} body of [water]{.mark},
it [will still have]{.mark} an [intense interest in]{.mark} the [free
flow of ships]{.mark} through it. [Even if China blocked]{.mark}
passage, [ships could take other routes]{.mark}]{.underline} with only
fairly minor inconvenience and expense.62 Zakaria notes a similarity
with the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 when the United States, then a rising
country, "declared the entire Western Hemisphere off-limits to the great
powers of Europe."63 Moreover, fishing disputes have been around forever
and are more nearly the inspiration for farce than for cosmic sturm und
drang.

#### China wouldn't establish one and US allies prevent total influence.

**Bo 20**, Opinion Columnist, SCMP, Retired CISS Senior Fellow, Tsinghua
University, former Senior Colonel, People's Liberation Army (Zhou Bo,

influence even as US power wanes," South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3108284/stronger-china-has-no-reason-seek-sphere-influence-even-us-power)

But no international laws prohibit land reclamation, and some other
claimants have done the same. [[China maintains]{.underline}]{.mark}
that around [[100,000 ships transit]{.mark} through [the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea every year [without f]{.mark}reedom
[o]{.mark}f [n]{.mark}avigation [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. What
China opposes are military activities against the interests of the
littoral states in the name of freedom of navigation.

[The [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} government has [[repeatedly
stressed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China]{.mark} would [not seek to
be]{.mark} a [hegemon even if it]{.mark} became [developed]{.mark}.
Although [this might sound like lip service]{.mark}]{.underline} to
some, [[its assertion is backed by]{.underline}]{.mark} history. For
[[2,000 years]{.underline}]{.mark}, much of [East [Asia was part
of]{.mark} the [Chinese sphere]{.mark} of influence, [but
that]{.mark}]{.underline} influence [[was primarily
cultural]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Admiral Zheng He's seven voyages in the Indian Ocean showed the sweeping
power of the "Celestial Empire" in the Ming dynasty, but the Chinese
didn't bother establishing a single military base in any of these
places. It was only 600 years later that the People's Liberation Army
established a [logistics
base](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2113300/chinas-djibouti-military-base-logistics-facility-or?module=inline&pgtype=article) there
in support of counter-piracy efforts in the Indian Ocean.

Influence and a sphere of influence are two different things. Today,
China's influence almost overlaps with that of the United States. Such
influence will grow further since China is widely expected to surpass
the US to become the world's largest economy in terms of gross domestic
product in 10 to 15 years. In other words, a global China is already
influential enough to demand any spheres of influence.

This then invites two most important questions for the 21st century: how
will the world accommodate China's rise? And, what can China bring to
the world?

China's [Belt and Road
Initiative](https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/china/article/3007692/belt-and-road/index.html) might
provide an answer to the second question. The initiative is ambitious,
but it is not a gilded instrument of a new Chinese order, as The
Economist asserted. It is not charity -- China invests for mutual
benefit. Neither is it a "debt trap" -- who would spend [trillions of

lay such a mega trap? Any such grand scheme might take generations to
finish. But the projects are, day by day, changing the economic
landscape of the developing countries along the belt and road for the
better.

Contrary to Allison's suggestions, the last thing the US wants is to
cede any sphere of influence to China, its primary competitor in what it
sees as a [new era of great-power
competition](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf).
In East Asia, the challenge is how Beijing and Washington, with their
overlapping influence, could coexist.

The [[US suspects China]{.mark} is [trying to drive it
out]{.mark}]{.underline} of the region. [It has [stepped up]{.mark} its
provocations [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Taiwan]{.mark}
Strait [and]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}, which risk testing the patience of a
PLA [growing ever
stronger](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3107686/policy-meeting-ends-defiant-note-chinese-leadership-insists?module=inline&pgtype=article).

Winston Churchill once famously quipped: "There is only one thing worse
than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them." In East
Asia, [[America's allies are]{.mark} steeling themselves and [tiptoeing
between]{.mark} their [ally and]{.mark} their [top trading
partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. So far, none has joined the US Navy on
its freedom of navigation operations in the 12-nautical-mile waters off
Chinese rocks and islands in the South China Sea.

There is no guarantee the US could win in a military conflict with China
in the first chain of islands stretching from Japan to the Philippines
and the South China Sea. But should it lose, the consequence is not
moot: it would lose prestige and credibility among its allies and
partners in the region. The alliance would fall apart and it may have to
go home. In that sense, only the United States can displace the United
States in the Western Pacific.

Allison is right to conclude the illusion that other nations will simply
take their assigned place in a US-led international order is over. But
even if that means there are indeed [[spheres]{.mark} of
influence]{.underline} in the world today, China should beware and stay
away from them. They [[look more like]{.mark} perilous [traps
than]{.mark} power [vacuums awaiting China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### An equal and opposite explanation exists for every instance of aggression\-\--it's impossible to give monocausal explanation of them as crazy Chinese warmongering. 

**Heer 22**, Distinguished Fellow at the Center for the National
Interest and a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs (Paul Heer, February 11, 2022, "What Is Really Driving
Chinese Aggression?" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-really-driving-chinese-aggression-200516?page=0%2C1)

Foreign [[commentary on China]{.mark}'s]{.underline} international
[behavior]{.underline} routinely [[characterizes it]{.underline}]{.mark}
(in varying measures) [[as aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark}, coercive,
[expansionist]{.underline}, and nationalistic---especially [under
Chinese Communist Party]{.underline} (CCP) leader Xi Jinping. This is
usually attributed to the inherent nature of the CCP and/or of Xi
personally. Although the adjectives are often appropriate, [[what
is]{.mark} frequently [overlooked]{.mark}]{.underline} or dismissed
[[is]{.mark} the extent to which [Beijing is responding
to]{.mark}]{.underline} external stimuli or [[other players'
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, [[in virtually every case]{.mark}
of Chinese assertiveness or belligerence]{.underline}, it is not hard to
identify what Beijing felt the need to react to.

For example, [Chinese saber-rattling]{.underline} and ultimatums
[regarding [Taiwan]{.mark} are]{.underline} in part [[a]{.mark}
predictable [response to]{.mark}]{.underline} cumulative [actions by
both [Taipei]{.mark} and Washington that have [retreated
from]{.mark}]{.underline} or eroded [[prior]{.mark} historical
[understandings]{.mark}]{.underline} with Beijing [[about]{.mark} what
["one China"]{.mark} means]{.underline} and doesn't mean. CCP leaders
have long been prepared to postpone their pursuit of unification as long
as those understandings were operative.

Beijing's ongoing [crackdown in [Hong Kong was]{.mark}]{.underline}
prompted in part [by the [local authorities'
failure]{.mark}]{.underline}---after more than twenty years---[[to
enact]{.mark} national [security legislation]{.mark} (as required by
Hong Kong's Basic Law)]{.underline} and to maintain public order in the
wake of protests against such legislation and in favor of democratic
electoral reforms. Some protesters had become violent, demanded faster
political reform than Beijing had promised, rejected potential paths to
compromise, or openly advocated Hong Kong's independence. [[CCP]{.mark}
leaders]{.underline}, who had earlier been relatively patient, brought
the hammer down when they [[saw]{.mark} their control and Chinese
[sovereignty at risk]{.mark}. Similarly]{.underline}, Beijing's ruthless
crackdown and tactics [in [Xinjiang]{.mark}]{.underline}, although an
extreme overreaction, [were [triggered]{.mark}]{.underline} in part
[[by]{.mark} a series of [terror]{.mark}ist [attacks]{.mark} by Islamic
extremists]{.underline}.

There is also a reactive and defensive element to Beijing's aggressive
behavior in all of its territorial disputes---in which China has not
been the only assertive and nationalistic player. [In the [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, the [action-reaction]{.mark} cycle that
[led]{.mark} over time [to Beijing's]{.mark} massive]{.underline}
reinforcement of its infrastructure and [military [presence]{.mark} has
[also featured]{.mark} efforts by [rival claimants]{.mark}]{.underline}
to bolster their own positions while similarly resisting any constraints
on their freedom of action. In the East China Sea, [Beijing's
increased]{.underline} operational [[presence]{.mark} over
the]{.underline} past decade [[was driven]{.underline}]{.mark} in part
[[by Tokyo's "nationalization" of]{.mark} the disputed [Senkaku]{.mark}
Islands]{.underline} in conjunction with an apparent retreat from what
some scholars assert was prior Japanese acknowledgment of the existence
of a territorial dispute and willingness to shelve it. Finally, [the
[U.S. view]{.mark} of aggressive Chinese behavior [on]{.mark} the
[Sino-Indian border is]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[driven by
Indian]{.mark} tactical [reports]{.mark}, whereas Chinese accounts of
"who started it" might be no less credible]{.underline}.

In each of these territorial disputes, it is worth noting that it
probably was not in China's best interests to unilaterally provoke
tensions---unless Beijing in each case was intentionally looking for an
excuse to reinforce its military position at the expense of its
diplomatic reputation. It is more likely that CCP leaders, preoccupied
with myriad domestic challenges---including perennial fears of internal
unrest---preferred (as they frequently assert both publicly and
privately) to maintain a peaceful external environment that allows them
to focus on their domestic priorities. Precisely for that reason,
Beijing has long prepared to keep its territorial disputes and
aspirations on the back burner. But when other disputants take steps
that alter the equation in ways that challenge or erode China's
position, the Chinese feel compelled to react, and often do so
disproportionately.

Of course, in all of these cases---including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
Xinjiang---there have been good reasons for the United States to be
sympathetic to parties on the receiving end of China's coercive
behavior. When Beijing assaults human rights or acts aggressively
toward---or scores points against---U.S. allies and partners, Washington
will appropriately take its stand. At the same time, an accurate and
objective assessment of such situations and formulation of the most
effective U.S. response would consider the underlying interactive
dynamics. It is not unreasonable for Beijing to expect or at least to
seek that other countries have some understanding of its perspective and
the circumstances under which it is acting. U.S. moral or material
support for the targets of Chinese assertiveness should not come at the
expense of recognizing what and how actions by those other players---and
Washington itself---contributed to Beijing's behavior. At the very
least, disregarding the Chinese point of view will hinder mutual
understanding and a constructive response to disputes and crises. On the
contrary, it usually reinforces Beijing's belligerent tendencies (as we
are now seeing with Moscow on the Ukraine issue).

China's "wolf warrior diplomacy" amply reflects this reactivity. It is
true, as has been widely noted over the past few years, that many
Chinese diplomats have grown increasingly vituperative in their
rhetoric, especially but not exclusively toward the United States. But
this has been reactive in two respects. First, it has partly been a
response to an increase in vitriolic comments about China by foreign
diplomats, most notably former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who also
mirrored (if not prompted) Beijing's resort to misinformation when
Washington and Beijing were trading blame for the spread of Covid-19.
Some Chinese diplomats apparently thought they should give as much as
they got in terms of polemics.

More importantly, "wolf warrior diplomacy" almost certainly has
reflected Beijing's view that its perspective on international issues
has been disregarded, particularly by Washington. Chinese diplomats
routinely protest what Beijing sees as challenges to China's
sovereignty, security, and stability and the lack of reciprocity and
accommodation in U.S.-China relations. But under the Trump
administration, and so far under the Biden administration, they have
frequently seen their complaints dismissed as invalid, self-serving,
exaggerated, or aimed at blaming Washington for bilateral tensions.
Those U.S. criticisms are often well-grounded, and Beijing has often
been similarly dismissive of American talking points. But clearly, both
sides have some valid concerns about each other, and both sides escalate
the rhetoric when they perceive that the other is rebuffing their
concerns.

This aspect of Beijing's "wolf warrior diplomacy" was recently explained
by scholars who examined the transcripts of Chinese Foreign Ministry
speeches over the past two decades.
They [found](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/12/chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-like-talk-tough/) that
rhetorical hostility increased along with---and usually in response
to---growing external criticism of China, which eventually prompted
calls by Xi to enhance China's defensive "fighting spirit" in answer to
foreign "scolding." Beijing has thus been reacting to what it sees as
international disdain of its point of view and its expression of Chinese
interests and concerns. To whatever extent those interests and concerns
are legitimate, Beijing's frustration is predictable---even when its
response is arrogant and obnoxious.

Researchers at the International Crisis Group (ICG) highlighted the
reactive component of Chinese international behavior nearly a decade ago
when
its [analysis](https://www.crisisgroup.org/index.php?q=asia/north-east-asia/china/china-takes-gloves) coined
the term "reactive assertiveness" to characterize China's actions in the
South and East China Seas. ICG defined this as "responding forcefully to
perceived provocations," or when "Beijing uses an action by another
party as justification to push back hard and change the facts on the
ground in its favor." Although this was an accurate description, over
time, the narrative of Chinese "assertiveness" eclipsed the "reactive"
part of the equation in most foreign commentary, perhaps because Beijing
was deemed to have only "perceived" provocations and was so blatant in
"pushing back hard." There has also been little inclination in
Washington to assign any blame to smaller parties when China's behavior
and relative weight usually make it easy to portray Beijing as the bad
guy. Consequently, despite scholars' efforts
to [refute](https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/7/1/47/574393) its
historical validity, China's "new assertiveness" became the prevailing
meme.

But the reactive element of Chinese behavior has always been
instrumental, and acknowledging it is crucially important. Beijing goes
on the offensive not just when it feels the urge or sees the opportunity
but when it perceives the need. Even the CCP's recent abandonment of
Deng Xiaoping's longstanding guidance for China to "hide its
capabilities and bide its time" was as much a response to Beijing's
assessment of an increasingly problematic and even hostile external
environment, as it was the result of a calculation that China had
greater capabilities with which to pursue its interests and security.
That combination has set the stage for the CCP's increasingly forceful
reactions to what it genuinely views as challenges by other players to
China's security and sovereignty and disregard for its strategic
perspective.

Again, none of this is meant to excuse Beijing's aggressive and coercive
behavior, or to absolve it of China's ample share of the blame for
tensions along its periphery. The CCP leads a nasty authoritarian regime
and is ruthless in its exercise of power both domestically and abroad.
And even when Beijing has valid international concerns, it routinely
overplays its hand or resorts to the bluntest policy instruments and the
least subtle forms of diplomacy. Nonetheless, strategic empathy---which
is wholly distinct from sympathy---remains crucial to understanding
Chinese behavior and to de-escalating crises, and averting conflict.
Within that framework, actions by other players---including China's
neighbors and the United States---are key drivers of Beijing's
perception of the international environment and responses to it. Failure
or refusal to recognize this can only lead to flawed diagnoses of the
challenge China represents and flawed prescriptions for dealing with it.

Many ask [[why Beijing behaves]{.mark} so [badly]{.mark}
internationally]{.underline}, and in ways that have been
counterproductive to its interests and reputation by sparking backlash
from other countries. It [[is not]{.underline}]{.mark} just [[because it
is in the CCP's nature]{.mark} to do so]{.underline}. It is primarily
because [[Chinese leaders, like]{.mark} national [leaders elsewhere, see
challenges]{.mark} and]{.underline} even [threats [to their]{.mark}
country's [interests]{.mark}, security, or
sovereignty]{.underline}---beyond the risks that they perceive to the
CCP regime's control and tenure. [We [should not be surprised if Beijing
acts in defense]{.mark} and pursuit of China's national
interests]{.underline}, and sometimes attributes its need to do so to
the actions of other countries. Mutual understanding and constructive
relations between the United States and China will be very difficult to
achieve if Washington overlooks or denies the defensive and reactive
component of Beijing's strategic mindset.

### AT: Taiwan !\-\--Structurally Constrained\-\--2NC

#### Xi won't aggress because he believes China's problems can be overcome\-\--when power does peak, peaceful decline would result, especially because of conventional deterrence. 

**Roy 22**, Senior Fellow, East-West Center, Honolulu, Ph.D., Political
Science, University of Chicago (Denny Roy, April 1, 2022, "The
overstated danger of a peaking China," Asia Times,
https://asiatimes.com/2022/04/the-overstated-danger-of-a-peaking-china/)

[Rather than]{.underline} Zhongnanhai [secretly believing China has
peaked]{.underline}, a more convincing explanation is that, as Jude
Blanchette argues, [[Xi believes China can overcome]{.mark} the
[domestic]{.mark} economic, demographic and environmental [obstacles to
continued]{.mark} high rates of economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} by
quickly gaining global dominance in the high-value technologies of the
future (biotechnology, artificial intelligence, quantum computing,
robotics and so on) [while the United States is mired in political
dysfunction and social decay. [The notion]{.mark} that [China
would]{.mark} choose to [start a war]{.mark}]{.underline}, not because
present circumstances demand war but [out of belief in a closing
window]{.underline} of opportunity, [[assumes]{.mark} that [Beijing
is]{.mark} extraordinarily [aggressive. Beijing, however, is]{.mark}
relatively [cautious in]{.mark} its [use of force]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

[[Observers]{.mark} who have characterized]{.underline} several recent
[Chinese]{.underline} foreign policy [moves as "aggressive" [typically
mention]{.mark}]{.underline} increased PLA patrols and military
exercises near [[Taiwan]{.mark} and the disputed [Senkaku]{.mark}
Islands]{.underline}, the building of military [bases on artificial
islands in the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, the Galwan
Valley [skirmish with India]{.mark}, encroachment into]{.underline} the
territory of [Nepal]{.underline} and Bhutan, [[and disregard
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the Sino-British Joint Declaration on [[Hong
Kong. But]{.mark} most of [these PRC policies are]{.mark} at least
partly
Chinese [[reactions](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-really-driving-chinese-aggression-200516) to]{.mark}
moves by [other countries]{.mark}. More [importantly, all of
these]{.mark} policies [involve no]{.mark} or very low [risk of
significant]{.mark} military [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} with an
adversary. They are more opportunistic than aggressive.

[[If it anticipated]{.mark} an impending period of [waning]{.mark}
relative [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, demonstrably [[risk-averse Beijing
would]{.mark} be inclined to [avoid]{.mark} entering that
period]{.underline} under the disadvantage of having recently
antagonized strong regional states [through [aggressive]{.mark} military
[action]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

Throughout history, Chinese governments have presented themselves as
cooperative rather than confrontational when they assessed that the
configuration of international forces was not favorable to prevailing
through the use of force.

Most recently, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin suppressed their own
nationalist impulses because they believed a clash with the US was
counter-productive while China was in catch-up mode. [A return to a
[low]{.mark}er-[profile]{.mark}, non-threatening foreign [policy
is]{.mark} the [more likely]{.mark} Chinese [response to]{.mark}
perceived self-[decline]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While making their case that Beijing feels pressured to rush into war
this decade, Hal Brands and Michael Beckley observe that "[[other
countries]{.mark} are pushing back against Beijing's
assertiveness]{.underline}." As they note: "An array of actors is
gradually joining forces [to [check Beijing's power]{.mark} and put it
in a strategic box." This observation]{.underline} is correct, but it
actually [undermines their larger argument]{.underline}. The pushback,
which includes consolidation of the Quad joint security alliance
([[Australia]{.mark}, Japan, US and [India]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} the
increased likelihood that [Japan would]{.mark} help [defend Taiwan,
is]{.mark} already [so formidable]{.mark} as [to]{.mark} probably [deter
China from embarking on]{.mark} a campaign of military
[aggression]{.mark} even in the 2020s]{.underline}. 

#### China can't overtake the US. 

**Pei 21**, Professor of Government at Claremont McKenna College,
Bloomberg Opinion Columnist (Minxin Pei, May 27, 2021, "The China Threat
Is Being Overhyped," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-27/u-s-shouldn-t-treat-china-as-an-existential-threat)

The fact is, those throwing around the charge most liberally don't seem
to have thought through what it would really mean for China to threaten
the existence of the world's most powerful nation. In reality, [[China
has neither]{.mark} the destructive [capability nor]{.mark} the
geopolitical [motivation]{.mark} to destroy the U.S.]{.underline}

Most obviously, unlike the former Soviet Union, China does not possess a
nuclear arsenal large and powerful enough to obliterate the U.S. And,
[[while]{.mark} its [conventional power]{.mark} has
[grown]{.mark}]{.underline} to the point where it could inflict [serious
losses](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/were-going-to-lose-fast-us-air-force-held-a-war-game-that-started-with-a-chinese-biological-attack-170003936.html) on
U.S. forces [[in]{.mark} a [conflict over Taiwan, China]{.mark}'s
military significantly [lags the U.S. in tech]{.mark}nological
sophistication [and warfighting experience]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any
wider clash, [the [U.S. would]{.mark} also be able to [count on]{.mark}
the support of its [allies]{.mark} and China's regional rivals,
including [Japan and India]{.mark}]{.underline}, which themselves have
potent militaries. [[China]{.mark} will [be alone and face enemies on
many sides]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As for motivation, China is deeply resentful of the American security
presence in Asia. Its leaders see the U.S. as the principal obstacle to
their country's global ambitions. But there is no evidence that they are
bent on regime change in the U.S. or seek its physical destruction.

[[China has no]{.mark} real ideological [appeal]{.mark} outside its
borders]{.underline}, despite assiduously promoting its "[ China
Model](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/the-china-model?sref=BthlAIW9)"
of rapid economic development under one-party rule; [[most]{.mark} other
[countries know]{.mark} that [China's]{.mark} economic [success]{.mark}
would [be hard to replicate]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the height of
the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet communism inspired
revolutions around the world. Today, [the few countries that pay lip
service to the China Model do so to win economic favors from Beijing.
The real ideological threat to the U.S.]{.underline} --- the political
[authoritarianism embodied by]{.underline} former President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} and his followers --- [lies within its own
borders.]{.underline}

What about the prospect of China becoming the world's largest economy in
dollar terms? Measured in real terms (or purchasing power parity), the
Chinese
economy [surpassed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-24899) America's
in 2014 without eroding U.S. leadership in global finance and
technology, or undermining U.S. prosperity.

Judging the Chinese threat by the size of China's economy (the amount of
goods and services it produces) is also misleading because its
population is more than four times larger than that of the U.S.
Aggregate wealth and technological capabilities are far more meaningful
yardsticks of power.

Compared with China, the U.S. remains a solid leader in both. U.S.
households held [\$130
trillion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-wealth/u-s-households-ended-2020-with-record-130-2-trillion-in-wealth-fed-says-idUSKBN2B32H5) in
wealth at the end of 2020, while Credit Suisse estimates that Chinese
household wealth in mid-2020 stood at \$82 trillion.

[[Technologically]{.underline}]{.mark}, while China has made impressive
strides in recent years, [the [U.S. continues to lead]{.mark} in key
areas. The recent tech [trade war]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two
countries [[exposed]{.mark} just [how vulnerable
China]{.mark}]{.underline} --- not the U.S. --- [[is]{.mark}. U.S.
sanctions have crippled China's telecom giant Huawei]{.underline}
Technologies Co. and cast a shadow over the entire Chinese tech sector.
[Even China's]{.underline} impressive recent [Mars landing depended on
technology comparable to what NASA was using in 2003.]{.underline}

None of this even takes into account [[China's]{.mark} manifold
[internal weaknesses]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [range
from]{.underline} rapid [[demographic deterioration]{.mark} to [social
unrest]{.mark}, ethnic [tensions and]{.mark} an inefficient
[state-capitalist]{.mark} system. All [will limit]{.mark} the
[growth]{.mark} of Chinese power.]{.underline}

#### China is structurally constrained\-\--they speak loudly without carrying a big stick. 

**Weiss 23**, Professor of Government, Cornell University, Senior Fellow
at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis
(Jessica Chen Weiss, May 4, 2023, "Even China Isn't Convinced It Can
Replace the U.S.," New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/opinion/china-us-world-order.html)

Leading [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} intellectuals [openly
[acknowledge]{.mark} the [difficulty]{.mark} of [reconciling what China
says with what it does]{.mark}. "Even we don't believe much of what we
say,"]{.underline} the Chinese economist Yao Yang, who is known for his
pragmatic views, has said. "Our goal is not to defeat liberalism, but
instead to say that what we have can be as good as what you have." Jiang
Shigong, a legal scholar and apologist for Mr. Xi's political
philosophy, has written that "'socialism' is not ossified dogma, but
instead an open concept awaiting exploration and definition."

China's long-term ambitions are difficult to know with certainty, and
they can change. But [[it is far from clear]{.mark} that [it
can]{.mark}]{.underline} --- or even seeks to --- [[replace]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as the]{.mark} world's [dominant
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Mr. Xi and the C.C.P. apparently see the United States as trying to keep
China perpetually subordinate and vulnerable, opposing whatever China
does or advocates in an international system that Beijing believes
favors the United States and developed democracies. But at a minimum,
China seems more intent on modifying aspects of a system under which it
has prospered --- making it safer for autocracy --- rather than
replacing it.

Mr. Xi often couches this effort in his political slogans like the
"China dream" and a "shared future for humankind." But there is
continuing debate in China over what these visions really mean and what
costs and risks China should accept in seeking global leadership.
China's overseas development largess, for example, is limited by the
imperative of addressing its own persistent development needs at home,
research by the scholar Min Ye has shown. Same for other key Chinese
strategies for widening its influence: Its efforts to internationalize
the renminbi and reduce dollar dominance are constrained by the tight
grip it keeps on the currency's value, as well as other capital
controls. These policies help stabilize its economy and prevent capital
flight, but they limit the renminbi's global appeal.

U.S. concerns often center on the legitimate fear that China could
attack Taiwan. But despite menacing Chinese military exercises meant to
deter the self-ruled island from moving closer to formal independence,
many experts believe that Beijing still prefers to achieve its
longstanding objective of "peaceful reunification" through measures
short of war. China could lose in a war and face international sanctions
and supply chain disruptions. These would be economically and
politically devastating, jeopardizing Mr. Xi's prime objectives of
regime security, domestic stability and national rejuvenation.

[Doubts are growing that China, [facing economic headwinds and]{.mark} a
[shrinking population]{.mark}, can achieve its goal of surpassing the
United States]{.underline} as the world's largest economy, let alone
other metrics of global leadership. There is broad recognition in
[China]{.underline} that it [[remains militarily]{.mark}, economically
[and technologically weaker]{.mark} than the United States]{.underline}
and that further modernization depends upon continued access to
international technology, capital and markets within a stable economic
order. "It is impossible for America to contain the rise of China," the
influential Chinese scholar Huang Renwei has noted, "and it is equally
impossible for China to quickly surpass America."

Chinese rhetoric about global governance reform has resonated in many
developing countries that also see international institutions as tilted
against them. But [there is [little reason]{.mark} to believe that the
[C.C.P.]{.mark}'s]{.underline} self-serving, [[nationalist ideology will
captivate the world]{.mark}, especially [as]{.mark} Mr. [Xi feeds
mistrust with]{.mark} his [authoritarian]{.mark} ways, coercive [tactics
against]{.mark} foreign [businesses and trading
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}, and policies that increasingly smack of
paranoia. China tends to be viewed more favorably in parts of the
developing world. But that owes more to economics than to ideas, and its
overseas [[investments]{.mark} have often [been criticized for]{.mark}
lacking [transparency, saddling]{.mark} poor [countries with
debt]{.mark}, as well as environmental and other concerns.]{.underline}

#### China's "dream" is gone\-\--too economically weak. 

**Linden 23**, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University
of Pittsburgh (Robert Linden, April 3, 2023, "Is the Chinese Dream
Turning into a Chinese Nightmare for Beijing?" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinese-dream-turning-chinese-nightmare-beijing-206374?page=0%2C1)

Far from being astride the globe, [[the "China Dream"]{.mark}
globally---China's economic power, political attraction, and
standing---[are]{.mark} all [eroding]{.mark}]{.underline}. Several key
indicators reveal that, in the epic clash with the United States and the
"collective West," [China is weaker than at any time]{.underline} in the
last ten years.

Consider the economic dimensions for starters. A key instrument of great
power influence has long been foreign direct investment (FDI), something
that is also crucial for China's own economic health. Spurred by its
2001 "Go Out" policy and supercharged [[with]{.mark} the]{.underline}
Belt and Road Initiative [([BRI]{.mark}) [in 2013,
Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} outward [[FDI grew]{.mark}
steadily]{.underline}, from \$10 billion in 2005 to more than \$170
billion by 2017. [[Since]{.mark} then]{.underline}, four of [the
[last]{.mark}]{.underline} five [[years]{.mark} have [seen drops
in]{.mark} outward [FDI]{.mark}---including a 15 percent fall in
2022]{.underline}, according to the American Enterprise Institute.
[[Chinese investment]{.underline}]{.mark} into Europe, previously a
choice location because of its high value-added manufacturing capacity
and weak regulation, [[fell sharply]{.mark} as well. Once eager
[partners]{.mark}]{.underline} like Germany, Italy, and the EU itself
[have [adopted]{.mark}]{.underline} or strengthened [investment
[screening]{.mark}]{.underline} mechanisms [[and blocked]{.mark} key
Chinese [acquisitions]{.mark}]{.underline}. A mutual investment treaty
that is supposed to address chronic business complaints about Chinese
practices and restrictions has stalled in the European Parliament due to
widespread Chinese human rights violations and tit-for-tat individual
sanctions. Viewed in the other direction, European investment into China
dropped steadily after 2018 until rebounding last year. But as [Rhodium
Group figures show](https://rhg.com/research/the-chosen-few/), FDI
inflow to China has become concentrated to the point where almost 90
percent of European FDI in China comes from only four countries. During
the coronavirus pandemic, the Rhodium report notes, "virtually no
European investors that were not already present in the country have
made direct investments." The impact of European investment, which had
in 2018 accounted for 7.5 percent of Chinese GDP, fell to 2.8 percent
three years later.

The most serious challenge to Chinese economic clout has come from the
United States. [Heightened [tariffs]{.mark} and
restrictions]{.underline} put in place during the Trump administration
[have [continued under]{.mark} Joe [Biden]{.mark}]{.underline}. Reviews
of foreign (read: Chinese) investments have broadened, as have policies
[[blocking]{.mark} the sale of high-[tech goods to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}---not only from the United States, but also
from companies in other countries whose goods have U.S. components.
Washington redoubled its efforts to block Huawei and TikTok, along with
passing legislation to subsidize U.S. production of high-tech goods at
home and direct "friendshoring" investments to reliable allies and
partners.

As an economic colossus, China has alternatives, especially [[in Asia,
Africa]{.mark}, and other places]{.underline} where it claims to offer
an alternative development model. But here, too, [[China's
presence]{.mark} has [run out of steam]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Annual [investments]{.mark}]{.underline} in the countries of the BRI,
once the flagship vehicle for the extension of Chinese influence,
[[are]{.mark} today [less than half of]{.mark} what they were only [five
years ago]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[most]{.mark} of that is [in
countries with]{.mark} serious [debt]{.mark} issues]{.underline}. As a
report in Foreign Policy put it, "China can make friends or break legs.
It can't do both."

#### Structural constraints prevent both force projection and soft power influence\-\--containment not required.

Fellow, CATO Institute (John Mueller, January 11, 2022, "China Has Been
a Failure at Hegemony, So Let's Just Chill," CATO Institute,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/china-has-been-failure-hegemony-so-lets-just-chill)

[[Many]{.underline}]{.mark} in the U.S. foreign policy establishment and
elsewhere [[are sounding]{.mark} an [alarm over]{.mark}]{.underline}
concerns that, as [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} develops, it
will [become](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-10-19/inevitable-rivalry-cold-war) the
dominant power in its region, [a ["hegemon"]{.mark} that
will]{.underline} have too much "influence" there and do [damage to U.S.
security interests]{.underline}. For example, in 2017 the National
Intelligence
Council [opined](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/nic/GT-Full-Report.pdf) that
"geopolitical competition" was on the rise and the Chinese sought "to
exert more sway over their neighboring regions and promote an order in
which U.S. influence does not dominate."

Accordingly, as it is
often [suggested](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Denial-American-Defense-Conflict/dp/0300256434),
military hardware must be deployed to somehow keep that from happening.

[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, to a degree, [[we already know what
Chinese "hegemony" looks like]{.underline}]{.mark}. Over the last
decade, China has established a major military and especially economic
presence, and it has tried to convert this condition into influence.
These experiments in hegemony --- China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
which has stressed construction loans to countries across Eurasia, and
its rather belligerent "wolf diplomacy" antics --- have substantially
foundered and have, if anything, proved to be counterproductive. The
experience does not bode well for future efforts, and it does not
justify alarm.

Its much‐​hyped [[B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad
[I]{.mark}nitiative]{.underline}
was [once](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/china-has-a-plan-to-rule-the-world/2017/11/28/214299aa-d472-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html) [deemed](https://www.amazon.com/Battlegrounds-Fight-Defend-Free-World/dp/0062899465) by
some to be a key element of a plot by the Chinese to "rule the world."
However, from the beginning there
were [warnings](https://www.cfr.org/book/third-revolution) from Chinese
scholars and business leaders questioning the economic rationale for
many of the investments. In addition, economist Barry Naughton of the
University of California at San
Diego [notes](https://www.amazon.com/Fateful-Decisions-Shorenstein-Asia-Pacific-Research-ebook/dp/B086ZXCBNY) that
the idea was in part economically misguided, and Tufts University's
Michael Beckley
has [estimated](https://www.amazon.com/Unrivaled-America-Superpower-Cornell-Security/dp/1501724789) that
the scheme would "probably exacerbate China's woes" by funding "hundreds
of financially dubious projects in unstable countries, more than half of
which have credit ratings below investment‐​grade."

These suggestions have proved to be justified. Expenditures of hundreds
of billions on the project [have [failed to deliver]{.mark} either
[returns]{.mark} for investors]{.underline} (including state‐​run banks)
[or political returns for
China]{.underline}, [notes](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/bri-china-belt-road-initiative-blunder/?utm_source=PostUp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=China%20Brief%20OC&utm_term=37767&tpcc=China%20Brief%20OC) Taiwan‐​based
analyst Tanner Green. [The project was there]{.underline}, he says,
"[only because it is the favored brainchild of an]{.underline}
authoritarian leader living in an [echo chamber]{.underline}" --- for
other Chinese to attack BRI is "to attack the legitimacy of the party
itself."

By 2019, [BRI [lending]{.mark}]{.underline} by China
[had [[fallen](https://www.ft.com/content/d9bd8059-d05c-4e6f-968b-1672241ec1f6) from]{.mark}
a peak of [\$75 billion]{.mark} in 2016]{.underline} (at a time when its
promulgating author, Chinese President Xi Jinping, was touting BRI as "a
project of the century") [[to just \$4]{.mark} billion]{.underline}.
Although some of these projects will likely succeed, there were reports
by the end of 2020, like this one by James Kynge and Jonathan Wheatley
at the Financial Times, that the money had often been doled out "with
a combination of hubris, ambition, and naivete." Descriptors like
"unravelling," "fallen off a cliff," and "ill‐​conceived" were being
applied by experts, including Matt Ferchen at Merics, a Berlin‐​based
think‐​tank, who wrote that China was now "mired in debt renegotiations
with a host of countries." 

In fact, as Stanford's Elizabeth Economy notes, there has been something
of a backlash and "stories of [Chinese [corruption and scandals]{.mark}
with infrastructure projects [are contributing]{.mark}]{.underline} to
rising Sinophobia." China has shot
back [saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/30/critics-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-are-prejudiced-diplomat.html) critics
are "prejudiced" and lacking "objectivity and a fair understanding" of
the initiative; others have sought to play down criticisms of
Chinese labor practices or accusations of [debt
traps](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy). 

Rising concerns have nonetheless pushed the European Union to launch
a global investment project that is apparently intended to be a counter
to China's BRI, and the United States seems to want to
follow [suit](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/29/biden-build-back-better-world-belt-road-initiative/).
But, as Foreign Policy's James Palmer noted recently, "all this feels
both outdated and unnecessary," pointing out that "the heyday of BRI
hype, even in China, was at least three years ago," while the current
focus is on the "white elephant nature of projects and the relative lack
of deliverables for China."

China's clumsy "wolf warrior" diplomacy of recent years has also failed
to deliver. As Stanford's Thomas
Fingar [notes](https://www.amazon.com/Fateful-Decisions-Shorenstein-Asia-Pacific-Research-ebook/dp/B086ZXCBNY),
"muscular displays of [Chinese [military power]{.mark} may have [been
intended to dissuade]{.mark} neighboring [countries from lending support
to]{.mark} imputed [U.S.]{.mark} military planning]{.underline}, but
they seriously undercut efforts to reassure other countries that they
had no reason to fear China's 'peaceful rise.'"

Moreover, [they [have pushed]{.mark} countries]{.underline} it sought to
intimidate, [such as [Japan, India, So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, [and
Australia, to become]{.mark} far [more hostile]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thus, historian Arne Westad [points
out](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-08-12/sources-chinese-conduct) that
the efforts "have all backfired: East Asia is much warier of Chinese
aims today than it was a decade ago," and he cites a [Pew Research
Center
poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/pg_2020-10-06_global-views-china_0-01/) showing
the percentage of South Koreans who viewed China's rise favorably fell
from 66 percent in 2002 to 34 percent in 2017. In Australia the
percentage trusting China to act responsibly in the
world [dropped](https://poll.lowyinstitute.org/themes/china/) from 52
percent to 16 percent between 2018 and 2021.

As David Shambaugh, a China specialist at George Washington
University, [concludes](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190062316.001.0001/oso-9780190062316-chapter-16):
"If Beijing is trying to recreate a twenty‐​first‐​century version of the
imperial 'tribute system,' it will inevitably fail, as [other sovereign
[Asian nations do not desire]{.mark} to fall into [such]{.mark}
a]{.underline} patron‐​client [[relationship with
China]{.underline}]{.mark} again."

Fingar and Jean
Oi [summarize](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0163660X.2020.1734304) the
situation: "China's relationship with more or less all countries is more
fraught today than it was before Xi launched the BRI and China began to
flex its economic and military muscles in ways neighbors found
worrisome."

More broadly, these experiences suggest (as was seen [as
well](https://www.amazon.com/Stupidity-War-American-Foreign-Complacency/dp/1108843832) in
the Cold War) that [[containment is scarcely
required]{.underline}]{.mark} because political "dominance" (such as it
is) does not flow naturally from economic or military growth.

#### Grid damage is reversible, and [segmentation]{.underline} prevents cascades

**Lambert 23**, citing **Daniel Brooks**, MS, vice president of
integrated grid and energy systems at EPRI, a nonprofit research and
development institute. (Hannah Ray, 1-16-2023, \"What is the national
power grid and how resilient is it?\", Fox News,
https://www.foxnews.com/us/national-power-grid-resilient)

Historic weather events, cyberattacks and even physical assaults on
power stations have raised concerns about the vulnerability of the
nation\'s electric grid.

But what exactly is the grid and how resilient is it against threats of
all kinds?

[The grid is made up of power generators]{.underline} --- such as dams,
coal plants or wind turbines --- [and more than five million miles of
power lines]{.underline} carrying electricity all over the country,
according to the vice president of integrated grid and energy systems at
EPRI, a nonprofit research and development institute.

\"All of that is working together to make sure that when you flip that
switch on in your house, the light comes on just then,\" Daniel Brooks
said. \"So it\'s pretty complicated.\"

[Overall, [the grid is \"extremely reliable,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} he
said. But with more of the U.S. electrified than at any other point in
history, the grid also faces more threats.

\"We\'ve seen an increasing number of what folks would call a
one-in-100-year type of event,\" Brooks told Fox News.

Extreme weather events like record-breaking wildfires in California,
hurricanes and powerful winter storms have become larger considerations
for grid planners, Brooks said. But weather is not the only concern.

WHAT IS IT? THE NATIONAL POWER GRID:

\"There are bad guys out there that would like to be able to leverage
vulnerabilities that they could find with cyber or maybe physical
security,\" Brooks said.

Gunfire erupted this week at a substation in Randolph County, North
Carolina. While it did not cause any outages, it comes less than two
months after more than 40,000 electric customers in North Carolina were
left in the dark after someone shot at two substations.

On Christmas morning, vandals struck four substations in Washington,
knocking out power to about 15,000 customers. Pundits and activists soon
speculated whether the increase in attacks on power stations could be
the work of \"right-wing extremists.\"

The motive in both North Carolina cases remains unknown and no one has
been arrested. But the men now charged with attacking the substations in
Washington allegedly planned to commit a burglary while the power was
out.

\"Those aren\'t the normal events that we actually design and operate
the grid through,\" Brooks said.

But [grid planners]{.underline} \"[really want to avoid any]{.underline}
type of [event that could result in a long duration
outage]{.underline},\" which could threaten peoples\' health and safety,
he added.

[Transmission [towers have become]{.mark} increasingly [hardened against
winds]{.mark}]{.underline}, he said. [Some power [lines are designed
so]{.mark} that if a tree]{.underline} limb [falls across them, the
[lines drop away]{.mark} from the pole rather [than dragging down the
entire pole]{.mark}]{.underline} which would take much longer to fix.

\"[Part of resiliency is making sure]{.underline} that [[we don\'t
get]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[long duration outages by putting in
systems that allow us to]{.underline}]{.mark} be able to [[recover
quickly]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he said.

National power grid three regional interconnections

[[The]{.mark} national]{.underline} power [[grid is]{.mark} actually
[made up of three]{.mark}]{.underline} loosely-connected
[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [That\'s good news when it comes to
resiliency because [it means if there\'s a]{.mark} serious [problem in
the West]{.mark}]{.underline}ern interconnection, [[the
East]{.underline}]{.mark}ern U.S. [[should be fine]{.underline}]{.mark},
Brooks said.

\"[[An issue that]{.mark} starts to happen]{.underline} and hopefully
[[would never]{.mark} actually [cascade into a]{.mark} complete
[blackout]{.mark}, [that wouldn\'t go beyond those individual
grids]{.mark},\"]{.underline} he said.

A diverse array of power sources is also key to grid resiliency, Brooks
said. Solar power might perform well during the day, but the benefits
vanish when the sun does, so other resources such as nuclear, gas or
coal might pick up the slack.

#### No blackouts.

**Koerth 18**, Senior Science Writer for FiveThirtyEight, citing Bill
Lawrence, a Vice President and Chief Security Officer at the North
American Electric Reliability Corporation (Maggie Koerth, August 13,
2018, "Hacking The Electric Grid Is Damned Hard," 538,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hacking-the-electric-grid-is-damned-hard/)

Representatives from two nonprofit organizations --- both of which play
large roles in how the electric grid is regulated and maintained ---
said it is easier to imagine disaster scenarios than create one.
"There've been some very sensational books out there about the grid
going dark because someone's got their finger ready over a mouse and
everything is going to turn off at the same time," said Bill Lawrence,
vice president and chief security officer at the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, the regulatory authority that sets and enforces
technological standards for utility companies across the continent. "The
grid does not work that way." [[Our]{.mark} electric
[infra]{.mark}structure [is chock-full of]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[[redundancies and]{.mark} regional [variations]{.mark} --- two things
[that impede widespread sabotage]{.mark}.]{.underline}

That's not to say that the grid isn't under attack. Lawrence
acknowledged that there is interest in "trying to hurt us from a
distance." But he emphasized there have not yet been
any successful attacks --- meaning hackers haven't caused any blackouts.

They've been poking at our critical infrastructure for a long while.
Incident reports published by the Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team --- a division of Homeland Security that does
training and responds to cyberattacks on critical infrastructure ---
suggest that electricity, oil and natural gas infrastructure have been
routinely targeted for years.1 There are dozens of these attacks
reported to ICS-CERTS annually.

However, [it would be difficult]{.underline} for these attacks [to lead
to wide-scale blackouts]{.underline}, according to Lawrence and Candace
Suh-Lee, who leads a cybersecurity research team at the Electric Power
Research Institute, a nonprofit research and development lab. And that's
true even if hackers do eventually succeed in taking control of some
electric systems.

It helps that [[the]{.mark} North [American]{.mark} electric [grid
is]{.mark} both [diverse in]{.mark} its [engineering and
redundant]{.mark} in its design]{.underline}. For instance, the
Ukrainian attacks are often cited as evidence that hundreds of thousands
of Americans could suddenly find themselves in the dark because of
hackers. But Lawrence considers the Ukrainian grid a lot easier to
infiltrate than the North American one. That's because Ukraine's
infrastructure is more homogeneous, the result of electrification
happening under the standardizing eye of the former Soviet Union, he
told me. [The North American grid]{.underline}, in contrast, [began as
[a patchwork of unconnected]{.mark} electric [islands]{.mark}, each
[designed]{.mark} and built [by companies]{.mark} that [weren't
coordinating]{.mark} with one another]{.underline}. Even today, he said,
[the enforceable [standards]{.mark}]{.underline} set by NERC [[don't
tell you]{.mark} exactly [what to buy]{.mark}]{.underline} or how to
build. "So [[taking down one]{.mark} utility [and going]{.mark} right
[next door and doing the same]{.mark} thing]{.underline} to that
neighboring utility [[would be]{.mark} an extremely [difficult]{.mark}
challenge]{.underline}," he said.

Meanwhile, [[the]{.mark} electric [grid]{.mark} already
[contains]{.mark} a lot of [redundancies]{.mark}]{.underline} that are
built in to prevent blackouts caused by common problems like broken tree
limbs or heat waves --- and those redundancies would also help to
prevent a successful cyberattack from affecting a large number of
people. Suh-Lee pointed to an August 2003 blackout that turned the
lights off on 50 million people on the east coast of the U.S. and
Canada. "When we analyzed it, there was about 17 different things lined
up that went wrong. Then it happened," she said. Hackers wouldn't
necessarily have control over all the things that would have to go wrong
to create a blackout like that.

### AT: China War !\-\--1NC

#### No China war or adventurism. 

**Nolt 24**, PhD, Adjunct Professor at New York University, Senior
Fellow at the World Policy Institute. (James H., 1-29-2024, \"Geography
Limits China's Possibilities as a Sea Power,\" China-US Focus,
https://www.chinausfocus.com/peace-security/geography-limits-chinas-possibilities-as-a-sea-power)

Despite some easing of U.S.-China tensions, [there remains a steady
drumbeat of pundit]{.underline} and politician [warnings about the
supposed dire military threat from China]{.underline}. [I have been
publishing articles on the military balance [in]{.mark} East
[Asia]{.mark} for nearly three decades]{.underline}, each one refuting
the notion that the threat of Chinese aggression is imminent; [[peace
prevails]{.underline}]{.mark}, as I predicted.

[[The reasons are]{.mark} several: [nuclear
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [vastly greater]{.mark} [military
spending of the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and its allies, [[a balance of
forces that favors US heg]{.underline}]{.mark}emony in the air and on
the sea, the [[lack of]{.mark} serious [Chinese intent to
launch]{.mark}]{.underline} a career of
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which is
[illustrated]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
actions---[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} steady and fairly [[low
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}age [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[GDP
spent on military]{.mark} preparations]{.underline}---than by sometimes
muscular rhetoric, etc. However, [there is one major consideration
seldom acknowledged that makes China's capacity to project
power]{.underline} forcefully [far weaker]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} less sensitive to marginal changes in the
balance of power that is largely ignored:
[[geography]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Like Russia, Germany and the former Austria-Hungary, [China is largely
landlocked]{.underline}. No matter how big a navy Germany tried to
build, Britain stood as an unassailable fortress astride its sea lines
of communication, easily able to intercept its warships and interdict
its trade. Even during World War Two, when Germany gained the ports of
France, its ability to operate submarines across the Atlantic improved,
but its trade outside the Baltic remained severed. Most of its large
warships were lost during futile attempts to operate past Britain. The
USSR was similarly constrained geographically by the US and its many
allies during the Cold War. Its fleet was divided into four
geographically isolated parts, none of which had free access to open
ocean without passing dangerously near U.S. allies and bases. Overseas
trade for the USSR during wartime would have been hopeless. Even against
a much smaller power, Japan, during their 1904-05 war, Russia could not
concentrate its much larger fleet. Its Pacific bases were easily
blockaded by Japanese naval forces. These powers were all constrained
from being sea powers, not just by the unfavorable balance of forces,
but even more by geographical barriers.

Military propagandists largely neglect these geographical realities. It
is long been said that China is building a "blue water navy" capable of
traversing the world's oceans as a great power. Yes, but only in peace
time. [[The day]{.mark} that [any]{.mark} major [war breaks out, China's
overseas trade stops]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Its
ports]{.underline}]{.mark}, [but not those of its
adversaries]{.underline}, [[are instantly
blockaded]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any warships outside its home waters
would be tracked down and sunk. This geographical fact is insensitive to
the balance of forces. [China's navy could be five times as big; it
still would not]{.underline} [be a]{.underline} true [blue water navy
because during a]{.underline} shooting [war its fleet would be
vulnerable even in its own]{.underline} coastal waters, yet also unable
to venture into the open seas without catastrophic losses. This is
similar to Germany's situation in both world wars.

There is a very important reason [geography is even more constraining
today]{.underline} than it would have been a century ago: [air power
trumps sea power]{.underline}. World War Two proved that surface navies
cannot operate safely outside the cover of friendly air power. Only
three navies then, the American, British, and Japanese, operated enough
aircraft carriers to venture near enemy land-based air control. During
1943, with irreplaceable losses of aircraft carriers and veteran pilots,
plus the American completion of large classes of new carriers, the
far-flung Japanese Empire lost the capacity to defend its own internal
shipping lanes, island bases, and surface navy. Its defeat became
inevitable.

[The lessons of naval combat since World War Two have only further
amplified air power dominance]{.underline}. New forms of land-based air
power, including drones and anti-shipping missiles (ASMs), are ever more
cost-effective additions to the arsenals of land-powers geographically
able to interdict sea trade and naval operations. Most pundits have
missed this as well, or even gotten it backwards.

Most recently, [the Houthi attacks on shipping]{.underline} through the
vital Red Sea have [been used to exaggerate the potential Chinese threat
to shipping]{.underline} in the event of a war in East Asia. Once again,
[geography is ignored]{.underline}. [The Houthi forces are astride a
very narrow part of the shortest route from Europe to Asia]{.underline}.
Shipping can divert around Africa, but the route is much longer and thus
more expensive. [China does have ASMs and drones]{.underline} in
abundance, [but most can only reach its own coastal waters]{.underline},
[which are critical for its own shipping]{.underline}---and
Taiwan's[---but not anybody else's]{.underline}. [Ships from Japan or
So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea [that now pass through the
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [could easily
divert east of the Philippines]{.underline}, out of range of air power
based in China. China's geographical situation lacks the Houthi
advantage.

[Even Chinese sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline} [would be vulnerable
to air power]{.underline} outside the protection of their land-based
fighter aircraft, which reach only about 500 kilometers from its land
bases. [[China's few]{.mark} aircraft [carriers]{.mark}]{.underline}
with small fighter forces embarked [[would have a hard time defending
themselves]{.mark} from land-based air attacks]{.underline}---let alone
from any of the larger and far more numerous U.S. aircraft carriers---to
be of much use, except perhaps against an especially weak regional
power.

[The effectiveness of the Houthi]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} also
of [Ukraine]{.underline} [against the Russian Black Sea
fleet]{.underline}---[underlines China's]{.underline} own greater
[vulnerability to the new generation of naval weapons]{.underline},
drones and ASMs, in addition to conventional air power. [Chinese
[warships]{.mark}]{.underline}, not to mention transports carrying
troops for any seaborne invasion, such as against Taiwan, [[are
vulnerable even within its own]{.mark} coastal
[waters]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such aerial weapons are relatively
inexpensive]{.underline}, highly [accurate]{.underline}, easy to hide,
[and not]{.underline} so [easy to intercept]{.underline}. This was
demonstrated by [[the handful of Ukrainian missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[destroyed]{.mark} most]{.underline} of the major [[Russian
warships]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Black Sea, which were defended as
well as Chinese ships would be. Even a power controlling the air has
considerable difficulty finding and suppressing ASMs and drones before
they can be launched. Taiwan has a vastly larger arsenal of ASMs than
does Ukraine. Furthermore, in the event of a crisis in the Taiwan
Straits, the U.S. could rapidly airlift additional supplies to Taiwan,
largely neutralizing any Chinese invasion threat. In any case, [[China's
amphibious lift]{.underline}]{.mark} [capability [is]{.mark} [too
small]{.mark} to transport and supply a force anywhere near large enough
to overcome Taiwan's ground forces]{.underline}. Effectively, China is
constrained by geography. Given this, the balance of forces and
capabilities is not sensitive to incremental developments.

### AT: China War !\-\--2NC

#### No China war. 

**von Sydow 24**, a China analyst at Swedish National China Centre.
(Alexis, 2-23-2024, "Most Experts Agree: China Isn't About to Invade
Taiwan," The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2024/02/most-experts-agree-china-isnt-about-to-invade-taiwan/)

[[Alarmist]{.mark} commentators [overestimate]{.mark} the [risk of
war]{.mark} in]{.underline} at least [three important ways]{.underline}.

First, it is often stated that China is arming itself specifically in
preparation for a Taiwan invasion. 2027 often figures as a possible date
for such an invasion, presumably because this year is an official
milestone in the Chinese military's modernization plans. But the year
2027 hardly figures at all in the scholarly forecasts we have examined. 

Concerning China's military modernization, forecasts do point to growing
risk, but this is mainly a question of the gradually changing military
balance vis-a-vis the United States in the region. [A more even military
balance]{.underline} inherently means growing risk, but that risk [is
growing from a very low baseline probability. It is still true that
[China cannot be confident to win a war]{.mark} with the U.S. over
Taiwan, which keeps down the risk]{.underline} for the present.

Second, it is said that China cannot accept Taiwan's democratic
institutions, and that conflict can only be averted by the United States
and other allies stepping up explicit support for Taiwan's independence.
But forecasts instead point to the worsening China-U.S. relationship
itself as one of the major risk factors. Growing tensions over Taiwan
are a consequence of increasing great power conflict. [[Beijing sees
Taiwan as]{.mark} a [part of]{.mark} the [U.S.
s]{.mark}]{.underline}phere [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nfluence, [[and knows]{.mark} that an
[attack]{.mark} on Taiwan [is a]{.mark} military [attack on U.S.]{.mark}
interests]{.underline}. If [China-U.S. [rivalry is kept within limits,
China has little interest in provoking]{.mark} such a
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Third, a common narrative among alarmists is the story of the changing
Chinese regime. They warn us of China's increasingly aggressive posture,
its growing "assertiveness," and an alleged ideological turn away from
"openness" under the rule of Xi Jinping. By contrast, forecasters are
divided on the question of whether China's intentions concerning Taiwan
have changed in any crucial regard. Xi Jinping hews close to the
traditional Communist Party line of unquestioned sovereignty over
Taiwan, and his international ambitions are likewise inherited from his
predecessors. Most of China's new-found "assertiveness" is likely less a
matter of ideological change and more a matter of growing capabilities.
From this, one might conclude that assumptions of extreme urgency on
China's part are faulty.  

These are the takeaways from available forecasts, and they stand in
stark contrast to alarmist predictions from the U.S. military and other
actors. They suggest that alarmist narratives are arrived at by looking
at the growing risk of war in isolation, without consideration of its
general low baseline probability. Alarmists also tend to heavily
exaggerate the degree of internal change caused by Xi Jinping, which is
a factor that appears doubtful when aggregating forecasts.

Moreover, even though available forecasts rate the risk of war as low,
they might still be overestimating it. This is because all these
forecasts are found in works that study military issues and political
attitudes. [But [other things matter]{.mark}, too. [Taiwan's]{.mark}
crucial [role in]{.mark} the [semiconductor]{.mark} industry is well
known, and destroying these supply chains [would cost]{.mark} the world
economy [trillions]{.mark} of dollars per year. On top of this comes the
effects of the [economic warfare]{.mark} that almost certainly [would
result]{.mark} if China attacked Taiwan. Most [estimates
conclude]{.mark} that such [consequences would hit China]{.mark} even
[harder]{.mark} than the West. It is hard to imagine that China does not
realize this or refuses to take it into account when weighing the
possibility of using force]{.underline}. This should further subtract
from the generally low level of risk estimated by the forecasts we have
reviewed.

All of this taken together suggests that [a [mix of]{.mark} military and
economic [deterrence, together with a]{.mark} responsibly
[managed]{.mark} China-U.S. [relationship]{.mark}, can be expected to
[effectively prevent conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} even in the future.
Most importantly, [discussions of a possible Taiwan conflict should
proceed from an understanding of the low baseline probability of such a
scenario, not from panic-driven "when-rather-than-if"
takes]{.underline}.

University. (David, 7-8-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 9: Biorisk
-- Grounds for doubt),\" Reflective altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/07/08/exaggerating-the-risks-part-9-biorisk-grounds-for-doubt/)

In the meantime, I want to give some initial reasons for skepticism
about existential biorisk. That is not to say that the bulk of the case
against existential biorisk rests on these reasons for skepticism -- it
rests, instead, on the inability of effective altruists to provide
plausible arguments in support of their risk estimates. But it does seem
appropriate to begin by saying why [[many are skeptical of existential
biorisk]{.underline}]{.mark} claims.

3\. The difficulty of the problem

The main reason why scientists and policymakers are skeptical of
existential biorisk is that [it is terribly hard to engineer a pandemic
that kills everyone]{.underline}.

First, [[you would need to reach everyone]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
virus would have to be transmitted to the most rural and isolated
corners]{.underline} of the earth; to [[antarctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
research [[stations]{.underline}]{.mark}; to [[ships]{.mark} at
sea]{.underline}, [including [nuclear
sub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} on uncharted,
long-term and isolated paths; to [doomsday [preppers]{.mark}
in]{.underline} their [bunkers]{.underline}; to hermits and
[[uncontacted tribes]{.underline}]{.mark}; to [[astronauts]{.mark} in
space]{.underline}; to each new child born every second; [to island
nations]{.underline}; and so on. And you would need a transmission
mechanism that could spread the virus this far without being detected:
otherwise, [those with the means would be whisked away to
safety]{.underline} and might well survive.

Second, [[you would need a virus that was]{.mark} virtually
[undetectable]{.mark} until all]{.underline}, or [nearly all humans had
been infected]{.underline}. That conflicts in a stark way with the goal
of producing a virus that is 100% lethal, since lethal viruses tend to
leave a trace as they spread through a population.

Third, [you would need a virus that is unprecedentedly
infectious]{.underline}. [[The virus would need to be]{.mark} capable of
being [transmitted]{.mark}, without fail]{.underline}, [[to every
human]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[on the planet]{.underline}]{.mark},
in sufficient quantities to actually make them sick. [It would need to
[avoid respirators]{.mark}]{.underline} and other forms of protective
equipment. [[And]{.mark} it would have to [maintain]{.mark} its
[transmissibility through]{.mark}out many generations]{.underline} of
[[mutation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Fourth, [you would need a virus that is unprecedentedly
lethal]{.underline}, [[killing not]{.underline}]{.mark} 90%,
[[99%]{.underline}]{.mark}, or 99.999% [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
effectively [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} of those infected by it, [[no
matter their]{.mark} age, health, or [genetic
makeup]{.mark}]{.underline}. This lethality would need to be preserved
even against the best medical treatments, including quite possibly
vaccines or synthesized antibodies. And it would have to be maintained
throughout many generations of mutation despite selective pressures
towards less lethal variants.

Fifth, [[you would need to]{.underline}]{.mark} find a way to
[[evade]{.mark} basic public health measures such as masking and social
[distancing]{.mark}. This isn't as easy as it sounds. [How do you
transmit a virus to someone who doesn't leave their
house?]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### China won't deploy geoengineering.

environmental frame: The intelligible 'emergency' techno-fix and
preemptive security," European Journal of International Security, Vol.
8, pp. 262--280, University of Kansas Libraries, Pro Quest)

China, and to a lesser extent, India are frequently mentioned as actors
who may be interested in SAI use, unilateral or otherwise due to their
size, economic and military capacity, and relative vulnerability to
climate change.117 Although India theoretically has incentive to engage
in unilateral SAI due to adverse climate impacts, research indicates
that SAI will impact monsoon and rainfall patterns particularly
important to the country and which make the prospect of SAI much less
appealing to India than it may be for China.118 China is concerned about
climate change vulnerabilities and maintaining its development
trajectory, which may make SAI an appealing intervention to extend the
window for bringing down reliance on fossil fuels for growth.119
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has a history
of]{.underline}]{.mark} engaging in large-scale engineering projects and
[[weather modification]{.underline}]{.mark} that may arguably make it
more comfortable with shifting into SAI deployment.120
[[However]{.mark}, China [has shown]{.mark} far [more interest
in]{.mark}]{.underline} CDR geoengineering [strategies like
[afforestation and]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[reluctance to explore
SRM]{.mark} strategies]{.underline},121 [[in addition to]{.mark} complex
geo[political challenges]{.mark} it would face [if it engaged]{.mark} in
SAI, particularly [with India and Australia]{.mark}]{.underline}.122
[[China]{.mark} appears to [have enough]{.mark} internal
[agreement]{.mark} that [climate]{.mark} change [is a]{.mark} serious
[problem]{.mark} for it [to mobilise]{.mark}]{.underline} political and
scientific efforts to [pursue]{.underline} longer-term, less immediately
[[impactful but]{.mark} also [less dangerous]{.mark} climate
[interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}.123 It is certainly not impossible
that China may engage in unilateral SAI in the event of a serious
environmental disaster, and it fits the profile sketched above of an
economically and militarily powerful country that may be able to evade
or withstand sanctions if it acted preemptively and unilaterally.
However, there is also a strong case to be made that the US is the actor
more likely to engage in unilateral geoengineering when broader
considerations beyond perceived environmental vulnerability are taken
into account.

#### States will cooperate, not fight, over geoengineering. 

**Horton 11**, PhD, Research Director of Geoengineering at Harvard.
(Joshua B., May 2011, "Geoengineering and the Myth of Unilateralism:
Pressures and Prospects for International Cooperation," Stanford Journal
of Law, Science & Policy Vol. IV, p. 65-67,
https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/horton.pdf)

Viewed in this way, [[the]{.mark} conventional [tendency to hear nuclear
echoes in]{.mark}]{.underline} contemporary [debates about
[geoengineering is turned on its head]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
governance challenges associated with SAI resemble the challenges
associated with arms control much more than the difficulties plaguing
nonproliferation efforts. With SAI and arms control, [[national
interests favor mutual accommodation]{.mark} and
coordination]{.underline}. With emissions mitigation and
nonproliferation, by contrast, national interests tend to diverge from
the collective interest, and hence international agreements are more
prone to breakdown. Disputes between nuclear weapons states and
non-nuclear weapons states are mirrored by debates between Annex I and
Annex II countries. [It is not]{.underline} SAI
[geoengineering]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather [mitigation
policy that is subject to]{.underline} the types of [malign
incentives]{.underline} typical of nuclear nonproliferation. Decades of
unsuccessful attempts to reduce global carbon emissions underscore this
similarity and explain the need to consider geoengineering in the first
place.

V. PROMOTING MULTILATERALISM

The benign problem structure underlying the question of SAI deployment
can be addressed through the use of a portfolio of tactics known to
political scientists as "international management theory." 44 Employing
these instruments facilitates the achievement of multilateral
coordination and effective international governance. By
[[using]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[policy levers]{.underline}]{.mark},
interested parties are able to [[overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely
those kinds of [[obstacles]{.mark} that currently impede global
coop]{.underline}eration on SAI. International management theorists cite
three strategies as key to solving interdependence problems.
[Persuasion]{.underline} helps redefine national interests so that
states favor international cooperation. [Pressure]{.underline} brings
national policies into alignment with harmonious interests. Finally,
[provision of assistance]{.underline} enables states to pursue policies
that are compliant. Together, these "three Ps" [are the main instruments
by which noncompliance is ameliorated and governance regimes are made
successful]{.underline}. 45

[[In]{.mark} the case of [free trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example,
[[the international community]{.underline}]{.mark} has [systematically
[dismantled trade barriers through]{.mark}]{.underline} a process of
[[negotiation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[pressure]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and dispute resolution]{.underline}]{.mark} conducted in successive
rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World
Trade Organization (WTO). 46 The problem of littoral state
territoriality and control has been largely resolved through the
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) construct developed and institutionalized
under the United Nations Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 47 As noted above,
numerous arms control agreements based on explicit bargains and robust
monitoring and verification have mitigated the risk of a nuclear arms
race. Stratospheric ozone depletion has been arrested through interstate
learning, regulation, and capacity assistance in the context of the
Montreal Protocol. 48

In the case of SAI, [the strategy required to achieve
cooperative]{.underline}, [multilateral implementation of climate
intervention technologies is persuasion]{.underline}. [Persuasion
consists of efforts to alter conceptions of interest so that actors are
motivated to behave in ways that support successful
outcomes]{.underline}. Learning may be central to the process of
redefining interests. The objects of persuasion may include not only
governments, but also private firms, which are often the ultimate
targets of international regulation, as well as large societal groups
whose beliefs and preferences can prove critical to regime performance.
Implicit in arguments about the efficacy of persuasion as a
problem-solving strategy is a conception of interests as constructed,
subjective, and amenable to change.

In order to move toward deployment, [[major powers]{.underline}]{.mark}
must [[regard geoengineering as serving their]{.mark} national
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of stratospheric aerosols,
leading states must come to view injections as a necessary complement to
carbon reductions. Without consensus on the need for intervention, there
is little value in pressing for more robust action. And, capacity does
not present any serious obstacles. Indeed, an abundance of capacity in
the form of available technologies such as aerosol injections represents
a key structural imperative supporting global collective action, as it
increases the likelihood of discordant deployments and mutual
interference.

Persuading governments to rethink their interests and recast their
policies is, of course, a daunting challenge. National interests may be
malleable, but they are typically entrenched and taken for granted. 49
Although knowledge of geoengineering remains limited, and international
opinion is inchoate, there exists unmistakable latent hostility to
climate engineering in most national governments. 50 Opposition may
become further entrenched as the variable distributional effects of
climate change become clearer. 51 For example, Russia may prefer the
improved agricultural productivity and greater accessibility linked to
global warming to previously less hospitable conditions across the bulk
of its landmass. 52

However, [[such positions may be more amenable to change]{.mark} than
commonly supposed]{.underline}. At [a]{.underline}n April 2009
[geoengineering workshop in Lisbon]{.underline} held under the auspices
of the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC), [[representatives
from the]{.underline}]{.mark} United States
([[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}), Canada, European Union
([[E.U]{.mark}.]{.underline}) member states,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
India]{.underline}]{.mark} [all [expressed]{.mark}]{.underline} some
degree of [[openness to]{.underline}]{.mark} the goals of [[climate
intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}. 53 Significantly, [the world's first
aerosol field trial was conducted in Russia]{.underline} in 2009, 54 led
by scientists with very close links to Russian government officials
including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.55 [China engaged in weather
modification while hosting the]{.underline} 2008 Summer
[Olympics]{.underline}.56 Russia, China, and Japan all raised concerns
about the wisdom of the recent CBD moratorium. 57

## AT: ADV\-\--Golden Dome

### AT: Indo-China War !\-\--1NC

**No India-China war**\-\--CBMs, audience costs, and larger priorities.

**Singh 20**, DPhil student in Area Studies (South Asia) at the
University of Oxford. (Ameya Pratap, 6-1-2020, \"Why Another Sino-Indian
War Is Unlikely\", *The Diplomat*,
https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/why-another-sino-indian-war-is-unlikely/)

However, [contrary to widespread fears, [a]{.mark}nother [Sino-Indian
war is unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} to be in the offing. [In the shadow
of nuclear weapons, a limited conventional war on the Sino-Indian
border]{.underline} --- somewhat akin to the month-long clash in 1962 --
[can be avoided for several reasons]{.underline}.

[First]{.underline}, this is because of [the nature of the
dispute]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [lack of ideological
fundamentalism]{.underline} and issue indivisibility. [Unlike the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [which has increasingly begun
to view the geopolitical competition with China as a battle for
values]{.underline} such as freedom of navigation or democracy or the
preservation of the liberal international order, [India and China do not
see each other through such an ideological lens. The authoritarian
regime of the Chinese Community Party is not perceived to be
antithetical to India's democratic character]{.underline}, and vice
versa. India's long-term strategy, as former Foreign Secretary Vijay
Gokhale puts it, is to retain its strategic autonomy, and pursue
alignments based "on issues, not ideology."

Hence, [while both parties have been cautious of each other's maneuvers
on the border, they have refrained from linking these to existential
attributes of national identity,]{.underline} [which are notorious for
inflating the significance of disputed territories]{.underline} --- for
example in the case of Kashmir, Tibet, or Taiwan. In fact, Beijing has
long held that the border dispute is a remnant of British colonialism
and its reckless cartographic practices, rather than being driven by
India's territorial expansionism. On the Indian side, Army Chief General
Manoj Mukund Naravane, in a break from traditional bouts of
recrimination between adversaries, accepted that due to differing
notions of the LAC, "both sides" were guilty of aggressive behavior in
Eastern Ladakh and North Sikkim. This choice of words effectively
yielded the use of any victimhood narratives that could be mobilized to
create moral justification for retaliatory action.

[Second]{.underline}, [[the risks of]{.mark} inadvertent [pre-emption
are]{.mark} also [not]{.mark} nearly as [high]{.mark}]{.underline} as
they were in 1962, [when]{.underline} [Nehru's]{.underline} ill-fated
"[forward policy]{.underline}" [was met by overwhelming Chinese military
force. This is because of a series of [five agreements]{.mark} signed
between India and China [to address disputes]{.mark} arising [over the
LAC]{.mark}]{.underline}: 1) [the 1993]{.underline} [Agreement on the
Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility]{.underline} along the LAC; 2) [the
1996 Agreement on C]{.underline}onfidence-[B]{.underline}uilding
[M]{.underline}easure[s]{.underline} in the Military Field Along the
LAC, 3) [the 2005 Protocol on Modalities for the Implementation of
C]{.underline}onfidence-[B]{.underline}uilding
[M]{.underline}easure[s]{.underline} in the Military Field Along the
LAC; 4) [the 2012 Agreement on the]{.underline} [Establishment of a
Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China
Border Affairs]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} 5) [the 2013 Border
Defense Cooperation Agreement]{.underline}.

[These agreements [provide a modus operandi for diplomatic
engagement]{.mark} at the military and political levels, [as well
as]{.mark} a set of "[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}" [commitments
both]{.mark} sides [can return to in case of
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They proved effective]{.mark} [during
the 16-day stand-off]{.mark} between Indian and Chinese forces
[in]{.mark} eastern [Ladakh]{.mark} near the village of Chumar, the
military confrontation [at Burtse]{.mark} in the Depsang plains in
northern Ladakh in 2015, [and]{.mark} [the Doklam crisis]{.mark} in
2017.]{.underline}

[Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava has
also affirmed New Delhi's intention to de-escalate the current stand-off
based on these agreements]{.underline}. He stated that "[[the
two]{.mark} sides \[[already]{.mark}\] [have]{.mark} established
[mechanisms to resolve]{.mark} such [situations peacefully]{.mark}
through dialogue]{.underline}." Similarly, the Chinese official
statement also reiterated Beijing's commitment "to uphold peace and
tranquility in border areas." Summit diplomacy is likely to return if
the crisis escalates further.

[Third is the element of ambiguity and the "fog" surrounding the details
of the military stand-off.]{.underline} Typically, [analysts have viewed
"nationalist strongmen" as promoters of aggressive state
behavior.]{.underline} But, in this case, [[the ability of both
governments to control national media]{.mark}, and the inscrutability of
the facts related to the dispute, aided efforts to manage domestic
audience costs]{.underline}. For instance, [media reports of 15-20
personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force being detained by the
Chinese were categorically refuted by the Indian side. This [meant that
no domestic pressure for retal]{.mark}iation [arose]{.mark} and no great
reputational damage was suffered]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
Doklam crisis, similar [[ambiguity allowed both sides to claim]{.mark}
tactical [victories]{.mark} for themselves]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
[diffuse the situation]{.mark} successfully]{.underline}. In India,
criticism has been incrementally rising with respect to the Modi
government's lack of transparency on the matter, but it is unlikely to
reach electorally harmful proportions.

Lastly, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} material [[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} limited [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} for both
parties [[far outweigh]{.mark} potential [gains]{.mark}. For China,
conflict on the border with India would diminish its ability to meet key
security challenges in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea, thus [making it vulnerable to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [which Beijing considers its primary security
competitor. [It seems unlikely]{.mark} that [Beijing would]{.mark} want
to [risk a two-front war]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Additionally]{.underline}, [[reputational damages]{.mark} suffered due
to]{.underline} [COVID]{.underline}-19, [pre-existing fears surrounding
China's rise, [and]{.mark} India's conventional and [nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} capabilities will all [temper Beijing]{.mark}'s
pre-emptive use of military force]{.underline}. Similarly, [[for India,
the primary]{.mark} security [challenge remains
Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}-based terrorist infiltration on the
Kashmir border. More importantly, beyond the protection of vital
strategic points on either side that allow military forces to
effectively defend and patrol their territories in challenging
high-altitude mountainous regions, [the vast tracts of [disputed
land]{.mark} along the LAC [do not hold any]{.mark} important material
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} [such as oil,]{.underline} precious
[mineral reserves, or ethnic-kin populations. The benefits of
territorial aggrandizement are therefore]{.underline},
[limited]{.underline} to deterrence value [and [the]{.mark} natural
[terrain offers few advantages to offensive forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep26667.24)

[The control for this situation is]{.underline} the policy of "no first
use" ([NFU]{.underline}) nuclear doctrine [adopted by China and
India]{.underline}, but not by Pakistan.60 Although the Indian defense
minister has made some noise about following a flexible nuclear
doctrine, [it is unlikely that India would launch a nuclear first strike
against China and the same would apply to China]{.underline}.61 [Nuclear
weapons are primarily intended to serve as a deterrent]{.underline}. [[A
nuclear attack by India]{.mark} on China [would invite an overwhelming
second-strike]{.mark} and produce unpredictable fallout]{.underline}.
Similarly [a first strike nuclear attack by China on India is equally
inconceivable, as [India has]{.mark} also developed [second-strike
capability]{.mark}]{.underline} through submarine launched ballistic
missiles (SLBMs), longrange ground launched ballistic missiles, and
potentially it could air deliver such weapons through bombers and
fighter jets.62

The idea of first-strike Indian nuclear launch against China or a
Chinese nuclear attack on India given the current political trajectory
and because of the NFU policy is not within the realm of possibility,
but a conventional war along the LAC is a high likelihood and there is
very strong historical precedence for it. More importantly [[China
believes]{.mark} that [its]{.mark} superior [conventional]{.mark}
military [power is sufficient]{.mark} to subdue India; hence [there
would be little need]{.mark} for China [to attack India with
nucl]{.mark}ear weapon[s]{.mark} or even issue any nuclear threats or
warnings to deter India. [China's size and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} [[military]{.underline}]{.mark}, economic, and
diplomatic capabilities [are sufficient to [deter]{.mark} [India
from]{.mark}]{.underline} engaging in any military
[[adventurism]{.underline}]{.mark}.63 With regard to intentions,
[Beijing does not believe that New Delhi intends to either initiate a
conventional or a nuclear war against China. This is because India's
position vis-à-vis China is preservative]{.underline}---[hold the
territory and continue negotiations---and [it is unlikely]{.mark} that
[India]{.mark} [would pursue unprovoked]{.mark} and unilateral [military
action against a superior adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}.64 [[India
is]{.mark} preparing a [defensive]{.mark} strategy]{.underline} by
building up its military capacity and infrastructure along the border to
prevent any encroachment by the People's Liberation Army.65

[[A]{.mark}nother [potential cost of]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence
is]{.mark} the [risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation [or
accident]{.mark}]{.underline}. The risk of accidental nuclear war was
the subject of numerous reflections and studies during the Cold war.
More recently, a school of thought [embodied by the works of Scott Sagan

to complex systems 61 and organizations such as those which manage
nuclear weapons.

Finally, as recalled above, one of the motivations for the \"abolition\"
of nuclear weapons is the risk of nuclear terrorism.

[It remains a fact, [however]{.mark}, that [no]{.mark} nuclear

publicly known, rather elaborate in most other nuclear-armed countries.
No system is infallible, and there may very well be one day a major
nuclear incident; but [the [probability]{.mark} that such an incident
would lead to the actual detonation of a nuclear weapon [seems]{.mark}
to be [vanishingly small]{.mark}]{.underline}. Likewise, the probability
of nuclear terrorism seems to be vastly exaggerated. 62

As far as [[deterrence]{.mark} itself]{.underline} is concerned, it
would be wrong to calculate its inherent risks as one does for complex
technological systems: it primarily [[rests on human reasoning]{.mark}
--- which itself is far from being infallible, [but]{.mark}]{.underline}
as Robert Jervis says, [[it does not take a lot]{.mark} of rationality
for deterrence [to work]{.mark}]{.underline}. 63

[[To claim]{.mark} that \"[we have been lucky]{.mark} so
far\"]{.underline}, as have many analysts and politicians --- from
Robert McNamara to the Gang of Four --- [[is]{.mark} either metaphorical
or [unverifiable. By contrast]{.mark}]{.underline}, as explained below,
[[statistical studies]{.mark} have [shown]{.mark} that the [possession
of nuclear weapons]{.mark} significantly [reduced]{.mark} the
[probability of war]{.mark} among two countries]{.underline}. Kenneth
Waltz does not exaggerate when he claims that \"[the [probability
of]{.mark} major [war]{.mark} among states having nuclear weapons
[approaches zero]{.mark}]{.underline}\".64

Nuclear pessimism has a long lineage of authors who have been proven
wrong. In 1960, C. P. Snow wrote that if a dozen new countries were to
build nuclear weapons, the risk of a nuclear explosion in the next
decade would be a "mathematical certainty."65 In 1973, Fred Iklé, one of
the most brilliant American minds of the Cold war, who could not see any
other explanation for non-use than mere luck, predicted that nuclear
deterrence would probably fail before the end of the 20th century. 66
[There is no reason to take seriously the allegedly scientific
previsions made over the past few years, such as that of Martin Hellman
(1% risk of failure per year)]{.underline} or that made --- with less
intellectual pomp --- by the Scientific American magazine (one chance
out of 30 for the current decade). 67

The risk of nuclear escalation --- The risk of escalation has to exist
if deterrence is to be operative. But [[if one sets aside]{.mark} the
[Cuban]{.mark} Missile [Crisis]{.mark} (1962)]{.underline} for the
Soviet Union and perhaps, to some extent, the Yom Kippur War (1973) for
Israel, [there does [not]{.mark} seem to be [any example when]{.mark}
nuclear [weapons have been]{.mark} really [\"close\" to being
employed]{.mark}: neither [in Korea]{.mark} (1950), nor at
[Dien-Bien-Phu]{.mark} (1954), nor in the [Formosa]{.mark} Straits
(1954-1955 and 1957-1958); neither during the second [Berlin]{.mark}
crisis (1961), nor during the battle of [Khe Sanh]{.mark} (1968), the
[Ussuri River]{.mark} crisis (1969), the US/[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea tensions (1969), [the \"madman\"]{.mark} nuclear
[alert]{.mark} (1969) 68 or the [South Asia]{.mark} war (1971). Likewise
for the [Able Archer]{.mark} incident (1983), the [Gulf War]{.mark}
(1991), [or]{.mark} the South [Asian crises of]{.mark} 19[90]{.mark}
19[99 and 2002]{.mark}]{.underline}. 69 To envision the possible use of
nuclear weapons, discuss it with one\'s advisers, seriously consider it
if the crisis was to worsen, possibly make it known publicly (and/or put
forces on a higher state of alert), have it planned by military staffs
is one thing. To have \"the finger on the button\" and be on the verge
of ordering a nuclear strike is quite another. We will never know if
nuclear weapons would have been used if one of these crises had further
escalated. But they showed that with very few exceptions, [the highest
political authorities --- of various types of regimes and personality
--- have been extraordinarily prudent regarding their
use]{.underline}.70 [Most [exercises and wargames showed]{.mark} that
[possessors]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [were]{.mark} extraordinarily
[reluctant to]{.mark} engage in massive nuclear
[strike]{.mark}s.\"]{.underline} George Quester, one of the most subtle
American analysts of deterrence theory, considers, for instance ---
after a rigorous analysis of the early days of the Cold war --- that
ethical motivations were paramount to explain the absence of any US
nuclear use when it was in a situation of monopoly. 72 Hence the idea of
a \"nuclear taboo\" proposed by Nina Tannenwald for the United States or
that of a \"tradition of non-use\" suggested by T. V. Paul for
nuclear-armed countries in general. 73 [It is not an exaggeration to
claim that the nuclear terror message conveyed by popular culture
(novels, movies, cartoons, documentaries, photographs\...) played a role
in the consolidation of this taboo.]{.underline} 74

The risk of inadvertent nuclear war --- As for [the risk of
\"inadvertent\" nuclear war]{.underline} (a deliberate nuclear strike
because of a false alarm), this [is hardly a credible scenario. Multiple
false alarms took place during the Cold war]{.underline}. But contrary
to what some journalists and novelists may believe, there is no reason
to think that a US or Russian president has ever been close to launching
nuclear weapons due to a mere alert. One example frequently cited ---
which ranks high in the mythology of nuclear disarmament activists ---
is that of the 1995 Norwegian sounding rocket launch; the Russian early
warning system, at that time in very poor condition, had signaled that
it might be a missile.75 President Yeltsin had been summoned, and the
Cheget (the nuclear \"briefcase\") had reportedly been presented to him.
It is possible and even likely that Russia has a \"launch-on-warning\"
posture. But can one seriously believe that Moscow would have launched a
nuclear attack (against whom?) just because an unknown object had been
launched from Norway, and even before it was ascertained whether the
object was going to reach Russian territory (which was not the case)? As
for the Cold war false alarms --- there were several in the United
States in the 1980s, including because of [[software glitches]{.mark}
--- they [never led a]{.mark} US [President to]{.mark} envision a
nuclear [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the United States, [[an
alert]{.mark} regarding a possible nuclear attack [has to be confirmed
by two different]{.mark} types of [sensors]{.mark} (dual phenomenology);
[a threat]{.mark} assessment [conference then]{.mark} would [decide
if]{.mark} political [authorities should be
contacted]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The risk of accidental or unauthorized use --- Likewise, the risk of an
\"accidental\" (non-deliberate) or \"unauthorized\" strike is
considerably exaggerated by disarmament activists. In most if not all
countries, to be launched, [nuclear forces have to receive a series of
complex instructions with multiple verifications]{.underline}. As
recalled by the commander of USSTRATCOM, General Chilton, [US missiles
are not on a \"hair-trigger alert\" posture: they are \"in the
holster]{.underline}. The nuclear forces of the five NPT- recognized
Nuclear-Weapon States have been detargeted, and Asian nuclear warheads
are reportedly separated from their launchers. [Such procedures have
been devised partly so that catastrophist fiction scenarios]{.underline}
--- which were, it should be said, much more credible until at least the
1960s --- [could not materialize]{.underline}. Serious incidents
regarding the custody of nuclear forces have been reported, but none
that ever posed the gravest risk. An American author has interestingly
suggested that since 1945, [[the]{.mark} tens of [thousands]{.mark} of
persons [that have had]{.mark} the [charge]{.mark}, at one level or
another, [of nuclear weapons]{.mark} \"must [have taken]{.mark} much
[greater care than]{.mark} is taken [in any other situation involving
human agents and complex mechanical systems]{.mark}."]{.underline}77

### AT: Foreign Nuclear Failures !\-\--2NC

**[States are rational]{.underline}, especially when the stakes are
high.**

**Mearsheimer 23**, \*PhD, Distinguished Service Professor in the
Political Science Department at the University of Chicago. \*\*PhD,
Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame. (\*John
and \*\*Sebastian Rosato, *How States Think: The Rationality of Foreign
Policy*, Yale University Press, p. 11-12)

Assessing Strategic Rationality in World Politics

Once rationality has been defined, we can assess whether states are
rational actors. In essence, there are two positions on the matter. [We
argue that [states are routinely rational]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
political psychologists claim they are routinely nonrational. Analyses
of [both sets of arguments, as well as the historical record,
reveal]{.underline} that [rationality is commonplace]{.underline} in
international politics.

Routine Rationality

Given our definition of rationality as credible theories plus
deliberation, we find that generally speaking, [states are rational
actors]{.underline}. [Individual policymakers]{.underline} typically
[employ credible theories to inform their understanding of international
politics and decisions]{.underline} about the issues at hand [and
deliberate among themselves to formulate strategies]{.underline} for
reaching their goals.

Our analysis of the historical record focuses on a series of prominent
cases in which great powers formulated grand strategies and managed
crises. We examine instances in which those states are said to have
thought and acted in a nonrational fashion. The reason is simple: if the
great powers were rational in these cases of alleged nonrationality,
then they are likely to have been rational at most other times as well.
We have not, of course, analyzed the entire historical record. That is
impossible as there are innumerable cases of states making foreign
policy decisions and scant evidence on many of them. Nevertheless, we
believe our approach goes some way toward addressing the problem.

It is important to note that [in many of the cases we examine, the
chosen policy failed]{.underline}, sometimes disastrously. [This does
not mean that the state in question was nonrational]{.underline}.
[[There is a]{.mark} crucial conceptual [distinction between process and
outcomes]{.mark}, and [rationality is about the former]{.mark}, not the
latter]{.underline}. [Rational states seek to make sense of the world
and systematically consider the strategies available to them. [It does
not follow]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the policies [they]{.mark} choose [will
be successful]{.mark}]{.underline}. States can be committed to
theory-driven deliberation yet fail to reach their desired outcome
because of some exogenous constraint or unforeseen circumstance. By the
same token, there are several reasons---such as chance or overwhelming
superiority---why nonrational states may achieve their objectives. To
sum up, states can be rational and unsuccessful as well as nonrational
and successful. It therefore makes little sense to equate rationality
with outcomes. Nevertheless, a state that pursues a rational strategy is
more likely to succeed than fail since it has a good understanding of
international politics and has carefully pondered how to proceed.

None of this is to say that rationality is ubiquitous in international
politics. Indeed, we identify a number of instances of nonrationality,
where states either failed to deliberate, failed to base their policy on
a credible theory, or both.

[[There is a simple explanation]{.mark} for why states routinely think
and act rationally when making foreign policy]{.underline}.
[[International politics is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} business. [[States]{.mark}
[operate]{.mark} in a system [where there is no higher authority to
protect them]{.mark}]{.underline} and where other states can and may
want to do them grave harm. Consequently, [[they have a strong interest
in finding the best strategies to address]{.mark} the [problems]{.mark}
they confront]{.underline}. [[This leads]{.mark} individual
[policymakers to employ credible theories]{.mark} to make sense of the
world and decide what to do]{.underline}, [[as well as]{.mark} to
[deliberate among themselves to settle on a strategy]{.mark} for moving
forward]{.underline}. This is not to deny that [[states will sometimes
think]{.underline}]{.mark} and act [[nonrationally]{.underline}]{.mark}
when devising grand strategies or navigating crises.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[high costs of failure mean]{.mark} that
[such cases are]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to be
[[uncommon]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Lasers !\-\--1NC

#### Laser defense fails and makes conflict [more]{.underline}, not less, [likely]{.underline}. 

**Fedasiuk and Reif 18**, \*China Technology Policy Advisor at the U.S.
Department of State, M.A., Security Studies, Georgetown University,
\*\*Director for Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy, Arms Control
Association (\*Ryan Fedasiuk, \*\*Kingston Reif, May 14, 2018, "Reasons
to Doubt Laser Missile Defense," Arms Control Association,
https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2018-05-14/reasons-doubt-laser-missile-defense)

However, if the technology proves successful, the agency will run into
problems with beam quality. [As [a laser]{.mark} travels]{.underline} to
its target, "[it [encounters atmospheric effects that [distort the
beam](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R41526.pdf)]{.mark} and cause it
to lose its focus]{.underline}." Particles in the atmosphere such as
[[water]{.mark} vapor, sand, [dust]{.mark}, salt, [and pollution]{.mark}
can [all absorb]{.mark} or refract a laser's
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [thermal
blooming](http://spie.org/Publications/Book/452443?SSO=1) is [of
particular concern in high-power laser weapons]{.underline}.

Tactical Considerations: Even if every technological barrier was
successfully conquered, though, [it's [far from clear]{.mark} that
[laser weapons would be]{.mark} an [effective]{.mark} form of [missile
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because lasers, unlike kinetic
interceptors, face limitations that are tactically insurmountable no
matter how advanced technology becomes:

• First, [a laser can only stop a missile if it generates enough
energy]{.underline} to cut into its electronics package. By adding [a
[harder, thicker]{.mark} layer of outside [shielding]{.mark},
adversaries [can strengthen]{.mark} a [missile's
"skin"]{.mark}]{.underline} and [prevent
it](https://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/the-limits-of-lasers-missile-defense-at-speed-of-light/) from
being disabled.

• Second, [lasers [can only]{.mark} focus [on one]{.mark} target [at a
time]{.mark}. An [adversary could]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[launch a
salvo]{.mark} attack [to oversaturate]{.mark} laser
defenses]{.underline}.

• Third, laser weapons [can only destroy targets in [their line of
sight]{.mark}]{.underline}. This means most systems would be [[unable to
target low-flying]{.mark} cruise [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, line-of-sight systems are restricted by [the [curvature of the
earth]{.mark} and risk [let]{.mark}ting [targets get away [over the
horizon](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44175.pdf)]{.mark}]{.underline}---a
limitation not faced by heat-seeking kinetic interceptors.

There are also platform-specific limitations unique to lasers:

• Air-, ground-, and sea-based platforms [need to be
close](https://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/missile-defense/basics/general_principles.htm) to
the target's launch site to achieve boost-phase missile interception.
But perpetually keeping laser weapons near prospective launch sites is
financially unsustainable, and if the platform is manned, it is risky
for military personnel.

• Space-based platforms [[may]{.mark} accidentally [[damage]{.mark} or
destroy](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nwgs/slr_in_china.pdf) nearby
[satellites, risking escalation in a conflict]{.mark} or inhibiting U.S.
reconnaissance operations]{.underline}.

Despite [the many pitfalls of directed energy weapons]{.underline}, it
is unlikely that the Missile Defense Agency will soon relinquish the
chase for laser defense. But one thing is certain: the road ahead will
be difficult and costly.

### AT: Lasers !\-\--2NC

#### Boost-phase fails and is escalatory. 

**Hollings 23**, Military Reporter, the National Interest, former United
States Marine, citing DoD power figures and laser reports (Alex
Hollings, October 5, 2023, "Lasers Could Be Helpless Against Hypersonic
Weapons," National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/lasers-could-be-helpless-against-hypersonic-weapons-206878)

In order to stop a hypersonic missile from reaching its target, [the
[DoD]{.mark} estimates that they'd [need at least]{.mark} a 1 megawatt
(or [1,000 kilo]{.mark}watt) [laser]{.mark}. That's [more than three
times]{.mark} the power output of [today's most advanced]{.mark}
tactical laser [system]{.mark}... but [even such]{.mark} a laser
[would]{.mark} likely [struggle to burn]{.mark} through [the nosecone of
a]{.mark} hypersonic [missile]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [these
[weapons are designed to withstand]{.mark} temperatures in excess of
[1,700 degrees]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

And as the Navy has pointed out, [[it's cheap]{.mark}er [to
build]{.mark} missiles with more [heat shielding]{.mark}]{.underline}
than it is to field lasers with more power output -- so as laser
defenses become more commonplace, missiles will almost certainly be
better shielded and thus, less susceptible to laser engagement. 

[Line of Sight]{.underline}

Unlike interceptors, which can be launched at targets identified beyond
the horizon, the very nature of [[lasers limit]{.mark}s them to [line of
sight]{.mark}. This presents problems when the laser needs time to burn
through a target]{.underline}. Hypersonic weapons like [[China's DF-ZF
may be]{.mark} traveling at [2 miles per second]{.mark} or even faster,
meaning [there would be]{.mark} precious [little time to]{.mark}
actually [destroy]{.mark} the weapon]{.underline} by the time it
appeared in the lasers' line of sight. 

[Atmospheric Scattering]{.underline}

We tend to think of lasers as a thin beam of energy that continues
onward forever, but that's really not the case at all. [[Water]{.mark}
vapor, [sand]{.mark}, salt, [smoke]{.mark}, air [pollution]{.mark}, and
other substances found [in the atmosphere]{.mark} can [all]{.mark} have
a [scatter]{.mark}ing effect on [laser beams]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
atmospheric [turbulence is a serious problem]{.underline} -- to the
point where [the [Pentagon]{.mark} currently [sees lasers as]{.mark} a
[viable]{.mark} weapon system [only]{.mark} at ranges of [less than a
mile]{.mark}. And even optimistic [projections for the]{.mark} near
[future still only]{.mark} think lasers will be [viable at]{.mark}
ranges of less than [five miles]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

"HOTLINE" WITH CHINA ISN'T THE ANSWER," Pacific Forum,
https://pacforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PacNet41.2022.07.27-1.pdf)

However, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and PRC hold different
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} and goals [[about
hotlines]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The United States views them as a tool to deconflict and de-escalate and
communicate between forces during a crisis. [The [PLA harbors]{.mark}
deep [suspicion about]{.mark} crisis [communications with]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, and [perceives US proposals]{.mark} for
new channels [as]{.mark} an [excuse to engage in provocative]{.mark}
military [activities]{.mark} near PRC claimed waters and
territory.]{.underline}

Beijing regards crisis communications as subservient to broader
political goals of "crisis management," which encompass exploiting
crises to its advantage and manipulating risk calculations. Hotlines are
not meant to resolve the crisis but to empower higher level organs
within the PRC to signal resolve, assign blame, and stall until Beijing
stakes out a position of maximum pressure and leverage over the United
States during negotiations.

This incompatibility has not stopped senior US defense officials from
holding out hope that hotlines and personal relationships with PLA
leaders might ease tensions. In his recent book, for instance, former US
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper says he could rapidly contact his
"counterpart," Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe, to clear
up misunderstandings.

Such [[hopes could be misplaced]{.mark}. Not only could hotlines fail to
solve crises, but they might also not perform as intended]{.underline}.
As Kurt Campbell, the Biden administration's National Security council
Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, has said: [[hotlines]{.mark} tend to
"[ring endlessly in empty rooms]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### AT: I/L\-\--Hotlines\-\--2NC

#### China won't do hotlines.

**Mainprize 23**, Ph.D. Candidate, U.S. Foreign Policy, University of

No Cold War Relic," National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/hotline-diplomacy-no-cold-war-relic-206813)

Hotlines exist between the United States and China at the executive and
military levels. Grounded in their experiences in the twentieth century,
various U.S. administrations have long viewed hotlines as a vital
diplomatic asset and have been motivated to use them
during [contemporary
crises](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russia-have-used-deconfliction-line-once-so-far-during-ukraine-war-source-2022-11-28/),
either with China or other strategic competitors. Although [the
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty leadership
[has]{.mark} so far [shown]{.mark} an [aversion to managing
escalation]{.mark} bilaterally with the United States,
frequently [leaving calls unanswered]{.mark} over the past few decades.
[Beijing ignored]{.mark} American [attempts]{.mark} to communicate
[during]{.mark} the [Tiananmen]{.mark} Square massacre in 1989. [Twelve
calls]{.mark} were made [by]{.mark} the [Bush]{.mark} administration
[during]{.mark} the [Hainan]{.mark} Island incident in 2001, with
[each]{.mark} of them similarly [being snubbed]{.mark}. The [same would
happen]{.mark} again [during]{.mark} numerous other episodes, and
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping and other Chinese policymakers [have
rebuffed]{.mark} [modest
[proposals]{.mark}](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4056697-xi-rejects-us-offer-to-set-up-military-crisis-hotline-blinken-says/)[ for]{.mark}
more active [hotline]{.mark} discussions.]{.underline}

Analysts have noted that [[Chinese]{.mark} officials [hold
suspicions]{.mark} over [why America]{.mark}n leaders [would
want]{.mark} to utilize [hotlines, viewing them as]{.mark} little other
than an [instrument]{.mark} for the United States [to]{.mark}
surreptitiously [normalize]{.mark} certain Indo-[Pacific]{.mark} region
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. More dangerously, they also believe
they can find strategic advantage in avoiding hotline conversations
and [the ambiguity this helps
create](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Xm42G1VXat5PXNfIlDxox?si=26425479a4854eee).
But regardless of the differences of opinion, the Cold War shows
bilateral crisis management is still essential.

As [anxiety continues to mount over the fate of Taiwan and the South
China Sea]{.underline}, the United States must continue to pressure the
Communist Party leadership to come to the phone more promptly.
Complaining after the fact isn't enough. It should now be a significant
part of U.S. foreign policy to construct a more effective hotline
dialogue with Beijing. American officials must explain that the
ambiguity the Chinese leaders seek during a crisis is dangerous.

[With the rise of artificial intelligence and the [ubiquity of
disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/china-spends-billions-on-pro-russia-disinformation-us-special-envoy-says),
serious miscalculations over specific naval movements or espionage
incidents have become more likely]{.underline}. A lack of communication
could result in a dangerous slide toward military or nuclear
confrontation. In a geopolitical climate where [atomic
threats](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/06/putin-nuclear-war-ukraine-russia-biden-west-armageddon-psychology-influence-operations-disinformation-manipulation/) have
again begun to be bandied around, Beijing and Washington will find that
talking is the best medicine.

[[and leave]{.mark} their [U.S. counterparts in the dark]{.mark}.
Beijing [thinks]{.mark} that such [dialogue serves as]{.mark} a
guardrail or a [safety net]{.mark} that [allows]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to keep conducting military
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} in the western Pacific without fear of
repercussions. [In China's view]{.underline}, then, an open line of
[communication]{.underline} on military matters [actively abets
Washington's behavior]{.underline}, allowing the United States a greater
freedom of action. [[Preventing dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}, by
contrast, [might [keep]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [on
its toes]{.mark}]{.underline}, depriving U.S. officials of knowledge
about what China's redlines are---and therefore making them more
cautious.

BEIJING---[[China is resisting]{.mark} a U.S. push to build]{.underline}
more-reliable [systems for [communicating in a crisis, raising]{.mark}
the [risk]{.mark} that [a miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline} by either
side's military [[could spill into conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Rarely since the Cold War have tensions between [two global
powers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-plunge-further-into-a-spiral-of-hostilities-b9e539c0?mod=article_inline) risen
to the levels that exist between the U.S. and China today. But unlike
the Soviets, who embraced crisis hotlines with Washington as a way to
defuse tensions, Beijing is resisting the establishment of new
communication channels. [[As Chinese]{.mark} officials [see it, hotlines
give]{.mark} the [U.S. cover to continue]{.mark} what they view as
provocative [military operations]{.mark} in China's
backyard.]{.underline}

The democratically self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims
as part of China, sits at the nexus of the challenge. Concern that a
heavy military presence around Taiwan could cause a mishap is a major
reason why Washington wants better communication lines with Beijing.
Chinese leaders see the U.S.'s increasing support for Taiwan as
undermining the foundations of trust needed to establish credible
communication between the two powers.

The seriousness of the situation has grown as American and Chinese
military jets and naval craft operate in proximity in [contested skies
and
waters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-jet-fighters-step-up-pressure-on-u-s-aircraft-over-south-china-sea-c2d1ac88?mod=article_inline).
The two militaries regularly brush up against each other as China seeks
to ward off the U.S. from operating in the South China Sea, most of
which China claims.

China's use of military drills to exert pressure on Taiwan raises the
risks of an accident. When China launched [military
exercises](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-military-greets-return-of-taiwans-president-with-live-fire-drills-e6737c7c?mod=article_inline) around
Taiwan in April in response to a meeting between House Speaker Kevin
McCarthy (R., Calif.) and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in California,
a U.S. aircraft carrier was operating only a few hundred miles away.

"There is a significant reason for concern if the United States and
China stumble into a crisis over Taiwan," said Michael Swaine, a senior
research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. "I'm
not convinced that all sides involved, including the Taiwanese, have
what it takes to ensure that the crisis would be resolved successfully."

The Biden administration says that it isn't seeking the sort of
confrontation with China that the U.S. had with the Soviet Union. For
one thing, the U.S. and China are far more interconnected economically
than the U.S. and Soviet Union were, despite the recent hostility and
efforts by both countries to make their economies less interdependent. 

[Business executives with

stable U.S.-China ties have helped previously to smooth tensions between
the countries. With business connections severed by the pandemic slowly
being re-established, prospects for improved communication are rising.

Even so, senior U.S. officials are talking openly about taking a page
from the previous era and establishing hotlines. 

"We built those during the Cold War, and we think they are appropriate
now," said Kurt Campbell, the White House's coordinator for the
Indo-Pacific, at a think-tank event in March.

So far these efforts, which U.S. officials describe as [putting
guardrails around the relationship, haven't worked]{.underline}, Mr.
Campbell said.

[[China and]{.mark} the [U.S. already have]{.mark} some
[hotlines]{.mark}]{.underline} that connect their leaders, including a
military link established in 2008. A key problem is that [[China]{.mark}
sometimes [refuses to use]{.mark} this hotline [in]{.mark} moments of
[crisis, rendering it]{.mark} an [unreliable]{.mark} tool to manage
tensions]{.underline}. In addition, unlike with red phones in Hollywood
movies, [[meetings]{.mark} through the military hotline [can take
days]{.mark} or more [to set up]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

[[China declined to speak]{.mark} with U.S.]{.underline} Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin in February [[after]{.mark} the [U.S.
shot]{.mark} down [a]{.mark}]{.underline} suspected [[Chinese]{.mark}
surveillance [balloon]{.mark}]{.underline} that had drifted across the
continental U.S. At the time, [[China said]{.mark} the [U.S. hadn't
created]{.mark} the right [conditions for dialogue. Calls for]{.mark}
better [communication ring hollow if Washington violates Beijing's most
sensitive areas of concern]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the "One China"
policy on Taiwan, said Xu Bu, a former senior Chinese diplomat who is
now president of the Foreign Ministry-affiliated China Institute of
International Studies.

New START's Suspension Does Not Really Matter, No. 557,\" Nation

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [ought not
mourn]{.underline} Russia's suspension of the New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty ([New START]{.underline}). [Claims]{.underline} that
[the treaty was]{.underline} "a key [stabilizing]{.underline} force in
U.S.-Russian [relations]{.underline} for more than a decade" [are
mistaken]{.underline}.\[1\] New START's demise will not make U.S.-Russia
relations any worse than they already are, thanks to Russia's aggressive
actions, including its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February
2022.\[2\] That is because arms races, and by extension arms control,
are a reflection of politics, as the eminent strategist Colin Gray
famously postulated.\[3\] His fundamental point is that [[because arms
control]{.mark} [reflects]{.mark} overarching political
[relations]{.mark}, arms [agreements]{.mark} with foes [are unlikely to
accomplish much]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and agreements with friends
are]{.underline} likely to be [superfluous]{.underline}. It is also why
Russia's New START suspension does not fundamentally alter the
relationship between the two countries; nor does it make the United
States and allies any less secure than when the treaty was intact.

[[Arms control has a history of failing]{.underline}]{.mark} to live up
to the arms controllers' high expectations. For example,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} 1972
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}nti-[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}allistic
[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}issile Treaty [[led the Soviet Union]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} spend [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}d
resources on [[offensive nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear
weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, contrary to what proponents of the
treaty argued would happen at the time.\[4\] Reaching an agreement can
hardly be considered a success when the agreement does not advance U.S.
national security interests or puts an adversary in a better position to
compete. [Even arms control that succeeds initially can fail when one
side unilaterally chooses to cheat]{.underline}. As Colin Gray observed
during the Cold War, "The political antagonism that generates the
objective need for alleviation via arms control---always assuming, again
fallaciously, that arms control could control---is the very reason why
arms control must fail...."\[5\] [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} 1987
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}ntermediate-Range [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}uclear
[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}orces Treaty [[coincided with
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n unprecedented [[thaw]{.underline}]{.mark} in
bilateral relations and successfully eliminated an entire class of
ground-launched nuclear missiles---[[until Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
blatantly [[cheated]{.underline}]{.mark} on it, leading the Trump
Administration to withdraw from the treaty in 2019. The first Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks ([[SALT I]{.underline}]{.mark}) in 1972
[[failed]{.mark} to result in meaningful nuclear
reductions]{.underline}, and the follow-on SALT II in 1979 did not enter
into force due to worsening relations between the two countries. New
START is no different.

Today, [Russia has shown that it does not care about improving relations
with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and U.S. allies.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} regularly [[abuses]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} process [[to
advance]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[revisionist
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}, impedes the United States, and avoids
meaningful transparency and predictability. In other words, [[as long as
Russia maintains]{.mark} the]{.underline} aggressive,
[[revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark} political [goals it]{.underline}
currently [has]{.underline} ([[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} as well),
[the [lack of]{.mark} meaningful [arms control should be no
surprise]{.mark}]{.underline}---unless the United States was willing to
sign an agreement that serves Russian purposes, and not its own.

[Arms control]{.underline} by itself [cannot change the]{.underline}
political [dynamic among countries; [it can]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[place the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[at a]{.underline}]{.mark} political and
military [[disadvantage]{.underline}]{.mark} if conducted foolishly by
Washington. By the nature of its political system, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cannot
ignore]{.mark} arms control [treaties like Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
can and now [does]{.underline}, [leading Washington to bear the
political costs of withdrawing]{.underline} from treaties [after years
of Russia's violations]{.underline}. New START's focus on a relatively
narrow category of systems obscures the U.S. disadvantage in nuclear
production capabilities and very long lead times for nuclear weapon
system modernization in the post-Cold War era. In addition, [New START
leaves out systems that Russia would not agree to include within its
limits.]{.underline} By accepting those terms, the United States
essentially disadvantaged itself. The folly of lamentations over New
START is reflected in the endless Western claims that it limited the
total number of strategic nuclear forces to the agreed levels. It most
certainly did not; it limited only those systems that it counted---an
omission pointed to by critics at the time of its signing and since
fully exploited by Moscow.\[6\]

Setting the above aside momentarily, it must be acknowledged that [[the
future of arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near term [[is
bleak]{.underline}]{.mark}:

▪ [[It is difficult to conceive]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[how the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can]{.mark}
[return]{.mark} to an arms control]{.underline} negotiation [with Russia
[as]{.mark} long as]{.underline} Vladimir [[Putin
remains]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[president]{.underline}]{.mark}.

▪ [[The Chinese government]{.mark} has long been dismissive of entering
arms talks]{.underline} ([and [views transparency and inspection]{.mark}
regimes---both [fundamental to]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[success]{.mark}ful arms control]{.underline} accord---[[as
weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}).

▪ And [disarm]{.underline}ament [is unrealistic]{.underline} and not in
the cards. In this regard, it is instructive and curious that of the P5
countries, only the United States, the United Kingdom, and to some
degree France are sensitive to the domestic and international criticism
that they have not fulfilled their Article VI commitment of the Treaty
on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) (itself an
ambiguous commitment based on the negotiating record and the U.S.
government's interpretation of it). Russia and China both appear
impervious to such commentary, and international critics largely ignore
Moscow and Beijing's nuclear buildups.

[[Even before]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia destabilized Europe by
invading [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the idea of arms control was
under significant stress, as major [actors showed an inclination
to]{.mark} [violate]{.mark} basic [norms]{.mark}:]{.underline}

▪ [Under Putin, [Russia]{.mark} has [violated nine
treaties]{.mark}]{.underline} and agreements which his predecessors had
signed with the United States.122 In addition, [Russian]{.underline} air
and naval [assets, as an element of state policy, routinely violate
the]{.underline} 1972 [Incidents at Sea Agreement]{.underline} and the
1989 Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities.

▪ [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} air and naval [[forces, as a matter
of]{.mark} state [policy]{.mark}, routinely [violate the Code for
Unplanned Encounters]{.mark} at Sea]{.underline}.

Furthermore, difficulties have arisen when sensitive sources have
uncovered cheating, but [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cannot expose the
offender]{.underline}]{.mark} or inform allies or the public [[due to
concerns about]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[sources]{.underline}]{.mark} and
methods." Russia's violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty is the poster child in this regard.

U.S. DOMESTIC POLITICS

[[An inhospitable]{.mark} domestic-[political
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} within the United States
[[compounds]{.mark} the]{.underline} international [[hurdles to arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}. All of the U.S.- Russian arms control
treaties that entered into force during the Cold War received bipartisan
approval with eighty-eight or more affirmative votes. By contrast, the
most recent bilateral arms control agreement--- New START, ratified in
2011---passed seventy-one to twenty-six, with only 32 percent of
Republican senators supporting the treaty.50 This outcome seems to
reflect several trends and dynamics in U.S. politics that portend
greater difficulty for future arms control treaties.

[The first trend is sharpening]{.underline} partisan
[polarization]{.underline} in the United States---not only among the
mass public, but also evident [among policy elites]{.underline}---as
Democrats and Republicans have sorted into two opposing political
camps.51 Partisan [polarization hampers U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}
in many respects, [including by presenting barriers to]{.underline}
treaty [ratification]{.underline}, which requires a two-thirds vote by
the U.S. Senate. Over the last two decades[, [the number of]{.mark} new
international [agreements]{.mark} [concluded by the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has
plummeted]{.underline}]{.mark}. Treaty ratification has experienced an
especially sharp downward turn.52 Although not solely attributable to
partisan polarization, this trend does reflect fundamental divergence on
the nature of U.S. interests and the best methods to achieve national
security objectives, especially as concerns about the encroachments of
international law on U.S. sovereignty have become a particular stalking
horse of some on the ideological right.53 [Diminished congressional
interest in arms control issues makes reflexive partisanship even
likelier]{.underline}, [as members decline to consider the merits of an
agreement substantively and instead vote along party lines or weaponize
arms control]{.underline} politically.54

Polarization could also be eroding the consensus that undergirded the
last remaining arms control agreement between the United States and
Russia. [New START rested upon a bipartisan compromise]{.underline}
initially articulated by the Perry-Schlesinger Commission on the
Strategic Posture of the United States, which stated: "The United States
should continue to pursue an approach to reducing nuclear dangers that
balances deterrence, arms control, and nonproliferation. Singular
emphasis on one or the other element would reduce the nuclear security
of the United States."55 In effect, [hawkish Republicans accepted arms
control as the prerequisite for]{.underline} nuclear
[modernization]{.underline} and more dovish [Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s
accepted modernization as the price for arms control]{.underline}.56
Democratic Senator Robert Menendez put it plainly in 2018: "bipartisan
support for nuclear modernization is tied to maintaining an arms control
process that controls and seeks to reduce Russian nuclear forces."57 [As
partisan animosity has increased and bipartisan compromises have become
more difficult]{.underline}, [Dem]{.underline}ocrat[s]{.underline}
[could rethink their support for]{.underline} robust nuclear
[modernization]{.underline}, further [jeopardizing]{.underline} future
prospects for [arms control]{.underline}.

[This fragile accommodation could also founder as arms control
agreements reach into new territory. [Limit]{.mark}ation[s]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} U.S. [missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline}
[are]{.underline}, for example, [[a]{.mark} [central priority]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[China and]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}, but
agreeing to any such constraints [would be a political lightning
rod]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [perhaps even a third rail]{.underline}.
Recent political science research indicates that, as a Democrat, Biden
would face an especially high "ratification premium"; [gaining Senate
approval for a post--New START arms control treaty could entail a
political price]{.underline} in the form of defense spending [that
progressives are simply unwilling to pay]{.underline}.58 [[Hawks
could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[construe arms control
as]{.underline}]{.mark} overly "[[soft]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[on China
or Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}---a line of political attack that
partisan polarization all but guarantees. Anticipating such gridlock and
taxation of political capital, Biden or his successors could simply turn
away from treaty-based arms control and pursue executive agreements or
other, less formal measures.

Finally, [partisan [polarization undermines]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates[']{.underline}
[[cred]{.underline}]{.mark}ibility [as a counterparty in international
diplomacy, including arms control]{.underline} negotiations. [Arms
control [treaties are easy]{.mark} for presidents]{.underline} [[to
exit]{.underline}]{.mark} and therefore they are only as binding as a
president's willingness to uphold bargains struck by his predecessors.
[Polarization]{.underline} thus [injects]{.underline} greater
[volatility into U.S. foreign policy because of the likelihood of swings
and reversals]{.underline} whenever the presidency changes hands from a
Democrat to a Republican. [Allies and adversaries alike will observe
this inconstancy when considering diplomatic agreements, especially
costly ones]{.underline} that rest upon U.S. promises of future
restraint.59 Indeed, the congressional politics of the Iran nuclear deal
encapsulate the difficulties of nuclear diplomacy in a polarized
Washington, as the Barack Obama administration sought to circumvent
congressional gridlock by pursuing an executive agreement rather than a
treaty, and Congress' subsequent, highly contentious review of the deal
validated the wisdom of that strategy. [Once [Trump]{.mark} took
office]{.underline}, however, [he pulled the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [out]{.underline} of the deal and
[[reinstated]{.mark} sweeping [sanctions on Iran]{.mark}---[underscoring
the ease with which]{.mark} [presidents can withdraw from informal
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Work," The Space Review, https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4336/1)

Despite these challenges, some argue that ASAT arms control agreements
are a necessary aspect of a safe, secure, and stable space environment.
Advocates for arms control maintain agreements could prevent an ASAT
arms race. This is wrong. [[Arms control]{.mark} agreements
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} do more to [[shape]{.mark} the [direction of,
rather than prevent, an]{.mark}]{.underline} ASAT [[arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}. Because [[any agreement will be less]{.mark}
than [comprehensive, states will]{.mark} seek to [develop]{.mark} ASAT
[weapons that fall outside]{.mark} of the]{.underline} agreement's
[[jurisdiction]{.mark}. If the agreement bans kinetic ASAT
weapons]{.underline}, for instance, [space-capable nations will push to
develop more diverse, more effective non-kinetic weapons]{.underline}.

In addition, [any [agreement]{.mark} will]{.underline} likely
[[increase]{.mark} the [incentives to camouflage]{.mark} and disguise
[ASAT technology, worsening]{.mark} a [problem]{.mark} that the arms
control agreement initially set out to resolve]{.underline}. Any
[[restrictions]{.mark} will [inevitably force nations to]{.mark}
make]{.underline} ASAT [capabilities increasingly
[integrate]{.mark}]{.underline}d [with innocent
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} to avoid detection,
[[furthering]{.mark} the [dual-use]{.mark} problem]{.underline}, seeding
doubt among the reliability of routine space assets, [[and
incentivizing]{.mark} the [weaponization]{.mark} of outer
space]{.underline}.

Even worse, [[pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark} ASAT [arms control
agreements]{.underline} could be [[detrimental to]{.mark} the
[competitiveness]{.mark} of American assets in space. One]{.underline}
probable [[response]{.mark} to]{.underline} an ASAT [arms control
agreement [is reduced f]{.mark}ederal [g]{.mark}overnment's [willingness
to fund improvements to]{.mark} the [resiliency and
survivability]{.mark} of American space
constellations]{.underline}.\[16\] Maintaining American competitiveness
in space necessarily entails bolstering defensive measures against
hostile ASAT capabilities. But reducing, or appearing to reduce, the
threat to United States space assets through [arms control
agreements]{.underline} could [make it harder to convince legislators
and policymakers that]{.underline} expensive [satellite acquisitions are
worth pursuing]{.underline}.

From any perspective, [ASAT arms control is a waste of time and
detrimental to American interests]{.underline}.

counterforcing]{.underline}\-\--nuclear war.**

Conclusion

[In the past]{.underline}, nuclear [arms control could]{.underline}
arguably [pursue both strategic stability]{.underline} (by preserving
the survivability of retaliatory forces and thus reducing the incentives
for pre-emptive disarming strikes) [and smaller arsenals]{.underline}
(by cutting the numbers of weapons). [Such an approach is increasingly
dubious]{.underline} as a means of deterring nuclear conflict
[today]{.underline}. [A new era of tech]{.underline}nology
[means]{.underline} that [further [nuclear cuts
would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[undermine
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [leading to a world without the
stalemating benefits of nuclear possession yet with all the]{.underline}
traditional [dangers]{.underline} and more.

For decades, [[engineers]{.mark} have toiled to [improve weapons
accuracy and remote sensing]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, arms negotiators have devised agreements to reduce nuclear
arsenals. Either endeavor -- improving weapons or cutting stockpiles --
can be defended as a policy for promoting strategic stability, but taken
together they are creating underappreciated vulnerabilities. Good
intentions aside, [[nuclear]{.mark} arms [cuts]{.mark} today effectively
[reduce the number of targets]{.mark} that [an attacker must destroy in
a disarming strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The danger of nuclear
reductions is [exacerbated by]{.mark} improvements in the nonnuclear
means of attacking nuclear forces]{.underline}, for example,
[through]{.underline} [precision [conventional
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[anti-sub]{.underline}]{.mark}marine [war]{.underline}fare, [[and
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} operations.

Arms controllers may respond that one merely needs to restrict the
development of advanced counterforce systems, and then arms cuts will be
safe again. However, [the [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological
[[developments]{.mark} in accuracy and remote sensing [are so integral
to]{.mark} modern [conventional war]{.mark}fare]{.underline} --
[[and]{.mark} modern [society]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly
[[impossible to halt]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if arms controllers
could come up with clever treaty designs.

The implications of the new era of counterforce extend beyond the wisdom
of future nuclear arms control. First, [if nuclear forces are becoming
easier to attack, then all else being equal, nuclear]{.underline}-armed
states [need to deploy more capable retaliatory arsenals]{.underline} to
counter the growing risks. Whether one believes that a deterrent force
must present potential attackers with "near-certain retaliation,"
"likely retaliation," or some other level of risk, improvements in
counterforce systems require that retaliatory forces adapt -- through
better capabilities, increased numbers, or both -- to maintain the same
level of deterrent threat. Furthermore, [the rapid rate of change in
counterforce technologies increases uncertainty about adversaries'
future capabilities]{.underline} -- suggesting that countries will need
to retain diverse retaliatory forces as a hedge against adversary
breakthroughs.

Second, one should ask whether it is wise for the United States in
particular to continue improving its nuclear and non-nuclear
counterforce capabilities. On the one hand, improved counterforce
capabilities could be invaluable in a range of plausible scenarios --
particularly in a crisis or conventional war when an adversary threatens
or has begun to escalate. Improved offensive capabilities could help the
United States deter weak countries from initiating conventional
conflicts or from escalating in the midst of war. Enhanced counterforce
capabilities could also help protect US forces, allies, and the US
homeland from nuclear attack if a conventional war did escalate. On the
other hand, [better counterforce could be a source of danger: not only
might improved disarming strike capabilities -- in any country's hands
-- increase the temptation to attack]{.underline}, but [also [potential
victims]{.mark} of disarming strikes [will seek to escape]{.mark} their
[vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby possibly
[[triggering]{.underline}]{.mark} arms racing and [[incentives to strike
pre-emptively]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Ultimately, both views about the wisdom of enhancing counterforce
capabilities may be correct. The net benefit will therefore depend on
the particular case. For countries that perceive a highly malign threat
environment, face aggressive nuclear-armed adversaries, or have
ambitious foreign policy goals, the benefits of developing advanced
counterforce capabilities may outweigh the costs. For those countries
that face a benign environment and have more modest goals, however, the
secondary costs of enhancing counterforce may be too great. In either
case, however, policymakers and analysts need to reckon with the ways
that rapidly changing technologies are eroding the foundation of
deterrence and nuclear arms control. In a world where [[nuclear]{.mark}

Consider the actions of the United States' two great-power adversaries
when it comes to anti-satellite weapons. [[China and Russia]{.mark}
have [sprinted to develop]{.mark} and deploy both
[ground]{.mark}]{.underline}-based [[and space-based weapons
targeting]{.mark} satellites [while simultaneously pushing]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to sign a [treaty]{.mark}
banning such weapons]{.underline}.

To protect its vital space-based military capabilities---including
communications, intelligence, and missile defense satellites---and
effectively deter authoritarian aggression, [Washington should avoid
being drawn into suspect international treaties on space that [China and
Russia have no intention of honoring]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space
and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects (PPWT),
which Beijing and Moscow have submitted at the United Nations, is a
perfect example. PPWT signatories commit "not to place any weapons in
outer space." It also says parties to the treaty may not "resort to the
threat or use of force against outer space objects" or engage in
activities "inconsistent" with the purpose of the treaty.

On the surface, that sounds innocuous. Who, after all, wants an arms
race in space?

The reality, however, is that [China and Russia are already racing to
field anti-satellite weapons and have been for quite some
time]{.underline}. "The space domain is competitive, congested, and
contested," Gen. James Dickinson, the head of U.S. Space
Command, said in January. "Our competitors, most notably China and
Russia, have militarized this domain."

Beijing already has an operational ground-based anti-satellite missile
capability. People's Liberation Army units are training with the
missiles, and the U.S. Defense Department believes Beijing "probably
intends to pursue additional \[anti-satellite\] weapons capable of
destroying satellites up to geosynchronous Earth orbit." That is where
America's most sensitive nuclear communication and missile defense
satellites orbit and keep watch.

Similarly, Moscow tested a ground-based anti-satellite weapon in
December that could destroy U.S. or allied satellites in orbit. That
attack capability augments a ground-based laser weapon that Russian
President Vladimir Putin heralded in 2018. In a moment of candor,
Russia's defense ministry admitted the system was designed to "fight
satellites."

To make matters worse, [both]{.underline} countries [are]{.underline}
also [working to deploy space-based]{.underline}---or so-called
"on-orbit"---[capabilities to attack satellites]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, at the United Nations and other international
forums, China and Russia are pushing the PPWT and advocating for a "no
first placement" resolution---saying all governments should commit not
to be the first to put weapons in space.

Yet more than two years ago, the U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency noted that both China and Russia were already putting in space
capabilities that could be used as weapons. The PPWT would thus protect
their weapons while tying Washington's hands.

In a thinly veiled attempt to mask their intentions, the two countries
claim that their on-orbit capabilities are simply for peaceful
purposes---for assessing the condition of broken satellites and
conducting repairs as needed. This "dual-use" disguise permits Beijing
and Moscow to put into orbit ostensibly peaceful or commercial
capabilities that those countries can actually use to disable or destroy
U.S. military and intelligence satellites.

China, for example, has tested several so-called scavenger satellites,
which use grappling arms to capture other satellites. China has also
demonstrated the capability to maneuver a satellite around
the geosynchronous belt, allowing its satellites to sidle up to other
satellites in space.

Not to be outdone, Russia deployed a pair of "nesting doll" satellites
that shadowed a U.S. satellite in space. One Russian satellite birthed
another, with Russia's defense ministry claiming its purpose was to
assess the "technical condition of domestic satellites."

But later, the second satellite conducted a weapons test, firing what
appeared to be a space torpedo. The Kremlin never explained how a
fast-moving one-time projectile provided superior inspection benefits
compared with the other Russian satellite flying persistently nearby.

A well-crafted treaty that clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable
actions in space and includes tough and realistic inspection and
verification mechanisms could promote security and stability. But the
PPWT is decidedly not that kind of treaty.

For starters, the proposed [[treaty does not]{.mark} explicitly
[prohibit]{.mark} the ground-based anti-satellite [weapons that China
and Russia have]{.mark} already [fielded. Nor]{.mark}]{.underline} does
the proposed treaty [prevent the deployment of space-based weapons under
the [cloak of civilian]{.mark} or commercial
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. The PPWT also does not prohibit the
development, testing, or stockpiling of weapons on Earth that could be
quickly put into orbit.

Even if [these deficiencies]{.underline} were addressed, the PPWT
[[lacks]{.mark} any [verification]{.mark} plan [to ensure
compliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, the treaty calls for
"transparency and confidence-building measures" implemented on a
"voluntary basis." In other words, [Beijing and Moscow want the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to trust but never
verify]{.underline}.

But then again, Americans should not be surprised by the PPWT. Moscow
habitually seeks to use international arms control treaties to constrain
the United States while viewing treaty strictures as optional when they
become inconvenient or when the Kremlin sees an opportunity to seize a
military advantage.

For more than a decade before its demise in 2019, Moscow used the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to constrain the United States
while the Kremlin produced, flight-tested, and fielded a ground-launched
intermediate-range cruise missile in direct contravention of the treaty.
Beijing, for its part, often exhibits an allergy to serious
international arms control treaties. The willingness of the Chinese
Communist Party to support the PPWT is, therefore, cause for some
additional reflection in Washington.

So instead of falling prey to China and Russia's PPWT trap, the United
States must urgently work with allies to improve the resilience and
redundancy of spaced-based military and intelligence capabilities.

Washington should also advance nascent efforts to establish rules of the
road in space. "There are really no norms of behavior in space," Gen.
John Raymond, the chief of space operations at U.S. Space
Force, said this month. "It's the wild, wild West."

In a notable and positive step, [the [U.N. G]{.mark}]{.underline}eneral
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ssembly [[passed]{.mark} a]{.underline}
British-introduced [[resolution]{.underline}]{.mark} in December that
seeks [[to establish]{.mark} "norms, rules and principles of responsible
[behaviours]{.mark}" in space]{.underline}, which could reduce the
chances for dangerous miscalculation.

[The vote was 164 in favor, including the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates---[and]{.underline} a mere [[12
opposed]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Any guesses regarding [[who voted no?]{.underline}]{.mark} You guessed
it: [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. They
were joined by their friends [[Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and
Cuba]{.underline}]{.mark}.

So much for a [Chinese and Russian]{.underline} desire to pursue
constructive and peaceful policies in space. Their [[duplicity
continues]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Elusive definitions

[Treaties that ban or control weapons must define]{.underline} what,
exactly, they aim to ban or control. [Without an ASAT
definition]{.underline} that is simultaneously inclusive and precise,
[[international regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} preventing the development,
deployment, and use of ASATs [[are ineffective]{.mark}. Two obstacles
make constructing a]{.underline} useful [definition]{.underline} nearly
[impossible]{.underline}: weaponry diversity and the dual-use problem.

[The [variety of]{.mark} potential]{.underline} ASAT [[weaponry
presents]{.mark} a [problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. ASAT weapons are any
technology that can temporarily or permanently disable or destroy a
satellite's functionality. This means [[lasers]{.mark} and other
directed [energy]{.mark} weapons, air- and land-launched
[kinetic]{.mark} missiles, [cyber]{.mark} uplink and downlink attacks,
radiofrequency [jamming]{.mark} attacks, [attacks on ground]{.mark}
stations, [and maneuverable]{.mark} attack [satellites are all ASAT
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The diversity of ASAT weapons makes articulating a sufficiently
comprehensive and precise definition impossible. [[Any attempt]{.mark}
to do so [will]{.mark} inevitably [leave]{.mark} significant
[loopholes]{.mark} because each [technology exists in]{.mark} a
[separate domain defined by unique]{.mark} operational
[requirements]{.mark}, norms, and expectations that require specific
rules and regulations to control]{.underline}.

[Controlling these technologies is especially difficult given most have
legitimate, peaceful, or commonplace uses. [Satellites]{.mark} are
fragile]{.underline}. It takes little force to render them temporarily
or permanently ineffective. [When a target is [defined by fragility,
everything becomes a weapon, meaning]{.mark} innocent and [commonplace
technologies]{.mark} can [be weaponized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Remotely
operated repair satellites, for instance, are being developed to
revitalize failing satellites.\[5\] But the same capabilities used to
repair can be repurposed to destroy. Similarly, any satellite equipped
with a radiofrequency antenna necessary to receive signals can also emit
them with sufficient strength to jam the communications of nearby
satellites.\[6\] [This [dual-use]{.mark} problem [presents]{.mark} an
[obstacle for]{.mark}]{.underline} ASAT [[arms control]{.mark} by
pitting legitimate and peaceful operational freedom against national
security]{.underline}.

The PPWT defines a weapon as "any outer space object or its component
produced or converted to eliminate, damage or disrupt normal functioning
of objects in outer space."\[7\] But by the most literal interpretation
of this language, almost everything can be classified as an ASAT and
cannot be put into space. The PPWT does not even attempt to address ASAT
weapons that are deployed from the ground. [Effective
definitions]{.underline} elude the PPWT and will also [elude future arms
control attempts]{.underline}.

#### 2. [VERIFICATION]{.underline} is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--[technological]{.underline} AND [trust]{.underline} deficiencies.

Verification problems

To identify and differentiate between compliance and disobedience, the
international community must be able to identify and characterize
objects in orbit. International arms control treaties cannot rely on
goodwill alone. Verification capabilities must therefore be an inherent
part of any agreement that restricts the use or deployment of weaponry.

But it won't be in outer space---[[no reliable verification
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} currently
[[exist]{.underline}]{.mark}. Once an asset is deployed in orbit,
[[it's]{.mark} remarkably [difficult to tell what it is and]{.mark} what
it is [capable of]{.mark} doing. [For non-physical]{.mark}
weapons]{.underline}, like cyber and jamming capabilities, [[there are
no means]{.mark} to verify compliance]{.underline}. Any attempt to ban
non-physical ASAT weapons would rely exclusively on trust. The PPWT
seeks to bar signatories from placing "any weapons in outer space."\[8\]
[[It's mere finger-wagging more than]{.mark} an [enforceable]{.mark}
rule without a means to verify compliance]{.underline}.

Advocates for ASAT arms control would disagree, pointing to modern space
situational awareness capabilities that can detect space launches and
track the orbital inclination of their payloads through space-based
infrared and infrasound monitoring systems.\[9\] Even if states can
track objects that are placed into orbit, "verifying the function of a
particular space object already in orbit is significantly more
difficult."\[10\] The "PAXSAT A" study demonstrated that uncovering the
functionality of satellites in orbit is possible by utilizing a
four-satellite constellation.\[11\] But this investigation method relies
on the ability of the constellation to position itself near the object
in question and the assumption that form follows function. Two problems
are presented here. First, [[we do not have]{.mark} the [infrastructure
to conduct]{.mark} on-orbit [investigations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Second, the logic that form follows function is fallible. Because space
launches are expensive, advocates argue that the extra weight and cost
needed to obscure the true function of an ASAT weapon in orbit with
facade architecture is too expensive to be realistic. But [basing [arms
control]{.mark} agreements [on]{.mark} the [predicted frugality]{.mark}
of nation-states [seems illogical]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best.

Even with perfect launch monitoring capabilities, [significant unknowns
remain. Many space-related armaments are
[ground-based]{.mark}]{.underline}, meaning these weapons can be
developed and deployed outside of the scope of current ASAT monitoring
systems. Also, [for [non-physical]{.mark} weapons, verification is
simply impossible. No mechanism exists]{.underline}, for example, [to
verify compliance with moratoriums against developing or deploying
[cyberweapons or jamming]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}.

In short, [effective [verification]{.mark} mechanisms [would be costly,
complicated, and ineffective]{.mark}. And without]{.underline}
verification capabilities, [useful arms control agreements are
hopeless]{.underline}.

#### 3. [ATTRIBUTION]{.underline} is [foundational]{.underline}, BUT [impossible]{.underline}.

Attribution problems

Attribution, the ability to identify a violation and legitimately tie it
to an actor, is a key ingredient of arms control agreements. [The
[ability to attribute]{.mark} violations [is key to]{.mark} justifying
the [invoking]{.mark} of [punishments in accordance with]{.mark}
international treaty [law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus,
[[attribution]{.mark} capabilities [are]{.mark} the [foundation
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a deterrence [[mechanism that makes arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark} agreements [[attractive and
practical]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Attribution capabilities, or the lack thereof, present another problem
for ASAT arms control. Some forms of ASAT attacks are attributable.
Others are not. Non-physical threats, for instance, are particularly
difficult to tie actions to national actors.

In the event a [[laser]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, is used
against a space asset, satellite operators would have a difficult time
identifying the actor responsible for the attack. In the harsh
environment of space, systems frequently fail without explanation.
Unless the targeted satellite is equipped with sensors that could
identify "a spike in thermal energy or sudden saturation of optical
sensors," there is no way to differentiate between a random satellite
failure and a malicious laser attack.\[12\] And even if such
capabilities exist, there is no guarantee one could attribute the
laser's use to a national actor.

[[Jamming]{.underline}]{.mark} attacks are similarly difficult to
attribute. Satellites use a narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum
to communicate. The crowded nature of orbits today means it is common
for multiple space assets to use similar or identical frequencies and,
as a result, routinely unintentionally jam the communications of a
neighboring satellite.\[13\] Differentiating between intentional and
unintentional jamming is difficult, if not impossible. In this
environment, verification and compliance mechanisms are complicated to
construct.

Recent [[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} have laid bare the difficult,
lengthy, and uncertain process of attributing, much less identifying and
understanding, cyber incursions. The Russian SolarWinds hack
demonstrated a lack of an ability to definitively identify the scope and
duration of a cyber penetration.\[14\] Similar problems will
[[plague]{.mark} efforts to assert [arms control]{.mark}
regimes]{.underline} on cyber ASAT weapons.

Approach 2: Long-Term Multilateral Reductions

Summary. Approach 2 would be difficult to achieve without a breakthrough
in international relations, but the proposed two-step process provides a
possible pathway. Yet without assuming the more benign security
environment required to make this approach a reality, the resulting
[[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} outcomes [[would result in negative
changes]{.mark} across evaluated criteria]{.underline}. Specifically,
the vast [reductions in U.S. nuclear forces would present risks to
strategic stability and extended deterrence, while the specific focus on
nuclear arsenals may not adequately address new
technologies]{.underline} in a way that positively affects U.S.
competitive advantage.

Strategic Stability: Negative to Neutral. Approach 2 retains
U.S.-Russian stability while bringing China into an official
framework.92 Strategic exchange calculations show [[that a secure
second-strike]{.mark} capability [remains for both the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} with little relative change from the
percentage of arriving forces compared to today's New START--limited
regime (tables 14 and 15), supporting a neutral rating.
[[One]{.underline}]{.mark} possible [[destabilizing trend can be
considered under Russia]{.mark}'s worst-case scenario]{.underline}
(day-to-day forces and electing to "ride out" the attack under the 500
warhead limit), [[in which "only" 39 warheads would reach
targets]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. At this
low number, [[Moscow could]{.mark} [argue]{.mark} that U.S. [BMD]{.mark}
systems [and]{.mark} conventional]{.underline} [[prompt-strike]{.mark}
capabilities [present a destabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline} "splendid"
[[first-strike capability]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[erosion of Russia's]{.mark}
[second-strike]{.mark} capability could]{.underline} also [[foster
a]{.mark} "[use]{.mark} th[em]{.mark} [or lose]{.mark} th[em]{.mark}"
scenario]{.underline} in a major crisis.
