### AC Good---overfishing/Arctic ecosytems

#### Chinese overfishing in the Arctic now---wrecks [Arctic ecosystems]{.underline} and [maritime norms]{.underline}

**Bodtke et. Al 25** (Rebecca Bodtke is a United States Air Force pilot
and researcher, June 9, 2025, "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Dead Fish:
The Fish Fight in the Arctic", Over The Horizon Journal,
https://othjournal.com/2025/06/09/one-fish-two-fish-red-fish-dead-fish-the-fish-fight-in-the-arctic/)

[[China's]{.mark} DWF fleet's [history of operating in]{.mark} foreign
exclusive economic zones [(EEZs) and international waters raises
concerns]{.mark} [about its potential future operations in Arctic
waters]{.mark}]{.underline}. While China currently lacks a direct
fishing presence in the Arctic, [expanding its fleet into adjacent areas
could be a precursor to more active involvement. The [Arctic's]{.mark}
rich [marine biodiversity and economic potential make it a likely target
for Chinese fishing interests]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}.

China's Involvement

China is a signatory to the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement
(CAOFA), which prohibits any country from fishing in the high seas
portion of the central Arctic Ocean until a joint scientific program can
ensure the sustainability of the potential fisheries. Currently, there
are no Chinese fishing vessels in the Arctic; however, China continues
to play a role in processing Alaskan seafood and employing workers in
Greenland.

[While the stated policy is framed as cooperative, its aggressive
fishing practices tell a different story. Its [track record]{.mark} in
other regions [suggests a willingness to disregard international
agreements]{.mark} when it serves their interests. China's [involvement
in Arctic-adjacent fisheries has already led to concerns over stock
depletion and illegal fishing]{.mark} activities. Chinese [DWF vessels
have been linked to overfishing in the North Pacific and Antarctic
waters]{.mark}. Similar [behavior in Arctic waters could destabilize
local ecosystems and undermine]{.mark} existing [regulatory
frameworks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[China's [DWF has expanded its reach into Arctic]{.mark} and sub-Arctic
[waters, targeting fish stocks that are crucial]{.mark} to the
ecosystems and economies of Arctic nations. China's fishing practices in
international waters adjacent to the Arctic, ]{.underline}including
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing[, have led to
significant stock depletion in other regions and could pose a threat to
Arctic marine biodiversity. The [growing presence of Chinese vessels
also raises concerns about enforcement]{.mark}, as monitoring vast and
remote Arctic waters challenges the capacity of coastal
states.]{.underline}

The Ecological Impact of Overfishing

[The [Arctic Ocean is experiencing significant ecological shifts due to
climate change]{.mark}. [Increasing sea surface temperatures, changes in
regional oceanography,]{.mark} and the [decline of permanent sea
ice]{.mark} are altering the composition of marine ecosystems. [Ocean
acidification]{.mark}, driven by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels, is another pressing issue. [The Arctic Ocean is warming and
acidifying faster than most other regions, affecting the distributions
and productivity of key specie]{.mark}s such as Arctic cod, red king
crab, and tanner crab. These [species play vital roles in the ecosystem,
supporting predators]{.mark} like seals, seabirds, and polar
bears.]{.underline}

[[As a greater portion of the central Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free for
longer periods, commercial fishing opportunities are likely to
increase]{.mark}. Approximately]{.underline}[ 15%[ of the world's marine
fisheries are caught in the Subarctic and Arctic, primarily from large
commercial fisheries]{.underline}]{.mark} [in regions such as the
Barents Sea, the Central North Atlantic, and the Bering
Sea]{.underline}. In contrast, the interior Arctic shelves have
supported smaller subsistence fisheries. However, [[the warming waters
are causing species to shift northward]{.mark}, increasing the
likelihood of commercial expansion into previously untouched
areas]{.underline}.

Economic and Sovereignty Concerns

[[Sustainable fishing is an economic lifeline and a cultural cornerstone
for Arctic nations]{.mark} like Norway, Iceland, and Canada. [China's
incursion into Arctic fisheries undermines local industries]{.mark} and
threatens long-term financial stability]{.underline}. [[IUU fishing also
creates economic disparity]{.mark}, as Chinese vessels exploit resources
without adhering to international agreements or local regulations. IUU
fishing undermines local economies [and erodes
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Chinese vessels in Arctic waters
[could create flashpoints over fishing rights, particularly in contested
areas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The Arctic's [ecosystems are]{.mark} not only [crucial for]{.mark}
biodiversity but also for the subsistence [lifestyles of Indigenous
peoples.]{.mark} Indigenous [communities rely on these ecosystems for
traditional]{.mark} hunting, fishing, and gathering [practices,]{.mark}
which are deeply intertwined with their cultural heritage and
livelihoods. [Their subsistence activities are directly threatened by
overfishing]{.mark} and environmental degradation, [particularly from
external actors]{.mark} like China.]{.underline}

#### Arctic council heg [unifies member states]{.underline} and [dampens tensions]{.underline}---empirically solves overfishing.

**Doubleday 15** (Nancy Doubleday holds a PHD from Queens University and

fishing in the Arctic any time soon -- and that's a good thing",

[Last Thursday, [five Arctic nations]{.mark} (USA, Canada, Russia,
Greenland-Denmark and Norway) [signed an accord to prohibit commercial
fleets from]{.mark} conducting [industrial fishing]{.mark} in the
Central Arctic.]{.underline}

[This action [demonstrates that social learning in complex systems is
not only possible, but that it can find political will]{.mark} and
express itself.]{.underline}

[It also [reaffirms visions of cooperation articulated by Inuit
organizations, scientists and politicians]{.mark}, both nationally and
internationally, for many decades]{.underline}.

Driven by conditions offering a relatively easy win (no commercial
fleets are operating there now), coupled with past experience of
overfishing and fisheries collapses (e.g. Pollock in Alaska, cod in New
England and Atlantic Canada), and the shifting of fish stocks in
relation to climate (noted by Norway), there is incentive to cooperate.

[The [alignment of scientists, some 2,000 of which signed on to a
petition in favour of the ban, with the politically attractive link to
assertions of state sovereignty, also provided incentives]{.mark} for
this accord.]{.underline}

Notwithstanding specific disputes among parties elsewhere (for example
over Ukraine, which caused the signing of the accord to shift from 2014
to 2015), it is likely [[that the players understand the value of the
preemptive prohibition of commercial fleets in the Central Arctic not
only as an environmental win, but as an]{.mark} [easy diplomatic
gain]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Also, [the United States has just assumed the leadership of the Arctic
Counci]{.mark}l, a coordinating body of eight Arctic states, and
permanent observers from key regional Indigenous peoples' organizations,
(as well as non-Arctic states), [and is moving quickly to establish its
agenda.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This collaboration in the Arctic is encouraging]{.mark}. Current
governmental efforts are moving toward reason and cooperation in a
region that is sensitive, both environmentally and politically. [Despite
increased conflict in the world, progress is being made in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[It remains for Canada and her Arctic neighbours to press other fishing
nations to adopt this accord,]{.mark} [and to use the renewal of Arctic
cooperation to address collateral issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Can the
goodwill resulting from this thawing of foreign relations in the Arctic
be applied to efforts to reduce the impact of forces driving sea ice
loss?

#### Arctic ecosystems are [uniquely]{.underline} important for [global climate models]{.underline}---only Arctic Council leadership can [reverse]{.underline} the trend.

//JAY JAY!!! 

[The [Arctic Ocean]{.mark} is home to diverse marine species and [unique
ecosystems]{.mark}, and it cryosphere [plays a significant role in
moderating the Earth's climate.]{.mark} The [Arctic]{.mark} marine
[environment]{.mark} also [provides cultural identity, food security and
a source of income for many of the region's
inhabitants.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But climate change is transforming the Arctic Ocean at an increasingly
rapid rate. [[Record-high]{.mark} air [temperatures and melting]{.mark}
sea [ice are]{.mark} two important [indicators of]{.mark} many dramatic,
[ongoing changes.]{.mark} Along with these come [opportunities for
industrial **development**,]{.mark} which is [exposing marine
life]{.mark} in this vulnerable environment t[o increased
risks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The question that naturally arises is: [how can we best safeguard and
manage the Arctic marine environment now and in the future?]{.underline}
This question is especially difficult to answer given that the Arctic's
integrated, complex ecosystem---characterized by interactions between
nature and humans---is undergoing rapid change throughout its entire
structure.

But one way to address this question is to be "future smart." [[The
latest]{.mark} global [climate models]{.mark} can [tell us what the
Arctic's]{.mark} atmosphere-[ocean]{.mark} system [might look like in
the future.]{.mark} Equipped [with this]{.mark} knowledge, [we]{.mark}
have a chance to [improve and advance]{.mark} the stewardship of [the
Arctic Ocean by]{.mark} implementing [ecosystem-based
management.]{.mark} This could include locating future refugia and
establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) to ensure
sustainable development, resilience and adaptation.]{.underline}

This approach---giving nature some elbow room to adapt to the inevitable
changes---will ensure resilience for Arctic biodiversity. [Basing
conservation efforts on a pan-Arctic network of MPAs will help meet new
ambitious international conservation targets, such as those proposed by
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is
calling for 30 per cent protection by 2030 (also known as the "30 by 30"
goal). Such efforts will help safeguard the critical ecosystem functions
that the world depends upon.]{.underline}

We can also establish conservation areas and balance them with economic
use by applying an ecosystem approach to marine planning and management.
[But this]{.underline} will require a strong governance structure across
the Arctic and [must include areas beyond national
jurisdiction.]{.underline} [[Collaboration among Arctic states
to]{.mark} formulate and [implement]{.mark} global [agreements is key to
viable and strong governance of the Central Arctic
Ocean.]{.mark}]{.underline} These states stand to benefit from a strong,
united voice if they cooperate in ongoing negotiations under the
auspices of the UN General Assembly's Implementing Agreement on Marine
Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJs).

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}---the Arctic region's main
governance body---[[could be an active]{.mark} and ambitious [leader of
the]{.mark} BBNJ [process]{.mark}, either [through its
chairmanship]{.mark} with a corresponding mandate [or through
coordination among member states']{.mark} delegations]{.underline}.
[This is an opportunity for the Council to tackle Arctic-specific needs
as it shapes the final global agreement and regional
implementation.]{.underline}

WWF's Arctic Programme is coordinating and leading key projects on
networks of MPAs, species conservation and refugia, governance structure
and sustainable development. This issue of *The Circle* explores these
issues and more from different perspectives.

[[It is imperative that]{.mark} Arctic and non-Arctic [nations curb the
release of greenhouse gases and address]{.mark} the impacts of [climate
change]{.mark} on the Arctic Ocean, including its dramatic effects on
biodiversity, habitats, wildlife and ecosystem services. [This work must
include]{.mark} deep transformational [change across all]{.mark} sectors
and [nations. By solving for the future now, we are investing in a
resilient and healthy Arctic]{.mark} from 2050 onward.]{.underline}

[[The conclusion reached by the United States that an increased presence
in the Arctic is necessary results from the fact that both the situation
and the perception of threats have changed]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
March 2020, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, Commander of the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), stated in Congress: '[[The
Arctic is no longer a fortress wall, and our oceans are no longer
protective moats]{.underline}]{.mark}'.14 According to the [U.S. Air
Force's Arctic Strategy, the Arctic is part of both North America (U.S.
Northern Command, USNORTHCOM) and the Indo-Pacific (U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command, USINDOPACOM), two highly important areas]{.underline}.15 In
fact, [[all branches of the American armed forces and three of the most
important combatant commands]{.mark} -- including USNORTHCOM, USEUCOM
(U.S. European Command) and USINDOPACOM -- [consider the Arctic]{.mark},
in whole or in part, as [a portion of their military area of
responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Experts from the German Marshall
Fund criticise that this 'complicate\[s\] the implementation of an
integrated strategic mission'16 as [[the Arctic is becoming]{.mark}
increasingly [important for all major powers bordering the Atlantic
Ocean and the (Indo-)Pacific as regards their efforts to project
military power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AC good\-- warming

#### The Arctic Council is key to solve global warming and awareness

Arctic Defense Security Network, PHD candidate in political science,
April 20, 2022, "Why freezing the Arctic Council is bad news for global
security", Colorado State University,

[For the past quarter-century[, the Arctic has been a unique zone of
cooperation]{.mark} among the eight countries of the high north: Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.
[Even when relations between Moscow and the West soured]{.mark},
the [Arctic Council's work was a reminder that multilateral partnerships
could thrive]{.mark} despite global discord]{.underline}.

[The point of the Arctic Council is to foster collaboration in areas
such as scientific research, search and rescue operations and the
challenges posed by climate change. Under its auspices, friends and
adversaries alike -- as well as nonstate actors, such as Indigenous
groups -- can sit down, talk and find common ground. [In early 2022,
lawmakers from Norway nominated the council for the Nobel Peace
Prize]{.mark} for its collaborative spirit.]{.underline}

[That collaboration ended shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022. One week [after the start of the war]{.mark}, seven of
the eight Arctic Council members announced that they would "pause" their
work with the organization. [Russia, which holds the council's
presidency through 2023, was left ostracized.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The freeze of the Arctic Council is a loss on many fronts. As
at scholar of Arctic security, I see cooperation in the region as
essential to global security]{.mark}, and I believe an expanded set of
institutions is needed to reflect new global realities as the Arctic
warms.]{.underline}

Security and cooperation in the Arctic

The eight Arctic countries formed the Arctic Council in 1996. While the
council [explicitly steers clear of military issues,]{.underline} [[its
members are stewards of the Arctic region.]{.mark} Unsurprisingly, the
organization has grown in importance with global warming.]{.underline}

[[Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new shipping
routes and,]{.mark} likely, [expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas
and other critical minerals -- changes that could spur
conflict]{.mark} if not handled carefully.]{.underline}

[Through the council, the [Arctic states have made agreements related
to search and rescue operations, oil pollution and scientific
collaboration. The council has tracked environmental change]{.mark}s in
the region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment reports.
Even [when relations between East and West were at their worst]{.mark},
including in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula
from Ukraine, [joint endeavors]{.mark} in the Arctic [remained
strong]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## No Arctic conflict

### No Arctic conflict

#### Most Arctic impacts are overblown and Arctic territorial disputes don't exist

**Osthagen 23** (Andreas Osthagen has a PHD in IR from the University of
British Columbia and was a Harvard Fulbright scholar. He is a research
professor at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo and directs research
in Arctic and ocean politics, June 1, 2023, "Five Misconceptions in
Arctic Security and Geopolitics", The Arctic Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/five-misconceptions-arctic-security-geopolitics/)

There are no disputes over "territory"

Let us start with the most obvious. [[No territorial disputes remain in
the Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}. [No land border]{.underline}
between any of the eight Arctic [states is in dispute. No Arctic state
is currently claiming another Arctic state's territory]{.underline} for
historic reasons or to protect an ethnic minority. Furthermore, no
island is in dispute (the last minor island dispute was settled between
Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark in 2022).

The closest situations to a dispute over sovereignty concern the legal
status of shipping through Canadian and Russian territorial waters and
domestic discussions in some Arctic countries
about indigenous/local rights and land ownership.

[At sea, 7 out of 8 maritime boundaries are ]{.underline}agreed. Of
these, [only one remains: between Canada and the United States in the
Beaufort Sea. This is in stark contrast to ]{.underline}other maritime
domains[ around the world encircled by states]{.underline} (the
Mediterranean, the South China Sea and the Caribbean).

However, a dispute is likely to emerge over extended continental shelves
in the Arctic. This issue might lead to a diplomatic spat and even be
used in a larger power game between Russia and the West. It is not,
despite what some argue, likely to be a primary driver of conflict
between any of the Arctic states. Crucially, it is also important to
note that [[the seabed is not the same as
"]{.underline}territory]{.mark}".

There are indeed other disputes in the Arctic relating to sovereign
rights at sea over who gets what share of living marine resources; where
to delineate or delimit maritime space (although these are limited in
scope); and over what rules apply along transarctic shipping lanes as
well as in the Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard. But [these are
not disputes over territory or sovereignty,]{.underline} and it helps to
be clear exactly what type of [[dispute]{.underline}]{.mark} you are
talking about, as [they [tend to rely on rather different legal,
economic and political rationales and dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Number of icebreakers tells you little

Arctic-related stories love to count how many icebreakers the Arctic
countries have. This is often done to showcase how Russia
is dominating in the Arctic and the USA is a laggard. The main problem
here is that [icebreakers are ]{.underline}contextual.

A range of different [[factors explain why Russia has the number of
icebreakers it has: the size of its Arctic coastline, economic activity
in that area, and ice conditions]{.mark} (which is why you have a
breaker-of-ice in the first place]{.underline}). This is beside the
intra-institutional set-ups of each Arctic coastal state concerning
coast guard / navy tasks and whether icebreakers are even useful for the
latter.

Do not get me wrong. There is no doubt that the USA is in need of more
icebreakers. It currently has only two operational ones: the USCGC Healy
from 1999 and the USCGC Polar Star from 1976. Moreover,
icebreakers are important for a number of reasons, including their
ability to support ship traffic, keep harbours open in wintertime, and
conduct research at high latitudes.

However, [[icebreakers are not the ultimate sign of strength or military
power in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Other parameters, such as
military expenditure, presence and capabilities (beyond breaking ice),
are better suited.

In most instances, [icebreakers are not even operated by the various
Arctic countries' armed forces.]{.underline} [Why does Finland have four
times as many as the USA when it is not even an Arctic coastal state?
Because the country needs to break ice in the Gulf of
Bothnia]{.underline} and is attempting to reap commercial benefits
from icebreaking services.

As such, the numbers of icebreakers do not demonstrate the Russian
Arctic threat---there are [other things that are more relevant for that,
ranging from ]{.underline}military capacities (like subsea or surface
naval vessels, or airborne capabilities) [to ]{.underline}patterns of
behaviour (like military exercises, troop posture, statements).

Be specific about what resources and where

Resources undoubtedly play a role in Arctic (geo)politics, but they come
in many shapes and colours and are located in various Arctic
geographies. [[There are a lot of resources in the Arctic:]{.mark}
discovered and undiscovered, accessible and inaccessible, commercially
viable and non-viable]{.underline}. [[Does this mean that the Arctic is
"resource-rich"? Probably no more than the Mediterranean, the South
China Sea, or the middle of the Pacific.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[First, which resources are we talking about? Where?]{.underline} There
is a difference between gas fields located in the Norwegian part of the
Barents Sea and oil wells in Norman Wells in the Canadian Northwest
Territories, or between aquaculture facilities off the coast of Iceland
and snow crab catching off the coast of Alaska. The Arctic varies
widely when it comes to resource availability, potential and extraction.

Second, is the resource commercially interesting, even relevant, over
the next two or three decades---on a global scale? For what purpose is
the resource highlighted in connection to geopolitics? [Too often [the
Arctic resource potential is used to underscore other
things]{.underline}]{.mark}[, such as political attention from
non-Arctic Actors (read China) or ]{.underline}military tension[ in the
region]{.underline}.

However, [it is seldom possible to link military tension with Arctic
resource extraction and/or potential]{.underline}. [Even Chinese
interest in Arctic resources tends to be specific in terms of both where
and what, beyond just a general resource interest.]{.underline}

Governance means more than the Arctic Council

On [May 11 this year, Norway ]{.underline}took over the chair [of the
Arctic Council]{.underline} as Russia passed the reins after two years
(2021--2023) of what must be said to be a rather bleak chairmanship
period[. [In March 2022, when the other seven Arctic states decided to
pause cooperation with Russia, the Arctic Council was
quickly ]{.underline}declared [dead and buried.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Even the future of Arctic governance was questioned. Alas, reality is
more complex.

Cooperation with Russia has remained on single low-level issues for
those countries that share a border or boundary with the country,
namely, Finland, Norway and the USA in particular. In addition, the
Arctic Council has survived and will likely continue to do so.
[However, ]{.underline}Arctic governance[ does not stand or fall within
the Arctic Council.]{.underline}

Governance is a term used to describe how to deal with problems, in this
instance in an Arctic context. Most governance structures are found at
the national level, which at the end of the day sets the rules and
regulations for what can be done in the various Arctic territories. Some
governance problems, such as the need for a moratorium on fisheries in
the Central Arctic Ocean, are indeed raised to the international level,
either because a joint solution is needed to effectively manage or deal
with a problem or because the countries have a shared interest in
collaborating and can thus reap additional benefits through scale and
spillover effects.

In this regard, [[the Arctic Council plays]{.mark}]{.underline} an
important but [[essentially
a ]{.underline}minor[ role]{.underline}]{.mark}. First and foremost, it
provides scientific advice [[and reports through its different working
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, led by experts from the Arctic countries
and the six indigenous representations (and some non-Arctic
representatives too). Second, the Arctic Council and its ministerial
meetings every second year act as a lightning rod for attention to
Arctic international relations. The Arctic states have themselves
promoted this forum as the primary arena for Arctic issues because it
helped convey the message of a peaceful, stable and cooperative Arctic
region.

However, [[if one examines ]{.underline}governance[ in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[institutions like the UN Law of the Sea,
the Polar Code, the EU, or even bilateral agreements]{.mark} between
Arctic states on coast guard cooperation, fisheries management, and
cultural and educational exchange and cooperation tend to be [much more
impactful and far-reachin]{.mark}g in terms of dealing with
Arctic-specific problems]{.underline}. That does not mean the Arctic
Council is irrelevant, just that it is one---albeit much talked
about---piece in a larger Arctic governance puzzle.

Specify what role climate change / ice melting plays

Finally, the melting elephant in the Arctic room is always climate
change. [[Climate change is]{.mark}, of course, [the background of many
Arctic-related stories]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is also the case in
the social sciences. However, does ice melting, for example, play a
causal role in what we write about? Is ice melting a factor behind
Russia's military buildup? Is ice melting a factor leading to concerns
about resource governance? Is ice melting prompting Chinese interests?

[Too often, climate change and its various Arctic effects [are used
to ]{.mark}]{.underline}[highlight the relevance[ and importance of the
region, but the actual causal linkages with the object of study are not
clearly spelled out.]{.underline}]{.mark} [In many instances, [climate
change is---at best---a contextual factor]{.mark} with little or no
direct bearing on the question at hand]{.underline}, at least when we
examine geopolitics and (military) security relations in the Arctic.

To put it in a different way, [[would a reversal of the melting of
Arctic sea ice lead to a reduction in Russia's ]{.underline}military
investments]{.mark}[? Would we see fewer ]{.underline}military
exercises in the North Atlantic and/or North Pacific? Would China
be less eager to invest in LNG facilities? Would the EU be less
interested in developing a role in the region?

The answer to these questions is not an unconditional "no", [but [how we
use climate change and particularly ice melting as a]{.mark} contextual
or causal [factor is often not made clear]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
I]{.mark}n many instances, [although climate change is obviously
important in the Arctic, [it is not the primary
driver]{.mark}]{.underline} of many of the geopolitical tensions we see
emerging.
