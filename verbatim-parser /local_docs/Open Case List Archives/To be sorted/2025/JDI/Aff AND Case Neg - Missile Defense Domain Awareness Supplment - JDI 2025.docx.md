Missile Defeat in the Arctic: Breaking Old Paradigms How and why is the
U.S. approach to deterring air and cruise missile threats in the Arctic
changing, and what are the risks and benefits of that approach[?
[Protecting]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} homeland remains the number one
strategic objective]{.underline} outlined in the 2022 National Defense
Strategy [and [requires]{.mark} bolstering [deterrence against]{.mark}
air and cruise [missile threats in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
in recent years, [a consensus has emerged]{.underline} in the U.S.
government that [the legacy approach to missile [defense is too
reactive]{.mark}]{.underline}. What [is needed is a more comprehensive
missile defeat approach, [focus]{.mark}ed **[on]{.mark} getting
[info]{.mark}rmation** to decisionmakers]{.underline}--- ideally before
a missile attack is launched---to expand options beyond kinetic missile
kills. As part of this broader missile defeat strategy, NORAD/[[NORTHCOM
has made "domain awareness"]{.mark} and "information dominance" [top
prioriti]{.mark}es]{.underline}. This shift must be matched by
improvements in the command's capabilities, which are still very limited
in both these areas.

#### The Arctic is most susceptible to attacks from adversaries, domain awareness is key

Because of historically limited interest and investment in cruise
missile defense concepts and technologies, [the [U.S. military]{.mark}
now [has]{.mark} very [little capability to detect]{.mark}, track,
identify or intercept cruise [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} and other
aerial strikes on the U.S. homeland.58 To overcome this inertia,
NORAD/NORTHCOM has embraced a new paradigm that emphasizes domain
awareness and information dominance as the foundation of its missile
defeat approach.59 The argument is that [early [detection]{.mark} of a
potential threat [can open up decision]{.mark} space [for U.S.
leaders]{.mark} [so]{.mark} [they can make moves]{.mark} left of launch
or even left of conflict [to reduce the risk]{.mark} of an attack in the
first place]{.underline}. As Gen VanHerck has said, "If I'm shooting
down cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, we've failed in deterrence
and that's not where we want to be."60 [**[Domain awareness]{.mark} and
information dominance are also [prerequisite]{.mark}s for any actions
[to defeat missiles]{.mark}** right of launch:]{.underline} after
kinetic or non-kinetic attacks have occurred. Short-range point defenses
surrounding a particular location and longer-range area defenses are
important for selected homeland military and civilian infrastructure
because they can further bolster deterrence and protect U.S. power
projection capability. But an over-emphasis on the "counter" element in
the detect-track-counter kill chain is not a recipe for success due to
the escalatory risks relative to stopping or preventing attacks in the
first place. Another consideration is the technical difficulty and
expense associated with building a defense system that has the capacity
to even handle the high volume of increasingly sophisticated cruise
missiles that can be launched at the United States, much less launch
counterattacks. [[In]{.mark} a [missile]{.mark} defeat architecture that
favors [domain awareness]{.mark} and information dominance, [the Arctic
plays a central role]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his March 2023 testimony
to Congress, Gen VanHerck paraphrased Billy Mitchell's comments about
[[Alaska being the **most strategic**]{.mark} **location on the
planet**]{.underline} and reminded senators that [**[the Arctic is the
most direct route for]{.mark} missile [attacks]{.mark}** [from Russia,
China, and North Korea]{.mark}. Furthermore, [with sea ice
receding]{.mark}, [China and Russia are]{.mark} increasingly [able to
deploy missile]{.mark}-carrying submarines into the
region.]{.underline}61 However, the new emphasis on domain awareness and
information dominance is not without risks. Gen VanHerck noted in his
testimony that the missile defeat approach, which favors detection over
tracking and countering, is at risk because of a sheer lack of
capabilities in the Arctic.

#### AND domain awareness is key to strengthening deterrence from Russia and China

**\[Megan\-\--Naval warfare reporter @ Defense News, "**NORTHCOM needs
better sensors to protect against Russian submarine, missile threat,"
March 8, 2022, *Defense News*,

"[[Russia is the primary]{.mark} military [threat to the
homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}," he wrote in written testimony ahead of a
March 8 hearing before the committee, adding that "[[Russia has
fielded]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} family of advanced air-, sea-, and
ground-based [cruise missiles]{.mark} to threaten critical civilian and
military infrastructure."]{.underline}

"The AS-23a air-launched cruise missile, for instance, features [an
[extended range]{.mark} that [enables Russian bombers flying]{.mark}
well [outside]{.mark} NORAD [radar coverage]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
in some cases from inside Russian airspace --- to threaten targets
throughout North America. This capability challenges my ability to
detect an attack and mount an effective defense. In the maritime domain,
Russia has fielded the first two of their nine planned
Severodvinsk-class guided missile submarines, which are designed to
deploy undetected within cruise missile range of our coastlines to
threaten critical infrastructure during an escalating crisis. This
challenge will be compounded in the next few years as the Russian Navy
adds the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile to the Severodvinsk's
arsenal," his written testimony continues.

During the hearing, Rep. Joe Courtney, the Democrat from Connecticut who
chairs HASC's seapower and projection forces committee, asked about two
solutions VanHerck mentioned in the written testimony: an Integrated
Undersea Surveillance System and an Over-the-Horizon Radar system.

Courtney said the Severodvinsk submarines, also called Yasen-class
attack subs, are typically thought of as a U.S. European Command
problem, not a NORTHCOM one, and he wanted to know what those two sensor
systems would mean for homeland defense and if they could be set up
quickly.

VanHerck said modernizing and expanding the Integrated Undersea
Surveillance System would be a collaboration between the U.S. Navy and
partners such as Canada to "track and maintain awareness of submarine
positions around the globe. \[[It's\] a very challenging environment in
the central Atlantic, when they get on the mid-Atlantic ridge, to be
able [to track them]{.mark} --- so to be able to hold them accountable,
if you will, [before they become a threat is
important]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The general elaborated in his written remarks that **[[the ability to
see the adversary is,]{.mark} itself, [a form of
deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"I [need [improved domain awareness]{.mark} to [increase warning
time]{.mark}]{.underline} and provide leaders at all levels with as many
options as possible to deter or defend against an attack. [Global
all-[domain awareness will generate]{.mark} a significant [deterrent
effect]{.mark} by making it clear that [we can see]{.mark} potential
[aggressors wherever they are, which]{.mark} inherently [casts doubt on
their]{.mark} ability to achieve their
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" he wrote.

VanHerck told Courtney that NORTHCOM would continue to work with EUCOM
on the undersea surveillance system, and that it would also need to be
fielded in the Pacific as well. He expressed confidence that the fiscal
2023 budget request would show support for this initiative.

On the Over-the-Horizon Radar system, VanHerck said this system would
look out about 4,000 miles in the maritime, air and space domains.
Traditional radar systems are limited by the curvature of Earth, and
this new system would give significantly better early warning capability
compared to existing systems.

"OTHR is a proven technology that will provide persistent surveillance
of the distant northern approaches to the United States and mitigate the
limitations of the Cold War-era North Warning System, while contributing
to broader domain awareness challenges including space domain awareness.
The ability to detect air-breathing and spaceborne threats in the
approaches to Canada and the United States will be significantly
enhanced by fielding OTHR as soon as possible," he wrote in his
testimony.

VanHerck said the radar is "something we can move out on relatively
quickly, as well as undersea surveillance," given that the technology
already exists and is in use by other nations.

The general made clear in his written testimony, though, that the quick
fielding of these two systems is just a first step in protecting the
homeland from increasingly sophisticated Russian submarine threats.

"[[Russia has the capability]{.mark} today [to hold targets]{.mark} in
the United States and Canada [at risk]{.mark}]{.underline} with
long-range air- and submarine-launched conventional cruise missiles.
[[These]{.mark} highly precise and stealthy [systems highlight the need
for policy]{.mark} determinations [regarding]{.mark} [what must be
defended]{.mark}]{.underline} along with continued demonstrations of
resiliency and hardening," he wrote.

In addition to fielding the sensor systems and sharing the collected
data globally, to "successfully deter aggression and defend the
homeland, [[we must be able to detect]{.mark} and track the submarines,
aircraft, and surface [ships that carry]{.mark} weapons [systems capable
of striking]{.mark} the homeland [before]{.mark} [they depart]{.mark}
from their home stations]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We also need to improve
our capability to defeat those launch platforms before they are within
range of their targets."

So, info sharing really applies to global integration. And I'd really
hit upon that to working with our, all our allies to ensure that we have
the enhanced [[domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} across our allies
that we are gathering their information as well to really build that
picture out. And what does that picture create? That [[creates
info]{.mark}rmation [advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} When
everything's not siloed and we have, we've brought it all together in
global integration. We now have information advantage to really
understand what that \[00:25:00\] left of launch is. If we're doing it
in silos, we're unable to gather to bring all that information together
to amalgamate it all and really see what the picture is. And working
with our allies and inter agencies, really enables that to occur. So,
that is a big piece of information sharing that we've really taken on
board at NORAD right now and will be in the future as well to build that
enhanced domain awareness to ensure that we have information advantage
as we move into the future. Another piece of Pied hit upon it. So detect
and defend. We've now transferred to deter, detect, defend, and defeat.
And that is huge coming from a, coming from NORAD and US NORTHCOM as
well to make that transition. As Pied mentioned, we've been using
satellites and early warning radars really to do that detection piece.
And now we've incorporated all of that into deter first. [How do we
deter? How do we get left of launching? That is huge. And that's what
we're trying to achieve with that \[00:26:00\] enhanced domain
awareness, which leads to information advantage]{.underline}. Heather
"Lucky" Penney: No, I'm really glad you mentioned that, James, because
[the [deterrence]{.mark} piece getting left of launch really does
[require]{.mark} that integrated sensing that integrated [domain
awareness]{.mark}.]{.underline} And if we're doing that amongst partners
across different phenomenology, so different means, methods, and so
forth, as Pied mentioned, that, really kind of avoids a circular
reporting that can ensure that we are cross checking the information and
intelligence that we're getting so that we have the right data. So, [as
we're observing what, for example, Russia and China are doing in the
Arctic]{.underline}, what are your thoughts on their civil and military
Arctic activities? I'm really curious because they rarely make the news,
but obviously you're tracking this very closely, although we haven't
completed the NORAD modernization program, you're moving in that
direction. So, could you provide us an assessment of what you're seeing
and what your worry beads are right now regarding Russia and China?
Brig. Gen. James Hawthorne: Sure, I'll just make a quick comment from a
Canadian perspective. So we've seen increased Russian \[00:27:00\] air
activity. Obviously, we've seen that within NORAD and within Canada as
too, as they impede upon the ADIZ. [[We've]{.mark} also [seen]{.mark}
**increased [Chinese vessels]{.mark} up [in the Arctic]{.mark}** and
surveillance platforms mapping and [collecting data]{.mark}. Just with
with all that [climate change]{.mark}, it's [made the Arctic **more
accessible**]{.mark} **to everyone**]{.underline}. And [we've got to
ensure that we have the capabilities to assert sovereignty and detect
and protect our national interests]{.underline}. Without those, and
[[with]{.mark} the increased [presence of China and Russia]{.mark}
impeding upon the Arctic]{.underline}, being more involved in the
Arctic, if we don't have, [[if we don't protect]{.mark} that
[sovereignty]{.mark}, assert that sovereignty, **[we're going to have
difficulties]{.mark} as we move into the future [to ensure]{.mark} that
we have [democracy]{.mark}** and true rule of law.]{.underline} Heather
"Lucky" Penney: So, I'm curious, given, you know, we're seeing Russia
begin to expand its Arctic presence on its own territories. We
previously saw China building up brand new islands and territory in the
South China Sea on those coral reefs, right? So, they're trying to
expand their \[00:28:00\] territory. through building up and
establishing, basing on coral reefs down the South China Sea. Are we
seeing anything similar in the Arctic region? Because I remember when
China first began to go up there, we're like, wow, where, where did they
get this interest? Clearly it's because of the resources and the
potential for economic advantage, as well as strategic posturing. Is
anyone planting their flag up there? Maj. Gen. Mark "Pied" Piper: So
I'll say from historically looking at China specifically.
[[China,]{.mark} just based on the scope and scale of who they are as a
nation, they are always [interested in everything]{.mark}, everywhere,
all the time.]{.underline} So, there's nothing they're not paying
attention to. Whether or not they take action on that and when they take
action on that is a different question. So, from the standpoint of are
we seeing activity and planting the flag both figuratively and literally
in the Arctic in the way that they're doing in the South China Sea, the
answer is no. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lot of
interest from them. [And the other thing that [we know]{.mark} from
[China]{.mark} is their [ability to mobilize]{.mark} and go from zero to
60 in \[00:29:00\] like 2.2 seconds]{.underline} when they put their
mind to something is pretty staggering. And so [that's why **[we]{.mark}
continually [need]{.mark} [to]{.mark} be [monitor]{.mark}ing [what
they're doing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} So, they definitely have increased
interest. Uh, as an example, [back in July, that was the first time that
[we saw China operating]{.mark} their H-6 [bombers in the
Arctic]{.mark}, and not only was the first time that we saw the H-6
operating in the Arctic from China, it's also the first time [we
saw]{.mark} [them]{.mark} **operating [in cooperation with Russia in the
Arctic]{.mark}.** So, that's just multiple signs that show that [China
wants to increase their presence in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
what their long term plans are, what their long term prioritizations
are, what their long term interests are. We have some guesses, but time
will tell. But it is absolutely nothing that we can kind of just assume
that it's just a passing fad for them. We make the assumption that China
is going to be just like Russia. [[It is]{.mark} going to be a
[enduring]{.mark} interest and presence, and [competition in the
Arctic]{.mark} environment [from China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Heather
"Lucky" Penney: I \[00:30:00\] totally agree with you. So, Pied, from
your warfighter background, you know, you've got pointy noses, you flew
fighters and all of that, I'm curious how you take off your NORAD, cap
and then put on your flight cap, if you will, regarding a warfighter
perspective operating within the region.

#### Changes in the arctic result in shifting strategies now; the US needs to increase domain awareness to adapt

**Pechko 25**, graduate from Seton Hall University\'s School of
Diplomacy & International Relations and staff writer at the Arctic
Institute (Kiel Pechko, 1-7-2025, \"Rising Tensions and Shifting
Strategies: The Evolving Dynamics of US Grand Strategy in the Arctic\",

NAE

The Arctic, often associated with serene landscapes and wildlife, is not
just a picturesque region but a strategically important area shaped by
environmental, political, economic, and military forces. During the Cold
War, it was a battleground between the United States (US), the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve it as
a zone of cooperation.1) However, the strategic competition among the
US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) has significantly
elevated its geopolitical importance in the past decade. The military
advancements of Russia and PRC, in contrast to slower efforts by the US
and NATO, have turned the Arctic into a critical focus for security,
resource access, and control over emerging shipping routes. In 2009,
global interest in the Arctic surged when the US Geological Survey
estimated the Arctic held 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and
30 percent of the world's natural gas.2) That same year, the US hosted
the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm cooperation. When
Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, the tone shifted from
collaboration to competition. Russia's tenor was not unprecedented; in
2007, Russian submarines planted a Russian flag on the North Pole,
proclaiming, "The Arctic is Russian."3) The 2013 launch of the US
National Strategy for the Arctic Region set the stage for today's
geopolitical landscape. By 2022, Russian militarism and PRC's 'Polar
Silk Road' ambitions prompted the US to update its Arctic strategy,
emphasizing military readiness, infrastructure, and NATO
collaboration.4) The Biden administration further prioritized
investments in icebreakers, climate action, and Indigenous involvement,
striking a delicate balance between national security and sustainable
development in this increasingly contested region.5) Background Since
2009, the US has issued several Arctic policy documents. The 2009 Arctic
Region Policy Directive marked a significant shift in US assessment by
recognizing the Arctic's importance, particularly in terms of energy and
security.6) The 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region highlighted
energy and US security, environmental preservation, freedom of
navigation, access to resources, commerce protection, and peaceful
resolution.7) The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was more
urgent. Marie-Anne Coninsx, a senior fellow at the Egmont Institute and
former EU Ambassador (Arctic), noted that in prior years, US Arctic
commitment was "not high on the US Federal Agenda."8) The Strategy
marked a shift in US policy, acknowledging the Arctic as a critical and
addressing challenges that had emerged since 2013. It identified four
key Pillars: security, climate change/protection, sustainable
development, and international governance.9) The strategy emphasized
climate change and investing in sustainable development while increasing
capabilities to prevent threats to the US and its allies.10)
Furthermore, it recognized the heightened strategic competition in the
Arctic, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.11) In 2023, US Army
General VanHerck advocated to Congress the urgent need for a focused
Arctic Strategy, enhanced domain awareness, and the creation of a
comprehensive defense framework as these challenges were being driven
further by advancing climate change and rising security challenges.12)
The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition and directs the DoD to
"enhance its Arctic capabilities, deepen engagement with Allies and
partners, and exercise our forces to build readiness for operations at
high latitudes."13) It highlights critical defense objectives, including
protecting US sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the
Arctic's role as a secure avenue for power projection. The 2024 Strategy
includes specific initiatives such as enhanced domain awareness;
increased communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities; better understanding of cold-weather operations; and
conducting key routine training alongside US allies to strengthen joint
capabilities.14) The strategy emphasizes cooperation with, and
participation of, Arctic nations and Indigenous communities. It
underscores climate adaptation measures. Through these efforts, the DoD
seeks to maintain a "monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic
remains peaceful while adapting to dynamic environmental and security
conditions. Climate change and security [[Climate change has **rapidly**
transformed the Arctic, making]{.underline}]{.mark} previously
inaccessible [[areas]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[available for economic
and strategic use]{.mark}. [The North Sea Route (NSR) and the Northwest
Passage (NWP) could become economically viable]{.mark} by
2023,15)]{.underline} potentially [[diverting traffic from the Suez
Canal]{.mark}.]{.underline} As access to critical resources expands,
[[states will shift strategies and intensify competition over the
Arctic's growing economic and military
significance]{.mark}.]{.underline} This competition has also been driven
by its militarization.16) Over the past decade, Russia has modernized
its Arctic military bases, deployed defense missiles, and upgraded its
submarine fleet while developing fisheries, petroleum, and mineral
extraction.17) Russia's restrictive NSR claims have further escalated
tensions, especially following its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, PRC
signaled growing ambitions having ramped up its Arctic investments,
researched military applications, and expanded its icebreaker fleet.18)
These developments highlight the Arctic's evolving role in economic
opportunity and strategic rivalry, posing significant challenges to US
grand strategy. American Grand Strategy The 2009 Arctic Region Policy
shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold War US Arctic strategy,
[recognizing the Arctic as an emerging critical region but only
identified two focal points: energy and security]{.underline}.19) [The
2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was
comprehensive]{.underline}, [addressing the Pillars of security, climate
change/environmental protection, sustainable development, and
international governance. [Changes in the physical, financial, and
geopolitical landscape have shifted]{.mark}]{.underline} American grand
strategy in [[the Arctic, ending]{.underline}]{.mark} the previous
[[three decades of stability]{.underline}]{.mark} following the Cold War
[[and reflecting rising]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitical [[tensions
between Russia and Arctic stakeholders]{.mark}.]{.underline} Energy
[[The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural gas, with Alaska's
Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being North America's most
prominent;]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 2000s, [[Prudhoe
Bay]{.underline}]{.mark} typically [[produced]{.underline}]{.mark} about
[[8% of America's domestic oil.]{.mark}20) The importance of Arctic oil
to America's energy independence was demonstrated in 2006 when a leak in
a critical pipeline at Prudhoe Bay forced the line's shutdown while the
US and Iran were in a dispute. At the same time, tensions in the Middle
East made it difficult for the US to buy reasonably priced foreign
oil]{.underline}. The total cost of oil increased 3% domestically.21)
The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, it was also met with resistance from
environmentalists, thus hindering implementation.22) This debate
persisted over the years, shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic
resource development. [The Trump administration (2021) issued drilling
leases on more than 400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge]{.underline}.23) In contrast, the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic acknowledges the region's economic reliance on hydrocarbon
production while advocating for economic diversification, a transition
to green energy and environmental protection.24) In 2024, the US
Department of the Interior denied commercial access to a copper deposit
through Gates of the Arctic National Park. It banned oil drilling in
half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.25) Environmentalists and
tribal leaders praised these decisions, but Alaska's officials
criticized them.26) The relationship between environmentalism and energy
complicates the US grand strategy in the Arctic, creating inconsistency
due to fluctuating politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support.
This makes long-term planning for Arctic energy difficult, as leadership
changes can shift priorities between resource extraction and
environmental protections and alter the trajectory of US Arctic
strategy. Such volatility hampers coherent, long-term policies essential
for the region's energy security and ecological sustainability, making
it a contentious issue influenced by electoral outcomes and shifting
public opinion. Security The 2009 US Arctic Region Policy's focus on
security has evolved significantly. Previously, the US emphasized
unilateral security and preferred bilateral agreements to regional
cooperation while ignoring Arctic issues.27) Post-Cold War, Russia
expanded its presence in the Arctic, reverting to Cold War norms. In
response, [the 2022 National Strategy now prioritizes American people
and sovereign territory and rights, committing to enhance capabilities
through infrastructure improvements, including an expanded icebreaker
fleet, and strengthening cooperation with Arctic allies against Russian
aggression]{.underline}.28) In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail
Gorbachev described the Arctic as a "peace and cooperation zone,"
emphasizing collaboration over competition.29) However during the 2000s,
[in response to an increased perception of NATO's Arctic presence and
strategic importance, Russia began militarizing the region, seeking to
reclaim its superpower status after the Soviet Union's
collapse]{.underline}.30) [[By 2019, Russia had established 14
airfields, six military bases, refurbished 16 Soviet-era deep-water
ports, and 10 border posts in the Arctic, with its Northern Fleet
boasting an estimated 120 ships, including 40
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}.31) Russia allowed PRC to construct
docks at five of the most significant ports along Russia's Arctic
coastline.32) In contrast, the US needs to develop a centralized command
structure in the Arctic, a crucial aspect of its security policy.33) It
has only one significant base at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, with
two additional bases south of the Arctic Circle in Alaska.34) The US has
only two ocean-going icebreakers. There is a stark disparity in military
presence between Russia and the US, a potential security dilemma.
Russia's action, and the US's inaction, underscore the Arctic's
strategic importance and the urgency for a comprehensive security
strategy. [Russia has fortified the region to protect future strategic
and economic interests]{.underline}.35) [The US has interpreted this as
an attempt to achieve regional dominance, prompting numerous military
operations in the area.36) Moscow views US actions as aggressive
intrusions into Russian territory, which has led to further
militarization on both sides]{.underline}.37) This ongoing dynamic was
exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed that his fleet was
prepared to secure sea lanes in the Atlantic and Arctic.38) A Russian
Duma member responded by stating that the US should not tempt fate and
that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's responsibility where Russian
national interests are present.39) The current US Grand Strategy has
acted firmly but lacks consistent messaging. For example, in 2019,
Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression in the Arctic,
citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification, and
actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) The US
must ensure that its actions in the Arctic are firm, predictable,
consistent, and straightforward to avoid further escalating tensions.
The US must improve its messaging on Arctic security by clearly
communicating its policies and red lines to Russia to avoid
misinterpretations and unintended confrontations. However, it's also
important to recognize that the Arctic offers opportunities for
cooperation. Enhanced communication can address immediate threats and
foster stable regional collaboration. By improving its messaging
strategy, the US can more effectively navigate the complex geopolitical
landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with Russia.
Economics The future of the American Grand Strategy will be influenced
by accessibility of the NSR and NWP, which has historically been limited
due to short operational seasons (sea ice, weather) and limited
infrastructure. These routes are, however, becoming viable with the
NSR's navigation season expected to extend from three to six months and
the NWP's from two to four months by 2100.42) If these projections hold,
transporting goods from Europe to the Far East via the NSR could be 25
percent more profitable than the Suez Canal Route.43) The current
shipping industry is already challenged. In 2023, Houthi attacks in the
Red Sea led seven major shipping companies to alter their routes,
resulting in fewer ships using the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, severe drought
in Panama caused a 30 percent decrease in trade since November 2023.44)
These disruptions have led to a 283 percent increase in the cost of a
40-foot container transiting from PRC to northern Europe.45) These
challenges have highlighted the need for alternative shipping routes,
making the Arctic routes increasingly important. [[The future
accessibility of the Arctic makes it more critical than
ever]{.underline}]{.mark} however[[, the West's investment is
lagging.46)]{.underline}]{.mark} In contrast[[, Russia has prioritized
the development of the Arctic to attract traffic,]{.underline}]{.mark}
particularly the NSR[. From 2011 to 2015, the Russian Arctic doctrine
focused on establishing new ports, customs facilities, and marine
checkpoints along the Arctic Coastline.47) Vladimir [Putin has stressed
the NSR's strategic importance, and Russia's
]{.mark}]{.underline}development [[plan]{.underline}]{.mark} for 2035
[[includes \$19 billion in]{.underline}]{.mark} infrastructure
[[investments]{.mark}.48) These commitments underscore Russia's
recognition of the value of the NSR and the potential increase in cargo
transport in the north. [The development of the NSR
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[of interest to PRC, who referred to it as
part of the Polar Silk Road]{.mark} in its 2018 Arctic White Paper and
the 14th Five-Year Plan]{.underline}.49) Putin's 2023 visit to PRC aimed
to enhance the NSR's integration into the Belt and Road Initiative.50)
PRC's NSR use has steadily increased, with transits rising from 27 in
2018 to 62 in 2020.51) [The economic benefits, predicted to be 25 %
greater than those of the Suez Canal Route, are also a significant
driver of PRC's growing NSR interest.52) PRC stands to gain
significantly from Russian NSR, and Arctic expansion, in
general]{.underline}. In contrast, Europe and Japan have a more
complicated view of the NSR. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
there was a decline in NSR transit due to sanctions on Russia.53)
However, by 2023, transits had rebounded, with increased transport of
Russian LNG to Europe.54) Despite condemning Russia's actions, Japan has
not avoided the NSR, indicating that economic advantages often outweigh
political considerations. Shifting maritime traffic from the Suez Canal
to the NSR requires the US to reevaluate trade routes and competitive
strategies. As European and Asian partners increasingly use the NSR,
they will need to maintain good relations with Russia, which could limit
their willingness to oppose Russia, giving Russia a strategic advantage.
The US must consider this shift in geopolitical power while also closely
monitoring the growing partnership between Russia and the PRC in the
Arctic. [[Increased access to energy and mineral resources extraction

growth]{.underline}]{.mark}.55) **[[The area is home to 22 percent of
the world's resources, which includes up to 25 percent of unexplored oil
and gas reserves]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Despite having no Arctic land,
PRC refers to itself as a "near Arctic state," investing heavily in the
region. In 2012, PRC invested \$12 billion in the Russian Yamal LNG
project after US sanctions left Russia short on funds.56) Furthermore,
in 2018, [PRC signed an agreement to invest in Alaskan natural gas
export facility]{.underline},57) and in 2019, Chinese companies
purchased 10 percent (\$5.6 billion) of the most prominent Russian
natural gas producer.58) PRC has unsuccessfully attempted to buy mines
in Nunavut59) and recently increased research and land acquisition
efforts in the Svalbard.60) [PRC is clearly committed to Arctic
resources]{.underline}. [[The Arctic's growing accessibility is changing

Key Points [[The Arctic is the preeminent staging ground for adversary
missile attacks because it is the most direct route from Moscow or
Beijing to Washington DC]{.mark}, and both Russia and China are
subsequently taking steps to increase their foothold in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The size of the Arctic, and [[the potential for
large, unpredictable missile raids, creates a need for new
"left-of-launch" capabilities, such as increased domain awareness, to
give U.S. leaders more options]{.mark} in a]{.underline} crisis. The
Department of Defense (DOD) should launch a joint capability technology
demonstration to identify promising Arctic missile defeat efforts.
**[[DOD and Congress should establish a North American Defense
Initiative to fund Arctic domain awareness and infrastructure
upgrades.]{.mark} The Air Force should exploit existing weapon systems
including Air National Guard MQ-9 Reapers and accelerate procurement of
new systems to bolster Arctic domain awareness. DOD should continue
collaboration with the commercial space sector to enhance Arctic
communications and reconnaissance. The United States should encourage
allies and partners to develop more missile defeat capabilities by
offering incentives such as partnerships and intelligence
exchanges.]{.underline}** The North American Aerospace Defense Command
([[NORAD]{.underline}]{.mark}), as a combined U.S.-Canada command
charged with aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning
in the defense of North America, [[identifies cruise missile attacks as
a serious threat to the U.S. homeland.1 Russia and China continue to
diversify their arsenals of guided missiles]{.mark}, which can fly at
low altitudes, have unpredictable flight paths, may reach hypersonic
speeds, and be launched from air, sea, or subsurface platforms. [The
Arctic has remained an attractive attack vector for both U.S. and
Russian long-range aviation and missiles since the earliest days of the
Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. The growing Arctic presence of China, a
self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state" possessing an increasingly robust
long-range aviation and missile inventory, reinforces the region's
significance as a staging ground for air and cruise missile attacks. The
U.S. Department of Defense continues to invest billions to defend
against limited ballistic missile attacks, but the U.S. military's
ability to detect, track, and defeat a cruise missile strike emanating
from the Arctic has degraded significantly over the past 30 years. China
or Russia could exploit this shortfall using conventional cruise missile
attacks to deal a quick blow that keeps U.S. military forces at distance
and avoid a nuclear response. [[Bolstering deterrence against
conventional air and cruise missile threats in the Arctic starts by
improving U.S]{.mark}., ally, and partner [domain awareness and
information dominance capabilities]{.mark}. Adversaries will be
disinclined to launch strikes on the U.S. homeland if they know the
United States is anticipating the attack and creating options to
dissuade it. [Achieving better domain awareness involves efforts to
provide indications and warning of attacks through the
detection]{.mark}, tracking, characterization, warning, and attribution
[of modern threats]{.mark}.2 Establishing information dominance enables
U.S. leaders to access decision-quality information more quickly than
adversaries. [Domain awareness and information dominance can underwrite

#### The Arctic is becoming an increasingly important hotspot for US Homeland Defense.

**[Bjørkum 21]{.underline}**, Schriever Space Scholar and Lt. in Royal

Since the US bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, it has been an Arctic
nation and is currently one of the Arctic Five and a member of the
Arctic Council.31 In Alaska, permafrost dominates the northern third of
the state, making regular settlements challenging.32 Less than 68,000
Americans live in the Arctic, and Alaska produces only 0.3 percent of
the US GNP.33 Mineral production in Alaska constitutes about four
percent of US min- eral production.34 Nevertheless, [the [Arctic is
**vital to US geostrategic in- terests**]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 As
[[the Arctic as a "geostrategic buffer is eroding" and strategic
competition]{.mark} in the area [is increasing,]{.mark} [the **US
needs**]{.mark} **a comprehensive US [military strategy]{.mark}** [for
the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}36 The DOD's 2019 Arctic strategy
expands on the complex security en- vironment in the region. It
recognizes the security threat emerging from increasing access to
resources, an uncertain strategic environment, and the fragile but still
enduring cooperation in the region.37 The DOD estab- lished three main
objectives for the Arctic: [defend the homeland, compete when necessary
to maintain favorable regional balances of power, and ensure common
domains remain free and open.]{.underline}38 The [[DOD acknowl- edges
the Arctic as a]{.mark}n **increasingly [vital region]{.mark}** [due
to]{.mark} strategic competi- tion]{.underline} and greater access to
the region and its resources. This focus gives the Air and Space Forces
a direction for an Arctic strategy. The Department of the Air Force
views the Arctic as "[[residing at the **intersection between the U.S.
homeland and two** ]{.mark}**critical [theaters]{.mark},** Indo- Pacific
and Europe, \[thus making\] the Arctic . . . an increasingly vital re-
gion for U.S. national security interests]{.underline}."39 The Air
Force's Arctic Strategy also recognizes the "Arctic as a region of
strategic opportunity for the Air and Space Forces, Joint Force, allies,
and partners."40 The strategy builds around four lines of effort:
[[maintaining vigilance through]{.mark} command, con- trol,
communications, intelligence, [surveillance, and reconnaissance]{.mark}
(C3ISR); projecting power through bases in Alaska and
Greenland;]{.underline} co- operating with allies and Arctic partners;
and finally, preparing through training, research, and development.41
Allied and partner cooperation is emphasized throughout the strategy.
The strategy recognizes space as a solution for the challenges in the
demanding Arctic operating environ- ment. The Space Force must overcome
the region's unique orbital and electro-magnetic obstacles that
negatively affect all communication and navigational signals.

#### Arctic domain awareness is key now, Russia and China encroachment proves

The Defense Department today released its [2024 Arctic
Strategy](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jul/22/2003507411/-1/-1/0/DOD-ARCTIC-STRATEGY-2024.PDF).
The strategy acknowledges how environmental changes are affecting the
Arctic region, details the implications for U.S. security and spells out
how the department plans to be ready to meet new challenges there.
\"[[The Arctic region]{.mark} of the United States [is critical to the
defense of our homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}, the protection of U.S.
national sovereignty and the preservation of our defense treaty
commitments,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said today during
a briefing at the Pentagon. \"[Our Arctic strategy will guide the
department\'s efforts to ensure that the Arctic remains a secure and
stable region.\" Eight nations have a presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}, including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, [the United States and Russia]{.underline}. [All have
interests there for both commerce and security]{.underline}. [Climate
changes have meant the melting of ice in the Arctic and the opening of
new sea routes]{.underline}, [which means new opportunities for commerce
and resource exploitation]{.underline}, but also increased risk to
nations whose borders were previously protected by the region\'s
inaccessibility. \"[[C]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange [is]{.mark}
fundamentally [altering the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
with it]{.underline}, [geopolitics and [U]{.mark}]{.underline}[.S.
defense]{.mark} missions,\" Hicks said. \"[The readiness of our forces
for those missions is always foremost on our minds]{.underline}, [and
[that\'s why]{.mark} for decades]{.underline}, [across Republican and
Democratic administrations]{.underline}, the [department has been
seeking to ensure our military capabilities can meet the
mark]{.underline}, even in the face of a changing climate.\" Climate
change and the shifts in the operating environment, Hicks said, mean
[the U.S. [must rethink how to protect warfighters and prevent
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The P]{.mark}eople\'s [R]{.mark}epublic
of [C]{.mark}hina]{.underline}, [not an Arctic nation]{.underline}, [[is
increasing its presence in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [PRC
operates three icebreakers]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}, for
instance, [[and has a military presence]{.mark} there as
well]{.underline}. The Chinese military has also demonstrated its
ability to operate in the Arctic by conducting operations with the
Russian navy, for instance. \"[While not an Arctic state]{.underline},
the PRC seeks greater influence in the region, greater access to the
region, [and a greater say in its governance,\" Hicks said]{.underline}.
\"[That\'s concerning given that it\'s the only strategic competitor
with the will and increasingly the wherewithal to remake the
international order.\" Russia\'s presence in the Arctic]{.underline},
including its military presence --- the largest of all Arctic nations
--- can hold U.S. [and allied territories at risk]{.underline}. At the
same time, [Russia is increasing its presence in the Arctic by reopening
Soviet-era military installations]{.underline}. \"[[Russia continues to
pose a]{.mark}n acute [threat to security and stability]{.mark} in the
region,\" Hicks said]{.underline}. [\"[Russia has continued to build up
its military infrastructure in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.mark} assert excessive claims over Arctic waters.\" Russia [is
also partnering with China]{.mark}]{.underline}, Hicks said, [and this
presents additional concerns for U]{.underline}.S. defense. \"[[We\'ve
seen growing cooperation]{.mark} between the PRC and Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline}, commercially, [[with]{.mark} [the PRC being a major
funder of Russian energy exploitation in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and increasingly
militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}, [with Russia and China conducting joint
exercises off the coast of Alaska,\" Hicks said]{.underline}. \"All of
these challenges have been amplified because the effects of climate
change are rapidly warming temperatures and thinning ice coverage, [and
it\'s enabling all of this activity.\" The DOD\'s 2024 Arctic Strategy
addresses these concerns in the Arctic with three lines of
effort]{.underline}, including enhancing the capabilities of the joint
force, [greater engagement with allies and partners and exercising
U]{.underline}.S. [presence in the Arctic]{.underline}. \"[[Our Arctic
strategy]{.mark} adopts a \'monitor and respond]{.underline},\' approach
in the region,\" Hicks said. \"[It [is underpinned by]{.mark} robust
[domain awareness and intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [surveillance
and reconnaissance capabilities]{.underline}, [cooperation with our
allies and partners and deterrent power enabled by the agility of the
joint force]{.underline}. [The strategy focuses on enhancing our domain
awareness and Arctic capabilities]{.underline}, [engaging with our
allies and partners and exercising calibrated presence in the
region.\"]{.underline} Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of
defense for arctic and global resilience, said mission enhancement
includes, among other things, [a focus on domain awareness in the
Arctic]{.underline}. \"We must improve our domain awareness and enhance
our ability to detect and respond with our Canadian allies to threats to
the homeland,\" Ferguson said. \"A key focus for my office is
championing investments that will enhance our awareness of threats in
the region. We want to make sure that we have the right sensing
architecture and the right communications architecture for command and
control.\" Also, a target for operational enhancements in the Arctic are
[enhancements to communications and data architecture]{.underline};
intelligence, [surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities]{.underline}; infrastructure; [and cold weather equipment
and mobility]{.underline}.

Incidentally, [[what makes the Great Circle Route good for

previously noted, this route [**[shortens the distance]{.mark}** between

because the reduced distance saves time and money, the same principle of
distance holds true for ballistic missiles. Potential

[[Harnessing benefits from tech]{.mark}nological development [is]{.mark}
particularly [important given the ongoing geopolitical changes in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Growing tension between NATO and Russia is
likely to lead to increased naval activity in the High North, where
vulnerable military, communications, and energy infrastructure is at
risk of sabotage and interference. While China is unlikely to establish
a significant presence in the Arctic, [[monitoring Chinese]{.mark}
maritime [traffic and]{.mark} their potential activities in building
C4ISR ground infrastructure remains important]{.underline}.8 [Monitoring
[Russian]{.mark} activity around its [nuclear deterrent posture has been
of]{.mark} [particular consequence since the beginning of the war in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}---in September 2024, Russian president
Vladimir Putin announced changes to [Russia's nuclear doctrine involving
an "expansion" of its mission]{.underline}, although any substantial
differences are yet to be revealed.9

The White House has already identified C4ISR capabilities as essential
to its Arctic ambitions. Reflecting its "monitor-and-respond" global
posture as outlined in its National Defense Strategy, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates asserts a general readiness to respond
to threats in the Arctic]{.underline} along with its regional allies,
yet [highlights]{.mark} two focal points: [the Arctic (1)]{.underline}
[houses **[various early-warning and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities,]{.mark}**]{.underline} and (2) acts
as the U.S. northern flank in carrying out Indo-Pacific operations.10 In
the strategy's implementation plan, the first strategic objective is
improving the understanding of the Arctic operating environment,
particularly emphasizing the bolstering of space capabilities and
maritime domain awareness.11

[[The strategic utility of an Arctic presence is considerable for
**early warning purposes**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Its [geographical
location makes the Arctic an important]{.underline}]{.mark} [vantage
[point for monitoring potential ballistic missile
launches]{.mark}]{.underline} and other airborne threats.12 [Russia and
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates---with its allies---[depend
on]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} infrastructure [for]{.mark} their [early
warning systems]{.mark}, both [through ground-based
radars]{.mark}]{.underline} and ground stations for satellite
communications (SATCOM). Russia and China are increasingly collaborating
in developing defense technology, decidedly prioritizing space and new
technologies, and it is with Russia's cooperation that China is seeking
to develop and deploy its own early warning infrastructure.13

Yet [[the U.S. ability to detect]{.mark}, track, attribute, and counter
[attacks]{.mark} coming [from the north has]{.mark} significantly
[diminished since the]{.mark} end of the [Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline},
even as America's potential adversaries have prioritized development of
missiles of all types over the same three decades. [[China and Russia
have]{.underline}
[ex](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/weapons-platforms/f-15ex/)[plored
options]{.underline}]{.mark} [to employ long-range, conventional weapons
[to deter U.S.]{.mark} leaders without provoking a nuclear
response]{.underline}. [[Chinese doctrine describes precision strikes as
a means of "war control"]{.mark} to manage escalation and frame
power-projection nodes]{.underline}. [[Missile warfare is becoming a
premier means for Russia to project power]{.underline}]{.mark}; in
Ukraine, Russia has launched hundreds of ballistic and cruise missiles,
as well as suicide drones, targeting power grids and other critical
infrastructure in an attempt to force Kyiv into a settlement. As the
2022 Missile Defense Review noted, [[missile threats to the U.S.
homeland have "rapidly expanded in quantity, diversity, and
sophistication]{.mark}."]{.underline} Modern conventional cruise
missiles pose the greatest threat; they are harder to detect, track,
target, and intercept than ballistic missiles. [[Adversaries have begun
to favor cruise missile development]{.mark} over ballistic missiles
[because they greatly complicate detection]{.mark} and early
warning.]{.underline} This is part of a broader missile development
trend that favors increasingly maneuverable designs. Hypersonic cruise
missiles, for instance, fly at Mach 5 or faster. While hypersonic
missiles produce a greater heat signature and are less maneuverable,
their extreme speed produces a considerable advantage. [[China's]{.mark}
fractional orbital bombardment system, or ([FOBS]{.mark}), [takes
this]{.mark} capability [to a still more striking
level]{.mark},]{.underline} with a highly maneuverable hypersonic glide
missile that is launched into orbit and then re-enters the earth's
atmosphere on an unpredictable trajectory. To date, [[the U.S. has only
mounted a tepid response to these threats]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Throughout the post-Cold War period of the 1990s and early 2000s, Arctic
defense planning took a backseat to other geopolitical concerns for both
the United States and Russia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991, the Russian economy imploded, and its Northern Fleet and air
assets fell into disrepair. Post-Cold War arms reduction treaties,
combined with a major shift in the U.S. military's focus toward
operations in the Middle East after Sept. 11, 2001, contributed to DOD
reducing its Arctic focus. DOD closed or downsized almost all of its
bases in Alaska and significantly shrank other capabilities for
defending the northern approach to the United States. [[This is
reflected by NORAD's]{.mark} continued [reliance on the]{.mark} aging
[North Warning System]{.mark} (NWS), [a network of]{.mark} 47 long-range
and short-range [radars]{.mark} first fielded in the 1980s and
**[equipped with 1970s]{.mark}-era [tech]{.mark}nology.** **[This system
was only designed to identify]{.mark} approaching [Soviet
bombers]{.mark}** after launch [and]{.mark} flying within radar
range.]{.underline} Today, it **[[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}** provide
early indications and warning of adversary force posture changes in the
Arctic, which could be a prelude to an attack. [**Nor can the NWS
[detect]{.mark} air and [missile threats]{.mark} launched [from inside
Russia]{.mark} or bombers, cruise missiles, drones flying too low** or
too far to be detected by its radar. [As Russia and China
develop]{.mark} stealthier cruise missiles and diversify their cruise
missile launch options to include land-based, surface, and subsurface
platforms, [the gaps in the N]{.mark}orth [W]{.mark}arning
[S]{.mark}ystem's effective radar coverage [will continue to
increase]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yet the US and the Arctic 7 as a whole have a low starting point in
terms of cold weather and ice-strengthened capabilities. Regarding
conventional capabilities, the current environment has shown the need to
increase physical access and presence in the region thanks to
icebreakers. Recognizing that it will not close the "icebreaker gap" on
its own, the US recently unveiled a trilateral partnership with Canada
and Finland called the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE
Pact.[^131^](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/up-north-confronting-arctic-insecurity-implications-for-the-united-states-and-nato/#footnote_130_34880)
The ICE Pact will help build polar icebreakers and other surface assets
in the logic of burden sharing and comparative advantages --- although
it heavily leans on ensuring job security and retaining skills in US
shipyards. [[Another]{.mark} paramount [priority]{.mark} in conventional

of North Warning System upgrades, new over-the-horizon radars will

Risks of the Legacy Approach to U.S. Missile Defense in the Arctic The
legacy air and missile defense paradigm is intuitive for U.S. military
operators who have been trained to use kinetic capabilities to kill
threats including drones and cruise missiles.55 While these capabilities
are important and need to be urgently modernized, an overreliance on
kinetic kill platforms, delivery systems, and weapons alone could lead
to a reactive strategy that limits warfighter options. [[Betting on
successful missile intercepts]{.mark} alone [is]{.mark} a particularly
[risky]{.mark} choice [given the area]{.mark} defense [requirements of
the Arctic]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}, much like the contiguous United
States, [is a vast expanse that requires a comprehensive]{.mark} missile
defeat [approach]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the legacy missile defense
paradigm, there are three essential elements to an air and cruise
missile defense system: sensors, battle management systems, and
shooters. The role of sensors is to detect, track, and identify inbound
air and cruise missile threats; battle management systems coordinate
defensive actions; and shooters, such as fighter aircraft,
surface-to-air missiles, or non-kinetic capabilities like
electromagnetic warfare and high-powered microwave weapons, destroy the
incoming threats.56 Air defense for the contiguous United States is now
provided by a network of ground-based radars---including those in the
North Warning System---and a small number of fighters on air defense
alert at several air bases around the country. These fighters are on
alert status to rapidly respond to and intercept foreign military
aircraft, such as Russian bomber patrols that routinely fly near and
occasionally into U.S. airspace. Air Force fighters also intercept
unidentified aircraft, aircraft that have strayed from planned flight
paths, and aircraft that are not properly communicating with air traffic
control. In practice, the small numbers of fighters and the lack of a
system of sensors that can detect low-flying targets over long ranges
limits the system's effectiveness against modern cruise missiles and
other threats. Air defense systems like the kinds being used in Ukraine
also offer some defense against low-volume missile attacks---systems
such as Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), or the
National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), which is used
to defend the Washington DC national capital region. But these systems
are lowdensity, high-demand assets, may cost more per shot than the
missiles they defend against, and are not effective against many types
of cruise missile and drone threats.57 Benefits & Risks of a New Missile
Defeat Paradigm [[Because of historically limited interest and
investment]{.mark} in cruise missile defense concepts and technologies,
[the U.S. military now has very little capability to detect, track,
identify or intercept]{.mark} cruise [missiles]{.mark} and other aerial
strikes on the U.S. homeland]{.underline}.58 To overcome this inertia,
NORAD/NORTHCOM has embraced a new paradigm that emphasizes domain
awareness and information dominance as the foundation of its missile
defeat approach.59 The argument is that early detection of a potential
threat can open up decision space for U.S. leaders so they can make
moves left of launch or even left of conflict to reduce the risk of an
attack in the first place. As Gen VanHerck has said, "If I'm shooting
down cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, we've failed in deterrence
and that's not where we want to be."60 [[Domain awareness]{.mark} [and
information dominance]{.mark} [are]{.mark} also [prerequisites for any
actions to defeat missiles]{.mark} right of launch: after kinetic or
non-kinetic attacks have occurred.]{.underline} Short-range point
defenses surrounding a particular location and longer-range area
[defenses are important for selected homeland military and civilian
infrastructure because they can further bolster deterrence and protect
U.S. power projection capability]{.underline}. But an over-emphasis on
the "counter" element in the detect-track-counter kill chain is not a
recipe for success due to the escalatory risks relative to stopping or
preventing attacks in the first place. Another consideration is the
technical difficulty and expense associated with building a defense
system that has the capacity to even handle the high volume of
increasingly sophisticated cruise missiles that can be launched at the
United States, much less launch counterattacks. [[In a missile defeat
architecture that favors domain awareness]{.mark} and information
dominance, [the Arctic plays a central role]{.mark}.]{.underline} In his
March 2023 testimony to Congress, Gen VanHerck paraphrased Billy
Mitchell's comments about Alaska being the most strategic location on
the planet and reminded senators that [[the Arctic is the most direct
route for missile attacks from Russia, China, and No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[with sea ice
receding]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[China and Russia are increasingly able
to deploy]{.mark} missile-carrying [sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} [into
the region]{.mark}]{.underline}.61 However, the new emphasis on domain
awareness and information dominance is not without risks. Gen VanHerck
noted in his testimony that the missile defeat approach, which favors
detection over tracking and countering, is at risk because of a sheer
lack of capabilities in the Arctic.

Modernizing these older functions and elements is necessary but
insufficient. An effective binational air and missile defense of North
America requires new capabilities and a new defense design. The North
Warning System North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is a
binational U.S. and Canadian organization responsible for both early
warning and defense against air breathing and ballistic missile threats
to North America, including hypersonic weapons. Born from the need to
sense and respond to Russian air and missile threats during the Cold
War, NORAD's charter expanded in 2006 to include maritime domain
awareness.30 Closely partnered with NORAD is U.S. Northern Command
(USNORTHCOM), the geographic combatant command responsible for leading
the Department of Defense's (DOD) response to maritime and ballistic
missile threats to the United States.31 Together, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Canada operate the N]{.mark}orth [W]{.mark}arning

#### Threats are emerging and the US is reliant on old 1980s tech -- that's uniquely key to preventing missile strikes

Since the dawn of the Cold War, the high north has been seen as an
attractive attack vector for long range strike for one simple reason: it
provides shortest distance between the United States and Eurasia. Today,
the Arctic it is still seen by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China as
an appealing attack vector for their missiles and long-range aviation
assets given both the Arctic's geography and insufficient monitoring by
the United States. The growing Arctic presence of China---a
self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state" and custodian of an increasingly
robust long-range aviation and missile inventory---reinforces the
region's significance as a staging ground for conventional air and
cruise missile attacks. Yet the U.S. ability to detect, track,
attribute, and counter attacks coming from the north has significantly
diminished since the end of the Cold War, even as America's potential
adversaries have prioritized development of missiles of all types over
the same three decades. China and Russia have explored options to employ
long-range, conventional weapons to deter U.S. leaders without provoking
a nuclear response. Chinese doctrine describes precision strikes as a
means of "war control" to manage escalation and frame power-projection
nodes. Missile warfare is becoming a premier means for Russia to project
power; in Ukraine, Russia has launched hundreds of ballistic and cruise
missiles, as well as suicide drones, targeting power grids and other
critical infrastructure in an attempt to force Kyiv into a settlement.
As the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted, missile [[threats to
the]{.mark} U.S. [homeland have]{.mark} "rapidly [expanded in quantity,
diversity, and sophistication]{.mark}." Modern conventional cruise
missiles pose the greatest threat; [they are harder to detect,
track,]{.mark} target, [and intercept]{.mark} than ballistic
missiles]{.underline}. [Adversaries have begun to favor cruise missile
development over ballistic missiles because they [greatly complicate
detection and early warning]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is part of a
broader missile development trend that favors increasingly maneuverable
designs. Hypersonic cruise missiles, for instance, fly at Mach 5 or
faster. While hypersonic missiles produce a greater heat signature and
are less maneuverable, their extreme speed produces a considerable
advantage. China's fractional orbital bombardment system, or (FOBS),
takes this capability to a still more striking level, with a highly
maneuverable hypersonic glide missile that is launched into orbit and
then re-enters the earth's atmosphere on an unpredictable trajectory. To
date, the U.S. has only mounted a tepid response to these threats.
Throughout the post-Cold War period of the 1990s and early 2000s, Arctic
defense planning took a backseat to other geopolitical concerns for both
the United States and Russia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991, the Russian economy imploded, and its Northern Fleet and air
assets fell into disrepair. Post-Cold War arms reduction treaties,
combined with a major shift in the [U.S. military's focus toward
operations in the Middle East after Sept. 11, 2001, contributed to [DOD
reducing its Arctic focus.]{.mark} DOD closed or downsized almost all of
its bases in Alaska and significantly shrank other capabilities for
defending the northern approach to the United States. This is [reflected
by NORAD's continued reliance on the aging]{.mark} North Warning System
([NWS]{.mark}), a network of 47 long-range and short-range radars first
fielded in the 1980s and [equipped with 1970s]{.mark}-era
[technology.]{.mark}]{.underline} This system was only designed to
identify approaching Soviet bombers after launch and flying within radar
range. [Today, [it cannot provide early indications and warning of
adversary force posture changes]{.mark} in the Arctic, which could be a
prelude to an attack. [Nor can the NWS detect air and missile
threats]{.mark} launched from inside Russia or bombers, cruise missiles,
drones flying too low or too far to be detected by its radar. As Russia
and China develop stealthier cruise missiles]{.underline} and diversify
their cruise missile launch options to include land-based, surface, and
subsurface platforms, [[the gaps]{.mark} in the North Warning System's
effective radar coverage [will continue to
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Imagine a solid fence shrinking to a
picket fence," notes Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, head of the North American
Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command. "And n[ow you have
cruise missiles that can get through your capability to
detect.]{.underline}" The legacy U.S. air and missile defense paradigm,
focused as it is on kinetic intercept, remains important and needs to be
urgently modernized, but an overreliance on kinetic kill platforms,
delivery systems, and weapons alone limits warfighter options. A network
of ground-based radars---including those in the North Warning
System---and a small number of fighters on air defense alert at air
bases around the country provide today's air defense of the contiguous
United States. These fighters are on alert status to rapidly respond to
and intercept foreign military aircraft, such as Russian bomber patrols
that routinely fly near and occasionally into U.S. airspace. Air Force
fighters also intercept unidentified aircraft, aircraft that have
strayed from planned flight paths, and aircraft that are not properly
communicating with air traffic control. [The small numbers of fighters
and the lack of a system of sensors that can detect low-flying targets
over long ranges limit the system's effectiveness against modern cruise
missiles and other threats]{.underline}. Air defense systems such as
Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), or the National
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), which is used to defend
the Washington, D.C., National Capital Region, offer some defense
against low-volume missile threats, but these low-density, high-demand
assets are extremely costly; they cost more per shot than the missiles
they defend against, and are ineffective against many types of cruise
missile and drone threats. U.S. defense leaders have gradually adopted a
new emphasis over the last decade on a holistic concept called "missile
defeat." and then than narrowly focusing on kinetic kill options to deny
adversary attacks, missile defeat involves using the entire spectrum of
options to prevent and defeat missile threats, from countering
proliferation to early indications and warning and, of course,
detection, tracking, and intercepting cruise missiles. It also seeks to
integrate defensive, offensive, passive, kinetic, and non-kinetic
capabilities, such as cyber warfare, directed energy, and electronic
attack. [NORAD/NORTHCOM embraces this new emphasis on domain awareness
and information dominance. Early detection of a potential threat can
open up decision space for U.S. leaders, enabling moves left-of-launch
or even left-of-conflict to reduce the risk of an attack]{.underline} in
the first place. As VanHerck notes, "If I'm shooting down cruise
missiles and ballistic missiles, we've failed in deterrence, and that's
not where we want to be." [[Domain awareness and information dominance
likewise remain prerequisites for any actions to defeat missiles]{.mark}
right-of-launch]{.underline}---after kinetic or non-kinetic attacks have
occurred. However, the new emphasis on domain awareness and information
dominance is not without challenges. VanHerck testified to Congress that
[the missile defeat approach, which favors detection over tracking and
countering, is at risk because of a sheer lack of capabilities in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The January 2023 intrusion of a Chinese spy balloon
into U.S. airspace by way of northwest Canada caught the nation
off-guard and highlighted this severe lack of domain awareness in the
Arctic. VanHerck told lawmakers: "We are not organized, trained or
equipped to respond in the Arctic." Another Arctic expert, Ketil Olsen,
formerly Norway's military representative in NATO and the European
Union, who now heads Andoeya Space, a Norwegian state-controlled company
that tests new military and surveillance technologies, called the region
"a dark area on the map." [The [lack of domain awareness prevents the
United States from obtaining]{.mark} the early warning and intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance ([ISR) information necessary to
anticipate and take actions to deter]{.mark} air and cruise [missile
attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2014, Russia's Ministry of Defence created the Northern Fleet Joint
Strategic Command to defend Russia's national interests in the Arctic.94
The basic structure of the Northern Fleet includes the 80th Separate
Motorized Rifle Brigade specifically designed to operate in the Arctic
environment. The brigade's equipment includes special armored vehicles
with wide tracks and self-propelled howitzers, antiaircraft artillery
systems, snowmobiles, Arctic kitchens, bakeries, water supply tanks, and
mobile radio communication systems---all capable of operating in the
Arctic's low temperatures and over its harsh terrain.95 [As of
February]{.underline} 28, [2020, the Northern Fleet also included a new
air defense division formed specifically for the Arctic. Russia views
its airborne capability in the Arctic as a unique advantage]{.underline}
of the Northern Fleet. Housed within the Kola Flotilla, Russian
[Airborne Forces conducted their first mass tactical airborne operation
in 2014]{.underline}, dropping forces and military equipment in the
Arctic. More recently, during a workshop in Severomorsk in April 2021,
minister of defence General [Shoigu remarked that the Northern Fleet was
capable of countering existing threats to Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline}.96 [Shoigu further noted that the Ministry of
Defence "is systematically working to increase the combat capabilities
of the Northern Fleet."97 Since its creation, the Northern Fleet has
gained 23 ships and vessels, including the strategic missile submarine
Yuri Dolgorukiy and multipurpose nuclear submarine
Severodvinsk]{.underline}. The missile destroyer Marshal Ustinov has
been modernized, and [efforts are ongoing to modernize the heavy nuclear
missile destroyer Admiral Nakhimov]{.underline}. [Coastal forces also
received three divisions of coastal missile defense systems Bal and
Bastion]{.underline}. Building the necessary infrastructure for the
Arctic Group has been one of the development priorities for Russia's
armed forces, as has ensuring that all Northern Fleet ships and the
newly formed Arctic Brigade receive the required combat training to
maintain the fleet's combat readiness in the Arctic's severe climate
conditions.98 Russia's Military Activities in the Arctic: Responding to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Threat As noted earlier (in
"Opposition to North Atlantic Treaty Organization Countries in the
Arctic" earlier in this appendix), [Russia views NATO as the primary
national security threat]{.underline} in the Arctic, a perception that
could intensify given Finnish and Swedish efforts to join the alliance.
As a result, much of Russia's military activity in the Arctic has been
in response to this perceived threat. [Countering NATO's reconnaissance
activities has been one priority for Russia]{.underline}. In 2016,
Russia's General Shoigu reported that the Ministry of Defence had
observed an increase in reconnaissance activities between 2006 and 2016
from NATO along Russia's perimeter.99 Specifically, during this time
frame, the number of NATO reconnaissance flights along Russia's borders
increased by almost three times and by almost eight times along Russia's
southwest border, according to the ministry. By comparison, the number
of such flights in the 1990s amounted to 107; in the 2000s, it grew to
298; and, in 2016, it grew to 852. In response, the ministry increased
its fighter aircraft patrol flights by 61 percent to secure Russia's
airspace in the Baltics, the Black Sea, and the Arctic. During 2018,
Tupolev Tu-142 and Ilyushin Il-38 antisubmarine aircraft, as well as
Sukhoi Su-24MR reconnaissance aircraft, conducted more than 100 patrols
in various regions over the Arctic Ocean.100 In 2019, the ministry
announced that the Northern Fleet's naval aviation assets would continue
to patrol the Arctic on a regular basis from all-weather airfields in
the Arctic islands and Russia's mainland. However, the number of sorties
of Russia's patrol aircraft remains well below those recorded during the
Cold War.101 As articulated in our report, a discussion of all-domain
awareness, other capabilities, and various threats can be found in the
appendix that is not available to the public. Aside from patrolling the
skies to defend Russia's airspace above the Arctic, [Russia has engaged
in more-active interference in NATO's activities in the region. During
NATO's Exercise Trident Juncture 2018, Russian units jammed GPS signals
in northern Finland and northern Norway and announced that it would
carry out missile tests in the Norwegian Sea]{.underline} during Trident
Juncture.102 GPS [jamming is of particular concern to NATO because it
also threatens the safe operation of civilian entities]{.underline}.
NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu noted that [cyberattacks and electronic
warfare have also become more frequent and severe]{.underline}.103

#### Fait accompli is real -- and it's specifically at risk from arctic domain awareness and detection capabilities

[Lackenbauer characterizes]{.underline} the through [threats as those
that "emanate from outside the region and pass through or over it to
strike targets also outside the
region."]{.underline}[\[]{.underline}viii\] A [[prime example would
be]{.mark} a nuclear armed]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic
missile ([[ICBM) launched from]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n heartland
and [headed for]{.mark} the [America]{.mark}n heartland [over the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or it could be Russian nuclear bombers
flying the shortest route to the Canadian and American heartlands.
Another prominent Canadian Arctic security analyst, Prof. Rob Huebert of
the University of Calgary, offers a clear description of the threats
that are animating NORAD modernization.\[ix\] He argues that [the
serious Arctic threat is not to "sovereignty" but to
"security."]{.underline} There are, to be sure, sovereignty issues that
need attention -- like acknowledgement of the waters of Northwest
Passage as internal to Canada, the Beaufort Sea boundary dispute with
the United States, overlapping claims to extended continental shelves --
but these are challenges to be managed to ensure that it is diplomats,
lawyers, and scientists who remain the prime responders. [[The most
immediate military challenge]{.mark}, says Huebert, [is to]{.mark}
convincingly [demonstrate to Russia that it could never "launch a
surprise]{.mark} missile [attack across the Arctic]{.mark} to American
targets [with a chance of succeeding"]{.mark}]{.underline} -- those
targets being in the more southerly Canadian and American heartlands.
Both Huebert and Lackenbauer thus see the threats passing through the
Arctic to targets in the American and Canadian heartlands as the focus
of the military responses, and it is that same category of threats that
drives NORAD modernization. Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy essentially
agrees that the basic military threats in the Arctic are the threats of
attacks passing through the region: the Arctic "[region represents a
geographic vector for traditional and emerging weapons systems that
threaten broader North American and transatlantic security." There is
little prospect that the capacity to defeat threats travelling through
or over the Arctic will]{.underline} ever [be
comprehensive]{.underline}. There is simply no sure defence against
Russian or Chinese nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile
attacks via the Arctic on North America[. Realistically]{.underline},
[there is also no comprehensive defence against massed strategic bombers
bearing nuclear-armed, air-launched, cruise and hypersonic missile
attacks on North America]{.underline}. These systems represent an
existential threat, yet there is no reliable defence against them. [[US
policy relies on nuclear deterrence to prevent such attacks]{.mark}, and
durable prevention requires reliable domain awareness and early
warning]{.underline} (that being NORAD's role), and ongoing diplomacy
aimed at stabilizing relations with adversaries, confidence building
measures towards that end, firm limits on weapons through arms control,
and concrete steps toward the total nuclear disarmament that nuclear
powers have declared to be their ultimate objective -- the kind of
policies which Canada should promote from its seat at the continental
security table. 2. NORAD priorities NORAD's current defence focus is not
on the nuclear threat to the continent -- that is understood to be
covered by nuclear deterrence (for which NORAD provides early warning).
The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and [[NORAD]{.underline}]{.mark} (the
joint Canada/US North American Aerospace Defence Command) [[are]{.mark}
thus [mandated to provide early warning]{.mark} of nuclear armed missile
attacks]{.underline} (but not defence against them), [and early warning
and control or defence]{.underline} against attacks and unauthorized
civilian entries into North American air space, [as well as maritime
early warning and]{.underline} [regional domain
awareness]{.underline}.\[x\] A [major preoccupation is the emergence of
new generations of conventionally armed hypersonic missiles]{.underline}
(able to travel at least five times the speed of sound within the
atmosphere). In 2020, two US Generals, a former Commander of NORAD and a
Deputy Director for Operations of NORAD, elaborated on the latter
concern in a paper entitled "Hardening the Shield."\[xi\] [[A much
improved shield]{.mark}, they argued, [is needed]{.mark} to protect the
North American homeland]{.underline}, especially [from emerging threats
of conventional missile attacks by states like Russia and China on
military and non-military infrastructure]{.underline} in the American
heartland. A key element of the argument is that adversaries seeking to
defeat or intimidate American forces in overseas operations could
threaten conventional attacks on America at home -- to threaten
hit-and-run attacks on vital infrastructure, interrupt American military
mobilization efforts, and generally to [demonstrate to an American
population that military interventions abroad could expose their
homeland to retaliatory conventional attacks on key military, and
civilian, infrastructure: "If the traditional American way of war is the
deployment of overwhelming force to a fight overseas, then the way to
defeat the United States military in the next war, in the minds of her
adversaries, is to prevent deployment in the first place]{.underline}.
Either through the threat of attacks on economic targets designed to
constrain options, or direct strikes on mobilizing forces, the
deployment of the American military must be stopped before it starts.
The economic engine and carefully orchestrated multi-modal logistical
movements that enable the world's preeminent military are now a target."
[[The key worry is that]{.mark} both [Russia and China are]{.mark} busy
developing, and [deploying, long-range]{.mark} cruise and [hypersonic
missiles]{.mark}, for example, against which the homeland missile
defence system]{.underline} (designed to intercept missiles in outer
space) [is defenceless]{.underline} because cruise and hypersonic
missiles do not operate in outer space. And while [[N]{.mark}orth
[A]{.mark}merica [is considered to be protected]{.mark} from nuclear
attack [by deterrence]{.mark}, that same deterrence [is thought not to
be effective against conventional attack]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
notably by those emerging hypersonic missiles. So that is why [both
Russia and China are developing missiles explicitly to evade space-borne
missile defences and that are capable of delivering conventional
warheads]{.underline}. The point is that Russia and China want a
non-nuclear option for attacking military or civilian infrastructure in
the United States on the assumption that a limited conventional attack
would not immediately trigger "devastating retaliation by the nuclear
triad of United States Strategic Command." The calculation is that
"using nuclear weapons against targets in North America in an attempt to
alter the outcome of a regional conflict \[overseas\] would be suicidal,
and so they \[Russia and China\] set out on a deliberate path of
conventional long-range weapons development."\[xii\] And since potential
North American targets are obviously far too numerous to be protected by
"hardening," or to have their own localized missile defences, some
analysts insist it is necessary to mount a capacity to destroy Russian
and Chines missile platforms before they are in range to fire their
missiles at the American heartland -- but that kind of pre-emption
obviously risks major escalation in a conflict. Dealing with this
threat, O'Shaughnessy and Fesler thus argued, needs to become a key
mission of NORAD, and since their flight paths would likely (but need
not always) be through the Arctic[, [modernizing NORAD's northern
warning]{.mark} and interception missions [is still deemed
urgent.]{.mark} The implication is that NORAD upgrades are not so much a
response to Arctic tensions]{.underline} and [vulnerabilities as they
are a response to the more tense and dangerous global strategic
environment]{.underline}. NORAD renewal is also an attempt to maintain
and protect the Pentagon's ability, or freedom, to project force beyond
North American shores. In reviewing the "Hardening the Shield" paper,
the Canadian scholar and NORAD expert, Prof. Andrea Charron, has noted
that the paper is "...a call for a new North American defence
architecture that is both an integral cog in the US deterrence machinery
\[through early warning\] and can 'actively' -- i.e. offensively if
necessary -- defend the homeland so that the US military can maintain
its superiority and freedom of manoeuvre."\[xiii\]

during Operation POLAR VORTEX, [a Naval and Amphibious Liaison
Element]{.underline} (NALE) [led by U.S. 3rd Fleet and supported by U.S.
Fleet Forces]{.underline} was embedded into the bi-national Alaskan
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Region at Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The NALE is primarily a function of the
Navy Reserve, with Reserve personnel filling roughly 98 percent of NALE
billets, given the operational tempo of this unique work. [[NALE
Sailors]{.mark} train in mobilization to billet]{.underline} (MOB
to-billet) positions and generally deploy on 90 to 270-day orders,
responding [[both to planned operations and emergent
crises]{.underline},]{.mark} including training exercises, freedom of
navigation operations, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
MOB-to-billet is the activation (other than for training) of SELRES
Sailors to serve in the authorized and funded manpower billet at the
command to which they are permanently assigned. [[NALE units are
attached to U.S. Fleet Forces Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Naval
Forces Europe and Africa, and most numbered fleets]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While in [Alaska, the NALE worked alongside [U.S. Air Force and Royal
Canadian Air Force (RCAF) members in the 611th Air Operations
Center]{.mark}]{.underline} (AOC) [to [increase domain awareness in the
Arctic region]{.mark} [during Operation POLAR
VORTEX]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by instantly linking maritime and air
domain awareness.]{.underline}]{.mark} "The situational awareness the
NALE has provided is the most maritime awareness the AOC has had in the
14 years I've been here," said Alaska Air National Guard Col. Jeff
Smith, deputy commander, 611th AOC. "It's been great to see the
coordinated efforts between air and maritime domains." By co-locating,
the NALE and 611th AOC were able to coordinate information instantly to
the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and provide a detailed
real-time operating picture from the surface to air across some of the
most remote operating areas in [[Alaska. The NALE worked to seamlessly
integrate their expertise of maritime domain awareness]{.mark} and
employ a Navy P-8 Poseidon alongside joint and bi-national air
assets]{.underline}. The cooperation increased tactical performance of
joint forces validating command and control and tactical execution of
mission objectives between various aircraft including exercising
simulated air-to-surface strikes. "The NALE has been essential to air
operations," said RCAF Brig. Gen. David Moar, deputy commander, Alaskan
NORAD Region. "[They were key in synchronizing air operations with naval
air assets and providing information to enable the JFACC to coordinate
and support the maritime component."]{.underline} 3rd Fleet operations
in U.S. Northern Command's (USNORTHCOM) area of responsibility
throughout the Gulf of Alaska aligned with Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet
objectives to demonstrate resolve and credible deterrence in defense of
the homeland in the area[. [The operations also supported]{.mark}
USNORTHCOM and NORAD's [mission of homeland defense, aerospace warning
and control, and preserving a stable Arctic region in cooperation with
U.S. Allies and partners]{.mark}. "The NALE is an essential part of
integrating the Maritime Operations Center (MOC) and AOC to provide
multi-domain awareness to both Component Commanders,"]{.underline} said
U.S. Navy Capt. Chris "Turtle" Turl, NALE director. "By coordinating
information between each Commander's guidance, the [NALE facilitates the
planning and execution of the mission to effectively meet the
commander's intent]{.underline}." NALE Sailors regularly engage in
training exercises, freedom of navigation operations, and humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief to enable better integration between
joint air assets. The NALE provide the necessary face to-face contact
among planner, commanders and staff to ensure mutual understanding,
unity of effort and reduce friction between components. Operating across
the vast distances and remote areas in the Arctic comes with many
operational hurdles to overcome such as harsh weather and sea conditions
causing increased risk to aircrews should an incident occur. Enhancing
communication between joint forces is essential to meet the mission
while overcoming obstacles and lowering operational risks[. Through
joint and bi-national teamwork the NALE and 611th AOC were able to
maximize domain awareness and more effectively employ air assets saving
time, and costs while reducing risk and increasing efficient use of
tactical air assets and manpower.]{.underline}

[[Discussions centred on NORAD's modernization indicate the potential
for the organization's next evolutionary step]{.underline}]{.mark},
where [[surveillance continues to factor heavily into its overarching
mission goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. Advances in weapons delivery
technologies that are r[[endering current surveillance capabilities
obsolete, combined with the greater interest in the Arctic for economic
exploitation, require improved early warning capabilities in the region
to protect North America's security and strategic advantage shaped by
distance]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the Arctic has remained a focus
within Canadian policy since the end of the Cold War to greater and
lesser degrees, [[the United States has only recently pivoted towards a
renewed interest in the region for supporting national
security]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, given this current binational focus,
technological research and development for enhanced surveillance
capabilities is a significant policy area directed at meeting Arctic
security requirements. Research and development efforts potentially
represent a crucial avenue of contribution by Canada towards Arctic
surveillance in service of both national and binational security.
Besides quantum-based R&D, other ADSA projects may aid the modernization
of NORAD and facilitate greater sensor and intelligence integration with
the United States while contributing towards the minimum 20 percent R&D
spending requirement within NATO.

[[All domain awareness and North American defence]{.underline}]{.mark}
The ADSA program exemplifies Canada's experimental efforts to develop
surveillance technology in the Arctic. [The program is a broader funding
initiative with private and public partners]{.underline} that was
[launched in 2015 and has focused on developing Canada's surveillance
capacity in the Arctic across a spectrum of technologies]{.underline} in
order "to produce innovative solutions to surveillance challenges in the
North."37 Under the ADSA project, Public Works Canada issued a call for
proposals within two broad streams in 2016 that sought solutions for
"Air, Surface, and Sub-Surface Surveillance, and Sensor/Information
Mixes S&T" as well as

38 [The ADSA program focuses on assessing and developing surveillance
technologies for the future, especially those that can automatically
detect and classify objects of interest (including advanced weapons
systems) within complex and densely populated environmental
conditions]{.mark}. There [is currently a significant gap in the state's
identification and parsing abilities, indicating the need to classify
and discriminate "threatening" from "non-threatening" objects in the
Arctic's challenging environmental conditions and diverse
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requirement is expected to increase
relative to the future growth in Arctic sea vessel traffic.
Specifically, greater access to the Arctic resulting from extended
ice-free periods will create a set of vulnerabilities in the border
regions of littoral Arctic states. [[Consequently, one of Canada's chief
concerns in the Arctic is being able to secure the "flow of
goods]{.mark} and -[capacity is important beyond domestic considerations
and is critical to North American defence more
widely]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Specifically, Canada's research
and development (R&D) efforts for enhanced surveillance and intelligence
capabilities within the ADSA and other related programs are also
expected to contribute to NORAD's modernization and renewal of the
NWS.40 For example, Canada is interested in the practice of quantum
illumination and researching its potential application with radar
systems. Quantum is poised to become a significant avenue of research
focus for Canada with the recent release of National Defence's Quantum
Science and Technology Strategy. Regarding surveillance, there is a
research focus on "quantum sensing," which surpasses the performance of
traditional applications in terms of measurement accuracy.41 In addition
to the Quantum S&T Strategy, the University of Waterloo's Institute for
Quantum Computing (IQC) received a \$2.7 million contract through the
ADSA program. Under this research contract, technology and techniques
enabling quantum illumination are being studied for their potential
contribution to remote sensing methods that overcome the natural
environmental challenges posed to conventional radar presented in the
Arctic.42 38. Ibid. 39. Public Works and Government Services Canada

At a [[recent CEPA-]{.mark}hosted press briefing[, experts explored
critical gaps in NATO's Arctic capabilities]{.mark} for Western and
Northern European nations to enhance regional security.]{.underline}
Responding to my question---*"Are there any specific capability gaps in
the Arctic that you see as standout opportunities for Western and
Northern European nations, including the UK, to address? How might these
nations best position themselves to enhance Arctic stability and
security through collaboration or specialisation?"*---the panellists
offered insightful analysis into NATO's readiness and requirements in
the High North. A Comprehensive Perspective on Arctic Readiness [Mathieu
B[oulègue, Senior Fellow at CEPA, emphasised]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[NATO possesses most]{.mark} of the [necessary Arctic
capabilities]{.mark} [but]{.mark} [needs better integration and
coordination.]{.mark}]{.underline} *"To be honest, we're not missing
much. We already have everything. It's just a question of making sure
the inventory is clearly outlined and that we don't reinvent the
wheel,"* he said. With Finland and Sweden joining NATO, Boulègue noted
the Alliance's growing Arctic presence. He stressed that the challenge
lies in creating coherence across capabilities: *"How do we integrate
all of that into a coherent whole that makes the Alliance stronger and
more aware of what's happening in the region?"* [[Boulègue identified
domain awareness]{.mark}, [particularly]{.mark} in [maritime and subsea
operations]{.mark}, [as a critical gap]{.mark}. He [pointed to]{.mark}
the [post-Cold War decline]{.mark} in [capabilities for submarine
tracking and remote sensing as areas]{.mark} [requiring urgent
attention]{.mark}.]{.underline} *"NATO's dream of reaching a
seabed-to-space domain awareness is achievable, but it will take time,
collaboration, and patience,"* he remarked. CEPA Report on Arctic
Security A recent report from the Center for European Policy Analysis
(CEPA), titled *Up North: Confronting Arctic Insecurity -- Implications
for the United States and NATO*, explores the rapidly evolving security
landscape in the Arctic. The [study [highlights challenges posed by
Russia's increased military operations]{.mark} and [the broader
implications of strategic competition]{.mark}, climate change, [and
critical domain awareness gaps]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Key
insights]{.underline} from the report [[include: Russia's growing use of
low-intensity warfare tactics]{.mark}, including [air incursions, GPS
jamming, electronic warfare, and subsea activities targeting critical
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Risks of miscalculation or
unintended escalation at Arctic choke [points. [Persistent gaps in
allied domain awareness]{.mark}, compounded by overlapping command
structures. [The need]{.mark} for a [unified NATO approach to Arctic
security]{.mark}, bolstered by [Finland's and Sweden's]{.mark} recent
[accession to the alliance]{.mark}. Recommendations for an Arctic
Military Code of Conduct and increased use of emerging technologies like
uncrewed systems and space-based assets to improve deterrence and
defence. [The report emphasises the importance of creating a predictable
and transparent security framework tailored to Arctic
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Minna Ålander, Senior Fellow
at CEPA, highlighted a different yet equally vital challenge---basic
survival skills and operational readiness in Arctic conditions. *"We
have troops, but do they know how to survive in the Arctic? This is one
actually non-trivial question,"* she said. Ålander explained that the
extreme conditions of the Arctic present unique requirements, such as
sustaining battery life in freezing temperatures and ensuring robust
logistics and basing infrastructure. She stressed the importance of
specialised training and noted that only a few NATO allies, such as
Finland, the UK, the US, and some neighbouring nations, possess the
necessary Arctic capabilities. *"Not every nation has to develop Arctic
warfare capabilities. Spain, for example, doesn't need to, but the
countries present in the Arctic must focus on this,"* Ålander added. She
underlined the significance of exercises to build and maintain these
essential skills. Strategic Collaboration Lance Landrum, another CEPA
expert, echoed the importance of integration and coherence, describing
*"all-domain awareness from the seabed to space"* as vital for Arctic
operations. He emphasised that NATO's regional plans should bring
together capabilities across land, sea, air, and the electromagnetic
spectrum to create a unified deterrence strategy. *"The Alliance needs
to demonstrate readiness through regular presence, exercises, and
training to show that nations are together, aware, and ready to
respond,"* he said. Opportunities for the UK The discussion underscored
that while NATO has substantial capabilities, the Alliance must refine
its approach to Arctic security through enhanced integration, strategic
planning, and addressing specific gaps in awareness and operational
readiness. For the UK, which already plays a significant role in Arctic
security, this means leveraging its expertise in cold-weather operations
and collaborating with allies to strengthen NATO's presence in the High
North. The Arctic is increasingly becoming a focal point of geopolitical
competition, and NATO's ability to adapt and act cohesively will
determine its success in maintaining stability in this strategically
vital region. As the experts noted, collaboration, integration, and
preparation are key to ensuring that NATO and its allies remain ready to
address the unique challenges posed by the Arctic environment.

Sensors The sensor component of the U.S[. [missile]{.mark}
[defense]{.mark} [system]{.mark} is [distributed]{.mark} across the
land, sea,]{.underline} and space domains and [[provides]{.mark} the
[United States and its allies]{.mark} [with]{.mark} an [early]{.mark}
[warning]{.mark}]{.underline} of a launch of enemy ballistic missiles in
addition to [missile [tracking]{.mark} and
discrimination]{.underline}.76 These sensors [can detect a ballistic
missile launch, track a missile in flight[,]{.mark} and even classify
the type of projectile, its speed, and the target against which the
missile has been directed]{.underline}. They relay this information to
the command and control stations that operate interceptor systems like
Aegis (primarily a sea-based system) or THAAD (a land-based system).
Land-Based. On land, the major sensor installations are the Upgraded
Early Warning Radars (UEWRs), which are concentrated along the North
Atlantic and Pacific corridors that present the most direct flight path
for a missile aimed at the United States. They include the phased array
UEWRs based in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, the United Kingdom,
and Greenland that scan objects up to 3,000 miles away.77 They
[[support]{.mark} [homeland]{.mark} [missile]{.mark} [defense]{.mark} by
providing early warning and [improving]{.mark} the [quality]{.mark} [of
midcourse tracking data]{.mark}]{.underline}.78 The United States also
deploys mobile AN/TPY-2 land-based sensors. Of the 12 AN/TPY-2 systems
that have been produced so far, five "are operating in forward-based
mode worldwide in support of the U.S. and its allies" and seven "are
operating in terminal mode as part of THAAD weapon systems in support of
Army and regional defense Missions."79 According to Admiral Hill, "Radar
13, planned for delivery in March 2025, will be part of THAAD Battery 8
and be a fully modernized configuration that includes significant
obsolescence redesigns leveraged from our ongoing Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) cases."80. In cooperation with the Republic of Korea, the United
States deploys a THAAD missile system accompanied by an AN/TPY-2 on the
Korean Peninsula. To [[fill]{.mark} a [gap]{.mark} [in]{.mark} missile
[discrimination]{.mark} capability for tracking North Korean missiles
[over]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Pacific]{.mark},]{.underline} the MDA is
developing the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in
[[northern]{.mark} [Alaska]{.mark} to [improve]{.mark} [coverage]{.mark}
in the northern Pacific]{.underline}. The LRDR utilizes the SPY-7 radar,
which the MDA will also purchase for the Guam defense system.81 The DOD
has also identified the need to develop the Homeland Defense
Radar--Hawaii (HDR--H) to fill a [tracking and discrimination
gap]{.underline} over Hawaii. The FY 2024 budget request includes
\$103.5 million for the radar, which will support the completion of
acceptance testing and enable an operational flight test in FY 2023.82
Sea-Based. There are two types of sea-based sensors. The first is the
Sea-Based X-band (SBX) radar, which is "mounted on a mobile,
ocean-going, semi-submersible platform that provides the missile defense
system with an extremely powerful and capable radar that can be
positioned to cover any region of the globe."83 SBX is employed
primarily in the Pacific. The second is the SPY-1 radar system, which is
mounted on U.S. Navy vessels equipped with the Aegis Combat System and
is therefore able to [[provide]{.mark} [data]{.mark} [that]{.mark} can
be [utilized]{.mark} [for]{.mark} ballistic [missile]{.mark}
missions]{.underline}. The Navy is installing the radar on 29 new ships
and replacing all SPY-1 radars with the SPY-6 radar, which will have a
greater detection range and other advanced capabilities.84 Space-Based.
Finally, U.S. missile defense sensors operate in space. From the
ultimate high ground, space-based sensors have the potential to detect
and track missile launches from almost any location from boost phase to
terminal phase, unlike ground-based radars that are limited in their
tracking range.85 The MDA, the U.S. Space Force, and the Space
Development Agency (SDA) all control aspects of the space missile
defense sensor system. The oldest system that contributes to the missile
defense mission is the Defense Support Program (DSP), a constellation of
satellites that use infrared sensors to identify heat from booster and
missile plumes to detect an initial launch. In 2020, the Department of
Defense awarded a \$222.5 million contract to keep the program going
through 2030.86 The DSP satellite system has gradually been replaced by
the Space-Based Infrared Radar System (SBIRS) to improve the delivery of
missile defense and battlefield intelligence.87 Because SBIRS can scan a
wide swath of territory while simultaneously tracking a specific target,
for example, it is useful in observing tactical, or short-range,
ballistic missiles.88 The Space Force launched the sixth and final SBIRS
satellite in August 2022.89 The Air Force originally planned to launch
eight SBIRS satellites, but because of congressional funding delays, it
decided to end production of SBIRS early and move on to development of
its replacement, the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared
(Next-Gen OPIR) satellite, in 2017.90 Additionally, **[[improved]{.mark}
[sensor]{.mark} capabilities are [critical]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
addressing the [cruise]{.mark} missile [threat]{.mark} [to the
homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As noted previously, the United States
has no dedicated missile defense system to counter this threat. Because
of their low altitude in flight and uncertain trajectories, cruise
missiles are more difficult to detect and track than ballistic missiles
are. [[Russia's]{.mark} ability to [strike]{.mark} [key]{.mark}
strategic [nodes]{.mark} in the U.S.]{.underline} homeland from its own
territory is of [particular concern]{.underline}. To address this
threat, General VanHerck has emphasized improving domain awareness,
because [[early]{.mark} [identification]{.mark} of a threat allows for
options]{.underline} like left-of-launch operations
(**[[destroying]{.mark} a missile [before]{.mark} it is
[launched]{.mark} [or]{.mark} [preventing]{.mark} its launch [by]{.mark}
[neutralizing]{.mark} launch [enablers]{.mark}) [or]{.mark}
[alerting]{.mark} forces to take [precautionary]{.mark}
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.106 The Department of Defense is
requesting \$428.7 million in the FY 2024 defense budget "for the
continued fielding of four new over-the-horizon radars."107 These radars
will provide long-range sensor coverage of likely air and cruise missile
threats to North America, as well as a capability against hypersonic
threats, and maritime surface vessels. NORTHCOM's unfunded priorities
list for FY 2024 includes \$212 million for nine long-range radars "to
fill surveillance gaps caused by existing radar failures."108 (This
refers to Chinese balloon intrusions early in 2023 that initially went
undetected.109) **[Additionally, developing a capability to detect,
track, and eventually intercept a conventional cruise missile attack
will be [critical]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [denying]{.mark}
[adversaries]{.mark} the ability to [hold the homeland]{.mark} at risk
below the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**. The Space Force removed one
of three planned geosynchronous orbit satellites, a part of the Next-Gen
OPIR program, from its FY 2024 budget request.110 The Army is also
progressing on development of the Lower-Tier Air and Missile Defense
System (LTAMDS) radars that will provide 360-degree threat coverage for
PAC-3 and other regional missile defense batteries; the current Patriot
radar can scan only one-third of the sky at a time.111 The LTAMDS
program has experienced "cascading delays," and the current plan is to
move it to the major capability acquisition phase in FY 2024.112

intermediate range) along with intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) with ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers that directly threaten
the United States. With the advent of longer range North Korean missiles
that extend beyond the PACOM Area of Responsibility (AOR), updated and
more effective procedures and institutions are needed to handle both the
regional and homeland missions. The geographic combatant commands (GCCs)
simultaneously face increasing fiscal challenges of manpower and budget
cuts. To adapt and maintain the flexibility needed in the complex
ballistic missile defense ([BMD]{.underline}) operational environment,
GCCs should rely on regionally focused Integrated Air and Missile
Defense (IAMD) Center of Excellence (CoE) to develop a joint missile
defense cadre to [[counter]{.mark} the growing [regional]{.mark} and
homeland missile [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. A PACOM IAMD CoE would
[provide [a cost-effective integration mechanism]{.mark} for [U.S. and
partner nation BMD]{.mark} officers]{.underline}, while providing the
forum for information and data sharing between missile defense systems.
MOUNTING CONCERNS In the 2013 Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threat
Assessment, the U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC)
partnered with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's Missile and Space
Intelligence Center and the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence to
predict a regional and homeland defense dilemma. Examples of the problem
included North Korea's new road-mobile Hwasong-13 ICBM and continued
development of the Taepo Dong-2, which placed the Unha (Galaxy)
satellite in orbit in December 2012, according to a 2013 NASIC report.
The Hwasong-13, commonly referred to as the KN08, along with the Musudan
intermediate range ballistic missile, embody both the regional and
homeland defense threat faced by PACOM. Although neither the KN08 nor
the Musudan has been operationally tested, the display of prototypes at
parades, along with continued [[nuclear]{.mark} [tests]{.mark},
demonstrates [increased]{.mark} [ballistic]{.mark} [missile]{.mark}
[volatility]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Members of the Japan
Self Defense Forces deploy Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile
interceptor units at the Defense Ministry in Shinjyuku Ward, Tokyo, in
April 2013 after North Korea threatened to launch a ballistic missile.
PACOM Commander Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III said in November 2013 that
an unpredictable and nucleararmed North Korea presents the most danger
to the world within his area of military command, according to an
Associated Press report. The command stretches from the West Coast of
the U.S. to the western border of India and encompasses more than 50
percent of the Earth's surface, "yet not long or big enough to out
distance long range ballistic missiles," the Navy Times reported in
November 2013. INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION [The [increasing]{.mark}
[proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline} of longer range missiles and the
[[need]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline} cross-combatant command along
with [allied [coordination]{.mark} will continue [to]{.mark}
[grow]{.mark}. I]{.underline}n the same NASIC report, Iran's regional
missile inventory continues to climb with an expectation the country
will field an ICBM (thus cross-combatant command challenge) as early as
2015. Like [North]{.mark} [Korea]{.mark}, [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}
has developed a space launch vehicle, which has the potential [to
[launch]{.mark} a [missile]{.mark} [reaching]{.mark} the [United
State]{.mark}]{.underline}[s.]{.mark} In the updated version of U.S. Air
Force doctrine on Countering Air and Missile Threats released March 23,
2012, the term global missile defense was introduced as "defense against
ballistic missile threats that cross one or more geographical combatant
command boundaries and requires synchronization among the affected
combatant commands." To facilitate this coordination, U.S. Strategic
Command assumed the role as the homeland "global synchronizer" for
missile defense planning and operations and exercised through its Joint
Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense at Colorado
Springs, Colorado. In parallel, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)
headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, leads [overall BMD research and
development and serves as the acquisition agency]{.underline} for U.S.
BMD systems. For regional defense, the GCCs are responsible for planning
and executing BMD within their AORs. To meet these new and emerging
challenges, PACOM has begun an operationalization of its headquarters,
and the command's BMD division performing the dual role of regional and
[homeland defense epitomizes this transformation.]{.underline} This
specifically refers to the "process of adapting or transforming the
combatant command's people, processes and products to support,
effectively and timely, decision-making by the commander in the
execution of assigned objectives and end states," according to PACOM
operations planners. The GCCs should continue to pursue the path of
internationalizing through regional-specific IAMD centers. This would
provide a d[edicated forum to [integrate U.S. and allied BMD]{.mark}
systems through a [mutually]{.mark} [beneficial]{.mark}
[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the identification and
coordination of regional BMD technologies would streamline the process
for testing and exercises. The IAMD CoE would provide a consolidated and
direct feedback mechanism to the MDA and other U.S. agencies on the
cyclic development of fielded BMD systems. It would counter critics who
view the current BMD policy as U.S. homeland-centric because it would
highlight the regional shared concerns. **[It would also counter the
argument that missile defense destabilizes the region. Instead, it seeks
to [provide security to the U.S. and its allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
DEFENSE BY DETERRENCE The prominent defense strategist Robert Jarvis
classified deterrence as either "**[[deterrence by denial" or
"deterrence by punishment]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Active missile
defense such as BMD embraces the former, **[[seeking]{.mark} [to]{.mark}

[doubt]{.mark} in the minds [of]{.mark} [adversaries]{.mark} [who seek

through surface-to-surface missiles. [Instead of relying on pre-emptive
strikes, the goal is to build effective defensives and partnerships in
response to belligerent and destabilizing behaviors]{.underline}. The
U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) have
already reaped benefits from establishing regional IAMD centers. The Al
Bateen center in the United Arab Emirates has leveraged its missile
defense attendees to develop joint and coalition plans with the
six-member Gulf Cooperation Council. The EUCOM center, through the NATO
construct, has spearheaded missile defense and become the benchmark for
allied senior level planning, exercise and integration. Each geographic
command should have its own center to focus on unique problems.

Missile Defense Ballistic missile defense ([[BMD]{.underline}]{.mark})
is widely recognized as a **[[critical]{.mark} component of
[national]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [regional]{.mark} [security]{.mark} and
has the potential to [contribute]{.mark} [significantly]{.mark} to
[deterrence]{.mark}, [assurance]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [damage]{.mark}
[limitation]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a dynamic strategic environment.
Strategic missile defenses were severely 20 Strategic Studies Quarterly
♦ Fall 2017A Nuclear Review for a New Age restricted by treaty for 30
years on the assumption that they undermined "[[stable]{.mark}"
[mutual]{.mark} [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, missile
[threats]{.underline} facing the United States and its allies have been
[expanding for decade]{.underline}s, and homeland and regional defenses
now are accepted as essential contributors to security. Indeed, BMD can
support all three priority purposes of US nuclear capabilities in
general: Deterrence. BMD can contribute to deterrence in several ways.
First, it may provide the [United States with very useful alternatives
to offensive preemption or retaliation in crises.]{.underline} This was
the case, for example, in the days prior to North Korea's 2006
Taepodong-2 launch, when the deployment of a limited US homeland-defense
system gave President Bush an alternative to a preemptive strike on the
North Korean missile site (as was recommended by some at the time).
Second, by helping to [deny adversaries [plausible]{.mark}
[limited]{.mark} [nuclear first-use options]{.mark} [against]{.mark}
[US]{.mark} allies and the US homeland]{.underline}, BMD can discourage
even determined opponents from pursuing such dangerous strategies and
deny their effectiveness in cases where opponents choose such
strategies. Third, by r[elieving [pressure]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[strike]{.mark} an adversary's launchers]{.underline} preemptively in
crises, effective BMD also can **[[buy]{.mark} [time]{.mark} for leaders
to [pursue diplomacy or nonnuclear means]{.mark} of averting [or
limiting escalation]{.mark} in an emerging nuclear
crisis]{.underline}**. Finally, point defense for critical military
assets at home and abroad can enhance the survivability of US and
Western deterrence forces that an adversary otherwise might believe it
could eliminate by preemptive attack---thereby strengthening deterrence
and discouraging opponents from dangerous first-strike concepts.
Assurance. First, by [[reducing the potential costs of conflict]{.mark}
with]{.underline} an ICBM-capable [adversary]{.underline}, missile
defense of the US homeland can [[improve the credibility of US security
guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} to allies by helping to counter an
opponent's possible expectation that nuclear threats to the US homeland
will work to decouple the United States from allies. Second, regional
missile [defenses]{.underline} help to [reinforce assurance by providing
local defensive capabilities]{.underline} while demonstrating the US
security commitment. Finally, the cooperative process of developing and
deploying missile defenses helps to **[[build stronger alliance
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}** and gives the United States a
larger presence in, and commitment to, allies' security. Damage
limitation. Missile defenses can contribute to damage limitation by
helping to discourage an adversary from escalating a conf lict and by
providing a potentially meaningful degree of direct societal 21
Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Fall 2017 Keith B. Payne, John S. Foster
Jr., and Gary L. Geipel protection in many plausible conflict scenarios.
**[[BMD]{.mark} also can provide [unique]{.mark}
[damage]{.mark}-[limitation]{.mark} capabilities [against]{.mark} the
possibility of an [accidental]{.mark} [or unauthorized missile
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Finally, BMD can help provide a
relatively near-term counter to the emerging North Korean missile
threat---a defensive alternative to the option of a preemptive strike
often discussed publicly. In addition, BMD may contribute to the goal of
dissuading some adversaries from acquiring missile capabilities in the
first place. For example, the prospect of strong US BMD against
long-range ICBMs from Iran or North Korea could help discourage their
continued investment of scarce resources in the development of such
weapons. In short, far from being an impediment to deterrence, BMD has
emerged as a potentially crucial element in support of deterrence---
particularly with regard **[[to smaller and more unpredictable nuclear
adversarie]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. BMD can also contribute uniquely to
US assurance and damage-limitation goals. Recommendations for
consideration to help improve the contributions of BMD to deterrence,
assurance, and damage limitation include, for example: improving and
expanding US capabilities for homeland defense, including defense
against cruise missiles and potentially hypersonic missiles; expanding
and accelerating SM-3 capabilities; the fielding of a space-based layer
of sensors for persistent "birth-to-death" missile tracking and
discrimination; providing operational capability to the Aegis Ashore
Missile Defense Test Complex in Kauai, Hawaii; and, inter alia,
continuing readiness efforts for a possible

As a child in 1990s Belgium, Sanne Verschuren watched news of the Balkan
war's horrific carnage. "Why are these people fighting?" she recalls
asking her grandfather. "Why can't they just make peace?" Later, her law
school thesis at Ghent University focused on the regulation of new
military technologies---such as drones---under international law. "That
puzzlement of why people fight, and at such massive scales," drives her
research into weapons of war, from nuclear weapons to antimissile
defense, says Verschuren, an assistant professor of international
security at the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee School of Global
Studies. "Military technology, to me, sits at the crossroads of a lot of
different things. It's a legal question, a political question, a social
question, a budgetary question---it's a question of imagination." Photo:

Photo courtesy BU Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies In recent
studies, she's explored how weapons shape international security policy
and national security decision-making, and particularly what motivates
states to throw money at some weapon systems over others. One conclusion
she's come to is that averting nuclear Armageddon with large-scale
missile defenses is a pipe dream, dating back to President Ronald
Reagan's hope of deploying a space-based, antimissile "Star Wars" shield
to take down Soviet long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, or
ICBMs. She's also questioned more earthbound systems, particularly the
continuing technical difficulties around the Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense ([GMD]{.underline}) System, which is designed to take down North
Korean [[ICBMs]{.mark}, and the lack of data around [battlefield
effectiveness of shorter-range defensive
syste]{.mark}]{.underline}[ms]{.mark}, like those used **[in Israel's
[Iron]{.mark} [Dome]{.mark} mobile [air defense system]{.mark} or the
Patriot [system included in Western aid to
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Verschuren---who is finalizing her first
book, about how and why states develop weapon technologies---cautions
that when it comes to literal bang for the buck, the numbers are on the
side of an attacker. "The United States government has spent at least
\$350 billion on missile defense over the last seven decades," she says.
"It's a ton of money for systems that still face significant technical
challenges. These systems also have important implications for
international stability, particularly the relationships between
nuclear-armed states." She discussed the wisdom of those investments and
the fragile state of that nuclear stability with The Brink. Q&A With
Sanne Verschuren The Brink: How does your research support---or
not---defense systems? [[When]{.mark} Israel was [attacked]{.mark} by
Iran]{.underline}, Iron Dome supposedly showed [that [missile]{.mark}
[defense]{.mark} [worked]{.mark}.]{.underline} Verschuren: While Iron
Dome and \[Israel's antiballistic missile\] [Arrow 3 appear to have
[intercepted some of the 300 drones]{.mark}, [cruise]{.mark}
[missiles]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [ballistic]{.mark} [missiles]{.mark}
that Iran fired toward Israel, a significant role]{.underline} was
played by the American, British, French, and Jordanian air forces[. It
was also the [first]{.mark} [time]{.mark} that the Aegis [BMD]{.mark}, a
ship-based missile defense system, [was]{.mark} [used]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} [action]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even short-range missile
defense systems have a mixed record. Patriot \[the US Army's primary
defensive missile system\] was engaged for the first time in the 1991
Gulf War. There was a low rate of interception of Iraqi missiles---maybe
even just one. While the technology has come a long way since the early
1990s, it is important to continue to examine the success rate of these
systems in combat. In Ukraine, we can find videos on X \[formerly
Twitter\] of successful engagements, but we also see videos of things
going wrong. Likewise, we should be careful about our interpretation of
the thwarting of the Iran attack. In the end, we were talking about
relatively low-flying, unsophisticated drones and cruise missiles---with
advanced warning. This was not the hardest stuff in the world to
intercept. While some commentators use Ukraine and Israel to claim
success of the overall missile defense mission, short-range missile
defense systems, such as Patriot, and air defense systems, like Iron
Dome, have nothing to do with high-end stuff. The interception of ICBMs?
Yeah. Interception of those missiles takes place outside of \[Earth's\]
atmosphere. ICBMs have countermeasures---things that an adversary puts
in place to ensure that its missiles can penetrate defenses. This can
range from increasing the size of the attack by adding multiple warheads
to a missile to the use of decoys. All of this makes it harder for the
[[interceptor]{.mark} to [identify]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [take down the
nuclear warhead]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Russian and Chinese
ICBMs have such sophisticated countermeasures that the US system cannot
deal with those things. Another problem is what I call "the numbers
game." Defenses are much more expensive than offensive systems. All the
drones and cruise missiles that Iran sent must not have cost that much
money. The means of interception, whether it was the aircraft or air and
missile defense systems, is reported to have cost more than \$1 billion.
Interceptors cost a lot of money, compared to what is being shot at
them. Another dimension of the numbers game is that countries have
defensive systems in far fewer numbers. You're going to have to use
multiple interceptors to take down one ICBM---you really do not want to
have a nuclear weapon explode on your territory.

Effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome System.

[[Ballistic]{.mark} [Missile]{.mark} [Defense]{.mark}]{.underline}:
Effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome System (July 19, 2012) Recently, the
missile defense-related issue I have been asked about most frequently
(my dentist asked me a few days ago) is the [effectiveness]{.underline}
of Israel's Iron Dome system against short range rockets launched from
the Gaza Strip into southern Israel. Many recent press reports have
cited engagement success rates **[[as high as 90%,]{.mark} [while other
reports are as low as about 75]{.mark}%.]{.underline}** My preliminary
assessment based on the public literature (largely newspapers, which are
often contradictory) is that [that success rate is about
75%.]{.underline} I will update this assessment as I come across more
information. (Image source:
http://www.rafael.co.il/marketing/SIP_STORAGE/FILES/6/946.pdf) The
standard operating procedure for Iron Dome is to fire two interceptors
in each engagement, although it is unclear if that was the case in the
first round of engagements. Each interceptor costs about \$50,000. The
success rate we are interested in is thus the fraction of rockets that
that Iron Dome attempts to intercept that it actually destroys, not the
success rate of a single interceptor. The first Iron Dome battery (a
typical battery includes a radar and three launchers, each holding 20
Tamir interceptors) was deployed on March 27, 2011 near Beersheba, the
largest city in Israel's Negev Desert and about 40 km from the Gaza
strip.\[1\] Prior to deployment, [the [system reportedly had a 100%
success rate in tests]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[2\] By the time the system
was first used, a second battery had been deployed near Ashqelon
(somewhat more than 10 km north of the Gaza strip), and Iron Dome's
first successful intercept occurred here on April 7 against a Grad 122
mm rocket.\[3\] Over the next few days, a total of 9 or 10 engagements
took place (including the first one), of which 8 were successful. The
second round of engagements took place in late August 2011. [About
[130]{.mark} [rockets]{.mark}]{.underline}, mostly Grads and Qassams
[were fired]{.underline} from Gaza.\[4\] Only 27 were assessed as
threatening. The Jerusalem Post later reported [[22 of 28 rockets
engaged were successfully intercepted]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[5\] This is
consistent with official's statements shortly after the attack that
[Iron [Dome had been 78% effective]{.mark}]{.underline} during the
August attacks.\[6\] Most of the failures were attributed to operator
error although some were said to be caused by malfunctions of the
interceptor missile.\[7\] The third Iron Dome battery was deployed on
August 31, 2011 near Ashdod, further north up the coast from
Ashqelon.\[8\] The final Iron Dome engagements of 2011 took place in
late October. All three Iron Dome batteries were involved in
engagements. However, out of a total of 9 engagements, only three were
successful.\[9\] The low success rate was attributed to a radar problem,
which has since reportedly been fixed.\[10\] Thus for all of 2011, we
have approximately:\[11[\] April: 8 out 10 (= 80%) [August: 22 out of 28
(= 79%) October: 3 out 9 (= 33%) Total: 33 out of 47 (=
70%]{.mark})]{.underline} Almost all of the 2012 numerical discussions
of Iron Dome effectiveness attribute to it an effectiveness of 75% in
2011. This appears to be slightly too high based on the numbers I have
been able to find. The largest episode of Iron Dome usage occurred from
about March 9 to March 15, 2012. According to Pentagon Press Secretary
George Little, "[When nearly [300]{.mark} [rockets]{.mark} and mortars
were [fired]{.mark}]{.underline} at southern Israel, Iron Dome
intercepted over [[80 percent]{.mark} of the targets it [engaged, saving
many civilian lives]{.mark}.]{.underline}"\[12\] The most detailed
numerical discussion of the March 2012 attack I have been able to find
is the following: "Of the 250 or so rockets and mortars fired at Israel
from Gaza, 166 entered Israel's airspace, officials said. Of those, 74
would have struck civilian areas or buildings. The Iron Dome system
intercepted 56 before they could land, a success rate of 75 percent.
Israeli official argue that the Iron Dome also identified rockets that
were headed for open areas, such as fields, and let them land. Factoring
those in, Israeli military officials argue that only 18 of the 166
landed anywhere on target, giving the system a success rate of nearly 90
percent."\[13\] This statement makes clear that the often-cited figure
of 90% applies to the March 2012 attacks and is not actually the
effectiveness of Iron Dome. Rather it is simply the fraction of rockets
that enter Israel's airspace that either are successfully intercepted or
fall outside Iron Dome's defended areas. This account is generally
consistent with other reports that Iron Dome intercepted about 50 or 60
rockets during the March attacks, or that in total it had intercepted
about 90 rockets.\[14\] A fifth round of Iron Dome operations took place
in around the middle of June 2012, when 7 successful intercepts were
reported.\[15\] I have not seen any reports of how many engagements were
actually attempted, although apparently at least 150 rockets were fired.
In July, Israel deployed an Iron Dome battery near Eilat, on the Red
Sea.\[16\] It is unclear (to me) if this is a fourth battery or a
redeployment of one of the first three batteries, as the deployment was
described as a routine rotation. Overall assessment: Iron Dome appears
to be about 75% effective against the rockets launched from the Gaza
Strip.

Other potential in-kind contributions have also been raised. For
instance, **[[American military officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- not
least the **[Commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM Admiral Bill
Gortney]{.underline}** -- [have **[shown interest
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[having [multi-purpose sensors in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which would be **[capable of tracking
aircraft, maritime vessels, and cruise and ballistic
missiles]{.underline}**.42 [One]{.underline} clear
[advantage]{.underline} is that these continental surveillance rad1ars,
which defence [scientists]{.underline} at Defence Research and
Development Canada [are]{.underline} currently
[researching]{.underline},43 would [have]{.underline} multiple [uses
beyond]{.underline} simply [BMD]{.underline} in a region where
[**[all-domain awareness will become increasingly needed for both
security and sovereignty]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Yet such a system,
reliant on multiple assets in an unforgiving environment, would
assuredly be more expensive than a single site at Goose Bay. Even here,
however, there are reasons why this option could gain traction. First,
**[it would be used to replace an]{.underline}** already **[existing
line]{.underline}** of [radar stations]{.underline}, the **[North
Warning System (NWS), which is near the end of [its]{.mark} service
life.]{.underline}**44 The NWS needs to be either replaced or modernized
in any event, so it might be [**[tempting to use this
opportunity]{.underline}** [to **provide a**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[n
in-kind [contribution to the GMD system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second,
since [it]{.mark} has **[multiple uses beyond aerospace warning and
control]{.underline}**, such a radar line [could **[benefit additional
actors and agencies]{.underline}**]{.mark} [apart from NORAD]{.mark} --
thereby [opening up the]{.underline} number of operational
[stakeholders]{.underline} who **[may be asked to provide
funding]{.underline}**. Third, by [**[linking the replacement for the
NWS to BMD]{.underline}**,]{.mark} Canada may hope that it would be able
to entice the United States to cover the high expect cost of this
project, much as **[Canada had done in the Cold War]{.underline}**.
Another possibility is to eschew **[land-based proposals]{.underline}**
altogether and to focus instead on possible spacebased assets. The
potential for such a contribution was demonstrated by the launch of the
Project Sapphire satellite, which contributes to the US Space
Surveillance Network. The satellite might not be designed to track
ballistic missiles, but it does raise the prospect of Canada deploying a
satellite that could be linked to the US Space Tracking and Satellite
System (STSS), once this space-based BMD sensor network is finally
operational.45 Such a system would **[provide sensor information to

During panel two, participants discussed the elements of **[conventional

**[Pakistan]{.underline}** Navy by the idea of [limited war under the
nuclear threshold]{.underline}. Participants focused on two critical
elements in [mitigating the risks]{.underline} associated with naval
activity: clear [rules of **engagement**]{.underline} that are well
understood within the navy itself, and clear [communication between
navies]{.underline} during peacetime that can prevent
**[misunderstandings from escalating into conflict]{.underline}**.
Further, as one speaker noted, the characteristics of the event that
sparks hostilities will be critical in determining wartime objectives
and goals. Whatever the precipitating event, however, there can be **[no

The Pakistani speaker opened his remarks with a discussion of the
[difficulties associated with conducting a **[limited war under the
nuclear threshold]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In such a war,
[escalation]{.mark} would be very difficult to control, [with the
likelihood of]{.mark} achieving [a]{.mark} so-called [victory
uncertain]{.mark}. Nevertheless, [as]{.mark} both [sides [increase
their]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline} and
seek advanced conventional assets, [the]{.mark} Pakistan [Navy
must]{.mark} continue to [fulfill its primary function]{.mark} [of
**[deterring aggression]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with credible
capability]{.underline}, [ensuring]{.mark} Pakistan's **[[maritime
interests]{.mark} across all aspects of this domain]{.underline}**.
**[As India improves its conventional capabilities, Pakistan feels
compelled to reinforce its strategic deterrence]{.underline}** [to make
up for this growing conventional asymmetry.]{.mark} In particular,
India's **[[introduction of nuclear-armed ballistic missile
submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other advanced naval technologies
creates new risks in the [maritime domain]{.underline} for Pakistan. The
U.S. speaker noted that during the Cold War the U.S. and the Soviet
Union found it **[necessary to engage one another directly to mitigate
the risks]{.underline}** associated with naval activity. [Because navies
operate in an [open area devoid of physical

NORAD expert Andrea Charron describes this unprecedented transformation
comprising a shifting geostrategic and geopolitical landscape in
conjunction with the [**emergence of new weapons systems** in her
evaluation of the evolution of North American defence]{.underline}.36
The former NORAD and USNORTHCOM Commander, General Terrence
O'Shaughnessy, states that "We face a more competitive and dangerous
international security environment today then we have in generations.
And like yesterday, our security environment is marked by the
re-emergence of Great Power competition with an evolving balance of
power." O'Shaughnessy identifies [**threats to North America as [Russian
aircraft and surface ship incursions into the Arctic]{.mark}**, Russia's
development of hypersonic missiles tipped with both conventional and
nuclear warheads, and subsurface nuclear torpedoes]{.underline}. He
identifies **[[the most geographically vulnerable area]{.mark} as the
Canadian Arctic where Russian forces are active]{.underline}**.
[**[Vulnerable targets include the North American
economy]{.underline}**,]{.mark} in which communications networks, dams,
pipelines, power grids, and roads can be attacked. The General states
that [NORAD is evaluating new ways to counter North American
threats]{.underline}.37 More recently, the General [affirms that
[**Canada and the US have lost their military advantage over Russia** in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as **[Russia has been expanding its
capabilities in the region, including air, maritime, and land platforms
for delivering strategic weapons,]{.underline}** such as advanced cruise
missiles. He states that "[in order [to reclaim]{.mark} our strategic
[advantage]{.mark} in the high North, **[it is critical]{.mark} that [we
improve our ability to detect and track surface vessels and
aircraft]{.mark}**]{.underline} in our Arctic approaches and establish
more reliable secure communications ... in the higher latitudes" through
a network of space-based and underwater sensors linked with [traditional
radar systems]{.underline}. In order to improve the ability to monitor
activities in the North, the General promotes the Joint All Domain C2
(JADC2) concept through NORAD and USNORTHCOM -- [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
joint [[capability necessary for]{.underline}]{.mark} homeland
[[defence]{.underline}]{.mark} to provide domain awareness in real time
[[to sense]{.underline}]{.mark} incoming [[ballistic
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} and new hypersonic glide vehicles and
cruise missiles. This program intends to link sensors with shooters; and
use predictive analysis to advise decisionmakers facing complex
decisions on the consequences or outcomes "at the speed of relevance."
39 General O'Shaughnessy's recommended responses to the growing threat
is part of Canadian and American efforts to close the gap in
capabilities to detect, deter, and defend against new threats to North
America. Charron and Fergusson address the challenges of the
modernization and evolution of North American defence,40 which has
implications for Canada's future participation in missile defence.
Explored within the framework of the evolution of North American defence
(EvoNAD) the binational Canada-US command NORAD evaluates the long-term
implications of strategic developments.41 Charron states that "At
EvoNAD's core is the examination of [[immediate]{.underline}]{.mark} and
future [[threats to North America and the utility
of]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[defence structures and capabilities to
meet them]{.underline}]{.mark}."42 This process requires a re-evaluation
of requirements to counter threats emerging in multiple domains in
conjunction with revisions to Canada-US defence cooperation. The defence
of the US involves the defence and security of Canada due to its
geographical location at the top of the North American continent,
bordering the Arctic from which [aerial, ballistic, and maritime threats
may arrive via the Arctic, Pacific, and Atlantic]{.underline} Oceans.
Charron predicts greater Canada-US cooperation in the current and
evolving context and suggests "the functional demands of this new threat
environment could lead to NORAD's ultimate transformation into an
integrated, multi-domain and dimensional North American Defense Command
solution."43 Canada's defence policy outlined in the 2017 White Paper
Strong, Secure, Engaged does not discuss missile defence, but it does
address new threats and challenges in the North American and Arctic
context, the importance of the binational command NORAD and its need to
evolve with the threat, in addition to upgrading the North Warning
System.44 However SSE is silent on allocating funds to some of these
initiatives. Fergusson notes that the Canadian public is "largely
uninformed and disinterested" on NORAD modernization and the North
Warning System, while the Trudeau government remains silent on the
issue.

## BMD/Golden Dome Uq 

### Golden Dome Good/BMD Uq

#### The Golden Dome is key to maintain deterrence and defense, and to check back against nuclear adversaries. 

**Payne 6/18**, co-founder of the National Institute for Public Policy,
Professor Emeritus at the Graduate School of Defense and Strategic
Studies, (Dr. Keith b. Payne, June 18^th^, 2025, "Why Does America Need
Golden Dome?", Real Clear Defense,
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2025/06/18/why_does_america_need_golden_dome_1117261.html)

President Trump's January 27, 2025 Executive Order, [The [Iron Dome for
America]{.mark},]{.underline} calls for [a [versatile]{.mark} U.S.
[missile defense]{.mark} system [to protect America']{.mark}s citizens,
territory, infrastructure, and military forces [against]{.mark} all
opponents' "[ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise
missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}, and other advanced aerial attacks."\[1\]
It also calls for the examination of cooperation with allies to protect
their territories, populations and military forces. This is a sweeping
directive for the defense of the United States the likes of which have
not been seen since Ronald Reagan's 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative.
That [[r]{.mark}esearch [and d]{.mark}evelopment program ultimately [led
to]{.mark} the [rudimentary]{.mark} U.S. homeland [defense]{.mark}
system now [deployed]{.mark} to protect [against No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea'[s long-range ballistic missiles, but not]{.mark} against
[Russian or Chinese missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The goal of defending American citizens, infrastructure and nuclear
forces may seem self-evidently sensible. That, however, is a naïve view
given long-standing U.S. missile defense policy. Since 1976, no
Republican or Democratic administration has deployed missile defenses to
ease or even challenge the condition of homeland vulnerability to
Russian or Chinese strategic missiles. Americans typically react to this
harsh reality with shocked disbelief;\[2\] why else should U.S.
taxpayers spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense every year if
not---at a minimum---to protect the country from attack?

[Washington's [archaic policy against deploying anything beyond]{.mark}
a [minimalist]{.mark} homeland [defense]{.mark} against North Korean
missiles [is dangerous given]{.mark} the [looming]{.mark} nuclear
[threats of a Russian, Chinese, and No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean "[axis
of upheaval]{.mark}"]{.underline} that has the clear goal of
overthrowing the liberal world order, by force if necessary. Russia has
explicitly lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons and
frequently issues coercive nuclear threats; China's leadership has
identified 2027 as a possible timeline for taking Taiwan,\[3\] and has
not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons to do so, if necessary. Both
have been engaged in an extensive expansion of their nuclear forces for
well over a decade.

Republican and Democratic administrations foolishly expected the
post-Cold War international system to be a cooperative "new world
order,"\[4\] governed by a near-universal liberal enlightenment. To the
dismay of Western capitals, Russia, China, and North Korea (and Iran)
instead see themselves at war with the United States because it is the
impediment to their common goal. Washington and the West are only now
awakening to the harsh reality of this war.

An American homeland defense against all opponents' missiles, now
labeled ["[Golden Dome]{.mark}" by the Trump Administration,\[5[\]
is]{.mark} an [urgent step]{.mark} Washington must take [to strengthen
deterrence]{.mark} and, concurrently, to [prepare for]{.mark} [the
possibility that deterrence will fail]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., both
to prevent war and prepare for the possibility of war.

Golden Dome and the Deterrence of War

As described by the Executive Order and Pentagon, [[Golden Dome will
"progressively" protect]{.mark} U.S. [citizens]{.mark}, critical
[infra]{.mark}structure [and nuc]{.mark}lear
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[6[\]]{.underline} No one should
expect Golden Dome to emerge fully mature to defend against all
opponents' missiles. But [moving progressively]{.underline} to protect
citizens, infrastructure and nuclear forces [will help [preserve]{.mark}
the [credibility of U.S. deterrence]{.mark} strategies that must serve
to keep the peace.]{.underline} The more effectively the United States
provides this protection, the more able it will be to deter war. How so?

First, a basic necessity for deterrence is that U.S. nuclear forces and
infrastructure are able to survive any nuclear first strike intended to
destroy them; they must be able to pose an enduring threat of
retaliation. Golden Dome's protection of U.S. nuclear forces and
infrastructure may become increasingly key for the fundamental
requirement that U.S. forces be survivable. As Russian and Chinese
long-range nuclear missile capabilities continue to expand, and Moscow
and Beijing increasingly coordinate and cooperate, the potential nuclear
strike threat to eliminate U.S. retaliatory deterrence capabilities will
become severe, and the active defense of those U.S. capabilities may be
essential for their survival and capacity to pose a retaliatory threat.

More specifically, also necessary for deterrence is the U.S. capability
to "tailor" deterrence by holding at risk those particular assets that
opponents value most.\[7\] [[Golden Dome]{.mark}'s potential [protection
of ]{.mark}]{.underline}U.S. [[ICBMs and nuc]{.mark}lear
[infra]{.mark}structure will [help]{.mark} [preserve]{.mark} the U.S.
[capability to threaten]{.mark} the many hardened and underground
military and political sites that likely constitute the highest values
of Russia's, China's and North Korea's [autocratic]{.mark}
[rulers]{.mark}]{.underline}---their "tools of power and control."\[8\]
The need for such a deterrent capability against Moscow was recognized
as far back as 1983 by the bipartisan President's Commission on
Strategic Forces. Its report concluded that, for deterrence, the United
States "...must be able to put at risk those types of Soviet
targets---including hardened ones such as military command bunkers and
facilities, missile silos, nuclear weapons and other storage, and the
rest---which the Soviet leaders have given every indication by their
actions they value most and which constitute their tools of power and
control."\[9\] This basic deterrence principle almost certainly applies
to today's autocratic rulers. [[Golden Dome]{.mark}'s unique
[protection]{.mark} of the specific U.S. capabilities needed to pose
such a deterrent threat, and thereby tailor deterrence to contemporary
autocratic foes, [is]{.mark} likely to become [key to preventing great
power war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Second, [Russian and Chinese]{.mark} regional "[theories of
victory]{.mark}" over U.S. allies and partners [include coercive]{.mark}
nuclear [threats]{.mark} to America intended to destroy the U.S. will to
act in defense of allies]{.underline}, and thus the credibility of U.S.
deterrence commitments.\[10\] [The priority [goal is to paralyze]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} leaders [with fear]{.mark}]{.underline} of Russian and/or
Chinese nuclear escalation or, if necessary, to destroy the U.S.
military infrastructure needed for U.S. power projection abroad---either
way leaving U.S. allies without American support and highly vulnerable
to defeat. The 1962 Cuban Missile crisis and the contemporary war in
Ukraine both demonstrate U.S. leaders' understandable fear of nuclear
escalation against U.S. territory,\[11\] and the potential effectiveness
of opponents' coercive nuclear threat strategies. U.S. leaders,
Republican and Democrat, have repeatedly expressed the fear of
escalation as their reason for great caution with regard to support for
Ukraine. As Russia and China expand their cooperation "without limits,"
[[protecting U.S.]{.mark} citizens and military infrastructure
[against]{.mark} Russian and Chinese [coercive]{.mark} nuclear
[threats]{.mark} intended to destroy U.S. will and power projection
capabilities will become [increasingly critical]{.mark}]{.underline} for
the credibility of America's extended deterrence "umbrella" for allies.

Russian and Chinese commentators have charged that America's Golden Dome
will upset deterrence "stability" and must be rejected. However, [the
fact that both [Moscow and Beijing]{.mark} have [long pursued]{.mark}
their own [missile defense shields]{.mark} and, in fact, that Russia has
a long-standing nuclear-armed national missile defense system, shows
their [criticism of]{.mark} [Golden Dome]{.mark} to be agitprop
[intended to stop]{.mark} an [American defensive program that
]{.mark}]{.underline}threatens to [[strengthen]{.mark} U.S.
[deterrence]{.mark} capabilities [against]{.mark} their respective
[theories of victory.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Golden Dome and BMD capabilities are increasing now, a key piece of the Golden dome has just completed a successful first test.

https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2025/06/key-golden-dome-component-tracks-missile-target-in-first-test.html)

[In a [first]{.mark} for a [key element]{.mark} of the nation's
ballistic missile defense system, a [long-range radar]{.mark} has
[acquired]{.mark}, [tracked and reported missile]{.mark} target
data,]{.underline} according to the Missile Defense Agency.

Monday, [a [target]{.mark} developed by MDA [was]{.mark}
air-[launched]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the [northern Pacific]{.mark} Ocean
off the southern coast of Alaska, where it was [tracked by]{.mark} the
[L]{.mark}ong [R]{.mark}ange [D]{.mark}iscrimination [R]{.mark}adar
[and]{.mark} the [Upgraded Early]{.mark} [Warning
Radar]{.mark}]{.underline} at Clear Space Force Station. Sensor data was
passed to the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) to support a
simulated engagement, the agency said in a news release.

MDA Director Lt. Gen. Heath Collins described it as a key test in the
development and integration of the LRDR system.

"[[LRDR]{.mark} will [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} USNORTHCOM and the
United States Space Force [with the [ability to precisely track]{.mark}
ballistic missile [threats]{.mark} as well as other space objects,
[advancing]{.mark} our [ability to deter adversaries]{.mark} and
[bolster]{.mark} our homeland missile [defense]{.mark},]{.underline}"
Collins said.

The agency said early data indicates the LRDR and GMD, "met mission
requirements."

[It was the [first test of]{.mark}]{.underline} Lockheed-Martin's Long
Range Discrimination Radar, [a [key element of]{.mark} President Donald
Trump's vision for a "[Golden Dome]{.mark} for America" missile
shield.]{.underline} The test had been put off twice since 2022 due to
developmental and supply problems stemming from the coronavirus pandemic
as well as anomalies with the target, according to Breaking Defense.

["[This]{.mark} technical [advancement]{.mark} will significantly
[bolster]{.mark} our nation's [deterrenc]{.mark}e capabilities,
p[rovidin]{.mark}g a [game-changing asset]{.mark} for homeland
defense,"]{.underline} Rick Cordaro, vice president of Lockheed Martin's
Radar and Sensor Systems, said in a news release.

[The test was also a [validation for]{.mark} the Boeing-made
[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]{.mark},]{.underline} designed to
detect, intercept and destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[The
test confirmed]{.mark} the LRDR's [sensors]{.mark} can [gather data from
longer distances than previously tested]{.mark}, [enhancing]{.mark}
threat [detection and response time]{.mark} for the GMD and other
missile defense systems,]{.underline} Boeing said in a news release.

"[This was a significant step forward in strengthening our nation's
defenses,"]{.underline} said Ted Kerzie, executive director of Boeing
Strategic Missile & Defense Systems. "[This [latest test
underscores]{.mark} our [ongoing]{.mark} [dedication to
enhancing]{.mark} America's layered missile [defense]{.mark}

#### The proposed Golden Dome would be incredibly effective, protecting America from nearly 100% of missiles, and more importantly, achieve deterrence\-\--Boyd 25 **(Director of the Center for National Security Initiatives and Professor of Aerospace Engineering Sciences, University if Colorado Boulder, Iain Boyd, May 28, 2025, "Golden Dome: An explanation of the proposed US missile defense system", Aerospace Testing International, https://www.aerospacetestinginternational.com/opinion/golden-dome-an-aerospace-engineer-explains-the-proposed-us-wide-missile-defense-system.html)**

Why does the United States need a missile shield? [Several countries,
including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, have been developing
missiles over the past few years that challenge the United States'
current missile defense systems. These weapons include updated ballistic
missiles and cruise missiles, and new hypersonic [missiles]{.mark}. They
[have been]{.mark} specifically [developed to counter America]{.mark}'s
highly advanced missile defense systems]{.underline} such as the Patriot
and the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System. For example,
the new hypersonic missiles are very high speed, operate in a region of
the atmosphere where nothing else flies and are maneuverable. All of
[these aspects combined create a new challenge [that requires a
new]{.mark}, updated [defensive approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia
has fired hypersonic missiles against Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.
China parades its new hypersonic missiles in Tiananmen Square. So it's
reasonable to think that, [to ensure the protection of its homeland and
to aid its allies, the U.S. may need a new missile (defense
capability]{.underline}. Ukrainian forces are using the U.S.-made
Patriot missile defense system against Russian ballistic missiles. What
are the components of a national missile defense system? Such a defense
system requires a global array of geographically distributed sensors
that cover all phases of all missile trajectories. [First, it is
essential for the system to detect the missile threats as early as
possible after launch, so some of the sensors must be located close to
regions where adversaries may fire them]{.underline}, such as by China,
Russia, North Korea and Iran. Then, it has to track the missiles along
their trajectories as they travel hundreds or thousands of miles. [These
requirements are met by deploying a variety of sensors on a number of
different platforms on the ground, at sea, in the air and in space.
Interceptors are placed in locations that protect vital U.S. assets and
usually aim to engage threats during the middle portion of the
trajectory between launch and the terminal dive]{.underline}. The U.S.
already has a broad array of sensors and interceptors in place around
the world and in space primarily to protect the U.S. and its allies from
ballistic missiles. The sensors would need to be expanded, including
with more space-based sensors, to detect new missiles such as hypersonic
missiles. The interceptors would need to be enhanced to enable them to
address hypersonic weapons and other missiles and warheads that can
maneuver. Does this technology exist? Intercepting hypersonic missiles
specifically involves several steps. First, as explained above, [a
hostile missile must be detected and identified as a
threat]{.underline}. Second, [the threat must be tracked along all of
its trajectory]{.underline} due to the ability of hypersonic missiles to
maneuver. Third, [an interceptor missile must be able to follow the
threat and get close enough to it to disable or destroy it]{.underline}.
The main new challenge here is the ability to track the hypersonic
missile continuously. This requires new types of sensors to detect
hypersonic vehicles and new sensor platforms that are able to provide a
complete picture of the hypersonic trajectory. As described, Golden Dome
would use the sensors in a layered approach in which they are installed
on a variety of platforms in multiple domains, including ground, sea,
air and space. These various platforms would need to have different
types of sensors that are specifically designed to track hypersonic
threats in different phases of their flight paths. These defensive
systems will also be designed to address weapons fired from space. Much
of the infrastructure will be multipurpose and able to defend against a
variety of missile types. In terms of time frame for deployment, it is
important to note that Golden Dome will build from the long legacy of
existing U.S. missile defense systems. Another important aspect of
Golden Dome is that some of the new capabilities have been under active
development for years. In some ways[, [Golden Dome represents the
commitment to]{.underline}]{.mark} [actually [deploy systems]{.mark} for
which considerable progress has already been made]{.underline}. Is near
100% protection a realistic claim? Israel's Iron Dome air defense system
has been described as the most effective system of its kind anywhere in
the world. But even Iron Dome is not 100% effective, and it has also
been overwhelmed on occasion by Hamas and others who fire very large
numbers of inexpensive missiles and rockets at it. So it is unlikely
that any missile defense system will ever provide 100% protection[. The
more important goal here is to achieve deterrence]{.underline}, similar
to the stalemate in the Cold War with the Soviet Union that was based on
nuclear weapons. All of the new weapons that Golden Dome will defend
against are very expensive. [The U.S. is trying to change the calculus
in an [opponent']{.mark}s thinking to the point where they [will
consider it not worth shooting]{.mark} their precious high-value
missiles at the U.S. when they know there is a high probability of them
not reaching their targets]{.underline}. CBS News covered President
Donald Trump's announcement. Is three years a feasible time frame? [That
seems to me like a very aggressive timeline, but with multiple countries
now operating hypersonic missiles[, there is]{.mark} a real sense of
[urgency]{.mark}]{.underline}. Existing missile defense systems on the
ground, at sea and in the air can be expanded to include new, more
capable sensors. Satellite systems are beginning to be put in place for
the space layer. Sensors have been developed to track the new missile
threats. Putting all of this highly complex system together, however, is
likely to take more than three years. At the same time[, if the U.S.
fully commits to Golden Dome, a significant amount of progress can be
made in this time.]{.underline} What does the president's funding
request tell you? President Trump is requesting a total budget for all
defense spending of about \$1 trillion in 2026. So, \$25 billion to
launch Golden Dome would represent only 2.5% of the total requested
defense budget. Of course, that is still a lot of money, and a lot of
other programs will need to be terminated to make it possible. But it is
certainly financially achievable. How will Golden Dome differ from Iron
Dome? Similar to Iron Dome, [Golden Dome will consist of sensors and
interceptor missiles but will be deployed over a much wider geographical
region and for defense against a broader variety of threats in
comparison with Iron Dome.]{.underline} A second-generation Golden Dome
system in the future would likely use directed energy weapons such as
high-energy lasers and high-power microwaves to destroy missiles. This
approach would significantly increase the number of shots that defenders
can take against ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missiles.The

storage, and the rest---which the Soviet leaders have given every
indication by their actions they value most and which constitute their
tools of power and control."\[9\] This basic deterrence principle almost
certainly applies to today's autocratic rulers. [[Golden Dome]{.mark}'s
unique protection of the specific U.S. capabilities needed to pose such
a deterrent threat]{.underline}, and thereby tailor deterrence to
contemporary autocratic foes, [is likely to become [key to
preventing]{.mark} great power [war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second,
Russian and Chinese regional "theories of victory" over U.S. allies and
partners include coercive nuclear threats to America intended to destroy
the U.S. will to act in defense of allies, and thus the credibility of
U.S. deterrence commitments.\[10\] The priority goal is to paralyze U.S.
leaders with fear of Russian and/or Chinese nuclear escalation or, if
necessary, to destroy the U.S. military infrastructure needed for U.S.
power projection abroad---either way leaving U.S. allies without
American support and highly vulnerable to defeat. The 1962 Cuban Missile
crisis and the contemporary war in Ukraine both demonstrate U.S.
leaders' understandable fear of nuclear escalation against U.S.
territory,\[11\] and the potential effectiveness of opponents' coercive
nuclear threat strategies. U.S. leaders, Republican and Democrat, have
repeatedly expressed the fear of escalation as their reason for great
caution with regard to support for Ukraine. As Russia and China expand
their cooperation "without limits," protecting U.S. citizens and
military infrastructure against Russian and Chinese coercive nuclear
threats intended to destroy U.S. will and power projection capabilities
will become increasingly critical for the credibility of America's
extended deterrence "umbrella" for allies. Russian and Chinese
commentators have charged that America's Golden Dome will upset
deterrence "stability" and must be rejected. However, the fact that both
Moscow and Beijing have long pursued their own missile defense shields
and, in fact, that Russia has a long-standing nuclear-armed national
missile defense system, shows their criticism of Golden Dome to be
agitprop intended to stop an American defensive program that threatens
to strengthen U.S. deterrence capabilities against their respective
theories of victory. Golden Dome and Preparation for Conflict
[Deterrence has long been the primary goal of U.S. nuclear policy and
strategic forces]{.underline}. However, the increasing potential for
deterrence failure or irrelevance is likely given multiple, dedicated
opponents who are willing to risk military conflict, emphasize the role
of nuclear weapons, and have the common goal of overturning the existing
global order. Nuclear escalation in a regional conflict is perhaps most
likely. This is an unprecedented threat context in which the [United
States must prioritize both deterrence and the preparation for
deterrence failure]{.underline}. [In the event of war, Golden Dome's
defense of citizens, infrastructure and nuclear forces could uniquely
save lives, reduce damage and contribute to the resiliency of U.S.
military forces and operations]{.underline}. Deterrence must, of course,
remain a priority goal; but the preparation to defend in the event of
war also must be a priority. Fortunately, [[the more capable U.S.
defenses]{.mark} are in the event of war, [the more likely Washington
will be able to deter war]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are no trade-offs
in this regard.

#### Ballistic Missile defense strong

Since programs were first launched in the 1950s to build systems capable
of intercepting incoming nuclear or conventional weapons, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [spent]{.mark} [more than \$400
billion]{.mark} [on]{.mark} various [missile defense]{.mark} programs[.
Despite]{.mark} decades of [research]{.mark}, development and testing,
[there remains no]{.mark} reliably [effective anti-missile system to
counter]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic missiles
[(ICBMs).]{.mark}]{.underline} Systems to counter shorter-range
missiles, such as the Patriot and THAAD missile defense programs, have
been more successful in tests, but their utility is limited to smaller,
regional coverage areas. In fact, the system designated to intercept
ICBMs, known as the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program, has
been unsuccessful in eight of its 19 tests. This failing test record is
exacerbated by the highly scripted conditions of the tests themselves.

#### Missile defense is key

Arsenal\", U.S. Naval Institute,
https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/october/strategic-shifts-require-reshaping-us-nuclear-arsenal//rz

[Today, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must deter]{.mark} two peer
nuclear powers---[Russia and China]{.mark}. Outlining]{.underline} the
new environment, Admiral Charles Richard, former commander, U.S.
Strategic Command, told Congress [that [neither]{.mark} Russia nor China
[has been slowing]{.mark} its [modernization programs]{.mark}; rather
[both have]{.mark} conducted an "[explosion of
capability]{.mark}."5 ]{.underline}

Over the past 20 years, [Russia has modernized its Soviet-era nuclear
arsenal with modern tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. Of these
weapons, only the strategic warheads were limited by the New START
treaty, resulting in [Russia stockpiling more than 2,000 tactical
nuclear weapons]{.mark}.6]{.underline} In 2017, Russian President
Vladimir [[Putin announced the introduction]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} air-launched ballistic missiles, hypersonic
glide vehicles, new heavy [intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBMs]{.mark}]{.underline}) capable of being armed with ten
independently targetable warheads, autonomous underwater vehicles,
nuclear-powered cruise missiles, rail launched ICBMs, and hypersonic
cruise missiles.^7^ Further, [Russia has abandoned its no-first-use
policy]{.underline} in favor of an escalate-to-deescalate
posture.^8^ This policy change has proven more destabilizing, with
direct threats from Russia that it "would [not hesitate to use tactical
nuclear weapons against NATO"]{.underline} and nuclear saber-rattling
during Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.^9^ These actions have
made the nuclear planning environment much more complicated for the U.S.
deterrent mission. 

While China's nuclear arsenal is still much smaller than that of the
United States, [evidence points to China conducting a rapid buildup of
forces]{.underline}. Brad Roberts told Congress in 2016 and 2017 that
President Xi Jinping promised China would conduct "a great rise in
strategic capabilities" and complete "breakthroughs . . . in strategic
deterrence capability."^10^ [[China is in a position]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
rapidly [build]{.mark} its stockpile [to levels equivalent]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} Some
estimates indicate China will achieve parity by 2035, which are
supported by its nuclear force buildup and modernization over the past
30 years.^11^ [The buildup and modernization include road-mobile
intermediate-range ballistic missiles and ICBMs; new silo fields with
approximately 250 new ICBM silos; 12 ballistic-missile submarines
(SSBNs), with plans to complete the next-generation submarine deterrent
by 2030,]{.underline} including modern SSBNs and improved SLBMs; and
modernization of its bombers.^12^ Along with Russia's actions, Beijing's
nuclear buildup threatens strategic stability for the United States and
its allies.

Compounding this threat environment, the United States faces significant
hurdles in delivering its current nuclear program because of aging
infrastructure, manpower shortages, loss of institutional knowledge, and
insufficient nuclear production capability. These problems impede the
nation's capacity to fulfill current commitments and to evolve in
response to emerging threats. [[A comprehensive]{.mark} and
forward-looking [approach]{.mark}, integrating technological
advancements and strategic thinking, [will ensure the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [maintains a]{.mark} credible and effective [nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}.]{.underline} As former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
Army General Mark Milley stated, "We want to keep it a great power
competition, and not get into great power war. And the way to do that is
through deterrence."

#### America's adversaries are gaining trajectory on BMDs -- the US must develop a strategy.

**Peters 25** \[Senior Research Fellow for Strategic Deterrence (Robert
Peters, 3-11-25, "A Missile Defense Review for the United States," The
Heritage Foundation)
https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/missile-defense-review-the-united-states\]

[[America's adversaries]{.mark}---[particularly China, Iran, North
Korea, and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---are [[building more and more
diverse capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} that can target not only their
regional neighbors, some of whom are American allies, but the United
States itself. Such new weapons systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles ([ICBMs]{.underline}), [long-range cruise missiles,
hypersonic missiles]{.underline}, [and even orbital bombardment systems,
are [coupled with increasing attempts of coercion]{.mark}, particularly
against America's regional allies.]{.underline} This coercion sometimes
takes the form of attempted nuclear coercion as is the case with North
Korea against the American homeland as well as against U.S. allies in
the Pacific and Russia's regular threats of nuclear use against the U.S.
homeland and that of our allies in Europe. Other times, it takes the
form of outright attacks on civilian and military targets, evidenced by
the Iranian attacks on Israel and Russian attacks on Ukraine. Clearly,
[U.S. adversaries increasingly [see potential missile and autonomous
systems strikes]{.mark} on not only military targets, but also on
homelands and civilian population centers, as legitimate]{.underline}.
This is true not only for targets in the homelands of America's allies,
but for the United States as well. This development in adversary
perception is because America's adversaries see the U.S. homeland to be
not only a valid target, but a vulnerable one as well. This is why they
are building a growing array of long-range strike capabilities. Russia
has been interested in hypersonic capabilities since the 1980s. It
claims that the "Kinzhal"---which has seen service in the Ukraine
war---is a jet-launched hypersonic missile, while Moscow also claims
that its hypersonic glide vehicle "Avangard" is nuclear-capable. Moscow
also is pursuing a ship-based hypersonic cruise missile, the "Tsirkon."
In March 2024, reports suggested that Moscow once again was interested
in putting nuclear weapons in orbit---potentially as an antisatellite
weapon, but also potentially as a FOBS capability. [China, Iran, North
Korea, and Russia]{.underline} are [[challenging American
interests]{.mark} and [seeking to constrain American influence and
freedom of action around]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia is attempting to use nuclear
weapons to coerce the West due to its support for Ukraine and has hinted
at pursuing a low-escalation pathway attack on NATO states in pursuit of
such a goal. Other actors may also pursue a lower-escalation pathway
attack, as their missile forces expand and diversify. In a
lower-escalation pathway, an enemy would attack an American homeland
site, potentially including military assets, with a limited number of
conventional or low-yield nuclear weapons, limiting civilian casualties,
in an attempt to change the behavior of the United States. In a
low-escalation pathway attack, China or Russia may try to escalate its
way out of a conventional conflict it is losing against the United
States by conducting a series of limited conventional or nuclear strikes
at key targets in the U.S. homeland. These coercive strikes would be
intended to demonstrate enough resolve and result in significant damage
to convince U.S. political leaders to give in to adversary demands but
limited enough in scope and scale (meaning not catastrophic) to not
prompt an overwhelming U.S. response. This lower-escalatory pathway of
forcing a nation to negotiate has not been tested, but the logic is
sound, and there is some indication that America's adversaries are
considering such a strike. China is building a nuclear arsenal that in
the coming years could enable it to carry out such a strike, and Russia
openly discusses the prospects of limited nuclear strikes against
targets in the West. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [existing
approach to missile defense]{.mark}, as [enacted]{.mark} through the
Missile Defense Agency, is [not comprehensive]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
cannot address lower-escalation coercive attacks from China or Russia or
compete with China's pacing challenge due to the limited nature of the
existing missile defense posture or capacity. According to the DOD's
2023 annual report, *Military and Security Developments Involving the
People's Republic of China*: [The United States [requires]{.mark} a
comprehensive [set of missile defense layers to counter]{.mark} an
[adversary's lower-escalation temptation]{.mark}.]{.underline} A set of
comprehensive missile defense layers that can destroy at least a hundred
adversary nuclear-armed missiles---be they from China, North Korea, or
Russia---would incentivize these adversaries' leaders to abandon plans
for "easy coercion" or "cheap shot" attempts with a few missiles to
coerce or intimidate American political leaders. Forcing adversary
leaders to consider the lower likelihood of success for attacks below
100 missiles, in addition to the potential for provoking an unacceptably
damaging U.S. response, will help to improve deterrence and raise the
threshold for missile-based strikes against the U.S. homeland. Making
escalation more difficult and riskier to achieve lowers the risk that
adversaries will see value in escalation. While adversaries might be
tempted to execute a lower-escalation pathway strike (say, firing only a
dozen nuclear-armed missiles at the American homeland) as a high-risk
but potentially high-reward strategy to end a conflict on terms
acceptable to them, they would be far more cautious about firing more
than a hundred nuclear-armed missiles at the United States. Such a
strike would almost certainly trigger the kind of massive nuclear
retaliation by the United States that they would otherwise try to avoid,
in addition to the uncertainty of success for the initial attack. [In
this way, a credible and effective multilayered missile defense
architecture could deter America's adversaries from pursuing an
otherwise attractive lower-escalation]{.underline} pathway in the near
future. Indeed, the existing Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) architecture
first fielded in 2004---designed to defend against limited attacks from
North Korea---may no longer be sufficient to defend against even a rogue
state attack, given the expansion and maturation of North Korea's
missile program. To put another way, effective and credible missile
defenses are not a "future like to have"---they are a "near term must
have." The [United States maintains credible nuclear capabilities and
highly lethal]{.underline}, [[battle-proven conventional capabilities
that give its adversaries pause, deter aggression, assure its allies,
and defeat threats should deterrence fail]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
credible, integrated, and multilayered missile defense architecture is a
strategic imperative on par with maintaining a credible and diverse
nuclear arsenal, particularly in an era when America's adversaries are
developing, deploying, and employing ever-more capable and lethal
missile threats. Indeed, adversaries may grow more desperate over a
prolonged conventional conflict with a superpower like the United
States, leading them to take riskier strategies like conventional or
even nuclear strikes on the U.S. homeland and its critical
infrastructure. To counter this threat, the United States should deploy
IAMD systems that can deter and defeat such coercive attacks over a
protracted conflict and be prepared to defeat multiple salvos conducted
over extended periods of time. Indeed, it is likely to strain
credibility to have defenses that can defeat a single salvo of attack. A
credible missile defense architecture must be able to defeat (or seem to
be able to defeat) multiple waves of attacks during a protracted
conflict. There are three possible ways in which the United States can
respond to its adversaries' long-range missile threats---be they
lower-escalation pathway strikes, repeated salvos on the American
homeland during a protracted conflict, or even larger-scale strategic
attacks---to its allies and the American homeland. Washington can (1)
acquiesce to the wishes of U.S. adversaries and accept a fragmented
NATO, reduced American global influence, and limits to its ability to
project power; (2) rely solely on the threat of punishment to deter a
growing list of ever-more capable adversaries from striking civilian
population centers; or (3) build effective missile defenses to deny U.S.
adversaries the ability to coerce the United States or its allies.
[[Given]{.mark} the [emerging threats and]{.mark} the [apparent desire
for America's adversaries]{.mark} to field an arsenal of ICBMs,
long-range cruise missiles, hypersonic capabilities, and
FOBS]{.underline}---many of which are optimized to overwhelm or evade
U.S. missile defenses---[the United States must, can, and will build an
integrated, multilayered missile defense architecture that can
deter]{.underline} and [[defeat coercive strikes on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[homeland]{.underline}]{.mark} [[while]{.mark} also
[providing]{.mark} a [regional defense of key capabilities
overseas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, an integrated missile defense
architecture that incorporates existing homeland missile defenses, to
include existing GBIs and regional missile defenses in the
Indo--Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, and builds additional
capacity and capabilities in several key areas is required given the
expanding threats. Such a missile defense architecture must perform a
number of functions, including: [Defending the homeland. The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must ensure]{.mark} that its
[population centers and critical locations]{.mark} are [protected and
preserved]{.mark}. Defending key overseas nodes. Such nodes could be key
bases, logistical sites, or allied population centers.
[Defending]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its [allies against a
variety of inbound threats.]{.mark} Typically, the United States has
focused its missile defense on intercepting ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles overseas, and ballistic missiles at home.]{.underline}
Given the evolving nature of the threat, the United States should field
the capabilities necessary to defeat all nature of inbound threats, to
include long-range cruise missiles, hypersonic threats, and those
delivered from orbit. [Defending the U.S. and its allies against a
variety of actors.]{.underline}

Congress has appropriated over \$250 billion for the Missile Defense
Agency's programs between fiscal years 1985 and 2023, according to
calculations by ACA based on Missile Defense Agency (MDA)
[estimates](https://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/FY17_histfunds.pdf)
and the legislative record. That total does not include spending by the
military services on programs such as the Patriot system or the many
[additional tens of billions of
dollars](https://sgs.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/2021-11/vonhippel-2021-BMD.pdf)
spent since work on anti-missile systems first began in the 1950s. [[For

the [[homeland against]{.underline}]{.mark} limited [[long-range missile
strikes from states]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Iran and North Korea,
but not major nuclear powers like Russia and China as that mission would
pose significant technical, financial, and geopolitical challenges. The
United States has also pursued programs to defend U.S. troops and
facilities abroad, as well as some close allies, from attacks by
ballistic missiles---and to a much lesser extent cruise missiles. The
overall U.S. missile defense effort enjoys strong bipartisan support in
Congress. Additionally, many U.S. allies place a high value on missile
defense cooperation with the United States. However, the U.S. pursuit of
effective missile defenses has been accompanied by intense debate about
the technical capabilities of the system and realism of testing, the
scope of the ballistic missile threat, the deterrence and assurance
benefits of defenses, the cost-effectiveness of shooting down relatively
inexpensive offensive missiles with expensive defensive ones, and the
repercussions for U.S. strategic stability with Russia and China.
According to the Defense Department's [independent testing
office](https://www.dote.osd.mil/Portals/97/pub/reports/FY2023/other/2023mds.pdf?ver=veBN85QR2LHbgJKPoclMwQ%3d%3d),
existing U.S. missile defenses have \"demonstrated capability\" to
defend the U.S. homeland against a small number of intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) threats that employ \"simple countermeasures.\"
The testing office assesses that defenses to protect allies and U.S.
troops deployed abroad possess a capability to defend against small
numbers of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and
medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs). The capability of defenses
against short-range ballistic missiles is limited to the threat posed by
a "representative raid." Until recently, the only U.S. BMD system to
ever be used in combat was the point-defense Patriot system. In April
2024, U.S. Navy ships in the Middle East equipped with the Aegis BMD
system

the ambitions of U.S. missile defense policy have expanded while funding
has remained roughly flat at approximately \$10 billion in Congressional
appropriations each fiscal year. The Trump administration's 2019 Missile
Defense Review argued the need for an improved capability to intercept
cruise and hypersonic missiles, including long-range strikes targeting
the continental United States. The Biden administration's 2022 Missile
Defense Review acknowledged these concerns. The Missile Defense Agency
is managing several new programs to improve hypersonic missile defense,
such as the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor and the
Glide-Phase Interceptor. U.S. Northern Command and the MDA have done
limited tests and studies on improving homeland defense against cruise
missiles. Other aspects of the Trump administration's missile defense
policy have been set aside by the Biden administration's 2022 review,
however. These include endorsements of boost-phase interceptors,
space-based interceptors, and adapting the sea-based Aegis missile
defense system for homeland defense. In 2020, the Department of Defense
conducted a test of an Aegis SM-3 Block IIA interceptor against an
ICBM-class target. The 2022 Missile Defense Review restated the
[[traditional U.S. policy]{.underline}]{.mark} that Ground Mid-Course
Defense (GMD) is "[[neither intended nor capable of
defeating]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[missile capabilities of Russia and

[Interceptors]{.underline}

[Interceptors are one major component of the U.S. missile defense
system. Different types of interceptors that respond to different
missile threats have been emphasized over the years, and the composition
of today's U.S. missile defense reflects these choices.]{.underline}
While the United States is working to improve its ability to strike down
cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles, its fully operational
missile defense systems are best suited to the interception of ballistic
missiles. Missile defense interceptors can potentially intercept
ballistic missiles in three different phases of flight. [The boost
phase]{.underline} extends from the time a missile is launched from its
platform until its engines stop thrusting. [The midcourse phase
is]{.underline} the longest and thus offers an optimal opportunity to
intercept an incoming threat and, depending on other circumstances like
the trajectory of the incoming threat and quality of U.S. tracking data,
enables more shots if the first intercept attempt fails. [The terminal
phase,]{.underline} typically less than one minute long, occurs as the
missile plummets through the atmosphere toward the target and offers a
very limited opportunity to intercept a ballistic missile threat.
Boost-Phase Interceptors. [The United States currently has no capability
to shoot down missiles in their boost phase]{.underline}.
Technologically, boost-phase intercept is the most challenging option
because of the very short time during which a missile is boosting, the
missile's extraordinary rate of acceleration during this brief window of
time, and the need to have the interceptor close to the launch site.29
This is also, however, the most beneficial time to strike. [A boosting
ballistic missile is at its slowest speed compared to other
phases]{.underline}; it is therefore not yet able to maneuver evasively
and has not yet deployed countermeasures or multiple warheads that
complicate the targeting and intercept problem. In the past, the United
States pursued several boost-phase programs, including the Airborne
Laser, the Network Centric Air Defense Element, the Kinetic Energy
Interceptor, and the Air Launched Hit-to-Kill missile. Eventually, each
of these programs was cancelled because of technical, operational, or
cost challenges, and other boost-phase programs have not progressed
significantly. Midcourse-Phase Interceptors. Intercepting missiles in
their midcourse phase offers more time for intercept attempts and
presents relatively fewer technological challenges than intercepts in
the boost phase present, but it also allows the missile time to deploy
decoys and countermeasures that can complicate interception by
overwhelming sensors and radars. [The United States deploys two systems
that can shoot down incoming missiles in the midcourse phase of flight:
The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system and The Aegis defense
system. The GMD system is the only operational system that is designed
to shoot down a long-range ballistic missile headed for the U.S.
homeland. It consists of 40 Ground-Based Interceptors
(GBIs)]{.underline} at Fort Greeley, Alaska, and four at Vandenberg Air
Force Base, California. A GBI consists of a multi-staged rocket booster
and an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) that intercepts the incoming
missile with hit-to-kill technology. In FY 2023, the MDA "increased US
Northern Command Ground Based Interceptor capacity in the most advanced
configuration with Capability Enhanced-II Block 1 Exo-atmospheric Kill
Vehicles integrated on new Configuration 2 boost vehicles."30 [To
increase the probability of an intercept, the United States can launch
multiple interceptors at each incoming ballistic missile]{.underline}.
At present, because the inventory of interceptors is limited, the United
States can intercept only a handful of ballistic missiles that have
relatively unsophisticated countermeasures. In 2017, Congress approved a
White House request to increase the number of GBIs from 44 to 64 to keep
up with the advancing ballistic missile threat, particularly from North
Korea.31 The MDA intended to produce a Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) to
top 20 additional GBIs that would fill the new silos, but this program
was canceled in 2019 because of technological difficulties.32 [The MDA
instead initiated the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program to build
an entirely new interceptor that would add both capacity and capability
to the GMD system. The MDA plans to field NGIs "no later than the end of
2028,"33]{.underline} and they could eventually replace some or all of
the existing 44 GBIs. [Unlike the GBIs, the NGIs will feature multiple
kill vehicles, giving a single NGI multiple opportunities to intercept
an incoming threat.34]{.underline} Contracts to develop the NGI were
awarded to Lockheed Martin and a Northrop Grumman--Raytheon team in
March 2021.35 The FY 2024 presidential budget request includes \$2.1
billion for NGI to support these two competing contracts.36 [The Aegis
defense system is a sea-based component of the U.S. missile defense
system. It is designed to address the threat of short-range,
medium-range (1,000--3,000 kilometers), and intermediate-range
(3,000--5,500 kilometers) ballistic missiles.]{.underline} It utilizes
different versions of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) and SM-6 depending
on the threat and other considerations like ship location and quality of
tracking data[. The Aegis system also has capability against aerial
threats (aircraft and unmanned aerial systems) and cruise
missiles.37]{.underline} According to the FY 2024 MDA budget submission,
"\[b\]y the end of FY 2024, there will be 53 total BMD capable ships
requiring maintenance support."38 Japan has several Aegis BMD-capable
destroyers and cooperated with the United States to develop the latest
SM-3 missile, the SM-3 Block IIA.39 [The United States also deploys a
land-based version of Aegis]{.underline}, the Aegis Ashore system, in
Romania and another in Poland. The site in Poland experienced repeated
delays in achieving initial operational capability but "is expected to
be delivered" in FY 2023.40 Aegis Ashore sites relieve some of the
requirements on the naval fleet because BMD-capable cruisers and
destroyers are multi-mission and are used for other purposes, such as
wartime fleet operations and even anti-piracy operations. These Aegis
Ashore sites help to protect U.S. allies and forces in Europe from the
Iranian ballistic missile threat. [Aegis BMD will also play a
significant role in the development of a missile defense system on the
U.S. territory of Guam, one of the MDA's priorities in the FY 2024
budget request. Former Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command
(INDOPACOM) Admiral Philip Davidson has testified that "the most
important action we can take to increase the joint force's lethality
\[in the region\] is to introduce a 360-degree, persistent, air and
missile defense capability on Guam (Guam Defense System (GDS))."41
Current INDOPACOM Commander Admiral John Aquilino testified in March
2022 that "Guam's strategic importance is difficult to overstate" and
emphasized "the importance of the island for sustaining the joint force
as our main operating base and home to 130,000 Americans."42 The FY 2024
budget request includes a total of \$1.5 billion to continue development
of an architecture for Guam defense and to begin procurement of needed
components, including SM-3, SM-6, and Aegis fire control components.43
In November 2020, the U.S. Navy and the MDA shot down an ICBM-type
target using the SM-3 Block IIA]{.underline}.44 The test, FTM-44, was
the first step in a plan to use SM-3 Block IIAs as an "underlay" to the
GMD system to defend the homeland with GBIs taking the first shots at an
incoming target and SM-3 interceptors taking shots if the GBIs miss.45
The MDA had planned to test the SM-3 IIA against a more sophisticated
ICBM countermeasure set as the next step, but the budget request for FY
2023 eliminated funds to pursue the SM-3 IIA as a homeland underlay.46
According to the Government Accountability Office, the MDA "did not
complete its fiscal year 2022 flight, ground, and cyber baseline test
program" and did not meet its annual goals for fielding the systems,
leaving the warfighter with "less fielded capability than planned."47
[Terminal-Phase Interceptors. The United States currently deploys three
terminal-phase missile defense systems: Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD); The Patriot missile defense system; and Aegis BMD. A
THAAD battery can "intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or
outside the atmosphere during their final, or terminal, phase of
flight"48]{.underline} and consists of a launcher, interceptors, the
Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2
(AN/TPY-2) radar, and fire control.49 The system is transportable and
rapidly deployable. THAAD batteries have been deployed to such countries
as Japan, South Korea, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and
the U.S. signed a deal in 2020 to deliver THAAD to Saudi Arabia.50 In
February 2022, THAAD was "employed successfully by the UAE in the first
two combat employments of that system."51 [Patriot is an air-defense and
short-range ballistic missile defense system]{.underline}. A battery
includes a launcher, interceptors, AN/MPQ-53/65 radar, an engagement
control station, and diesel-powered generator units. The Patriot family
of missile defense interceptors has been upgraded over time from the
initial Patriot Advanced Capability-1 (PAC-1) deployed in Europe in 1988
to the PAC-3 configuration deployed around the world today. The most
recent Patriot upgrade, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement, "expands
the lethal battlespace with a two-pulse solid rocket motor."52 The
system is transportable and "is currently deployed in multiple theaters
around the world with daily operational activities."53 Particularly
notable is the system's combat performance in Ukraine, where it has
intercepted Russian Kinzhal hypersonic missiles among others.54 To
increase the defended battlespace, the MDA is pursuing the Patriot
Launch-on-Remote (THAAD) capability, which integrates the PAC-3 and
THAAD systems by enabling a PAC-3 interceptor to utilize targeting data
from a THAAD AN/TPY-2 radar. Launch-on-Remote is a significant
capability that can increase the defended area by spreading out
missiles.55 [After two failed tests in 2020, the MDA, in conjunction
with the Army, conducted two successful tests early in
2022]{.underline}.56 The MDA, in coordination with the Army, "will begin
global fielding this fiscal year."57 Progress on building a Guam defense
system has moved slowly despite the urgency of the Chinese threat.58
Even though this missile defense system first appeared on the INDOPACOM
Unfunded Priorities List in 2019, the President requested and Congress
first provided funding for the system only in FY 2022.59 The \$192
million that was appropriated fell far short of the \$350 million
requested by INDOPACOM for that year,60 but the FY 2024 budget request
includes \$1.5 billion to strengthen the island's missile defense.61
General VanHerck recently testified that he remains "confident in our
current capability to defend the homeland against a limited DPRK
\[Democratic People's Republic of Korea\] ballistic missile threat" but
is "concerned about future capacity and capability to respond to
advancing DPRK ballistic missile threats, making it crucial to field the
Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) as funded in the FY23 Consolidated
Appropriations Act (P.L. 117-328)."62 The first NGI flight tests are
scheduled for "the 2027 timeframe."63 NGI will add needed capacity and
capability to the GMD system, which some see as in danger of being
overwhelmed by the increasing capacity of North Korea's ballistic
missiles to strike the U.S. homeland and by North Korea's ability to
deploy countermeasures.64 The MDA and Congress also continue to support
a GMD service life extension program (SLEP) that is intended to maintain
the existing fleet through this decade and beyond 2030. Given that NGI
will not replace the existing GBI fleet---at least not initially---it is
critical that the existing interceptors remain in service. The GMD
system was largely built in the early 2000s, and many parts---including
the GBI kill vehicles, boosters, and ground systems---are subject to
degradation from aging. The MDA will need to consider additional NGI
purchases after the initial 20 to begin replacing existing GBIs in the
2030s. In 2019, to strengthen homeland missile defense after the RKV was
canceled and before NGI comes online, the Trump Administration proposed
the development of an underlay using SM-3 Block IIA and THAAD
interceptors. General VanHerck agreed that "an underlayer would give us
additional capacity and capability" to address threats to the
homeland.65 The MDA had progressed toward this underlay after its
successful test of the SM-3 IIA against an ICBM-type target in 2020, but
the DOD had not articulated a concept of operations for employing the
SM-3 Block IIA and THAAD for homeland defense, including where in the
United States those systems could be deployed or how many would be
required, as requested by Congress. In addition, no funding for the
layered homeland defense program was included in the budget request for
FY 2023, and none is included in the budget request for FY 2024.
However, even though the MDA is investing in the GMD SLEP and the NGI
program to ensure defense of the homeland, forgoing a homeland underlay
will deprive the homeland of added capacity against worsening missile
threats. The utility of exploring the use of SM-3 and THAAD interceptors
to shoot down ICBMs can also extend beyond an underlay for the
continental United States, as they can work for other missions or defend
assets like Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. Currently, the only interceptor
the United States has available to intercept hypersonic missiles is the
SM-6.66 To strengthen U.S. capability against maneuverable hypersonic
missiles, the MDA is in the early stages of developing the Glide Phase
Interceptor (GPI), which is designed to intercept regional hypersonic
missiles in their glide phase of flight, and plans to conduct a
simulated engagement against a hypersonic glide vehicle in FY 2024.67
The FY 2024 budget request includes \$209 million for hypersonic
defense.68 The Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2
(IFPC 2) program has been moving very slowly, and a key assessment of
the system has recently been delayed by a year.69 The IFPC 2 would
defend against short-range rockets, artillery, and mortars as well as
cruise missiles, against which the United States, as noted, lacks a
sufficient defensive capability.70 As a system, IFPC would fill the gap
between short-range tactical air defense and ballistic missile defense
like PAC-3 and THAAD. In response to a congressional requirement that it
field an interim cruise missile defense capability in response to the
increasing cruise missile threat, the Army purchased two Iron Dome
batteries manufactured by the Israeli company Rafael.71 Despite prior
concerns about integrating Iron Dome as part of an enduring IFPC
solution, the Army is preparing the Iron Dome systems for operational
deployment and integration into its future missile defense command and
control system.72 In 2021, the Army deployed Iron Dome to Guam and
conducted a successful simulation to test the system,73 but there is as
yet no evidence to indicate that Iron Dome will be integrated into the
Guam defense system that is under development. In September 2021, the
Army awarded a contract to Dynetics to develop its own enduring IFPC 2
system.74 The Army set the initial date of March 2024 to receive 16
launcher prototypes and 60 "fieldable" interceptors.75 [Overall, the
United States has multiple capable interceptors, but there is much room
for improvement, including strengthening missile defense capabilities
against more robust missile threats from Russia and China, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. The most important step for the near
future will be on-time or early delivery of the NGI to ensure protection
of the homeland from North Korea. The United States also ought to invest
in research and development of space-based missile defense if it is ever
to have a truly comprehensive protection from larger-scale missile
attacks.]{.underline}

Sensors [The sensor component of the U.S. missile defense system is
distributed across the land, sea, and space domains and provides the
United States and its allies with an early warning of a launch of enemy
ballistic missiles in addition to missile tracking and discrimination.76
These sensors can detect a ballistic missile launch, track a missile in
flight, and even classify the type of projectile, its speed, and the
target against which the missile has been directed. They relay this
information to the command and control stations that operate interceptor
systems like Aegis (primarily a sea-based system) or THAAD (a land-based
system).]{.underline} Land-Based. On land, the major sensor
installations are the Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWRs), which are
concentrated along the North Atlantic and Pacific corridors that present
the most direct flight path for a missile aimed at the United States.
They include the phased array UEWRs based in Alaska, California,
Massachusetts, the United Kingdom, and Greenland that scan objects up to
3,000 miles away.77 They support homeland missile defense by providing
early warning and improving the quality of midcourse tracking data.78
The United States also deploys mobile AN/TPY-2 land-based sensors. Of
the 12 AN/TPY-2 systems that have been produced so far, five "are
operating in forward-based mode worldwide in support of the U.S. and its
allies" and seven "are operating in terminal mode as part of THAAD
weapon systems in support of Army and regional defense Missions."79
[According to Admiral Hill, "Radar 13, planned for delivery in March
2025, will be part of THAAD Battery 8 and be a fully modernized
configuration that includes significant obsolescence redesigns leveraged
from our ongoing Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases."80]{.underline} In
cooperation with the Republic of Korea, the United States deploys a
THAAD missile system accompanied by an AN/TPY-2 on the Korean Peninsula.
To fill a gap in missile discrimination capability for tracking North
Korean missiles over the Pacific, the MDA is developing the Long Range
Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in northern Alaska to improve coverage in
the northern Pacific. The LRDR utilizes the SPY-7 radar, which the MDA
will also purchase for the Guam defense system.81 The DOD has also
identified the need to develop the Homeland Defense Radar--Hawaii
(HDR--H) to fill a tracking and discrimination gap over Hawaii. The FY
2024 budget request includes \$103.5 million for the radar, which will
support the completion of acceptance testing and enable an operational
flight test in FY 2023.82 [Sea-Based. There are two types of sea-based
sensors. The first is the Sea-Based X-band (SBX) radar, which is
"mounted on a mobile, ocean-going, semi-submersible platform that
provides the missile defense system with an extremely powerful and
capable radar that can be positioned to cover any region of the
globe."83]{.underline} SBX is employed primarily in the Pacific. The
second is the SPY-1 radar system, which is mounted on U.S. Navy vessels
equipped with the Aegis Combat System and is therefore able to provide
data that can be utilized for ballistic missile missions. The Navy is
installing the radar on 29 new ships and replacing all SPY-1 radars with
the SPY-6 radar, which will have a greater detection range and other
advanced capabilities.84 [Space-Based. Finally, U.S. missile defense
sensors operate in space. From the ultimate high ground, space-based
sensors have the potential to detect and track missile launches from
almost any location from boost phase to terminal phase, unlike
ground-based radars that are limited in their tracking
range.85]{.underline} The MDA, the U.S. Space Force, and the Space
Development Agency (SDA) all control aspects of the space missile
defense sensor system. The oldest system that contributes to the missile
defense mission is the Defense Support Program (DSP), a constellation of
satellites that use infrared sensors to identify heat from booster and
missile plumes to detect an initial launch. In 2020, the Department of
Defense awarded a \$222.5 million contract to keep the program going
through 2030.86 The DSP satellite system has gradually been replaced by
the Space-Based Infrared Radar System (SBIRS) to improve the delivery of
missile defense and battlefield intelligence.87 Because SBIRS can scan a
wide swath of territory while simultaneously tracking a specific target,
for example, it is useful in observing tactical, or short-range,
ballistic missiles.88 The Space Force launched the sixth and final SBIRS
satellite in August 2022.89 The Air Force originally planned to launch
eight SBIRS satellites, but because of congressional funding delays, it
decided to end production of SBIRS early and move on to development of
its replacement, the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared
(Next-Gen OPIR) satellite, in 2017.90 The sixth SBIRS satellite was
formally transferred from Space Systems Command to Space Operations
Command on March 24, 2023.91 The first of the Next-Gen OPIR satellites,
which are designed to be more survivable against cyber and electronic
attacks, is scheduled to launch in 2025.92 The MDA also has developed
and deployed Spacebased Kill Assessment (SKA) sensors on commercial
satellites.93 SKA uses a network of infrared sensors to provide a hit
and kill assessment of homeland defense intercepts. After several years
of successful testing of SKA sensors in orbit, the FY 2024 budget
supports "on-orbit operations by experimenting and participating in
missile defense system ground and flight tests and providing situational
awareness hit assessment to USNORTHCOM during declared periods of
heightened activity."94 [The United States is developing a system of
satellites capable of providing global detection, tracking, and
discrimination of any missile launch.]{.underline} Dating from as far
back as President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, successive
Administrations have called for a proliferated layer of sensing
satellites in space to track the flight of any type of missile---not
just ballistic---from birth to death. A layer of space-based sensors can
be particularly useful in tracking hypersonic vehicles, which fly at
lower altitudes than ballistic missiles and can maneuver during flight.
The DSP and SBIRS systems were designed for ballistic missiles and can
lose track of missiles flying at lower altitudes. Since many new threats
are not flying on ballistic trajectories (hypervelocity vehicles, for
example), Congress has been paying close attention to development of a
space sensor layer that is capable of tracking the evolving threat.
Beginning in 2009, the MDA operated two Space Tracking and Surveillance
System-Demonstrators (STSS-D) satellites in an effort to demonstrate
this capability to track ballistic missiles that exit and reenter the
Earth's atmosphere during the midcourse phase. Data obtained by those
demonstration satellites were used to provide risk reduction to support
future space trackers. According to the MDA, "Space Vehicle\[s\] Vehicle
1 and 2 were retired on orbit on February 9, 2022 and March 8, 2022
respectively."95 [Today, the SDA, in conjunction with the MDA, is
developing a space Tracking Layer of satellites proliferated in
Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) as part of the SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space
Architecture, formerly known as the National Defense Space Architecture.
According to the SDA]{.underline}: Once fully operational, the SDA
Tracking Layer will consist of a proliferated heterogeneous
constellation of Wide Field of View (WFOV) space vehicles (SVs) that
provide persistent global coverage and custody capability combined with
the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space
Sensor (HBTSS) Medium Field of View (MFOV) SVs that provide precision
global access capability.96 Once deployed, the Tracking Layer will be
able to detect, track, and discriminate among different types of missile
launches throughout the entirety of the missiles' flights, including
both hypersonic glide vehicles and dimmer ballistic missile targets. The
SDA is also exploring the ability of space sensors to provide fire
control information directly to weapon platforms like THAAD or Aegis (as
opposed to the data going through a ground station). The first 10
satellites were launched in April 2023.97 The MDA has requested \$109.5
million for Missile Defense Space Programs in FY 2024 with a large
portion of the funding dedicated to the HBTSS.98 In 2021, the MDA
awarded contracts to Northrop Grumman and L3Harris to develop HBTSS
prototypes, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter of FY
2023.99 [Senior defense leaders have stated repeatedly that deploying
sensor satellites to space to track missiles from the high ground
throughout their entire flight is the best way to advance sensor
capability]{.underline}. For example, MDA Director Vice Admiral Jon Hill
has stated that "\[s\]pace-based sensors are critical to integrated
sensor-to-shooter capabilities used to defeat ballistic and hypersonic
missile threats."100 According to Admiral Charles Richard,
then-Commander of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM): [Future space-based
sensors may be able to provide birth-to-death detection, tracking, and
discrimination of hypersonic glide vehicle, cruise missile, and
ballistic missile threats globally.]{.underline} These abilities cannot
be fully achieved with the current or future terrestrial-based radar
architecture due to the constraints of geography and characteristics of
future missile threats.101 The space-based sensor program has been
plagued by insufficient funding requests and bureaucratic infighting
over whether the SDA or the MDA would develop the HBTSS,102 and despite
some progress in resolving the conflict, congressional concern has
reemerged.103 [A strong assessment of missile defense sensing
capabilities depends on progress made on the space-based sensor effort,
especially in view of warfighting commanders' urgent need for improved
missile tracking as well as the technological challenges associated with
developing a sensor that can perform in LEO]{.underline}.104 Development
of land-based sensors to fill the missile discrimination capability gap
over the Pacific has progressed slowly. Development of the LRDR
completed initial fielding, but the program incurred delays that were
"caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors."105 Additionally,
improved sensor capabilities are critical to addressing the cruise
missile threat to the homeland. As noted previously, the United States
has no dedicated missile defense system to counter this threat. Because
of their low altitude in flight and uncertain trajectories, cruise
missiles are more difficult to detect and track than ballistic missiles
are. Russia's ability to strike key strategic nodes in the U.S. homeland
from its own territory is of particular concern. To address this threat,
General VanHerck has emphasized improving domain awareness, because
early identification of a threat allows for options like left-of-launch
operations (destroying a missile before it is launched or preventing its
launch by neutralizing launch enablers) or alerting forces to take
precautionary actions.106 The Department of Defense is requesting
\$428.7 million in the FY 2024 defense budget "for the continued
fielding of four new over-the-horizon radars."107 [These radars will
provide long-range sensor coverage of likely air and cruise missile
threats to North America, as well as a capability against hypersonic
threats, and maritime surface vessels]{.underline}. NORTHCOM's unfunded
priorities list for FY 2024 includes \$212 million for nine long-range
radars "to fill surveillance gaps caused by existing radar failures."108
(This refers to Chinese balloon intrusions early in 2023 that initially
went undetected.109 ) [Additionally, developing a capability to detect,
track, and eventually intercept a conventional cruise missile attack
will be critical to denying adversaries the ability to hold the homeland
at risk below the nuclear threshold.]{.underline} The Space Force
removed one of three planned geosynchronous orbit satellites, a part of
the Next-Gen OPIR program, from its FY 2024 budget request.110 [The Army
is also progressing on development of the Lower-Tier Air and Missile
Defense System (LTAMDS) radars that will provide 360-degree threat
coverage for PAC-3 and other regional missile defense batteries; the
current Patriot radar can scan only one-third of the sky at a
time]{.underline}.111 The LTAMDS program has experienced "cascading
delays," and the current plan is to move it to the major capability
acquisition phase in FY 2024.112

[Command and control of the U.S. ballistic missile defense system
requires bringing together data from sensors and radars and relaying
those data to interceptors so that they can destroy incoming missiles
directed against the U.S. and its allies. The operational hub of missile
defense command and control is the Joint Functional Component Command
for Integrated Missile Defense (JFCC IMD), a component of STRATCOM
housed at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado]{.underline}. JFCC IMD
brings together Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Space, and Air Force personnel
and is co-located with the MDA's Missile Defense Integration and
Operation Center (MDIOC). [This concentration of leadership from across
the various agencies helps to streamline decision-making for those who
command and operate the U.S. missile defense system.113]{.underline}
Command and control of the GMD system to defend the homeland utilizes
the Ground-based Midcourse Defense Fire Control (GFC) system, which
consists of "a suite of hardware, software, and specially trained
personnel integrating GMD and supporting elements to manage all phases
of engagement."114 According to the MDA, "GMD employs integrated
communications networks, fire control systems, globally deployed sensors
and Ground-Based Interceptors that are capable of detecting, tracking
and destroying ballistic missile threats," and as of June 2023, 44 GBIs
were "currently emplaced" at Fort Greeley in Alaska and Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California.115 [Once a missile is launched, data from the
U.S. global network of sensors and radars travel through secure
satellite communications and ground-based redundant communications lines
to the Command Launch Equipment (CLE) software that can task GBIs to
fire at the incoming missile]{.underline}. Then, once the NORTHCOM
Commander---who becomes the supported commander during GMD
execution---in consultation with the President has determined the most
effective response to a missile threat, the CLE fire response option is
relayed to the appropriate GBIs in the field.116 [When the selected
missiles have been fired, they maintain contact with In-Flight
Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminals (IDTs) to
receive updated flight information that helps to guide them to their
target.]{.underline}117 To prepare for and execute GMD operations, the
NORTHCOM Commander can also utilize situational awareness data from the
Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC)
system. Through its software and network systems, C2BMC helps to process
and integrate sensor information to provide a more complete picture of
the battlespace.118 The GMD Fire Control system acts as the primary
decision aid for GMD execution, and the C2BMC system provides integrated
battlefield awareness information before and during GMD operations.119
[It also provides information to other missile defense systems like
THAAD and Patriot. Dozens of C2BMC workstations are distributed
throughout the world at U.S. military bases.]{.underline} C2BMC has
undergone multiple technical upgrades (called spirals) since 2004 to
bring more missile defense elements into the network. In 2019, the MDA
completed an upgrade that will help to expand Aegis missile defense
coverage by enabling Aegis Weapons Systems to engage by remote sensing.
[Regional missile defense systems like THAAD, PAC-3, and Aegis are
equipped with their own individual fire control systems to control the
launch of their interceptors.]{.underline} The C2BMC system can also
provide tracking information to individual missile defense batteries
from other regional sensors. Aegis BMD systems have onboard control
governed by the Aegis Combat System and can provide their sensor data to
the GMD system through C2BMC.120 C2BMC connects sensors and shooters
around the world to a global network, but there is no comparable system
to link sensors and shooters in a single region. The Army is developing
the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System
(IBCS) to provide this capability. Once fielded, IBCS would connect all
sensors and shooters in a region to a single fire control network.121
Like IFPC, IBCS would also link defenses against smaller threats with
ballistic missile defense. [A strong global command and control system
is critical to missile defense because linking information from sensors
can increase domain awareness and the time available to engage a target,
thereby improving the probability of intercept. According to General
VanHerck, "domain awareness" remains one of the challenges that makes
homeland defense "a potential limiting factor to ensuring rapid and
effective implementation and execution of global contingency plans."122
Domain awareness is especially important in dealing with cruise missile
threats to the homeland---threats against which the U.S. has no
comprehensive interceptor capability. Continuing to upgrade the C2BMC
system will remain critical to increasing the integration of missile
defense elements across the world and therefore improving chances of
intercept.]{.underline} For instance, it was revealed in 2021 that the
MDA provided U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with a hypersonic missile defense
capability, largely as a result of C2BMC improvements that allow sensors
to see the threat sooner.123 The MDA is expecting the LRDR's operational
acceptance in the fourth quarter of FY 2024 after a delay.124 It also
has linked C2BMC to the Army's IBCS, and it was expected that the round
of upgrades announced in August 2021 would further integrate those
systems and enhance the threat data provided to the GMD system.125 The
United States will need a more advanced command and control capability
as global missile threats shift to include cruise and hypersonic
missiles in addition to ballistic missiles. [The DOD is currently
developing a Joint All Domain C2 (JADC2) concept to integrate
non-compatible sensors across all domains into a single network so that
it can respond to a complex threat more efficiently]{.underline}.126
Missile defense command and control will strengthen as the services
begin to field JADC2 capabilities. In addition, NORTHCOM and the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) have conducted a series of
Global Information Dominance Experiments (GIDE) that GIDE V Mission
Commander Colonel Matthew Strohmeyer describes as "an opportunity to
stress-test our current systems and processes, introduce new
technologies and approaches, and learn in an experimentation environment
that replicates real-world operations."127 Sensor information can tend
to exist in stovepipes, and if it is not integrated, the result can be
failure to detect a threat.128 GIDE also uses artificial intelligence
and machine learning cues to ensure that the commander receives a full
data picture.129 IBCS will provide an important improvement in regional
missile defenses. The system will link all missile defense sensors and
interceptors to one fire control center as opposed to today's more
stovepiped approach in which each unit operates its co-located sensor
and launcher independently. By permitting air and missile defenses to
function as a joint kill web rather than as a linear kill chain, IBCS
will be able to determine the best shooter to take down an incoming
missile, in turn increasing the defended battlespace. The IBCS program
has been approved for Full Rate Production in April 2023.130
Advancements underway in missile defense command and control will become
increasingly necessary to enable defense against the growing missile
threat.

#### It\'s also key for strategic deterrence and grants authorities time to choose the best course of action

[Missile defense plays a critical role both in deterring an attack and
in mitigating the damage to U.S. forces, infrastructure, and population
centers in the event deterrence fails. The ability to deter an attack
depends on the ability to convince an adversary that the attack will
fail, that the cost of carrying out a successful attack is prohibitively
high, or that the consequences will outweigh the perceived
benefit.]{.underline} [A U.S. missile defense system strengthens
deterrence by offering a degree of protection to U.S. populations,
military forces, and allies that makes it harder for an adversary to
threaten them with missiles.16]{.underline} [By raising the threshold
for missile attack, missile defense can complicate an adversary's
planning, remove the option for a "cheap shot" against the United States
and its allies, and perhaps make an adversary think twice before
launching an attack, especially a larger-scale attack that would
certainly prompt a robust U.S. response]{.underline}. By protecting key
U.S. assets, missile defense also mitigates an adversary's ability to
intimidate or coerce the United States into making concessions. [Missile
defense systems help to enable U.S. and allied conventional
operations]{.underline}. During a regional conflict, adversaries could
deny the United States the ability to conduct offensive operations by
targeting U.S. and allied forward-deployed personnel or military assets.
In addition, they might try to decouple the United States from defense
of its allies by threatening to strike U.S. forces or the U.S. homeland
if the United States intervenes on behalf of others in a regional
conflict. Missile defenses can therefore strengthen the credibility of
U.S. extended deterrence by making it easier for the U.S. military to
introduce reinforcements that can move more freely through a region. [A
missile defense system gives decision-makers more time to choose the
best course of action. Without the ability to defend against an
impending attack, U.S. authorities would be limited to an unappealing
set of responses that could range from preemptive attacks to acceding to
an enemy's demands or actions. By providing some level of protection,
robust missile defense systems could affect the dynamics of
decision-making by removing the need to take immediate action---an
especially critical consideration in the event of an unauthorized or
accidental missile launch by an adversary. Missile defense can therefore
be profoundly stabilizing.]{.underline} Finally, in both nuclear and
conventional missile attack scenarios, missile defense minimizes damage
if deterrence fails. [A strong missile defense system would not only
help to protect countless American lives; it would also help to keep
U.S. forces available during a fight.]{.underline} During a campaign
against China in the Indo-Pacific, for example, missile defenses
deployed in the region could lower the loss rate for U.S. forces
compared to the rate of replacement, thereby extending the war effort
and giving U.S. forces more time to prevail.17 Since the end of the Cold
War, Congress has supported the development of a regional missile
defense system, but it has not supported the development of a
comprehensive layered system to protect the homeland. The reason: a
lingering Cold War--era view that U.S. missile defenses would be
"destabilizing" vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Skeptics argued that the
Soviets would be incentivized to strike first before defenses could be
deployed or more likely to strike first in a crisis for fear that a U.S.
missile defense system would undermine their retaliatory capability
after a U.S. first strike. The notion of long-range missile defenses as
destabilizing was codified in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty, from which the United States withdrew in 2002 citing the need to
develop such defenses against North Korea's and Iran's evolving missile
capabilities.

### Aff AT: Icebreakers Alt Cause 

#### Ice breakers are coming now.

[The [ICE Pact]{.mark} sends an immediate [signal to industry]{.mark}
partners [that Canada, the United States and Finland are committed
to]{.mark} purchasing more [icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Shipbuilders are responding by investing in supply chains]{.mark} and
shipyards in anticipation of these orders, positioning themselves to
earn]{.underline} procurement contracts when public funding for new
projects is made available. The arrangement [[reflects]{.mark} NATO's
awareness of the [Arctic's growing importance]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly as Russia and China seek to assert their presence in the
region with icebreaker fleets of their own. In the medium-to-long term,
collaborative workforce development and information sharing will shorten
the timeline for icebreaker design and construction, giving the ICE Pact
partners an opportunity to close the gap between the size of their
fleets and that of Russia, in particular. The diminishment of Arctic sea
ice over the next two decades will reduce shipping times between Europe
and Asia by as much as 40% and unlock trillions of US dollars of oil,
gas and critical minerals deposits. These economic incentives have
amplified strategic competition between Arctic and self-described
'near-Arctic' states, pushing countries to bolster their presence in the
region. Increased access to natural resources and new shipping routes
will exacerbate existing territorial disputes between the Arctic states,
even between close allies. For example, the disagreement between Ottawa
and Washington over whether the Northwest Passage falls within Canada's
internal territorial waters or can be classified as an international
strait will take on more urgency as melting ice allows for a larger
volume of ships to traverse the route.

## BMD crisis instability 

### Crisis instability 

#### BMDs get misinterpreted as escalatory -- that causes arms races.

defense [(BMD) system]{.underline} and the United States now deploying a
THAAD missile defense system in [South
Korea](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-usa-thaad-idUSKCN0ZO084),
their [[deployments]{.mark} may **[create]{.mark} more
[insecurity]{.mark}** rather than security]{.underline}. Today's
[[programs for defending]{.mark} against ballistic missile
attacks]{.underline} are not as ambitious as Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative. However, they still [run the [risk]{.mark} of **[creating an
arms race]{.mark}** with countries th, at perceive this system as
threatening]{.underline}, even if they are not explicitly targeted by
it. To ameliorate this dilemma, states that are not a target of this
system should cooperate with those that deploy them on issues that have
caused their installment in the first place. Unlike the missile defense
concepts of the past which were geared towards defeating a large-scale
nuclear attack, today's systems are designed to counter nations with
relatively few ballistic missiles and short range missiles. With at
least [thirty-one](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/missiles)
countries possessing ballistic missiles, states are naturally inclined
to obtain a defensive system that can counter the offensive capabilities
of others. [When [states acquire]{.mark} a [BMD]{.mark}
system]{.underline}, they [do so only [to protect themselves]{.mark}
against threats]{.underline}. **[[Unfortunately]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[surrounding **[states may perceive this as]{.mark} an
[escalatory]{.mark} move** since they will undermine their weapons
systems]{.underline}. States like [**[China]{.mark}** and
**[Russia]{.mark},** who [view]{.mark} such [deployments]{.mark} in
their regions [as **directed towards them**]{.mark}]{.underline}, oppose
their presence because it prevents them from threatening damage to
cities and military bases. The problem with increasing one's own
security, is that [[it can]{.underline}]{.mark} create feelings of
insecurity and [[force the]{.mark} insecure [state to increase]{.mark}
its own [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. This security dilemma exists
because there is a lack of communication between the parties involved
and a lack of identification of what has caused the insecurity in the
first place. Even though Poland and South Korea's BMD systems are
directed towards rogue states like Iran and North Korea respectively,
[these [systems could easily be redirected]{.mark}]{.underline} towards
other states. **[[Weapons are]{.mark} inherently
[ambiguous]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} They cannot always be easily
identified as offensive or defensive, and they cannot delineate the
targeting of one foe over another. To avoid this conflict spiral,
nations should make conciliatory efforts to show the other side that the
purpose of the weapons system is not aimed? towards them but another.
Both
[NATO](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/world/europe/russia-nato-us-romania-missile-defense.html)
and [South
Korea](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-usa-thaad-idUSKCN0ZO084)
have made it clear to Russia and China that their BMD systems are
directed towards other states, but this has failed to satisfy concerns.
Escaping this security dilemma can be accomplished through greater
cooperation with major powers on issues that affect the security of NATO
and South Korea. [By removing the threats in these regions, the BMD
systems will no longer be needed]{.underline}. Russia and China will
have to cooperate with the international community on increasing the
severity of sanctions against Iran and North Korea, or offer economic
assistance in exchange for their ballistic missile programs.

[[An]{.mark}other [example of]{.mark} this
[instability]{.mark}-[inducing]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the advent of antiballistic missile (ABM)
systems or [[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense efforts
[by the US in 1967]{.mark}]{.underline}. Touted to deny an adversary's
advantage to impose cost by claiming the capability to intercept inbound
nuclear warheads, [US [BMD]{.mark} programs **naturally [alarmed the
USSR]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Looking at Wohlstetter's stability
attributes[, a BMD capability violates an adversary's "penetrate enemy
active defense" characteristic]{.underline} and diminishes the
possibility of ensuring a costly retaliation. Against a US BMD, [the
[USSR perceived its missiles to be less]{.mark} likely to provide a
[credible]{.mark} retaliatory punch, [**fundamentally undermining**
the]{.mark} assured [vulnerability concept]{.mark}]{.underline}
essential to stable nuclear deterrence. This capability-limiting
perception spurred the USSR to develop its own BMD program and pushed
both superpowers into a counter-BMD arms race[. [This arms race
manifested in]{.mark} the development of multiple independently
targetable reentry vehicles ([MIRV) capable of **defeating BMD**]{.mark}
**systems**]{.underline}. 14 **[[The BMD race spurred the MIRV
race]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which fundamentally was an attempt to

stability between the US and USSR.15 Distressed by this BMD arms race
and its promise to intercept nuclear warheads, the Nixon administration
and [Soviet leadership signed the ABM treaty, halting any real
deployment of a BMD umbrella]{.underline} over the US and USSR.16
Understanding nuclear deterrence, the elements of nuclear deterrence
stability, and the symptoms of instability underpins the key elements
for analyzing new capabilities into the nuclear deterrence arena. [The

as defined by Wohlstetter's six criteria to credibly guarantee a costly
retaliatory response, [[underwrites]{.mark} the [modern US]{.mark}
nuclear deterrence [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The symptoms of
volatility--- including nuclear arms races, bellicose rhetoric, and
general international unease---are highlighted as nuclear deterrence
instability indicators. Altogether, they serve as the foundation to
measure modern BMD and the effects of nuclear-armed hypersonic missiles
on global and regional nuclear deterrence.

#### Countries view BMD as a challenge to their nuclear deterrent.

Unilateral strategic-range ballistic missile defence (**[[BMD) erodes
strategic stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the extent that [i[t is
seen to challenge]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n adversary's strategic
[deterrent.]{.mark}]{.underline} Notably, Russia and China are not
amenable to the view that the intense and costly western pursuit of
ballistic missile defence (an American obsession buttressed by a rare
case of Washington bipartisanship) is aimed simply at the North Korean
nuclear threat, or at future Iranian or other "rogue" nuclear threats.
American-led, multi-layered [[missile defence]{.mark}
pursuits]{.underline}, the [Russians and the Chinese
suspect]{.underline}, [[are]{.mark} [ultimately intended to undermine
the **credibility and effectiveness** of]{.mark} their [nuclear

[BMD]{.mark}]{.underline} technologies, [[the more]{.mark} their
[adversaries are inclined to fear missile defence]{.mark} as
credible]{.underline} (if not yet, then possibly in the future),
[[inclining them to]{.mark} retain and potentially **[expand]{.mark}
their [offensive arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is an
obsession/suspicion dynamic that is decidedly not conducive to mutual
nuclear arms reductions. Avoiding this defence/offence arms race will
require either the revival of an ABM-type treaty of mutual forbearance,
or recovery of the decades-old notion of cooperative missile defence
(even Ronald Reagan fleetingly proposed sharing missile defence
technology with the Soviet Union ). [That would mean the serious
exploration of joint programs with the objective of protecting any
vulnerable populations]{.underline} from isolated, very low volume,
long- and medium-range missile attacks -- with accompanying guarantees
that such systems would have no consequential capacity against even
drastically reduced arsenals of the major powers.

#### India is a test case -- Indian BMD forces Pakistani retaliation through expansion.

**Khalid 17**, staff writer for Eurasia Review (Asma Khalid, 4/17/2017,

On February 11, 2017, [India conducted the successful test of high
altitude inceptor]{.underline} missile, Prithvi Defence Vehicle (PDV).
According to scholars, such developments and [I[ndia's pursuit of
BMD]{.underline}]{.mark} [now has the ability to shake the nuclear
calculus]{.underline} of region. Subsequently[, it [will challenge
the]{.mark} **very [basis of strategic stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and deterrence in the South Asian region. Developments in the Indian BMD
system depict that India is quickly heading towards higher war-fighting
capabilities from its minimum deterrence posture. Although, India claims
that it's enhancing its capabilities to counter China, according to
analysts [[such capabilities]{.mark} will [allow India to adopt an
offensive strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} over Pakistan. The [**[Indian
BMD system will increase instability]{.mark}** and Pakistan's security
dilemma]{.underline}. [[It will force]{.mark} the [Pakistan to improve
the]{.mark} quality and [quantity of its nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} and it will force Pakistan to expand its
military expenditure. Other interconnected issues are regarding the
effectiveness of BMD and a false sense of security because the BMD
system cannot guarantee the absolute interception and destruction of
targets. As such, [[the security dilemma]{.mark} and false sense of
security [will trigger the crisis instability.]{.mark}]{.underline}
However, in the South Asian strategic landscape where a tri-angular
relation exists the phenomena of nuclear deterrence will become more
complex and result in a major catastrophe. The Indian [pursuit of [a BMD
system]{.mark} has [complicated the security
calc]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark} of regional states]{.underline}. [[It
will]{.mark} have [spillover]{.mark}]{.underline} effect on its
neighboring states [thus [triggering]{.mark} and consolidating [a new
arms race]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. It is imperative for
Pakistan to take effective measures to counter the volatility instigated
by the Indian BMD. Acquiring or manufacturing their own BMD system is
least available option due to economic restraints, so viable options in
this regard is qualitative improvements to target the vulnerabilities of
the Indian BMD. In this regard, Pakistan's surface-to-surface ballistic
missile, Ababeel has significant contributions in the defence
arrangements of Pakistan. Ababeel is capable of delivering multiple
warheads using Multiple Independently target Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV)
technology. It is a constructive addition in the Pakistan's defence. It
will facilitate Pakistan to sustain the credibility of its deterrence
strategy against the Indian BMD system due to its ability to deliver
multiple warheads. [**[India]{.mark}** has **[increased]{.mark} the
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** of regional states, thus **[instigating
instability and arms race]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Policy options for
Pakistan to counter the instability against the Indian BMD system is to
quantitative and quantitative improvements in its nuclear and missile
capabilities in a way that won't have an effect on the credible
strategic symmetry and avoid an arms race in the region.

[[BMD systems]{.mark} aim to minimize the magnitude of the enemy's
retaliation thus [undermin]{.mark}ing [the state of mutual
vulnerability,]{.mark}]{.underline} which has been the cardinal
principle of deterrence since the onset of the nuclear age. Despite
their limited success rate, [deploying BMD systems]{.underline}
complemented by other counterforce capabilities [creates strong

[leading to]{.mark} the **highest degree of [crisis
instability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To ward off counterforce threats and
given that [the most feasible approach to counteract BMDs is
overwhelming them]{.underline} through enhanced numbers, [[the
adversary's warhead tally undergoes an upsurge]{.mark} thus
[sparking]{.mark} the risk of **[arms race

are relatively modest and it would be several years or even decades
before New Delhi could deploy its multilayered BMD. The Indian media

integrated, India's BMD would have a success rate of 99.8%. It is worth
underscoring that the USA's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) after investing
more than \$200 billion since 1985 in the BMD program claims 81.9%
successful hit-to-kill intercept attempts from 2001 -- 2018 across all
of its programs during optimal testing conditions. Keeping in view the
cutting-edge quintessence of the USA's technological base and backed by
huge investments in the BMD, Indian claims of a prospective 99.8%
success rate do not appear to be anything but self-deceiving pretense
aimed at bestowing the political leadership with delusionary complacency
of defense against the adversaries' ballistic missiles. Given that the
Indian leadership has essentially shrugged off the core tenets of the
theory of nuclear revolution by long aiming to find space to use force
under the nuclear overhang, the delusion of defense provided by [[BMD
could]{.mark} further [incentivize New Delhi to]{.mark} tilt more
towards resorting to nuclear brinkmanship and to [act]{.mark} more
[recklessly]{.mark}]{.underline} during a crisis. Supplement
[[this]{.mark} risk-prone [attitude]{.mark} of Indian
leadership]{.underline} with India's counterforce temptations towards
Pakistan backed by its relentless pursuit of other counterforce
technologies, such as MIRVs and improved ISR, the consequence **[[would
be the highest degree of]{.mark} crisis
[instability]{.mark}]{.underline}** in South Asia. India's 2003
declaratory nuclear doctrine relies on the threat of "massive"
retaliation "to inflict unacceptable damage", which falls within the
"deterrence-by-punishment" model. The BMD pursuit entails India's
nuclear force posture tilting more towards "deterrence-by-denial".
Keeping in view India's counterforce ambitions vis-à-vis Pakistan in
contravention of its declaratory policy of NFU, India's leaning toward
"deterrence-by-denial" with the pursuit of BMD further underscores
inconsistencies in India's declaratory nuclear doctrine and the emerging
force posture. This would further undercut the transparency in the
deterrence equation between Pakistan and India thus undermining
strategic stability in South Asia. Keeping in view the imminent
integration of MIRV technology in Indian missiles, India's nuclear
arsenal (which surpassed Pakistan's estimated arsenal as per the 2024
SIPRI report) is likely to undergo a manifold increase. [India's
[attempts to gain a strategic advantage]{.mark}]{.underline} through its
relentless drive to bolster the nuclear triad, imminent massive-scale
increase in its nuclear arsenal, and its unrelenting pursuit of BMD
[[imperil the]{.mark} **delicate strategic [equilibrium]{.mark}** in the
region]{.underline} thus risking arms race instability.

The [[plan]{.mark} also [has]{.mark} potentially [dangerous strategic

#### Russia is already concerned about future BMD.

[[The]{.mark} potential [inability of Russia to deter]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} in a future
scenario without escalating a crisis [[will force Moscow to re-evaluate
its]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent]{.mark} capabilities. It will seek to
develop new capabilities]{.underline} to better penetrate, circumvent,
or target the US BMD system so that it can restore its ability to deter
the United States with a credible threat. Before a crisis erupts, [this
crisis [instability will manifest]{.mark} itself [in]{.mark} [arms race
instability]{.mark} over the long term]{.underline}. In March 2018,
President [[Putin announced]{.mark} the development of numerous
**[asymmetric nuclear delivery systems]{.mark}** designed [to
circumvent]{.mark} missile [defens]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}.89
While it is not certain that Russia will ever deploy these weapons,
[their development signals Moscow's discomfort with the 46 potential
future strategic situation]{.underline}. Russia would not spend its
increasingly constrained resources to develop these asymmetric
capabilities if it truly felt that the future situation was secure.
Still, it is doubtful that Russia is developing these weapons to counter
current US defenses. Even conservatively, as shown in the analysis
above[, [the current US]{.mark} BMD [system is not a threat]{.mark} to
crisis stability]{.underline}. Additionally, it will be years before
Russia can deploy many of these systems, so [[they are]{.mark} likely
[intended to counter **a future**]{.mark} **US [BMD]{.mark}
system**]{.underline}. The development of these new systems should serve
as a clear warning that US BMD has in fact degraded arms race stability
and that Russian BMD concerns are legitimate. Unfortunately, US
lawmakers have not received this message and have demanded that the
Defense Department develop defenses to counter some of these asymmetric
threats.90 If the US continues to pursue similar counters to these new
asymmetric nuclear capabilities[, [it will]{.mark} again risk
**[destabiliz]{.mark}ing [the situation]{.mark}** and lead to further
balancing and nuclear arms development efforts by Moscow.]{.underline}
Consequences for Future Arms Limitations Treaties The final result that
becomes clear from this analysis is that [[a future]{.mark} arms control
[treaty exacerbates the]{.mark} strategic [instability caused by]{.mark}
a [future BMD]{.mark} system]{.underline} and that future treaty
reductions focused only on offensive weapons will no longer work. As
seen in the earlier results, even the current US BMD system combined
with a future treaty-reduced nuclear arms limit (Scenario C) shows only
marginal stability. [[Russia has]{.mark} likely [come to a similar
conclusion]{.mark} as this study, that BMD combined with future arms
reductions is a recipe for strategic instability]{.underline}. Russia
has continually argued since 1972 that limits on strategic defensive
arms are a critical foundation to offensive arms limitations. In fact,
[[the last two treaties]{.mark} (SORT and New START) [required]{.mark}
explicit statements [acknowledging that BMD was]{.mark} a
[critical]{.mark} factor in stability]{.underline} and that future
expansion could cause instability as a condition of agreement.
Therefore, it seems 47 unlikely, particularly given the strength of the
statement in 2010's New START Treaty, that Russia will agree to further
arms reductions without specific, verifiable limits on missile defense.

#### BMD is an offensive tool. It's also ineffective.

To create a ballistic missile defence system today would require a state
to increase its military capabilities by adding more missiles with
greater capabilities as well as delivery systems in order to mobilize
the missiles to intercept incoming threats. [[Increasing]{.mark} the
number of [weapons available]{.mark} for use in the world [is not a
sound strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} for promoting peace and security.
There has never been a weapon that man has not used on itself, so to
think that a BMD system would have a deterrent quality to it is naïve.
"Shields may be protective, but linked to swords they are part of an
offensive and provocative system. And [[the US]{.mark} [ballistic
missile shield]{.mark} that Canada is now considering making its own,
[is being]{.mark} aggressively [linked to a]{.mark}n every-sharpening
nuclear [sword]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Regehr 27). Non-proliferation is
the only real means to promoting international peace and security. This,
however, is paradoxical when ballistic missile defence is added to the
equation. It is ironic but, "for BMD to have any chance at success,
non-proliferation must be highly successful. [BMD is not something you
can turn to if non-proliferation fails;]{.underline} BMD depends on the
success of non-proliferation. Yet, at the same time, [[the]{.mark} very
[pursuit of BMD **undermines**]{.mark} **[non-prolif]{.mark}eration**
efforts]{.underline}, thus helping to create the conditions under which
BMD cannot be successful -- it is the classic lose-lose scenario"
(Regehr 22). **[[B]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efence
[not provide peace and security]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it breaks these
things down. Prominent academic and critic of US hegemony, Noam Chomsky,
points out that "[[BMD is]{.mark} widely recognized to be [a 'Trojan
horse]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the real issue: [the]{.mark} coming
[weaponizaton of space]{.mark}]{.underline},' with highly destructive
offensive weapons placed in or guided from space. **[[BMD]{.mark} itself
[is an offensive weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is understood by
close allies, and also by potential adversaries" (Chomsky 226). The
decline in peace and security precipitates further problems in the
international community in the form of instability in the balance of
power. "[Greater global and regional instability would basically
encourage arms races,]{.underline} including the use of technologies
that are still only hypothetical" (Ivanov 18[). [A further
reason]{.mark} that ballistic missile defence [is]{.mark} not
strategically wise is the fact [that these]{.mark} weapon **[systems are
ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For the amount of money and
infrastructure that would be necessary to implement such a system, their
value and effectiveness are more than questionable. For example, "when
the system that is now being assembled is fully operational and working
as intended, [[it will]{.mark} still [be aimed at]{.mark} only about [1
percent of the]{.mark} nuclear-tipped [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}
that are capable of reaching North American shores. Protection from the
other 99 percent of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting North
America will still depend entirely on prevention" (Regehr 12-13). With
statistics like this, [[it is surprising that BMD]{.mark} systems
[are]{.mark} even [being]{.mark} [considered]{.mark}]{.underline} in
international security. To be able to defend oneself against only 1% of
the total threat is not strategic, **[[it is only providing false
security.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This is further proof of the offensive
nature of ballistic missile defence. "Even when it matures, strategic
missile defense is not intended, nor will it ever have the capacity, to
protect Americans, or Canadians, from the primary arsenals of missiles
capable of striking North America" (Regehr 12).

[[Russia]{.mark} has [demanded]{.mark}]{.underline} "legally-binding"
[[limitations on]{.mark} U.S. [BMD]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}.
While the Unit- ed States has not wanted to provide such an agreement,
numerous [U.S. [officials]{.mark} have [tried explaining to]{.mark}
their [Russia]{.mark}n counterparts that the U.S. [BMD systems are
neither]{.mark} direct- ed [against Russia nor effective in
shooting]{.mark} down Russian ballistic
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}.85 Despite these clear U.S. political
statements and "limited" deployments, [[Russia and China remain con-
cerned about]{.mark} the impact of U.S. BMD on their **[strategic
deterrents]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Their main concerns are not current
U.S. BMD systems, but the development of "game changing" technologies in
the future and advanced systems in the future, as we discuss below. But
[even with the current type of hit-to-kill kinetic
interceptors]{.underline}, which the United States has deployed only 44
stra- tegic BMD interceptors over the last 13 years, [[Russia]{.mark}
and [China]{.mark} are [concerned]{.mark} that [there is **nothing to
stop the United States**]{.mark} from deploying far more than this
modest number]{.underline} in the coming years to decades. As we have
noted previously, [this possibility pressures China more than
Russia]{.underline} because of China's much smaller sized nuclear
arsenal. At least [[two fields of]{.mark} game changing [BMD
tech]{.mark}nology could [exacerbate]{.mark} strategic and crisis
[instability]{.mark}]{.underline} among the United States, Russia, and
China: 1. [The development of non-kinetic, high-energy
weapons]{.underline} would allow both rapid and low-cost, multi-shot
capabilities. This could enable higher kill capability against in-
coming warheads, as opposed to relying upon slower-moving interceptor
missiles with kinetic kill vehicles. Solid-state lasers are already
finding some important tactical applications and may be relevant to BMD,
as well. [Development of tactical high-en- ergy lasers is already well
along]{.underline}, and adaptive optics and related technologies could
be used to apply them to strategic BMD, for example. Boost-phase
intercepts might be possible using high-energy laser systems carried on
unmanned aerial vehicles.86 The set of concepts referred to as
"left-of-launch" techniques could prevent mis- siles from even being
launched by disrupting, disabling, or destroying them. Cyber options are
examples of these techniques, where a cyberattack could seriously com-
promise an adversary's ability to launch its ballistic missiles. This
type of action was reportedly already used against North Korean missile
launches.

#### Has huge warrants about a BMD not being effective and not being able to deter Russian aggression\-\--it also mentions the arms race turn, so it may function as a dual card. 

**Arms Control Center, 5-21**-2025, \"Fact sheet: U.S. Ballistic Missile
Defense\", Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation,
https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-u-s-ballistic-missile-defense/

Fact sheet: U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense UPDATED: May 21, 2025
Ballistic missile defense systems seek to defend a given area from
attack by locating and tracking an incoming ballistic missile and then
launching an interceptor to destroy the missile before it can reach its
target. All U.S. interceptors are made up of a booster rocket and a kill
vehicle. While most interceptors are "hit-to-kill," meaning the kill
vehicle crashes into the incoming missile to destroy them, others use a
blast fragmentation warhead that detonates an explosive charge and
sprays shrapnel in the hopes of detonating the payload in the incoming
missile. The United States employs missile defenses that launch both
types of interceptors. [[The U.S]{.mark}. Missile Defense Agency ([MDA)
has worked to develop]{.mark} and deploy a number of such systems to
defend the homeland, allies and assets abroad. In this vein, the United
States has developed three theater (regional) systems and one to protect
the homeland, [the]{.mark} Ground-Based Midcourse Defense [(GMD)
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Theater Ballistic Missile Defense systems
target incoming short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic
missiles. These systems include the land-based Patriot Advanced
Capability (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
systems deployed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and the sea-based
Aegis system, although the Aegis Ashore can be deployed on land. The GMD
system aims to protect the U.S. homeland from intermediate and
long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) by destroying the
incoming warhead in its midcourse phase, outside of the Earth's
atmosphere. It is designed to be effective against an accidental or
rogue missile launch and not against the strategic deterrents of Russia
and China. First deployed in 2004, this system currently comprises 40
ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely in Alaska and four at
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, in addition to associated
satellite and radar systems. The Next Generation Interceptor program,
currently being implemented, would produce 31 new interceptors to
replace current interceptors in Fort Greely and Vandenberg Air Force
Base for more advanced interceptor systems. These new interceptors are
expected to cost \$498 million each totaling \$18 billion over the life
of the program. They are currently planned to be fielded in 2027 or
2028. The Pentagon is also spending \$1.5 billion on a new missile and
air shield for Guam in FY 2024. The existing system was announced to
defend Guam against North Korean threats, but this new development is
set to defend against Chinese threats. Guam is currently protected by
the Army's THAAD ballistic missile defense system and the Navy's Aegis
system. The United States' deterrence strategy proclaims that offensive
nuclear weapons deter nuclear weapon states, like Russia and China, and
U.S. missile defenses are meant to protect against rogue state threats,
like North Korea and, maybe in the future, an Iranian ICBM. However,
[[under the Trump administration, the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [shifted]{.mark} its strategy [toward]{.mark} creating
[a layered missile defense system]{.mark} that plans to integrate the
systems deployed abroad with those deployed at home. [Although]{.mark}
still [not effective against large-scale attacks]{.mark}, the adjustment
was intended to increase protection in light of continued development of
missile capabilities, including cruise and hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}. In October 2022, the Biden administration released
its Missile Defense Review, which outlines integrated deterrence that
incorporates diplomacy, missile defense, and nuclear capabilities.
Nuclear weapons are stated to be the credible threat to deter attacks,
while missile defense is deterrence by denial. This missile defense
strategy prioritizes the modernization and expansion of the GMD system
and strengthening regional defense and deterrence in cooperation with
allies. How do these systems work? While engaging hypersonic and cruise
missiles requires defending areas, ballistic missile defense considers
engaging threats during three stages: the boost phase, the midcourse
phase and the terminal phase of flight. Boost-phase defense encompasses
engagements while the booster rocket is still accelerating. The
midcourse defense layer can be divided into 1) the ascent phase, when
the incoming missile is engaged prior to apogee; 2) the descent phase,
when intercept occurs after apogee. Finally, terminal defense refers to
engagements as and after warheads reenter the atmosphere and become
subject to drag and reentry heating. Engagements in the boost phase are
ideal but very difficult because there is such a short time period to
make a decision. Boost-phase engagements also require engagement by
systems that are deployed near enemy territory, which can undermine the
strategic deterrents of adversaries. Presently, the United States does
not have this technology and it was found not to be "practical or
feasible" by the National Academy of Sciences. Terminal defense is
dangerous because it is the last shot at interception. The PAC-3, THAAD
and Aegis systems all target the terminal phase. In November 2020, the
Aegis SM-3 Block IIA was tested against an ICBM-class target and deemed
successful, although it was not conducted under real-world conditions.
The U.S. GMD system, as its name dictates, seeks to engage incoming
missiles in the midcourse layer. It relies on an extensive network of
ground- and space-based sensors and radars, which are deployed from
Greenland to Japan, and from the Pacific Ocean to launch detection
satellites orbiting the Earth. Do these systems work? Despite the
assurances of MDA officials, presently, these defense systems have an
uneven testing record. [The Government Accountability Office found that
[the MDA failed to meet its]{.mark} planned [testing goals]{.mark} in
fiscal year (FY) 2019 due to significant development delays. [The lack
of testing is problematic]{.mark} as it results in less data to validate
system capabilities]{.underline}. These failures are particularly
concerning given the MDA's \$199 billion in funding from 2002 to 2023
and requested \$55 billion from FY 2024 through 2028. This is an
increase of \$8 billion from the requested \$47 billion from FY 2019
through 2023. [[In]{.mark} the [tests that have occurred, the]{.mark}
GMD [system has]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n approximate [50% success
rate]{.mark} in scripted tests and replacements for these weapons are
years away. In October of 2019, the Pentagon terminated its Redesigned
Kill Vehicle program, intended for deployment in 2023, to augment and
replace the GMD's outdated and unreliable interceptors, due to technical
design flaws]{.underline}. From the limited information publicly
available, [it is difficult to assess whether 50% can be considered
successful, as valuable data can be derived from any test regardless of
its success. What is clear, however, is that GMD is expensive and not,
apparently, meeting its goals.]{.underline} The MDA enacted \$2.8
billion in FY 2023 and requested an additional \$3.25 billion in FY 2024
for existing GMD and the development of the Next-Generation Interceptor.
In the interim, Congress has asked MDA to field a separate interceptor
by 2026. There is a long list of expensive agency flops, including \$2.2
billion for a failed sea-based radar, \$5.3 billion on a scrapped
chemical laser system, and \$2.7 billion on an ineffective blimp-based
radar system. While the theater missile systems have a better testing
record, they are not immune to reliability concerns. Up until 2006,
THAAD had an exceedingly poor testing record of 2 out of 16, but since
then, its testing record has improved to 16 out of 16. The Aegis
continues to have a mixed record of 34 successes out of 43 attempts. The
PAC-3's record is quite poor in the field, and the numbers from the
Pentagon are highly disputed. Threat to Strategic Stability and Arms
Control In theory, effective missile defense should increase homeland
security. [However, [the system is only effective against small-scale
threats and provides]{.mark} essentially [zero protection
against]{.mark} attack by a larger adversary such as [Russia]{.mark}.
Furthermore, [both Russia and China have cited U.S. missile
defenses]{.mark}, and the lack of transparency around them, [as
justifications for building]{.mark} their own [nuclear
capabilities]{.mark} --- an effort [to blame the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [for an arms race]{.mark} they are running. Russia has
also cited U.S. missile defense as a reason for its reluctance to engage
in further arms control.]{.underline} Specifically, Moscow and Beijing
are concerned about the Aegis SM3-Block IIA, which the United States
tested against an ICBM-class target in November 2020. The United States
plans to deploy the system in Poland and complete construction on Aegis
Ashore Poland in 2023, ostensibly to counter a future potential Iranian
threat, and in the Asia pacific. Later in 2023, technical capability
declaration is expected, meaning that all major components of the system
are installed and ready to begin integration. However, [[Russia and
China have responded with]{.mark} a wide array of [new missile
capabilities]{.mark} that are advertised as to defeat U.S. missile
defense systems]{.underline}.

Yet, [[as long as nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [exist]{.mark}, fully
[eliminating]{.mark} [the danger]{.mark} of nuclear war [is not]{.mark}
a [plausible]{.mark}]{.underline} choice. [[**Even if** Golden
Dome]{.mark} is fully [assembled]{.mark} [and achieves 90
percent]{.mark} interception rate, **[10 percent]{.mark} of incoming
warheads [would still get through]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the event
of a major-scale attack, [[at least 60]{.mark} [Chinese and 150 Russian
warheads would]{.mark} still [strike]{.mark} [targets]{.mark} in the
United States]{.underline}. The [resulting [fallout would inflict
catastrophic damage]{.mark} across the country]{.underline} and trigger
a U.S. nuclear response, regardless of the adversary\'s targeting plans.
Although there is no evidence a conflict between nuclear-weapon states
would just fizzle out, there are plenty of indicators to suggest
otherwise. These include the recently declassified 1983 \"Proud
Prophet\" wargame, which demonstrated how a limited nuclear war in
Europe likely would escalate rapidly and catastrophically. Air Force
Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, described their
nuclear wargaming exercises in 2017: \"They end the same way every time.
They end badly, with global nuclear war.\" Finally, Trump himself warned
that any nuclear weapon use would mean \"probably oblivion.\"18
[National [ballistic missile defense is]{.mark} technologically
[unfeasible]{.mark}, prohibitively [costly]{.mark}, [and bad for
deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although it may be efficient in
\"mopping-up\" missiles from an adversary\'s limited retaliatory nuclear
strike (in the unlikely case a hypothetical U.S. nuclear first strike
manages to take out most of the other capabilities), [[this scenario
also presumes]{.mark} that [adversaries]{.mark} [would passively observe
the]{.mark} massive [undertaking]{.mark} required [to establish an
effective]{.mark} national [BMD system]{.mark}]{.underline}. A defense
with 90 percent effectiveness would allow only 10 out of 100 warheads to
go through, but a strike consisting of 1,000 warheads would leak 100.
[While in a static case a missile defense system could enhance
deterrence by reducing the adversary\'s confidence that an attack will
be successful, if it is not perfect, [it]{.mark} also [creates
incentives for a nuclear]{.mark} [arms race.]{.mark}]{.underline} Unless
constrained by resources, [[adversaries will]{.mark} attempt to
[regain]{.mark} lost [confidence by increasing]{.mark} the size of their
[nuclear arsenals]{.mark} [or]{.mark} by
[modernizing]{.mark}]{.underline} to improve delivery vehicles. In
addition to building up its nuclear stockpile and adding hundreds of new
ICBM silos, China has tested systems specifically aimed at evading
missile defense, including by reviving the idea of placing nuclear
weapons in fractional orbit. Meanwhile, Russia is modernizing its ICBMs
and developing \"exotic\" nuclear systems to bypass missile defenses.19
Russia is also testing concepts for nuclear anti-satellite weapons, and
has recently warned that [any attempts to deploy U.S. space-based
interceptors would further fuel the militarization of
space]{.underline}.20 Although [U.S. missile defense efforts are not the
only reason, [they provide a pretext for Chinese and Russian military
expansion and refusal to]{.mark} discuss nuclear [disarmament and arms
control]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[U.S.]{.mark} ballistic missile [defense
also is not deterring No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea\'s [nuclear buildup,
with Pyongyang]{.mark} rapidly [closing its tech]{.mark}nological
[gap]{.mark} with U.S. peer competitors.]{.underline}

by its proponents. Instead of making the United States more secure [it
[would]{.mark} set in motion a chain of events that would [leave both
superpowers]{.mark} considerably [less secure]{.mark}.
[Deterrence]{.mark} would be [weakened and]{.mark} crisis [instability
increased]{.mark}, [making]{.mark} the [prospect]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a
[war more likely]{.mark}.]{.underline} Damage limitation would be
undermined by the need of both [sides]{.mark} to [increase]{.mark} their
strategic [arsenals in order to compensate]{.mark} [for]{.mark} each.

expected to [target more]{.mark} of their missiles [against
cities]{.mark}, [which would]{.mark} still [remain]{.mark} the [most
vulnerable]{.mark} of [targets]{.mark}.]{.underline} *BMD requires
abrogation of the ABM Treaty and would thus sound the death knell to the
arms control process.* [This would [trigger a]{.mark} new [round of the
arms race]{.mark} and extend military competition into space. Defensive
[systems would]{.mark} also [require vast expenditures for
research]{.mark}, [development, testing, deployment, and
maintenance,]{.mark} [with]{.mark} very [little to show]{.mark} for this
expenditure.]{.underline} *Finally,* [a [commitment to BMD]{.mark} would
[provoke]{.mark} [a serious crisis in the]{.mark} Atlantic
[alliance]{.mark}; [regardless of its ultimate outcome]{.mark}, such [a
crisis would leave NATO and the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
in a [weakened]{.mark} position [militarily]{.mark} and
[politically.]{.mark}]{.underline} *The late Republican senator Arthur
Vandenberg was fond of attacking schemes he opposed by declaring \"the
end unattainable, the means hairbrained, and the cost staggering.\" For
Vandenberg, this was a politically useful form of exaggeration. For BMD,
it is an entirely fitting description.*

#### China and Russia will always perceive any increase in capability as a threat.

**Dwyer 23,** Masters Student (James Dwyer, 5/27/2023, "The best offence
is a good defence? : The effects of ballistic missile defence on nuclear
deterrence", *University of Tasmania*,

This chapter, and this thesis as a whole, has presented the argument
that what is being seen in [both cases is [a clear indicator of]{.mark}
the beginning of [a security dilemma fuelled arms race]{.mark}. This
[has been triggered by]{.mark} the US' [implementation of BMD in]{.mark}
both [Europe]{.mark} [and the Asia Pacific]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}
according to offensive realism, [is motivated due to]{.mark} the
[increase in relative power and the]{.mark} possible [achievement of
nuclear superiority]{.mark}.]{.underline} Through the application of
offence-defence theory to the cases presented, we can conclude that
there is considerable ambiguity as to whether BMD and nuclear weapons
are offensive or defensive, [but that [the use of nuclear weapons
offensively]{.mark} still [possesses the advantage]{.mark} [over
BMD]{.mark} as a purely defensive measure.]{.underline} Thus, as a
result of this ambiguity, the security dilemma will be at its most
intense as determined by offence-defence theory. Furthermore, this is
fundamentally changing the way that nuclear deterrence functions, and
has functioned since its inception through the introduction of defensive
capabilities, as opposed to the previous notion of defence through the
threat of overwhelming offence. Thus, [the introduction of [US BMD
is]{.mark} not only triggering an intense arms race though the
stimulation of a security dilemma, but that this is [fundamentally
changing traditional notions of]{.mark} the way [nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} ultimately [functions]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Furthermore, the current [capabilities of US BMD are irrelevant, as the
perceived or potential capability are sufficient for]{.mark} both
[Russia]{.mark} and [China]{.mark} [to view BMD as a threat]{.mark},
[and take]{.mark} specific [steps to address]{.mark} the threat, [given
that]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence remains the]{.mark} ultimate [guarantor
of Russia]{.mark} [and China's]{.mark} [security]{.mark},]{.underline}
even though both place different levels of emphasis on their respective
deterrents. This thesis has also demonstrated the relevance of offensive
realism as an explanatory tool for the behaviour of great powers and
their interactions, particularly in terms of nuclear deterrence.
Furthermore, the thesis has demonstrated the compatibility of
offence-defence theory and offensive realism. While stemming from
defensive realism, offence-defence theory is perfectly compatible with
offence-defence theory, but the underlying assumption that
offence-defence balances inherently favour the defence, leading to great
powers being defence positionalists as defensive realists argue is
flawed., at least in the context of nuclear weapons. [As these case
studies demonstrate, great powers in some circumstances enhance
offensive capabilities (nuclear weapons) via use of technologically
sophisticated defences (BMD) if they can deploy them more easily and/or
faster than rival powers. As a result, rival states will instead enhance
their offensive capabilities to re-establish offence dominance, in order
to reduce the impact of defensive capabilities on their relative
power.]{.underline}

CHINA", *Air War College*, https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA620282.pdf)

The United States Ballistic Missile Defense ([[BMD]{.mark}) [Policy
states]{.mark} that [our]{.mark} BMD [system is intended to
defend]{.mark} the country against a limited ballistic missile attack by
"states acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline} and other weapons of mass
destruction in contravention of international norms [and in defiance of
the international community"- in other words, [against rogue states and
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It explicitly states]{.mark} that [our
capabilities are not focused on China or Russia]{.mark}]{.underline},
are not intended to affect the strategic balance with them, [[and are
not]{.mark} of [sufficient]{.mark} capacity [to deal with]{.mark}
Chinese or Russian [large scale attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite
the pronounced intention of U.S. policy, the [overmatched capability of
the US BMD System against even the most inflated assessment of North
Korea ballistic missile capability [upsets the]{.mark} strategic
[balance and increases tensions with China]{.mark}]{.underline}, hence
complicating Asian-Pacific regional stability and U.S./allied security
interests there.

#### Better BMD leads to hypersonics

Stabilizing regional nuclear deterrence is a more difficult problem.
Many of the [regional nuclear [powers possess a form of BMD that
has]{.mark} at least [some]{.mark} [capability]{.mark} against each
other's nuclear delivery systems]{.underline}. As stated earlier, [the
natural [evolution of these]{.mark} regional nuclear [standoffs is
to]{.mark} [develop nuclear weapon]{.mark} systems [that]{.mark} can
[defeat missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conse- quently, opposing
regional nuclear [[powers will]{.mark} want to [develop]{.mark}
[hypersonic weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The dangerous]{.mark}
transition [periods will emerge]{.mark} during the unbal- ance of
capability---[when only one opposing nuclear power attains this hyper-
fast, defense- penetrating weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. During this
window, tensions will heighten while [adversaries weigh their options,
including a preemp- tive strike to remove this hyper capability from
their foe, a heightened nuclear alert posture that sows seeds for a
crisis, and/or an increase in bellicose rhetoric.]{.underline} There may
well be two options to prevent the regional hypersonics dilemma: quickly
proliferate hypersonic technology to all nuclear powers, or add
hypersonic technology to the Hague Code of Con- duct against Ballistic
Missile Proliferation and/or the Missile Technology Control Regime to
halt hypersonic proliferation. One option is highly improbable and laced
with danger (exporting high-tech weapons to ad- versaries). The other
requires action before the window of technology maturation closes and it
is too late to prevent calamity.

WASHINGTON: [A new **[study]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} US missile
**[defenses]{.mark}** has [found that]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[after
70 years]{.mark} and some \$**350** billion in investment]{.underline}
--- [[no]{.mark} "[system thus **far**]{.mark} developed [has
been]{.mark} shown to be [effective against]{.mark} **realistic [ICBM
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}" to the homeland. It's a conclusion with
which the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency begs to differ.

The study by the [American Physical Society
(**[APS]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[examined]{.underline}]{.mark} a
hypothetical [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean [strike]{.mark} and current
missile defense systems]{.underline}, such as ground-based interceptors,
[[as well as]{.mark} more]{.underline} [[**futuristic** options]{.mark}
in **development**]{.underline}, [[like]{.mark} directed [**energy**
weapons]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [s]{.mark}pace-[b]{.mark}ased
[i]{.mark}nterceptor[s]{.mark}. [It **found**]{.mark} today's
[capabilities inadequate]{.mark} [and future **systems** unlikely to do
the job]{.mark}]{.underline} of defending the country in the next 15
years at least --- even from a small number of North Korean missiles.

"[[Creating]{.mark} a reliable]{.underline} and effective [[**defense**
against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[threat]{.underline} [posed by
even]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[small number]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively unsophisticated [nuclear-armed
**[ICBMs]{.mark}**]{.underline} that it considers [[remains]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} daunting]{.underline} [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}," the
Feb. 9 APS report, called "Ballistic Missile Defense: Threats and
Challenges" finds.

APS is a non-profit membership organization for physicists and
scientists in related fields, founded in 1899. The study was conducted
by a panel that includes a number of scientists who are known for their
support of nuclear arms control. The panel was chaired by Frederick
Lamb, a physics professor at the University of Illinois who has had a
long career in national security and arms control, including advising
the Defense Department.

"The [[difficulties are numerous]{.underline}]{.mark}, ranging
[[from]{.mark} the [unresolved **countermeasures**]{.mark} problem for
midcourse-intercept [to]{.mark} the severe [reach-versus-time
challenge]{.mark} of boost-phase]{.underline} intercept. [[Few]{.mark}
of the main challenges [have been solved]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[[**many** of the]{.mark} hard [problems are likely to remain
**unsolved**]{.mark}]{.underline} during, and probably beyond, the
15-year time horizon the study considered. The [[costs and
benefits]{.mark} of this effort therefore [need to be **weighed**
carefully]{.mark}]{.underline}," the APS study concludes.

In particular, the study asserts that [directed [energy weapons]{.mark}
for intercepting **intercontinental ballistic missiles**]{.underline}
early in their flight [[will not be ready for prime time]{.mark} within
that 15-year period]{.underline}. [As for]{.underline} space-based
interceptors ([[SBIs]{.underline}]{.mark}) --- a concept revitalized
during the Trump administration --- the study finds that
[[hundreds]{.mark} of on-orbit **platforms** [would be needed to
shoot]{.mark} [down]{.mark} only [one]{.mark} of **North Korea's** least
capable ballistic missiles.]{.underline}

Officials from the Missile Defense Agency (**[MDA]{.underline}**)
[contested]{.underline} [the]{.underline} study's
**[conclusions]{.underline}**, however, pointing Breaking Defense to the
most recent report \[PDF\] by the Pentagon's top testing official, the
Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E). That report found
that, taken together, the various missile defense programs are capable
of doing what they are designed to do.

"The Missile Defense System (MDS) has demonstrated a measured capability
to defend the United States, deployed forces, and allies from a rogue
nation's missile attack," the DOT&E report said.

Conclusion

By choice of successive presidential Administrations and Congresses,
[the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [does not have]{.mark} in
place a **[comprehensive]{.mark}** set of **[missile defense]{.mark}**
systems [that]{.mark} [would]{.mark} be capable of [defend]{.mark}ing
the **homeland** and allies [from]{.mark} robust **[ballistic missile
threats]{.mark}** from **Russia** and **China**]{.underline}. [U.S.
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[focused on]{.mark} a [**limited**
architecture]{.mark} [that **protects**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[homeland]{.underline}** [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} quantitatively
**[[small]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
qualitatively relatively [[less advanced
**threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} and on deploying and advancing regional
missile defense systems. The [**U**nited **S**tates has **not invested
in space**]{.underline}-based missile defense in any serious manner.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} in place
**[multiple]{.mark}** types of]{.underline} capable
**[[interceptors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a vast sensor network, and a
command and control system, [[but many elements]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the missile defense system [[need]{.underline} [to be
improved]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to defend]{.underline}]{.mark} against
today's threat [[more **efficiently**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and the
[system would have to be **rethought**]{.mark} from the ground
up]{.underline} should a decision be made [[to **provide**]{.mark} a
[comprehensive]{.mark} layered and robust [defense]{.mark} of the
homeland against Russian and **Chinese** missile threats]{.underline}.
At the same time, the [[development of]{.mark} missile
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, both qualitative and quantitative[, is
[outpacing]{.mark} the [**speed** of]{.mark} missile defense
**[research]{.mark}**, development, and deployment [to
**address**]{.mark} those threats.]{.underline}

Senior [[leaders]{.mark} continue to [stress]{.mark} the [**importance**
of]{.mark} U.S. missile [defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [if the
nation is to **realize** the strategic benefits that missile defense
**provides**]{.underline}, **[Congress]{.underline}** and the
Administration [must ensure]{.underline} that the [**funding** of
critical programs like **NGI**, **space** sensors, and
**JADC2**]{.underline} is commensurate with their importance and that
the nation is investing in future research and development, including
missile defense in space.

#### Missile defense fails. Actual empirics.

[[Once]{.mark} a ballistic [missile]{.mark} [is fired into the]{.mark}
[air]{.mark}, a [defender]{.mark} [has only minutes to identify]{.mark}
its precise **[trajectory]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} try to [shoot it
down]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[The [target]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an enemy warhead, [is [inside an
**object**]{.mark}]{.underline} [about the size of a car]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} typically [**flies** through]{.underline} the [edge
of **space**]{.underline} [at many times the speed of
sound]{.underline}.

Since Friday, [[Iran]{.mark} has been [firing]{.mark}]{.underline} a
barrage of [**[ballistic missiles]{.mark}** at targets across
**Israel**]{.underline}, a reprisal for a devastating surprise attack
the Israeli government launched against Iranian nuclear and military
sites.

[Here's why **stopping** a ballistic missile attack is so
**difficult**.]{.underline}

[Ballistic **[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} like the ones being fired
by Iran [[escape]{.mark} the [atmosphere and **accelerate**]{.mark} to
great speeds as they [fall back **down**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Earth.
It takes only about 12 minutes for Iran's missiles to reach Israel,
analysts estimate. [[There is far less time to make critical
**decisions** about how to stop them]{.underline}.]{.mark}

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

[Within seconds, **[satellites]{.mark}** [must
detect]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[heat]{.mark}**
signature]{.underline} given off by a missile launch. [[Radars must
find]{.mark} the [missile]{.mark}]{.underline} and try to calculate its
exact course.

A [defensive missile called an [**interceptor** must be
fired]{.mark}]{.underline} soon after that to reach the incoming missile
in time.

[That's]{.underline} all [[**hard** enough with one
missile]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But Iran]{.mark} has **been** [firing a
large **volley**]{.mark} of them]{.underline}. The goal appears to be to
overwhelm Israeli defenses.

[**[Radars]{.mark}** can [only track **so many**]{.mark}]{.underline}
targets at once, and launchers, once emptied, may need a half hour or
more to reload.

Beyond that, if they are concerned about future attacks, [targeted
**[countries]{.mark}** may [also need to make a critical
**split-second**]{.mark} [decision]{.mark}]{.underline} to reserve
valuable interceptors only [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [incoming
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} that appear likely to do the most damage.

[Israel's]{.underline} best-known defense system, the [[Iron
Dome]{.underline}]{.mark}, was built to stop short-range rockets, and
[[is]{.mark} too [**slow** and **limited**]{.mark} when it comes to
**ballistic missiles**]{.underline}. For that, Israel relies on several
more advanced layers of defense designed to counter ballistic missiles
at different stages of flight.

The **[most advanced systems]{.underline}**, long-range interceptors
like the Arrow 3, [operate in **space**]{.underline}, [where ballistic
missiles]{.underline} like those Iran fired [**spend** most of their
time]{.underline}. They are the first chance to stop a missile, but high
above the atmosphere, there is no room for error.

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

Both an interceptor and an enemy missile shed the boosters that power
them into space. Just two smaller vehicles remain, hurtling toward each
other.

The interceptor seeks a direct hit to destroy the warhead. To home in,
the interceptor carries sensors to track the enemy missile and thrusters
to move toward it. But [[by the **time** an]{.mark}
[**interceptor**]{.mark} senses its target a **mile** away, [it **has**
only a **split second**]{.mark} to adjust.]{.underline}

That's because missiles like Iran's latest are only about three feet
wide at the base by the time they are in space, and they are traveling
about two miles every second.

If that weren't hard enough, [some ballistic [**missiles
carry** **decoys**]{.mark} [to trick the
**interceptor**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Debris]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[leftover]{.underline}** [from the boosters can [also confuse
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It's unclear how often **interceptions**]{.underline} above the
atmosphere [actually work]{.underline}. [**[Governments]{.mark}** [tend
to avoid **disclosing**]{.mark}]{.underline} specific **[interception
[rates]{.mark},]{.underline}** and [they have every reason
to]{.underline} present a positive picture, [even [when
**interceptions** fail]{.mark}.]{.underline} So do the companies that
manufacture the pricey systems.

[When combined with]{.underline} U.S. **[antimissile
systems]{.underline}** in the region, [Israel currently has the most
layers of **missile** defense in the **world**]{.underline}. [If
outer-layer defenses fail to stop a missile]{.underline}, shorter-range
systems that intercept [**missiles** closer to the ground **may** have
another chance]{.underline}.

But **[[time runs out]{.mark} quickly.]{.underline}** The
[**[closer]{.mark}** a]{.underline} ballistic [**[missile
gets]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the more dangerous it becomes. And even if
a lower-altitude [intercept]{.underline} is successful, the
[[**resulting** **debris** can]{.mark} still [be]{.mark}
[deadly]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If a missile succeeds in re-entering the atmosphere, often less than a
minute remains before it strikes.

[Defenses that work in the upper atmosphere]{.underline} --- like
Israel's Arrow 2 or the THAAD system that the United States recently
sent to Israel --- [must **fire their interceptors within
seconds**]{.underline}.

As the missile nears the ground, [**[close-range defenses]{.mark}** like
the Patriot system from the U.S. [provide a final chance to stop]{.mark}
it. But these systems have a **range** of about **12 miles** and can
only protect **limited** areas.]{.underline}

An attacker can draw on a variety of tactics. [[To **distract**]{.mark}
the enemy, [it]{.mark} [can fire a volley of cheaper]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} timed to arrive at the same time as the
ballistic missiles. This is what Iran tried in its April attack, but
Israel and its allies appear to have been able to triage between the
faster and slower weapons, using other defenses like fighter jets to
counter them.

Last year, too, [**[Iran]{.mark}** fired big **barrages** of missiles at
Israel, but [left]{.mark} [**limited** damage]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
Israel and Iran clashed last year, they fought in short and contained
bursts that usually ended within hours, and both sides looked for
off-ramps that allowed tensions to ebb.

But this time both countries have little incentive to stop and no
obvious route to outright victory.

Over the course of a protracted conflict, it could become a question of
which side runs out of missiles first.

[[Despite]{.mark} the fact that the MDA has received about \$142 billion
in [funding]{.mark} from 2002 to 2017]{.underline} (Government
Accountability Office Citation2019, 1), [the [agency has been
notoriously plagued by]{.mark} a variety of [technical, quality control,
and cultural issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} The MDA has been criticized by
other elements of the US government, including the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) and the Defense Department Inspector
General, [for prioritizing "schedule-driven milestones, rather than
pursuing a knowledge-based approach]{.underline}" (Government
Accountability Office Citation2019, 26).

Particularly with regards to Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), this
approach has [resulted in [systems]{.mark} being [deemed operational
before being fully tested, thus failing to address]{.mark} outstanding
technical [defects]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, a 2014 Defense
Department Inspector General report discovered 48 "nonconformances"
within the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle -- the intercept component of the
Ground-based Midcourse Defense -- that constituted violations of
aerospace standards. Twenty-two of these violations were considered
"major," meaning "a [[nonfulfillment]{.mark} of a requirement that is
likely to [result in]{.mark} the [failure of]{.mark} the quality
management [system or reduce]{.mark} its [ability to ensure controlled
processe]{.mark}s or compliant products/services]{.underline}" (US
Department of Defense Citation2014, 9--10). This likely explains why the
GAO assessed that same system -- which has cost approximately \$67
billion thus far (Reif Citation2019a) -- to have [[achieved "less than
50 percent operational realism]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Government
Accountability Office Citation2019, 59). In the same 2019 report, the
GAO noted that the "MDA did not meet its planned goals," noting that the
MDA only completed 64--70 percent of its planned deliveries and tests
for fiscal year 2018 because of "failures, cancellations, and delays"
(Government Accountability Office Citation2019, I).

Perhaps the [best summation of]{.underline} the MDA's [inefficiency and
wastefulness can be attributed to the GAO]{.underline}, which somewhat
passive-aggressively stated in a recent report: "Our prior work has
shown that stabilizing system design before making major production
commitments and relying on knowledge rather than deadlines to make
acquisition decisions at key milestones are best practices of successful
product developers" (Government Accountability Office Citation2019, 52).

In March 2018, the MDA suddenly decided to classify information about
pending missile defense flight tests, their objectives, and their
timing. However, beyond citing "the need to safeguard critical defense
information," the decision to classify this previously public
information has not been adequately explained (Aftergood Citation2018).
In July 2018, Congress rejected and overrode the MDA's decision, adding
a new provision to the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization
Act that required "that MDA make the quarter and fiscal year of
execution of planned flight tests unclassified" (NDAA Citation2019, Sec.
1681).

Homeland missile defense

The US homeland missile defense system is known as Ground-based
Midcourse Defense, which is [designed to intercept strategic ballistic
missile warheads]{.underline} while they are traveling in their
midcourse phase of flight. The system consists of a multistage
ground-based missile interceptor equipped with an exoatmospheric kill
vehicle. [GMD relies on "hit-to-kill" technology; after separating from
its booster, the kill vehicle seeks out its target]{.underline} in space
[and destroys it through direct collision.]{.underline}

There are currently 44 ground-based interceptors deployed on American
soil: 40 at Fort Greely, Alaska, and four at Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California. The Pentagon is also building a new missile field at Fort
Greely and intends to add 20 more interceptors to the site by 2023 (US
Department of Defense Citation2019a, 43). Since 2012, select Republican
members of the House Armed Services Committee have strongly advocated
for the construction of a third interceptor site on the East Coast
(Stefanik Citation2018), although the commanders of the Missile Defense
Agency and the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile
Defense have stated that "there is no validated military requirement" to
do so (US Department of Defense Citation2013). In June 2019,
Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael D.
Griffin suggested in a House Armed Services Committee memo that Fort
Drum, New York, would be the preferred site because it "provides the
best operational coverage," despite it also being "the [[most expensive
option with]{.mark} the [most environmental
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}." He was careful to note, however, that
"since the Department's 2019 Missile Defense Review determined there is
no operational requirement for an East Coast \[interceptor site\], the
Department has no intent to develop one" (US Department of Defense
Citation2019b).

The GMD system [[relies on an extensive network of ground- and
space-based sensors]{.mark} and radars, including launch detection
satellites]{.underline} like Space-Based Infrared Sensors (SBIRS); the
COBRA DANE radar at Shemya, Alaska; recently-upgraded early warning
radars in California, the United Kingdom, and Greenland; forward-based
X-band radars in Japan; Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers; and
a sea-based X-band radar in the Pacific Ocean (US Department of Defense
Citation2019a, 42). Additionally, Lockheed Martin's construction of a
new long-range discrimination radar began in September 2018, and is
scheduled for deployment at Clear Air Force Station in Alaska in 2020
(Larter Citation2018). Meanwhile, as part of the Upgraded Early Warning
Radar modernization program, the PAVE PAWSFootnote3 radars at Clear,
Alaska and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, will be upgraded by 2023 (Keller
Citation2018). The 2019 Missile Defense Review additionally notes that
two new missile defense radars will be constructed in Hawaii and "in the
Pacific region" by 2023 and 2025, respectively (US Department of Defense
Citation2019a, 43--44). All of these sensors are highly vulnerable to
interception.

Although Boeing, the prime contractor for GMD, describes the system as a
"shield" (CitationBoeing), its [test [record reveals that it is more
likely to function as a sieve. Nearly half (]{.mark}20 out of 44) of the
currently deployed GMD [interceptors are fit]{.mark}ted with the
Capability Enhancement (CE)-I kill vehicle, [which has only succeeded in
two of]{.mark} its [four]{.mark} interceptor [tests]{.mark}]{.underline}
(the most recent of which took place in 2008). Similarly, over a third
of the interceptors (16 out of 44) are fitted with the CE-II kill
vehicle, which also has a 50 percent testing record (Government
Accountability Office Citation2019, 57). What's more, according to the
former head of the MDA, Admiral James Syring, these tests take place "in
a controlled, scripted environment" (Syring Citation2013). Given these
facts and figures, [it seems [highly unlikely that GMD would perform as
advertised]{.mark} when faced with unexpected threats, decoys, and
penetration aids, or multiple targets.]{.underline}

[[Decoys]{.mark} will [pose significant challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the GMD system. In an exoatmospheric vacuum, heavy things and light
things move the same way; therefore, differentiating decoys from reentry
vehicles in space is incredibly difficult. This physics challenge is
compounded by the fact that their lack of combat use means that the
United States has little visibility into what other countries' decoys
look like. The [enormous cost of each interceptor is also a significant
factor.]{.underline} [Utilizing a shoot-look-shoot firing doctrine may
help limit the number of interceptors necessary to shoot down a single
missile]{.underline}; however, in 2012 a National Research Council
report suggested that "this approach is not adequately exploited in
current US midcourse defense systems (such as GMD)" (National Research
Council Citation2012, 103), with recent tests indicating that the MDA is
instead experimenting with "double-tap" salvo launches, in which two
interceptors are fired, and if the first makes a successful intercept,
the second will target the "next most lethal object" (Panda
Citation2019).

The MDA intended to replace the unreliable CE-Is as soon as possible by
expediting the Redesigned Kill Vehicle program, which was scheduled for
deployment between fiscal years 2023 and 2026. However, the GAO's 2019
report to Congress on the [state of US missile defense suggests that
this program was accelerated too quickly because of "advancements in the
North Korea missile threat." As a result, "the [program accepted too
much risk," causing]{.mark} significant technical [delays and
wasting]{.mark} an additional [\$600 million before]{.mark} eventually
[being canceled]{.mark}]{.underline} on May 24th (Government
Accountability Office Citation2019, 60). The cancellation of the
Redesigned Kill Vehicle leaves the GMD program a mess. GMD interceptors
only have an initial service life of 20 years, which the 20
currently-deployed CE-Is will reach in the mid-2020s. With nothing
scheduled to replace them, the GMD program could lose nearly half of its
deployed interceptor arsenal in just over five years.

In late August 2019, the Missile Defense Agency issued a classified
draft request for a Next Generation Interceptor to replace the
Redesigned Kill Vehicle program; it remains unclear how this new
interceptor will differ from the now-canceled one (McLeary
Citation2019). The MDA is also exploring a "multi-object kill vehicle"
as a next-generation kill vehicle, which would allow more than one kill
vehicle to be launched from a single booster. The concept was originally
canceled in 2009, but in 2015 the MDA awarded several contracts with an
intention to develop the multi-object kill vehicle concept further
(Missile Defense Agency Citation2016a, 5).

Scripted [[tests]{.mark} performed [under \"controlled conditions\"
demonstrate]{.mark} that GMD interceptors have a single-hit kill
[effectiveness of]{.mark} just [56 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
all successful interceptions against ICBMs occurring during daytime.
Aegis interceptors have only been tested successfully once against a
short-range ICBM, also [[under optimal conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}
where the launch times and the trajectory for the target missile were
known in advance. Because they were never tested in realistic
conditions, the [[real-world reliability]{.mark} of GMD]{.underline} and
Aegis systems [against sophisticated threats remains
[unknown.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, [[no]{.mark}ne of the
[test]{.mark}s [accounted for]{.mark} the possibility of
[jamming]{.mark} the interceptors or considered [cyber or kinetic
vulnerabilities]{.mark} of the defense]{.underline}. The target missiles
were not allowed attempts to evade interception or carry more than one
warhead. In practice, attacking ICBMs would carry multiple independently
targetable reentry vehicles, each able to target a different location
within some area. The [missiles also could be launched with [unexpected
trajectories]{.mark} or from submarines near the U.S. coast, further
[limiting]{.mark} the system\'s [effectiveness.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
addition, as reentry vehicles containing warheads are released from the
missile payload, the attacker would employ countermeasures designed to
make interception more difficult. For example, some [warheads could be
replaced with cheap, lightweight decoys]{.underline} that can simulate
the radar signature and trajectory of warheads. In LEO there is not much
air resistance, and warheads and decoys move virtually the same, making
discrimination challenging. The [[defender needs to identify decoys and
ignore, or waste interceptors to destroy]{.mark} them.]{.underline}9
Given that there are many imaginative ways to confuse the defender, and
the defender may only learn about the method used at the moment of the
attack, the United States may end up launching some of its
half-billion-dollar interceptors at chaff wires, decoys mimicking the
signature of reentry vehicles, balloons, or bomblets, quickly exhausting
the limited supply of interceptors without fully eliminating the
threat.10 The Many Costs of the Golden Dome In 1985, Reagan\'s arms
control adviser, Paul Nitze, outlined three criteria that a missile
defense system must meet to be successful: It must work, it must be
survivable, and it must remain cost effective at the margin. Most
analyses of ballistic missile defense (BMD) focus on the first two
requirements and examine the technological feasibility of the proposed
systems. The 2011 report by the Federation of American Scientists, the
2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences, the 2016 report by the
Union of Concerned Scientists, and the recently released report by the
American Physical Society all indicate that at the moment, [U.S.
[BMD]{.mark} systems [have]{.mark} [near zero capability against a
large-scale]{.mark} Chinese or Russian [nuclear attack]{.mark}, and only
a very limited capability against a smaller-scale North Korean
attack]{.underline}.11 Shielded from public oversight, however, the U.S.
government appears to have decided that the [nearly half-trillion
dollars spent so far on ballistic missile defense, and the \$200 billion
that was projected to be spent in 2020-2029, are not enough]{.underline}
and that this time is different.12 [Despite decades of
failures]{.underline}, the U.S. national [BMD system, with enough
funding and effort, may yet evolve into a reliable shield against
nuclear ballistic missile atta]{.underline}cks. In a recent analysis,13
we therefore forwent questioning MDA\'s techno-optimistic claims, and
imagined that the technology required for ballistic missile defense with
90 percent overall system effectiveness had been reached, matching the
goal of the GMD and mirroring the claimed effectiveness of the Israeli
Iron Dome, in spite of vastly more demanding requirements.14 It also was
assumed that the systems could not be easily jammed or destroyed by an
adversary and rather than asking how, we asked how much? By accepting
that all things work as advertised and focusing on missile defense
costs, this analysis derived how many dollars the United States would
need to spend to deploy land and ship-based defenses for each dollar
China or Russia spend to field a major scale nuclear attack with their
land-based ballistic missiles. First, based on archival data and by
adjusting for inflation and purchasing power, the cost of a hypothetical
ICBM with adequate range to strike the United States from China or
Russia was estimated at \$42 million, including missile maintenance and
construction of a silo launch facility. The analysis assumed that the
attacker could deliver between 500 and 6,000 warheads, reflecting
estimates of China\'s expanding arsenal and Russia\'s deployed and
retired but not yet dismantled weapons. Next, the analysis
[[estimated]{.mark} the [costs of]{.mark} establishing and maintaining a
U.S. [BMD]{.mark} system]{.underline} built around the planned
ground-based NGIs and ship-based Aegis interceptors. The assumed unit
cost for the NGI interceptor [[was]{.mark} about [\$487
million]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} based on a report released by the
Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office.15 For the Aegis ship
interceptors, the approximate cost was \$60 million per unit, including
the SM-3 Block IIA missile, and its maintenance, and accounting for the
cost of critical subsystems of the Aegis Combat System: the VLS-41
launcher and AN/SPY-6 radar. Finally, a scenario was modeled where the
United States established a two-layered defense, made possible by
geographically distributing Aegis ships near trajectories of Chinese or
Russian missiles. By considering the size of the defense and the attack,
in a two-layered defense the defender can minimize the number of
interceptors by being able to shoot, look to see how many threats have
been destroyed, and shoot again. The BMD system was assigned an overall
effectiveness of 90 percent, while individual interceptor
kill-effectiveness was set at either 50 percent (a more realistic, but
still highly optimistic case) or 90 percent (a wildly optimistic case,
but targeted efficiency). The results show that [[in]{.mark} an [ideal
case]{.mark} for the defender, where interceptors reach 90 percent kill
effectiveness and the system can perfectly reject all countermeasures,
the United States needs to spend on average 8 times more to defend
itself than the attacker needs to spend to build, equip, and launch its
missiles.]{.underline} This scenario assumes that each attacking ICBM
carries five warheads, it excludes the cost of the defender\'s sensors
and ignores past and future projected missile defense technology
development expenditures. Recognizing that U.S. missile defense systems
have not yet been proven to have any capability to discriminate decoys
or identify countermeasures, we accounted for this in a more realistic
scenario by assuming the attacker\'s ICBMs carry two decoys per warhead,
or 15 targets per missile. Because it is speculated that the attacker
could pack many more decoys in the payload and use other
countermeasures, this is still a highly optimistic case. [[With
interceptor kill effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} set at the
demonstrated 50 percent, while still ignoring the costs of development
and external sensors, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates needs to
[spend]{.mark} an average [70 times more than]{.mark} the [attacker,
making defense economically difficult to sustain]{.mark}.]{.underline}
These findings show that even if technical challenges could be overcome
and the efficiency of U.S. national ballistic missile defense against
faster long-range ballistic missiles matched the efficiency of the
Israeli Iron Dome against shorter-range Iranian missiles and drones, the
cost-exchange dynamics still heavily favor the attacker. By extension,
if the United States builds an expensive missile defense system that may
never function as imagined, its adversaries have every incentive to
respond by building nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles that can
overwhelm the defense at a much lower relative cost. The United States
may be able to operate with such an economic disadvantage against North
Korea, but unless nuclear weapon arsenals are reduced dramatically a
successful nuclear offense-defense race against China or Russia is
unlikely to become feasible. As technology improves and production is
expanded, the cost of U.S. interceptors could decrease and match the
cost of an attacker\'s ballistic missiles relying on legacy 1960
technology. Yet, to detect missile launches, track reentry vehicles, and
guide interceptors, the defender still requires a costly network of
radars and space-based sensors. That the cost-exchange dynamics favor
offense was recognized by U.S. military planners since the beginning of
missile defense programs. Relatively [cheap countermeasures can nullify
the effectiveness of any BMD system]{.underline} and, as Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara argued in 1962, \"no amount of money could
make possible an absolute defense against ICBMs.\" Unfortunately,
decisionmaking on U.S. ballistic defense is often steered by political
motivations and economic interests of the military-industrial complex,
making it difficult to constrain the development drives by cost or
strategic considerations. With not much to show for it, by the end of
the decade, the combined U.S. expenditures on ballistic missile defense
since the late 1950s could reach many times more than the cost of the
Manhattan Project, a few times more than landing the first men on the
Moon, and double what is estimated to land humans on Mars. Trump gave
the Pentagon only 60 days to propose an architecture for the Golden
Dome, but it took military contractors even less time to overpromise on
something on which they ultimately will underdeliver. For example,
Lockheed Martin called for a \"Manhattan Project-scale\" effort to
deliver the first Golden Dome within a year. L3Harris praised Trump\'s
bold vision for Golden Dome, urging a dramatic acceleration to adopt
commercial products to a \"catastrophic threat.\" SpaceX, led by Elon
Musk, who also heads administration cost-cutting efforts, reportedly has
teamed up with defense startups Anduril and Palantir to compete for the
Golden Dome contract.16 Reason for the Need When announcing SDI, Reagan
called on the scientific community to develop BMD as a safer, morally
preferable alternative to relying on nuclear deterrence based on mutual
destruction. In 2019, Trump called for a program that can shield every
U.S. city, and has since warned that there is no greater danger than the
menace of nuclear weapons, signaling the need to strengthen U.S.
security without relying on the threat of nuclear retaliation.17 Yet, as
long as nuclear weapons exist, fully eliminating the danger of nuclear
war is not a plausible choice. [[Even if]{.mark} Golden Dome is fully
assembled and [achieves 90 percent interception rate,]{.mark} 10 percent
of incoming warheads would still get through. [In]{.mark} the event of a
[major-scale attack]{.mark}, at least [60 Chinese and 150 Russian
warheads would still strike]{.mark} targets in the United
States.]{.underline} The resulting fallout would inflict catastrophic
damage across the country and trigger a U.S. nuclear response,
regardless of the adversary\'s targeting plans. [Although]{.underline}
there is [no evidence a conflict between nuclear-weapon states would
just fizzle out, there are plenty of indicators to suggest
otherwise]{.underline}. These include the recently declassified 1983
\"Proud Prophet\" wargame, which demonstrated how a limited nuclear war
in Europe likely would escalate rapidly and catastrophically. Air Force
Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, described their
nuclear wargaming exercises in 2017: \"They end the same way every time.
They end badly, with global nuclear war.\" Finally, Trump himself warned
that any nuclear weapon use would mean \"probably oblivion.\"18
[[National ballistic missile defense is technologically unfeasible,
prohibitively costly, and bad for deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Although it may be efficient in \"mopping-up\" missiles from an
adversary\'s limited retaliatory nuclear strike (in the unlikely case a
hypothetical U.S. nuclear first strike manages to take out most of the
other capabilities), this scenario also presumes that adversaries would
passively observe the massive undertaking required to establish an
effective national BMD system. A defense with 90 percent effectiveness
would allow only 10 out of 100 warheads to go through, but a strike
consisting of 1,000 warheads would leak 100. While in a static case a
missile defense system could enhance deterrence by reducing the
adversary\'s confidence that an attack will be successful, if it is not
perfect, it also creates incentives for a nuclear arms race. Unless
constrained by resources, adversaries will attempt to regain lost
confidence by increasing the size of their nuclear arsenals or by
modernizing to improve delivery vehicles.

#### BMD fails---chasing wrong priorities, a structurally flawed architecture and no tests prove it actually works.

Studies (MInSt) from the University of Otago, Dunedin **October 2013**

"Strategic Thinking, Deterrence and the US Ballistic Missile Defense
Project", Pg. 145

Evidence does not support the contention that BMD plays no role in arms
races. Pavel Podvig and Hans M. Kristensen showed how the Soviet
decision to deploy a light ABM system around Moscow in the late 1960s
spurred US development of penetration aids and MIRV missiles even though
the Soviet system was limited, and the CIA and US Navy had concluded
that the Soviet system did not have an effective capability. 36 Herbert
York stated that MIRV was America's response to Soviet BMD and that 100
interceptors had led America to deploy an additional 5,000 warheads. It
was "... fantastically counterproductive and has had anything but a
stabilizing effect." 37 Indeed, in response to the SDI speech Gorbachev
informed Reagan that they had responded by developing the MIRV-capable
Topol-M ICBM, which was "far less expensive than your project, and
\[could\] be ready for use in less time." 38 Findings in the previous
chapter support this historical record, as it found evidence that
'rogues' chose to ramp up their deployments of shortand medium-range
missiles (and invested in BMD countermeasures), while Russia and China
engaged in hard balancing against the US. [[BMD]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[has serious technological shortcomings, evident in the number of
failed tests, delays to deployment and cost
overrun]{.mark}s]{.underline}. In 2003, Undersecretary of Defense E. C.
Aldridge testified to Congress that the system "would perform with 90
percent effectiveness against a missile launched by North Korea"
(Senator Carl Levin immediately responded that the classified numbers
did not support this). 39 However, in spite of inconsistent test
results, Bush confidently told a crowd in August 2004 that the US was
saying to 'rogues,' if "You fire, we're going to shoot it down." 40 In
response, former Pentagon chief of testing Philip Coyle explained: "Of
course we don't have any capability to do that. For the president to
sort of dare them is really misleading and even reckless." 41 In 2004
when responding to questions about effectiveness, MDA Director Ron
Kadish replied "I can give answers, and very-well calculated and
technical answers ... But that gives information that would necessarily
compromise the system in terms of its deterrence and the use of it." 42
A 2005 Final Report of the BMD Agency's Independent Review Team made
clear that this was reducing the dissuasive and deterrence potential of
the system. It therefore recommended reducing future flight test s, and
simplifying them since a perception of "Successful test intercepts" was
a "strategic issue." 43 In July 2006, after North Korea had fired
missiles into the Sea of Japan, (and the system was activated for the
first time) head of the MDA Lieutenant General Henry Obering, said "I am
confident \[the system\] would have worked." 44 These comments were made
even though since Bush's December 2002 decision to deploy the GMD system
only one out of three successful intercept tests had been conducted
(only five out of ten had been successful since 1999). 45 By 2007, and
after \$41bn spent since 2000, promised air, sea, space, and mobile
land-based systems to counter ICBMs had not materialized while some
experimental systems (the ABL and Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI), and
a space-based tested bed, were cancelled. 46 The two systems that could
be declared on schedule were the Naval Aegis and land-based THAAD TMD
systems. But these are not free of criticism either. For example, the
MDA's official flight record of Aegis shows that from January 2002 to
October 2010 the system made 17 out of 22 successful intercepts (the GMD
system had 8 out of 15 successful intercepts during this period). But
according to George Lewis and Theodore Postol the test data shows that
the "[the vast majority of 's[uccessful]{.mark}' SM-3 [experiments would
have failed to destroy attacking warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}," reveals
how [US adversaries could overcome the]{.underline} [system with simple
decoys.]{.underline} 47 Furthermore, they hold that [in 8 or 9 of the 10
'successful']{.underline} Aegis [intercepts, the warhead would not have
been destroyed.]{.underline} The MDA responded with a rejoinder,
claiming Lewis and Postol were wrong and the break-up of the missile's
body would have destroyed the warhead. Postol responded that the mock
warheads used (which were only used in six of the ten tests) would
likely be far weaker than ones attached to real ICBMs, which are
designed to withstand atmospheric re-entry. 48 Although the MDA did
succeed in stationing a handful of GMD interceptors in Alaska in 2004,
in 2008 an Institute for Defense Analyses report said "achievement was
facilitated by the limited goal of an initial capability without
specific performance requirements." 49 Furthermore, in 2008 another GAO
report stated it was subject to cost overruns, had failed to achieve six
testing objectives in 2008 and the 24 GMD interceptors were being
deployed before being fully tested. It noted that BMD programs had
experienced delays and "comprehensive assessments of the capabilities
and limitations of the \[BMD system\] are not currently possible." 50
The report concluded that [insufficient testing meant that the system
could not "... provide a high level of confidence that]{.underline} \[US
[BMD\] can reliably intercept ICBMs]{.underline}." [51 Empirical
evidence of]{.underline} the systems [efficacy in wartime
is]{.underline} l[acking]{.underline} -- only the short-range Patriot
system had been used (and found wanting) in the two Gulf Wars. 52
Furthermore, the Patriot system 'succeeded' in 17 tests prior to its
first real-world use in the First Gulf War. 53 Therefore [tests do not
provide a reliable base]{.underline} from which [to judge]{.underline}
the efficacy of newly deployed [BMD]{.underline} and a number of
prominent members of the American scientific community extolled the
incoming Obama administration to "restore scientific integrity in
government decision making," since in their view "no defensive
capability, even in principle ," existed. 54 As such, original lofty
goals that BMD would "redefine war" and help "skip a generation of
technology" were not supported by the system's failings, and by the end
of the Bush administration scientists such as Lisbeth Grunlund concluded
that "the United States is no closer today to being able to effectively
defend against long-range ballistic missiles than it was 25 years ago."
55 The "more mature" systems Obama emphasized have not been free from
controversy either. In September 2012 the National Research Council
(NRC) recommended the GMD system be redesigned and rebuilt, to include a
faster missile booster, heavier interceptor and new sensors. 56 This
could take up to a decade to build and would require a third GMD site on
the East Coast to provide adequate coverage. 57 Another report by the
DSB said boost-phase defenses, often held to be the best way to
intercept missiles, were not currently feasible. 58 A GAO report
criticized 'spiral deployment,' for producing key hardware before
"critical technologies were fully understood," and before sufficient
flight tests to verify performance had taken place. 59 On this point
Philip Coyle, former Associate Director for National Security and
International Affairs in the Obama administration's Office of Science
and Technology Policy believes that "MDA and its prime contractors,
supported by many in Congress, are focused on producing and fielding
hardware rather than facing up to the physical realities of missile
defense." 60 He goes on to criticize the rapid deployments of EPAA
assets, noting that the DSB report states that the Aegis SPY-1 radar "is
inadequate to support the objective needs of the EPAA mission," and the
TPY-2 land-based radar in Turkey "needs to be twice as big and mounted
on a turntable so it can see in more than one direction." 61 He
concludes that [the system is "chasing scientific dead ends, unworkable
concepts and a flawed overall architecture."]{.underline} 62 One of the
necessary pillars that make BMD a supposed moral investment is the
contention they will work with a high degree of effectiveness. But as
the above makes clear, this is not at all certain. A related moral basis
for BMD is the perception that it is purely defensive. But this only
obtains in isolation from the larger strategic plans it is integrated
into. The 2002 NPR linked BMD to offensive strike systems in the New
Triad, while the Bush Doctrine of pre-emption, which actually conflated
the legally dubious action of prevention, suggested BMD could come into
use in future US-initiated military operations. At the grand strategic
level, BMD might heighten the likelihood of ideologically-based foreign
policies emphasizing offensive regime change, by reducing the risks of
launching preemptive or preventing strikes. Finally, the 'imminent
threat' argumentative line that has been used as a moral rationale for
deploying BMD to defend against 'rogue' ICBMs continues to be suspect.
In December 2012 a CRS report stated that it was "increasingly
uncertain" that Iran would be able to test an ICBM by 2015, while the
majority of Pyongyang's last few ICBM tests have been failures. 63
Together, the above factors significantly weaken the moral case for BMD
and, at the least, make its moral legitimacy far more ambiguous.

Then, too, there are serious considerations regarding actual "realistic
operational conditions" that are rarely mentioned. [Any adversary's use
of several ICBMs to challenge America's]{.underline} ballistic [missile
defenses would involve nuclear warheads]{.underline}; the [BMDs are not
designed to intercept scores of bomblets loaded with biological
weapons]{.mark}. In the case of such an ICBM attack, some enemy warheads
could breach U.S. defense and reach their target, some enemy missiles
may be equipped with warhead fuses that trigger the warhead just before
defensive interceptors arrive, and [some]{.mark} enemy [warheads may
explode when hit by an interceptor]{.mark}. [Any nuclear weapons that
were triggered would [produce mushroom clouds, blast, neutrons, x-rays,
and fire storms, creating a disruptive nuclear environment]{.mark}.
Such]{.underline} an environment [could [affect]{.mark} missile defense
[interceptors, satellites, and]{.mark} command and control
installations, especially [radars.]{.mark} Apart from the potentially
chaotic nuclear environment, [realistic]{.mark} operational
[conditions]{.mark} [include]{.mark} the]{.underline} other [dizzying
aspects of warfighting and the [fog of war]{.mark} that
include]{.underline} such events as [[bad weather]{.mark} or [the
angle]{.mark} of the [sun relative to]{.mark} infrared [sensors.]{.mark}
Although U.S. officials]{.underline} have [frequently made exaggerated
claims about]{.underline} the [reliability and dependability
of]{.underline} the nation's [antimissile systems, they seldom consider
the very real difficulties of trying to maintain BMD systems during a
nuclear assault]{.underline}. As the director of Operational Test and
Evaluation described it in the Survivability section of his January 2009
report to Congress, "Specific assets are unhardened to nuclear,
biological, or chemical attack." 6

questions about missile defense,"
https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/congress-is-not-asking-the-right-questions-about-missile-defense/

The current missile defense system intended to protect the continental
United States is the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System (GMD). [GMD's
spotty track record in scripted tests is well known]{.underline}. While
Congress should question the system's exorbitant costs and lackluster
performance, a better question would be: Should the United States be
pursuing this capability at all?

A poor track record. [As currently constituted, the [US national missile
defense]{.mark}]{.underline} system [[is not
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent [claims]{.underline} in
Congressional testimony that [the [system is 97 percent capable
assume]{.mark} a "shot doctrine" in which [multiple interceptors would
have to be launched]{.mark} for every incoming warhead, because some of
the interceptors are likely to miss. But **no real enemy would attack
piecemeal**, rather than with a barrage of incoming missiles to
overwhelm US defenses]{.underline}. Also, the claim of 97 percent
effectiveness assumes the reasons for failure are not common to all
interceptors. [A simple [design flaw]{.mark} would]{.underline} quickly
**[[reduce]{.mark} the system's [effectiveness from 97 percent to
0]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Since the GMD program began testing in 1999, 19 flight intercept tests
have been conducted, with 11 of them deemed successful by the Missile
Defense Agency, representing a roughly 58 percent success rate. More
recently, GMD has done no better. [[Of the six]{.underline}]{.mark}
flight intercept [[tests]{.underline}]{.mark} conducted
[since]{.underline} the beginning of [2010]{.underline}, only **[[three
have been successful]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in the latest test, two
interceptors were launched, and both killed their intended targets). You
read that right. For the eye-popping cost so far of nearly \$70 billion,
the United States is fielding a missile defense system that fails about
half the time.

[Even with a heavy thumb on the scale]{.underline}, the
**[M]{.underline}**issile **[D]{.underline}**efense
**[A]{.underline}**gency [has not been able to]{.underline} prove it can
[reliably shoot down a missile]{.underline}. The agency acknowledges
that its **[tests are scripted for success]{.underline}**. This is
understandable: [[Missile defense tests are expensive, and **failures
undermine**]{.mark} **the [credibility of]{.mark} the [system]{.mark}**.
Nonetheless, the fact that [GMD **has such poor performance despite
being optimized for success** only makes its test record more
alarming]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

This whole mess could, and should, have been anticipated. The George W.
[Bush]{.underline} administration [rushed to deploy GMD, knowing it
didn't work but choosing to fix the system along the
way]{.underline}---a process the administration called "spiral
development." In practice **[[it is a spiral
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leading to numerous setbacks and sunken
costs. The Missile Defense Agency recently announced [it will be
canceling work on the Redesigned Kill Vehicle]{.underline}, citing
technical difficulties that are "effectively insurmountable." After 20
years of work, [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[doesn't even have a reliable kill vehicle]{.underline}**. This is
unacceptable.

Control and Non-Proliferation,
https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-u-s-ballistic-missile-defense/)**

Ballistic missile defense systems seek to defend a given area from
attack by locating and tracking an incoming ballistic missile and then
launching an interceptor to destroy the missile before it can reach its
target. All U.S. interceptors are made up of a booster rocket and a kill
vehicle. While most interceptors are "hit-to-kill," meaning the kill
vehicle crashes into the incoming missile to destroy them, others use a
blast fragmentation warhead that detonates an explosive charge and
sprays shrapnel in the hopes of detonating the payload in the incoming
missile. The United States employs missile defenses that launch both
types of interceptors. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has worked
to develop and deploy a number of such systems to defend the homeland,
allies and assets abroad. In this vein, the United States has developed
three theater (regional) systems and one to protect the homeland, the
Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. Theater Ballistic Missile
Defense systems target incoming short-, medium- and intermediate-range
ballistic missiles. These systems include the land-based Patriot
Advanced Capability (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD) systems deployed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and the
sea-based Aegis system, although the Aegis Ashore can be deployed on
land. The GMD system aims to protect the U.S. homeland from a limited
number of intermediate and long-range ballistic missiles by destroying
the incoming warhead in its midcourse phase, outside of the Earth's
atmosphere. It is designed to be effective against an accidental or
rogue missile launch and not against the strategic deterrents of Russia
and China. First deployed in 2004, this system currently comprises 44
groundbased interceptors at Fort Greely in Alaska and at Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California, in addition to associated satellite and radar
systems. The [Next Generation Interceptor program, currently being
implemented, would produce 31 new interceptors]{.underline} to replace
current interceptors in Fort Greely and Vandenberg Air Force Base for
more advanced interceptor systems. These [[new interceptors]{.mark} are
[expected to cost]{.mark} \$498 million each totaling [\$18
billion]{.mark} over the life of the program]{.underline}. They are
currently planned to be fielded in 2027 or 2028. The [Pentagon is also
spending \$1.5 billion on a new missile and air shield for
Guam]{.underline} in FY 2024. The existing system was announced to
defend Guam against North Korean threats, but this new development is
set to defend against Chinese threats. Guam is currently protected by
the Army's THAAD ballistic missile defense system and the Navy's Aegis
system. The United States' deterrence strategy proclaims that offensive
nuclear weapons deter nuclear weapon states, like Russia and China, and
U.S. missile defenses are meant to protect against rogue state threats,
like North Korea. Under the Trump administration, the United States
shifted its strategy toward creating a [[layered missile defense
system]{.underline}]{.mark} that plans to integrate the systems deployed
abroad with those deployed at home. Although [still [not effective
against large scale attacks]{.mark}, the adjustment was intended to
increase protection in light of continued development of missile
capabilities]{.underline}, including cruise and hypersonic weapons. In
October 2022, the Biden administration released its Missile Defense
Review, which outlines integrated deterrence that incorporates
diplomacy, missile defense, and nuclear capabilities. [[Nuclear
weapons]{.mark} are stated to be the [credible threat to deter attacks,
while missile defense is deterrence by denial]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
missile defense strategy prioritizes the modernization and expansion of
the GMD system and strengthening regional defense and deterrence in
cooperation with Allies. armscontrolcenter.org How do these systems
work? While engaging hypersonic and cruise missiles requires defending
areas, ballistic missile defense considers engaging threats during three
stages: the boost phase, the midcourse phase and the terminal phase of
flight. Boost-phase defense encompasses engagements while the booster
rocket is still accelerating. The midcourse defense layer can be divided
into 1) the ascent phase, when the incoming missile is engaged prior to
apogee; 2) the descent phase, when intercept occurs after apogee; 3) and
finally, the terminal phase refers to engagements as and after warheads
reenter the atmosphere and become subject to drag and reentry heating.
[Engagements in the boost phase are ideal but very difficult because
there is such a short time period to make a decision]{.underline}.
Boost-phase engagements also require engagement by systems that are
deployed near enemy territory, which can undermine the strategic
deterrents of adversaries. Presently, the [United States does not have
this technology and it was found not to be "practical or
feasible"]{.underline} by the National Academy of Sciences. Terminal
defense is dangerous because it is the last shot at interception. The
PAC-3, THAAD and Aegis systems all target the terminal phase. In
November 2020, the Aegis SM-3 Block IIA was tested against an ICBM-class
target and deemed successful, although it was not conducted under
real-world conditions. The U.S. GMD system, as its name dictates, seeks
to engage incoming missiles in the midcourse layer. It relies on an
extensive network of ground- and space-based sensors and radars, which
are deployed from Greenland to Japan, and from the Pacific Ocean to
launch detection satellites orbiting the Earth. Do these systems work?
Despite the assurances of MDA officials, presently, these defense
systems have an uneven testing record. The [[G]{.mark}overnment
[A]{.mark}ccountability [O]{.mark}ffice [found]{.mark}]{.underline} that
the [[MDA failed to mee]{.mark}t its planned [testing goals]{.mark} in
fiscal year (FY) 2019 [due to]{.mark}]{.underline} significant
[development [delays]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The [lack of
testing]{.mark} is problematic as it [results in less data to validate
system]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}. These [failures are
particularly [concerning given]{.mark}]{.underline} the MDA's [[\$199
billion in funding from 2002 to 2023]{.underline}]{.mark} and requested
\$[[55 billion from]{.mark} FY [2024 through 2028]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is an [increase of \$8 billion from the requested \$47
billion]{.underline} from FY 2019 through 2023. In the tests that have
occurred, the [GMD system has an approximate [50% success
rate]{.mark}]{.underline} in scripted tests and replacements for these
weapons are years away. In October of 2019, the Pentagon terminated its
Redesigned Kill Vehicle program, intended for deployment in 2023, to
augment and replace the GMD's outdated and unreliable interceptors, due
to technical design flaws. From the limited information publicly
available, it is difficult to assess whether 50% can be considered
successful, as valuable data can be derived from any test regardless of
its success. What is clear, however, is that [[GMD is expensive and
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, apparently, [[meeting its
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. The MDA enacted \$2.8 billion in FY 2023 and
requested an additional \$3.25 billion in FY 2024 for existing GMD and
the development of the Next-Generation Interceptor. In the interim,
Congress has asked MDA to field a separate interceptor by 2026. [There
is a long list of expensive agency flops,]{.underline} including \$2.2
billion for a failed sea-based radar, \$5.3 billion on a scrapped
chemical laser system, and \$2.7 billion on an ineffective blimp-based
radar system. While the theater missile systems have a better testing
record, they are not immune to reliability concerns. Up until 2006,
THAAD had an exceedingly poor testing record of 2 out of 16, but since
then, its testing record has improved to 16 out of 16. The Aegis
continues to have a mixed record of 34 successes out of 43 attempts. The
PAC-3's record is quite poor in the field, and the numbers from the
Pentagon are highly disputed. armscontrolcenter.org Threat to strategic
stability and arms control In theory, effective missile defense should
increase homeland security. However, the [system is [only effective
against small scale threats]{.mark} and provides]{.underline}
essentially [zero protection against attack by a larger
adversary]{.underline} such as Russia. Furthermore, both [[Russia and
China]{.mark} have [cited U.S. missile defenses, and]{.mark} [the lack
of transparency]{.mark} around them, [as justifications for
building]{.mark} their own [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- an effort to blame the U.S. for an arms race they are running.
Russia has also cited U.S. missile defense as a reason for its
reluctance to engage in further arms control. Specifically, Moscow and
Beijing profess concern about the Aegis SM3-Block IIA, which the United
States tested against an ICBM-class target in November 2020. The United
States plans to deploy the system in Poland and complete construction on
Aegis Ashore Poland in 2023, ostensibly to counter a future potential
Iranian threat, and in the Asia pacific. Later in 2023, technical
capability declaration is expected, meaning that all major components of
the system are installed and ready to begin integration. However,
[[Russia and China]{.mark} have [respond]{.mark}ed [with]{.mark} a wide
array of [new missile capabilit]{.mark}ies [that are advertised]{.mark}
as [to defeat U.S. missile defense systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although the [U.S. has extremely limited effective defense against
Russian or Chinese strategic forces, the [imagined threats]{.mark} to
such capabilities are being used to [fuel an arms race that could
undermine]{.mark} the [stability of nuclear
deterrents]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Domain awareness fails 

### Domain Awareness fails 

#### Arctic conditions plus alt causes mean even BMD can't solve domain awareness.

**Tingstad '23 visiting professor of the arctic (Abbie, 11/29/23,

<https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CTA3097-1.html>**) / keyron**

Fourth, U.S. presence cannot be scaled up without trained personnel,
domain awareness, communications, and logistics. For many, the concept
of armed forces' presence denotes physical and technological
capabilities: ships, submarines, aircraft, ground vehicles, and similar
platforms. There is no doubt that investment in such platforms would
greatly promote U.S. Arctic access and presence. Yet, our study
emphasized four other types of essential capabilities without which
next-generation or recapitalized platforms would not be effective or
even operational: trained personnel, domain awareness, communications,
and logistics. [[Personnel need to be acclimated to]{.mark} operating in
the [extreme Arctic environment, where]{.mark} even [basic]{.mark}
operational [tasks can be difficult]{.mark}. Domain [awareness remains
limited owing]{.mark} to the [use of a single]{.mark} Arctic-dedicated
[icebreaker]{.mark} (USCGC Healy), [few
overflights]{.mark},]{.underline} and relatively few early-warning
stations. [Polar [conditions and poor infrastructure]{.mark} [hamper
communications]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[logistics suffer from few
roads and]{.mark} viable [airstrips]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fifth, the
Arctic physical environment will continue to be a formidable adversary.
Protecting the armed forces during their missions to secure the United
States' interests in the Arctic region is of utmost importance. Although
there are various military threats, such as antiship and antiaircraft
missiles, our research suggests that the likeliest and
most-consequential threats will come from the Arctic's physical
environment and the [[present lack of capability, capacity]{.mark}, and
preparedness for dealing with these challenges. The [dangers of]{.mark}
navigating through vast, poorly charted areas with [extreme
weather]{.mark} conditions;]{.underline} operating in a data vacuum with
limited communications; and lacking personnel trained and ready to
persist in a harsh, logisticspoor environment are---and will continue to
be---formidable.

#### Because of a lack of icebreakers, building in the arctic is [impossible]{.underline} and [useless]{.underline} -- proves domain awareness fails.

The planet is warming and ice is melting in the Arctic^1)^ at an
alarming rate. But contrary to what may seem like common sense, the
United States' building of new icebreakers will not be waging
yesterday's war today. Regardless of humanity's failures in the battle
against climate change, [[there]{.mark} will be [a lot of ice to break
in the Arctic^2^]{.mark}]{.underline}^)^ for the foreseeable future and
even melting ice^3)^ poses significant danger to vessels. [[The United
States is]{.mark} woefully [behind]{.mark} its fellow Arctic States [in
building]{.mark} and maintaining a world-class fleet of
[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline} and, thanks to various issues^4)^ and
construction delays,^5)^ it might be another five years or more until
the Coast Guard's first new Polar Security Cutter (PSC)^6)^ is fully
operational and breaking ice in the Arctic. In the meantime, Arctic
shipping will continue to increase,^7)^ fish stocks will flow further
North,^8)^ and continental shelves^9)^ will continue to be exploited for
more resources. [With all of this activity, the demand for Arctic
infrastructure will grow, especially deepwater ports capable of
servicing the ships engaged in these expanding fields]{.underline}. [But
[without icebreakers, building]{.mark} all of this infrastructure
[is]{.mark} a bit [like hosting]{.mark} a [baseball]{.mark} game
[without]{.mark} any [bats]{.mark}. [Icebreakers]{.mark} are [key
to]{.mark} the maritime [transportation]{.mark} system and]{.underline}
infrastructure of the Great Lakes^10)^ and New England,^11)^ clearing
the way for vital heating oil shipments and critical goods throughout
both regions. With planning and a bit of luck, Alaska will join the
robust economic activity that these regions enjoy. There was a brief
glimmer of hope that this issue was being taken seriously in the Trump
Administration when it released a seemingly potent 2020 memorandum^12)^
on safeguarding U.S. national interests at both poles. The memo breathed
fresh life into the effort to accelerate the U.S. Coast Guard's
icebreaker acquisition program, while seeking bridging solutions to fill
the gaps until that acquisition program could be completed, including a
novel effort to lease icebreakers^13)^ from fellow Arctic State and
strategic partner, Finland. Unfortunately, like many efforts, both good
and bad, during that Administration, they failed to "stick the landing".
The effort died with little result or change in trajectory.

[The [DHS Strategy articulates]{.mark}]{.underline} three [main
[EMP]{.mark}]{.underline}/GMD [risk [mitigation
goals]{.mark}]{.underline} with key objectives identified under each
goal.9

GOAL 1: [Improve risk awareness of electromagnetic threats and
hazards.]{.underline} 10

DHS and critical stakeholders use technically informed risk assessments
to support the electromagnetic-hazard research agenda, preparedness
planning initiatives, and leadership decision-making.

Goal 1 Objectives

1.  [[Improve]{.mark} EMP-related [intelligence
    gathering]{.mark},]{.underline} technical [analysis]{.underline},
    [and info]{.underline}rmation [sharing to improve DHS
    and]{.underline} critical infrastructure [stakeholder understanding
    of the EMP threat.]{.underline}

2.  [[Increase coordination of]{.mark}]{.underline} intra-Departmental,
    Federal interagency, and civilian scientific [[research]{.mark} on
    EMP]{.underline} and GMD [and their effects on critical
    infrastructure.]{.underline}

3.  [[Provide]{.mark} timely distribution of [info]{.mark}rmation [on

DHS supports federal and industry partners to assure resilience of
critical infrastructure and continuity of lifeline services and
economically essential trade and commerce activities.

Goal 2 Objectives

2.1 [[Identify]{.underline}]{.mark} the [national critical
[functions]{.mark} and associated infrastructure [that need to be
protected against]{.mark} [an]{.mark} extreme [electromagnetic
incident]{.mark}, assess the systemic risk]{.underline} to these
functions and infrastructure [from such incidents, and determine whether
existing plans meet the requirements for an]{.underline} [effective
recovery]{.underline}.

2.2 [[Increase the rigor]{.mark} and volume [of]{.mark} analytical
efforts to support advanced capabilities development for
EMP]{.underline}-GMD [[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}, response, and
recovery measures.

2.3 [Identify and promote technological advances likely to significantly
enhance resilience]{.underline} or reduce vulnerability of critical
infrastructure to electromagnetic incidents.

GOAL 3: [Promote effective electromagnetic-incident response and
recovery efforts.]{.underline}

DHS supports national response and recovery efforts following an
electromagnetic incident, including government continuity operations and
mission-essential functions.

Goal 3 Objectives

3.1 [Establish and maintain the capability to compile, analyze, and
share electromagnetic incident information to enable]{.underline}
appropriate [response]{.underline} and recovery [operations]{.underline}

plans]{.mark} [to enable]{.mark}]{.underline} effective and efficient
[[recovery operations]{.mark} across]{.underline} Federal, state, local,
tribal, and territorial (FSLTT) [governments]{.underline}, critical
owners and operators, and, as appropriate, with international,
nongovernmental, and private sector partners.

3.4 [Provide recovery support and [conduct long-term
mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} actions to promote resilience.

3.5 [Ensure DHS is able to preserve the continuity of operations of
primary mission-essential functions following an electromagnetic
incident.]{.underline}

Implementation

[[DHS will]{.mark} use the DHS Strategy]{.underline} and corresponding
Implementation Plan [to]{.underline} identify, assign,
[[execute]{.underline}]{.mark}, and track [prioritized [actions that
will drive]{.mark}]{.underline} our comprehensive and coordinated
[national [EMP]{.mark}]{.underline}-GMD [[protection
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This]{.underline} Strategy
[will]{.underline} also [inform Departmental resource allocation
decisions]{.underline}, beginning with associated budget processes for
FY 2020. Relevant DHS Office and Component heads will receive annual
progress reports from the DHS Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans
regarding the implementation of the DHS Strategy. In FY 2018/2019, DHS
will develop the companion Implementation Plan, including outlining lead
and support roles, responsibilities, programs, and timelines for meeting
the DHS Strategy's goals and objectives. DHS will utilize this Strategy
and the Implementation Plan to support capability gap analyses and
requirements generation.

### Heg Fails

#### Heg is unsustainable, bound to fail, and destabilizing

**Desch 22**, non-resident senior fellow at Defense Priorities and
Packey J. Dee professor of international relations at the University of
Notre Dame and Brian and Jeannelle Brady Family director of the Notre
Dame International Security Center. (Michael Desch, July 19, 2022, "War
is a choice, not a trap: the right lessons from Thucydides," Defense
Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/war-is-a-choice-not-a-trap-the-right-lessons-from-thucydides/)//sms-ak

The other approach would set a more realistic goal for the United States
in response [to]{.underline} the rise of China: [work to maintain a
balance of power]{.underline}. This choice, in turn, [hinges on a
central issue in international relations theory: Is a concentration of
power the natural equilibrium]{.underline}, hence it is the case that
great powers, and perhaps lesser powers, should seek hegemony? [Or is a
balance of power the best situation]{.underline} and the most that great
powers can reasonably aspire to and maintain?28 The "[balance of
power"]{.underline} [refers to an equilibrium of peace between
states]{.underline} or groups of them maintained by the military
policies of each side.29 [The latter is the lesson readers should take
away from Thucydides' chronicle]{.underline} of the great war between
Athens and Sparta.

\[image omitted\]

A careful reading of Thucydides shows that he inclines toward the latter
view. [**[Power maximization strategies are unsustainable]{.mark}**
because [they tempt]{.mark} **powerful** [states to
**overreach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Athens did in Sicily in Books VI
and VII. [Given that]{.underline} propensity, [other actors will balance
against it]{.underline}, as do Sparta and its allies in the
Peloponnesian League in Book I, the Sicilian Greek colonies in Books VI
and VII, and dissatisfied members of the Athenian empire in Book VIII.
Thucydides is also skeptical that benign hegemony is a stable situation
long-term. Athens, which led the Greeks against the Persians and founded
the Delian League as a voluntary alliance, soon gave way to the tyranny
that reached its nadir at the Melian Dialogue in Book V. Given that,
Thucydides' message, while not identical to a restrained balance of
power realism, seems most compatible with it.30

Such a reading of Thucydides suggests [[U.S. efforts]{.mark} to maintain
its hegemonic position,]{.underline} either unilaterally or through
popular consent, **[[are bound to fail.]{.underline}]{.mark}**31 The
post-Cold War "unipolar moment" is an artifact of the sudden and
unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar system. [By virtue of its
large population and high level of economic growth, China is soon to
replace the Soviet Union as another pole]{.underline} in the
twenty-first century international system. [[The]{.mark} interesting
[question]{.mark} now [is not]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**how much longer
unipolarity will last** but whether it will be replaced with a bipolar
or multipolar system]{.underline}]{.mark}. And if it in fact turns out
to be bipolar, why would not structural theory lead us to see how it
might be stable---defined in terms of the absence of great power
war---in the same way the Cold War was?32

\[figure omitted\]

[One of the most important causes of hegemonic wars]{.underline} in the
wake of power transitions [is the "security dilemma]{.underline}," the
ubiquitous yet unintended dynamic in which the efforts one state takes
to ensure its security invariably undermine that of other states.33
[While in an anarchical international system, [the security
dilemma]{.mark} can never be eliminated**, it [can be
mitigated]{.mark}**]{.underline} in many cases [**[by]{.mark} the
[policies states embrace]{.mark}**. Thucydides thinks]{.underline} the
Peloponnesian [[War results from]{.mark} t]{.underline}he [[breakdown
of]{.mark} the balance of power]{.underline} between Athens and Sparta
[and]{.underline} he [applauds]{.underline} Pericles' [efforts to try to
reestablish it through [restraint]{.mark}.]{.underline}

How to balance the dragon

[Not only is [a balance of power strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}---like
offshore balancing or restraint---[less likely to exacerbate the
security dilemma]{.underline}, [it [is]{.mark} eminently [**more
feasible** and]{.mark} [will **better serve**]{.mark} **American
[security]{.mark}**]{.underline} and prosperity interests. Both offshore
balancing and restraint are based upon balance of power theories of
international relations. Where they differ is on the specific values of
the variables in the strategic equation (does current technology favor
offense or defense, the specific geography involved, the strength of the
adversary, and the capabilities of the other members of the balancing
coalition?) that would lead us to think the United States, or any other
hegemon, needs to take a more or less active role in balancing or
whether they can rely more on the efforts of the other states in its
coalition.34

As Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War suggests, [a balance of
power approach by the United States]{.underline} in its contemporary
rivalry [with China will be]{.underline} more **[effective and less
destabilizing]{.underline}**. The key reason it will do so is [it builds
upon a number of well-established facts about how international politics
operates]{.underline}, which we have known for more than 2,500 years.35
First, [in most cases, states balance against threats, rather than
bandwagoning]{.underline}--throwing their lot in with a stronger state
in hopes that fealty rather than military capability will preserve their
security.36 [As China grows more powerful and]{.underline} assertive,
[states closest to it are feeling a greater sense of peril. Their
response will be to seek ways to mitigate that threat by
counterbalancing it,]{.underline} particularly in concert with the
United States. [[A less]{.mark} forward and [assertive U.S. posture
will]{.mark}]{.underline} not only mitigate the security dilemma with
China but also [[dampen]{.mark} common pathologies of balancing such as
[buck-passing]{.mark} by allies]{.underline} to the larger power
[[and]{.mark} otherwise [under-providing for their own
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} common [problem behind
both is]{.underline} what economists call "moral hazard," or [the
propensity of [actors]{.mark} to [behave **recklessly** if another is
insuring them]{.mark} against its]{.underline}
[consequences]{.underline}.37

\[image omitted\]

Second, [geography matters.]{.underline} While [[power degrades as a
function of distance]{.underline}]{.mark} it also is diluted by dense
forests, high mountain ranges, and especially wide bodies of water.38
[[The U.S.-China rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark}, in contrast to the Cold
War with the Soviet Union, [[will be waged]{.mark} [across]{.mark} wide
[moats]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than contiguous borders, [[so it
is]{.mark} even [less likely to deteriorate into]{.mark} hegemonic
[war]{.mark}. Taiwan]{.underline}, for example, [is further from
mainland China than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe
and]{.underline} about [the same distance Cuba was from Cold War
Florida. Despite these]{.underline} relatively [short distances**,
neither was ever successfully invaded.**]{.underline}

Third, it is true the United States opened a considerable gap in nuclear
capability between itself and other major nuclear powers, such as Russia
and especially China, that leads some to believe that the United States
could fight and win a nuclear war, especially with the latter.39 But
given that both the United States and China have substantial [nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}, the Nuclear Revolution should further [reduce
the chances of major war between them]{.underline}, in much the same way
it kept the Cold War from turning hot.40 Indeed, even when the United
States had an even greater nuclear advantage over the Soviet Union than
it has over China today, and in the face of multiple serious crises, it
never executed a preemptive nuclear first strike.41

Fourth, [states' strategic choices matter]{.underline}, particularly in
how they choose to arm themselves, and that will continue to be true in
the twenty-first century. [Many fret that recent Chinese]{.underline}
investments in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) [technologies make it
harder for the United States to]{.underline} continue to [project power
close to China. However, these same technologies]{.underline} could also
[bolster America's]{.underline} beleaguered [allies]{.underline} [in the
region]{.underline}.42 To defeat them militarily, China will have to
project power across water, always a dicey proposition, but one made
even harder now if U.S. allies in the region invest in their own A2/AD
technologies.

Finally, and most important, we should keep in mind that [despite the
power transition that is taking place, the United States still wields
considerable **actual and latent power** compared to
China]{.underline}.43 Even if it is challenged in the East Asian region,
[the United States]{.underline} nonetheless [retains]{.underline} what
Barry Posen calls "[the command of the commons" globally]{.underline}.44

Conclusion

In sum, Thucydides' fundamental lessons for the contemporary United
States in its rivalry with China is that democratic Athens erred when it
sought to maintain its primacy by expanding its empire during the
Peloponnesian War; today, **[[we do not need to preserve]{.mark} a
position of [primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** in East Asia [[but
can]{.mark} instead [rest content with a]{.mark} modest and attainable
goal of maintaining a balance of power]{.underline}. Therefore, [the
best]{.underline} grand [strategy]{.underline} for the contemporary
United States I believe, and the Thucydidean approach I know, [favors
the more [restrained]{.mark} balance of power
[approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Grand strategies based upon balance of
power, like restraint or offshore balancing, will prove more feasible
and successful than those based upon some form of power maximization,
such as conservative internationalism, primacy, deep engagement, or
liberal internationalism, for the United States to manage its rivalry
with China in this century without blundering into the "Thucydides
trap." War is a choice.

### Satellite Norms !D

#### Satellite norms can't solve anything\-\--altitude and orbit constraints, decreased lifespans, debris, ground stations, and lack of operators all prove

Why Spherical Keep-Out Zones or [Minimum Safe Distance Won't Work in
Space]{.underline}

Satellite close approaches have become the source of numerous public
complaints and U.N. discussions on space behavior. In February 2020, the
first U.S. Space Force Chief of Space Operations, Gen. John Raymond,
made a public statement that a Russian satellite had been actively
maneuvering in the vicinity of a U.S. government satellite in a way that
appeared to be threatening. China has complained that close passes of
Starlink satellites to their crewed space station posed enough of a
collision risk that the Chinese station had to maneuver out of the way.
Meanwhile, U.S. military leaders have raised concern that China's
claimed debris removal satellite could pose a threat if it was used to
approach or grab on to the satellites of other countries.

Spherical [keep-out zones work]{.underline} best [in environments where
actors are free to approach an object from any direction. This is not
the case for satellites in space]{.underline}. Despite the vastness and
relative emptiness of space, [[satellite]{.mark} [motion in]{.mark}
Earth orbit [is]{.mark} tightly [constrained]{.mark}. Whenever a
satellite makes the slightest change in speed or direction, it must
change either its altitude or its orbit orientation.]{.underline} This
means that, theoretically, [[two]{.mark} [satellites]{.mark} perched [in
the]{.mark} exact [same orbit should never collide even if they
are]{.mark} relatively [close to each]{.mark}
[other]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[a satellite
positioned]{.underline}]{.mark} either [[higher or lower]{.mark} in
altitude]{.underline} than a nearby satellite [[will drift away]{.mark}
from the other [naturally]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a result, large keep-out zones for satellites in the same orbit are
unnecessary because [[physics]{.mark} automatically minimizes the risk
posed in these directions. It]{.underline} also naturally
[[constrains]{.mark} the [behavior of operators planning a threatening
approach.]{.mark}]{.underline} Given these maneuver constraints,
[[waiting for a]{.mark} potentially threatening [satellite to enter
a]{.mark}]{.underline} spherical [[keep-out zone could]{.mark} also
[mean]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} threatened [satellite does not
have]{.mark} enough [time to maneuver away.]{.mark} Yet, expanding the
keep-out sphere to provide more time]{.underline} or warning
[would]{.underline} likely result in a sphere so large that it
[render]{.underline}s [significant parts of an orbit
unusable.]{.underline}

Another major concern with applying the concept of [spherical [keep-out
zones]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it [may [negatively impact]{.mark}
important [space norms and]{.mark} behaviors]{.underline}, especially if
the keep-out spheres are large. For instance, [all [nations]{.mark} who
operate satellites in geostationary orbit [must register]{.mark} with
the International Telecommunication Union [for a
"slot]{.mark},"]{.underline} a roughly 75-kilometer (45-mile)-wide
region [[where they can operate their spacecraft]{.mark}
safely]{.underline} without having their communications link interfered
with[. [A single]{.mark}]{.underline} 700-kilometer-wide [[keep-out zone
would eliminate 10 of these slots]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally,
geostationary satellite operators almost universally dispose their
satellites in a graveyard orbit 300--500 kilometers (180--310 miles)
above geostationary orbit when the useful life of the spacecraft is
nearly over. [Enforcing large keep-out zones would force the graveyard
orbit higher, which will either reduce spacecraft lifespans]{.underline}
due to the need for more propellant to reach the new graveyard [or
incentivize operators to ignore disposal best practices,]{.underline}
all without improving the safety of geostationary spacecraft.

[For low Earth orbit spacecraft]{.underline}, spherical [keep-out zones
make even less sense.]{.underline} Unlike in geostationary orbit, where
most satellites lie in roughly the same orbital plane --- in a ring
aligned with the equator --- [low Earth orbit satellites occupy many
different orbits at varying altitudes and orientations]{.underline}.
Many of these orbits intersect, which may or may not lead to potential
impact points. [Depending on the timing of the conjunction, [a satellite
on the other side of Earth may pose a greater]{.mark} and more immediate
[risk of collision than a satellite]{.mark} just [a couple of miles
away]{.mark}. Applying a single]{.underline} spherical [keep-out
zone]{.underline} to every satellite, especially in the crowded regions
where large low Earth orbit constellations reside, [will lead to either
keep-out zones that are too small to be meaningful or so large as to be
impossible to enforce.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [many potential threats to satellites do not require
physical proximity]{.underline}. Instead, for threats like interference
with or jamming of satellite signals, the object causing interference
only needs to be between the target satellite and the device that
satellite is trying to communicate with. Other [threats]{.underline},
[such as cyber attacks, might target ground stations]{.underline}
instead of satellites and their communications links. So, [norms that
categorize threats solely based on how physically close they are to a
satellite may be more of a placebo]{.underline} than a means of
effectively identifying aggressive behaviors before they go too far.

Finally, spherical [[keep-out zones]{.mark} would [do nothing to
reduce]{.mark} the problem of orbital [debris]{.mark} or
non-maneuverable satellites. For both]{.underline} types of objects,
[there is no operator making the decision to move out of the way if they
enter a keep-out zone]{.underline}. And thanks to the high speeds and
difficulty of maneuvering in orbit, [waiting until a piece of
debris]{.underline} or non-maneuvering satellite [enters a]{.underline}
spherical [keep-out zone could make it too late to avoid a
collision.]{.underline} The infamous 2009 crash between a defunct
Russian Kosmos satellite and an Iridium communications satellite
occurred at a right angle with a relative speed of over 22,000 miles per
hour: [No keep-out sphere or minimum safe distance would have provided
warning in time because the satellites were continents away from each
other minutes earlier.]{.underline} Debris always has the right of way
in space, so the options when on the collision path with a piece of
debris are to move or get hit. Spherical keep-out zones do not add any
information or tools to make that equation easier.

## Indicts of golden dome 

### US---Bad for National Security 

#### The Golden Dome could break down U.S national security

Security, and Foreign Policy, Harvard Kennedy School, 6-6-2025, \"Golden
Dome dangers: An arms control expert explains how Trump's missile
defense threatens to make the US less safe\", Conversation,

//Vfrts

[[Trump's goals for Golden Dome are likely beyond
reach]{.underline}.]{.mark} A wide range of studies makes clear that
[[even defenses far more limited]{.mark} than what Trump envisions
[would be **far more expensive and less effective** than Trump
expects]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially against enemy missiles
equipped with modern countermeasures**. Countermeasures include multiple
warheads per missile, decoy warheads and warheads that can maneuver or
are difficult to track, among others.**]{.underline} Regardless of
Golden Dome's feasibility, there is a long history of scholarship about
strategic missile defenses, and the weight of [[evidence points to the
defenses making their host country less safe from nuclear
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. I'm a national security and foreign policy
professor at Harvard University, where I lead "Managing the Atom," the
university's main research group on nuclear weapons and nuclear energy
policies. For decades, I've been participating in dialogues with Russian
and Chinese nuclear experts -- and their fears about U.S. missile
defenses have been a consistent theme throughout. Russian President
Vladmir [[Putin and]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese leader Xi [[Jinping
have already warned that Golden Dome]{.mark} is destabilizing. Along
with U.S. offensive capabilities, Golden Dome [poses a threat of
"directly undermining global strategic stability, spurring an arms race
and increasing conflict potential ]{.mark}]{.underline}both [[among
nuclear-weapon states]{.mark} and in the international arena as a
whole,"]{.underline} a joint statement from China and Russia said. While
that is a propaganda statement, it reflects real concerns broadly held
in both countries.

#### A Golden Dome prompts countries to believe the U.S is readying for first strike

analyst for National Interest and Justin Logan, director of defense and

//Vfrts

Lastly, [[a missile defense system on this scale increases the
probability of preemptive strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For deterrence
[to be most effective, each side must be made to believe it cannot win a
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [A Golden Dome could give the United States
the false belief that it can strike]{.underline}]{.mark} [an enemy
[first and protect itself from retaliatory
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. At the same time, America's
adversaries would be conscious of America's perception that it can
strike first. They would then be tempted to take two courses of action.
First, to further improve their own missiles, an inexpensive endeavor
compared to the costs of missile defenses. It is easier and cheaper to
make missiles harder to target than it is to effectively target them.
Second, [a Golden Dome would make it more likely that America's
adversaries would launch preemptive strikes against the United States
during a crisis]{.underline}. US policy holds open the prospect of
launching nuclear weapons first. America's adversaries could well view
this first-strike option, coupled with the prospects of an elaborate
missile defense system, as dangerous[. [If the United States can rest
securely behind its Golden Dome, what is to stop the United States from
launching a first-strike]{.underline} ]{.mark}[itself]{.underline}? By
posturing their missiles for preemptive strikes, America's rivals can
work to prevent the United States from escaping the condition of
mutually assured vulnerability. This creates a dangerous situation.
[[One lapse of judgment or misinterpreted action could lead to one side
launching its missiles.]{.underline}]{.mark} There are viable options to
bolster America's deterrence. Protecting the country's second-strike
capabilities and engaging in arms control negotiations with adversaries
are just two. But pursuing a Golden Dome likely won't work, would be
immensely costly and would run new risks. **[[Modeling US missile
defense on Israel's Iron Dome is a mistake.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Golden Dome forces Russia into arms race at a time when the 

**Brown 25** (James D.J. Brown, 5-19-2025, \"What Will the U.S. Golden
Dome Missile Defense Mean for Russia?\", Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace,

Another probable response is a redoubling of Russian interest in nuclear
anti-satellite weapons. The advantage of such weapons is that they could
quickly eliminate a whole constellation of U.S. military satellites. The
downside is that they would cause tremendous collateral damage,
eliminating numerous civilian satellites and causing untold disruption
to life on earth. However, if the choice were between losing a nuclear
war and destroying much of the world's space infrastructure, the Kremlin
would undoubtedly select the latter option. [[Golden Dome
will]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[press Russia into a new arms race,
forcing it to devote]{.mark} yet [more resources to]{.mark} its
[strategic forces]{.mark} at a time when the country can least afford
it. [The Russian defense budget is already overstretched by the war in
Ukraine,]{.mark} and rebuilding Russia's conventional forces will take
years.]{.underline} These vast outlays will require further diversion of
funds from civilian sectors, [[with predictable consequences for the
long-term health of the Russian economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia's
hurry to develop "super weapons" and nuclear weapons for space bring
further dangers. Poseidon and Burevestnik have been much hyped by the
Kremlin, yet they remain in the development stage and the risk of
accidents is high. The nuclear-powered Burevestnik attracts particular
concern and has been labeled "a flying Chernobyl." A failed test in 2019
is reported to have caused the death of five engineers. [[Ultimately,
Golden Dome]{.mark} may never achieve Trump's grandiose ambitions.
However, even if it does not, it [will have serious consequences for
strategic stability and for Russia in particular.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Trump's Golden Dome plan would be costly and ineffective**

**Kimball 25,** Executive Director of the Arms Control Association and
publisher and contributor for *Arms Control Today* (Daryl Kimball, May
31, 2025, "Golden Dome: Doubling Down on a Strategic Blunder", Arms
Control Association,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2025-06/focus/golden-dome-doubling-down-strategic-blunder)

Nuclear and defense strategists have long understood that the developing
and deploying of strategic missile interceptors is ineffective against
determined nuclear-armed adversaries because it could lead them to build
more numerous and sophisticated offensive missile systems---at a
relatively lower cost and more quickly---to overwhelm and evade missile
defenses. Strategic missile defenses can never be effective and reliable
enough to defend the entire United States, but they can still negate a
portion of a potential missile attack and upset strategic stability.
[Unless limited by national policy or mutual agreement, as the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty once did, ambitious [U.S. missile
"shield" proposals]{.mark} can [spur]{.mark} adversaries such as [China
and Russia to enhance their strategic forces to]{.mark} maintain the
ability to [inflict a devastating nuclear retaliatory
strike]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, even after the George W. Bush
administration withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002 to rush deployment
of a limited strategic interceptor program before the next election,
U.S. policymakers have focused mostly on improving capabilities to
address limited attacks from lesser North Korean missile threats rather
than more substantial threats posed by the major nuclear powers.
Upending longstanding U.S. policy and ignoring strategic realities,
[U.S. President Donald [Trump]{.mark} announced May 20 that he [wants to
spend]{.mark} at least \$175 billion of [taxpayer dollars for a]{.mark}
crash strategic missile interceptor [scheme]{.mark} dubbed "Golden Dome"
[to defend the]{.mark} continental [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
against all missile threats, including those from China and Russia,
"within three years."]{.underline} Trump's radical plan is technically
complex, prohibitively expensive, and counterproductive. Golden Dome,
which is still in the conceptual phase, would patch together existing
and possibly new ground- and sea-based interceptors and radars with the
introduction of hundreds, if not thousands, of space-based sensors and
missile interceptors. [The system is [designed to destroy incoming
missiles]{.mark} by destroying them early in flight, targeting them
midcourse, or seeking to hit them just before impact on their
targets.]{.underline} Members of Congress from both parties need to cut
through Trump's hyperbole and demand serious answers to basic questions
about this initiative before writing a blank check to a few big defense
contractors. What specific threat is it designed to defeat? What success
rate is being sought? What is the plan for building the system? How will
adversaries respond? What effect will it have on strategic stability and
space security? Clearly, [Trump's radical strategic missile defense
scheme would be even more costly than advertised. Consider that more
than \$250 billion already has been allocated to Missile Defense Agency
programs since 1985. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated
that a new space-based interceptor program would exceed \$500 billion
over the next 20 years. That program was originally scoped for the North
Korean missile threat of 10 years ago, not today's threat of the peer
and near-peer states that Trump wants to defend against.]{.underline}
Even Sen. Tim Sheehy, (R-Mont.), who announced plans to form a Golden
Dome caucus, said: ["[It will]{.mark} likely [cost]{.mark} in the
[trillions if]{.mark} and when [Golden Dome is
completed]{.mark}."]{.underline} No matter how much money is spent on
exotic crash programs, however, an effective U.S. missile defense system
will not be feasible anytime soon, which means that it will not affect
strategic stability in the near term. As a result, Chinese and Russian
military planners would be smart not to overreact by building up their
strategic offensive nuclear forces. [If Trump's strategic missile
defense plan is eventually implemented, however[, it would destabilize
the]{.mark} already [precarious nuclear balance of terror that exists
among]{.mark} the major [nuclear-armed powers]{.mark}. It would
[heighten the danger that space will become a war zone and push China
and Russia to]{.mark} further improve and [expand their strategic
offensive capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moscow is already
developing new systems---such as an undersea torpedo, a hypersonic glide
vehicle, and a nuclear-powered cruise missile---to ensure it can
overcome any future U.S. missile defenses. It is also developing a
capability for a nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon, which underscores
the vulnerabilities of a space-based interceptor network. Beijing,
meanwhile, has already begun to respond to U.S. missile defense and
conventional long-range strike capabilities by increasing its
nuclear-armed ballistic missile force. These factors make it even more
vital that Russia and the United States engage immediately in strategic
stability talks and negotiations to cap or reduce their massive
strategic nuclear arsenals before the last remaining treaty, the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, expires in 2026. China, too, needs to
back up its complaints about U.S. unilateralism, strategic missile
defense, and space-based interceptors by agreeing to participate in
direct, high-level, strategic risk-reduction talks with the United
States. If Trump, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and Chinese dictator
Xi Jinping continue to bicker in public rather than negotiate mutually
beneficial limits on strategic offensive and defensive weapons, the
world faces a more dangerous future.

**The "Golden Dome" would be unable to defend against attack from
adversaries**

**Moric 25,** Associate Research Scholar at Princeton University (Igor
Moric, June 13, 2025, "Dome of Delusion: The Many Costs of Ballistic
Missile Defense", Arms Control Association,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2025-06/features/dome-delusion-many-costs-ballistic-missile-defense)

Impressed by the effectiveness of the Israeli Iron Dome defense system
against short- to medium-range rockets and drones, U.S. President Donald
Trump issued an executive order January 27 directing ambitious plans for
an \"Iron Dome for America.\" The initiative, since renamed [[Golden
Dome]{.mark}, maintains the goal of defending the United States against
ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missiles from peer,
near-peer, and rogue adversaries.]{.underline} In an announcement May
20, Trump stated that \$25 billion had been allocated initially in the
defense budget to begin constructing a missile defense architecture
comprising land-, sea-, and space-based interceptors and sensors,
\"forever ending\" the missile threat to the homeland by the end of his
term. [Although Trump was correct to warn recently about the destructive
capability of nuclear weapons, the need to reduce nuclear arsenals, and
the massive budgets being spent on them,1 [pursuing the fantasy of
national missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline} will accomplish the
opposite; it [[will incentivize China and Russia to]{.mark} double down
on [build]{.mark}ing [up their nuclear arsenals]{.mark},]{.underline} it
will [[cost the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[hundreds of billions]{.mark} of dollars,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} it will [[not work]{.mark} as
intended]{.underline}. An invincible shield that can safeguard the
United States from nuclear war just as a \"roof protects a family from
rain\" is a captivating idea that survives despite many past failures.2
[Use of metaphors such as shields or domes]{.underline} made of iron or
gold, or bullets hitting bullets, combined with a lack of publicly
available information and a limited general understanding on how missile
defense works, perpetuate the illusion that with enough time and money,
technology will advance to eventually enable protection against all
external threats. Over the years, this [has spurred over-ambitious
attempts at building missile defense systems, with the momentum
collapsing once limitations become apparent and policymakers recognize
that [even attempting to establish such a capability adds an element of
strategic instability because of increasing pressures for the other side
to deploy additional missiles to counter it]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
1983, U.S. President Ronald Reagan addressed the nation, asking whether
people wanted to continue relying on the threat of instant U.S.
retaliation to deter a Soviet attack. Troubled by the moral implications
of mutually assured destruction and the vulnerability of strategic
ballistic missiles, and driven by the technological optimism of his
science advisers, Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI). This effort aimed to stabilize the relationship between offensive
and defensive nuclear arms and ultimately free the world from the threat
of nuclear weapons by rendering them impotent and obsolete. Due to its
futuristic vision of missile defense, the program was derisively
nicknamed \"Star Wars.\" It included ambitious concepts such as
space-based lasers and particle-beam weapons, and a network of ground-
and space-based interceptor systems. Contrary to Trump\'s claim in the
executive order, SDI was not prematurely cancelled. It was an obstacle
to arms control, encouraged the buildup of Soviet offensive nuclear
capabilities, and ultimately could not meet its technical requirements
even in a scaled-down version. The system could be evaded and
penetrated, and the cost dynamics favored the attacker, who had a major
advantage by being able to \"overwhelm\" the interceptors with I
relatively cheaper warheads or \"outfox\" them with decoys.3 Star Wars:
A New Hope After the September 11 attacks, concerns over missile threats
from terrorist and rogue states gained political momentum in the United
States. This provided the Bush administration with an opportunity to
withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, removing all
restraints on development of missile defense systems[. Over the past two
decades at a price of more than \$200 billion, the incremental
deployment of building blocks of national ballistic missile defense has
continued unchecked, driven by steady technological creep, bureaucratic
inertia and policy neglect, without much reflection on the cost or its
strategic implications.4 Although not formally designated as such, the
U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), already has been constructing its own
version of the dome, even \| before Trump\'s executive
order.]{.underline} Without specifying the origin or the extent of the
threat, the MDA plans envision a layered network to \"defend the United
States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from missile attacks in
all phases of flight.\" The first Trump administration\'s 2019 Missile
Defense Review maintained that the focus of U.S. missile defense was
against \"rogue states,\" but the systems MDA has been developing are
increasingly capable of degrading Russian and Chinese second-strike
capabilities, causing concern in Moscow and Beijing. The recent order
simply codified longstanding ambitions to reconfigure U.S. ballistic
missile defense architecture to defend against large-scale attacks,
enforcing Trump\'s past public statements that the goal of missile
defense is to \"detect and destroy any missile launched against the
United States, anytime, anywhere, and anyplace.\"5 As with the proposed
Golden Dome, MDA\'s planned architecture is to include a few types of
interceptors, supported by a combination of ground- and sea-based
radars, hundreds of infrared sensors to detect launches, and
communication satellites to distribute data to interceptors. In
cooperation with the Space Development Agency, the roadmap calls for a
continuously replenished satellite constellation, including a
\"birth-to-death\" tracking and fire control sensor developed in the
Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor program and referenced in
the recent EO. Although ballistic missile defense systems have been a
longtime interest of the United States and Trump, the release of the
executive order was likely influenced by recent events. [In the April
and October 2024 attacks on Israel, most of the launched Iranian
ballistic missiles-about half of which failed at launch or in
flight-were intercepted by defense systems operated by
Israel]{.underline} and its allies. These systems, as well as Patriot
interceptors operated by Ukraine in defense against the Russian
invasion, demonstrated effectiveness at guarding sites against slower
threats traveling in the atmosphere, including drones and medium- and
short-range ballistic missiles. Such successes by theater missile
defense systems are widely publicized, creating an inaccurate public
perception about missile defense in general. [Replicating the same
performance on a national scale is a very different problem.6 [The
Israeli Iron Dome effectively defends an area the size of New Jersey;
intercepting faster and higher flying nuclear]{.mark} armed long-range
[ballistic missiles over a country 450 times larger is far more
complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once incoming reentry vehicles traveling
at hypersonic speeds enter the atmosphere at an altitude of around 100
kilometers, [[U.S. terminal phase interceptor
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
and Patriot [[have only a few minutes to reach the intercept point,
limiting the area they can realistically defend]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The most efficient way to defend a wide area is to destroy ballistic
missiles in their boost phase, within 3-5 minutes after launch, while
their engines are still firing and before reentry vehicles have been
separated from the missile payload. During this phase, the missile\'s
bright exhaust makes it easier to detect the launch from space. Due to
geographical realities and time constraints, however, U.S. land and
sea-based interceptor systems cannot be positioned close enough to
engage launches from deep within Russian or Chinese territory in a
timely fashion. Enter space-based interceptors, a capability referenced
in the order and previously explored in SDL This would involve a
mega-constellation of orbiting satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO)
carrying interceptor missiles and potentially other non-kinetic weapons
such as lasers. Because LEO satellites are constantly orbiting Earth at
high velocities, many would be needed to provide coverage over any
specific region. For example, [to cover a single launch of the North
Korean Hwasong-18]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missile
[(ICBM) and defend most locations in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates (excluding Alaska), it is estimated that the United
States [would require at least 1,600 orbiting
interceptors]{.underline}.7 [Defending against missiles launched from
China or Russia would demand many more, while also somehow avoiding
reaction over the orbital placement of tens of thousands of weapons
overflying their territory]{.underline}. Attempting to construct a
constellation capable of protecting against attacks by peer adversaries
would be prohibitively costly even accounting for the falling costs of
space-launches.8 Additionally as satellite orbits decay over time,
orbiting interceptors would need to be continuously replenished. A
single layer would not provide reliable protection, because the attacker
could target the vulnerable satellites with relatively cheap missiles or
maneuverable satellites, punching a hole through which long-range
missiles could pass. China and Russia already possess such advanced
anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities. They also could detonate a nuclear
explosion in orbit, blinding sensors detecting launches and tracking
missiles, and polluting the interceptor orbit with debris. Therefore, to
ensure effectiveness of the shield, the United States would have to
deploy multiple layers of interceptors in different orbits and a fleet
of maneuverable satellites to defend them, multiplying the overall cost
of the system and rendering the whole concept absurd. Realistically,
MDA\'s near-term focus likely will remain building a patchwork of their
existing interceptor systems, while continuing to expand space-based
sensor and communication layers. Most of the agency\'s efforts focus on
intercepting ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric midcourse
phase, in which missiles travel unpowered through space for 20 to 30
minutes and reentry vehicles are released from the payload. MDA\'s
midcourse defense systems include the legacy Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense (GMD), which consists of 44 \"hit-to-kill\" interceptors
stationed in Alaska and California, the developing Next-Generation
Interceptor (NGI) system with 64 interceptors that is to replace GMD,
and the land- and ship-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system,
which uses shorter-range SM-3 IIA missiles with kinetic, non-explosive
warheads. Scripted tests performed under \"controlled conditions\"
demonstrate that GMD interceptors have a single-hit kill effectiveness
of just 56 percent, with all successful interceptions against ICBMs
occurring during daytime. Aegis interceptors have only been tested
successfully once against a short-range ICBM, also under optimal
conditions where the launch times and the trajectory for the target
missile were known in advance. Because they were never tested in
realistic conditions, the real-world reliability of GMD and Aegis
systems against sophisticated threats remains unknown. For example, none
of the tests accounted for the possibility of jamming the interceptors
or considered cyber or kinetic vulnerabilities of the defense. The
target missiles were not allowed attempts to evade interception or carry
more than one warhead. In practice, attacking ICBMs would carry multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles, each able to target a
different location within some area. The missiles also could be launched
with unexpected trajectories or from submarines near the U.S. coast,
further limiting the system\'s effectiveness. In addition, as reentry
vehicles containing warheads are released from the missile payload, the
attacker would employ countermeasures designed to make interception more
difficult. For example, some warheads could be replaced with cheap,
lightweight decoys that can simulate the radar signature and trajectory
of warheads. In LEO there is not much air resistance, and warheads and
decoys move virtually the same, making discrimination challenging. The
defender needs to identify decoys and ignore, or waste interceptors to
destroy them.9 Given that there are many imaginative ways to confuse the
defender, and the defender may only learn about the method used at the
moment of the attack, the United States may end up launching some of its
half-billion-dollar interceptors at chaff wires, decoys mimicking the
signature of reentry vehicles, balloons, or bomblets, quickly exhausting
the limited supply of interceptors without fully eliminating the
threat.10 The Many Costs of the Golden Dome In 1985, [Reagan\'s arms
control adviser]{.underline}, Paul Nitze, [outlined three criteria that
a missile defense system must meet to be successful: It must work, it
must be survivable, and it must remain cost effective at the
margin]{.underline}. Most [analyses of]{.underline} ballistic missile
defense ([BMD]{.underline}) focus on the first two requirements and
examine the technological feasibility of the proposed systems. The 2011
report by the Federation of American Scientists, the 2012 report by the
National Academy of Sciences, the 2016 report by the Union of Concerned
Scientists, and the recently released report by the American Physical
Society [all indicate that]{.underline} at the moment, [U.S. [BMD
systems have near zero capability against a large-scale Chinese or
Russian nuclear attack, and only a very limited capability against a
smaller-scale North Korean attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 Shielded from
public oversight, however, the U.S. government appears to have decided
that the nearly half-trillion dollars spent so far on ballistic missile
defense, and the \$200 billion that was projected to be spent in
2020-2029, are not enough and that this time is different.12 Despite
decades of failures, the U.S. national BMD system, with enough funding
and effort, may yet evolve into a reliable shield against nuclear
ballistic missile attacks. In a recent analysis,13 we therefore forwent
questioning MDA\'s techno-optimistic claims, and imagined that the
technology required for ballistic missile defense with 90 percent
overall system effectiveness had been reached, matching the goal of the
GMD and mirroring the claimed effectiveness of the Israeli Iron Dome, in
spite of vastly more demanding requirements.14 It also was assumed that
the systems could not be easily jammed or destroyed by an adversary and
rather than asking how, we asked how much? By accepting that all things
work as advertised and focusing on missile defense costs, this analysis
derived how many dollars the United States would need to spend to deploy
land and ship-based defenses for each dollar China or Russia spend to
field a major scale nuclear attack with their land-based ballistic
missiles. First, based on archival data and by adjusting for inflation
and purchasing power, the cost of a hypothetical ICBM with adequate
range to strike the United States from China or Russia was estimated at
\$42 million, including missile maintenance and construction of a silo
launch facility. The analysis assumed that the attacker could deliver
between 500 and 6,000 warheads, reflecting estimates of China\'s
expanding arsenal and Russia\'s deployed and retired but not yet
dismantled weapons. Next, the analysis estimated the costs of
establishing and maintaining a U.S. BMD system built around the planned
ground-based NGIs and ship-based Aegis interceptors. The assumed unit
cost for the NGI interceptor was about \$487 million, based on a report
released by the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office.15 For the
Aegis ship interceptors, the approximate cost was \$60 million per unit,
including the SM-3 Block IIA missile, and its maintenance, and
accounting for the cost of critical subsystems of the Aegis Combat
System: the VLS-41 launcher and AN/SPY-6 radar. Finally, a scenario was
modeled where the United States established a two-layered defense, made
possible by geographically distributing Aegis ships near trajectories of
Chinese or Russian missiles. By considering the size of the defense and
the attack, in a two-layered defense the defender can minimize the
number of interceptors by being able to shoot, look to see how many
threats have been destroyed, and shoot again. The BMD system was
assigned an overall effectiveness of 90 percent, while individual
interceptor kill-effectiveness was set at either 50 percent (a more
realistic, but still highly optimistic case) or 90 percent (a wildly
optimistic case, but targeted efficiency). The results show that in an
ideal case for the defender, where interceptors reach 90 percent kill
effectiveness and the system can perfectly reject all countermeasures,
[the United States [needs to spend]{.mark} on average [8 times more to
defend itself than the attacker needs to spend to build, equip, and
launch its missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline} This scenario assumes that
each attacking ICBM carries five warheads, it excludes the cost of the
defender\'s sensors and ignores past and future projected missile
defense technology development expenditures. [Recognizing that [U.S.
missile defense systems have not]{.mark} yet [been proven to have any
capability to discriminate decoys or identify
countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline}, we accounted for this in a more
realistic scenario by assuming the attacker\'s ICBMs carry two decoys
per warhead, or 15 targets per missile. Because it is speculated that
the attacker could pack many more decoys in the payload and use other
countermeasures, [this is still a highly optimistic case.]{.underline}
With interceptor kill effectiveness set at the demonstrated 50 percent,
while still ignoring the costs of development and external sensors, the
United States needs to spend an average 70 times more than the attacker,
making defense economically difficult to sustain. These findings show
that even if technical challenges could be overcome and the efficiency
of U.S. national ballistic missile defense against faster long-range
ballistic missiles matched the efficiency of the Israeli Iron Dome
against shorter-range Iranian missiles and drones, the cost-exchange
dynamics still heavily favor the attacker. By extension, if the United
States builds an expensive missile defense system that may never
function as imagined, its [[adversaries have every incentive to respond
by building nuclear weapons]{.mark} and delivery vehicles that can
overwhelm the defense at a much lower relative cost.]{.underline} The
United States may be able to operate with such an economic disadvantage
against North Korea, but unless nuclear weapon arsenals are reduced
dramatically a successful nuclear offense-defense race against China or
Russia is unlikely to become feasible. As technology improves and
production is expanded, the cost of U.S. interceptors could decrease and
match the cost of an attacker\'s ballistic missiles relying on legacy
1960 technology. Yet, to detect missile launches, track reentry
vehicles, and guide interceptors, the defender still requires a costly
network of radars and space-based sensors. That the cost-exchange
dynamics favor offense was recognized by U.S. military planners since
the beginning of missile defense programs. Relatively cheap
countermeasures can nullify the effectiveness of any BMD system and, as
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara argued in 1962, \"[[no amount of money
could make possible an absolute defense against
ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Unfortunately, decisionmaking on U.S.
ballistic defense is often steered by political motivations and economic
interests of the military-industrial complex, making it difficult to
constrain the development drives by cost or strategic considerations.
With not much to show for it, by the end of the decade, the combined
U.S. expenditures on ballistic missile defense since the late 1950s
could reach many times more than the cost of the Manhattan Project, a
few times more than landing the first men on the Moon, and double what
is estimated to land humans on Mars. Trump gave the Pentagon only 60
days to propose an architecture for the Golden Dome, but it took
military contractors even less time to overpromise on something on which
they ultimately will underdeliver. For example, Lockheed Martin called
for a \"Manhattan Project-scale\" effort to deliver the first Golden
Dome within a year. L3Harris praised Trump\'s bold vision for Golden
Dome, urging a dramatic acceleration to adopt commercial products to a
\"catastrophic threat.\" SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, who also heads
administration cost-cutting efforts, reportedly has teamed up with
defense startups Anduril and Palantir to compete for the Golden Dome
contract.16 Reason for the Need When announcing SDI, Reagan called on
the scientific community to develop BMD as a safer, morally preferable
alternative to relying on nuclear deterrence based on mutual
destruction. In 2019, Trump called for a program that can shield every
U.S. city, and has since warned that there is no greater danger than the
menace of nuclear weapons, signaling the need to strengthen U.S.
security without relying on the threat of nuclear retaliation.17 Yet, as
long as nuclear weapons exist, fully eliminating the danger of nuclear
war is not a plausible choice. Even if Golden Dome is fully assembled
and achieves 90 percent interception rate, 10 percent of incoming
warheads would still get through. [In the event of a major-scale attack,
at least 60 Chinese and 150 Russian warheads would still strike targets
in the United States. The resulting fallout would inflict catastrophic
damage across the country and trigger a U.S. nuclear response,
regardless of the adversary\'s targeting plans]{.underline}. Although
there is no evidence a conflict between nuclear-weapon states would just
fizzle out, there are plenty of indicators to suggest otherwise. These
include the recently declassified 1983 \"Proud Prophet\" wargame, which
demonstrated how a limited nuclear war in Europe likely would escalate
rapidly and catastrophically. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of
U.S. Strategic Command, described their nuclear wargaming exercises in
2017: \"They end the same way every time. They end badly, with global
nuclear war.\" Finally, Trump himself warned that any nuclear weapon use
would mean \"probably oblivion.\"18 [[National ballistic missile defense
is technologically unfeasible, prohibitively costly, and bad for
deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although it may be efficient in
\"mopping-up\" missiles from an adversary\'s limited retaliatory nuclear
strike (in the unlikely case a hypothetical U.S. nuclear first strike
manages to take out most of the other capabilities), this scenario also
presumes that adversaries would passively observe the massive
undertaking required to establish an effective national BMD system. A
defense with 90 percent effectiveness would allow only 10 out of 100
warheads to go through, but a strike consisting of 1,000 warheads would
leak 100. While in a static case a missile defense system could enhance
deterrence by reducing the adversary\'s confidence that an attack will
be successful, if it is not perfect, it also creates incentives for a
nuclear arms race. Unless constrained by resources, [adversaries will
attempt to regain lost confidence by increasing the size of their
nuclear arsenals or by modernizing to improve delivery vehicles. In
addition to building up its nuclear stockpile and adding hundreds of new
ICBM silos, [China has tested systems specifically aimed at evading
missile defense]{.mark}, including by reviving the idea of placing
nuclear weapons in fractional orbit. Meanwhile, [Russia is modernizing
its ICBMs and developing \"exotic\" nuclear systems to bypass missile
defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline}19 Russia is also testing concepts for
nuclear anti-satellite weapons, and has recently warned that any
attempts to deploy U.S. space-based interceptors would further fuel the
militarization of space.20 Although U.S. missile defense efforts are not
the only reason, they provide a pretext for Chinese and Russian military
expansion and refusal to discuss nuclear disarmament and arms control.
[U.S. ballistic missile defense also is not deterring North Korea\'s
nuclear buildup, with Pyongyang rapidly closing its technological gap
with U.S. peer competitors.]{.underline} Justified by pseudo-rational
military purposes and guarded from accountability by the protection of
national security, the ideas of national ballistic missile defense
periodically resurface to defend the United States against threats of
its own making, driven by promises of impending technological
breakthroughs and a sunk cost fallacy. As with SDI, public perception
and political commitments to the idea of what Golden Dome should be are
conflicting with what it can be-limited by cost, physical and
technological realities constraining its effectiveness, and strategic
implications of its deployment. Before deciding to pursue national
ballistic missile defense, Trump\'s administration should consider: Will
the deployment of Golden Dome truly enhance U.S. national security
interests, or will it increase the risks of nuclear escalation and fuel
arms racing? Can such a system, with all its limitations, deter a
Russian or Chinese attack? Should deterrence fail, can it meaningfully
limit the consequences of nuclear war? The United States also should
further examine the technological feasibility of national ballistic
missile defense before committing billions to building it. This is not a
political question or one for deterrence theoreticians but for
scientists and engineers. To start, Trump should direct MDA to set clear
system requirements and conduct independently reviewed tests under
real-world conditions, without limiting the types of techniques used to
obtain favorable results. In 2010, the JASON independent advisory group
of experts produced a report on discrimination techniques for U.S.
midcourse missile defense. JASON could be called upon again, given
access to required classified data, and tasked with evaluating the
credibility of planned interceptor and sensor architecture against
Russian and Chinese ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and
their delivery vehicles. Alternatively, if Trump is serious about
reducing unnecessary military spending, he could leverage administration
experts with significant technical knowledge and without conflicts of
interest, tasking them to evaluate the program objectively and ensure
that its continuation aligns with goals of government efficiency and
effective resource allocation.

[President [Trump and his administration are advancing plans for]{.mark}
their version of [a homeland missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden
Dome]{.mark}." Proponents of the Golden Dome]{.underline}, such as Air
Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin, [claim]{.underline} that it
is required to protect the US homeland. Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth praised the project, arguing it is "a generational investment in
the security of America and Americans," and that [the Golden Dome would
be capable of intercepting "cruise missiles, ballistic missiles,
hypersonic missiles, drones, whether they're conventional or nuclear."
While this all sounds good, there are reasons to worry about the genesis
of the idea, its cost, its feasibility and its risks. President Trump
announced the initiative in an executive order in January titled "Iron
Dome for America," [a reference to Israel's Iron Dome
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} As that executive order put it, [one of the
goals is to "deter -- and defend its citizens and critical
infrastructure against -- any foreign aerial attack on the
Homeland."]{.underline} Even senior Department of Defense officials
acknowledged that this is an "ambitious undertaking." [The
[Trump]{.mark} administration [should reconsider]{.mark} creating the
Golden Dome. Not only would [such a]{.mark} missile defense
[system]{.mark} be [costly and unlikely to pull off, but]{.mark} it
[would also run new risks.]{.mark} The first problem is that the project
appears to be based on the idea that the United States can replicate the
successes of Israel's Iron Dome system.]{.underline} The analogy is a
bad one. First, the United States' territory is vast, whereas Israel's
is tiny[. While [Israel has to worry about shooting down missiles over
its 8,500 square miles]{.mark}, the United States would need to defend
all nearly 3.8 million square miles of its territory. Since each Iron
Dome system defends roughly 150 square miles, [the U]{.mark}nited
[States would need at least tens of thousands of similar systems]{.mark}
to have a chance of defending most of America's territory.]{.underline}
The basic question of scale makes Trump's claim of the \$175 billion
price tag for the Golden Dome highly dubious. Even if somehow the Trump
administration could field such a massive system so cheaply, a second
problem remains: [ballistic missiles are [much more difficult to
intercept than the short-range missiles]{.mark} and rockets that
[Israel's Iron Dome was built to counter]{.mark}. The missiles Golden
Dome would be aiming at, namely intercontinental ballistic missiles
launched by peer adversaries, travel hundreds of times faster than those
targeted by Israel's system.]{.underline} To make matters worse, a large
number of high-end ballistic missiles have up to 16 warheads on them.
Moreover, militaries also attach decoy warheads atop these ballistic
missiles to evade missile defenses. Even Israel's recent experience
defending itself with [**[Iron
Dome]{.underline}**](https://thespectator.com/topic/inside-israel-iron-dome-hamas-gaza/)
from a fusillade of missiles and drones launched by Iran came to
disappoint. Despite the fact that Iran's missiles are much easier to
intercept than those that would be launched at the United States by
Russia or China, some of them still got through. [What makes the Trump
administration think that a system modeled on Iron Dome could stop a
much larger launch of much more highly advanced missiles -- potentially
armed with nuclear warheads -- from a country like Russia or
China?]{.underline} [Lastly, [a missile defense system on this scale
increases the probability of preemptive strikes]{.mark}. For deterrence
to be most effective, each side must be made to believe it cannot win a
war. A Golden Dome could give the United States the false belief that it
can strike an enemy first and protect itself from retaliatory
strikes]{.underline}. At the same time, [America's adversaries would be
conscious of America's perception that it can strike first.]{.underline}
They would then be tempted to take two courses of action[. First, to
further improve their own missiles, an inexpensive endeavor compared to
the costs of missile defenses. It is easier and cheaper to make missiles
harder to target than it is to effectively target them. Second, a Golden
Dome would make it more likely that America's adversaries would launch
preemptive strikes against the United States during a
crisis.]{.underline} US policy holds open the prospect of launching
nuclear weapons first. America's adversaries could well view this
first-strike option, coupled with the prospects of an elaborate missile
defense system, as dangerous. If the United States can rest securely
behind its Golden Dome, what is to stop the United States from launching
a first-strike itself[? By posturing their missiles for preemptive
strikes, America's [rivals]{.mark} can [work to prevent the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from escaping the condition of mutually
assured vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline} This creates a dangerous
situation. One lapse of judgment or misinterpreted action could lead to
one side launching its missiles. There are viable options to bolster
America's deterrence. Protecting the country's second-strike
capabilities and engaging in arms control negotiations with adversaries
are just two. But pursuing a Golden Dome likely won't work, would be
immensely costly and would run new risks[. Modeling US missile defense
on Israel's Iron Dome is a mistake.]{.underline}

### US---Cost

#### The Cost -- Exchange ratio of the Golden Dome is mediocre to say the least

[[The sheer scale of any defence shield to protect such a vast swathe of
land would be]{.mark}, not merely from a practical point but a budgetary
one, [absurd.]{.mark}]{.underline} A space-based interceptor system, a
point that echoes Reagan\'s Star Wars fantasy, would require thousands
of units to successfully intercept one hefty ballistic missile. Todd
Harrison of the American Enterprise Institute has offered a calculation:
[[a system of 1,900 satellites would cost]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhere
[[between \$11 and \$27 billion to develop]{.mark},]{.underline} build,
and launch. A study for Defence and Peace Economics published this year
goes further. The authors argue that, [[even if the U.S. had
appropriate]{.mark} [b]{.mark}]{.underline}allistic
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}issile [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}efence
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology and a sufficient number of
interceptors [[to be distributed in]{.mark} a [two-layer defence with an
efficiency return of 90%,]{.mark} **[8 times more would have to be spent
than the attacker]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a bill between \$60 billion
and \$500 billion. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} it was assumed [that
[individual interceptor effectiveness was a mere 50%,]{.mark} and the
system could not discriminate against decoys,]{.underline} [[the cost
would be 70 times more, with a staggering bill of \$430 billion to \$5.3
trillion]{.mark}.]{.underline} The most telling flaw in Golden Dome is
one long identified, certainly by the more sober members of the
establishment, in the annals of defence. \"The fundamental problem with
any plan for a national missile defense system against nuclear attack,\"
writes Xiaodon Liang in an Arms Control Association issues brief, \"[is
that [cost-exchange ratios favor the offense and U.S. adversaries can
always choose to build]{.mark}]{.underline} up or diversify [[their
strategic forces to overwhelm a potential shield]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"
As Liang goes on to remark, the missile shield fantasy defies a cardinal
rule of strategic competition: \"**[[the enemy always gets a
vote.]{.underline}\"]{.mark} [Monster system; monstrous integration
issues]{.underline}**. Confusion with the name and trademark problems.
[Strategically misguided, even foolish. **Golden Dome**,]{.underline} it
would seem[, **is already being steadied for a swallow

[**effort** to build the so-called [Golden Dome]{.mark},]{.underline}
according to U.S. officials and experts, with Ottawa providing radars
and airspace needed to track incoming missiles in the Arctic. [[And
while Trump insists the country wants to participate, **Canadian leaders
appear**]{.mark} **more [tepid]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "There's a lot we
just don't know," said Shuvaloy Majumdar, a Conservative member of
Canada's parliament. "There's a lot that needs to be revealed about how
the economic and security partnership with America and Canada will
unfold." [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, in his Golden Dome announcement
on Tuesday, [dismissed what Canada could offer the project.]{.underline}
"They want to have protection also, so as usual, we help Canada," he
said. Yet [whether he realizes it or not]{.underline}, [Trump
**[suddenly finds himself in need of an ally he has]{.mark} largely
[forsaken]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[He has singled out Canada for free
riding on American military might]{.mark} and preferential trade ties,
[and has engaged in a tariff battle that]{.mark} has [stilted
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prime Minister Mark Carney has warned
the United States can't take Ottawa for granted and has begun searching
for other security partners. The shield, therefore, gives Canada some
new leverage in the countries' tenuous relationship. "[None of \[the
Golden Dome partnership\] has been spelled out or
negotiated]{.underline}," Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. "[The
president, because of his rhetoric, has alienated a large part of the
Canadian population]{.underline}, and that's being reflected in the
political leaders ... it's not, you know, good old Canada-USA. It's
like, 'We can't do this easily, because our people are very upset.'"
**[Canada has nearly 4 million square miles of territory.]{.underline}**
[That airspace offers a crucial line of sight for U.S. sensors to shoot
down missiles that Beijing and Moscow are developing to fly over the
North Pole --- **a huge gap in American air defenses.**]{.underline}
"What Canada really brings is terrain," said Glen VanHerck, a retired
Air Force general who led the U.S. Northern Command until last year. "If
we can position, or Canada positions, over-the-horizon radars further
north in the Arctic, that dramatically increases the United States and
Canada's ability to see over the pole into Russia, into China and other
places." Canada has always played a big role in air and missile defense
for North America. The 67 year-old North American Aerospace Defense
Command, or NORAD, has ensured American and Canadian militaries work
together daily to track anything that comes close to either country's
airspace. Canadian and American radars share information, and fighter
planes from both countries patrol the Arctic. They warn away a steady
procession of Russian fighter planes and bombers. [[Ottawa has
historically funded about 40 percent of NORAD
investments]{.mark},]{.underline} according to VanHerck[, and is putting
\$38 billion into the command to add new radars in the north over the
next two decades. [Without those investments]{.mark} --- and additional
sensors that can peer over the North Pole --- [officials believe the
U.S. will have trouble putting together a]{.mark} credible [North
American air defense.]{.mark}]{.underline} "It will be very important
where Canada decides to put its over-the-horizon radar," said a Senate
GOP aide, who was granted anonymity to talk about closed-door policy
talks. "It would be much more difficult without Canada." Ottawa, in
order to help build a Golden Dome, would need to outfit its territory
with more radars and interceptors, such as those already dotted across
California and Alaska. It also would likely have to take a more active
role in commanding air defenses. "What we really want them to do is to
contribute to the production of those assets and to be willing to host
them, if necessary, within Canadian territory," said Tory Bruno, the
president and CEO of United Launch Alliance, the U.S. rocket company
responsible for many of the American government's national security
launches. The U.S. could also beef up a defense shield with radars
Ottawa is already producing. Canada, during Carney's first week in
office, signed a landmark \$4 billion pact with Australia in March for a
long-range radar built by British-based BAE systems. Canada plans to put
these radars in the Arctic and use them as part of NORAD. Carney and his
ministers "are having wide-ranging and constructive discussions with
their American counterparts," Audrey Champoux, a spokesperson from the
prime minister's office, said in a statement. The U.S Northern Command,
which oversees NORAD, said it "will continue to prioritize our core
mission of defending the United States and Canada and will ensure any
new capabilities align with that objective." Some of Trump's supporters
disputed the influence Canada would carry in building the president's
defense shield. "Would it be helpful?" said Sen. Dan Sullivan, the
Alaska Republican who is sponsoring legislation to implement Golden
Dome. "Probably, but it's not vital or existential." [Funding is also an
issue. The White House has requested an initial]{.underline} [Golden
Dome
investment](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/20/trump-golden-dome-price-tag-00360876)
[of \$25 billion in the tax and spending megabill moving through
Congress]{.underline}. But [**Canada's parliament won't have a budget
ready until the fall**. Ottawa is also debating whether to participate
in the shooting down of ballistic missiles, which is a controversial
issue in the Canadian government]{.underline}. Carney has framed any
investment in Golden Dome as a back-and-forth, not a guarantee. "It's
something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed
at a high level," he said Wednesday in Ottawa . "But not --- sure, one
negotiates on this."

posted on social media on Tuesday that if Canada becomes the "cherished

defense system. Ambassador Bob Rae took exception to Trump's comments in
two social media posts, comparting it to something organized crime does.
"**[In another context, this would (be) called a 'protection

both Canada and the U.S. signed the U.N. charter in 1945 that states:
"The Organization is based on the sovereign equality of all nations."
"Threats to sovereign integrity also prohibited," Rae noted. In his
post, Trump said: "[It will cost \$61 Billion Dollars if they remain a

### Canada - Shouldn't Do

#### Canada shouldn't join the Golden Dome -- 3 reasons

**Latham 25** ( Andrew Latham, professor of International Relations at
Macalester College specializing in the politics of international
conflict and security, \"Canada Has A Big F-35 Fighter Problem. But
Golden Dome Is Far Worse\", 05/25/2025, https://www.facebook,

//Vfrts

For
[Canada](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/forget-trumps-threats-canada-needs-the-f-35-stealth-fighter/),
[[joining the Golden Dome carries **three major risks**.]{.underline}
[First, it will siphon]{.underline}]{.mark} [money and [attention from
capabilities we]{.mark} actually [need]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Canada
already struggles to meet]{.mark} its]{.underline}
[[NATO]{.mark}](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-ukraine-war-could-become-a-nato-russia-war/)
[commitment of [spending]{.mark}]{.underline} 2 percent of GDP on
defense -- a target it has failed to hit [for decades.]{.underline} [Its
procurement system is broken, [its military is overstretched]{.mark},
and its northern defenses are anemic.]{.underline} So where exactly will
the billions for the Golden Dome come from? And what will we sacrifice
to pay for it? Submarines? F-35 sustainment? Arctic infrastructure? As
I've
[argued](https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/11/14/its-time-for-canada-to-embrace-its-true-identity-as-a-north-pacific-arctic-and-north-atlantic-power/441534/)
in the past, Canada needs to prioritize platforms and postures that
reinforce its credibility in its own neighborhood, not moonshots that
belong in a brochure. [[Second, the Golden Dome risks enmeshing
Canada]{.mark} even [deeper in]{.mark} the pathologies of [U.S. domestic
politics]{.mark}. Trump's [missile defense]{.mark} obsession [is not
strategic -- **it's performative**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It plays well
with his base, offers a veneer of strength, and [feeds the fantasy that
the U.S. can unilaterally escape the logic of mutual
vulnerability.]{.underline} But it's a fantasy that risks dragging its
partners into a false sense of security. If
[Canada](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/tag/canada/) joins this
system, we effectively tie ourselves to the political fate of Trump's
national security agenda, which could implode -- or mutate -- depending
on who wins in 2028. [[Third]{.mark}, the Golden Dome may actually make
North America less secure by [accelerating arms races]{.mark}. [Missile
defense systems]{.mark} -- even imperfect ones -- [tend **to**
]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[provoke](https://thebulletin.org/2010/05/the-myth-of-missile-defense-as-a-deterrent/)
[rather than deter.]{.underline}]{.mark}** China and Russia will respond
not by accepting the new status quo, but by building more missiles,
deploying decoys, and investing in technologies that render the dome
obsolete before it's operational. This is the classic offense-defense
spiral, well known to students of Clausewitz and Thucydides alike. [What
begins as a defensive measure becomes a destabilizing provocation,
[**leading not to security but to its opposite**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### SpaceX/Musk v Trump

#### Trump and Elon Musk's split has left the future of the Golden Dome in limbo -- SpaceX is key to project

**Turse 25** (Nick Turse, a national security fellow for The Intercept,
reporting on national security and foreign policy, 5-20-2025, \"Trump
Threatened to Cut Musk's Contracts. Golden Dome Deserves Worse.\",
Intercept,
<https://theintercept.com/2025/06/09/trump-musk-golden-dome-missile-spacex/>)
//Vfrts

Musk and his businesses have received at least \$38 billion in
government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits over the past two
decades, according to a recent Washington Post investigation, and most
of that government money has gone to SpaceX. [Musk's companies have 52
ongoing deals with seven government agencies, including the Defense
Department.]{.underline} Nearly two-thirds of that \$38 billion in
government business has come about in the last five years. [[SpaceX had
emerged as a frontrunner to win crucial parts of the Golden Dome
project,]{.mark}]{.underline} which aims to build a network of
satellites to detect and track missiles streaking toward the United
States. [[SpaceX currently has,]{.mark}]{.underline} according to many
observers[, [a near-monopoly on the U.S. satellite launch
market]{.underline}]{.mark}, and builds both the rockets to carry
military payloads into space and satellites that can provide
surveillance and targeting technology. The firm is already the top
Pentagon supplier of launch services and low-Earth-orbit communications
systems. [[NASA relies on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to service the
International Space Station]{.underline}.]{.mark} The space agency was
also expected to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon
and eventually to Mars, and put up a brave front in the midst of the
Trump--Musk row. "NASA will continue to execute upon the President's
vision for the future of space," NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens
said in a post on X. [[In the heat of their spat, Musk tweeted that
SpaceX would "immediately" begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft,
before rescinding that decision after a random X user urged him and
Trump to "cool off."]{.mark}]{.underline} The president calmed down as
well, saying he had made no decisions about canceling contracts with
Musk's companies. "I'd be allowed to do that," Trump said on Saturday.
"But I have, I haven't given it any thought." Still, [[SpaceX's role in
any future Golden Dome gambit remains in doubt. "The U.S. would only
save funds from canceling contracts with Musk's firms if it doesn't turn
around and pay other contractors to do the same
things,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Hartung told The Intercept. "So the
'billions and billions' Trump claims could be saved by cutting off
SpaceX will more likely be transferred to other contractors." [Musk
spent almost \$300 million to elect Trump and other Republican
candidates during the 2024 election cycle]{.underline}. Musk became
upset when the recipients of his funds began to follow through on their
promised agenda: extending and expanding Trump's tax cuts, which not
only disproportionately benefit the rich but will increase the national
debt by almost \$2.6 trillion, according to expert analyses. The Big,
Beautiful Bill Act would also pump money into Trumpian priorities like
immigration enforcement while slashing funds for the most vulnerable,
like cutting Medicaid benefits. On Saturday, Trump warned there would be
"very serious consequences" if Musk backs candidates to run against
Republicans who vote in favor of his signature legislation. "Contracts
should be awarded and canceled by contracting officers based on their
merits, not personal relationships," said Taxpayers for Common Sense's
Murphy. "Anything else leads to waste and corruption."
