## Missile Defense Fails

### MD Fails: Epistemology

#### The underlying motivation of every Golden Dome defender is lining the pockets of defense corporations.

[Recent procurement decisions suggest that there may be a desire in both
Congress and the Trump administration to finance traditional contractors
and emerging tech firms alike]{.underline}. The two largest recent
program announcements --- Boeing's selection as the prime contractor for
that F-47 next generation combat aircraft and President Trump's
**[commitment to]{.underline}** a "**[Golden Dome]{.underline}**"
[defense system supposedly geared to protecting the entire United States
from incoming missiles]{.underline} --- will **[offer ample
opportunities to both traditional arms firms and emerging military tech
companies.]{.underline}** The procurement phase of the F-47 program
could cost up to \$20 billion, but as Dan Grazier of the Stimson Center
has noted, that \$20 billion will be "just seed money. The total costs
coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars."
Meanwhile, General Atomics and Anduril are competing to build drone
"wingmen" that would work in coordination with those future F-47s in
battle situations. At this point[, President Trump's Golden Dome isn't a
fully fleshed out concept, but count on one thing: attempting to meet
his goal of a comprehensive, leakproof defense against missiles would
require building large numbers of interceptors and new military
satellites woven together with advanced communications and targeting
systems, at a potential cost over time of **hundreds** of **billions of
dollars**]{.underline}. And [while the big weapons firms may have an
inside track on building the hardware for the Golden Dome, emerging tech
firms are better positioned to produce the software, targeting,
surveillance, and communications components of the system]{.underline}.
Golden Dome is [poised to go forward despite the fact that]{.underline},
as Laura **[Grego]{.underline}** of the Union of Concerned Scientists
**[has asserted]{.underline}**, "[It has been long understood that
defending against a sophisticated nuclear arsenal is technically and
economically unfeasible." But that reality won't stem the flow of
massive quantities of tax dollars into the project, no matter how
unrealistic it may be, since **profits** from producing it will be **all
too realistic**.]{.underline}

### MD Fails: Can't hit ICBMs

#### Current missile domain defense fails, not effective

'realistic' ICBM threats: Study" Breaking Defense

[[A]{.mark} new [study of US missile defenses]{.mark} has [found]{.mark}
that]{.underline} --- after [70 years and some \$350 billion in
investment --- [no]{.mark} "[system]{.mark} thus far [developed]{.mark}
has been [shown to be effective against realistic ICBM
threats]{.mark}"]{.underline} to the homeland. It's a conclusion with
which the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency begs to differ.

[[The study by the American Physical Society]{.mark} (APS) [examined
a]{.mark} hypothetical [North Korean strike and current missile]{.mark}
[defense systems]{.mark}, such as ground-based interceptors, as well as
more futuristic options in development, like directed energy weapons and
space-based interceptors. [It found]{.mark} today's capabilities
[inadequate and future systems unlikely to]{.mark} do the job of
[defending the country in the next **15 years at
least**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- even from a small number of North
Korean missiles.

"Creating a reliable and effective defense against the threat posed by
even the small number of relatively unsophisticated nuclear-armed ICBMs
that it considers remains a daunting challenge," the Feb. 9 APS report,
called "Ballistic Missile Defense: Threats and Challenges" finds.

#### The missile defense systems fails, rendering more radars redundant

https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2017-04-27/north-korean-missiles-wont-be-stopped-by-us-missile-defense

Comparable statements continue to be made by senior officials, conveying
a misleading sense of security to the American people. Most
recently, General Lori J. Robinson[, [the commander of]{.mark} the North
American [Aerospace]{.mark} [Defense]{.mark} Command, [informed]{.mark}
the U.S. Senate [that \"I am extremely confident of our capability
to]{.mark} defend the United States of America and [be able to intercept
an ICBM]{.mark} should it reach our homeland.\"]{.underline}

[[Don\'t bet on it]{.mark}.]{.underline} In flight intercept tests, [the
[performance record of]{.mark} the [G]{.mark}round-[b]{.mark}ased
[M]{.mark}idcourse Defense [system,]{.mark} [America\'s only]{.mark}
missile defense program designed to protect the homeland, [has been
miserable]{.mark} and tells a very different story.]{.underline}

[Since]{.mark} the \$40 billion program was prematurely declared
operational in [2004[,]{.underline}]{.mark}[ ]{.underline}[just three
test]{.mark} intercepts[ have [successfully killed]{.mark} a mock target
[in nine attempts, all highly scripted for success]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[If these]{.mark} tests [were]{.mark} planned [to]{.mark} [fool]{.mark}
U.S. defenses, as North Korea almost certainly would do, the [success
rate would be even lower]{.mark}.

Furthermore, [the p[erformance]{.mark} of the system has been [getting
worse over time]{.mark} when it ought to be getting better.]{.underline}
[Three quarters of]{.mark} the [most recent]{.mark} flight intercept
[tests]{.mark} have [failed to hit the target;]{.mark} that is[, three
failures out of four tries since January 2010. Clearly, [the system
cannot be depended upon to intercept]{.mark} an
[i]{.mark}ntercontinental [b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile from North
Korea]{.underline}.

Homeland missile defense is often described as attempting to hit a
bullet with another bullet. At its peak, a North Korean missile speeding
toward the United States would cruise at about 15,000 miles per hour,
and a launched interceptor would travel at a similar rate. Based on the
immense practical challenges and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
system\'s poor test record[, both [the G]{.mark}overnment
[A]{.mark}ccountability [O]{.mark}ffice [and]{.mark} the
[Pentagon]{.mark}\'s own chief weapons evaluator have [reported]{.mark}
that [test performance]{.mark} has been \"[insufficient to demonstrate
that an operationally useful defense capability
exists.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Despite]{.mark} the ]{.underline}[assurances]{.mark}[ of MDA
officials, presently, these [defense systems have]{.mark} an [uneven
testing record]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The ]{.underline}Government
Accountability Office[ found that the [MDA failed to meet its planned
testing goals]{.mark} in fiscal year (FY) 2019 [due to significant
development delays]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [lack of testing]{.mark} is
[problematic]{.mark} as it [[results in less]{.mark} data to validate
[system capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} These failures are
particularly concerning given the MDA's \$199 billion in funding from
2002 to 2023 and requested \$55 billion from FY 2024 through 2028. This
is an increase of \$8 billion from the requested \$47 billion from FY
2019 through 2023.

In the tests that have occurred, [the [GMD system
has]{.mark} ]{.underline}an approximate [50% success]{.mark} rate in
scripted tests[ [and replacements]{.mark} for these weapons [are years
away]{.mark}.]{.underline} In October of 2019, the Pentagon terminated
its Redesigned Kill Vehicle program, intended for deployment in 2023, to
augment and replace the [GMD's outdated and unreliable]{.mark}
interceptors, [[due to technical design flaws]{.mark}. From]{.underline}
the limited information publicly available, it is difficult to assess
whether 50% can be considered successful, as valuable data can be
derived from any test regardless of its success. [What is clear,
however, is that [GMD is expensive and
not]{.mark}, apparently, [meeting its goals.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

The MDA enacted \$2.8 billion in FY 2023 and requested an additional
\$3.25 billion in FY 2024 for existing GMD and the development of the
Next-Generation Interceptor. In the interim, Congress has asked MDA to
field a separate interceptor by 2026. 

[[There i]{.mark}s a ]{.underline}[long lis]{.mark}t of
[expensive]{.mark} agency [flops]{.mark}[, [including \$2.2 billion
for]{.mark} a [failed sea-based radar]{.mark}, \$5.3 billion on a
scrapped chemical laser system, and ]{.underline}\$2.7 billion on an
ineffective [blimp-based radar system.  ]{.underline}

While the theater missile systems have a better testing record, they are
not immune to reliability concerns. Up until 2006, [THAAD had an
exceedingly poor testing record of 2 out of 16]{.underline}.

## Domain Awareness Fails

[Despite the fact that the cooperation between military domains and the
Arctic countries is considered a success]{.underline}, [[the biggest

\
Without the help of intelligent systems and the merging of data[,
[monitoring the area becomes an insurmountable

Accessed 6/26/25).

Going beyond a published national security strategy, [Trump's
implementation]{.underline} process [may not align with his
priorities]{.underline}. The American people must consider that
[bipolarism will likely occur with Trump meeting his
priorities]{.underline}. [Trumpian **leadership is known to be
inconsistent**]{.underline} with policy decisions. In addition, major
unforeseen **[domestic and global [developments will]{.mark} likely
[impact]{.mark} some of Trump's [U.S. national security
priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which organically happens all the
time in almost every presidential administration.

Another critical point about policy implementation is ensuring the
administration has adequate resources to carry out its priorities.
[Given the significant budget cuts that are happening to the federal
government, [the]{.mark} Trump [administration]{.mark} [needs to
make]{.mark} sure that [they have]{.mark} both "[the ways" and "the
means"]{.mark} to carry out their national security
priorities.]{.underline} During his first 100 days, [President Trump
expressed interest in building next-generation missile defense
systems.]{.underline}\[xxv\] [It is difficult to build and
operationalize these missile defense systems if you do **not have the
personnel and resources in place**.]{.underline} Once again, a
significant [[reduction in the]{.mark} [fed]{.mark}eral [budget]{.mark}
that dismantled many critical departments]{.underline} across the
government may have [[positioned the]{.mark} Trump
[administration]{.mark} to [be]{.mark} more **vulnerable [to not
meet]{.mark}ing its [national security
priorities.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Awareness fails- US capacity and capability.

Changing Arctic" *RAND Corporation*

Accessed 6/26/25)

First, [[the US]{.mark}CG]{.underline}, [even when working with joint
partners, [lacks]{.mark} the [capacity to meet]{.mark} the nation's
[strategic aims in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the United
States has substantial strategic capabilities for operating from or
through the Arctic[, [its capacity and capability]{.mark} for conducting
operations to secure its Arctic interests [are]{.mark} more
[limited]{.mark}]{.underline} than those of other Arctic countries,
[based [on scale]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} key needs in access (surface maritime,
land, and air at tactical and operational -- rather that strategic --
scales), [[domain awareness]{.mark} (e.g., sensors), communications
(satellites, fiber-optic cables, etc.),]{.underline} and logistics
(transportation and energy). Generally speaking, other Arctic countries
have scaled their capabilities and capacity proportionally to their
respective Arctic needs and to reflect the natural hazards and military
threats they are facing, as well as the sizes of their populations and
economies. Similarly, China's polar investments mirror its scientific
and economic ambitions and lack of Arctic territory. [Second, the U.S.
armed services will be challenged in [the Arctic]{.mark} by foreign
military and commercial activities.]{.underline} The Arctic has become
increasingly visible globally through climate change and expectations of
regional economic potential, which may also make [the region more
[vulnerable to]{.mark} the [spillover of geopolitical tensions]{.mark}
or even armed conflict.]{.underline} U.S. armed forces will likely
increasingly contend with strategic competition in this region to
promote U.S. interests and support allies and partners. However, we did
not assess that the Arctic would see an independent conflict caused by
tensions arising over regional economic or other issues. In addition,
U.S. armed forces---especially the USCG, because of its particular
statutory missions that include law-enforcement roles---will need to
monitor the growth in regional commercial activities, both licit and
illicit. The most pressing area will be in continuing to monitor and
manage fisheries, especially anticipated growth in illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing as global demand for protein increases,
fisheries respond to a warming climate, and Indigenous groups in some
areas gain more political and economic autonomy. Growth in tourism,
especially ecotourism, will increase demand for SAR and environmental
response, as well as for customs and border protection. Third, potential
[security risks to USCG forces are largely driven by U.S. capacity and
capability issues]{.underline}. Limitations on U.S. capacity and
capability to scale up for enduring regional presence contribute to
three types of issues: • [First, there are scenarios in which [the
US]{.mark}CG, more generally, [would find it difficult to]{.mark}
[perform self-protection]{.mark} and self-rescue regardless of the
reason (e.g., military threat, law enforcement problem, natural hazard)
for the need. • Second, these limitations set the conditions for
developing a security void in parts of the North American Arctic.
Limited domain awareness, the inability to quickly
communicate]{.underline} relevant information, and a lack of presence to
proactively manage problems place USCG forces at a starting disadvantage
before a bad actor ever makes a move.

## Domain Awareness Works

### Works

#### Domain Awareness works in the Arctic\-\-- Other Countries prove it works

Special Reconnaissance and Sovereignty Assertion

[Considering [Arctic]{.mark} climate [dynamics]{.mark} and
[increased]{.mark} human [activity]{.mark} [on]{.mark} polar [air, land,
and sea]{.mark} routes, the assertion of sovereignty and [the need
for]{.mark} "on the surface" situational [awareness takes]{.mark} on
strategic **[significance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This requirement is
compounded by key challenges that include shortfalls in ice and weather
reporting and forecasting and limitations in command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance due to lack of assets and harsh environmental
conditions.^47^ [[Yet]{.mark} politically, sovereign presence and
**[domain awareness]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} [essential]{.mark}
prerequisites [for Arctic national security]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, [Norwegian Defense Minister]{.mark} Ine Eriksen Søreide
[stated]{.mark} that [she]{.mark} did not want to remilitarize the
\[Arctic\] border, but "at the same time we do have, and [want to have,
situational awareness for]{.mark} [our]{.mark} own [country]{.mark} and
the alliance."^48^ Similarly, since 2006, Canadian Prime Minister
Stephen Harper has placed enormous emphasis on "exercising sovereignty
over Canada's North . . . our number one Arctic foreign policy
priority."^49^ While [these objectives can be]{.mark} partially
[attained with satellite, ship, and aerial]{.mark} platforms, a
comprehensive knowledge of the Arctic physical environment can be
achieved only by an actual human presence on the ground.

[[Hence, with]{.mark} increased [activity in]{.mark} and over
[Arctic]{.mark} waters, [a military's knowledge]{.mark} base
[will]{.mark} need to be [improve]{.mark}d [significantly]{.mark}
concerning the evolving operational environment in the Arctic (including
newly accessible uncharted waterways), as will the military's ability to
conduct search and rescue, disaster response and relief, and
environmental security operations, among other essential missions,
within the Arctic region]{.underline}. [[In this context]{.mark},
[building a]{.mark} greater [capacity for]{.mark} maritime [domain
awareness]{.mark} (MDA) [looms]{.mark} [as]{.mark} an especially
[critical]{.mark} requirement and obligation [for]{.mark} forces
assigned to [the Arctic]{.mark}.^50^]{.underline} One option to achieve
MDA is through the conducting of "on the surface" SR missions by SOF
elements. Special reconnaissance entails reconnaissance and surveillance
actions normally conducted in a clandestine or covert manner to collect
or verify information of strategic or operational significance,
employing military capabilities not normally found in conventional
forces. SR may include collecting information on human activities or
securing data on the meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic
characteristics of a particular area.^51^ For the Arctic, Denmark
provides an excellent model for the use of SOF in SR and sovereignty
operation roles, with Finland offering additional considerations for
this mission.

Although the Danish armed forces currently undertake important tasks in
the Arctic, including enforcement of sovereignty, [[Denmark's]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} posture there will inevitably have to adjust to [take
on new roles and capabilities, such as wider]{.mark} ranging patrol and
[domain awareness]{.mark} missions within Greenland]{.underline}, a
desirable territory rich in both oil and precious metals.^52^ The launch
of the Danish Defense Force (DDF) Greenland-headquartered Joint Arctic
Command in October 2012 initiated plans to expand training and
deployment of special operations forces to reinforce Denmark's
sovereignty over its Arctic territories, which extend to 1.6 million
square miles.^53 ^The Arctic command organization took over
responsibility for the SOF Arctic defense unit known as the Sirius
Patrol, which has spearheaded the DDF's long-range reconnaissance
patrols in Greenland since 1941, often operating in temperatures as low
as -67°F, while overseeing sovereignty enforcement in the remote reaches
of Greenland. These multiple, two-man teams with dogs operate for long
periods over 160,000 square kilometers of Arctic terrain to provide
real-time presence, reporting, and surveillance to assert Danish
sovereignty over its polar realm. Many of the DDF's core SOF, past and
present, have sharpened their survival and reconnaissance skills on
Sirius missions.^54^

reopening Soviet-era military installations. 

[\"[Russia]{.mark} continues to [pose\[s\] a]{.mark}n acute [threat to

\"[Russia has]{.mark} [continued to build]{.mark} up [its]{.mark}

claims over Arctic waters.\" ]{.underline}

Russia is also partnering with China, Hicks said, and this presents
additional concerns for U.S. defense. 

\"We\'ve seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the
Arctic, commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian
energy exploitation in the Arctic, and increasingly militarily, with
Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska,\"
Hicks said. [\"All of [these challenges have been amplified

with three lines of effort, including enhancing the capabilities of the
joint force, greater engagement with allies and partners and exercising
U.S. presence in the Arctic. 

[\"[Our]{.mark} Arctic strategy adopts a [\'monitor and
respond]{.mark},\' [approach]{.mark} in the region,\" Hicks said. \"It
[is underpinned by]{.mark} robust [domain awareness]{.mark} and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, cooperation
with our allies and partners [and deterrent power]{.mark} enabled
[by]{.mark} the agility of the joint force. The strategy focuses on
[enhancing our domain awareness and Arctic capabilities]{.mark},
engaging with our allies and partners and exercising calibrated presence
in the region.\"]{.underline}

Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and
global resilience, said mission enhancement includes, among other
things, a focus on domain awareness in the Arctic. 

[\"[We must improve our domain awareness and]{.mark} enhance our
[ability to detect]{.mark} and respond with our Canadian allies to
[threats to the homeland]{.mark},\" Ferguson said.]{.underline} \"A key
focus for my office is championing investments that will enhance our
awareness of threats in the region. We want to make sure that we have
the right sensing architecture and the right communications architecture
for command and control.\" 

[Also, a target for operational enhancements in the Arctic are
enhancements to communications and data architecture; intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities; infrastructure; and cold
weather equipment and mobility. ]{.underline}

With seven of the eight Arctic nations also members of NATO, the U.S.
has great partnership opportunities in the region. [[The]{.mark}
[strategy directs the U.S.]{.mark} to take advantage of those
partnerships and others, as a way [to strengthen]{.mark} U.S.

[[The bill]{.mark}, a sprawling \$4.9 trillion package packed with tax

through]{.mark} the House last month [by a]{.mark} razor-[thin 215-214
vote]{.mark}, [with two]{.mark} [Republicans]{.mark} breaking ranks to
[vote \"no]{.mark}.\" [Now]{.mark}, [it]{.mark} [faces]{.mark} fierce
[opposition]{.mark} and internal squabbles in the Senate.]{.underline}

[[At the heart]{.mark} of the Senate\'s turmoil is [the proposed \$1
trillion in Medicaid cuts]{.mark} over the next decade. The Senate\'s
version [seek]{.mark}s [to]{.mark} [phase]{.mark} [out]{.mark} [special
provider taxes]{.mark}, ramp up work requirements and impose tighter
eligibility restrictions, even on parents of school-age children.

changes]{.mark} could [devastate rural hospitals]{.mark} and [low-income

Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to The Wall Street Journal.

[[Public anxiety]{.mark} [mirrors these concerns]{.mark}. KFF polling

[difficult]{.mark}\" [to afford prescription drugs]{.mark}; 59 percent
fear [they wouldn\'t be able to see a health care provider]{.mark}; 56

[[Immoral. Grotesque.]{.mark} [That\'s how Republican Sen. Ron Johnson
has described President Trump\'s]{.mark} massive domestic policy
[bill]{.mark} meant to enact core elements of the president\'s agenda.

unacceptable.\"]{.underline}Now that Trump\'s \"One Big Beautiful Bill
Act\" is in the hands of the Senate, [some fiscal hawks --- including
[Republicans like Johnson --- are pushing back.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
senator said he wants to return spending to pre-pandemic levels and
break up the House bill into separate Senate bills. The bill would cut
taxes, change federal food benefits and put work requirements on
Medicaid, among many other things. \"We want people to get good-paying
jobs so they can support themselves,\" Johnson said. \"We need to ...
get people jobs so that they\'re off of welfare, so they\'re not
dependent on the federal government. That\'s not good for them and
that\'s not, certainly, good for the federal budget.\"Johnson\'s
comments come the same week Elon Musk expressed his disdain for the
president\'s proposed spending agenda. [\"I think people recognize
\[Musk\] as a very smart individual who did a fabulous job with DOGE ---
exposing waste, fraud and abuse,\" Johnson told NPR. \"\[Musk\]
understands numbers and now he\'s stepped away from the administration.

### Will Pass

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Monday that [lawmakers in his
chamber will remain in Washington, D.C., until they pass President
Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill."]{.underline} "Senators return to
Washington today and we will remain here until this bill is passed," he
wrote in an op-ed on Fox News. [The comments are a sign of the
increasing pressure Thune faces to win over Republican holdouts who
still oppose the megabill, ahead of a self-imposed July 4
deadline.]{.underline} [Thune wrote that he is "confident" the Senate
will get the bill "across the finish line."]{.underline} Congress was
set to be on recess the week of July 4, meaning this week was
effectively the deadline for lawmakers to pass the package and get it to
Trump's desk. But as the deadline nears, Thune is still drawing pushback
from his conference, including a group of fiscal hawks who are concerned
the package will explode the national debt. For instance, Sen. Ron
Johnson, R-Wis., has repeatedly criticized the bill, warning it would
add trillions of dollars to national deficits. "What we should be doing
is bending the curve of deficits down. In this reconciliation process,
we're not even coming close," Johnson said on CNBC's "Squawk Box"
earlier this month. Despite the blowback from some GOP lawmakers, Thune
has repeatedly signaled that he intends to stick to the deadline. Thune
said last week that he was hopeful his chamber would take up the bill by
the middle of this week, Politico reported. The White House has also
repeatedly stood by the July 4 deadline. ["It's imperative the Senate
returns this historic piece of legislation on July 4th!"]{.underline}

Republican [leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
released legislation Sunday that includes nearly \$25 billion of funding
to begin work for President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome"
initiative]{.underline}. Put forward by HASC Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers
of Alabama and SASC Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, [the
reconciliation bill would give a \$150 billion boost to defense
spending]{.underline}. By using the budget reconciliation process,
[Republican lawmakers are hoping to expedite funding towards 11
high-priority defense issues without threat of a Senate
filibuster]{.underline}. "This [legislation represents a generational
upgrade for our nation's defense capabilities, including historic
investments in new technology]{.underline}," Wicker said in a statement.
"[This is about building the future of American defense, achieving peace
through strength, and ultimately deterring war]{.underline}." [The
Golden Dome missile defense shield would receive \$24.7 billion to help
kick off the massive project]{.underline}, if the legislation is
approved. [The vision for the effort was introduced via an executive
order signed by Trump in January]{.underline} and looks to field a
multi-layered, homeland defense architecture able to defeat a range of
missile threats. As outlined in the EO, [Golden Dome would comprise both
existing Defense Department programs as well as nascent technologies ---
such as space-based sensors and weapons.]{.underline} To that end,
[lawmakers added around \$15.6 billion for space systems under
"next-generation missile defense technologies," according to the bill
text. That includes \$7.2 billion for development and procurement of new
space-based sensors, \$5.6 billion to develop space-based and boost
phase intercept capabilities, and \$2 billion for air-moving target
indicator satellites.]{.underline} The bill also puts money towards
other emerging technology efforts. If approved, the legislation would
add \$2.4 billion to development of non-kinetic missile defense effects
like electronic warfare and cyber capabilities. In addition, the
Pentagon's Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed
(MACH-TB) effort --- which aims to accelerate flight testing for
hypersonic weapons --- would receive \$400 million. As for "layered
homeland defense" initiatives, lawmakers are proposing \$2.2 billion to
accelerate hypersonic defense systems and \$1.9 billion for improvements
to ground-based missile defense radars. The bill would also add \$800
million for expedited development and deployment of next-generation
intercontinental ballistic missile defense systems. Besides efforts
related to Golden Dome, the reconciliation bill proposes additional
funds towards other key defense priorities such as shipbuilding and
munitions production capacity. Notably, lawmakers also allocated around
\$14 billion towards rapid fielding of emerging capabilities ---
including small unmanned aerial systems, command-and-control
technologies and attritable weapon systems --- as well as improving
integration with the commercial sector. "This [legislation is a historic
investment of \$150 billion to restore America's military capabilities
and strengthen our national defense]{.underline}," Rogers said in a
statement. "[America's deterrence is failing and without a generational
investment in our national defense, we will lose the ability to defeat
our adversaries. With this bill, we have the opportunity to get back on
track and restore our national security and global
leadership."]{.underline} HASC will hold a markup session for the
reconciliation bill on Tuesday where members can submit amendments,
after which it will be sent to the House Budget Committee.
