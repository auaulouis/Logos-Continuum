## Russia Good

### General---not revisionist

#### Russia is not revisionist. It is a status quo power that wants to ward off against US revisionism.

**Krickovic**, Andrej **22** -- associate professor of political science

University of California, Berkeley. (\"Revisionism revisited: developing
a typology for classifying Russia and other revisionist
powers.\" *International Politics* 59, no. 4 (2022): 616-639)

Let us begin by considering Russia's stance toward the two elements of
the existing status quo order sketched out above. [**[Russia]{.mark} is
clearly dissatisfied** with the global hierarchies of power and status.
It [opposes US]{.mark} unipolar [dominance]{.mark} and is deeply
dissatisfied with US leadership. It objects to **[the way the
USA]{.mark}** sees itself as an indispensable power that [is allowed to
break the rules]{.mark} that [everyone else is expected to
follow]{.mark} while, at the same time, **[unilaterally revising them as
it sees fit]{.mark}** and without consulting the other great
powers]{.underline} (Lukin 2014; Suslov 2016). It is also dissatisfied
with its place in the global status hierarchy, which it sees as being in
decline and in danger of losing its great power status (Krickovic and
Weber 2018). However, [**[its aims]{.mark}**, as far as altering the
established hierarchies, **[are limited.]{.mark}** [It does not want
to]{.mark} knock the USA out of the top position and **[take]{.mark}**
the mantle of **[global leadership]{.mark}** for itself, aims that are
attributed to revisionist powers in most of the standard accounts of
"unlimited aims" or "revolutionary" revisionism]{.underline}
(Buzan 1991; Schweller 1998). [Instead, [it wants]{.mark} to engineer
the transition to a **[multipolar]{.mark}** **[concert]{.mark}** of
great powers [where **the USA could still retain the top
spot**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the most powerful and influential state
in the system, [but where it would give up its special prerogatives and
accept **the status of first among equals**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[**[Russia wants to preserve]{.mark} many of the elements of [the
present order]{.mark}**[, such as **sovereignty** and
**noninterference**]{.mark}, which it believes to be [under threat from
**US revisionism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lukyanov 2014; Karaganov 2017).

Pinning down Russia's position toward the normative order is more
complicated. [**[Russian leaders]{.mark}** and **analysts** i[nsist that
**their country is not looking to overthrow the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[rules]{.mark}**[, **[norms]{.mark}**, [and **institutions** of
the]{.mark} UN-Centric, **[Westphalian order]{.mark}** established at
the end of WWII and look to portray their country as **a champion of the
existing normative order**]{.underline} (Karaganov 2017; Suslov 2016).
[From their point of view, [it is **the USA that has been acting as a
revisionist power** by **invading Iraq**]{.mark} without a U.N. mandate,
**[violating]{.mark}** the territorial **[sovereignty of
Serbia]{.mark}** in supporting Kosovo's secession and independence, [and
**promoting "Color Revolutions**]{.mark}**"** in the Middle East and
Post-Soviet space. **[In opposing]{.mark}** these [**US policies**,
Russia is]{.mark} not trying to undermine the existing normative order
but rather is [**working** toward its **conservation**]{.mark} and
restoration]{.underline} (Lukin 2014; Lukyanov 2016).

#### Claims of Russian revanchism are Western hypocrisy. Russia is opposed to Western influence, not liberal norms per se.

**Krickovic**, Andrej **22** -- associate professor of political science

a typology for classifying Russia and other revisionist
powers.\" *International Politics* 59, no. 4 (2022): 616-639)

Most contemporary [[accounts of **Russian revisionism**]{.mark} either
see Russia as a revanchist power focused on the irredentist goals of
recovering its lost territories and imperial influence in the
post-Soviet space]{.underline} (Clover 2016; Toal 2017) [or]{.underline}
portray Russia as an ideological revisionist, [[bent on **rolling
back**]{.mark} **liberal [democracy]{.mark}** in order to protect its
authoritarian domestic political regime]{.underline} (Fish 2018;
McFaul 2020, 2021). The former frequently invoke Putin's famous quote
that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the biggest "geopolitical
tragedy of the twentieth century" and the anti-Western and nationalist
Eurasianist ideology as evidence for their claims (Clover 2016). While
the latter point to Russia's support for populist political forces in
the West and meddling in Western elections as [proof that Russia is
determined to undermine liberalism and democracy worldwide]{.underline}
(Fish 2018; McFaul 2020, 2021).

[Those who see Russia as a revanchist power tend to **overstate Russia's
commitment** to irredentism]{.underline} in the post-Soviet space [and
[**overestimate** the **influence** that]{.mark} radical **[nationalist
ideologies have]{.mark}** over the Russian public. [With the exception
of Crimea]{.mark}, **[Russia has been reluctant to press irredentist
claims]{.mark}** or to even protect ethnic Russian nationals in the
post-Soviet Space]{.underline} (Trenin 2011). [More typical is its use
of "frozen conflicts" to advance larger geopolitical goals, such as
keeping countries such as Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine]{.underline} in
a permanent state of instability and conflict and thus [out of NATO and
the E.U.]{.underline} While [**[Russian]{.mark}**
neo-[imperialists]{.mark}]{.underline} and Eurasianists are a vocal
presence in the country's political landscape, they [[remain]{.mark}
largely [on the margins when it comes to influencing]{.mark} the
[decisions]{.mark} made by the political leadership]{.underline}
(Laruelle 2016). Rather than influencing the regime to advance their
ideological agendas, it is the regime that has used modern-day
imperialists to mobilize support for aggressive state policies among
certain segments of the population, in much the same way that the
Tsarist government used the Pan-Slavic movement in the nineteenth
century (ibid.).

[[Studies]{.mark} that portray Russia as an ideological
revisionist]{.underline} (Fish 2018; McFaul 2020, 2021) [[overstate
Russia's opposition to]{.mark} liberal [democracy]{.mark}. **[For all
its animosity toward liberalism]{.mark}** and democracy, [t**he Kremlin
goes to great lengths** to **preserve**]{.mark} the façade of [**liberal
democratic practices** in Russia]{.mark}'s domestic
politics]{.underline}. [Russia's opposition to Western democracy
promotion efforts and interference in political processes in the West
are motivated more by its concerns about regime stability, declining
influence, and global status, than by any sustained ideological
opposition to liberal democracy per se]{.underline} (Tsygankov 2015).
[[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} vehemently [[opposed to the Western
democracy promotion]{.mark} agenda]{.underline}, and especially to
"Color Revolutions" in the post-Soviet space [[because they represent a
threat to its regional influence]{.mark} and to domestic political
stability]{.underline} (Duncan 2012). [[Moscow]{.mark} has shown that it
is ready to [accept]{.mark} the results of ["Color Revolutions" when
they do not threaten]{.mark} to erode [its influence]{.mark}, as was the
case in **[Kirgizstan]{.mark}** in 2010 [or]{.mark} in
**[Armenia]{.mark}** in 2018]{.underline} (Saradzhyan 2018). Claims that
Russia is mounting a campaign to undermine liberal democracy in the West
have yet to be substantiated. While there is considerable evidence of
Russian meddling in Western elections, the extent of this meddling
remains unclear, and the true intentions behind it are difficult to
ascertain. It is unlikely, however, that Russian meddling was intended
to influence outcomes or get their preferred candidates elected
(Lukyanov 2016; Sakwa 2020). Russian interference seems to have been
geared toward delegitimizing and weakening U.S. Presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton, whom most Russian observers feared would take a tough
line against Russia if elected, rather than in electing Donald Trump
(Lukyanov 2016.). R[ussian analysts see their country's meddling as
payback for what most Russians believe to be decades of Western meddling
in Russia's domestic politics]{.underline} and a signal to the West that
Russia has now developed these same capabilities (Suslov 2016).

### General---West revisionist

#### The liberal international order is buried in Gaza and in Fordow. Every claim about Russian aggression or revisionism must be filtered through the West's [track record]{.underline} of obliterating every single international norm and law.

**Dodman 6-22**-- journalist based in Paris (Benjamin, "Israel-Iran
conflict 'drives the final nail into the coffin' of postwar world order"

Edited for ableist lang. in brackets: \[\] updated June 22, 2025)

Twenty months on, [[**Israel has flattened Gaza**, **bombed**]{.mark}
swathes of [**Lebanon**, **seized**]{.mark} further [**territory
in Syria**, and]{.mark} now **[launched a]{.mark} direct [attack
on Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it pursues what it describes as an
"existential" fight against the Islamic Republic and its allies in the
region. 

Throughout the fighting, [its ultra-nationalist leaders have dismissed
the mounting evidence of war crimes]{.underline} committed [in
Gaza]{.underline}, which led the International Criminal Court to issue
an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in November
2024.  

Senior [[cabinet members have]{.mark} openly
[advocated]{.mark}]{.underline} the forced removal of Gaza's population,
which would amount to a [**[genocid]{.mark}**al crime]{.underline}, and
the [dismemberment of Syria.]{.underline}
[[Netanyahu]{.underline}]{.mark} himself h[as [discussed]{.mark} the
possibility of assassinating Iran's head of state and precipitating
"**[regime change]{.mark}**"]{.underline} in the Islamic Republic in
interviews with US media. 

Ironically, such rhetoric brings Israel closer in line with the
inflammatory bluster typical of its arch-foe Iran -- with the important
difference that Israel does possess nuclear weapons and a military
capable of backing up its increasingly provocative statements. 

[The extraordinary escalation is a "natural consequence of the impunity
that has prevailed in the region over the past two years]{.underline}\",
says H. A. Hellyer, a senior research fellow at the Royal United
Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) in London. 

"[The fact **[that Israel has faced no consequence for repeatedly
infringing i]{.mark}nternational [law sends a]{.mark} very [clear
signa]{.mark}l**: that if it chooses to do more, it can,]{.underline}"
he explains. "[And i**t can count on the most powerful actors** in the
international community simply not doing very much or actually
**empowering** and emboldening **it**." ]{.underline}

The most immediate consequence of Israeli impunity in the Middle East is
the immense suffering inflicted on civilian populations, nowhere more so
than in Gaza, where Israel's ongoing military campaign has killed more
55,000 people, according to local health officials, and rendered the
narrow strip of land largely uninhabitable. 

[A]{.underline}nother [consequence]{.underline}, with more far-reaching
implications, i[s the further **[erosion of the rules-based
order]{.mark}** in place since World War II, says Karim Emile
**Bitar**, a Middle East expert at Beirut's Saint-Joseph University and
visiting **professor at Sciences-Po Paris.** ]{.underline}

["**Recent events have driven [the final nail into the coffin of
i]{.mark}nternational [law and]{.mark}** of what has been referred to as
**[the l]{.mark}**iberal **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[o]{.mark}**rder,"]{.underline} he says. "[The message to the world is
that if might is on your side, **[you can break all the rules]{.mark}**,
trample on international law and all the standards that have been in
place since 1945, and **[there will be]{.mark} absolutely [no
accountability]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

'A new Middle East' 

Netanyahu has described Israel's actions as ushering in a "new Middle
East", a phrase that has haunted the region at least since the 2003 Iraq
War, when the US and its allies sought to remodel it -- with
catastrophic consequences.  

"There has been a lot of jubilation (among critics of Iran), imagining
that these are the 'birth pangs' of some sort of new Middle East. On the
contrary, this is a spiral of violence, fostered by an environment of
impunity that allows for vigilante action to take place without
repercussions," says Hellyer. 

"Nobody needs to be a fan of the Iranian regime, or Hezbollah or Hamas,
to see that this activity is incredibly destabilising for regional order
and security," he adds. "It also has massive repercussions for
international order and international security, because it means that
**[[there isn\'t a rules-based order at all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
becomes the law of the jungle. And that should be quite concerning to
all of us." 

Bitar notes that few people in the Sunni Arab world will be "shedding a
tear" for the Iranian regime -- "and for good reason, given the
disruption and suffering caused by Tehran's regional proxies\".  

However, he adds, "they are also alarmed by an increasingly unbridled
Israel, which -- unlike Iran -- has the means to wipe out entire cities,
and whose senior ministers now openly advocate ethnic cleansing in
Gaza\". 

An immediate consequence is likely to be a regional arms race to try to
narrow the gap with Israel. In Iran's case, analysts point to the
likelihood of a fresh push to go nuclear, thereby achieving the exact
opposite of the stated goal of Israel's military operation. 

"Israel\'s attack is making Iran feel very vulnerable. Their
conventional deterrence has failed, and I think we're going to see more
and more calls from within the country to pursue nuclear weapons," says
D[aryl Kimball of the US-based Arms Control Association]{.underline},
noting that contrary to Israeli claims, Western intelligence
assessments have so far concluded that Tehran is not currently pushing
to militarise its nuclear programme.

Kimball says there are already voices in Iran calling for the country to
withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which prohibits
states that don't have nuclear weapons from pursuing them. 

["Bombing (Iran) simply makes sure they will try a hundred times more
because they will assess there is no rules-based order, there is simply
the threat of force and mutually assured destruction]{.underline}," adds
Hellyer. 

'Anticipatory' self-defence 

[The phrase "birth pangs of a new Middle East" was famously used by
former US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice to refer to the 2006
Israel-Hezbollah war, one of many conflicts with roots in the regional
upheaval caused by the US invasion of Iraq.  ]{.underline}

"[Back then, there was at least a stated aim to promote democracy and
human rights in the region, even if it was largely a
smokescreen]{.underline}," says Bitar. "[Now there is no such
pretence.]{.underline} We're back to Bismarckian power politics, in
which might precedes right, and [a world governed by nationalist
authoritarian leaders]{.underline} in the mould of Putin and Trump."   

In the present climate, he adds, "**[the dwindling number of [people who
talk about respect for i]{.mark}nternational [law are]{.mark} regarded
as [hopeless idealists disconnected from
reality]{.mark}\".]{.underline}** 

While Israel's attack on Iran has drawn condemnation around the world,
the messaging from Western leaders has been far more mixed, with talk of
Israel's "right to defend itself" often taking precedence over
references to international law. 

Hours after Israel launched the first wave of attacks, French
President Emmanuel **[Macron]{.underline}**, whose planned summit on a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was scuttled by
the outbreak of war, [put the blame squarely on Iran and said France
stood ready to defend Israel]{.underline} if necessary. 

**[Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz]{.underline}** [went]{.underline}
a step [further]{.underline}, [arguing that Israel was "doing the dirty
job for all of us" by taking on in the Iranian regime]{.underline} --
prompting outcry in a country where the emphasis is normally on
de-escalation.  

In an op-ed published by the Guardian, [Sydney-based international law
professor Ben Saul argued that support for Israel's "right to
self-defence\" had no legal grounding in the present conflict and set a
dangerous precedent. ]{.underline}

He described Israel's attack on Iran as "part of a pattern of unlawful
'anticipatory' violence against other countries", along with its recent
destruction of Syrian military bases and equipment, despite "the absence
of any attack by the new Syrian authorities on Israel". 

"The risk of abuse of 'anticipatory' self-defence is simply too great,
and too dangerous, for the world to tolerate," Saul wrote, noting
that Russia claimed to invade Ukraine "in part because it speculatively
feared NATO expansion". He added: "Many countries have hostile relations
with other countries. Allowing each country to unilaterally decide when
they wish to degrade another country's military, even when they have not
been attacked, is a recipe for global chaos -- and for the unjustified
deaths of many innocent people." 

'One pillar of the post-war order is attacking another' 

In an interview with Middle East Eye, Sir Richard Dalton, a former
British ambassador to Tehran, noted that past US administrations had
refused to countenance a large-scale Israeli attack on Iran, but that
Netanyahu "has obtained more leverage over the US (since Donald Trump's
return to power) and Israel is more of a law unto itself". 

Dalton said other [Western countries had been "incredibly limp in not
holding Israel to account]{.underline}" for its conduct over the past 20
months, [a stance he attributed in part to their growing disregard for
international law. ]{.underline}

["They don't look at the legal issue. They won't look at the
circumstances in international law when a pre-emptive strike against a
potential enemy is lawful and when it is not," he said. "Israel's strike
was an illegal aggression. But [we're prepared to talk frankly]{.mark}
in those terms **[about Russia but not about
Israel.]{.mark}**" ]{.underline}

While Western powers have failed to rein in the violence, the
institutions they helped found decades ago to uphold the rules-based
order have not sat idle.  

Since the start of the Gaza war, both [the **[ICC]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
the]{.underline} International Court of
Justice (**[[ICJ]{.underline}]{.mark}**) have moved with urgency, the
latter issuing successive rulings last year to warn of the risk of
genocide in Gaza and order an end to Israel's military operations in the
south of the enclave. [[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark} court, however,
[[has the capacity to enforce]{.mark} international law [if]{.mark}
[world powers refuse]{.mark} to comply. ]{.underline}

[When the ICC issued its arrest warrant for Netanyahu, former US
president Joe Biden described the move as "outrageous". His successor at
the White House has gone a step further, issuing an executive order in
January to authorise sanctions on the court]{.underline} over its
"illegitimate" actions against the US and its "close ally Israel". 

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[withdrawn]{.mark} the US [from]{.mark}
several [UN bodies]{.mark} and slashed the organisation's
funding]{.underline}, creating a situation in which "one pillar of the
post-war order is attacking another", according to Brian Brivati,
visiting professor of contemporary history and human rights at Kingston
University. 

"The leading founder of the UN is now undermining the institution from
within, wielding its security council veto to block action while
simultaneously starving the organisation of resources," Brivati wrote on
The Conversation earlier this week. 

"[The combination of a powerful state acting with impunity and a
superpower]{.underline} ~~disabling~~ [\[breaking\] the mechanisms of
accountability marks [a global inflection point]{.mark},]{.underline}"
he added. "Other global powers, including Russia and China, are taking
this opportunity to move beyond the Western rules-based system."

**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[o]{.mark}**rder--- [**as unfavorable**,
**Russia has shown strong support for**]{.mark} **a [rules‐based order
in the Arctic]{.mark}** region. Developments in **[the law of the
sea]{.mark}** from 1945 through the 1970s added vast maritime areas to
the jurisdiction of the coastal state.]{.underline} The legal concepts

[[put]{.mark} an unimaginable wealth of **[natural resources]{.mark}**

In addition to legal developments, [[**Russia has played a defining

and **shaped [Arctic governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pedersen, 2012).
[These include [the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}]{.underline} (the Arctic

and special stewardship role that derived from their "sovereignty,
sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in large parts of the Arctic Ocean"
(Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2008, p. 1). [**Other [regional

"Russia's Military Posture in the Arctic"
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2019/06/russias-military-posture-arctic/6-military-implications-other-arctic-states-nato-and-its
October 15, 2024)

Keeping the Arctic as a separate area of operation is impossible: what
happens in the Arctic, Moscow would argue, does not begin in the Arctic
and nor would it stay there. This applies both to 'vertical escalation'
(i.e. military flashpoints that would enlarge in geographical scope
towards the Arctic as violence expanded) and to 'horizontal escalation'
(i.e. a spill-over effect from another theatre of operation, notably the
Baltic Sea). The same logic also applies to situations combining a mix
of both vertical and horizontal escalation, for example if a local
outbreak of violence were to spread out across the Arctic during a
theatre-wide conflict. Indeed, military assets and concepts of
operations in the **[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arctic are part of
a wider, coordinated strategy.

The [**[military leadership is opposed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the idea of starting [**[a conflict in the
Arctic]{.mark}**. On the contrary]{.underline}, [**[it would aim to
push]{.mark} any [conflict away from the region]{.mark}**
towards]{.underline} SLOC in the North Atlantic and towards [the Baltic
Sea]{.underline}. [The goal would be **to [remove tensions]{.mark}**
[from the]{.mark} Russian [Arctic **as quickly as
possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and to establish perimeter control for
protection of the Kola Peninsula. This is [[**justified** by]{.mark} the
**necessity** of ensuring [the **survivability** of]{.mark} **Russia's
[sea-based nuclear deterrent]{.mark}**, [as well as]{.mark} for ensuring
[freedom of **navigation**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the Northern Fleet and
strategic **[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

As elsewhere, Russia's primary threat perception in relation to the
Russian Arctic concerns NATO's military capabilities and projected
intentions. [Russia's approach to the region is]{.underline} therefore
not about the Arctic itself, but [about mitigating the potential impact
of]{.underline} the presence of [NATO and US troop]{.underline}s beyond
the North Atlantic. Seen from the Kremlin, most of the
Arctic *is* Russian, and the non-Russian Arctic *is* NATO. Indeed, four
of the five Arctic coastal nations are members of NATO.

Any move from NATO and its allies to build military capabilities in the
Arctic, whether through exercises or posturing, will undoubtedly feed
Russia's 'besieged fortress' logic. In broad terms, the Kremlin is
concerned that NATO forces could challenge Russia's sense of military
superiority in the region.109 This could endanger the understanding that
the Arctic should remain as a designated 'low tension' area, thus
pushing Russia to overreact and increasing the risk of miscalculation.

Is Russia 'militarizing' the Arctic?

One of the principal debates around Russia's military activity in the
Arctic relates to whether Moscow is 'militarizing' the AZRF. Clarifying
this issue is important. Although the scope of military activity in the
Russian Arctic seems impressive in isolation, it is not commensurate
either with the region's geographical scale or with the nature of the
theatre of operation. [Overall, the presence of Russian troops and
assets remains sparse and fragmented]{.underline} in relative terms.

[[**Most Russian capabilities** are not]{.mark} intended to
project]{.underline} [**[offensive]{.mark} means** but merely
to take]{.underline} back [control of the Arctic coast and
waters]{.underline} along the AZRF. **[[Russia has a fundamentally
defensive understanding of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russian
military capabilities and deployments should be assessed in terms of
perimeter defence -- involving the Bastion concept of protection for the
Kola Peninsula and Russia's sea-based nuclear deterrent.

With military capabilities in disarray [since the fall of the Soviet
Union, the rebuilding of Russian forces is starting from a very low
point.110 Even [today]{.mark}, following several years of modernization,
**[deployments]{.mark}** **[fall short of their Soviet
equivalent]{.mark}**s. In this context, [Russia is simply
re-establishing a]{.mark} military [presence that used to be the
norm]{.mark} during the Cold War. This pattern is not
Arctic-specific per se, but is a trend observed in other military
districts and in a broader perspective.]{.underline}111

There is indeed '**[militarization']{.underline}** of the AZRF, but
[deployments and **activities** remain for now 'more eyes and ears than
muscle]{.underline}'.112 Russia's military presence in the Arctic is
also a reflection of a broader trend observed in other theatres. As
such, Russia's build-up is more a military reinvestment in the Russian
Arctic than for the Arctic.113 By the same logic, strategic assets on
the Kola Peninsula happen to be located in the Arctic but do not affect
the region itself in terms of operations.114 Military thinking is driven
by the imperative to bridge existing vulnerabilities due to 'fading
control'115 in a region where Russia used to consider itself
invulnerable; recent deployments aim to fill these perceived gaps. As so
often in Russia, any vacuum is filled by military means.

risk.**

Given all these factors, what might a freedom of navigation operation
along the Northern Sea Route look like? The new Russian legislation
opens additional opportunities. [A pair of [warships could challenge
Russia]{.mark}'s claims]{.underline}, by entering the Kara Gate without
requesting permission. The most likely opportunity for conducting such
an operation would be in September, when the annual sea ice in the area
is at its minimum. 

**[[The]{.mark} U.S. [Navy]{.mark} has frequently operated in the High
North]{.underline}** with allies and it is likely that a freedom of
navigation operation along the Northern Sea Route would be a
multilateral operation. Such an approach would also strengthen the
message of NATO unity. Given the United Kingdom's interest and increased
activity in the High North, it appears a likely partner. Norway's
extensive knowledge of the area and the Russian military would be an
important asset, though it is less likely that the Norwegian government
would directly join the operation, given differences in naval potential
and ambition.

Geographically, [the transit passage [could run in **close proximity**
to **critical**]{.mark} **Russian [military
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region. Although not
formally part of the Northern Sea Route, [the passage of ships in this
area would likely bring them [close to]{.mark}]{.underline} the Kola
Peninsula, which hosts [bases for **Russian [nuclear]{.mark}**-armed
**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Importantly, some
parts of the Northern Sea Route are significantly more sensitive than
others. The passage through the Kara Gate south of Novaya Zemlya is one
example. Novaya Zemlya is Russia's nuclear weapons test area and now is
a test bed for new weapon systems. [It is also the location of an air
base at Rogachevo]{.underline}. Likewise, Moscow would likely be
concerned about what foreign sensors may catch at the bottom of the
sea. 

What's at Stake?

A freedom of navigation operation in the region carries inherent risks.
The Kremlin has cultivated the image of Russia as the leading Arctic
power and this is a potent domestic symbol of national strength and
pride. Under current domestic conditions, Russia's political response is
difficult to predict. It remains equally uncertain how such an operation
would be handled by the Russian commander once ships meet, especially if
the commander is under pressure: What would be his reading of the
situation, of NATO's intentions, and of Moscow's wishes? The potential
for misunderstanding cannot be excluded. As recent Russian exercises
have attempted to demonstrate, the Northern Fleet, possibly supported by
the border guard of the Federal Security Service, could attempt to block
passage. We could see Russian commanders operating in unsafe proximity
to U.S. and NATO platforms, as often demonstrated in the Black Sea
region. 

Furthermore, there are operational risks involved in high-latitude
operations. The Russian Arctic, especially the eastern parts of the
Northern Sea Route, is a harsh and unforgiving operational environment,
remote and with scarce infrastructure. Naval exercises at lower
latitudes --- notably Trident Juncture --- faced hardships operating in
the Arctic environment. The conditions are rapidly evolving and there is
a possibility of drifting ice even in summer months, so the ships making
the passage should be therefore ice-strengthened or have icebreaker
escort. This would require assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard or an
icebreaker from a NATO ally. Contingencies should be made for other
unforeseen emergencies, too, including an accident during the passage,
either as a result of fire, technical malfunction, or natural disaster. 

These physical challenges would likely be paired with a Russian
diplomatic and information offensive to pressure political leaders in
Washington and elsewhere. Russia could seek to exploit any freedom of
navigation operation by claiming it as a provocation and violation of
international and Russian law and sovereignty.

Hence, how, when, and with what capabilities to conduct a freedom of
navigation operation would need to be carefully calibrated and
coordinated with other allies in the region to manage risks. 

**[Proponents]{.underline}** of a freedom of navigation operation along
the Northern Sea Route could **[argue]{.underline}** that it would build
on the recent U.S. diplomatic challenge to excessive Russian legal
claims. Arguably, the longer a country waits to act, the bigger
challenge a freedom of navigation operation in the region poses. The
risk, of course, is that by not conducting a freedom of navigation
operation, NATO risks sending a signal to Moscow that it *de
facto* accepts its territorial claims. [[**Russia's weaknesses** and
**struggles in Ukraine** could mean that it has **limited capabilities**
and **may choose to avoid**]{.mark} **a [direct confrontation with
NATO.]{.mark} **]{.underline}

### Russia general---no war/defensive

**No escalate to de-escalate---Russian doctrine builds in safeguards
against escalatory spirals.**

**Ven Bruusgaard 22** (Kristin, Assistant Professor of Political
Science, University of Oslo. Director of the Norwegian Intelligence
School. She served as the Deputy Leader of the 2021 Norwegian Government

"escalate to de-escalate"'
https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/07/myths-and-misconceptions-around-russian-military-intent/myth-9-russian-nuclear-strategy
August 23, 2022)

[[Describing Russian]{.mark} nuclear s[trategy as 'escalate to
de-escalate' is]{.mark} an unproductive simplification. It produces
dangerous **[misunderstanding]{.mark}**s]{.underline} that in turn
underestimate what it will take to deter Russian nuclear use. An
exaggerated focus on limited, coercive nuclear use has led analysts to
overemphasize one narrow scenario of nuclear compellence as the sole
problem which Russian strategy poses.

[The [emphasis on]{.mark} very [early nuclear use]{.mark} in Russian
military doctrine [is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[outdated]{.underline}]{.mark}, [stemming from the late
**1990s**]{.underline} and early 2000s when doctrine officially stated
that the nuclear threshold had been lowered. [**[Since]{.mark}** at
least **[2010]{.mark}**, however, **[Russian]{.mark} nuclear [doctrine
has evolved]{.mark}**]{.underline} to account for improvements in its
conventional military capabilities. This doctrine could again change as
a result of the shortcomings in Russian general-purpose forces revealed
in Ukraine. But Russian nuclear doctrine has seemingly not adjusted for
this in the period since the full-scale attack on Ukraine started in
February 2022: [Russian officials continue to insist that **[Russia
would only consider using]{.mark}** nuclear weapons [when]{.mark} the
[**existence** of the **state** is under threat]{.mark} -- that is, when
**Russian territory is being attacked.**]{.underline}

The Western emphasis on the risk of coercive nuclear use conflates
shifts in Russian foreign policy ambitions with a shift in nuclear
strategy. It was only after 2014 that many Western analysts started
arguing that Russia had become a revisionist power with expansionist
goals, and that it could well consider employing nuclear weapons to
promote such goals. This changed the analysis of what Russia might do
with the arsenal of sub-strategic nuclear weapons it had already
possessed for years.

Increased sub-strategic nuclear capabilities produced an interpretation
that the early and limited use of nuclear weapons for compellence
purposes was more likely, and that nuclear escalation would
be inherently attractive to Russia. This ignored the fact that these
sub-strategic nuclear weapons also fulfil a key deterrence task for
Russia -- preventing the outbreak of regional wars. This interpretation
thus represented a view of what Russia could do with its weapons, rather
than an accurate reflection of how Russian strategists conceive of the
problem.

The 'escalate to de-escalate' idea neglects the key task of Russian
nuclear strategy, which is to threaten first use for deterrence. This
primary task of Russian nuclear weapons is clearly conveyed in all
Russian strategy documents of the post-Cold War era. Russian capability
developments -- in the strategic and non-strategic realms -- align with
these key tasks of deterring large-scale war and regional
wars that threaten the very existence of the state. This is the
essential challenge Russian nuclear strategy poses: how to deter nuclear
use in those circumstances. Few nuclear-armed states formulate a
different objective. This objective of de-escalating conflict is also
explicitly stated in US nuclear operations policy.

In short, the myth of a Russian fascination with nuclear coercion
exaggerates Russia's confidence in its ability to control escalation.
[[The **Russian**]{.mark} doctrinal [**threshold** for]{.mark} **nuclear
[use has not changed]{.mark}** **[despite]{.mark}** **significant
[shifts in]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} environment** since 2014. This
indicates that [**Russian leaders remain concerned** about]{.mark} the
prospect of **[nuclear
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[**Statements** by]{.mark} Vladimir
**[Putin]{.mark}** in the past couple of years **[reinforce
this]{.mark}** impression.]{.underline} Russian nuclear signalling
during the war against Ukraine has thus far demonstrated that this
threshold is higher than the proponents of the Russian nuclear
de-escalation theory have claimed. [Russia]{.underline} has sought to
compel Ukraine over a long period, but **[remains reluctant to employ
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** to achieve this objective.

Russian nuclear rhetoric and blackmail have reached such intensity from
the beginning of the Ukraine war that the problem of restoring the
US-Russia framework of strategic arms control and establishing new
multilateral formats for non-strategic nuclear arms control will
necessarily constitute a key part of the post-war European re-engagement
with Russia.54 Remarkably, [[there is]{.mark}]{.underline} also a
[[**strong pushback** in Moscow's expert community **against**]{.mark}
the irresponsible idea of bringing back the nuclear "fear factor" by
[**delivering** a **nuclear strike**]{.mark} on, for example,
Poznan]{.underline}.55 [These sober arguments may [**find**
**support**]{.mark} not only [among]{.mark} the]{.underline}

[engage]{.mark}** in combat operations [on **a nuclear

**[Putin]{.underline}** rejected resolutely and rudely the prospect of
reducing Russia's nuclear arsenal, and, while such [**vulgarity** may be
a feature of his war-affected personal style of doing
business]{.underline}, for every **[[grouping of
elites]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[might find a way to depose
him]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the proposition of giving up Russia's vast
advantage in numbers of non-strategic nuclear warheads would appear
singularly unattractive.56 [[**To alter** this]{.mark} nuclear-centric,
even [**nuclear**-**worshipping** **attitude**]{.mark}]{.underline}, key
European states might find it useful to return in the post-war
environment to the question of security guarantees for Russia, though
certainly [very different in nature and substance from the deliberately
exaggerated claims advanced by Putin]{.underline} in December 2021.

## Bad

### General

#### Russia is a revisionist power structurally inclined towards aggression against the West. They pocket appeasement and cooperation in order to advance these goals---empirics.

March 6, 2025)

In short, [[it was not the West's]{.mark} aggressive pursuit of an
[anti-Russian agenda, but]{.mark} rather [the **weakness**]{.mark} and
lack of strategic clarity it communicated at every turn post-Cold War
**[that encouraged Moscow's revisionism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [It
was]{.underline} not the West's alleged geostrategic assertiveness, but
its [[timidity each time Putin used military power]{.mark} to occupy
territory---first in **[Georgia]{.mark}** in 2008, then in
**[Ukraine]{.mark}** in 2014, in **[Syria]{.mark}** in 2015, and finally
in **[Ukraine for the second time]{.mark}** in 2022---[that set the
stage]{.mark} for the unfolding tragedy in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}.  

If [[the West is responsible]{.mark} for the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, it's not for the reasons its critics now propound, i.e.,
because of its allegedly aggressive behavior, but [because of its
inability to grasp the **basics of power politics**]{.mark} as it swam
into an ideological soup of its own making that bore no resemblance to
how the world really works.  ]{.underline}

[**[The West is poised to communicate weakness once again,]{.mark}**
only this time unabashedly and without pretense that it is doing so
because of norms]{.underline} or the "rules-based international
order." If the final peace agreement on Ukraine simply ratifies the
status quo on the battlefield, the Trump administration will hand Moscow
a major win, in effect undoing the consequences of the Western victory
in the Cold War.

It will communicate in no uncertain terms that Russia can structure its
sphere of domination in Eastern Europe at will, and **[[that the West
will accept Moscow's role as an imperial power]{.underline}]{.mark}**
shaping the future of Europe as a whole. And as the tragedy of Ukraine
reaches its denouement, it should be said that [the culpability for
defeat]{.underline} in Ukraine---a defeat that will effectively reverse
the gains made by the West in the twentieth century---[falls in part on
the United States, [through]{.mark} the [diffident "escalation
management" policy]{.mark} in Ukraine]{.underline} pursued by the Biden
administration.  

The United States' key allies in Europe are also to blame, especially
Germany, the very country that benefitted most from the collapse of the
iron curtain, and then proceeded to do more than any other European
power to bring Russia back into European politics through the nefarious
Nord Stream energy deals and Berlin's policy of engaging with Moscow
irrespective of Washington's warnings---including from the first Trump
administration---and above the heads of the countries threatened
by Russia along the Eastern flank of NATO.  

What history teaches us

Defeat always carries with it structural changes when it comes to
regional and global power distribution. [For the past twenty years,
[Russia has been pursuing a revisionist policy]{.mark} with the goal of
[relitigating]{.mark} the end of [the Cold War.]{.mark} In the fields of
Ukraine, it has fought not just Kyiv, but every Western capital. In
fact, [Putin has stated outright that he is waging a civilizational war
against NATO and the West]{.mark}. Russia is now poised to score an
unequivocal civilizational victory, [the consequences of which will
reverberate]{.mark} not only in Europe, but also [in the **Middle
East**]{.mark}, the **[Korea]{.mark}**n Peninsula, [and]{.mark} in
**[the Indo-Pacific.]{.mark} ** ]{.underline}

[**[A "deal]{.mark}**]{.underline} on Ukraine" that in effect [[confirms
Russia's territorial gains]{.underline}]{.mark} and allows it to claim
the right to shape Ukraine's systemic transformation going forward---and
possibly even to absorb the country altogether down the line---will be
1991 in reverse, [[freeing Russia to leverage the new power
distribution]{.mark} and its alliance with China to its own
advantage.]{.underline} Add to this the strategic myopia of key European
politicians who, instead of recognizing what their weakness has wrought,
speak instead about "being abandoned by America," and you have the
perfect storm brewing just over the horizon.  

[**[Deterrence]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} both [about]{.mark} military
[capabilities and the willingness to use]{.mark} them. **[If you have
neither, the correct term is "appeasement]{.mark}**," with all that this
is likely to entail down the line. ]{.underline}

### Russian Arctic---revisionism

**China and Russia are revisionist aggressors in the Arctic---failure to
confront makes catastrophic war inevitable.**

The polar regions are changing, with projections of ice-free summers in
the Arctic and Antarctic by 2035 and 2060 respectively, meaning their
strategic value propositions are increasing.^2^ Neighboring [polar
powers are orienting their policies, postures, and military
capabilities]{.underline} toward each region because the current
international order looks increasingly orderless. [[**Absent military
confrontation**, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[will not
contain]{.mark}** the ambitions of [**China and Russia** in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} remote regions of the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Antarctica.
[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark} an adequate [[US
response]{.mark}]{.underline} (and coherent polar strategy), [**[China
and Russia will continue making gains]{.mark} in the polar
regions**,]{.underline} leading neighboring polar states to rebalance
their military postures and alliances to keep pace in the evolving polar
strategic competition.

As of 2021, the possibility of polar warfare with China and Russia
remains low. However, the problem of tomorrow should be the debate of
today, and [tomorrow's problem increasingly [looks like]{.mark}
competition and potential [**conflict** over the **polar
regions**]{.mark} rather than the false premise of preparing for a
**traditional war** in Eastern Europe or the South China
Sea]{.underline}. Thus, there needs to be an "American polar pivot" in
policy and strategy (and military capability) to counter and/or deter
malign actions by China and Russia in the Arctic and Antarctica.^3^

Compared with Russian Arctic military posture and Chinese Antarctic
orientation, America is militarily behind. With recent Russian military
and Chinese economic expansion, the Arctic is now en vogue for
international security scholars and practitioners.^4^ In 2019 President
Donald Trump, following in Harry Truman's footsteps, quipped of his
interest in purchasing Greenland. While the media mocked the president's
comments, they dismissed historic precedent and strategic implications:
Greenland has tremendous geopolitical and strategic value in shaping
future polar dynamics in the twenty-first century and beyond.^5^ The
Department of Defense claims the "immediate prospect of conflict in the
Arctic is low," but omits substantive discussion about Antarctica in its
defense and security posture. The Polar regions are among the least
understood strategic regions in the world, and the evidence supports
that assertion.

The US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) is the geographic combatant
command responsible for Antarctica. Despite this, its commander did not
mention Antarctica once in his 41-page March 2021 testimony to the House
Armed Services Committee.^6^ ADM Philip Davidson did, however, speak in
detail about Russian activity in the Arctic as among one of the
command's concerns, even though the USINDOPACOM area of responsibility
(AOR) does *not *extend into the Arctic Circle. The command's northern
boundary extends into the Bering Sea, thereby technically reaching the
Arctic Region according to the US legal definition of the Arctic but
hardly establishing itself as an Arctic-relevant command.^7^ The 11th
Air Force operates in the Arctic but does so under the operational
command of NORAD/NORTHCOM. The inconsistencies continue on the command's
website. As of this writing, the site's "About" section proclaims that
the USINDOPACOM AOR stretches "from Antarctica to the North
Pole."^8^ This is a patently false statement and is indicative of a
broader issue: the US defense establishment needs a geostrategic polar
education. The intrigue of polar conflict is generating discussion
marked by passionate arguments either sounding the alarm or quieting the
herd.^9^

This article contends that US policy makers should understand the
growing problem of suspicious Chinese and Russian actions in the polar
regions. The dangers of an uncontested China and Russia may lead to a
strategic imbalance in evolving regions of geostrategic and geopolitical
relevance. Thus, there should be focused policy solutions and military
capabilities dedicated toward ensuring that China and Russia do not
further challenge the status quo at the North Pole and South Pole.

The Polar Picture

Antarctica receives scant attention relative to the Arctic in
contemporary security affairs. The cold Arctic is a hot topic. Arguments
concerning potential Arctic conflict have adopted two competing
positions. The first group presents an *Arctic alarmist* narrative of
geopolitical and geostrategic interest warranting attention from the US
defense establishment to thwart the potential for Arctic
conflict.^10^ The second group presents an *Arctic apologist *narrative,
dismissing claims of strategic competition in the high north and
apologizing to the international community for the dangerous rhetoric.
Apologists promote Arctic apathy, believing that Arctic militarization
is sensationalist rhetoric absent any legitimate concern and that the
United States should abstain from engaging in Arctic militarization to
avoid conflict. Similar dynamics present when confronting the strategic
competition descending on Antarctica.

Given the divergence between the two intellectual camps and the
influence each has on future polar affairs, it is prudent to consider
their foundations and evolution. As we will see, each camp misses a
critical commonality in their predictive end states: Regardless of
whether the United States aggresses to or abstains from polar
militarization, competition is happening such that [**[confrontation is
inevitable]{.underline}**; [and **with** **confrontation** **comes**
**conflict**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A Thawing Polar Debate?

In terms of potential polar conflict stemming from strategic
competition, the Arctic takes center stage in academic and policy
debates. The arc of Arctic security literature swings from the bellicose
Arctic alarmist viewpoint to the nonbelligerent Arctic
apologist* *perspective, with the latter viewed as the dominant (and
preferred) position. Arctic apologists suggest that the United States
should not increase Arctic militarization and that any advocacy
otherwise is fearmongering and provocation or "poking the Russian
bear."^11^

*Arctic Apologists: Avoiding Confrontation*

The Arctic apologist camp points to various reasons why the United
States should refrain from power projection in the Arctic---such as
limited American icebreaker capabilities relative to China and Russia,
overstated geopolitical significance of the Arctic, and unneeded Arctic
economic resources---that all collectively amount to nonintervention.
Arctic apologists claim Arctic defense and security concerns unfounded
melodrama and further accuse Arctic alarmists' claims for Arctic
militarization as creating the caricature of a truly cold war with China
and Russia over polar bears and seals.

As US defense officials are gradually raising the Arctic profile, there
is a disquieting narrative to US Arctic policy promoting a restrained
approach. This camp contends that "there is no scramble for the Arctic"
and that the United States must resist temptation to expand its Arctic
military footprint---because doing so will give Russia an excuse to
escalate militarily.^12^ This narrative paints the Arctic as a
traditional "zone of peace," such that anything challenging that notion
injects irrational fear.^13^ This narrative holds that Russian Arctic
military expansion is innocuous and defensive, unworthy of international
attention, and hardly enough to compel US military posturing in
response. It views Russian Arctic militarization as a means for
protection and economic survival in the face of perceived rival
great-power expansionism in their own backyard. However, apologists
ignore the growing Russian military activity in the Arctic, resting
their assumptions on the supposedly normative notion of exceptional
peace inherent in the polar region, assuming it too taboo for conflict.
Ironically, these apologists anchor their position of a peaceful Arctic
to the debunked notion of Arctic exceptionalism.

In 2015, researchers at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs
examined the notion of Arctic exceptionalism: a "political vision . . .
\[with the Arctic\] as a 'zone of peace' and a 'territory of dialogue'
unlike any other region."^14^ Though the Finnish scholars concluded
Arctic exceptionalism as misguided, the idea of the Arctic as a remote
and peaceful domain devoid of conflict has become a dominating
narrative---in part because it is true. Whereas some scholarly articles
advanced this peaceful position in recent years, the Arctic apologist
normative narrative has gained the most popularity in the twenty-first
century.^15^

Arctic apologists have taken their positions and filled the pages of
online commentary, scholarly discourse, and even Twitter feeds with
them. Public platforms are ripe with articles warning against the perils
of Arctic militarization. Since 2015 alone, there are dozens of pieces
advancing this position. For instance, Pincus and Berbrick contend the
Arctic is not a top US geopolitical priority, encouraging nonmilitarized
strategic engagement.^16^ Similarly, Robert Murray claimed there was
"little to gain" for Russia if it were to engage in military conflict
with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in the Arctic.^17^ He
argues that Russian activities are a defensive effort to secure vital
Arctic economic interests and that ideas of confronting Russia only
provoke tension. Stephanie Pezard echoes similar sentiments about the
United States treading lightly in the Arctic to avoid unnecessary
militarization and competition.^18^ Pezard presents an apologist
framework for avoiding Arctic competition and conflict, with a warning
that "tit-for-tat dynamics \[in the Arctic between the United States and
Russia\] could lead to escalation."^19^

More recently, Rachael Gosnell contends that the Arctic Council has
sufficiently neutralized Arctic tensions for years as a stabilizing
institutional body, although Russia's 2018 exclusion from the Arctic
Security Forces Roundtable has raised the specter of hostility.^20^ Dave
Auerswald suggests the United States should "play the long game,"
contending that freedom of navigation operations in the Arctic with
insufficient capabilities are a waste of time.^21^ He contends that
there would be a bigger payoff to creating a global public narrative
that condemns Russia's Arctic actions rather than confronting the
Russian threat militarily. To this end, others such as Robert English
warn of the costs of getting involved in an "Arctic arms race," arguing
that doing so would be motivated by "threat inflation" and would likely
end similarly to one of America's past "foreign policy
blunders."^22^ This is not a comprehensive illustration of the
commentary denouncing Arctic militarization; rather, it is a mere
sampling of the evolving position arguing for a passive approach to
Arctic security that is---ironically---almost entirely reliant on
increasingly fragile international institutions, norms, and traditions
to maintain Arctic stability. There is even an evolving phenomenon in
which Arctic apologists mock Arctic alarmists through dismissive and
satirical writing, a scholarly positional harrying that seeks to
discredit references to the Arctic as a potential geostrategic zone of
competition and conflict.^23^

Dozens of articles circulate with similar apologist positions advancing
Arctic pacifism. Despite the Department of Defense's 2019 *Arctic
Strategy* (as well as the Air Force, Army, and Navy strategies of the
same tone) calling for increased Arctic awareness, enhanced Arctic
operations, and rules-based order in the Arctic, the apologist narrative
has been mainstreamed as a default US Arctic policy
position.^24^ Whereas online commentary is littered with utopian
arguments assuming geopolitical centrism and calling for a restrained
approach to Arctic security reliant on institutional liberalism and
diplomacy, there is comparably little peer-reviewed academic scholarship
that does the same. The dominant position in online commentary views the
Arctic as an insignificant, unwinnable, and low-threat region, but
others in both online and scholarly mediums argue the opposite and
expect the Arctic---and its polar counterpart Antarctica---to be among
the most important geopolitical and geostrategic hot spots that shape
competition among the great powers in the twenty-first century and
beyond.

*Arctic Alarmists: Leverage Through Strength*

Those arguing for greater American involvement in the Arctic note
expanding Russian military infrastructure and Chinese economic interests
for trade routes as ways the power balance can shift out of US favor
absent corresponding orientation and posturing. According to this camp,
Moscow's and Beijing's efforts indicate deliberate attempts to
outmaneuver the United States in the Arctic. Russia, under Vladimir
Putin, counters America by engaging in political information warfare
against the West. Moreover, US officials believe Russia is violating
international treaties by virtue of testing low-yield nuclear weapons at
an Arctic site in the Novaya Zemlya Islands.^25^ China, under Xi
Jinping, is also undermining America and the West. Chinese nuclear
icebreakers will likely support the clearing of maritime channels for an
evolving Chinese commercial industry and trade routes. However, since
the economy is under the Chinese Communist Party, China will likely use
its icebreakers in support of shrouded military objectives. Thus, future
Chinese icebreaking and so-called commercial traffic might be a guise
for positioning military assets in the Arctic, similar to the Chinese
use of commercial fishing vessels in the South China Sea to veil
military activity. With these and other activities in mind, Arctic
alarmists point to many significant geopolitical and geostrategic
indicators in their lobbying for Arctic importance.

Arctic security discourse tends toward climate discussions---identifying
the Arctic as the pinnacle domain effected by anthropogenic changes to
the earth's atmosphere. Since 2011, there have been four Arctic-focused
edited volumes examining northern geopolitics, security, and climate
change.^26^ Though each book rebukes notions of Arctic tensions, the
prevailing position contends that the Arctic is a complex domain of
great-power rivalry and competition spurred by environmental changes and
increased access. Each text is layered with content discussing the
precarious position of international laws, institutions, and norms as
they seek to collectively bind Arctic actors to a codified list of
acceptable activities within a unique global commons returning to
relevancy thanks to the twenty-first century surge for resources.
Whereas some observers outline the evolving nature of Arctic
militarization as reality---despite the Arctic's long-enjoyed
designation as an international zone of peace---they acknowledge
Russia's and China's advances but stop short of advocating similar
advances for the United States.^27^ While many scholars acknowledge the
realities of renewed Arctic tensions, few extend their arguments to
suggest deliberate Artic militarization.

Despite this prevailing hesitancy, scholars grapple with observable
realities leading to the conclusion that the Arctic is no longer
exceptional or a zone of peace. But just as they contend with Arctic
security issues in myriad ways, they also---with some exceptions---hold
a predominantly optimistic outlook and advocate change and improvement
to stave off future Arctic tensions and resulting conflict. Owing to
their optimism, these scholars are better labeled Arctic "advocates"
than they are "alarmists," as they seek improvement by advancing the
dialogue in constructive ways without blindly clinging to dated notions
of Arctic stability.

Those who contribute to the discourse still see great-power economic
interests and initiatives as conflict avoidance mechanisms but
acknowledge that these interests can just as easily become points of
future contention if mismanaged.^28^ They acknowledge the trillions of
dollars of untapped natural resources---ripe for exploitation by capable
actors---as a major motivator for further Arctic undertakings.^29^ But
where the Arctic advocates stop and separate from Arctic alarmists is in
their understanding of great-power activities and the underlying intent
driving them.

The Arctic alarmists perceive Russian Arctic expansionist indicators as
displaying similar intent to the 2014 annexation of Crimea while
likewise extending China's actions in the South China Sea as a
predictive analog for *their* Arctic intent. Some scholars dispute the
"South China Sea as a precursor to the Arctic" argument and further
question the existence of a Russo-Sino alliance.^30^ Noting
Russia--China tensions, Arctic alarmists insist that Russia and China
exhibit *bandwagoning* behaviors and seek to supplant the United States
as the global hegemon, perceiving the Arctic as an opportunistic avenue
to do so. For Arctic alarmists, establishing a military foothold now,
consistent with the US Air Force's 2020 *Arctic Strategy*, calls for an
expanded infrastructure base in addition to power projection, vigilance,
deterrence through cooperation, and cold-weather preparation.^31^ Arctic
alarmists remind us that Russia operates nuclear-powered submarines in
the Arctic, has dozens of military facilities in its Arctic territory,
maintains a dedicated Arctic military command, and flies bomber sorties
throughout the Arctic regularly. Russia is already years ahead of the
United States in the Arctic.

To alarmists, Russian military efforts are a precursor to controlling
the high north, challenging American command of the commons, asserting
influence, and even holding the US homeland at risk. Already, Russian
military capabilities threaten the American homeland due to their
unstoppable hypersonic ballistic missiles based in the Arctic.^32^ In
the words of former US Northern Command Commander General Terrance
O'Shaughnessy: "The Homeland is not a sanctuary" the way it once
was.^33^

Scholars will continue to debate whether the Arctic matters for the
United States such that it should compel military involvement. There
will continue to be disputes over Chinese and Russian Arctic ambition
relative to American interests. These discussions will grapple with
whether Russia aggressively seeks offensive expansion or merely
defensive security for its northern territories. Others will contend
with whether China---as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---actually
desires Arctic influence via its Polar Silk Road (part of China's major
economic Belt and Road \[BRI\] initiative) or merely seeks to advance
its own economic position via access to Arctic resources and alternative
shipping lanes connecting Asia and Europe.^34^ We will continue reading
about Russian icebreakers outnumbering American icebreaker capabilities
20-to-1, or even 40-to-1---the so-called icebreaker gap---and what the
United States should (or should not) do about such a capability
imbalance.^35^ Moreover, Arctic alarmists will point to the continued
Russian military buildup of Arctic infrastructure, the questionably
legal control Russia claims over the Northern Sea Route, and the 2014
establishment of the Northern Fleet and its Arctic focus---coupled with
Moscow's planning and execution of thousands of Arctic exercises and
infrastructure modernization efforts---as points of attention for the
evolving Arctic significance.^ 36^

For this side, Moscow's economic and military commitment to the Arctic
indicates significant interest and intent such that the United States
must not dismiss it as irrelevant to future international security,
especially considering the United States is an Arctic state with a
national coastline on Arctic shores. We must reject the false notion of
Arctic exceptionalism regarding the great-power competition of the
twenty-first century. Instead, we need to adopt the notion of *Arctic
essentialism* that sees the Arctic for its value in the international
security chess game, not for the utopic zone of peace we hope it will
be.

*Focusing the Arctic Debate on Harsh Realities of Military Power*

The Arctic is the only coastal region of the United States with an
active strategic competitor conducting regular military activity off the
coast, and yet northern air defenses are obsolete. The North Warning
System (NWS) is an aging northern-tier radar array spread across Alaska
and Canada meant to identify incoming missile threats. The NWS relies on
1980s technology and needs to be replaced.^37^ This twentieth-century
system is incapable of providing sufficient warning to defend against
modern Russian air- and sea-launched cruise missiles able to strike
North American targets from beyond existing radar coverage. The Russian
hypersonic missile threat presents an objective capability that the
United States cannot overcome.

Hypersonic missiles keep US planners up at night. These are dual-threat
weapons combining the flight-path maneuverability of guided cruise
missiles with the speed of ballistic missiles. They can be used in two
ways: as a hypersonic cruise missile propelled by a hydrogen propulsion
air-breathing engine, or as a hypersonic glide vehicle launched via a
rocket before detaching to glide to its target. Irrespective of delivery
method, hypersonic projectiles can accelerate several times faster than
the speed of sound and are able to maneuver across thousands of miles in
minutes, enabling them to negate modern missile defense systems. Further
compounding the threat, hypersonic missiles can be launched from
land-based mobile rocket launchers or fighter aircraft, can carry
conventional or nuclear warheads, and maintain precision strike accuracy
to within 10--20 meters of its target (though Russia claims within a
meter).^38^ The United States has no publicly revealed capability to
reliably defend against hypersonic missiles. While some warn against
buying into the hypersonic hype and contend the threat is embellished,
the United States cannot take that risk. As such, Russia's deployments
of hypersonic weapon systems to the Arctic should give US officials
reason for concern.

In December 2019, Russia confirmed the deployment of the hypersonic
Kinzhal (Russian for "dagger") air-launched ballistic missile to the
Arctic.^39^ The aptly named Kinzhal can be launched from Russian fighter
aircraft with a conventional or nuclear warhead traveling more than
7,600 miles per hour and strike targets 1,200 miles away with precision
accuracy. Another recently deployed Russian hypersonic weapon, the
Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, reportedly travels 20--27 times the
speed of sound (15,000--20,000 mph) and can strike targets up to 3,700
miles away.^40^ But Russia hardly needs this range to reach the United
States

Russia has an air and naval base on Wrangel Island, about 300 miles from
the Alaskan coastline on the western edge of the Chukchi
Sea.^41^ However, such close proximity is almost irrelevant with
maneuverable land- or air-launched hypersonic missiles capable of
traversing the Arctic Ocean to strike a target with nuclear warheads
from more than 3,000 miles away in less than 10 minutes. At these
standoff ranges, much of Alaska is within range of Russian Avangards if
they were launched from any of the dozens of Russian military bases
north of the Arctic Circle. These are---as Russia
claims---unstoppable missiles that both Russia and China possess; the
United States has neither a close analog nor the technology to
sufficiently defend against them.

According to General O'Shaughnessy, Russian hypersonic missiles can
"strike Alaska with little indication or warning."^42^ The NWS is more
than 30 years old and incapable of effectively tracking and warning
against modern hypersonic missiles. To establish a good defense, the
United States is pursuing answers to this tangible threat in the Arctic
via its efforts to develop the Strategic Homeland Integrated Ecosystem
Layered Defense (SHIELD), a system designed to detect and defeat
threats to the United States. The problem is that SHIELD, while a
fancifully named defense, is a long way from operational reality.^43^ In
the absence of a good defense against advancing adversaries in the
Arctic, the United States needs a good offense in the surface domain to
forestall these formidable systems. This security problem is only
compounded by the fact that the situation is no better in the maritime
domain.

Beyond the inadequacy of the NWS relative to modern Russian surface
strike capabilities, Russia's new submarines are quieter and more
difficult for US undersea surveillance capabilities to reliably track
and predict. Russian submarines can effectively maneuver undetected
throughout the Arctic Ocean.^44^ US naval presence in the Arctic
provides a "fundamental security confidence" for US power projection,
but US naval capabilities are equally inadequate when it comes to polar
operations relative to Russia and China.^45^

As Russian capabilities advance both in speed and distance, the vast
Arctic---as a new "battlespace"---begins to compress.^46^ Battlespace
compression leads to reduced reactions times and---given US reliance on
twentieth-century technology---an inability to defend the US homeland
against a modernized Russian Arctic force capable of exploiting US
complacency in future strategic competition. The Pentagon insists that
the 2019 *Arctic Strategy* is rooted in and informed by the
2017 *National Security Strategy* (*NSS*) and 2018 *National Defense
Strategy*. The first pillar of the 2017 *NSS* is to "protect the
American people, the homeland, and the American way of life," and the
first secondary pillar of this priority focus is to secure US borders
and territory. Despite this charge, the United States cannot meet this
intent on its northern Arctic border operating under the current
technological disparity. This is a critical vulnerability, and the most
recent 2021 *Interim National Security Strategic Guidance*, issued by
the Joseph Biden administration, omits any reference to the Arctic and
Antarctica.

Russian capabilities coupled with Chinese nuclear icebreakers and polar
flying squadrons have collectively established a polar offset with
greater polar military capabilities compared with those of America.
Measuring and understanding intent is difficult to quantify and
interpret, so predicting future conflict is equally challenging.
However, the Artic alarmist argument looks at objective indicators of
the polar power policies and activities in the poles coupled with the
changing geography and corresponding geopolitical environment to inform
its collective position that the Arctic is now---or soon will be---an
arena for great-power conflict. To this end, interpreting Arctic actions
by strategic competitors is just as important as understanding their
similar behavior patterns in Antarctica.^47^

The South Pole Blind Spot

Polar geopolitics with an eye toward defense and security
affairs---inclusive of both the Arctic and Antarctica---is not a topic
of regular debate among academics and practitioners. Few have questioned
how the polar regions collectively will evolve as geopolitical and
geostrategic inflection points of competition. What are the strategic
implications for Arctic competition relative to Antarctica?

Whereas Arctic security is now a regular discussion point, Antarctic
dialogue generally assumes that the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) will
assure indefinite peace.^48^ The Antarctic Treaty of 1959---and its
complementary agreements forming the ATS---is the primary regulatory
framework for Antarctic activity. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits
military maneuvers and specifies that military assets can be used only
for assisting scientific research, logistics, and search-and-rescue
missions. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty (the Madrid Protocol), signed in 1998, designates Antarctica as a
"natural reserve devoted to peace and science."^49^ Thus, Antarctica has
been---save for a handful of singular incidents mentioned
above---entirely demilitarized since the treaty entered into force in
1961.^50^

Despite the Antarctic Treaty's restrictions on militarization, Chinese
and Russian actions elsewhere indicate their willingness to deviate from
international laws, rules, and norms. Some scholars and policy makers
remain committed to the assumption that China and Russia will respect
international institutions, despite numerous contradictory
examples.^51^ Currently, Chinese actions in Antarctica blur the lines
between military operations and research. Just as the Chinese expand
their "civilian research presence"^ ^in the Arctic as an apparent veil
for enabling a future military presence tied to economic interests, they
likewise appear to be pursuing a similar approach in Antarctica through
expanding capabilities and infrastructure projects including research
stations, airstrip construction, and the creation of a dedicated
Antarctic air squadron in 2016.^52^

According to Anne-Marie Brady, China is "keeping other states guessing
about its true intentions and interests" in Antarctica.^53^ Brady and
others perceive China's increased Antarctic activity---now totaling 36
Antarctic expeditions and counting---as posturing for exploitation after
the Madrid Protocol enters a period for renegotiation in 2048, or
perhaps earlier if the Antarctic Treaty is abandoned.^54^ To this point,
speaking at the Mitchell Institute in 2019, US Air Force general Charles
Brown recounted an incident in which a Chinese icebreaker experienced
mechanical issues in the Antarctic region and, instead of traveling to
New Zealand (the closest port of repair), suspiciously traveled direct
to China. "Coincidence? Makes me a little suspect," General Brown
stated.^55^ In the context of strategic competition and the potential
for future conflict, Chinese and Russian motives must be reexamined.

Chinese military ambition is global in nature and underpinned by China's
BRI efforts. Beijing has invested (or attempted investments) in
Greenland, Iceland, Canada, Nicaragua, sub-Saharan Africa, the South and
East China Seas, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and other
areas to form the linked network for the BRI as the primary vehicle for
advancing its global hegemonic ambitions.^56^ Antarctica is no
exception. Considering these and other Chinese actions, we should not be
surprised that General Brown publicly states the Antarctic is "just a
number of years away" from a great-power competition similar to the
Arctic.^57^

Though Antarctica does not rival the Arctic in geographic relevance or
economic importance to the United States, continued omission of
Antarctica from the strategic competition narrative further enables
Chinese exploitation of the ambiguities present in international
agreements. As an example, the US State Department's 2019 *Indo-Pacific
Vision* cover page has a map of the region, which excludes Antarctica,
and rest of the document's 32 pages have no mention of the continent in
any context.^58^ These are subtly significant indicators of US Antarctic
indifference, providing exploitative motivations for strategic
competitors like Russia and China. Moreover, China increasingly views
itself as a polar power.^59^ The United States is not a near-Antarctic
power by geographical standards, but by virtue of being a hegemon and
defender of the commons it is a de facto near-Antarctic power.^60^

There is too much at stake in the era of renewed strategic competition
and the evolution of space as a future conflict domain for Antarctica to
remain Washington's strategic blind spot. The United States must
strengthen its partnerships with New Zealand and Australia (and other
near-Antarctic partners) as gateway countries for Antarctic access. The
continued use of Christchurch International Airport to fly annual
Operation Deep Freeze missions in support of the US Antarctic Program
warrants bolstered support.^61^ Scholars and policy makers must address
Antarctica in future debates and include it in strategic discussions on
polar defense and security, precisely because the future of American
space power and operations is dependent on communication infrastructure
in the polar regions.

Besides excluding Antarctica from the polar picture, the debate is
superficial and devoid of historical context and theoretical
considerations as predictors of future action. The discussion over true
Russian and Chinese intent in the polar regions is ambiguous, and
ambiguity begets speculation. With speculation saturating public
commentary, the discourse continues to overlook the lessons of history.
What about the evolving polar-region dynamic parallels history? And what
can we learn to offer a glimpse into the future of potential polar
conflict? In terms of strategic competition and conflict, history must
be included to form a comprehensive predictive narrative influencing
future policy and strategy. Policy that informs strategy toward
particular ends is best informed by an understanding of the relevant
history shaping the current environment. For the polar regions, history
runs deep.

History and Context

Since the early twentieth century, the United States and many other
nations have conducted polar military operations and military-supported
scientific expeditions. As more countries arrived in the polar regions,
the need for international cooperation mechanisms grew. Both the
Antarctic Treaty and the Arctic Council were designed as solutions to
resolve polar tensions, with many holding these cooperative institutions
in high regard. Yet, these supposedly effective institutions are seldom
discussed in contemporary policy circles, as they both lack effective
enforcement mechanisms. Historical antecedents are often useful points
of departure such that we cannot afford to continue overlooking relevant
history and theory in debates about future strategic competition in the
Arctic and Antarctica. History provides insights on how command of the
commons is at stake in the polar regions and how disagreement over who
commands the commons is a reliable predictor of confrontation and
eventual conflict.

From the seventeenth century to the early twentieth, the British
controlled the maritime commons. Because they controlled the commons,
they controlled the seas. Those who most control and influence a domain
make the rules. China and Russia are attempting to establish polar
dominance via their respective polar pivots. Polar presence will promote
influence, which will lead to economic gain and increased global power
sufficient to destabilize, potentially, the international system to the
detriment of the West. Hegemonic stability theory holds that the world
order is most stable under unipolarity with a single global hegemon. So,
a Chinese or Russian challenge to American command of the commons---via
related challenges to or departures from the existing polar claims and
international covenants---will have certain destabilizing
effects.^62^ Consider the tenets of the so-called long cycle theory:
since the fifteenth century, hegemonic power transitions tend to occur,
on average, every 75 years. It has been more than 75 years since the
United States first assumed its status as the world leader. If history
is any indicator, the United States is primed for challenge to its
hegemony.^63^

[There are]{.underline} numerous [[warning signs of]{.mark} rising
powers asserting regional hegemonic [ambition in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Antarctica. The budding Chinese and
Russian "strategic partnership,"^64^ [[a **revisionist Russia**]{.mark}
relapsing to Cold War--era aggression]{.underline} and rhetoric, and
China's antagonistic global expansionism combined with known and
demonstrated Polar interests, activities, and investments demonstrate
commitment to change. Revisionist states have explicitly undermined US
interests since at least 2010 such that [their ambitions cannot be
dismissed as innocuous or inconsequential]{.underline}. The polar
regions are opportunistic targets of low-risk, high-payoff expansion for
China and Russia given the relative lack of American polar presence and
policy commitment.

Strategic competition is on the rise, and [the [**ingredients**
**for**]{.mark} international **confrontation** and eventual
[**conflict** are **brewing**.]{.mark} The **polar regions**, more than
any other, pose the greatest threat to current American
hegemony]{.underline}. [Two rising powers are challenging the current

Graham Allison's descriptive problem of the **Thucydides Trap**, that
when these conditions are present, the]{.underline} [**potential for
conflict increases**.]{.underline} In this way, there are indications
abound suggesting that [we are progressing toward]{.underline} the
realization of [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar **[[Polar
Trap.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

*The Polar Trap*

Considering Chinese and Russian policies and actions, the polar regions
are becoming easy power grabs. Whereas the United States stands as the
current global hegemon, or the ruling power in historical narrative,
[increased activities by **China and Russia** in the polar
regions]{.underline}---coupled with American strategic dithering
elsewhere in the world---[contribute to the necessary preconditions for
realization of the Thucydides Trap.]{.underline} Coined by Graham
Allison in 2015, [the concept suggests that **[when]{.mark}**ever the
rise of [an]{.mark} **[ambitious power]{.mark}** [threatens to dethrone
the]{.mark} existence of a [current hegemon, the]{.mark} likely
**[result is war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}^65^

According to Allison, 12 of the 16 recorded cases of a rising power
threatening a ruling one in the past 500 years resulted in
war.^66^ Some, such as Jonathan Kirshner openly, question Allison's
assumptions and arguments, chiefly that his case-selection bias supports
his theory *and* that the four cases where war did not
result *all* occurred after 1945 where nuclear weapons changed the
calculus behind great-power wars.^67^ Still, there is empirical validity
to the concept that provides utility in applying it to a lesser-known
region. In this way, we generate a template for understanding future
polar power competition and predicting a potential Polar Trap under
similar circumstances.^68^

The Thucydides Trap is illustrative of a security dilemma when a ruling
power proactively confronts a rising power militarily over a contested
domain, thereby leading to greater militarization and raising the
potential for conflict. In each of Allison's cases, he identifies the
period in which the conflict occurs, a ruling power, a rising power, a
contested domain, and a binary outcome of war or no war. Using this
framework, there are similarities to the evolving situation in the polar
regions. Whereas the rise of Athens supposedly threatened Sparta and
catalyzed war, continued tensions stemming from Russian and Chinese
presence in the polar regions will likewise undermine American hegemony.
Increased military activities by rival competitors will continue
producing the conditions for confrontation.

*Conditions for the Polar Trap*

Allison's theory stems from his interpretation of Thucydides's writings
in the *History of the Peloponnesian War.*^69^* *According to Allison,
Thucydides focused on the shift in the balance of power between Athens
and Sparta as the basis for their eventual conflict. Allison contends
Thucydides specified two primary drivers of the dynamic leading to the
trap: (1) the burgeoning *entitlement*, sense of *importance*, and
demand for *influence *by the rising power, coupled directly with (2)
the rising power's *fear *and *insecurity*.^70^ When a rising power
demonstrated each of these attributes, Allison and his research team
found that they challenged---in some way---the ruling power of the time.
Though Allison's team limited its study to 16 cases, 75 percent of the
historical cases meeting these criteria resulted in war.^71^ The team
further identified two cases in which the United States was the ruling
power and simultaneously threatened by at least one rising power: World
War II and the Cold War.

In general, the international order maintains stability when states are
satisfied with the order and thus adopt an orientation to preserve the
status quo. Threats to the international order tend to come from
dissatisfied states seeking to gain more territory, better status, or
different rules. Dissatisfied states, then, adopt revisionist agendas
and increasingly "mount challenges against the hegemon and its order"
whenever the hegemon fails to accommodate their interests or actively
seeks to restrict them.^72^ In this way, the circumstances of World War
II are notably similar to twenty-first century great-power competition.

In World War II, the United States faced the Axis Powers: the German,
Italian, and Japanese alliance intent on upending Western democratic
norms. In today's competitive environment, Russia and China demonstrate
similar motivations. Is Russia or China baiting the United States toward
conflict with one so that the other can rise to power? The nuclear
tensions and military posturing of the Cold War are similar to today's
contemporary security environment in that the presence of nuclear
weapons alone seems to prevent large-scale military conflict for fear of
irrecoverable escalation into nuclear warfare.

Whereas the existence of nuclear weapons continues to serve as a mutual
deterrent, great-power conflict is not a figment of twenty-first century
imagination. Rather, an emerging body of scholarship suggests that
great-power conflict can "unravel without anyone ever firing a
shot."^73^ History tells us that during periods of hegemonic transition,
the hegemon faces increasing difficulties in maintaining its preferred
international order; its relative decline encourages other states
unhappy with that order to seek to renegotiate terms, build alternative
arrangements of one kind or another, probe for weaknesses, and even
directly challenge the dominant power or its allies. [[In the
worst-case]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}, peaceful adjustment to the
changing distribution of military and economic capabilities proves
impossible; as it did in World War I and World War II, the system
collapses into a devastating **[[great-power
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.^74^

After 75 years of hegemony, the United States today is dealing with a
revisionist Russia and rising China. History is not on Washington's side
at the moment. Moscow and Beijing are working to build alternative
global structures that alter the American-led status quo. Each continues
prodding for US vulnerabilities, carried out via sharp power campaigns
meant to undermine US domestic and US-led international institutions.
China and Russia are actively pursuing military and economic influence
efforts in the polar regions, as a perceived weakness to US primacy.
With weakening status, Cooley and Nexon argue American hegemony can fall
via three main mechanisms, or "pathways of change": *great-power
challenges*, *changing small and weak state behaviors*,
and *transnational contention*. There is evidence of each occurring in
the contemporary international security environment.

*Polar Pathways of Change*

In terms of *great-power challenges*, (i.e., direct contestation from
competing peer or near-peer states), the United States faces increasing
challenges from both Russia and China spanning economic, diplomatic, and
informational strategies. Military challenges remain distanced and
indirect, but confrontations between US forces versus Russian and
Chinese forces are becoming more frequent in the Arctic and the South
China Sea, respectively. China's ascent to international influence has
also led to notable *changes in small and weak state behaviors*. As an
example, 18 of the 30 NATO member states currently have a signed
memorandum of understanding to economically partner with China's
BRI.^75^ NATO states with ties to the BRI are predominantly among those
considered weakest within the NATO alliance, furthering Cooley and
Nexon's notion of changing small and weak state behaviors as a precursor
to US hegemonic unraveling. What does China's BRI and its connection to
the weak states within the NATO alliance say about NATO's future
stability?

According to Cooley and Nexon, *transnationalism* entails the
destabilization of previously held norms and foreign policy frameworks.
They further contend that rising powers wishing to contest the ruling
power and the established order adopt "wedge" strategies to dissolve the
fabric of the order and its structure.^76^ Hegemons such as the United
States provide a collective security proposition to weaker states,
incentivizing allegiance absent a better alternative. This proposition
provides a security blanket (i.e., subsidy) to small states lacking
strong economies to build and maintain organically powerful militaries
sufficient for their own security.

When economic powers such as China enter the fray and offer financial
incentives to small states, it can be a compelling and competing value
proposition that strains existing alliances. In a form of realpolitik,
if a powerful state can offer sufficient incentive for a weaker state to
question the value of its existing security blanket and ideologies, this
threatens to unravel the threads of ideologically sewn alliances. With
most NATO states economically partnered with China---a country the
United States now labels as its "greatest potential adversary"---a
question is raised about NATO's legitimacy as an alliance durable enough
to withstand Beijing's economic wedge-driving.^77^

Consider as well that many of the current international institutions
serving as the "connective tissue" of the contemporary international
order were established during the US unipolar movement.^78^ These
longstanding US-led institutions are at risk of dissolving at worst or
repurposing and reorganizing at best. From 2017--2020, the Trump
administration governed on an "America First" platform that openly
denounced the value of and need for multilateralism, international
organizations, alliances, and liberal values in general, viewing such
arrangements as a "threat to American power."^79^ As the United States
backed further away from international institutions under the Trump
administration, questioned alliances and partnerships, and generally
condemned the international community for collectively freeriding on the
back of the US economy, Washington gave away its formal and informal
position as hegemon---giving China an opening to make numerous
peripheral gains at the expense of the West.

*Chinese Conditions*

In developing his theory, Allison focused on China as a rising power
intent on challenging the United States as the current ruling power. To
this end, Allison notes that Lee Kuan Yew---who Allison calls the
"world's premier China watcher"---predicted that [[**China's ambition**
is]{.mark} unquestionably **[global
hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^80^ Adding to this, Chinese president
[**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping [has **stated**]{.mark} on numerous occasions
his **unambiguous i[ntent to change the world order]{.mark}** by putting
China on the path to "global eminence.]{.underline}"^81^ [China's
growing sense of self-importance and global ambition are
robust.]{.underline} [**[Few doubt Chinese intentions of unseating the
U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates as the dominant global
superpower]{.underline}. Worse, [[**China has developed** a
"**grievance-fueled sense of entitlement**]{.mark}," [**demonstrated**
in]{.mark} the ongoing [**territorial disputes** in the **South** and
**East China Seas**]{.mark}.^82^]{.underline}

We should consider Beijing's behavior here and in other areas as
indicators of broadening---and largely unchecked---ambition. The United
States is the only nation capable of counterbalancing Beijing's
ambition. However, China is leapfrogging US containment efforts and is
on track to challenge American hegemony by trying to secure its own
ports and airfields across the South Pacific.^83^ Whereas the United
States maintains more than 800 bases or installations worldwide, its
polar-region presence is comparably nonexistent.^84^ Beijing knows
this---and it is exploiting this American strategic oversight.

Absent military presence and strategic orientation to the north and
south, the United States is unable to influence these areas the way it
can elsewhere. Without a power to balance against at the ends of the
earth, Beijing began its own polar pivot in 2017. [China's
self-proclaimed status as a "near-Arctic state" illustrates
entitlement]{.underline} despite the fact that no such recognition
exists.^85^ A "near-Antarctic state" view of China is also fostered
domestically in China by sending the second-most number of tourists to
Antarctica of any country, thereby familiarizing its citizens with the
continent and [creating a narrative of China's destiny to manage the
future of Antarctic control]{.underline}.^86^

In further attempts to advance its polar influence, [**[China's Polar
Silk Road]{.mark}** policy [broadens its ambition to assert
power]{.mark} and influence over the polar regions]{.underline}. China's
Yellow River Research Station in Svalbard is among its most prized polar
achievements. To the south, its newly developed Antarctic air squadron
serves a research mission similar to that of the US Air Force logistics
support of the National Science Foundation, yet questions remain about
the nature of such activities due to ongoing Chinese efforts to conceal
Chinese Antarctic operations.^87^

Since Australia and New Zealand are members of the American-led "Five
Eyes Alliance," Beijing knows that, in a crisis, neither country would
support Chinese operations in Antarctica. Thus, China appears to be
laying the groundwork for supporting Antarctic operations via
infrastructure projects in the South Pacific near New Zealand and Papua
New Guinea. Beijing is building a port facility
and---presumably---military infrastructure at Luganville Wharf in
Vanuatu, a small, underdeveloped island nation only 1,000 miles north of
New Zealand, to the concern of Australian leaders.^88^ Similarly, China
inked a deal with Papua New Guinea to build a "comprehensive
multifunctional fishery industrial park" on Daru, a small island
community just off the country's southern coast and about 125 miles
north of Australia.^89^ This deal gives Beijing proximal access to
northern Australia and Port Darwin, where Beijing has a long-term port
lease that has deterred the US Navy and Marine Corps from establishing
its own infrastructure.^90^ The implications extend beyond Beijing's
apparent attempts at driving a wedge between Australia and the US
military's attempts at securing regional presence.

Daru Island sits approximately 4,100 miles south of China's Port of
Shanghai---the world's largest container port---via maritime route.
Hardly a coincidence, Daru Island is about 4,000 miles north via
maritime route of China's newest Antarctic research station on
Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea---China's closest
station to the US McMurdo Station on Ross Island.^91^ On Daru Island,
China gains dual-use (commercial and military) infrastructure at an
equidistant location between its largest mainland port and its newest
Antarctic research station while also securing a location that puts it
in close proximity to its Darwin port and the geographic focal point of
the US Navy and Marine Corps in the region. For context, we must couple
these geostrategic moves with American military commanders' concerns
with China's unwillingness to allow unfettered Consultative Party
inspections of their five Antarctic research stations, per Article VII
of the ATS.^92^ [Continued **[Chinese secrecy in
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Antarctic activities [[lends]{.mark}
further [weight to the argument that **Beijing's polar ambition is
malign**]{.mark}---and that institutions meant to keep both regions
peaceful are failing to enforce basic rules.]{.underline}

Those who continue to dismiss the rise of China as a threat to the
United States and international norms are not paying attention. The
Chinese economy is expanding to outcompete the United States in numerous
indices (depending on one's measure of economic strength).^ 93^ In terms
of gross domestic product, China's meteoric ascent since the 1980s shows
no signs of leveling off. Yes, using GDP as the basis of assessing
China's economic strength is unidimensional in that it measures only
production and ignores costs or consumption rates, but it is nonetheless
a global indicator of a state's economic productivity. Some will argue
that China---due to its enormous population and consumption needs---is
an inefficient economy in terms of its net indicators (or, more
generally, its productivity minus its costs).^94^ Whereas China's GDP
makes it the second-most powerful country in the world by that sole
indicator, if we consider its net indicators inclusive of its
productivity minus costs, Beijing's strength is far less impressive.

To this end, others contend that China is not a threat because of its
fragile economy, that the significance of its global influence is
overstated based on flawed logic, ignorant to the realities of
unquenchable resource consumption needs. [However, this position
unwittingly advances the argument establishing China's insecurity and
increasing ambition. **[Despite]{.mark}** growing **[economic
power]{.mark}** by way of productive measures, **China shows signs of
[insecurity]{.mark}** [and **fear**]{.mark} **of continued American
hegemony** and [an **inability to satisfy its resource need**s
under]{.mark} the continued **unipolar [American-led world
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China seeks to enhance its global power
position based on a "power-as-resources" strategy, circumventing
international institutions in the polar regions and elsewhere to serve
as potential cornerstones to securing resources to satisfy this
thirst.^95^

China is demonstrating strategic ambitions of challenging American
hegemony. To meet its power-as-resources goal, Beijing's ambitious,
entitled, self-righteous government and military pursue global influence
via international infrastructure investments to stay relevant on the
global stage. China's approach to global influence through
infrastructure investments and debt-trap diplomacy creates new spaces of
power. Chinese actions have met the necessary preconditions for
realization of the Thucydides Trap. While this so-called trap is an
abstract academic conceptualization, we should consider its
applicability to the polar regions.

*Russian Conditions*

While the Chinese only recently developed polar policies and military
capabilities, Russia began its own polar pivot in 2001. It began with
Russia filing the first of three unsuccessful (to date) territorial
shelf claims to the United Nations seeking to extend its exclusive
economic rights from the coast to the North Pole.^96^ In 2007, Russia
demonstrated its Arctic capability and intent by symbolically planting
its flag on the geographic North Pole Arctic seabed.^97^ Such Russian
symbolism extends to Antarctica as well. In 2004, Russia built an
Orthodox church at one of its Antarctic research stations. As a
year-round operation, the church holds services for Russian researchers
and is a visible demonstration of Moscow's sustainable presence and
influence on the continent.^98^ These self-important efforts have
dovetailed with expanded military infrastructure projects in the Arctic,
hostile actions in Georgia and Ukraine, and disingenuous claims that
American military forces deployed to the Baltics are a threat to Russian
sovereignty.^99^

In raising concerns about US actions, Russia feeds the narrative that
the United States is a global bully. President Putin's continued
anti-Western rhetoric advances the argument that Russia seeks
alternative institutional structures whereby the United States no longer
serves as the default leader in geopolitical affairs and where Moscow
enjoys status as a regional hegemon over Eurasia and the Arctic.

Russian sense of entitlement and self-importance mirrors that of the
Chinese, but [[given]{.mark} **geographic [proximity]{.mark}**,
**coastal access**, [and **economic importance**]{.mark}, **[Russian
ambitions are focused in the Arctic]{.mark}** rather than seeking
**global eminence**]{.underline}. [Moscow's aggressive
posture]{.underline} toward the Northern Sea Route and threats to use
military force against ships refusing to meet Russian requirements
[indicate its intent to control]{.underline} what it believes is legally
Russia's---what Russia is *entitled* to control.^100^ Such actions are a
direct challenge to freedom of navigation and Washington's desire to
command the commons toward this end, but Moscow pursues its agenda with
supposed economic intent.

Approximately 20 percent of the Russian economy is dependent on the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** located there
[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} enduring [interest for Russia to continue
its contested claims to the high north]{.underline}. With the Russian
economy tied the "primordial homeland," the Arctic is [a vital national
interest]{.underline}. Considering Russian economic dependence on
natural resources, this Arctic interest is one of survival as Moscow
seeks alternative means to support the economy and declining population.
This, coupled with Russia's plans to link its control of the Northern
Sea Route with China's Polar Silk Road, indicates a major initiative to
influence and control evolving Arctic economic
activities.^101^ Expanding Russian Arctic military infrastructure will
make this a natural outcome, as the country's unfettered ability to
operate in the region will give its power to dictate Arctic rules.

Following the reopening of Cold War--era Arctic military bases and an
expanded Arctic footprint, Russia's intent to militarize the Arctic and
secure its security interests is broadly advertised. Such a rapid and
extensive military infrastructure investment in a targeted region
indicates insecurity fueled by a desire to control and exercise
sovereignty throughout the high north. Russia's fear of losing---or
intent to maintain---Arctic influence is undeniable.^102^ Adding to
their physical infrastructure, the Russians have reorganized northern
military units and expanded their Arctic asset portfolio in attempts to
assert military dominance in the region. The Northern Fleet is the
"largest, most powerful, and most modern" of the Russian naval forces
with daily activity throughout the Arctic, though it is not a large
fleet in comparison to US naval fleets.^103^ In Antarctica, Russia
leverages its status as an ATS signatory to influence Antarctic
operations in pursuit of its own objectives, despite disagreements with
New Zealand and others.^104^

Moscow demonstrated its assertiveness with the December 2019
announcement about operational hypersonic missile deployments in the
Arctic.^105^ Beyond this, Russia's icebreaker fleet is the largest in
the world and growing; it has extensive air defense and electronic
warfare capabilities; and its concern about American ballistic missile
submarine deployments is well known.^106^ As Russia expands the "Ice
Curtain," fear and insecurity fuel a military deterrent project in the
Arctic. In other words: **[Russia seeks [an
aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline}**-*looking* **[Arctic military
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deter others and to maintain access
to resources. Russia's economic instability and dependence on the
Arctic's natural resources makes influence over the region imperative
for future national growth and sustainment. However, military expansion
alone does not indicate hostile intent.

There is credence to the idea that Arctic conflict is the last thing
Russia wants, because war would degrade Russia's economic stability. But
a militarily ambitious Russia in the Arctic---perhaps seeking only to
deter others---has had the opposite effect. Rather than preventing
increased militarization from NATO, the United States and its allies
have expanded their Arctic postures and orientation. The security
dilemma is now a polar dilemma. [Russian Arctic aggression rises to
Thucydidean proportion [with]{.mark} indicators of **[intent to
aggress]{.mark}** toward a situation in which the United States is in a
regionally subordinate role.]{.underline}

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} potential or attempted [[shift in the balance
of power]{.underline}]{.mark}---as Allison observed in his chosen
cases---among today's rivals [**[grows more]{.mark} likely [with
each]{.mark} passing [year]{.mark}** [of **investments** in **Arctic
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Applying Allison's framework to the
polar regions illustrates a rising Chinese power intent on securing
influence in both the Arctic and Antarctica by way of polar flying
squadrons, the Polar Silk Road policy, expanding investment in Greenland
and Iceland, and a self-proclaimed label as a "near-Arctic state."
Likewise, Russia's widening and contested claims to Arctic territory,
combined with its buildup of military infrastructure---to secure its
posture and interest in the region---make for an equally compelling
concern indicative of an increasingly self-important state motivated in
part by fear and insecurity. In this context, competing interests and
actions toward the polar regions to date are beginning to meet
Thucydides's two preconditions for realization of this trap.

Avoiding an American Polar Trap

Critics of Allison's Thucydides Trap argue his vision of hegemony's rise
and fall is too static, that it lacks nuance and consideration for the
unique aspects of each period and the relative dynamics shaping
competition and conflict decisions. Despite the critiques, Allison's
frame is a useful heuristic for considering the potentialities of
great-power war stemming from polar-region confrontation and conflict.
Just as German efforts toward "political hegemony and maritime
ascendancy" threatened England in the early pre--World War I era,
simultaneous---and sometimes complementary---Chinese and Russian efforts
to reject the current international system threaten American
hegemony.^107^

Debates over the extent and intent of Chinese and Russian ambition
continue. Whether they pose an existential threat to American hegemony
is also debatable, but what is not debatable is that the levels of
Chinese and Russian polar presence, power, posture, and policy dwarf
those of the United States. There is a growing literature arguing that
the US-backed world order is in decline and that Russia and China are
the principal challengers to the ecology of this order---seeking to
write the obituary to US hegemony. For those who reject notions of
conflict with Russia or China, we know that it "makes no sense to think
that hegemonic systems, or international orders more generally, will
ever be free from violence and coercion."^108^

The evolving situation in the polar regions is indicative of China and
Russia's intent to challenge the status quo. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark}
continued [**[US inaction]{.mark}** toward the polar regions,
[**Russian** and Chinese]{.mark} geostrategic [**advantages will
increase**, and]{.mark} the **[capabilities gap will widen]{.mark}** to
an insurmountable distance. This could [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} an
American [**[catastrophe]{.mark}** if a **polar crisis**
occurred.]{.underline}

### Russian Arctic---aggression

**Moscow is planning for Arctic war---the only reason they haven't

"Russia\'s Arctic Military Posture in the Context of the War against
Ukraine" *The Arctic Institute*
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/
October 31, 2024)

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 did not alter
Russia's Arctic military posture. If anything, [Moscow's obsessive
search for **complete control** over **the Arctic** Zone]{.underline} of
the Russian Federation (AZRF) [has been vindicated by wider geopolitical
developments.]{.underline} Nevertheless, [[**Finland's** and
**Sweden'**]{.mark}**s** **accession** to **NATO** [is making **Russia
feel more vulnerable**]{.mark} from a military point of
view]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} self-perception of vulnerability [will inform how
Russia projects itself in the region, especially through]{.underline}
low intensity [warfare operations against NATO and its
allies]{.underline} -- which in turn raises the risk of miscalculation
and escalation in a changing Arctic.

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

[From Moscow's viewpoint, the perceived 'enlargement' of NATO to Finland
and Sweden is fueling]{.underline} both a [sense of vindication and
vulnerability]{.underline} across the AZRF -- geographically extending
from the North Atlantic and the European High North, to North Pole
approaches in the Central Arctic, to the North Pacific and the Bering
Strait.

On the one hand, [Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement'^1)^ by
the Atlantic Alliance has been validated by Finland and Sweden joining
NATO. **The double accession represents [a *fait accompli* for the
Kremlin]{.mark}**, honed by a self-reinforcing propagandistic
**narrative** that the **Alliance is turning the Arctic into a 'conflict
zone**'^2)^** **or that there is a 'new Cold War'^3)^ in the region
because of Western policy.]{.underline}

[This narrative is [**compounded** by the]{.mark}]{.underline} recent
release of the [US National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in
2022 and the **US** **[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[D]{.mark}**efense **[Arctic Strategy]{.mark}** in **2024**, which are
also [denounced as]{.mark} '**deciding** the region's future by
force'^4)^** **or '**[inviting confrontation]{.mark}**'^5)^ [in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further [fuels the Russian logic
that the non-Russian Arctic has become 'NATO territory']{.underline}.
[This ends up creating a '**NATO 7 vs. Russi**a'^6)^** **approach, which
tends to **securitize Arctic affairs** and shape discussions
increasingly in military terms. The **policy consequences** are that
**[Moscow is planning]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[more than ever
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** all contingencies, including **[[open
military confrontation in the Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[On the other hand, [from]{.mark} **a [previous perception of]{.mark}
relative regional [strength]{.mark}**]{.underline} and assertive force
posture, **[the impact of [the war has led Moscow to feel vulnerable in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [This vulnerability is
strategic (with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and
military]{.underline}, especially with regards to the impact of climate
change and receding sea ice across the AZRF.

The **[[Russian leadership fears]{.underline}]{.mark}** that a more
accessible Arctic will bring along [[more military activity]{.mark} from
NATO and its allies in the]{.underline} European [Arctic]{.underline}
and above North Pole approaches. It also fears there will be more
military presence from the US and Canada in the Pacific Arctic --
alongside Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and presence.

[The July 2024 [Ukrainian drone
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}^7)^** **[[on]{.mark} the **[Olenya]{.mark}**
air base in the]{.underline} northwestern [Russian Arctic, where
strategic bombers are stationed, also reinforces their sense of
vulnerability -- not least by **[defying]{.mark}** the genuine
[**effectiveness** of **Russian**]{.mark} **regional [air
defense]{.mark}** capabilities.]{.underline}

Ultimately, Moscow does not want to be dispossessed of its control over
the AZRF. The fact that NATO's direct borders with Russia have increased
in size in the Arctic and Baltic theaters will undoubtedly push the
Kremlin to adapt its force projection.

[This]{.underline} situation [will]{.underline} also [**[force]{.mark}**
the [Kremlin to rethink]{.mark} the **[deployment]{.mark}** of
capabilities [across the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} -- not least
towards regional chokepoints in the European High North such as the
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap.

[However]{.underline}, [the consequences of the war against Ukraine have
**not (yet) led to a complete strategic reassessment** regarding
Russia's Arctic military posture]{.underline}. Existing strategic
priorities are linked to:

- Imposing cost on foreign military access to the region (ambitions of
  control), 

- Extending interdiction capabilities beyond the AZRF and removing
  tension away from the Russian Arctic (ambitions of denial) and

- Protecting the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and contested 'internal
  waters.'

Wartime adaptations

[**[If strategic priorities remain unchanged]{.mark}, [Russian force
projection in the Arctic will]{.mark} continue to [adapt to]{.mark}**
the **impact** of the full-scale **invasion** of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The main adaptation is the reshuffle
of the command-and-control (C2) structure in High North.]{.underline}

[In early 2024, the [Russian]{.mark} armed [forces]{.mark}
reverted^8)^** **to the]{.underline} Soviet-era [Moscow and Leningrad
Military Districts, thus officially **[put]{.mark}**ting [an end
to]{.mark}]{.underline} *OSK Sever* and [[the Northern Fleet]{.mark}'s
status as a formal Military District. This change is less about the
Arctic as it took place in the context of the full-scale invasion of
Ukraine to deal with the demands of the war.]{.underline}

[The **[Leningrad MD]{.mark}** [will oversee Arctic]{.mark}-related
operations]{.underline} in the western and central Arctic and connect
with the Eastern MD and the Pacific Fleet. [[This]{.mark} new situation
[will **inevitably** create **integration** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[coherence issues]{.mark}** within the wider **C2
structure.**]{.underline}

Although air, naval, and nuclear capabilities have been left largely
untouched by the war against Ukraine, [[Russia has **lost** **a large
amount**]{.mark}^9)^** **of its spearhead, **[Arctic-capable]{.mark}
conventional ground [forces]{.mark}** located at the borders with
Finland and Norway. **[It will take]{.mark} some [time]{.mark}**
[**before** **Russia can recapitalize** ]{.mark}**its conventional
troops** in **the High North.**]{.underline}

**No Russian aggression in the Arctic now *but* only because of
[deterrence gap]{.underline}.**

Power on Vulnerable Ice" *Wilson Center* and the *Polar Institute.*

[The]{.underline} consequences of the [**[war against
Ukraine]{.underline}** [have]{.underline}]{.mark} [fundamentally
[altered Russia]{.mark}'s self-perception [in the **Arctic**.
From]{.mark} a **[relative]{.mark}** position of regional
**[strength]{.mark}** and assertive force posture]{.underline} that the
Kremlin displayed since the mid2000s,19 **[military and strategic
superiority has [now]{.mark} been replaced by]{.underline}** a sense of
**[[vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.20

Vulnerability is both strategic---[with]{.underline} the [Finnish and
Swedish accessions to NATO and]{.underline} subsequent [increase in
regional military presence and activity]{.underline}---and military,
compounded by the impact of climate change. Indeed, [sea ice melting and
year-round navigation in Arctic waters forces Russia to deploy more
presence and capabilities]{.underline}---not least in the context of the
NSR.

[Moscow fears that a more accessible AZRF will inevitably bring more
surface and subsurface activity from NATO and its allies in the European
Arctic]{.underline} and above North Pole approaches. Furthermore,
[[receding ice makes]{.mark} strategic **[sub]{.mark}**marine[s]{.mark}
more [detectable]{.mark}, therefore "**[threatening]{.mark}** Russia's
ability to retaliate a nuclear [first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}".21

There might be a point where [[the **Kremlin** will **no longer** have
the ability to **exercise full presence**]{.mark} **in the Arctic** and
have to prioritize certain missions,]{.underline} therefore **[[creating
a deterrence gap against NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Moscow feels more vulnerable in the Arctic, Russia is also becoming
more confrontational in its approach. The Kremlin is using 'NATO's
expansion' and the Alliance's growing interest in Arctic affairs as a
means to 'defend' itself against Western presence closer to the AZRF and
the NSR, as well as protect national interests against foreign
encroachment.22 Russia is also looking closely at the 2022 US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) and the 2023 Implementation Plan:
it is argued that Russia is threatened by US activities going 'beyond
non-miliary security'. 23

This is compounded by Russia's self-made removal from regional
cooperative structures---especially the Arctic Council in March 2022.24
Russia also withdrew from the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BAEC) in
September 202325 while the updated Foreign Policy Concept of March 2023
removed all mention to multilateral Arctic cooperation formats.26

Overall, Russia's internal and external discourse around the Arctic is
hardening and increasingly securitized.27 In Moscow's eyes, the Arctic
is therefore seen as a territory of competition and military tension as
well as 'growing conflict potential'. 28 Further to this, it is expected
that the Kremlin will respond to NATO's enlargement in the coming months
in terms of conventional power demonstration, sub-threshold activities,
and potentially escalatory behavior.29 Like in other theaters, Russia's
aggressive rhetoric and posturing is part of an established playbook
serving both internal propaganda and scaremongering against NATO and
Western allies.

Another consequence of Russia's war is the geographic extension of the
frontline with NATO, the United States, and its allies across the Arctic
and the AZRF.30 As the Kremlin understands circumpolar geography as an
interconnected strategic continuum, Finland and Sweden joining the
Alliance is putting more emphasis on the protection of the Russian
Arctic---further to risks of horizontal escalation to and from the North
Atlantic and the Baltic Sea area.

Indeed, NATO's direct borders with Russia have increased in size with
Sweden and Finland's accession to the Alliance, therefore forcing Russia
to adapt its posture and capabilities across all Arctic sectors and
geographical chokepoints. NATO's presence also threatens Russia's ground
line of communication between St Petersburg and naval infrastructure in
the Baltic Sea and on the Kola Peninsula.31

In the air, joint Nordic (Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish) air defense
and patrols will also increase Russia's sense of vulnerability across
the Baltic Sea theater as well as across the Barents Sea and the Kola
Peninsula. At sea, Russian submarine operations will also be more
vulnerable.

2: Russia's Arctic strategic priorities

The consequences of the war against Ukraine have not led to a strategic
reassessment in Moscow regarding its Arctic posture. Conversely, the war
reinforced existing military priorities, and especially across regional
chokepoints. In military terms, strategic priorities pertain to:32

1\. Ambitions of control: imposing cost on foreign military access to
the circumpolar region through systematic disruption and contestation,

2\. Ambitions of denial: extending interdiction capabilities beyond the
AZRF and removing tension away from the Russian Arctic,

3\. Protecting the Northern Sea Route and Russia's contested
interpretation of 'internal waters',

21---Ambitions of control: imposing cost on foreign military access In
the European Arctic, Moscow's primary concern is and remains the safety
and survivability of the sea-based nuclear deterrent deployed on the
Kola peninsula. Local military infrastructure hosts about two-thirds of
the secondstrike nuclear capabilities, alongside the headquarters of the
Northern Fleet. On top of the fleet of ballistic-missile submarines,
Russia aims to protect the air-based nuclear deterrent that can be
deployed in Arctic bases, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk
Oblast, as well as the critical energy infrastructure located on the
Yamal peninsula.

The Kremlin therefore seeks absolute control over the access and
activity of foreign military assets across all domains---especially sea
control---as well as to ensure uncontested access for the Russian armed
forces.33 Control over the Kola peninsula and beyond is achieved through
the Bastion defense concept, a Soviet-inherited strategy based on a
multi-layered 'protective dome' of air defense, sea-denial, and coastal
defense systems along critical chokepoints of the AZRF.34

Russia's multi-layered Bastion concept offers a wide range of
Arctic-capable sea, air, and coastal defense capabilities.35 It is
complemented by a network of long-range domain awareness radars and ISR
capabilities, electronic warfare assets aimed at degrading operations in
a contested environment, and air superiority and patrol aircrafts
deployed along regional bases.36 Despite the war against Ukraine, the
Bastion network remains largely in place and operational.

With a strong emphasis on sea and air denial, the Bastion effectively
creates an interdiction perimeter, therefore imposing a high cost on
foreign access and operation.37 The extension of Bastion capabilities
towards the Barents and Norwegian Seas aims to give Russia more defense
in depth for the protection of the nuclear deterrent, the Northern
Fleet, and other assets. The Bastion also protects a major access point
to the NSR in the High North.38 Finally, the Bastion network aims to
remove military tension away from the Kola peninsula and from the AZRF
in the European Arctic.

In the Pacific Arctic, at the other end of the NSR between the Chukchi
and Bering Seas, Russia is increasingly projecting military strength on
both sides of the Bering Strait. The Bering Strait represents the
eastern gateway to the NSR. Towards the North Pacific, Russian access to
the region is protected by military infrastructure on the Kamchatka
peninsula and the Sea of Okhotsk. The remainder of the sea-based nuclear
deterrent is located with the Pacific Fleet and based in Vilyuchinsk on
the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The Bering Strait represents a regional chokepoint that could be
potentially threatened by Russian deployments.39 Indeed, Moscow has
never ratified the 1990 USSR--US Maritime Boundary Agreement, marking
the border between the US and Russia.40 If the Kremlin, for now, follows
the Agreement and respects the delineation along the Baker--Shevardnadze
line, there is no guarantee it might not contest its status in the
future in terms of freedom of navigation across the Strait, shared
maritime traffic, and regional governance.41 Contestation would be a
critical issue for the US in terms of national security in Alaska as
well as for unhampered access across the North Pacific sea lines of
communication.

The situation with the Bering Strait is further compounded by Russia's
aggressive policy towards the Kuril Islands/ Northern Territories as
well as its willingness to increase defense in depth in the North
Pacific against US theatre missile defense deployments.42 By the Sea of
Okhotsk and the Kamchatka peninsula, Russia has deployed a string of
coastal and near-sea capabilities akin to the Bastion network on the
other side of the AZRF.

However, Pacific deployments are in no way comparable with their
European counterpart, nor are they creating an 'Okhotsk Bastion'. Like
in the North Atlantic, Russia does not possess the ability to conduct
SLOC interdiction operations in the region or to project ambitions of
control and denial. Nevertheless, this Kuril-Chukchi defensive line43
poses a threat to Japanese national security44 and represents an issue
for US assets in the North Pacific and Alaska. There is a worrying track
record of repeated strategic bombers patrols over international waters
in the Sea of Japan as well as near the western coast of Alaska.45 These
overflights are generally accompanied by a fighter escort.46

Finally, Russia's posture in the Pacific Arctic is somewhat strengthened
by regional military activities with China. Beijing and Moscow are now
regularly conducting joint aviation patrols and strategic bomber
overflights over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, close to the
Japanese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).47 More worryingly, they
are also organizing brazen air violations and airspace incursions,
especially over Japan and South Korea.48 The aim is to contest US
presence and theater missile deployments as well as sovereignty over the
disputed Kuril Islands/Northern Territories with Japan.49

22---Ambitions of denial: increasing defense in depth

Beyond ambitions of control over the AZRF and regional military
infrastructure, the Kremlin seeks to project defense in depth beyond its
territory by extending out-of-area capabilities in the European Arctic.
Moscow aims to complicate, if not deny, direct access to its Arctic
coastline by projecting a mix of long-range sea- and airspace-denial
capabilities (notably standoff missile systems). It also aims to limit,
if not deflect, conventional precision strikes from NATO.50

With Finland and Sweden joining NATO in mind, the intended objective is
to remove tension and potential hostilities away from the AZRF by
extending the Bastion concept beyond the Kola peninsula. The objective
is to quickly establish perimeter control over the Peninsula and offer
greater security for the deployment of strategic submarines and other
Northern Fleet assets. In other words, Moscow likely discounts starting
a conflict in the Arctic per se. It is, however, not excluding potential
hostilities in an Arctic environment and planning for it.

Moscow's ambitions of control within the AZRF and out-of-area ambitions
of denial across the North Atlantic theater are putting more pressure on
the North Atlantic Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC). This situation
would potentially leave US assets and NATO reinforcements at risk of
operating in a contested environment to and from the North Atlantic and
the Baltic Sea theater.

Russia's posture also potentially threatens regional chokepoints,
especially the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap and the
Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) gap between the Svalbard archipelago,
Bear Island (Bjørnøya), and mainland Norway.

Considered 'the border between Russian and NATO-dominated seas', 51
these chokepoints are at risk of contestation by Russia's out-of-area
capabilities. Regional demonstrations of Russian presence and operations
around the GIUKGIN gaps are likely to multiply, with the willingness to
contest NATO's presence and freedom of navigation, create a contested
environment, and complicate access and reinforcement across the North
Atlantic SLOC and the Baltic Sea.

The willingness to extend defense in depth through denial capabilities
represents a credible threat to US and NATO military assets located in
northern Europe (Bodø air station in Norway) as well as further in
Iceland (Keflavik naval air station) and Greenland (Pituffik space
base). These infrastructures are theoretically within reach of Russian
air capabilities.52

[It is unlikely,]{.underline} however, [that **[Russia]{.mark}** can
deploy and sustain interdiction operations]{.underline} so far beyond
the AZRF: [the Kremlin [does not have]{.mark} the **[air
superiority]{.mark}** assets, the ISR capabilities, and airlift and
sealift to conduct such operations]{.underline}. In other words, Moscow
is unlikely to be able to 'close the gap' around the North Atlantic or
conduct 'SLOC interdiction operations'.53

Pressure on the North Atlantic SLOC and the GIUK-GIN gaps is also adding
more strain on the Svalbard archipelago. The Kremlin resents Norway's
status over the archipelago and the 1920 Svalbard Treaty (especially
regarding potential military activities by Norway)54 as well as the
management of the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ). Russia has
been increasing the frequency of naval patrols around the archipelago
since the 2000s and does not shy away from regular demonstrations of
presence in Barentsburg and Pyramiden.55 Conversely, Moscow denounces
reported NATO attempts at militarizing the archipelago.56

There is value for Russia in projecting force toward Svalbard,
especially sea-denial and air defense capabilities in the Barents Sea,
toward the Norwegian Sea, and the North Atlantic SLOC. Svalbard's
geographical position, between the Kola Peninsula and the GIUK-N gaps,
is of strategic importance for Russian out-of-area denial operations.57
Halfway between the archipelago and mainland Norway, Bear Island
(Bjørnøya) is also particularly relevant for potential interdiction
operations.

[Despite aggressive rhetoric]{.underline} against Norwegian and NATO
interests, [Moscow is unlikely to deploy troops]{.underline}, conduct a
'land grab' against Svalbard,58 or directly challenge Norwegian
sovereignty59 (not least because the archipelago is NATO territory).
[The Kremlin could]{.underline}, however, potentially
[conduct]{.underline} more sub-threshold or [grey zone
operations]{.underline} there.60 In the context of the war, Russia could
also choose a more nationalistic approach towards the archipelago and
engineer the arrival of Russian citizens in Barentsburg and Pyramiden.

In the Pacific Arctic, Russian deployments along the Kuril-Chukchi
defensive line and on the Kamchatka Peninsula have limited capacity to
achieve sea and air denial over parts of the North Pacific and the
Bering Strait. Because of geography, the impact of climate change,61 and
the spread-out location of regional military assets, sea- and airdenial
capabilities deployed around the Sea of Okhotsk and beyond are hardly a
'protective dome' covering far-sea approaches in the North Pacific.62
[**[Russia could]{.mark} potentially [contest]{.mark}** the presence of
**[US]{.mark} and allied [forces]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}
(especially from the US Eielson Air Force base in Alaska), [[but
**unlikely**]{.mark} **able [to pose genuine]{.mark}**]{.underline}
interdiction [**[challenges]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

23---Protecting the Northern Sea Route and contested 'internal waters'

Access and navigation through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) are deeply
impacted by climate change and receding sea ice.63 In Moscow's strategic
thinking, the receding sea is no longer offering the same amount of
natural protection from human presence---whether civilian or
military---in the AZRF approaches. Climate change is therefore creating
a 'new' border that Russia must defend through increased perimeter
control and protect in terms of sovereignty enforcement.64

Recent strategic documents reflect the connection between climate change
and the need to control foreign access across the AZRF and the NSR to
protect perceived national interests.65 Furthermore, the Russian
Security Council created an Interdepartmental Commission in 2020 to
mitigate 'internal and external threats to national security in the
Arctic'66---read foreign military activity.

Russia anticipates foreign presence on both sides of the NSR as well as
along the Central Arctic Ocean, linked to international shipping.67
Fueled by a similar sense of encirclement present in other theaters, the
Kremlin sees its 'new' northern border as weaker than during the Soviet
era, where it was only at risk of US strategic bomber overflights
through North Pole approaches. In recent times, due to seasonal changes
in sea ice, Moscow fears that [increased access and presence will
automatically bring **NATO** and **[US]{.mark} surface and air
[deployments]{.mark}**, [as well as]{.mark} heightened
**[sub]{.mark}**marine **[activity]{.mark}**]{.underline} closer to the
NSR. [Foreign subsurface activity is **[an issue]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
the freedom of operation of **[Russian SSBNs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
the **protection** of **the** **sea-based nuclear deterrent** [and
**Kola**]{.mark} **infrastructure.**]{.underline}

To defend and protect the 'new' border, Russia has been militarizing NSR
approaches by revamping and modernizing local infrastructure along the
AZRF (see chapter 2), deploying a network of dual-use ISR and MDA
capabilities, and conducting joint training with the FSB to 'defend' the
NSR.68 'Full radar control' over the NSR remains a priority for the
development of the NSR from a military and economic point of view. 69

The military priority is to extend strategic depth and perimeter defense
over the NSR,70 further to interdiction capabilities deployed in
regional chokepoints. There are several geographical chokepoints along
the NSR where Russia has been enhancing perimeter control and deploying
surveillance and domain awareness capabilities: by the Kara Gate and
Novaya Zemlya at the European entrance of the NSR; the Vilkitskii Strait
by Severnaya Zemlya; the Sannikov and Laptev Straits by the East
Siberian Islands; by Wrangel Island; and the Bering Strait, at the
Pacific entrance of the NSR.

Another form of control over the NSR is the self-appropriation of the
legal regime covering waterways along the AZRF. Russia refers to Article
234 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to justify the
status of the NSR as a body of internal water regulated by national
rules.

Article 234 (also known as the 'Ice Clause') provisions that a coastal
state can increase control over 'ice-covered areas within the limits of
the exclusive economic zone'. 71 The issue is that the Kremlin tends to
overinterpret the definition of this clause by introducing
discriminatory national regulations violating the Law of the Sea.
Indeed, Russia has been heavily restricting foreign access to the NSR,
strengthening navigation rules and transits, and closing off passage to
certain types of vessels through successive national regulations
enforcing an internal control regime.72

Since 2019, foreign military vessels have been limited in their ability
to access and transit the NSR.73 The December 2022 law updates an
already stringent legal regime for foreign military assets seeking to
transit through internal waters (but not the whole NSR) with mandatory
advance notifications, among other provisions.74

Russia's unique interpretation of the NSR status therefore offers the
possibility to fully control access and passage of surface vessels
through the Route as well as regulate sea and air approaches. These
regulations are forcing the appropriation of the NSR as an 'uncontested'
body of internal water regulated under Russian law and no longer bound
that UNCLOS under principles of freedom of navigation and innocent
passage.75 Yet Moscow fears that its contested interpretation of the Ice
Clause might be challenged by receding sea ice as well as by foreign
actors (see chapter 3).

The current situation is compounded by the February 2023 recognition by
the UNCLSC of Russia's extended Arctic continental shelf.76 The seabed
claim confirmation will undeniably give Moscow more fuel to justify the
continued status of the NSR---as evidenced by governmental
discussions.77

Finally, in Russian calculations, control over the NSR is key to
protecting North Pole approaches from the perceived US and NATO threat.
Russia's central Arctic, covering the four main archipelagos (Novaya
Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian
Islands), is paramount to the security of the AZRF. Here, Moscow
emphasizes air defense and strategic bomber presence to counter US
strategic bomber overflights across the North Pole78 as well as US
ballistic missile defense deployments in the North Pacific.79

Chapter 2: The impact of the war on Russia's Arctic presence and
deployments

In the context of the war against Ukraine and Russia's increased
perception of regional vulnerability across the Arctic theater, the
Kremlin is currently going through a reorganization of related command
structures as well as a reassessment of military capabilities,
especially in the context of wider wartime recapitalization.80

Russia's Arctic infrastructure and capabilities can be argued to be
'double dual' in nature.81 They are fundamentally dual-use, namely
interchangeably used for civilian and military purposes and
missions---the most telling example relates to ongoing discussions about
'combat icebreakers'82 (see below). Infrastructure and capabilities also
serve a dual-purpose: the Kremlin's approach completely blurs the lines
between offensive intent and defensive purposes--- it is both at the
same time and arguably understood as 'assertive defense'. 83

Despite seeking to remove tension from the AZRF, the 'double dual' logic
is further compounded by the fact that Moscow is planning for all
contingencies in the Arctic, including war operations. Indeed, the
Kremlin has been actively remilitarizing the AZRF since the late 2000s
through the (re)construction of regional infrastructure and (re)
investing in Arctic-capable military capabilities.

1: Recent evolutions in Russia's Arctic force structure

[The war against [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} and the accession of
Finland and Sweden to NATO [have **[completely altered]{.mark}** the
**Kremlin's**]{.underline} plans in terms of the **[force
structure.]{.underline}** The mainstay of Russia's force structure in
the European Arctic and the central Arctic is the Northern Fleet. Its
primary mission is to maintain strategic forces, ensure the protection
and survivability of strategic assets and infrastructure on the Kola
Peninsula and the AZRF, as well as protect the NSR in the western and
central Arctic.84

To streamline Arctic operations and command structure, the Northern
Fleet was turned into a full-fledged Military District (MD) in January
2021.85 The intended goal was to better integrate troops across the
western and central Arctic, and especially regarding the Bastion
network, and streamline Russia's command and control.

This failed 'experiment' in force structure only lasted until late 2023.
Indeed, in the context of the war against Ukraine, a draft presidential
decree from 8 October 202386 announced the restoration of the Soviet-era
Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts as well as the deprivation of
the Northern Fleet of its status as a formal Military District. OSK
Sever was officially disbanded on 1 March 2024: the Northern Fleet was
subsequently stripped of its status and absorbed into the Leningrad MD.
Ground forces, aviation and naval aviation, and air defense systems were
also transferred to the Leningrad MD.

By reverting to pre-2010 formations, Moscow's decision effectively split
the Western MD into the Moscow MD and the Leningrad MD, covering the
AZRF in the Komi Republic, Arkhangelsk and Murmansk oblasts, and the
Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The Leningrad MD will be in charge of most of
the AZRF coastline in the western and central Arctic, including new NATO
members Finland and Sweden. Meanwhile, the Moscow MD will likely focus
its attention on Ukraine and Kaliningrad.

The announcement to revamp the military structure is merely a
consequence of the war against Ukraine and NATO's enlargement. Moscow is
seeking to streamline the command structure in the context of the war
against Ukraine, strengthen strategic deterrence against NATO in the
Baltic Sea theater,87 as well as prepare for potential regional
escalation. [Russia's restructuring of **[Arctic]{.mark}**-related
**[c]{.mark}**ommand **[and]{.mark}** **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline}
is therefore not Arctic-specific nor linked to a willingness to increase
operations in the region.

The idea of putting a fleet and a navy command in charge of its own
Military District was, on paper, an innovative idea for the Russian
armed forces. However, since its inception, [OSK Sever faced
**[organizational issues]{.mark}** that]{.underline} ~~crippled~~
[\[**[destroyed]{.mark}**\] its **[efficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Its **integration** into the wider **Russian military
command**]{.underline} [was ultimately **thwarted**]{.underline} as a
direct consequence of the war and the Finnish and Swedish accessions.

The return to pre-Serdyukov reform, Soviet-inherited command structures
in the European theater will take time before it is fully integrated
into the wider C2. It also remains to be seen how effective the command
change will be, notably as Russia is arguably lacking mass and
capabilities to sustain two full-fledged MDs there.

2: Arctic forces, infrastructure, and demonstration of presence

21---Conventional losses in the European Arctic

[The war against Ukraine has decimated Russian ground forces located in
the]{.underline} European **[Arctic]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**-related [troops deployed in Ukraine
suffered heavy losses]{.underline}, especially from the 76th Guards Air
Assault Division, 61st 'Red Banner' Independent Naval Infantry Brigade
(Pechenga, 14th Army Corps), and the 40th Separate Guards Marine Brigade
(Pacific Fleet).88 Elements from [Kola peninsula [**naval infantry** and
**special forces**]{.mark} have also **[suffered heavy casualties in
Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline},89 for instance from the 140th Special
Purpose Detachment (Northern Fleet, special underwater forces).90

[The **Arctic Brigade**]{.underline} [has also suffered **heavy** losses
in Ukraine.]{.underline} The Arctic Brigade, partly composing the 14th
Army Corps (Northern Fleet), is formed by the 200th Separate Motor Rifle
Brigade, located in Pechenga, and the 80th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade
in Alakurtti, close to the border with Finland. The 80th Brigade was
engaged in Ukraine, [[leaving]{.mark} the **Alakurtti base** reportedly
**[emptied]{.mark}** of troops and military hardware.]{.underline}91

The most emblematic example of losses in Ukraine comes from [the 200th
Separate Motor Rifle Brigad]{.underline}e, which reportedly
[[lost]{.mark} **[thousands]{.mark}** of troops]{.underline} in various
ambushes in the Kharkiv region.92 Local media reports further attest of
the poor state of Russian ground forces in Pechenga.93 Furthermore, it
was reported that [both [the **commander**]{.mark} of the 200th Brigade,
Colonel Denis Kurilo, [and the **deputy commande**]{.mark}**r** of the
14th Army Corps, General Aleksandr Zavadsky **were killed in
Ukraine**]{.underline}**.**94

Until 2022, the Arctic Brigade and other troops in the European Arctic
used to be showcased as Arctic-capable, combat-ready, and well-equipped
forces. However, like many others, they were not suited for the reality
of the battlefield in Ukraine. [Russia now pays the consequences of
sending highly specialized Arctic troops to slaughter, as **i[t will
take years to regenerate troops]{.mark}**, **train them**, [and]{.mark}
retain the cadre of **commanding [officers]{.mark}**]{.underline}.95

To cope with **[the decimation of the Arctic Brigade]{.underline}** and
adapt to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, the Kremlin decided to merge
both Brigades into divisions and turn the 14th Army Corps into a
combined arms army.96 [**Russia** also **[lost]{.mark}** **hundreds of
pieces of [equipment]{.mark}** from the aforementioned troops,97 thus
[creating **conventional shortcomings**]{.mark}, especially with
**artillery**.]{.underline} As many regional ground forces have been
deployed and killed in Ukraine, this leaves the Russian land border with
Finland less protected. [This proverbial hole in defenses means that
[Russia]{.mark} now [represents **less of a**]{.mark}]{.underline}
convention [**[threat to NATO in the region]{.mark}**---and **less**
**likely** to conduct **high-intensity op**eration**s** i[n the
**short**]{.mark} to **medium [term]{.mark}**]{.underline}.98

The corollary is that the current military situation in the European
Arctic is strengthening [Russia's growing]{.underline} sense of
**[regional inferiority]{.underline}**---not least in terms of
conventional capabilities.99 [**It will take years** before the armed
forces can retrain and re-equip land forces and naval
infantry]{.underline} of the Kola Peninsula to pre-2022 standards of
readiness.100

22---Infrastructure and bases

Russia's Arctic ambitions are embodied by the (re)construction of a vast
but disparate network of forward bases, outposts, and airfields dotted
along the AZRF and the Northern Sea Route.101 To facilitate the swift
reappropriation of a region that was left to rot in the 1990s, [the
Kremlin opted for a 'build cheap, build fast' approach to Arctic
infrastructure]{.underline}: most of the military infrastructure has
been either rebuilt from legacy Soviet outposts or built off the shelf
and co-located with coast guard and border guard infrastructure in
charge of search and rescue operations and constabulary missions. This
further strengthens Russia's 'double-dual' approach to the Arctic in
terms of dual-use infrastructure and dual-purpose missions.

It is often argued that Russia has more bases in the Arctic than the
rest of the NATO 7 altogether.102 However, [the Russian network is in
**poor shape**]{.underline}. [Russian military
infrastructure]{.underline} along the AZRF [represents a disparate
network of small,]{.underline} relatively **[[understaffed
bases]{.underline}]{.mark}** ~~crippled~~ [\[weakened\] by
**[resupplying]{.mark}** and servicing [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This situation is compounded by harsh meteorological conditions along
the AZRF,103 the poor quality of construction material, and the
tremendous impact of climate change on Russia's Arctic
infrastructure.104 It is also likely that, [due to geography, Moscow
does not have continuous and complete radar coverage]{.underline} over
all of the AZRF: [there are]{.underline} arguably [[**gaps** in
**Russia's**]{.mark} **earlywarning [radar]{.mark} system** in the
central and Eastern **Arctic**]{.underline}.105

Russia's ongoing [**[modernization]{.mark}** plan [of]{.mark} its
**[Arctic military]{.mark}** infrastructure]{.underline} now seems to
prioritize completing and maintaining the existing network and no longer
seeking to expand it.106 In the context of the war, the development of
new infrastructure [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
**[[slowing]{.underline}]{.mark}** down---not least [[because of
**budget constraint**]{.mark} and the **cost** of mitigating the impact
of **climate change.**]{.underline}

This situation is compounded by issues linked to the integration of the
existing network into a unified and coherent command structure. Recent
changes in the past few years---from the rise and fall of OSK Sever to
the creation of the Moscow Military District in 2024---are further
complicating the matter. Now that the Northern Fleet has lost its status
of MD overseeing European and central Arctic operations, the exact
separation of the command structure between the Moscow, Central, and
Eastern Military Districts remains unclear

[The **Kremlin** might **struggle** to recreate a sense of **coherence**
for **Arctic operations** in the wake of the 2024 reform, further
**[strengthening]{.mark}** **Moscow's** increased sense of **[regional
vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The situation could be further
compounded by potential issues in achieving a coherent C2 structure
throughout the different combatant commands and units spread across the
AZRF.107

Three key priorities can be made out about Arctic military
infrastructure management. First, ensuring the 'Bastionization' of the
nuclear deterrent infrastructure on both sides of Russia's Arctic. Kola
peninsula infrastructure has the utmost priority in terms of
modernization, as exemplified by the constant renovation happening at
the Severomorsk 1 and 2 and the Gadzhiyevo bases,108 the modernization
of the Murmansk oblast military towns starting 2022,109 and the upgrade
of the Tiksi port infrastructure on the Laptev Sea coast scheduled for
2025.110

In the Pacific Arctic, infrastructure in the Far East and Kamchatka are
also maintained and upgraded to protect the Pacific Fleet nuclear
deterrence, especially near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Kamchatka.111
Regional coastal defense is ensured by several key units, including the
40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky), the 155th Naval
Infantry Brigade (Vladivostok), and the 520th Coastal Missile and
Artillery Brigade (Sakhalin), among others.

The second priority is the maintenance of bases along key NSR
chokepoints to enforce Russia's interpretation of its 'internal' waters
along the AZRF (see chapter 1) and protect regional nuclear
infrastructure. For that purpose, the network of land bases and
airfields has been strengthened by the Kara Strait (Rogachevo on Novaya
Zemlya and Nagurskoye on Franz Josef Land), the Laptev and Sannikov
Straits by the East Siberian Islands (Temp airbase and Kotelny Island
installations) and the strait south of Wrangel Islands.112 These
installations are all complementing the Bastion concept thanks their
multi-layered air and coastal defense capabilities, anti-ship systems,
radar installations for early warning and overall domain awareness, as
well as uncrewed systems and electronic warfare capabilities.

The third priority is the renovation and modernization of airstrips and
runway extensions along the AZRF able to host a variety of attack and
reconnaissance aircraft (MiG-29K, MiG-31, MiG-31BM, Su-24, Su-33),
transport and support aircraft (mainly Il-76 transport aircraft and
Il-78 refueling tankers, Il-38 surveillance aircraft), and strategic
bombers (mostly Tu-160, Tu-95, and Tu-22).113 The 2022 infrastructure
plan concerns the construction of two airfields in Nagurskoye and Temp
as well as the renovation of seven airfields and runway extensions by
2030 (Severomorsk-1, Severomorsk-2,114 Severomorsk-3, Rogachevo,115
Talagi, Kipelovo, and Safonovo seaplane facility).116

23---Trends in military exercises and demonstrations of presence

Since 2015 and the resumption of Arctic training, Russia's presence has
been following a track record of regular military exercises and drills
aimed at demonstrating the Kremlin's power projection.117 Recent trends
in Arctic military training and exercises reflect Russia's dual-purpose
approach to the region, simultaneously blending offensive and defensive
operations.

Russia is practicing offensive and defensive combat operations within
and beyond the AZRF, which is directly linked to the willingness to
remove tension from the region, avoid escalation in the Russian Arctic
and around critical nuclear installations, and protect its perceived
sovereign interests along the NSR.118

On the one hand, offensive combat training affects all combatant arms of
the Northern and Pacific Fleets as well as the nuclear triad.119 These
include long-range missile deployments,120 rapid-reaction deployments
such as coastal assault landings and amphibious assault operations121 as
well as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations.122 Strategic forces
drills emphasize ballistic missile launches123 and strategic bombers
operations.124

On the other hand, Moscow focuses on exercises aimed at protecting
contested waters along the NSR and coastal areas along the AZRF. With a
focus on air defense drills125 and naval maneuvers, exercises emphasize
the cooperation between the Northern and Pacific Fleets across the whole
AZRF as well as regular readiness checks.126

Russia's dual-purpose approach to Arctic training is reflected in the
latest annual trans-Arctic naval exercise that took place in August and
September 2023.127 The drills aim to exercise passage of the Northern
Fleet through the NSR, from the Barents Sea to the East Siberian Sea to
'ensure safe maritime navigation' and protect civilian
infrastructure.128 Pacific Fleet assets also train similarly in the
Chukchi and Bering Seas as part of the Finval drills.129

However, these exercises also aggressively focus on 'anti-terrorist
operations' along the NSR---read rapid-reaction maneuvers, anti-sabotage
operations, coastal warfare, and other amphibious assault drills against
potential NATO troops.130 The same can be said of similar exercises
regularly taking place along the AZRF and focusing on 'crisis situations
in the Arctic Ocean', 131 blending both defensive and offensive
operations.

3: Capabilities and deployments

Russia's Arctic posture has been undeniably informed by the impact of
the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, notably when it comes to losses of
military hardware in Ukraine, future procurement of Arctic-specific
capabilities, and overall re-equipment taking place across the Russian
armed forces. Official state propaganda relates a sense of optimism for
continued procurement of military equipment to 'guarantee the security
of Russia.'132 The appointment of civilian economist Andrei Belousov as
new Minister of Defense in May 2024 will also undoubtedly impact future
procurement opportunities for Arctic-related capabilities.

As mentioned, Russian ground forces in the European Arctic have suffered
heavy losses in both manpower and equipment (see above). The Ukrainian
armed forces reported the destruction of several units of Arctic-enabled
TorM2DT air defense missile systems,DT-30 Vityaz Arctic transport
vehicles, 152mm self-propelled Akatsiya howitzers, and Arctic-hardened
T-80BVM tanks from the Northern Fleet and the Arctic Brigade.133

International targeted [**[sanctions]{.mark}** against the Russian
military-industrial complex]{.underline} since 2014
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [had an [impact]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
pace and scope of Arctic-specific hardware procurement. This is
especially true for **ship [turbines]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**engines**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, the [**production** of
Lider-class **[destroyers]{.mark}**---supposed to become **[the
workhorse of Russia's Arctic naval projection]{.mark}**---is running
**[late]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

More widely, [[**sanctions** are]{.mark} also **[impacting]{.mark}** the
[**production** of s]{.mark}pecial steels and reinforced metallurgic
products needed for **[icebreakers]{.mark}** and **ice-class
vessels**]{.underline} (notably the new LK-60 class of icebreakers),
micro-[**electronic components vital to** **Russia's**]{.underline}
advanced regional multi-layere[d **[air defense]{.underline}**]{.mark}
(notably Pantsir systems, S-300, and S-400) and electronic warfare
capabilities, [as well as **components** for **[Arctic]{.mark}**-capable
**[precision]{.mark}**-guided **[munitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Kalibr, Iskander-M, etc.). [The situation is even more critical for
access to space-grade components, with the risk of seriously limiting
the deployment of the Arktika-M satellite constellation.]{.underline}

[Sanctions are]{.underline} slowly [degrading Russia's maritime domain
awareness and ISR **capabilities** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. As
sanctions continue to affect Russia's ability to regenerate its force
and modernize its capabilities, the operating picture will also look
different in the medium-term regarding Russia's overall power
projection.134

The case of China.\" *International Affairs* (2025): 381--397; doi:
10.1093/ia/iiae330. March 3, 2025)

Chinese national power has increased rapidly over the past few decades.
To make sense of the nature and role of China's rising power, Chinese
scholars and policy-makers have engaged in extended debates. There have
been divergent views and conceptions of the changing world order and
what China could achieve under the current international system, given
power shifts and new directions of Chinese foreign policy. Although a
variety of realist thinking remains the most referenced theoretical
preference, [there is]{.underline} also [much more than just realism in
Chinese thinking]{.underline} and scholarship [about China's future
global role]{.underline}.6 [[China has transformed]{.mark} from a
'revolutionary order-challenger' [to a 'reformist order-shaper']{.mark}
since the years of 'opening up and reforms'.]{.underline} [As China has
become more accepting of the existing world order, its leadership has
sought to reform]{.underline} deficient [aspects of the post-war order
and to promote a vision of a 'human community with a shared
future]{.underline}'.7

**[[A rising power does not necessarily]{.underline}]{.mark}** have the
intention to [change the status quo or [go to war.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Which side provokes and is therefore responsible for war? This is of
course a loaded question. We have solid documentary evidence to assert,
for example, that German leaders sought war deliberately in 1914 and
that Japanese leaders did the same by attacking Pearl Harbor in 1941.8
However, even when we are reasonably certain about which side fired the
first shot, such as in the case of Pearl Harbor, it is arguable as to
which side 'provoked' a particular confrontation. The Japanese assault
on the United States was, for example, a desperate gamble to escape from
the economic stranglehold that the US' embargo of strategic materiel had
imposed on Japan. Similarly, although Britain and France invaded Egypt
in  1956, their leaders would undoubtedly argue that they were provoked
into taking this action by Gamal Abdel Nasser's nationalization of the
Suez Canal. Should we consider the US to be guilty of instigating the
Spanish--American War or initiating the invasion of Iraq and
Afghanistan? Or would one want to argue, in the latter case at least,
that the invasion was provoked by prior actions by those countries'
leaders (such as their alleged support for Al-Qaeda)?

Then there is the question about the definition of war. Would the US
invasion of Grenada in 1983 count as an instance of war, even though
this campaign was brief and resulted in relatively few casualties? How
about the bombings of Serbia and Libya by NATO? Or covert actions, such
as the US' role in the Bay of Pigs invasion carried out in 1961 by Cuban
exiles, or in its supporting the contras in Nicaragua to fight against
the Sandinista government? In short, until we settle issues such as
those we have just raised, it is difficult to accept generalizations
such as Shirk's, which is made with such certitude. It is not clear
whether she would include the US during Theodore Roosevelt's
administration in the category of a rising state, or how she would judge
its foreign policy. Graham [Allison has warned Americans about wishing
the Chinese to be 'more like us', pointing out that]{.underline}:

[The US]{.underline} \[had\] [declared war on Spain]{.underline},
expelling it from the Western Hemisphere and [acquiring Puerto Rico,
Guam, and the Philippines; threatened Germany and Britain with
war]{.underline} unless they agreed to settle disputes on American
terms; [supported an insurrection in Colombia]{.underline} to create a
new country, [Panama]{.underline}, in order to build a canal; and
[declared itself the policeman of the Western Hemisphere, asserting the
right to intervene whenever and wherever it judged
necessary]{.underline}---a right it exercised nine times in the seven
years of TR's \[Theodore Roosevelt's\] presidency alone.9

It is instructive that [[discussions about]{.mark} the ostensible
**[bellicosity of rising states]{.mark}** often [**fail** to **mention
the US**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this context. Moreover, researchers
rarely make explicit comparisons between the conduct of rising states
and their established counterparts, even though such comparison is
implicit in the claim that states of the former type are more likely to
provoke war than those of the latter type. Shirk clearly had China in
mind when she remarked about rising states provoking war. It would
therefore be informative to compare China as a rising state against the
US as an established state. In this regard, Kishore Mahbubani,
Singapore's former permanent representative to the United Nations, has
observed that even [during the relatively peaceful administration of
Barack **[Obama]{.mark}**, the US **[dropped 26,000 bombs on seven
countries in 2016]{.mark}** alone, whereas **[China has not fired a
single shot across its border since
1979]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}10 As remarked earlier, the US
became even more powerful after the demise of the USSR. Although
undertaking intervention abroad is not the same thing as waging war,
incidences of [**[US military intervention]{.mark}** increased rapidly
after the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, rising from 46 in the period
between 1948 and 1991 [to [188 between 1992
and 2017]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 It is not clear whether Shirk had the
US in mind when she made her remark about rising states, but it is
ironic that as it became even more powerful, the lone, hyperactive
superpower was more inclined to throw its weight around.

Arguably, the rises and falls of great powers have been associated in
some fashion with the occurrence and outcome of wars. Some such violent
episodes involved foreign conquests during the era of colonialism and
imperialism. Others were interstate wars that raised the stature of
winners and demoted that of the vanquished (such as the demise of the
Austro-Hungarian empire after the First World War, and the rise of the
US and USSR after the Second World War). Still others involved the
conclusion of struggles for national unification (as in the cases of
Germany and Italy), and the settlement of civil wars (including those
for the US, the USSR and China). Thus, while war can be a result of
interstate power shifts as implied by Shirk's remark, it can also be the
cause of interstate power shifts. Reciprocal influence is present in the
relationship between power shifts and war occurrence (or outcome).
Significantly, China's recent rise has been due exclusively to the
growth of its domestic economy. This remark does not deny the fact that
China has historically waged many wars of aggression and conquest. But
it does suggest a certain irony when the danger of war is raised with
respect to China's rise---when so many of its predecessors became great
and established powers due to war. Not to put too fine a point on it,
western commentators on the threat to peace posed by a rising China
often appear to have a selective amnesia about how their own countries
had risen to join the ranks of great powers.

Rising states and revisionist motivation

The idea of revisionism provides the critical linchpin connecting rising
states to their alleged challenge of the international order. [Rising
states are supposed to be motivated to alter the rules and norms of this
order: hence, they are characterized as revisionist.]{.underline} It is
critically important to underscore that revisionism is what connects
rising states to their ostensible threat to the international community.
In this view, changing power distribution among states does not in
itself cause war; rather, war happens when those states dissatisfied
with the status quo have gained capabilities to alter it. Yet one rarely
hears about a definition of revisionism, and one is seldom given a
checklist of traits that describes revisionist states. Analysts use the
term 'revisionism' as if everyone will agree on its meaning and
therefore no clarification is required. [The word '[**revisionism'**
is]{.mark} more often **deployed as [a code word]{.mark}** to indicate
that a commentator is critical of the country being assigned this label,
rather than as an analytic concept deserving **serious** **research**
consideration.]{.underline}12

How are revisionist states in general supposed to look or act? How are
they supposed to be different from the 'status quo countries'? We do not
have any explicit---not to mention consensual---benchmarks for assigning
countries to these categories. It appears in current discourse that most
rising revisionist states have one characteristic in common: they are
usually defeated states that have lost wars fighting established powers,
a characteristic attributed to them retrospectively after the identity
of the belligerents and the outcomes of wars have become known. This
tendency in turn raises the question of whether states are considered
revisionist because they had started wars---or because they had lost
wars. Alternatively, [in applying **this label** to China, Iran and
North Korea, it is simply used **[to designate an enemy]{.mark}** or
troublemaker, suggesting that this country is not 'one of
us'.]{.underline}

[But why should rising states]{.underline} in particular [have a
revisionist motivation to challenge and undermine the existing
international order?]{.underline} Unlike most other researchers,
Organski and Kugler explained their logic explicitly.13 According to
them, rising states want to replace the existing international order
because they were not at the table when the rules of this order were
decided and because they see these rules as having been deliberately
rigged to favour the established states. Seeing them in this light, [it
becomes immediately evident that it is one-sided to assert that rising,
revisionist states are responsible for destabilizing international
order; indeed, 'it takes two to tangle'. **[Why do the
established]{.mark}** but declining **[states refuse to accommodate the
rising]{.mark} states'** demand for greater recognition?]{.underline}
[The blame for starting war should be shared by these states to the
extent that they decline to adjust their privileges and trim the sense
of entitlement that is no longer warranted in view of their recent or
ongoing decline.]{.underline}

The logic implicit in the view that rising states are revisionist and
thus prone to provoking war is that as dissatisfied states they have the
incentive to challenge the international order, and that upon gaining
the capabilities to actually undertake such a challenge they become a
source of instability. This argument, however, overlooks the possibility
that as rising states, they also acquire a larger stake in the status
quo. Moreover, **[[why should they overthrow the international order
that has facilitated their ascendance?]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Conversely, why should the established states be forever committed to
the defence of the existing order, since the rules of this order have
not prevented their relative decline? Shouldn't they want to revise
these rules to arrest and reverse their decline? [The logic implicit in
the argument that rising states provoke war **[contradicts common
sense]{.mark}**. With their rise, the newcomers should become more
satisfied and established powers should become more
dissatisfied.]{.underline}

Organski and Kugler's logic noted above is helpful, because it reminds
us that [rising states are not hardwired to be aggressive and
provocative. There is a reason for their dissatisfaction because they
are undercompensated]{.underline} for what their capabilities and
achievements would entitle them to. The opposite of this observation is,
of course, that [the established but declining states are
overcompensated]{.underline} in terms of various tangible or intangible
benefits that the international order extends to them. This
understanding is in turn important in suggesting that it is not the fact
that some states are rising that makes them aggressive or provocative.
It is rather the discrepancy between their capabilities and the benefits
(or recognition) that they receive from the international system that is
the source of their grievances.

If the distribution of benefits mirrors the distribution of power, no
state can credibly threaten to use force to change the status quo and
the risk of war is smallest. If, however, there is a sufficiently large
disparity between the distribution of power and benefits, the status quo
may be threatened regardless of what the underlying distribution of
power is.14

Parenthetically, the concept of revisionism is sometime deployed in a
second way to mean efforts to change the existing distribution of power
among states. When this concept is used in this way, it resorts to
definitional fiat so that all states that try to improve their
international position---and hence all rising states---are ipso facto
revisionist and a threat to the existing order. In the context of power
transition theory, this view conflates or comes close to duplicating
this theory's other variable, namely, shifting power balance to explain
systemic war. Besides, which state does not wish to increase its
influence and expand its power?

[[If Germany]{.mark} had already overtaken or w[as poised to overtake
Britain, why should its leaders not simply bide their time]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} expect to [gain mastery]{.mark} of Europe [without having
to fight a war?]{.mark} According to this logic, rising states should
let the ongoing trend be their friend and ride it to gain further
advances in their international stature]{.underline}. Declining states
should instead be more desperate as they worry about being overtaken by
latecomers. Thus, to explain Germany's decisions leading to the First
World War, some scholars have argued that it was worried about a rising
Russia that could shortly pose a threat to it, thus inclining it to
launch a preventive war before it lost its advantage.15 The key to
explaining Germany's decisions, in other words, was not its ambition to
replace Britain as the world's premier power. Rather, it was Berlin's
worry and even alarm that it was poised to decline relative to a rising
Russia (and again, relative to the USSR in the context of the Second
World War in 1941).

Conventional discourse has things wrong: war between Germany and Britain
occurred in 1914 not because the former had wanted to challenge the
latter, but because Germany's diplomacy had failed to keep Britain from
getting into a confrontation. As in the Second World War, Germany's
primary concern was about a rising Russia/USSR to its east. By
extension, if China should get into a war with the United States, it
would not be because it wants to fight the US, but rather because it has
failed to keep the US on the sidelines in a crisis involving Taiwan.
[Certainly, neither Germany in 1914 nor China today was/is interested in
establishing a new world order.]{.underline} For China, the resolution
of Taiwan's status and the cause of national reunification constitute
the highest priority in its foreign policy. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark}
both Germany in 1914 and 1938 and [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} today,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} was/[[is not world domination but]{.mark}
rather [regional mastery]{.mark} in their respective neighbourhood
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} was/[[is their priority]{.underline}]{.mark}.
After establishing its own regional hegemony in the western hemisphere,
an abiding principle of US foreign policy has been to prevent another
country from reaching the same status in Europe, east Asia or the Middle
East.

Here again, popular [[narratives]{.mark} circulating in the West,
[alleging China's ambition to displace the US]{.mark} as the global
hegemon, are **[greatly exaggerated]{.mark}**, seriously **misinformed**
and intended largely for domestic consumption.]{.underline} [[China is
not trying to take over the US' role]{.mark} in world affairs and
replace the existing order with a China-centric order. Even though
[China]{.mark} has made great progress in improving its national
capabilities, it [is]{.mark} still primarily [a regional
powe]{.mark}r]{.underline} whose military reach does not extend very far
from its borders. [[Only]{.mark} one country in the world---**[the
U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates---[is capable of invading and
occupying another country]{.mark} and fighting a long war [far away from
its home]{.mark} base.]{.underline} Although an armed clash between
China and the US is possible, it will not be over which one of them gets
to decide the international order as power transition theory suggests.
It will also not be about which country should be the global hegemon.
Rather, it will be over more tangible disputes such as Taiwan's status.
If the reader needs any reminder at all, these two countries had fought
before in Korea. That conflict happened long before there was any talk
of a rising China seeking to unseat the US from its pre-eminent
international position. Wang Jisi, a prominent Chinese scholar in
International Relations, observes that the current China--US rivalry is
driven by a set of compound causal logics. The driving factors include
the shifting balance of power, ideological and civilizational
differences, global trends and domestic politics. Among these factors,
domestic politics is probably the most crucial variable that may bring
the two countries into a conflict.16 In other words, it is not the
shifting balance of power at the systemic level but rather domestic
politics in both countries that would determine whether the two powers
would go to war. A power transition is not necessary for war to happen,
nor does a war between these two countries have to be about which one of
them should be the global hegemon.

Theoretical rationale and empirical evidence

Realists emphasize the role of power in international relations. Why do
rising latecomers that manage to catch up to the front runners threaten
peace? Balance of power is an axiomatic tenet of realism, claiming that
when there is an equal distribution of power among states, international
peace and stability tend to prevail.17 If realism stands for anything,
it stands for the proposition that states should pursue a policy of
balancing power. Much discourse on rising states, however, upends this
traditional realist view, arguing instead that when a rising state
approaches the power of an established, dominant state, peace and
stability are threatened. In short, this is the key claim advanced by
power transition theory and the idea of the Thucydides trap: namely,
that a rising China threatens not just US preponderance in international
affairs, but also global peace and stability.

[Realists who truly believe in balance of power should welcome rather
than worry about China's rise, because this development produces a
situation of more balanced power between China and the United
States.]{.underline} Yet in the current prevailing discourse,
commentators use the word 'balance' to refer to US efforts to check a
rising but still weaker China, and they point to a rising but still
weaker China seeking to balance against a preponderant US as proof of
its aggressive intention seeking to overturn the status quo---or, in
other words, as evidence that China is trying to upset the 'balance of
power'. When speaking about US policies seeking to 'balance' against a
rising China, these commentators really have in mind maintaining, even
increasing, an imbalance of power in US favour. As Waltz has observed:

[When Americans speak of preserving the balance of power in east Asia
through their military presence, the Chinese understandably take this to
mean that they intend to maintain the strategic hegemony they now enjoy
in the absence of such a balance]{.underline}.18

Again, words do not mean what they say.

Where should one look for signs of international order, and how should
one identify aggressive states that threaten international peace and
stability? A naive person may refer to the United Nations and, more
specifically, to the resolutions adopted by its General Assembly as the
best representation or reflection of an international order's norms and
rules. Yet [few Americans who write about international order turn to
this source of empirical record, perhaps because **[the US and
its]{.mark}**]{.underline} [principal western **[allies]{.mark}** are
**[regularly outvoted in the UN]{.mark}, showing that [they are the ones
who are out of step]{.mark} with the international community's
consensus**.]{.underline}19

A naive layperson may also want to know which countries have resorted
more frequently to arms when they are asked to identify the chief source
of possible threat to international order and stability. Which countries
have been involved in more wars, armed interventions, or the invasion
and occupation of other countries? Systematic evidence on this question
is readily available from sources such as the University of Michigan's
Correlates of War Project.20 [[China has not been implicated in any
effort to **overthrow**]{.mark} **foreign [governments]{.mark}** or
[engage in **unconventional warfare** or]{.mark} **extrajudicial
[killings]{.mark}** [such as **those carried out by the US**]{.mark} in
drone attacks abroad. China has also not been implicated in **[plots to
assassinate]{.mark} foreign [leaders]{.mark} such as Fidel
Castro**.]{.underline}

It might be reasonable, moreover, to look to military spending by
various major states and their record of joining international
institutions and treaties for clues to identify those countries that are
likely to be aggressive and pose a threat to international peace and
stability. Yet current discourse on revisionism and threats to
international order rarely refer to these indicators, even though the
pertinent data are readily available. In this context, we can note that
data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show
[**[US spending on]{.mark} its [armed forces]{.mark}** in 2019 as being
**[greater than the combined]{.mark} defence expenditures [of the next
ten countries]{.mark}** in the rankings, including China]{.underline}.21

One can also easily refer to systematic data indicating [which countries
have more often ratified (or abandoned) international treaties, accords
and organizations.]{.underline} For instance, we could investigate which
countries have joined or refused to join (or have withdrawn from) the
League of Nations, the International Criminal Court, the Paris climate
agreement, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the
respective Conventions to protect the rights of women and children, the
Iran nuclear deal, the international agreement banning landmines, and
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or its successor, the Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership? As the reader
may guess, those who opine on threats to world order almost never
consult such systematic evidence to support their assertions. There are
important exceptions to this generalization, but such empirical studies
based on systematic data and transparent logic are relatively rare.22

When states observe rules that limit the arbitrary use of force, respect
the sanctity of treaties, acknowledge the legitimacy of ruling elites in
other countries and refrain from infringing on each other's traditional
spheres of influence, we have a more restrictive international order
that enhances the prospects of peace and stability.23 Conversely, when
states disregard or reject these norms, we have a more permissive order
that is less likely to prevent the occurrence of wars and crises. It is
not so difficult for researchers to determine which states in recent
years have acted more in compliance with the traditional pillars of a
restrictive international order.

The implicit link between rising states and threats to the 'liberal
world order' presumes a causal claim that is very much subject to
challenge. [Much of [the]{.mark} recent [impetus to deglobalize]{.mark}
or to disengage from the liberal world order [has come from the
West]{.mark}, exemplified by **[Brexit]{.mark}** and by Donald
**[Trump]{.mark}**'s demand, during his first presidency, to renegotiate
the North American Free Trade Agreement, his [abandonment of the TPP
and]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} Agreement, and his
**[withdrawal]{.mark}** from many international **[treaties]{.mark}**
and organizations such as the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the UN Human Rights Council, and the World Health
Organization]{.underline} ( Joe Biden subsequently decided to return the
US to these three international organizations and to the Paris Climate
Agreement; however, Trump again withdrew the United States from the
Paris Accord on the first day of his presidency). [The US owes the
largest amount of its dues to the UN, even though it urges its allies to
pay more for collective defence.]{.underline} In contrast, [**[China has
now become the leading state contributing personnel to UN
peacekeeping]{.mark}** missions. President Xi Jinping has proclaimed
China's continued commitment to globalization]{.underline} and the
longstanding principles originating from Westphalia. Naturally, states
act both offensively and defensively. They all seek to defend and uphold
some international rules and norms while at the same time trying to
alter and replace other rules and norms. It is too facile to classify
states into the binary categories of defenders and challengers of the
international order.

At a meeting of top Chinese and US diplomats held in March 2021, US
Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized China, claiming that its
actions 'threaten the rules-based order that maintains global
stability'.24 [Yang Jiechi, the leader of the Chinese
delegation]{.underline}, retorted that the US 'does not have the
qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of
strength', suggesting that even many Americans have questioned the state
of democracy in their country. Yang in effect challenged Blinken to
specify which and whose rules of world order Blinken had in mind when
criticizing China, [stating that China would only follow 'the United
Nations-centered international system and the international order
underpinned by international law, not what is advocated by a small
number of countries of the so-called "rules-based" international
order']{.underline}.25

When celebrating the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of
China, President Xi stated pointedly that 'China welcomes helpful
suggestions, but will not accept sanctimonious preaching'.26 These
remarks reflect a more confident belief on the part of the Chinese
leadership and the general public that China's rise to great power
status entitles it to more respect from the rest of the world, and
especially from the West. China finds itself playing a new role shaping
the world order and enjoying a new opportunity to promote its vison of a
rejuvenated Chinese nation.

[[The definition of what the US claims to be the 'rules-based]{.mark}
international [order' is not clear]{.mark}]{.underline} and even some of
its allies and partners are confused by these claims. [China rejects
those 'rules' determined only by the US and western countries while
other countries do not have a seat at the table]{.underline}. [To the
Chinese leadership, **[such 'rules' are 'house rules', not international
rules.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian
characterizes the rules-based international order as the United States'
'house rules' to dominate the world.27 However, [China does not intend
to upend all aspects of the rules-based international
order]{.underline}. Yan Xuetong, a well-known Chinese realist scholar,
believes that China's newfound confidence does not mean that it will
challenge the US on all issues. In his view, [China will challenge the
US on some issues but limit its contestation on others.]{.underline}
China wants to compete with the US in those areas where it has
advantages.28

[**[The Chinese]{.mark}** believe that their country has
**[work]{.mark}**ed [within the]{.mark} framework and [rules]{.mark} of
the United Nations Charter, and that **[the US has little respect for
the international order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and laws underpinned by
the UN Charter, often acting unilaterally or with like-minded allies,
for example in [using military force on]{.mark} various occasions in
**[Iraq]{.mark}**, the former **[Yugoslavia]{.mark}**, [**Libya**,
**Somalia** and **Syria** without UN approva]{.mark}l. A quick review of
[the **veto**]{.mark} records [of]{.mark} the five permanent members of
the UN Security Council suggests that the US is more out of touch with
international opinion, such as in its recent **resolutions calling for
[a ceasefire in Gaza.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The nature of international order

One of the major problems in the current discourse on international
order is that its [rules and norms are never fixed]{.underline}, static
or a settled matter; they are always evolving. Moreover, [they are the
result of continuous negotiation and renegotiation.]{.underline} There
is rarely, if ever, complete consensus on these rules and norms, which
are being constantly challenged and contested. Most countries agree with
and support some of these rules and norms, while objecting to others.
Therefore, their compliance is selective and contingent. Even though
proponents of power transition theory and many US officials and scholars
try to draw a causal connection between rising powers and the disruption
or dismantlement of international order, they overlook a more
fundamental phenomenon: this order has always been buttressed by power.
The stronger states always have a dominant voice in deciding
international rules and institutions. According to Stephen Walt,
'international orders inevitably reflect the underlying balance of
power'.29

It is also important to acknowledge that Walt goes on to say that 'no
single power can write and enforce all the rules of an order'. This
being the case, the maintenance of international order requires not only
leadership from strong states but also followership from other countries
whose support of the order depends on their perception of its
legitimacy. Thus, coercion is not enough to sustain an international
order, as is sometimes implied in the current popular western discourse.
This discourse seriously distorts the fundamental realities. It also
often presents false dichotomies, suggesting that the only alternatives
are the current international order and one that is dominated by
China---or chaos or disorder. Furthermore, **[[the idea that the]{.mark}
world's two [most powerful states would go to war to fight over]{.mark}
which one of them should decide [the]{.mark} nature of [international
order is]{.mark} too facile and [far-fetched.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The idea of world order dates back to the work of Hedley Bull,30 while
John Ikenberry is more responsible for the idea of a liberal order.31
**[Ikenberry]{.underline}** originally argued that the US-dominated
liberal world order is easy to join and hard to resist, but he has
recently become more concerned about threats that may end this order.
This order has enabled China's rise. The [[challenges to liberal
internationalism come]{.mark} not only from rising non-western states,
but also---and **[even more so]{.mark}**---[from]{.mark} developments
within the **[western countries]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is being
jeopardized by [[Trumpism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its 'America First'
policy and by an agenda to push aggressively for [regime change
abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}. The naive assumption that a rising China
would be naturally incorporated into the US-dominated international
order has proved to be wrong. [Liberal democracy itself appears fragile
and polarized, vulnerable to far-right populism and backlash politics in
the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia]{.underline}. [**[The West has
lost the moral high ground]{.mark}**, for example by its [handling
of]{.mark} international [refugees]{.mark} and its protectionist
economic policies; and, in the case of the US, by Trump's supporters
s[torming the Capitol]{.mark} on 6 January 2021, Trump's [denial
of]{.mark} the integrity of the [2020]{.mark} presidential
[election]{.mark} and t[he **Black Lives Matter movement**]{.mark} which
protested [against]{.mark} pervasive **[police
brutality]{.mark}**]{.underline} [towards minorities.]{.underline}

The Biden administration claimed that the US is leading the world in
strengthening the rules-based international order while China is
violating and dismantling this order. It professed to defend this order,
but often applied double standards to itself and others. Even though
Biden proclaimed that might does not make right, as mentioned earlier
with respect to the empirical record of the historical incidence of
military assaults on various countries, [the US has resorted to force
far more frequently than China]{.underline}. Walt has argued that the
issue is not the United States' preference for a rules-based order and
China's alleged lack of interest in it; rather, in his view it is more a
question of who will determine which rules pertain where: 'The question
is who gets to write the codes---and whether the United States will live
up to its own.'32 We have questioned earlier whether such 'rules' can be
dictated by any one country, even a superpower.

[The US notion of a rules-based order does not always bring peace and
stability to the world. [From]{.mark} its 'war on terror' in [**Iraq**,
**Afghanistan** and **Libya** to]{.mark} its policies toward the former
[**Yugoslavia**, **Nicaragua** and **Cuba**, the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates h[as attempted to **overthrow more than
fifty**]{.mark} **foreign [governments]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} has **[intervened]{.mark}** to some extent [in]{.mark}
democratic [elections **in at least thirty
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[since the]{.mark} end of [the Second
World War]{.mark} even though it routinely complains about Russian,
Chinese and Iranian efforts to meddle in its political
processes.]{.underline}33 According to the Costs of War Project at Brown
University, [**[the]{.mark}** total **[death toll in the post-9/11 war
zones]{.mark} of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen** could be
**[at least 4.5]{.mark}--4.7 [million]{.mark} and is likely to be
higher,**]{.underline} although the precise mortality figure remains
unknown.34 Some of these people were killed in fighting, but far more,
especially children, have been killed by the reverberating effects of
war, such as the spread of famine, malnutrition and disease. These
'indirect deaths' were estimated to number 3.6--3.8 million, with
roughly 900,000 deaths occurring in a period of almost 20 years
following the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.35 [[This]{.mark}
record [should have]{.mark} seriously [**discredited**
**American**]{.mark} moral **[authority]{.mark}** but is rarely
acknowledged in western discourse [on the]{.mark} [**rules-based
international order**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although the international order and the international balance of power
are two distinct concepts, they are closely related to each other. Order
does not simply mean peace and stability; but, as already mentioned,
international order reflects the underlying international balance of
power. Without power, it is difficult to achieve order, at the regional
or global level---although legitimacy is also important, because
coercion alone is never enough to sustain an order over time. As US
economic power declines, international trade and monetary rules have
become increasingly strained. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the
status of the US dollar, which has dominated international currency
markets and settlement for international trade since the end of the
Second World War. 'The US share of currency reserves by central banks
\[has fallen\] from over 70% in the early 2000s to under 60% today'.36
Most of the world's oil trade is conducted in US dollars, but this
situation is changing rapidly as more and more countries are settling
their accounts in local currencies. Large amounts of global oil reserves
are under US sanctions, and this situation creates enormous pressure on
oil producers and buyers to shift away from the US dollar. The United
States' freezing of accounts held by foreigners in its banking
institutions and its frequent and blatant resort to SWIFT (the Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) to impose economic
sanctions and financial blockades against regimes that it dislikes have
caused its actual and potential targets to seek alternative institutions
and currencies to conduct their transactions. In these and other ways
(such as the delinking of the dollar from gold, or the invasion of Iraq
without UN approval), ironically what other countries---including US
allies---'really want is for the United States to take its oft-repeated
commitment to a "rules-based" order more seriously'.37

To give one example, the United States has blocked Chinese companies
such as Huawei from accessing its market and technology, and it has also
lobbied other countries to ban Chinese telecommunications firms from
participating in their 5G networks. US officials and legislators have
claimed that certain Chinese-owned social media companies with a
presence in the US market can conduct espionage and disclose their
American users' confidential information to the Chinese government. Most
recently, in 2024 the US Congress passed a law providing for the
video-sharing platform TikTok to be banned in the US unless it divests
itself from its parent company, ByteDance.38 That these claims are made
by the US is often viewed as ironic, given that in  2019 the German
federal minister for economic affairs and energy, Peter Altmaier,
reiterated claims that US intelligence services had surreptitiously
recorded Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone conversations in 2015, and
he stated that 'the US also requires its companies to provide certain
information needed to fight terrorism'.39 In 2013 Edward Snowden
disclosed that surveillance was conducted on a massive scale by the
National Security Agency with the cooperation of US telecommunication
companies and European governments.40

Conclusion

Scholarship often follows changes in official policy, reflecting the
twists and turns in states' changing official relations. For example,
Wilhelmine Germany was once held by many Americans, including the then
future president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, as a paragon of
bureaucratic efficiency, a model of constitutional monarchy, and an
example par excellence of the rule of law. But as the First World War
approached, Americans' image (held by scholars, officials and the mass
public alike) changed abruptly to depict German leaders as Teutonic
warlords bent on aggrandizement and destruction.41 This major and swift
change demonstrates how quickly elite---and scholarly---consensus can
break down and transform. One may also recall the days of 'panda mania'
following President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to Beijing, and the days
when the US and China were practically strategic allies in their
opposition to the USSR during the Nixon, Ford and Carter
administrations.

A moment's reflection tells us that since those days [China has not
pursued a more belligerent foreign policy and that its society and
economy have become more open]{.underline}. Indeed, if the objective of
US policy on engaging China is to integrate China in the international
community, it has largely succeeded. [[**China** is]{.mark} today deeply
[**embedded** in the **global** **econom**]{.mark}**y**, and it is **[an
active participant in international organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and multilateral diplomacy]{.underline} (compared to the Maoist era,
when China espoused the doctrine of proletarian revolution, supported
insurgency movements abroad, denounced the UN and other
western-dominated institutions, and rejected international agreements to
control nuclear arms). [One may therefore be confused by the evolution
of elite and mass opinion in the West, depicting a more assertive---even
aggressive---China in recent years.42 China was much more isolated and
bellicose during the Maoist years]{.underline} that predated its recent
rise. Its policies and conduct have since become more moderate. For
example, **[[as it becomes stronger, China has less frequently resorted
to coercion in]{.mark} its [sovereignty disputes]{.mark} in the South
China Sea]{.underline}**.43 [This]{.underline} phenomenon [contradicts
the suggestion that as China gains more power, it has become more
aggressive.]{.underline}

Certainly, [**China has resorted to military and economic**
coercion]{.underline} against Taiwan. [**But [has this coercion been
more egregious than]{.mark}** aspects of US conduct in recent decades,
such as **i[nvading Grenada and Iraq]{.mark}**[, **deposing**]{.mark}
foreign leaders such as Panama's Manuel **[Noriega]{.mark}**, and mining
Nicaragua's ports? Why should China care less about the geostrategic
importance of Taiwan than [the]{.mark} US did about
**[Cuba]{.mark}**?]{.underline} [Recall the US naval
**[blockade]{.mark}** of that island and its threat in 1962 to escalate
the missile crisis **to the brink of nuclear war. [We have not seen
similar behaviour by China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least not for
almost three-quarters of a century since the establishment of the
People's Republic. China has been patient. One can of course argue that
this patience has been due to its lack of capabilities thus far, and
that therefore the jury is still out. But the same logic would argue
that when a state with the relevant capabilities has used them in
attacking various other countries as the US has done, the jury seems to
have spoken.

Relations between the US and Cuba are fundamentally different from those
between China and Taiwan, which are a legacy of their unfinished civil
war. Taiwan continues to exist as a self-governing entity because of US
protection. In 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War,
President Harry S. Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet of the US Navy to
intervene in the Taiwan Strait to prevent a communist takeover of
Taiwan. Had it not been for this intervention and continued US support
since then, Taiwan would have been reunited with China. The US of course
also had its own civil war, which was settled by bullets rather than by
the ballots. As Buzan and Cox remark:

Parallels could in fact be drawn between the ruthless military
anti-secessionism and rejection of self-determination that underpinned
the US civil war, and China's similar current attitudes towards Tibet,
Taiwan, and Xinjiang. Abraham Lincoln and the Chinese Communist Party
would perhaps have understood each other quite well on this question.
The United States has been more fortunate in that its unity question was
largely laid to rest after the Civil War, and did not much affect its
peaceful rise. For China, the unity question is still not fully
resolved, especially over Tibet and Taiwan. It plays significantly into
China's international image, and therefore into its wider foreign policy
and IR \[International Relations\].44

US Senator Frank Church from Idaho stated at a hearing on the Vietnam
War:

... had England, which favored the South, adhered to the same principle
that now seems to govern American policy, and had sent troops in the
name of self-determination into the Confederacy, I think the English
Government would have been hard put to convince Abraham Lincoln that
there should be an election to determine the ultimate outcome of the
war.45

In 1971 Gramsci wrote about the power of ideas in maintaining and
perpetuating the rule of the dominant class over the underclass.46 To
the extent that the ideas propagated by the elites are accepted and
internalized by the masses, the underprivileged (such as slaves) come to
view their life conditions and fate as inevitable, natural and even
legitimate. There are few instances in systematic scholarship inquiring
about how and why the Kaiserreich and Imperial Japan's policies of
colonial conquest and foreign expansion, and their armament programmes,
were different from or more egregious than those pursued by their
predecessors or contemporaries---other great powers such as Britain,
France, Russia and the US. Indeed, Germany's territorial acquisitions
before 1914 look puny when compared to those of the United States.

Current narratives that cast the US in the role of a defender of the
status quo--- presumably the existing international order, even though
this order is always in flux and being negotiated and
renegotiated47---and China in the role of a challenger to this order
testify to the enormous wealth of soft power commanded by the US.48 This
power seeks to perpetuate the dominant positions of the established
states without, however, answering the question why the status quo is
necessarily conducive to stability, justice or fairness. [Rarely does
one hear that]{.underline} some practices, such as **[[racism and
colonialism, were]{.underline}]{.mark}** once [**widely [accepted
norms]{.mark} of the prevailing order**]{.underline} which current
western narratives tend to sanctify. For instance, [**[the]{.mark}**
victorious **[allies meeting]{.mark} at Versailles** after the First
World War **[refused to recognize]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the principles
of **[equality among races]{.mark}**]{.underline} and states. [**[Should
those who call for overthrowing racism]{.mark}**, colonialism,
apartheid]{.underline} and other injustices---or, for that matter, those
who introduced new principles such as crimes against peace and humanity
at Nuremberg after the Second World War and the idea of the
Responsibility to Protect more recently---[**[be labelled]{.mark} as
'[revisionists']{.mark}** and criticized for trying to upend the
existing international rules and norms?]{.underline}

### General---West revisionist

Twenty months on, [[**Israel has flattened Gaza**, **bombed**]{.mark}
swathes of [**Lebanon**, **seized**]{.mark} further [**territory
in Syria**, and]{.mark} now **[launched a]{.mark} direct [attack
on Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it pursues what it describes as an
"existential" fight against the Islamic Republic and its allies in the
region. 

Throughout the fighting, i[ts ultra-nationalist leaders have dismissed
the mounting evidence of war crimes]{.underline} committed [in
Gaza]{.underline}, which led the International Criminal Court to issue
an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in November
2024.  

Senior [[cabinet members have]{.mark} openly
[advocated]{.mark}]{.underline} the forced removal of Gaza's population,
which would amount to a [**[genocid]{.mark}**al crime]{.underline}, and
the [dismemberment of Syria.]{.underline}
[[Netanyahu]{.underline}]{.mark} himself h[as [discussed]{.mark} the
possibility of assassinating Iran's head of state and precipitating
"**[regime change]{.mark}**"]{.underline} in the Islamic Republic in
interviews with US media. 

Ironically, such rhetoric brings Israel closer in line with the
inflammatory bluster typical of its arch-foe Iran -- with the important
difference that Israel does possess nuclear weapons and a military
capable of backing up its increasingly provocative statements. 

[The extraordinary escalation is a "natural consequence of the impunity
that has prevailed in the region over the past two years]{.underline}\",
says H. A. Hellyer, a senior research fellow at the Royal United
Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) in London. 

"[The fact **[that Israel has faced no consequence for repeatedly
infringing i]{.mark}nternational [law sends a]{.mark} very [clear
signa]{.mark}l**: that if it chooses to do more, it can,]{.underline}"
he explains. "[And i**t can count on the most powerful actors** in the
international community simply not doing very much or actually
**empowering** and emboldening **it**." ]{.underline}

The most immediate consequence of Israeli impunity in the Middle East is
the immense suffering inflicted on civilian populations, nowhere more so
than in Gaza, where Israel's ongoing military campaign has killed more
55,000 people, according to local health officials, and rendered the
narrow strip of land largely uninhabitable. 

[A]{.underline}nother [consequence]{.underline}, with more far-reaching
implications, i[s the further **[erosion of the rules-based
order]{.mark}** in place since World War II, says Karim Emile
**Bitar**, a Middle East expert at Beirut's Saint-Joseph University and
visiting **professor at Sciences-Po Paris.** ]{.underline}

["**Recent events have driven [the final nail into the coffin of
i]{.mark}nternational [law and]{.mark}** of what has been referred to as
**[the l]{.mark}**iberal **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[o]{.mark}**rder,"]{.underline} he says. "[The message to the world is
that if might is on your side, **[you can break all the rules]{.mark}**,
trample on international law and all the standards that have been in
place since 1945, and **[there will be]{.mark} absolutely [no
accountability]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

'A new Middle East' 

Netanyahu has described Israel's actions as ushering in a "new Middle
East", a phrase that has haunted the region at least since the 2003 Iraq
War, when the US and its allies sought to remodel it -- with
catastrophic consequences.  

"There has been a lot of jubilation (among critics of Iran), imagining
that these are the 'birth pangs' of some sort of new Middle East. On the
contrary, this is a spiral of violence, fostered by an environment of
impunity that allows for vigilante action to take place without
repercussions," says Hellyer. 

"Nobody needs to be a fan of the Iranian regime, or Hezbollah or Hamas,
to see that this activity is incredibly destabilising for regional order
and security," he adds. "It also has massive repercussions for
international order and international security, because it means that
**[[there isn\'t a rules-based order at all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
becomes the law of the jungle. And that should be quite concerning to
all of us." 

Bitar notes that few people in the Sunni Arab world will be "shedding a
tear" for the Iranian regime -- "and for good reason, given the
disruption and suffering caused by Tehran's regional proxies\".  

However, he adds, "they are also alarmed by an increasingly unbridled
Israel, which -- unlike Iran -- has the means to wipe out entire cities,
and whose senior ministers now openly advocate ethnic cleansing in
Gaza\". 

An immediate consequence is likely to be a regional arms race to try to
narrow the gap with Israel. In Iran's case, analysts point to the
likelihood of a fresh push to go nuclear, thereby achieving the exact
opposite of the stated goal of Israel's military operation. 

"Israel\'s attack is making Iran feel very vulnerable. Their
conventional deterrence has failed, and I think we're going to see more
and more calls from within the country to pursue nuclear weapons," says
D[aryl Kimball of the US-based Arms Control Association]{.underline},
noting that contrary to Israeli claims, Western intelligence
assessments have so far concluded that Tehran is not currently pushing
to militarise its nuclear programme.

Kimball says there are already voices in Iran calling for the country to
withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which prohibits
states that don't have nuclear weapons from pursuing them. 

["Bombing (Iran) simply makes sure they will try a hundred times more
because they will assess there is no rules-based order, there is simply
the threat of force and mutually assured destruction]{.underline}," adds
Hellyer. 

'Anticipatory' self-defence 

[The phrase "birth pangs of a new Middle East" was famously used by
former US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice to refer to the 2006
Israel-Hezbollah war, one of many conflicts with roots in the regional
upheaval caused by the US invasion of Iraq.  ]{.underline}

"[Back then, there was at least a stated aim to promote democracy and
human rights in the region, even if it was largely a
smokescreen]{.underline}," says Bitar. "[Now there is no such
pretence.]{.underline} We're back to Bismarckian power politics, in
which might precedes right, and [a world governed by nationalist
authoritarian leaders]{.underline} in the mould of Putin and Trump."   

In the present climate, he adds, "**[the dwindling number of [people who
talk about respect for i]{.mark}nternational [law are]{.mark} regarded
as [hopeless idealists disconnected from
reality]{.mark}\".]{.underline}** 

While Israel's attack on Iran has drawn condemnation around the world,
the messaging from Western leaders has been far more mixed, with talk of
Israel's "right to defend itself" often taking precedence over
references to international law. 

Hours after Israel launched the first wave of attacks, French
President Emmanuel **[Macron]{.underline}**, whose planned summit on a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was scuttled by
the outbreak of war, [put the blame squarely on Iran and said France
stood ready to defend Israel]{.underline} if necessary. 

**[Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz]{.underline}** [went]{.underline}
a step [further]{.underline}, [arguing that Israel was "doing the dirty
job for all of us" by taking on in the Iranian regime]{.underline} --
prompting outcry in a country where the emphasis is normally on
de-escalation.  

In an op-ed published by the Guardian, [Sydney-based international law
professor Ben Saul argued that support for Israel's "right to
self-defence\" had no legal grounding in the present conflict and set a
dangerous precedent. ]{.underline}

He described Israel's attack on Iran as "part of a pattern of unlawful
'anticipatory' violence against other countries", along with its recent
destruction of Syrian military bases and equipment, despite "the absence
of any attack by the new Syrian authorities on Israel". 

"The risk of abuse of 'anticipatory' self-defence is simply too great,
and too dangerous, for the world to tolerate," Saul wrote, noting
that Russia claimed to invade Ukraine "in part because it speculatively
feared NATO expansion". He added: "Many countries have hostile relations
with other countries. Allowing each country to unilaterally decide when
they wish to degrade another country's military, even when they have not
been attacked, is a recipe for global chaos -- and for the unjustified
deaths of many innocent people." 

'One pillar of the post-war order is attacking another' 

In an interview with Middle East Eye, Sir Richard Dalton, a former
British ambassador to Tehran, noted that past US administrations had
refused to countenance a large-scale Israeli attack on Iran, but that
Netanyahu "has obtained more leverage over the US (since Donald Trump's
return to power) and Israel is more of a law unto itself". 

Dalton said other [Western countries had been "incredibly limp in not
holding Israel to account]{.underline}" for its conduct over the past 20
months, [a stance he attributed in part to their growing disregard for
international law. ]{.underline}

["They don't look at the legal issue. They won't look at the
circumstances in international law when a pre-emptive strike against a
potential enemy is lawful and when it is not," he said. "Israel's strike
was an illegal aggression. But we're prepared to talk frankly in those
terms about Russia but not about Israel." ]{.underline}

While Western powers have failed to rein in the violence, the
institutions they helped found decades ago to uphold the rules-based
order have not sat idle.  

Since the start of the Gaza war, both [the **[ICC]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
the]{.underline} International Court of
Justice (**[[ICJ]{.underline}]{.mark}**) have moved with urgency, the
latter issuing successive rulings last year to warn of the risk of
genocide in Gaza and order an end to Israel's military operations in the
south of the enclave. [[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark} court, however,
[[has the capacity to enforce]{.mark} international law [if]{.mark}
[world powers refuse]{.mark} to comply. ]{.underline}

[When the ICC issued its arrest warrant for Netanyahu, former US
president Joe Biden described the move as "outrageous". His successor at
the White House has gone a step further, issuing an executive order in
January to authorise sanctions on the court]{.underline} over its
"illegitimate" actions against the US and its "close ally Israel". 

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[withdrawn]{.mark} the US [from]{.mark}
several [UN bodies]{.mark} and slashed the organisation's
funding]{.underline}, creating a situation in which "one pillar of the
post-war order is attacking another", according to Brian Brivati,
visiting professor of contemporary history and human rights at Kingston
University. 

"The leading founder of the UN is now undermining the institution from
within, wielding its security council veto to block action while
simultaneously starving the organisation of resources," Brivati wrote on
The Conversation earlier this week. 

"[The combination of a powerful state acting with impunity and a
superpower]{.underline} ~~disabling~~ [\[breaking\] the mechanisms of
accountability marks [a global inflection point]{.mark},]{.underline}"
he added. "Other global powers, including Russia and China, are taking
this opportunity to move beyond the Western rules-based system."

Identity, Insecurity, and China's Place in the World

[[China's view of]{.underline}]{.mark}, and future place in, [the
[international order are]{.mark} importantly [connected to]{.mark} its
experiences during the [Century of Humiliation]{.mark} and the dual
concepts of national humiliation and national rejuvenation]{.underline}
that constitute its self-understanding. The Century of Humiliation began
with the first Opium War in 1839, when Britain forced China to open its
ports to the opium trade, and did not end until the success of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the civil war of 1949. During this
time, China was the target of repeated international interventions, lost
large pieces of its territory to Western powers and Japan, saw the
collapse of its millennia old imperial system, and was torn apart by
internal uprisings.44 According to the national humiliation narrative,
the first Opium War represents a distinct turning point in Chinese
history, when a powerful and successful ancient civilization was forced
into a semi-colonial position at the hands of foreign interventions.
[National humiliation is an [active part of contemporary]{.mark} Chinese
collective [identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It serves as an [important
resource for]{.mark} those cultivating Chinese [nationalism]{.mark},
unifying the Chinese people against foreign others who perpetrated these
past humiliations [and **legitimating the CCP**]{.mark}]{.underline},
the party seen as leading China's reemergence as a major power.

[The Century of Humiliation]{.underline}, however, is not just about
recounting a particular interpretation of the past. Rather, it [actively
informs beliefs about how the world works and is used to interpret the
dynamics of international relations today]{.underline}.45 Specifically,
the national humiliation narrative constructs China's self-understanding
and its place in the international system, shaping its interests and
aspirations as a rising power. First, [the narrative of national
humiliation represents China as a victim of Western
subjugation]{.underline}. When articulated in the context of current
international relations, [this representation works to breed suspicion
of outside actors]{.underline}, including the United States, and gives
an emotional valence to seemingly inconsequential interactions. For
example, in 2001 a US spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over
the South China Sea, sparking an international incident and inflaming
tensions between China and the United States. As the incident played
itself out, it became apparent that "[resolving this problem did not
involve military retaliation or economic reparations so much as symbolic
recognition: China demanded]{.underline} a public [apology from the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates."46 Thus, understood through
the prism of national humiliation, [interactions with the West are
always contextualized in a history where China suffered humiliating
losses at the hands of Western expansion]{.underline}, and where Western
power is, in and of itself, the instrument of that subjugation.

[Second, the narrative of national humiliation constructs]{.underline}
Chinese understandings of its military power and that of the United
States by imposing [a moral subtext to power politics]{.underline}.
Building from its treatment during the Century of Humiliation, [the
[international community's actions toward China are viewed as
unjust]{.mark}, reinforcing suspicion of foreign powers'
intentions]{.underline}.47 [[Within]{.mark} this frame, a self--Other
dynamic is created]{.underline}, whereby Chinese history is reimagined
as one of benevolent hegemony, when China governed and projected its
influence in peaceful ways. This is [positioned in contrast
to]{.underline} the use of force and coercion common to **[[Western
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Today these self--Other representations
guide Chinese understandings about the purpose and meaning of Chinese
and American power. In China's eyes, its burgeoning military power is
consistent with its history and thus is not threatening. These
representations are at work in Chinese rhetoric that characterizes its
growing power as its "peaceful rise." As Zheng Bijan argued, China's
rise will be different than that of previous major powers, as "China
will transcend ideological differences to strive for peace, development,
and cooperation with all countries of the world."48 At the same time, US
foreign policy is contextualized within this narrative by reference to
Western aggression during the Century of Humiliation. Since the end of
the Cold War, the United States has more forcefully criticized China's
human rights record, undermined its bid to host the 2000 Olympics,
increased arms sales to Taiwan, and strengthened its presence in the
region.49 While US foreign policy has been couched in the language of
engagement, many in China view this as a simple euphemism for
containment.50 This is especially the case with the Obama
administration's recent "strategic rebalancing," known popularly as the
"pivot to Asia." As a consequence, [[any attempt]{.mark} by the United
States [to]{.mark} contain or [limit Chinese power is seen as]{.mark} an
act of [misrecognition]{.mark} and an unjust and aggressive attempt to
subjugate China once again]{.underline}.

Finally, [the narrative of national humiliation highlights China's
"historical experience with territorial loss and
intrusion,"]{.underline} thus [placing]{.underline} the maintenance of
[sovereignty at the center of China's national identity]{.underline}.51
The Century of Humiliation is understood to be representative of a loss
of sovereignty, where outside forces were able to expose the state's
weakness and delegitimize its institutions. Therefore, [any perceived
infringement of China's sovereignty is read through the lens of
[national humiliation]{.mark} and [understood to be an **existential
threat**]{.mark} to China's security]{.underline}. Importantly,
[these]{.underline} threats are not material in nature, for China's
physical security is not in doubt. Rather, they [[represent a **symbolic
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [suggesting that China continues to be
vulnerable to outside influence]{.underline}. Moreover, sovereignty is
the cornerstone of the current international order. Thus any perceived
violation of sovereignty is understood to be another subjugation of
China, refusing it the rights and privileges that other states in the
system enjoy.

[This narrative of national humiliation operates alongside the goal of
national rejuvenation]{.underline}, [which provides the motivation for
China's contemporary foreign policy interests]{.underline}. If national
humiliation recounts the losses China suffered at the hands of the West
and Japan, [[national rejuvenation promises to
**restore**]{.underline}]{.mark} for China the
**[[status]{.underline}]{.mark}** [it lost during the Century of
Humiliation]{.underline}. In articulating China's self-understanding in
these terms, [China's major power status is understood as a right:
respect that China should regain by virtue of its former status as a
great nation]{.underline}.52 Thus, China's rise to major power status is
not about obtaining something new or a gaining an advantage over others,
but rather as a "restoration of fairness."53 [These discourses of
humiliation and rejuvenation infuse Chinese foreign policy, shaping a
range of behaviors]{.underline} from its voting record in the United
Nations Security Council to its regional relationships to its burgeoning
leadership role in the global economy.

Constructing China's (Un)Peaceful Rise

[[China's rise]{.underline}]{.mark}, guided by the twin narratives of
national humiliation and rejuvenation, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
**[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [What this means for the
international order will be a function of China's interactions with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and the representations that
animate that relationship. US foreign policy toward a rising China is
often cast as a choice between engagement and containment. So-called
"optimists" call for increased engagement by integrating China deeply
into the global economy and institutional architecture of the
international order, whereas "pessimists" see future security
competition as an inevitable outgrowth of Chinese power and advocate a
policy of containment.54 [Both containment and engagement]{.underline}
strategies, however, are built off of assumptions about China's material
needs and do not pay sufficient attention to China's distinct identity
needs. Thus, both approaches [risk exacerbating China's dilemma of
social insecurity, and constructing China's unpeaceful
rise]{.underline}.

Proponents of containment do not have a sanguine view of China's rise
and argue that as China grows more powerful it is likely to lead to an
intense security competition with the United States.55 Containment is a
straightforward application of realist understandings of international
politics, and presumes that under all conditions China will seek to
overturn the international order and thus its power must be preemptively
checked. China is motivated, as are all emerging major powers, by
security and the related desire for power. In this view, the anarchic
structure of international system forces states seeking only security to
behave aggressively toward one another in an attempt to gain more power
and alter the international status quo. Rising powers are revisionist
powers.56 China's economic power and influence will be the springboard
for military dominance in the region because economic power is the basis
of military power. China is building a blue-water navy that will allow
it to project naval power well beyond the Chinese coast "from the oil
ports of the Middle East to the shipping lanes of the Pacific, where the
United States Navy has long reigned as the dominant force."57 Moreover,
China's integration in regional politics is indicative of its growing
influence. As it becomes less susceptible to American economic pressure,
China will have increasing leverage over weaker Asian countries and the
United States.58 In short, while China is not in a position to
militarily challenge the United States at the present, a much more
powerful China should be expected to take increasing steps to push the
United States out of the Asia--Pacific region and challenge the terms of
the US-led international order.59 Therefore, US foreign policy must be
reoriented to contain the impending threat that China poses to the
United States' security and economic interests.

[[Containment]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is based on the **faulty
assumption**]{.underline} [that China harbors **revisionist**
intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is not an impartial assessment of
actual Chinese objectives and therefore runs a real risk of [producing
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.underline}**]{.mark}.60 [[The more]{.mark} militarily
[aggressively the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited

[[The Arctic]{.mark} Policy [White Paper identifies China as a
'responsible]{.mark} great [power']{.mark}]{.underline} (*fuzeren de
daguo*) -- an identity that some scholars think China should also assume
in the Arctic (Sun and Wang 2014a; Xiao 2019; Yang 2018). The underlying
implication is [that]{.underline} [in dealing with its Arctic partners,
China [not only]{.mark} acts [out of]{.mark} its own
[self-interest]{.mark} but also considers **common** or even **[global
interests]{.mark}**, especially in contributing to **Arctic
governance**.]{.underline} Indeed, this sentiment is apparent when some
scholars describe China as the 'international public goods provider'
(*guoji gongongpin tigongzhe*) [by sharing costs for public goods
[like]{.mark} **[environmental protection]{.mark}** -- which could
increase the trust of Arctic countries and indigenous
peoples]{.underline} in the short term, ease or even eliminate suspicion
of China and improve China's influence on governance in the Arctic in
the long run (Ding and Zhao 2014). [[China]{.mark}'s responsibleness
also implies that **the country [is not a revisionist force]{.mark}**;
this is **made** **explicit** by its **[self-identifying as a
'constructive status quo state']{.mark}**]{.underline} (*jianshexing de
xianzhuangxing guojia*); [dialectically uniting several]{.underline}
binary opposing [roles as a **participator** and a **constructor**, as
[a **law-abider and law-maker**]{.mark}, and as a responder and leader;
and setting the example of **a responsible power.**]{.underline}

Both academics and policymakers have recognised China's agency in
forming its Arctic identity (Ding and Zhang 2016, 51--58). Possessing
several regional identities is seen as a strength because 'identity
appears based on similar interests, and in practice changes with
interaction, and the change of identity, in turn, reflecting on the
interests' (Guo and Sun 2013, 136). In contrast to previous scholarship
that viewed identity construction merely as China's policy instrument
(Brady 2017; Kossa 2024), it can be said that China's identities are the
result of an academic debate on the country's role in the Arctic. Both
the near-Arctic state and Arctic stakeholder identities -- which were
selected to become official policy -- reflect China's dialectical
thinking seeking to simultaneously pursue different logics of Arctic
belonging -- determined on the one hand by obtaining geographical facts
and, on the other hand, by underscoring China's interests and even the
interests of humanity as a whole.

*International Relations in the Arctic: Between Cooperation and
Competition*

[Academic d[iscussions of **China's Arctic policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}
privilege the study of China's strategy and intentions in the Arctic, so
the literature [has [focused on]{.mark}]{.underline} explaining the
discrepancy between China's use of [[**cooperative** and **competitive**
**frames**]{.mark} regarding the Arctic]{.underline}. China's Arctic
policy (2018) is notably silent on competition and conflicts in the
Arctic. [Some]{.underline} explanations [characterise]{.underline}
[this]{.underline} discrepancy [as a 'tactic]{.underline}' and China's
engagement as 'cautious', with the country trying to 'build partnerships
and neutralise hostile forces' (Brady 2017, 226). Other explanations
attribute this contrast to differences in strategic assessments of
China's interests by various actors, such as state and non-state actors
(Kossa 2020). [However]{.underline}, this section argues that
[[China's]{.mark} scholars and [policymakers view]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations
**[dialectically]{.mark}** -- [as a **balance**]{.mark} between
cooperation and competition]{.underline}. From the outset, Chinese
scholars focused on identifying constantly changing sources of
cooperation and competition, and this trend was reinforced only by
shocks, such as the war in Ukraine.

[Exploratory]{.underline} keyness [[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
academic articles [[revealed]{.mark} keywords that refer to [ideas of
**cooperation**]{.mark} (*guoji hezuo*) and **[win -- win]{.mark}**
(*hezuo gongying*), as well as]{.underline} ideas of competition (*beiji
zhengduozhan*) and [**[solving disagreements]{.mark}** (*gezhi
zhengy*i)]{.underline}. Having parsed the keywords of *hezuo*,
*gongying*, *zhengduo* and *zhengyi* as terms for further study, lexical
search yielded the following results, summarised in Figure 2, as the
percentage of articles that mention these terms by year. Seen together,
both cooperation and competition are in a dialectical relationship, with
**[up to [90% of all documents mention]{.mark}ing
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** and up to 70% mentioning competition
**[in recent years]{.underline}**. Despite some fluctuations,
[consistently **[more documents mention coop]{.mark}eration [than
competition]{.mark}** -- a trend that has remained **[unchanged in the
face of]{.mark} geopolitical [crises]{.mark}** [like]{.mark} the
**[Ukraine]{.mark} War.**]{.underline}

As the qualitative assessment of these themes reveals, the logic of
conflict and cooperation in the Arctic is a point of discursive
contestation. On the one hand, there is competition between Arctic and
non-Arctic states, where the former attempt to preserve their
stewardship over the Arctic, while the latter attempt to achieve a say
in Arctic affairs. On the other hand, scholars highlight competition
between Arctic states, especially between Russia and the other Arctic
states, but also disagreements over other issues, such as the maritime
dispute over the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone or the now-resolved
territorial dispute between Canada and Denmark over Hans Island.
Similarly, cooperation is conceptualised as either a process between
Arctic states or between the Arctic states and China. Thus, reconciling
the contradiction between cooperation and competition requires finding a
balance that is not fixed and depends on the actors in question.

First, representations of competition introduced a scramble, a
semiorganised competitive division of exclusive and finite resources
overseen by the exclusive circle of Arctic states. Cooperation was thus
subjugated to competitive logic -- a compromise necessary to achieve a
more desirable distribution of resources. This representation was in
line with [**[realist]{.mark}** literature]{.underline}, which
[emphasised the role of great power politics and geopolitics in the
Arctic and held that nation-states prioritise their national
interests,]{.underline} pursuing common or global interests only if
these align with national interests. Furthermore, it was argued [that
China is competing with great powers like the United States, Russia,
Europe and Japan]{.underline}, and in the specific context of the
Arctic, 'great powers fully use their strategic advantage of their
Arctic position, conducting a layered, three-dimensional scramble from
ground, air, and ice' (Lu 2010, 22). At the same time, the goal of
cooperation between Arctic states was seen as excluding (*paichi*)
non-Arctic states.

[Geopolitical analyses have [emphasised]{.mark} the region's importance
in [the 'fight for hegemony]{.mark}' between great powers, underscoring
that 'controlling the region allows effectively restraining other great
powers']{.underline} (Xu and Wu 2007, 21) and that many countries are
already paying more attention to it (Lu 2010, 21). Some [authors have
considered the potential for armed conflict **[in the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially between Russia and NATO (Cheng
2010; Lu 2010; Lu and Zhang 2016; Yang 2015; Zhang and Yang 2013). Some
even claim that, having lost its European sphere of influence, Russia's
new geopolitical strategy is to 'occupy' a part of the Arctic Ocean
(Cheng 2010) and that there is a high possibility of armed conflict
between Russia and NATO (Wang 2018). More cautious pessimists have noted
that Arctic geopolitics is a complex issue, leaving some room for
cooperation, even though military considerations will ultimately
determine whether a conflict erupts (Lu 2010).

[**[In contrast]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [the institutionalist outlook
presented the cooperative element with an optimistic vision of
the]{.underline} international situation in the [Arctic]{.underline}.
The 2010 Delimitation Treaty between Norway and Russia weakened the
argument that the disputes in the Arctic were poised to escalate into
armed conflict and supported the argument that the Arctic can be an
'area of peace and stability', maintaining 'peace and cooperation in the
Northern hemisphere, benefitting all humanity' (Kuang 2011, 52). Some
have emphasised that the [Arctic countries are in no position to
dominate Arctic affairs completely, and that there is generally more
cooperation than conflict, as the globalisation of Arctic affairs is
unfolding on many levels]{.underline} (government, non-governmental
organisations and indigenous peoples) and China should take part in all
of them (An and Chen 2011). [**[China's role]{.mark} in the Arctic**
[is]{.mark} **seen** [**not** simply]{.mark} as **furthering [national
interest]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} as **[a moral obligation]{.mark}**, with
the responsibility [to ensure **environmental protection** in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pan and Xia 2011) [[and to **represent**
**developing countries**]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline} (An and Chen
2011). Some held that China's position as a latecomer to Arctic
governance would be greatly improved by multi-level international
diplomacy and that respecting the legitimate rights and interests of the
Arctic countries could help fulfil China's strategic interests in the
Arctic (Ding and Zhang 2016; He and Song 2013). Some analysts have
introduced a distinction between the areas where cooperation is likely
and possible and those domains where cooperation is not possible,
arguing that there is a difference between non-zero-sum games, such as
the development of natural resources, and zero-sum games, such as
military security (Xia and Su 2013).

The Ukrainian crisis of 2014 (*Wukelan weiji*) began a round of
discussions about the synthesis of conflict and cooperation in the
Arctic. Chinese realist scholars have posited that the Ukrainian crisis
would lead to the deterioration of the international situation in the
Arctic. In contrast, institutionalists and constructivists noted how
Arctic cooperation had demonstrated resilience to external crises,
'developing in the direction of peace and cooperation', as the 2014
crisis had not changed 'the interests and policy goals of the three
major subjects of Arctic affairs' (Zhao and Ou 2016, 42). Drawing on the
theory of Arctic exceptionalism (Deng 2020, 164), these scholars hold
that the Arctic will manage to maintain 'high latitudes and low
conflict' (*gaoweidu, dichongtu*) -- or that the United States and
Russia are engaging in 'low-level cooperation and high-intensity
confrontation' at the same time.

US Secretary of State Michael [**[Pompeo]{.mark}**'s]{.underline} (2019,
para. 29--32) [comments [singled out 'China's]{.mark} pattern of
[aggressive behaviour]{.mark}']{.underline} as threatening [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Scholars]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
increasingly [described **an Arctic security dilemma**]{.underline}
(*anquan kunjing*), in which NATO's presence has given rise to Russian
suspicions, while Russia's continuous development and deployment of
offensive weapons is deemed threatening. A few scholars (Wang 2021;
Zhang and Wang 2019) have mentioned the possibility of a resource war or
other Arctic-driven conflict but most noted instead how exogenous
conflicts spill over to the Arctic. As Deng (2020) put it, 'When Russia
and the United States conflict at the system level, the unique
geographical endowment and strategic value of the Arctic region make it
an incremental area for the two countries to enhance their global
strategic deterrence and a frontier for strategic confrontation' (164).

[The Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} in 2022 triggered a new
dialectical cycle in Chinese Arctic discourse as institutionalist
arguments about cooperation were abruptly weakened. [China found itself
caught in the crossfire]{.underline} of a fragmented governance
structure where 'confrontation and dialogue co-exist', with a rapidly
diminishing role open to non-Arctic states (Y. Xiao 2022). Realist
analysts have reasserted that the likelihood of conflict is increasing
as the Arctic ice buffer between Russia and NATO disappears. They argued
that the United States provoked Russian aggression by interfering in its
sphere of influence to strengthen NATO's cohesion, urging China and
Russia to prepare for encirclement by US allies in Europe, the Arctic
and the Asia-Pacific (Xie and Du 2022; Zhao and Jiang 2022).

[**[Overall]{.mark}**, optimism and **[belief in cooperation]{.mark}
have [persisted]{.mark}** [despite]{.mark} the growing
[**uncertainties** and **changing international situation in the
Arctic**]{.mark} following Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} (Li
and Chen 2022). Some [**[Chinese scholars]{.mark}** have noted that the
crisis has affected the Arctic governance mechanism]{.underline},
scientific activities, cooperation and economic development and
heightened pressure on climate and environmental protection. [However,
they [believe]{.mark} that in the longer term, **['international
coop]{.mark}**eration is [the only way to deal with challenges in the
Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}, [and Arctic cooperation and dialogue
will continue to move forward **despite twists and turns'**]{.underline}
(Chen et al. 2022, 20). Although the China Ocean Shipping Company paused
all operations on the Northern Sea Route, [the **[Chinese
academic]{.mark}** community **[still]{.mark}** [discusses]{.mark} the
[potential for economic and energy connectivity between Europe and
China]{.mark} in connection with a Polar Silk Road despite risks
associated with the sanctions regime]{.underline} (Deng 2022; Zhao
2023). Even if the geopolitical situation makes the prospects for Arctic
shipping uncertain, its attractiveness will continue to rise, given its
inherent advantages and the spectre of global warming (Liu and Han 2022;
Zhu 2022).

Previous literature has centred on discussions about Chinese strategic
intentions, suggesting that while China may 'publicly' engage in
cooperative rhetoric, there is also a parallel underlying agenda that
'treats the region as a site of geostrategic competition' (Pezard et al.
2022, 18). Instead, this section argued that neither cooperation nor
competition singularly defines China's understanding of international
relations. [[Dialectical thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} invites scholars
to look for sources of cooperation and competition and [[drives
Chinese]{.mark} academic [discourse about the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As academics adapt their
interpretations to new empirical realities, they constantly reconsider
their assessment of international relations in the Arctic, [looking for
ways in which China can]{.underline} effectively exercise its policy to
safeguard its interests and [cooperate with some nations while hedging
against potential conflicts with others. This [reflects]{.mark} the
official discourse's **[insistence on peace]{.mark}** and development
[as hallmarks of the current international system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Arctic---Russia/China

**China and Russia are revisionist aggressors in the Arctic---failure to
confront makes catastrophic war inevitable.**

The polar regions are changing, with projections of ice-free summers in
the Arctic and Antarctic by 2035 and 2060 respectively, meaning their
strategic value propositions are increasing.^2^ Neighboring [polar
powers are orienting their policies, postures, and military
capabilities]{.underline} toward each region because the current
international order looks increasingly orderless. [[**Absent military
confrontation**, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[will not
contain]{.mark}** the ambitions of [**China and Russia** in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} remote regions of the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Antarctica.
[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark} an adequate [[US
response]{.mark}]{.underline} (and coherent polar strategy), [**[China
and Russia will continue making gains]{.mark} in the polar
regions**,]{.underline} leading neighboring polar states to rebalance
their military postures and alliances to keep pace in the evolving polar
strategic competition.

As of 2021, the possibility of polar warfare with China and Russia
remains low. However, the problem of tomorrow should be the debate of
today, and [tomorrow's problem increasingly [looks like]{.mark}
competition and potential **[conflict]{.mark}** over the **polar
regions** rather than the false premise of preparing for a **traditional
war** in Eastern Europe or the South China Sea]{.underline}. Thus, there
needs to be an "American polar pivot" in policy and strategy (and
military capability) to counter and/or deter malign actions by China and
Russia in the Arctic and Antarctica.^3^

Compared with Russian Arctic military posture and Chinese Antarctic
orientation, America is militarily behind. With recent Russian military
and Chinese economic expansion, the Arctic is now en vogue for
international security scholars and practitioners.^4^ In 2019 President
Donald Trump, following in Harry Truman's footsteps, quipped of his
interest in purchasing Greenland. While the media mocked the president's
comments, they dismissed historic precedent and strategic implications:
Greenland has tremendous geopolitical and strategic value in shaping
future polar dynamics in the twenty-first century and beyond.^5^ The
Department of Defense claims the "immediate prospect of conflict in the
Arctic is low," but omits substantive discussion about Antarctica in its
defense and security posture. The Polar regions are among the least
understood strategic regions in the world, and the evidence supports
that assertion.

The US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) is the geographic combatant
command responsible for Antarctica. Despite this, its commander did not
mention Antarctica once in his 41-page March 2021 testimony to the House
Armed Services Committee.^6^ ADM Philip Davidson did, however, speak in
detail about Russian activity in the Arctic as among one of the
command's concerns, even though the USINDOPACOM area of responsibility
(AOR) does *not *extend into the Arctic Circle. The command's northern
boundary extends into the Bering Sea, thereby technically reaching the
Arctic Region according to the US legal definition of the Arctic but
hardly establishing itself as an Arctic-relevant command.^7^ The 11th
Air Force operates in the Arctic but does so under the operational
command of NORAD/NORTHCOM. The inconsistencies continue on the command's
website. As of this writing, the site's "About" section proclaims that
the USINDOPACOM AOR stretches "from Antarctica to the North
Pole."^8^ This is a patently false statement and is indicative of a
broader issue: the US defense establishment needs a geostrategic polar
education. The intrigue of polar conflict is generating discussion
marked by passionate arguments either sounding the alarm or quieting the
herd.^9^

This article contends that US policy makers should understand the
growing problem of suspicious Chinese and Russian actions in the polar
regions. The dangers of an uncontested China and Russia may lead to a
strategic imbalance in evolving regions of geostrategic and geopolitical
relevance. Thus, there should be focused policy solutions and military
capabilities dedicated toward ensuring that China and Russia do not
further challenge the status quo at the North Pole and South Pole.

The Polar Picture

Antarctica receives scant attention relative to the Arctic in
contemporary security affairs. The cold Arctic is a hot topic. Arguments
concerning potential Arctic conflict have adopted two competing
positions. The first group presents an *Arctic alarmist* narrative of
geopolitical and geostrategic interest warranting attention from the US
defense establishment to thwart the potential for Arctic
conflict.^10^ The second group presents an *Arctic apologist *narrative,
dismissing claims of strategic competition in the high north and
apologizing to the international community for the dangerous rhetoric.
Apologists promote Arctic apathy, believing that Arctic militarization
is sensationalist rhetoric absent any legitimate concern and that the
United States should abstain from engaging in Arctic militarization to
avoid conflict. Similar dynamics present when confronting the strategic
competition descending on Antarctica.

Given the divergence between the two intellectual camps and the
influence each has on future polar affairs, it is prudent to consider
their foundations and evolution. As we will see, each camp misses a
critical commonality in their predictive end states: Regardless of
whether the United States aggresses to or abstains from polar
militarization, competition is happening such that [**[confrontation is
inevitable]{.underline}**; [and **with** **confrontation** **comes**
**conflict**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A Thawing Polar Debate?

In terms of potential polar conflict stemming from strategic
competition, the Arctic takes center stage in academic and policy
debates. The arc of Arctic security literature swings from the bellicose
Arctic alarmist viewpoint to the nonbelligerent Arctic
apologist* *perspective, with the latter viewed as the dominant (and
preferred) position. Arctic apologists suggest that the United States
should not increase Arctic militarization and that any advocacy
otherwise is fearmongering and provocation or "poking the Russian
bear."^11^

*Arctic Apologists: Avoiding Confrontation*

The Arctic apologist camp points to various reasons why the United
States should refrain from power projection in the Arctic---such as
limited American icebreaker capabilities relative to China and Russia,
overstated geopolitical significance of the Arctic, and unneeded Arctic
economic resources---that all collectively amount to nonintervention.
Arctic apologists claim Arctic defense and security concerns unfounded
melodrama and further accuse Arctic alarmists' claims for Arctic
militarization as creating the caricature of a truly cold war with China
and Russia over polar bears and seals.

As US defense officials are gradually raising the Arctic profile, there
is a disquieting narrative to US Arctic policy promoting a restrained
approach. This camp contends that "there is no scramble for the Arctic"
and that the United States must resist temptation to expand its Arctic
military footprint---because doing so will give Russia an excuse to
escalate militarily.^12^ This narrative paints the Arctic as a
traditional "zone of peace," such that anything challenging that notion
injects irrational fear.^13^ This narrative holds that Russian Arctic
military expansion is innocuous and defensive, unworthy of international
attention, and hardly enough to compel US military posturing in
response. It views Russian Arctic militarization as a means for
protection and economic survival in the face of perceived rival
great-power expansionism in their own backyard. However, apologists
ignore the growing Russian military activity in the Arctic, resting
their assumptions on the supposedly normative notion of exceptional
peace inherent in the polar region, assuming it too taboo for conflict.
Ironically, these apologists anchor their position of a peaceful Arctic
to the debunked notion of Arctic exceptionalism.

In 2015, researchers at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs
examined the notion of Arctic exceptionalism: a "political vision . . .
\[with the Arctic\] as a 'zone of peace' and a 'territory of dialogue'
unlike any other region."^14^ Though the Finnish scholars concluded
Arctic exceptionalism as misguided, the idea of the Arctic as a remote
and peaceful domain devoid of conflict has become a dominating
narrative---in part because it is true. Whereas some scholarly articles
advanced this peaceful position in recent years, the Arctic apologist
normative narrative has gained the most popularity in the twenty-first
century.^15^

Arctic apologists have taken their positions and filled the pages of
online commentary, scholarly discourse, and even Twitter feeds with
them. Public platforms are ripe with articles warning against the perils
of Arctic militarization. Since 2015 alone, there are dozens of pieces
advancing this position. For instance, Pincus and Berbrick contend the
Arctic is not a top US geopolitical priority, encouraging nonmilitarized
strategic engagement.^16^ Similarly, Robert Murray claimed there was
"little to gain" for Russia if it were to engage in military conflict
with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in the Arctic.^17^ He
argues that Russian activities are a defensive effort to secure vital
Arctic economic interests and that ideas of confronting Russia only
provoke tension. Stephanie Pezard echoes similar sentiments about the
United States treading lightly in the Arctic to avoid unnecessary
militarization and competition.^18^ Pezard presents an apologist
framework for avoiding Arctic competition and conflict, with a warning
that "tit-for-tat dynamics \[in the Arctic between the United States and
Russia\] could lead to escalation."^19^

More recently, Rachael Gosnell contends that the Arctic Council has
sufficiently neutralized Arctic tensions for years as a stabilizing
institutional body, although Russia's 2018 exclusion from the Arctic
Security Forces Roundtable has raised the specter of hostility.^20^ Dave
Auerswald suggests the United States should "play the long game,"
contending that freedom of navigation operations in the Arctic with
insufficient capabilities are a waste of time.^21^ He contends that
there would be a bigger payoff to creating a global public narrative
that condemns Russia's Arctic actions rather than confronting the
Russian threat militarily. To this end, others such as Robert English
warn of the costs of getting involved in an "Arctic arms race," arguing
that doing so would be motivated by "threat inflation" and would likely
end similarly to one of America's past "foreign policy
blunders."^22^ This is not a comprehensive illustration of the
commentary denouncing Arctic militarization; rather, it is a mere
sampling of the evolving position arguing for a passive approach to
Arctic security that is---ironically---almost entirely reliant on
increasingly fragile international institutions, norms, and traditions
to maintain Arctic stability. There is even an evolving phenomenon in
which Arctic apologists mock Arctic alarmists through dismissive and
satirical writing, a scholarly positional harrying that seeks to
discredit references to the Arctic as a potential geostrategic zone of
competition and conflict.^23^

Dozens of articles circulate with similar apologist positions advancing
Arctic pacifism. Despite the Department of Defense's 2019 *Arctic
Strategy* (as well as the Air Force, Army, and Navy strategies of the
same tone) calling for increased Arctic awareness, enhanced Arctic
operations, and rules-based order in the Arctic, the apologist narrative
has been mainstreamed as a default US Arctic policy
position.^24^ Whereas online commentary is littered with utopian
arguments assuming geopolitical centrism and calling for a restrained
approach to Arctic security reliant on institutional liberalism and
diplomacy, there is comparably little peer-reviewed academic scholarship
that does the same. The dominant position in online commentary views the
Arctic as an insignificant, unwinnable, and low-threat region, but
others in both online and scholarly mediums argue the opposite and
expect the Arctic---and its polar counterpart Antarctica---to be among
the most important geopolitical and geostrategic hot spots that shape
competition among the great powers in the twenty-first century and
beyond.

*Arctic Alarmists: Leverage Through Strength*

Those arguing for greater American involvement in the Arctic note
expanding Russian military infrastructure and Chinese economic interests
for trade routes as ways the power balance can shift out of US favor
absent corresponding orientation and posturing. According to this camp,
Moscow's and Beijing's efforts indicate deliberate attempts to
outmaneuver the United States in the Arctic. Russia, under Vladimir
Putin, counters America by engaging in political information warfare
against the West. Moreover, US officials believe Russia is violating
international treaties by virtue of testing low-yield nuclear weapons at
an Arctic site in the Novaya Zemlya Islands.^25^ China, under Xi
Jinping, is also undermining America and the West. Chinese nuclear
icebreakers will likely support the clearing of maritime channels for an
evolving Chinese commercial industry and trade routes. However, since
the economy is under the Chinese Communist Party, China will likely use
its icebreakers in support of shrouded military objectives. Thus, future
Chinese icebreaking and so-called commercial traffic might be a guise
for positioning military assets in the Arctic, similar to the Chinese
use of commercial fishing vessels in the South China Sea to veil
military activity. With these and other activities in mind, Arctic
alarmists point to many significant geopolitical and geostrategic
indicators in their lobbying for Arctic importance.

Arctic security discourse tends toward climate discussions---identifying
the Arctic as the pinnacle domain effected by anthropogenic changes to
the earth's atmosphere. Since 2011, there have been four Arctic-focused
edited volumes examining northern geopolitics, security, and climate
change.^26^ Though each book rebukes notions of Arctic tensions, the
prevailing position contends that the Arctic is a complex domain of
great-power rivalry and competition spurred by environmental changes and
increased access. Each text is layered with content discussing the
precarious position of international laws, institutions, and norms as
they seek to collectively bind Arctic actors to a codified list of
acceptable activities within a unique global commons returning to
relevancy thanks to the twenty-first century surge for resources.
Whereas some observers outline the evolving nature of Arctic
militarization as reality---despite the Arctic's long-enjoyed
designation as an international zone of peace---they acknowledge
Russia's and China's advances but stop short of advocating similar
advances for the United States.^27^ While many scholars acknowledge the
realities of renewed Arctic tensions, few extend their arguments to
suggest deliberate Artic militarization.

Despite this prevailing hesitancy, scholars grapple with observable
realities leading to the conclusion that the Arctic is no longer
exceptional or a zone of peace. But just as they contend with Arctic
security issues in myriad ways, they also---with some exceptions---hold
a predominantly optimistic outlook and advocate change and improvement
to stave off future Arctic tensions and resulting conflict. Owing to
their optimism, these scholars are better labeled Arctic "advocates"
than they are "alarmists," as they seek improvement by advancing the
dialogue in constructive ways without blindly clinging to dated notions
of Arctic stability.

Those who contribute to the discourse still see great-power economic
interests and initiatives as conflict avoidance mechanisms but
acknowledge that these interests can just as easily become points of
future contention if mismanaged.^28^ They acknowledge the trillions of
dollars of untapped natural resources---ripe for exploitation by capable
actors---as a major motivator for further Arctic undertakings.^29^ But
where the Arctic advocates stop and separate from Arctic alarmists is in
their understanding of great-power activities and the underlying intent
driving them.

The Arctic alarmists perceive Russian Arctic expansionist indicators as
displaying similar intent to the 2014 annexation of Crimea while
likewise extending China's actions in the South China Sea as a
predictive analog for *their* Arctic intent. Some scholars dispute the
"South China Sea as a precursor to the Arctic" argument and further
question the existence of a Russo-Sino alliance.^30^ Noting
Russia--China tensions, Arctic alarmists insist that Russia and China
exhibit *bandwagoning* behaviors and seek to supplant the United States
as the global hegemon, perceiving the Arctic as an opportunistic avenue
to do so. For Arctic alarmists, establishing a military foothold now,
consistent with the US Air Force's 2020 *Arctic Strategy*, calls for an
expanded infrastructure base in addition to power projection, vigilance,
deterrence through cooperation, and cold-weather preparation.^31^ Arctic
alarmists remind us that Russia operates nuclear-powered submarines in
the Arctic, has dozens of military facilities in its Arctic territory,
maintains a dedicated Arctic military command, and flies bomber sorties
throughout the Arctic regularly. Russia is already years ahead of the
United States in the Arctic.

To alarmists, Russian military efforts are a precursor to controlling
the high north, challenging American command of the commons, asserting
influence, and even holding the US homeland at risk. Already, Russian
military capabilities threaten the American homeland due to their
unstoppable hypersonic ballistic missiles based in the Arctic.^32^ In
the words of former US Northern Command Commander General Terrance
O'Shaughnessy: "The Homeland is not a sanctuary" the way it once
was.^33^

Scholars will continue to debate whether the Arctic matters for the
United States such that it should compel military involvement. There
will continue to be disputes over Chinese and Russian Arctic ambition
relative to American interests. These discussions will grapple with
whether Russia aggressively seeks offensive expansion or merely
defensive security for its northern territories. Others will contend
with whether China---as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---actually
desires Arctic influence via its Polar Silk Road (part of China's major
economic Belt and Road \[BRI\] initiative) or merely seeks to advance
its own economic position via access to Arctic resources and alternative
shipping lanes connecting Asia and Europe.^34^ We will continue reading
about Russian icebreakers outnumbering American icebreaker capabilities
20-to-1, or even 40-to-1---the so-called icebreaker gap---and what the
United States should (or should not) do about such a capability
imbalance.^35^ Moreover, Arctic alarmists will point to the continued
Russian military buildup of Arctic infrastructure, the questionably
legal control Russia claims over the Northern Sea Route, and the 2014
establishment of the Northern Fleet and its Arctic focus---coupled with
Moscow's planning and execution of thousands of Arctic exercises and
infrastructure modernization efforts---as points of attention for the
evolving Arctic significance.^ 36^

For this side, Moscow's economic and military commitment to the Arctic
indicates significant interest and intent such that the United States
must not dismiss it as irrelevant to future international security,
especially considering the United States is an Arctic state with a
national coastline on Arctic shores. We must reject the false notion of
Arctic exceptionalism regarding the great-power competition of the
twenty-first century. Instead, we need to adopt the notion of *Arctic
essentialism* that sees the Arctic for its value in the international
security chess game, not for the utopic zone of peace we hope it will
be.

*Focusing the Arctic Debate on Harsh Realities of Military Power*

The Arctic is the only coastal region of the United States with an
active strategic competitor conducting regular military activity off the
coast, and yet northern air defenses are obsolete. The North Warning
System (NWS) is an aging northern-tier radar array spread across Alaska
and Canada meant to identify incoming missile threats. The NWS relies on
1980s technology and needs to be replaced.^37^ This twentieth-century
system is incapable of providing sufficient warning to defend against
modern Russian air- and sea-launched cruise missiles able to strike
North American targets from beyond existing radar coverage. The Russian
hypersonic missile threat presents an objective capability that the
United States cannot overcome.

Hypersonic missiles keep US planners up at night. These are dual-threat
weapons combining the flight-path maneuverability of guided cruise
missiles with the speed of ballistic missiles. They can be used in two
ways: as a hypersonic cruise missile propelled by a hydrogen propulsion
air-breathing engine, or as a hypersonic glide vehicle launched via a
rocket before detaching to glide to its target. Irrespective of delivery
method, hypersonic projectiles can accelerate several times faster than
the speed of sound and are able to maneuver across thousands of miles in
minutes, enabling them to negate modern missile defense systems. Further
compounding the threat, hypersonic missiles can be launched from
land-based mobile rocket launchers or fighter aircraft, can carry
conventional or nuclear warheads, and maintain precision strike accuracy
to within 10--20 meters of its target (though Russia claims within a
meter).^38^ The United States has no publicly revealed capability to
reliably defend against hypersonic missiles. While some warn against
buying into the hypersonic hype and contend the threat is embellished,
the United States cannot take that risk. As such, Russia's deployments
of hypersonic weapon systems to the Arctic should give US officials
reason for concern.

In December 2019, Russia confirmed the deployment of the hypersonic
Kinzhal (Russian for "dagger") air-launched ballistic missile to the
Arctic.^39^ The aptly named Kinzhal can be launched from Russian fighter
aircraft with a conventional or nuclear warhead traveling more than
7,600 miles per hour and strike targets 1,200 miles away with precision
accuracy. Another recently deployed Russian hypersonic weapon, the
Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, reportedly travels 20--27 times the
speed of sound (15,000--20,000 mph) and can strike targets up to 3,700
miles away.^40^ But Russia hardly needs this range to reach the United
States

Russia has an air and naval base on Wrangel Island, about 300 miles from
the Alaskan coastline on the western edge of the Chukchi
Sea.^41^ However, such close proximity is almost irrelevant with
maneuverable land- or air-launched hypersonic missiles capable of
traversing the Arctic Ocean to strike a target with nuclear warheads
from more than 3,000 miles away in less than 10 minutes. At these
standoff ranges, much of Alaska is within range of Russian Avangards if
they were launched from any of the dozens of Russian military bases
north of the Arctic Circle. These are---as Russia
claims---unstoppable missiles that both Russia and China possess; the
United States has neither a close analog nor the technology to
sufficiently defend against them.

According to General O'Shaughnessy, Russian hypersonic missiles can
"strike Alaska with little indication or warning."^42^ The NWS is more
than 30 years old and incapable of effectively tracking and warning
against modern hypersonic missiles. To establish a good defense, the
United States is pursuing answers to this tangible threat in the Arctic
via its efforts to develop the Strategic Homeland Integrated Ecosystem
Layered Defense (SHIELD), a system designed to detect and defeat
threats to the United States. The problem is that SHIELD, while a
fancifully named defense, is a long way from operational reality.^43^ In
the absence of a good defense against advancing adversaries in the
Arctic, the United States needs a good offense in the surface domain to
forestall these formidable systems. This security problem is only
compounded by the fact that the situation is no better in the maritime
domain.

Beyond the inadequacy of the NWS relative to modern Russian surface
strike capabilities, Russia's new submarines are quieter and more
difficult for US undersea surveillance capabilities to reliably track
and predict. Russian submarines can effectively maneuver undetected
throughout the Arctic Ocean.^44^ US naval presence in the Arctic
provides a "fundamental security confidence" for US power projection,
but US naval capabilities are equally inadequate when it comes to polar
operations relative to Russia and China.^45^

As Russian capabilities advance both in speed and distance, the vast
Arctic---as a new "battlespace"---begins to compress.^46^ Battlespace
compression leads to reduced reactions times and---given US reliance on
twentieth-century technology---an inability to defend the US homeland
against a modernized Russian Arctic force capable of exploiting US
complacency in future strategic competition. The Pentagon insists that
the 2019 *Arctic Strategy* is rooted in and informed by the
2017 *National Security Strategy* (*NSS*) and 2018 *National Defense
Strategy*. The first pillar of the 2017 *NSS* is to "protect the
American people, the homeland, and the American way of life," and the
first secondary pillar of this priority focus is to secure US borders
and territory. Despite this charge, the United States cannot meet this
intent on its northern Arctic border operating under the current
technological disparity. This is a critical vulnerability, and the most
recent 2021 *Interim National Security Strategic Guidance*, issued by
the Joseph Biden administration, omits any reference to the Arctic and
Antarctica.

Russian capabilities coupled with Chinese nuclear icebreakers and polar
flying squadrons have collectively established a polar offset with
greater polar military capabilities compared with those of America.
Measuring and understanding intent is difficult to quantify and
interpret, so predicting future conflict is equally challenging.
However, the Artic alarmist argument looks at objective indicators of
the polar power policies and activities in the poles coupled with the
changing geography and corresponding geopolitical environment to inform
its collective position that the Arctic is now---or soon will be---an
arena for great-power conflict. To this end, interpreting Arctic actions
by strategic competitors is just as important as understanding their
similar behavior patterns in Antarctica.^47^

The South Pole Blind Spot

Polar geopolitics with an eye toward defense and security
affairs---inclusive of both the Arctic and Antarctica---is not a topic
of regular debate among academics and practitioners. Few have questioned
how the polar regions collectively will evolve as geopolitical and
geostrategic inflection points of competition. What are the strategic
implications for Arctic competition relative to Antarctica?

Whereas Arctic security is now a regular discussion point, Antarctic
dialogue generally assumes that the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) will
assure indefinite peace.^48^ The Antarctic Treaty of 1959---and its
complementary agreements forming the ATS---is the primary regulatory
framework for Antarctic activity. The Antarctic Treaty prohibits
military maneuvers and specifies that military assets can be used only
for assisting scientific research, logistics, and search-and-rescue
missions. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty (the Madrid Protocol), signed in 1998, designates Antarctica as a
"natural reserve devoted to peace and science."^49^ Thus, Antarctica has
been---save for a handful of singular incidents mentioned
above---entirely demilitarized since the treaty entered into force in
1961.^50^

Despite the Antarctic Treaty's restrictions on militarization, Chinese
and Russian actions elsewhere indicate their willingness to deviate from
international laws, rules, and norms. Some scholars and policy makers
remain committed to the assumption that China and Russia will respect
international institutions, despite numerous contradictory
examples.^51^ Currently, Chinese actions in Antarctica blur the lines
between military operations and research. Just as the Chinese expand
their "civilian research presence"^ ^in the Arctic as an apparent veil
for enabling a future military presence tied to economic interests, they
likewise appear to be pursuing a similar approach in Antarctica through
expanding capabilities and infrastructure projects including research
stations, airstrip construction, and the creation of a dedicated
Antarctic air squadron in 2016.^52^

According to Anne-Marie Brady, China is "keeping other states guessing
about its true intentions and interests" in Antarctica.^53^ Brady and
others perceive China's increased Antarctic activity---now totaling 36
Antarctic expeditions and counting---as posturing for exploitation after
the Madrid Protocol enters a period for renegotiation in 2048, or
perhaps earlier if the Antarctic Treaty is abandoned.^54^ To this point,
speaking at the Mitchell Institute in 2019, US Air Force general Charles
Brown recounted an incident in which a Chinese icebreaker experienced
mechanical issues in the Antarctic region and, instead of traveling to
New Zealand (the closest port of repair), suspiciously traveled direct
to China. "Coincidence? Makes me a little suspect," General Brown
stated.^55^ In the context of strategic competition and the potential
for future conflict, Chinese and Russian motives must be reexamined.

Chinese military ambition is global in nature and underpinned by China's
BRI efforts. Beijing has invested (or attempted investments) in
Greenland, Iceland, Canada, Nicaragua, sub-Saharan Africa, the South and
East China Seas, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and other
areas to form the linked network for the BRI as the primary vehicle for
advancing its global hegemonic ambitions.^56^ Antarctica is no
exception. Considering these and other Chinese actions, we should not be
surprised that General Brown publicly states the Antarctic is "just a
number of years away" from a great-power competition similar to the
Arctic.^57^

Though Antarctica does not rival the Arctic in geographic relevance or
economic importance to the United States, continued omission of
Antarctica from the strategic competition narrative further enables
Chinese exploitation of the ambiguities present in international
agreements. As an example, the US State Department's 2019 *Indo-Pacific
Vision* cover page has a map of the region, which excludes Antarctica,
and rest of the document's 32 pages have no mention of the continent in
any context.^58^ These are subtly significant indicators of US Antarctic
indifference, providing exploitative motivations for strategic
competitors like Russia and China. Moreover, China increasingly views
itself as a polar power.^59^ The United States is not a near-Antarctic
power by geographical standards, but by virtue of being a hegemon and
defender of the commons it is a de facto near-Antarctic power.^60^

There is too much at stake in the era of renewed strategic competition
and the evolution of space as a future conflict domain for Antarctica to
remain Washington's strategic blind spot. The United States must
strengthen its partnerships with New Zealand and Australia (and other
near-Antarctic partners) as gateway countries for Antarctic access. The
continued use of Christchurch International Airport to fly annual
Operation Deep Freeze missions in support of the US Antarctic Program
warrants bolstered support.^61^ Scholars and policy makers must address
Antarctica in future debates and include it in strategic discussions on
polar defense and security, precisely because the future of American
space power and operations is dependent on communication infrastructure
in the polar regions.

Besides excluding Antarctica from the polar picture, the debate is
superficial and devoid of historical context and theoretical
considerations as predictors of future action. The discussion over true
Russian and Chinese intent in the polar regions is ambiguous, and
ambiguity begets speculation. With speculation saturating public
commentary, the discourse continues to overlook the lessons of history.
What about the evolving polar-region dynamic parallels history? And what
can we learn to offer a glimpse into the future of potential polar
conflict? In terms of strategic competition and conflict, history must
be included to form a comprehensive predictive narrative influencing
future policy and strategy. Policy that informs strategy toward
particular ends is best informed by an understanding of the relevant
history shaping the current environment. For the polar regions, history
runs deep.

History and Context

Since the early twentieth century, the United States and many other
nations have conducted polar military operations and military-supported
scientific expeditions. As more countries arrived in the polar regions,
the need for international cooperation mechanisms grew. Both the
Antarctic Treaty and the Arctic Council were designed as solutions to
resolve polar tensions, with many holding these cooperative institutions
in high regard. Yet, these supposedly effective institutions are seldom
discussed in contemporary policy circles, as they both lack effective
enforcement mechanisms. Historical antecedents are often useful points
of departure such that we cannot afford to continue overlooking relevant
history and theory in debates about future strategic competition in the
Arctic and Antarctica. History provides insights on how command of the
commons is at stake in the polar regions and how disagreement over who
commands the commons is a reliable predictor of confrontation and
eventual conflict.

From the seventeenth century to the early twentieth, the British
controlled the maritime commons. Because they controlled the commons,
they controlled the seas. Those who most control and influence a domain
make the rules. China and Russia are attempting to establish polar
dominance via their respective polar pivots. Polar presence will promote
influence, which will lead to economic gain and increased global power
sufficient to destabilize, potentially, the international system to the
detriment of the West. Hegemonic stability theory holds that the world
order is most stable under unipolarity with a single global hegemon. So,
a Chinese or Russian challenge to American command of the commons---via
related challenges to or departures from the existing polar claims and
international covenants---will have certain destabilizing
effects.^62^ Consider the tenets of the so-called long cycle theory:
since the fifteenth century, hegemonic power transitions tend to occur,
on average, every 75 years. It has been more than 75 years since the
United States first assumed its status as the world leader. If history
is any indicator, the United States is primed for challenge to its
hegemony.^63^

[There are]{.underline} numerous [[warning signs of]{.mark} rising
powers asserting regional hegemonic [ambition in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Antarctica. The budding Chinese and
Russian "strategic partnership,"^64^ [[a **revisionist Russia**]{.mark}
relapsing to Cold War--era aggression]{.underline} and rhetoric, and
China's antagonistic global expansionism combined with known and
demonstrated Polar interests, activities, and investments demonstrate
commitment to change. Revisionist states have explicitly undermined US
interests since at least 2010 such that [their ambitions cannot be
dismissed as innocuous or inconsequential]{.underline}. The polar
regions are opportunistic targets of low-risk, high-payoff expansion for
China and Russia given the relative lack of American polar presence and
policy commitment.

Strategic competition is on the rise, and [the [**ingredients**
**for**]{.mark} international **confrontation** and eventual
[**conflict** are **brewing**.]{.mark} The **polar regions**, more than
any other, pose the greatest threat to current American
hegemony]{.underline}. [Two rising powers are challenging the current

Graham Allison's descriptive problem of the **Thucydides Trap**, that
when these conditions are present, the]{.underline} [**potential for
conflict increases**.]{.underline} In this way, there are indications
abound suggesting that [we are progressing toward]{.underline} the
realization of [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar **[[Polar
Trap.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

*The Polar Trap*

Considering Chinese and Russian policies and actions, the polar regions
are becoming easy power grabs. Whereas the United States stands as the
current global hegemon, or the ruling power in historical narrative,
[increased activities by **China and Russia** in the polar
regions]{.underline}---coupled with American strategic dithering
elsewhere in the world---[contribute to the necessary preconditions for
realization of the Thucydides Trap.]{.underline} Coined by Graham
Allison in 2015, [the concept suggests that **[when]{.mark}**ever the
rise of [an]{.mark} **[ambitious power]{.mark}** [threatens to dethrone
the]{.mark} existence of a [current hegemon, the]{.mark} likely
**[result is war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}^65^

According to Allison, 12 of the 16 recorded cases of a rising power
threatening a ruling one in the past 500 years resulted in
war.^66^ Some, such as Jonathan Kirshner openly, question Allison's
assumptions and arguments, chiefly that his case-selection bias supports
his theory *and* that the four cases where war did not
result *all* occurred after 1945 where nuclear weapons changed the
calculus behind great-power wars.^67^ Still, there is empirical validity
to the concept that provides utility in applying it to a lesser-known
region. In this way, we generate a template for understanding future
polar power competition and predicting a potential Polar Trap under
similar circumstances.^68^

The Thucydides Trap is illustrative of a security dilemma when a ruling
power proactively confronts a rising power militarily over a contested
domain, thereby leading to greater militarization and raising the
potential for conflict. In each of Allison's cases, he identifies the
period in which the conflict occurs, a ruling power, a rising power, a
contested domain, and a binary outcome of war or no war. Using this
framework, there are similarities to the evolving situation in the polar
regions. Whereas the rise of Athens supposedly threatened Sparta and
catalyzed war, continued tensions stemming from Russian and Chinese
presence in the polar regions will likewise undermine American hegemony.
Increased military activities by rival competitors will continue
producing the conditions for confrontation.

*Conditions for the Polar Trap*

Allison's theory stems from his interpretation of Thucydides's writings
in the *History of the Peloponnesian War.*^69^* *According to Allison,
Thucydides focused on the shift in the balance of power between Athens
and Sparta as the basis for their eventual conflict. Allison contends
Thucydides specified two primary drivers of the dynamic leading to the
trap: (1) the burgeoning *entitlement*, sense of *importance*, and
demand for *influence *by the rising power, coupled directly with (2)
the rising power's *fear *and *insecurity*.^70^ When a rising power
demonstrated each of these attributes, Allison and his research team
found that they challenged---in some way---the ruling power of the time.
Though Allison's team limited its study to 16 cases, 75 percent of the
historical cases meeting these criteria resulted in war.^71^ The team
further identified two cases in which the United States was the ruling
power and simultaneously threatened by at least one rising power: World
War II and the Cold War.

In general, the international order maintains stability when states are
satisfied with the order and thus adopt an orientation to preserve the
status quo. Threats to the international order tend to come from
dissatisfied states seeking to gain more territory, better status, or
different rules. Dissatisfied states, then, adopt revisionist agendas
and increasingly "mount challenges against the hegemon and its order"
whenever the hegemon fails to accommodate their interests or actively
seeks to restrict them.^72^ In this way, the circumstances of World War
II are notably similar to twenty-first century great-power competition.

In World War II, the United States faced the Axis Powers: the German,
Italian, and Japanese alliance intent on upending Western democratic
norms. In today's competitive environment, Russia and China demonstrate
similar motivations. Is Russia or China baiting the United States toward
conflict with one so that the other can rise to power? The nuclear
tensions and military posturing of the Cold War are similar to today's
contemporary security environment in that the presence of nuclear
weapons alone seems to prevent large-scale military conflict for fear of
irrecoverable escalation into nuclear warfare.

Whereas the existence of nuclear weapons continues to serve as a mutual
deterrent, great-power conflict is not a figment of twenty-first century
imagination. Rather, an emerging body of scholarship suggests that
great-power conflict can "unravel without anyone ever firing a
shot."^73^ History tells us that during periods of hegemonic transition,
the hegemon faces increasing difficulties in maintaining its preferred
international order; its relative decline encourages other states
unhappy with that order to seek to renegotiate terms, build alternative
arrangements of one kind or another, probe for weaknesses, and even
directly challenge the dominant power or its allies. [[In the
worst-case]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}, peaceful adjustment to the
changing distribution of military and economic capabilities proves
impossible; as it did in World War I and World War II, the system
collapses into a devastating **[[great-power
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.^74^

After 75 years of hegemony, the United States today is dealing with a
revisionist Russia and rising China. History is not on Washington's side
at the moment. Moscow and Beijing are working to build alternative
global structures that alter the American-led status quo. Each continues
prodding for US vulnerabilities, carried out via sharp power campaigns
meant to undermine US domestic and US-led international institutions.
China and Russia are actively pursuing military and economic influence
efforts in the polar regions, as a perceived weakness to US primacy.
With weakening status, Cooley and Nexon argue American hegemony can fall
via three main mechanisms, or "pathways of change": *great-power
challenges*, *changing small and weak state behaviors*,
and *transnational contention*. There is evidence of each occurring in
the contemporary international security environment.

*Polar Pathways of Change*

In terms of *great-power challenges*, (i.e., direct contestation from
competing peer or near-peer states), the United States faces increasing
challenges from both Russia and China spanning economic, diplomatic, and
informational strategies. Military challenges remain distanced and
indirect, but confrontations between US forces versus Russian and
Chinese forces are becoming more frequent in the Arctic and the South
China Sea, respectively. China's ascent to international influence has
also led to notable *changes in small and weak state behaviors*. As an
example, 18 of the 30 NATO member states currently have a signed
memorandum of understanding to economically partner with China's
BRI.^75^ NATO states with ties to the BRI are predominantly among those
considered weakest within the NATO alliance, furthering Cooley and
Nexon's notion of changing small and weak state behaviors as a precursor
to US hegemonic unraveling. What does China's BRI and its connection to
the weak states within the NATO alliance say about NATO's future
stability?

According to Cooley and Nexon, *transnationalism* entails the
destabilization of previously held norms and foreign policy frameworks.
They further contend that rising powers wishing to contest the ruling
power and the established order adopt "wedge" strategies to dissolve the
fabric of the order and its structure.^76^ Hegemons such as the United
States provide a collective security proposition to weaker states,
incentivizing allegiance absent a better alternative. This proposition
provides a security blanket (i.e., subsidy) to small states lacking
strong economies to build and maintain organically powerful militaries
sufficient for their own security.

When economic powers such as China enter the fray and offer financial
incentives to small states, it can be a compelling and competing value
proposition that strains existing alliances. In a form of realpolitik,
if a powerful state can offer sufficient incentive for a weaker state to
question the value of its existing security blanket and ideologies, this
threatens to unravel the threads of ideologically sewn alliances. With
most NATO states economically partnered with China---a country the
United States now labels as its "greatest potential adversary"---a
question is raised about NATO's legitimacy as an alliance durable enough
to withstand Beijing's economic wedge-driving.^77^

Consider as well that many of the current international institutions
serving as the "connective tissue" of the contemporary international
order were established during the US unipolar movement.^78^ These
longstanding US-led institutions are at risk of dissolving at worst or
repurposing and reorganizing at best. From 2017--2020, the Trump
administration governed on an "America First" platform that openly
denounced the value of and need for multilateralism, international
organizations, alliances, and liberal values in general, viewing such
arrangements as a "threat to American power."^79^ As the United States
backed further away from international institutions under the Trump
administration, questioned alliances and partnerships, and generally
condemned the international community for collectively freeriding on the
back of the US economy, Washington gave away its formal and informal
position as hegemon---giving China an opening to make numerous
peripheral gains at the expense of the West.

*Chinese Conditions*

In developing his theory, Allison focused on China as a rising power
intent on challenging the United States as the current ruling power. To
this end, Allison notes that Lee Kuan Yew---who Allison calls the
"world's premier China watcher"---predicted that [[**China's ambition**
is]{.mark} unquestionably **[global
hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^80^ Adding to this, Chinese president
[**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping [has **stated**]{.mark} on numerous occasions
his **unambiguous i[ntent to change the world order]{.mark}** by putting
China on the path to "global eminence.]{.underline}"^81^ [China's
growing sense of self-importance and global ambition are
robust.]{.underline} [**[Few doubt Chinese intentions of unseating the
U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates as the dominant global
superpower]{.underline}. Worse, [[**China has developed** a
"**grievance-fueled sense of entitlement**]{.mark}," [**demonstrated**
in]{.mark} the ongoing [**territorial disputes** in the **South** and
**East China Seas**]{.mark}.^82^]{.underline}

We should consider Beijing's behavior here and in other areas as
indicators of broadening---and largely unchecked---ambition. The United
States is the only nation capable of counterbalancing Beijing's
ambition. However, China is leapfrogging US containment efforts and is
on track to challenge American hegemony by trying to secure its own
ports and airfields across the South Pacific.^83^ Whereas the United
States maintains more than 800 bases or installations worldwide, its
polar-region presence is comparably nonexistent.^84^ Beijing knows
this---and it is exploiting this American strategic oversight.

Absent military presence and strategic orientation to the north and
south, the United States is unable to influence these areas the way it
can elsewhere. Without a power to balance against at the ends of the
earth, Beijing began its own polar pivot in 2017. [China's
self-proclaimed status as a "near-Arctic state" illustrates
entitlement]{.underline} despite the fact that no such recognition
exists.^85^ A "near-Antarctic state" view of China is also fostered
domestically in China by sending the second-most number of tourists to
Antarctica of any country, thereby familiarizing its citizens with the
continent and [creating a narrative of China's destiny to manage the
future of Antarctic control]{.underline}.^86^

In further attempts to advance its polar influence, [**[China's Polar
Silk Road]{.mark}** policy [broadens its ambition to assert
power]{.mark} and influence over the polar regions]{.underline}. China's
Yellow River Research Station in Svalbard is among its most prized polar
achievements. To the south, its newly developed Antarctic air squadron
serves a research mission similar to that of the US Air Force logistics
support of the National Science Foundation, yet questions remain about
the nature of such activities due to ongoing Chinese efforts to conceal
Chinese Antarctic operations.^87^

Since Australia and New Zealand are members of the American-led "Five
Eyes Alliance," Beijing knows that, in a crisis, neither country would
support Chinese operations in Antarctica. Thus, China appears to be
laying the groundwork for supporting Antarctic operations via
infrastructure projects in the South Pacific near New Zealand and Papua
New Guinea. Beijing is building a port facility
and---presumably---military infrastructure at Luganville Wharf in
Vanuatu, a small, underdeveloped island nation only 1,000 miles north of
New Zealand, to the concern of Australian leaders.^88^ Similarly, China
inked a deal with Papua New Guinea to build a "comprehensive
multifunctional fishery industrial park" on Daru, a small island
community just off the country's southern coast and about 125 miles
north of Australia.^89^ This deal gives Beijing proximal access to
northern Australia and Port Darwin, where Beijing has a long-term port
lease that has deterred the US Navy and Marine Corps from establishing
its own infrastructure.^90^ The implications extend beyond Beijing's
apparent attempts at driving a wedge between Australia and the US
military's attempts at securing regional presence.

Daru Island sits approximately 4,100 miles south of China's Port of
Shanghai---the world's largest container port---via maritime route.
Hardly a coincidence, Daru Island is about 4,000 miles north via
maritime route of China's newest Antarctic research station on
Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea---China's closest
station to the US McMurdo Station on Ross Island.^91^ On Daru Island,
China gains dual-use (commercial and military) infrastructure at an
equidistant location between its largest mainland port and its newest
Antarctic research station while also securing a location that puts it
in close proximity to its Darwin port and the geographic focal point of
the US Navy and Marine Corps in the region. For context, we must couple
these geostrategic moves with American military commanders' concerns
with China's unwillingness to allow unfettered Consultative Party
inspections of their five Antarctic research stations, per Article VII
of the ATS.^92^ [Continued **[Chinese secrecy in
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Antarctic activities [[lends]{.mark}
further [weight to the argument that **Beijing's polar ambition is
malign**]{.mark}---and that institutions meant to keep both regions
peaceful are failing to enforce basic rules.]{.underline}

Those who continue to dismiss the rise of China as a threat to the
United States and international norms are not paying attention. The
Chinese economy is expanding to outcompete the United States in numerous
indices (depending on one's measure of economic strength).^ 93^ In terms
of gross domestic product, China's meteoric ascent since the 1980s shows
no signs of leveling off. Yes, using GDP as the basis of assessing
China's economic strength is unidimensional in that it measures only
production and ignores costs or consumption rates, but it is nonetheless
a global indicator of a state's economic productivity. Some will argue
that China---due to its enormous population and consumption needs---is
an inefficient economy in terms of its net indicators (or, more
generally, its productivity minus its costs).^94^ Whereas China's GDP
makes it the second-most powerful country in the world by that sole
indicator, if we consider its net indicators inclusive of its
productivity minus costs, Beijing's strength is far less impressive.

To this end, others contend that China is not a threat because of its
fragile economy, that the significance of its global influence is
overstated based on flawed logic, ignorant to the realities of
unquenchable resource consumption needs. [However, this position
unwittingly advances the argument establishing China's insecurity and
increasing ambition. **[Despite]{.mark}** growing **[economic
power]{.mark}** by way of productive measures, **China shows signs of
[insecurity]{.mark}** [and **fear**]{.mark} **of continued American
hegemony** and [an **inability to satisfy its resource need**s
under]{.mark} the continued **unipolar [American-led world
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China seeks to enhance its global power
position based on a "power-as-resources" strategy, circumventing
international institutions in the polar regions and elsewhere to serve
as potential cornerstones to securing resources to satisfy this
thirst.^95^

China is demonstrating strategic ambitions of challenging American
hegemony. To meet its power-as-resources goal, Beijing's ambitious,
entitled, self-righteous government and military pursue global influence
via international infrastructure investments to stay relevant on the
global stage. China's approach to global influence through
infrastructure investments and debt-trap diplomacy creates new spaces of
power. Chinese actions have met the necessary preconditions for
realization of the Thucydides Trap. While this so-called trap is an
abstract academic conceptualization, we should consider its
applicability to the polar regions.

*Russian Conditions*

While the Chinese only recently developed polar policies and military
capabilities, Russia began its own polar pivot in 2001. It began with
Russia filing the first of three unsuccessful (to date) territorial
shelf claims to the United Nations seeking to extend its exclusive
economic rights from the coast to the North Pole.^96^ In 2007, Russia
demonstrated its Arctic capability and intent by symbolically planting
its flag on the geographic North Pole Arctic seabed.^97^ Such Russian
symbolism extends to Antarctica as well. In 2004, Russia built an
Orthodox church at one of its Antarctic research stations. As a
year-round operation, the church holds services for Russian researchers
and is a visible demonstration of Moscow's sustainable presence and
influence on the continent.^98^ These self-important efforts have
dovetailed with expanded military infrastructure projects in the Arctic,
hostile actions in Georgia and Ukraine, and disingenuous claims that
American military forces deployed to the Baltics are a threat to Russian
sovereignty.^99^

In raising concerns about US actions, Russia feeds the narrative that
the United States is a global bully. President Putin's continued
anti-Western rhetoric advances the argument that Russia seeks
alternative institutional structures whereby the United States no longer
serves as the default leader in geopolitical affairs and where Moscow
enjoys status as a regional hegemon over Eurasia and the Arctic.

Russian sense of entitlement and self-importance mirrors that of the
Chinese, but [[given]{.mark} **geographic [proximity]{.mark}**,
**coastal access**, [and **economic importance**]{.mark}, **[Russian
ambitions are focused in the Arctic]{.mark}** rather than seeking
**global eminence**]{.underline}. [Moscow's aggressive
posture]{.underline} toward the Northern Sea Route and threats to use
military force against ships refusing to meet Russian requirements
[indicate its intent to control]{.underline} what it believes is legally
Russia's---what Russia is *entitled* to control.^100^ Such actions are a
direct challenge to freedom of navigation and Washington's desire to
command the commons toward this end, but Moscow pursues its agenda with
supposed economic intent.

Approximately 20 percent of the Russian economy is dependent on the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** located there
[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} enduring [interest for Russia to continue
its contested claims to the high north]{.underline}. With the Russian
economy tied the "primordial homeland," the Arctic is [a vital national
interest]{.underline}. Considering Russian economic dependence on
natural resources, this Arctic interest is one of survival as Moscow
seeks alternative means to support the economy and declining population.
This, coupled with Russia's plans to link its control of the Northern
Sea Route with China's Polar Silk Road, indicates a major initiative to
influence and control evolving Arctic economic
activities.^101^ Expanding Russian Arctic military infrastructure will
make this a natural outcome, as the country's unfettered ability to
operate in the region will give its power to dictate Arctic rules.

Following the reopening of Cold War--era Arctic military bases and an
expanded Arctic footprint, Russia's intent to militarize the Arctic and
secure its security interests is broadly advertised. Such a rapid and
extensive military infrastructure investment in a targeted region
indicates insecurity fueled by a desire to control and exercise
sovereignty throughout the high north. Russia's fear of losing---or
intent to maintain---Arctic influence is undeniable.^102^ Adding to
their physical infrastructure, the Russians have reorganized northern
military units and expanded their Arctic asset portfolio in attempts to
assert military dominance in the region. The Northern Fleet is the
"largest, most powerful, and most modern" of the Russian naval forces
with daily activity throughout the Arctic, though it is not a large
fleet in comparison to US naval fleets.^103^ In Antarctica, Russia
leverages its status as an ATS signatory to influence Antarctic
operations in pursuit of its own objectives, despite disagreements with
New Zealand and others.^104^

Moscow demonstrated its assertiveness with the December 2019
announcement about operational hypersonic missile deployments in the
Arctic.^105^ Beyond this, Russia's icebreaker fleet is the largest in
the world and growing; it has extensive air defense and electronic
warfare capabilities; and its concern about American ballistic missile
submarine deployments is well known.^106^ As Russia expands the "Ice
Curtain," fear and insecurity fuel a military deterrent project in the
Arctic. In other words: **[Russia seeks [an
aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline}**-*looking* **[Arctic military
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deter others and to maintain access
to resources. Russia's economic instability and dependence on the
Arctic's natural resources makes influence over the region imperative
for future national growth and sustainment. However, military expansion
alone does not indicate hostile intent.

There is credence to the idea that Arctic conflict is the last thing
Russia wants, because war would degrade Russia's economic stability. But
a militarily ambitious Russia in the Arctic---perhaps seeking only to
deter others---has had the opposite effect. Rather than preventing
increased militarization from NATO, the United States and its allies
have expanded their Arctic postures and orientation. The security
dilemma is now a polar dilemma. [Russian Arctic aggression rises to
Thucydidean proportion [with]{.mark} indicators of **[intent to
aggress]{.mark}** toward a situation in which the United States is in a
regionally subordinate role.]{.underline}

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} potential or attempted [[shift in the balance
of power]{.underline}]{.mark}---as Allison observed in his chosen
cases---among today's rivals [**[grows more]{.mark} likely [with
each]{.mark} passing [year]{.mark}** [of **investments** in **Arctic
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Applying Allison's framework to the
polar regions illustrates a rising Chinese power intent on securing
influence in both the Arctic and Antarctica by way of polar flying
squadrons, the Polar Silk Road policy, expanding investment in Greenland
and Iceland, and a self-proclaimed label as a "near-Arctic state."
Likewise, Russia's widening and contested claims to Arctic territory,
combined with its buildup of military infrastructure---to secure its
posture and interest in the region---make for an equally compelling
concern indicative of an increasingly self-important state motivated in
part by fear and insecurity. In this context, competing interests and
actions toward the polar regions to date are beginning to meet
Thucydides's two preconditions for realization of this trap.

Avoiding an American Polar Trap

Critics of Allison's Thucydides Trap argue his vision of hegemony's rise
and fall is too static, that it lacks nuance and consideration for the
unique aspects of each period and the relative dynamics shaping
competition and conflict decisions. Despite the critiques, Allison's
frame is a useful heuristic for considering the potentialities of
great-power war stemming from polar-region confrontation and conflict.
Just as German efforts toward "political hegemony and maritime
ascendancy" threatened England in the early pre--World War I era,
simultaneous---and sometimes complementary---Chinese and Russian efforts
to reject the current international system threaten American
hegemony.^107^

Debates over the extent and intent of Chinese and Russian ambition
continue. Whether they pose an existential threat to American hegemony
is also debatable, but what is not debatable is that the levels of
Chinese and Russian polar presence, power, posture, and policy dwarf
those of the United States. There is a growing literature arguing that
the US-backed world order is in decline and that Russia and China are
the principal challengers to the ecology of this order---seeking to
write the obituary to US hegemony. For those who reject notions of
conflict with Russia or China, we know that it "makes no sense to think
that hegemonic systems, or international orders more generally, will
ever be free from violence and coercion."^108^

The evolving situation in the polar regions is indicative of China and
Russia's intent to challenge the status quo. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark}
continued [**[US inaction]{.mark}** toward the polar regions,
[**Russian** and Chinese]{.mark} geostrategic [**advantages will
increase**, and]{.mark} the **[capabilities gap will widen]{.mark}** to
an insurmountable distance. This could [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} an
American [**[catastrophe]{.mark}** if a **polar crisis**
occurred.]{.underline}

### Arctic---Chinese aggression

#### Yes Chinese Arctic policy is aggressive. Arctic coop is a stepping zone to global ambitions---proven by FONOPS and militarized presence.

Turn" *Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik Comment* 2025/C 08, 4 Seiten.

State and party leader [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping [announced China's ambition
to become a "major polar power]{.mark}" in 2014,]{.underline} following
the People's Re­public being granted observer status in the Arctic
Council the year before. Xi ex­plained that the goal of becoming a polar
power was an important component of becoming a great maritime power.
[This ambition re­flects the new self-confidence of the People's Republic
and its global reach. China has diverse interests, including stra­tegic
inter­ests in the Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctic. As part of the Belt
and Road Initiative, [[the **Arctic**]{.mark} Ocean [is]{.mark}
considered [the third Silk Road corridor]{.mark}]{.underline} -- after
the land corridor through Central Asia and the maritime Indo-Pacific Sea
route to the European Mediterranean.

As with other applicants, China's scientific engagement was one of the
reasons why the Arctic states supported its admis­sion as an observer
state in 2013. According to this argument, China wants to create an
opportunity for cooperation through science and research. Its arrival in
the Arctic ap­pears to be a simple and inevitable con­sequence of the
country's growing global interests. Others emphasise that China has been
active in the Arctic for a long time, and that it was only the global
community's growing interest in China and the Arc­tic that has brought
this to light. According to that line of thinking, the country's
inter­ests have changed less than external per­ceptions have. In reality,
for example, the current level of Chinese investments in the Arctic is
not very remarkable. Iceland's former president Ólafur Ragnar Grimsson
(1996--2016) commented that, with the exception of the Russian Arctic,
where China is increasingly present, it is very difficult to find a
single example of a major Chinese investment. One reason for this is
that most Arctic states have rejected such projects, like the recent
engagement of China's state-owned shipping giant COSCO in Kirkenes,
which wants to become the European Singapore in an ice-free future. This
makes Chinese-Russian cooperation in the Arctic all the more important,
as it links an emerg­ing world power with the largest Arctic player,
which is increasingly falling into the role of junior partner, and thus
into a posi­tion of dependency. In addition to long-term interests, one
of the main factors for the increased activity and inter­est in the
Arctic is Russia's weakness as a result of its war of aggression against
Ukraine.

China is one of the few beneficiaries of the war. This is leading to
Russia's dimin­ished junior role, as Vladimir Putin's sub­missive
behaviour during Xi's visit to Mos­cow in March 2023 revealed: In the
pursuit of more power, Putin has weakened his country. In exchange for
supporting the war, [China can now acquire oil and gas more cheaply,
gain better access to natural resources and acquire sensitive Russian
military technology. It can also expect a friendlier Russian attitude to
its ideas of Arctic governance as well as to its steadily growing
presence]{.underline} in politically sensitive geographical areas, such
as the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and the Northern Sea Route
(NSR).

China's Arctic diplomacy

[[Beijing has]{.mark} visibly [strengthened its diplo­matic
presence]{.mark} in northern countries since 2014; the People's Republic
has the largest embassy in Reykjavik. The government's White Paper on
the Arctic, [in]{.mark} which China describes itself as a "Near Arctic
State"]{.underline}, [emphasises]{.underline} the foundations of
[[Arctic gov­er­nance]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the Arctic Council,
the Con­vention on the Law of the Sea and the Polar Code.
[They]{.underline} [serve as **[starting points for more far-reaching
ambitions.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Beijing sees the Arctic as a geopolitically important area]{.underline}
that will gain significance in the long term. As in the Pacific,
[**[Beijing can test]{.mark} its [global ambitions]{.mark}** [and see
whether new norms will be accepted]{.mark} there.]{.underline} As an
observer country to the Arctic Council, China is "overwhelmingly the
most active". Because the Arctic is not as regulated as the Antarctic,
it provides a good testing ground. However, the approach to the Arctic
(inter­nationalisation) vs. the South China Sea (nationalisation) is
being met with resistance from the Arctic states. Attempts to acquire
land in Finland, seaports in Norway and Sweden, or airports in Greenland
and associated infrastructure projects have also all failed. Although
the level of Chinese direct investment in Russia is increasing, it
remains at a low level in the non-Russian Arctic. However, Chinese
investors close to state interests continue to try to buy land in the
Arctic, most recently in June 2024 in Søre Fagerfjord, south of
Longyearbyen on the Svalbard archipelago. Oslo prevented this due to
security concerns. Many such un­successful ventures have been documented
as "lively debates" continue in China about the benefits of such
acquisitions. Military applications would also contradict the declared
goal of "peaceful development".

The precarious balance between the Arctic states and an emerging
superpower is also evident in science diplomacy. Whereas the Arctic
states want to integrate and social­ise the People's Republic without
conflict through research cooperation, China is striv­ing to expand its
position as an indepen­dent player without raising concerns in the Arctic
states. China has maintained a re­search station in Ny-Ålesund on
Svalbard since 2004. In 2018, Iceland and China opened the joint
research station China-Nordic Arctic Research Center (CNARC) in Karhóll.
There they operate the China-Ice­land Arctic Observatory (CIAO). The
pro­posal for a similar project in Greenland was rejected by Denmark for
security reasons. Chinese investments in expensive research
infrastructure have not only been welcomed in Iceland, but also
establish a presence and build trust. China needs both in order to gain
influence. However, China's activities are now also being viewed more
critically in Iceland, because China's scien­tific presence is not
without intent. In terms of the strate­gy of civil-military fusion, it
serves to further its military ambitions, for example in the form of
oceanographic and hydroacoustic investigations, similar to those
previously carried out in the South China Sea.

Sino-Russian cooperation

When Xi presented the Belt and Road Ini­tiative in October 2013, this
project had two eponymous aspects: A belt would encircle the Eurasian
continent, and a (water) road would stretch from the Indian Ocean via
the Suez Canal to Europe. The additional polar route is intended to
increase the national security of supply with fossil energy from the
Russian Arctic, as almost 80 per cent of oil imports are transported via
the Strait of Malacca. The sea route through the Arctic Ocean enables
transit traffic without ships having to pass through this strait, which
can be blocked by the United States in the event of a conflict. How­ever,
this also applies to the Bering Strait. It is therefore more of a
diversification of geostrategic dependencies. In China's project, Russia
acts primarily as a willing supplier of raw materials and is a recipient
of valuable investments, for which it must meet high standards.

However, the income from Chinese energy imports is clearly not enough
for the Kremlin. Russia is also using old tankers that are unsuitable
for the Arctic to circum­vent sanctions. Around 80 per cent of Russian
crude oil exports are transported by Putin's "shadow fleet". After the
ships have picked up oil or gas, their trail usually disappears, either
by being reloaded at sea or transponders being switched off. The first
accident occurred in July 2024, when the *Ceres I* collided with another
tanker in the South China Sea, apparently due to an incorrect location.

China not only gains more access, but even partial control over Russia's
NSR. During the state visit to Beijing in March 2023, it was decided to
create a joint umbrella organisation for shipping traffic in the NSR.
The cooperation agreement in the NSR between the China Coast Guard and
Russian border guards in Murmansk in April 2023 is based on this; the
Murmansk Memorandum mentions joint efforts in the fight against
terrorism, illegal migration, smuggling and illegal fishing. The first
joint patrol in the NSR took place in October 2024. China's Coast Guard
stated that this first operation had "effectively expanded the scope of
the Coast Guard's maritime deployment, thoroughly tested the ships'
ability to carry out missions in uncharted waters, and strongly
supported active participation in international and regional maritime
governance". If more and more Chinese ships are using the NSR, is it now
an international waterway that is also open to other countries? Its
opening raises many questions that are neither pleasant nor easy for
Russia. Added to this is the opening of the Pacific Arctic to Chinese
commercial activities in the home port of the Russian Pacific Fleet in
Vladivostok, which acts as the Pacific gatekeeper of the NSR, like
Murmansk and the Northern Fleet in the Arctic--North Atlantic area.

Arctic security policy

China's Arctic White Paper makes no men­tion of military security.
However, as the Communist Party of China's army, the armed forces are an
integral part of China's ambitions to become a "great polar power".

[The ability of China to project its maritime power to the North
American coast was demonstrated by **[five warships]{.mark}** when they
[crossed US waters]{.mark} in the 12-mile zone [off Alaska]{.mark} for
the first time [in]{.mark} September **[2015]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
the first "Freedom of Navigation" operation in Chinese history. [In the
same year, **a naval task force visited Denmark, Finland and Sweden**
for the first time.]{.underline} [[Since 2021]{.mark}, [Chinese warships
have repeatedly cruised off the Alaskan coast]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in
Septem­ber 2022, three warships operated along with five Russian ships
almost 160 kilo­metres from Kiska, an Aleutian Island. [Among them was
the Type 055 *Nanchang* guided missile destroyer, which is
[armed]{.mark} [with]{.mark} up to 112 **[cruise]{.mark}** missiles
**[or hypersonic]{.mark}** anti-ship **[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
North America is no longer a sanctuary, and [such an action is
recognised as **[an attack possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. US
Presi­dent Donald Trump's strange observation that "you don't even need
binoculars -- you look outside. You have China ships all over the place"
is a product of those opera­tions.

Particular attention is being paid to Chinese-Russian military
cooperation. How­ever, bilateral relations at the civilian and military
levels are as close as they are contra­dictory. For the Chinese military,
Russia's armed forces have been an important source for providing
doctrinal, operational and military technology experience since Soviet
times. They still have an edge, which they gained over decades from
dealing with the United States as a potential adversary.

In 2023, a US study team found that, although political and military
consultation mechanisms had developed between Russia and China,
military-technical cooperation and joint military activities had not
ex­panded. Joint projects include a conventional submarine, tactical
missiles and Russian support in the development of an early warning
system for missile launches. With the exception of aircraft engines,
China can now produce nearly all of its military equipment itself.

**[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Russian [long-range [bombers
patrolled the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean near]{.underline} the US state of
[Alaska [in]{.mark} July [2024]{.mark}]{.underline}. Two Russian Tu-95
strategic bombers and two Chinese Xian H-6 bombers took off from the
Russian airport Anadyr in Chukotka and undertook patrol flights over the
Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. There had already
been speculation years before that such joint patrols along the Alaskan
coast would be conceivable in the event of a deepening of bilateral
relations.

[[The US]{.mark} Navy]{.underline} also [[expects]{.mark} "[increasing
Chinese naval deployments in,]{.mark} under and over [Arctic
waters]{.mark}". [Beijing could use **sub**­]{.mark}marine**[s]{.mark}**
in the Arctic--North Atlantic area **[to secure its position as a global
military power and directly threaten the United States from the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However, [this]{.underline}
would not only shake Russia's supremacy, but [could]{.underline} also
[**provoke worrying military countermeasures** from the United
States.]{.underline}
