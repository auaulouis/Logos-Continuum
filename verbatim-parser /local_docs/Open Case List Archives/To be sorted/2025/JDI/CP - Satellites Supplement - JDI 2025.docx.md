WASHINGTON --- [[Amid a growing focus on low Earth orbit satellites, the
U.S. Space Force is making strides in a more traditional space-based
capability: large missile-warning satellites.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) program,
with an estimated cost of \$14 billion, is among the most expensive
satellite procurement efforts in the Space Force today. [[These massive
satellites play a crucial role in detecting missile launches and
providing early warnings of potential threats to U.S. military forces
and allied nations.]{.underline}]{.mark} Despite the trend towards
smaller, cheaper satellites, the Next-Gen OPIR program underscores the
military's reliance on high-altitude, persistent observation sensors in
geostationary and highly elliptical orbits. Progress amid complexity
[[Raytheon delivered the first of two infrared
payloads]{.underline}]{.mark} for Next-Gen OPIR geosynchronous (GEO)
satellites [[last month, marking a key milestone in the
program.]{.underline}]{.mark} Lockheed Martin is building these
satellites, with the [[Space Force now expecting the first GEO satellite
to be delivered in late 2025]{.underline}]{.mark}. Frank Calvelli, the
Space Force's top procurement official, said contractors are meeting
milestones and development timelines for Next-Gen OPIR at a faster pace
than previous systems like SBIRS (Space-Based Infrared System). "Current
production time has been reduced by 50 percent for Next-Gen OPIR GEO
when compared to SBIRS' initial development," Calvelli said in a
statement to SpaceNews. The Next-Gen OPIR program, initiated in 2018,
includes two GEO and two polar satellites in highly elliptical orbits.
Northrop Grumman, leading the polar-orbit satellite program, "has been
meeting its planned milestones to date," according to Calvelli. The
first polar satellite, scheduled for launch in 2028, is seen as crucial
for monitoring missile threats via Northern Hemisphere routes. Col.
Robert Davis, program executive for space sensing at the Space Systems
Command, described the delivery of the first GEO payload as a "key
event" in the program. "[[We're integrating it right
now]{.underline}]{.mark}," Davis told reporters last week, adding that
if tests go well, [[the Space Force remains on track to potentially
launch the first GEO satellite in late 2025.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office has warned of potential
technical and schedule risks, citing flight hardware production and
integration challenges due to supply chain issues and the complexity of
integrating a novel payload. A layered approach While advocating for a
shift to smaller, cheaper satellites leveraging commercial production
lines, Calvelli stressed that some space missions still require "larger,
low volume satellite systems." He emphasized that Next-Gen OPIR "fills a
critical need for the missile warning mission and is the last low
volume, large sized Space Force OPIR acquisition in the near future." In
parallel with Next-Gen OPIR, [[the Pentagon is also investing in LEO and
medium Earth orbit (MEO) missile-warning systems as part of a broader
strategy to develop a layered missile warning
architecture.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
multi-orbit strategy [[aims to counter sophisticated missile threats,
including hypersonic glide vehicles and advanced ballistic missiles from
adversaries like Russia and China.]{.underline}]{.mark} "A multilayer
architecture is the right thing to do if you look at the resiliency
calculations in some of the areas where we're concerned about," said Rob
Mitrevski, vice president at L3Harris Technologies, a primary contractor
for LEO missile-tracking spacecraft the company is producing for a
proliferated constellation overseen by the Space Development Agency.
While GEO satellites provide persistent, global coverage, much of the
technological innovation in missile detection and tracking is occurring
in LEO satellites, Mitrevski said at the recent Air Space & Cyber
Conference. These lower-flying **[[satellites can be deployed in larger
numbers, at lower costs, and offer advantages in agility and
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he said. LEO [[sensors can more
easily leverage AI for threat identification]{.underline}]{.mark}, he
added, allowing for quicker responses to emerging threats such as
hypersonic missiles Jeff Schrader, vice president at Lockheed Martin
Space, highlighted the incorporation of "smart sat" technology in LEO
missile-tracking satellites that the company is producing for the Space

[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hief of [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}pace
[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}perations Gen. B. Chance [[Saltzman is confident
the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} defense industry [[can develop space-based
missile interceptors]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said in a prerecorded
interview that streamed March 20. Asked during the Defense One interview
about America's ability to solve perhaps the most complex, ambitious
part of President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" air and missile defense
system, Saltzman said he believed it would happen. "I am so impressed by
the innovative spirit of the American space industry," Saltzman said.
"I'm pretty convinced that we will be able to technically solve those
challenges." Acknowledging the complexity of what Space Force Lt. Gen.
Shawn Bratton has called "no joke of a physics problem," Saltzman said
the challenge will be immense. "There are a lot of technical
challenges," Saltzman said. "Because it's not just that we want
space-based interceptors. We want them in boost phase. We want them to
achieve their effects as far from the homeland as possible. So they've
got to be fast, they've got to be accurate." From the time a missile is
launched, operators will have just a minute or two---perhaps only
seconds---to launch a space-based interceptor. [[Interceptors in
low-Earth orbit will reach the target faster because they're
closer;]{.underline}]{.mark} the downside is that the closer the
interceptors are to Earth, the more of them will be needed to defend
against attack. [[The cost of a large constellation will be high, but
worthwhile]{.underline}]{.mark}, Saltzman argued. "I'm pretty sure
[[they're going to solve]{.underline}]{.mark} most of those [[technical
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}," Saltzman said. "So from that standpoint,
I think it's just about how fast can we leverage the technology and put
it in place and test it, get a demo out there so we can see what's
possible." "To say it's the responsibility of the U.S. government to
protect its citizens from emerging threats makes perfect sense to me,"
he said. "[[You]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[see countries like
\[China\] investing heavily in]{.underline}]{.mark} these kinds of
threats, [[whether]{.underline}]{.mark} it's [[hypersonic,
whether]{.underline}]{.mark} it's threats [[from
space]{.underline}]{.mark}. And so now it's time for the U.S. government
to step up to the responsibilities to protect American citizens from
those threats." Saltzman has previously said he the Space Force will
play a "central" role in Golden Dome, and on March 20, he argued that
integrating multiple agencies' efforts will be crucial. "That's a lot of
things coming together," he said. "So the biggest hurdle is integration.
How does it all fit together? Can we make such a large effort come
together seamlessly? ... Because things are going to be happening at
supersonic speeds. We've got to be able to make the right decisions and
put the right data in the right hands of the right shooters." Saltzman
did not say which agency should have the lead in that integration,
however. Commercial Strength Saltzman's confidence in industry was again
apparent as he discussed the Space Force's willingness to cancel or
abandon large, legacy programs in favor of smaller, commercial
solutions. Referring to USSF's Commercial Space Strategy, he emphasized
the service's commitment to standardization open systems. "We've really
committed to open architectures. We've really committed to industry
standards," he said. "[[We've committed to using commercial
products]{.underline}]{.mark} wherever we can: commercial busses and
satellites, etc. **[[What that's allowed is a level of interaction
between companies to support each other to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark}** mission capabilities." Now, in a bid to
control costs and encourage competition, he said the service is eyeing
new acquisition strategies. "If you break the requirements up, it allows
those entities to compete better," he said. "[[It doesn't have to be one
big, integrated program that's delivered. \[It can be\] a series of
programs that work together]{.underline}]{.mark}. Smaller programs seem
to go a little faster, because you can control the requirements. You
control the dollars that are spent. The **[[bigger programs start to get
a little more unwieldy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So every chance we get to
disaggregate the requirements as an opportunity to go a little faster,
be a little better stewards of taxpayer dollars."

Spending in the Broader Budget Debate",
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/prioritizing-air-and-missile-defense-spending-broader-budget-debate>
JBlock

President Donald Trump's January "Iron Dome for America" executive order
and subsequent planning for the Golden Dome architecture mark a
significant expansion of American missile defense policy.
[[Gen]{.underline}]{.mark}. Michael [[Gutlein]{.underline}]{.mark}, vice
chief of space operations for the U.S. Space Force, [[compared the scale
of the Golden Dome to the Manhattan Project, requiring a
whole-of-government effort.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is not, however,
the first time a Trump administration has set lofty goals for its
missile defense policy. Yet [[previous attempts to
invigorate]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. **[[missile defense fell
short]{.underline}]{.mark}** in part **[[due to the lack of
funding]{.underline}]{.mark}** to support them. Fundamentally, budgets
are about prioritization. Because resources are finite, spending must be
prioritized and, where priorities conflict, trade-offs are required.
Understanding these tradeoffs when planning the Golden Dome architecture
will help the administration better scope its efforts. Three levels of
decision-making or prioritization stand out as having influence over the
budget for Golden Dome: within the missile defense portfolio, in the
overall Department of Defense (DOD) capability mix, and across the
broader federal budget. [[The most expansive concepts for the Golden
Dome architecture will require]{.underline}]{.mark} making aligned
[[prioritization]{.underline}]{.mark} decisions across all three levels.
Analyzing the Golden Dome resourcing challenge begins with understanding
the size and makeup of the current air and missile defense portfolio.
Since 2009, DOD spending on air and missile defense modernization has
averaged a little over \$20 billion per year (Figure 1). Because air and
missile defense programs do not have their own spending title, this
figure requires a manual aggregation of program lines into an estimate
of overall modernization spending. Since 2018, average spending has been
over \$25 billion, with most of that growth coming from increased Army
and Space Force funding. The first level of prioritization is within the
Golden Dome architecture and the broader missile defense portfolio.
Based on both the executive order and reported guidance from Secretary
of Defense Pete Hegseth, the administration is likely to prioritize
increasing funding for homeland missile defense. On average, about 12
percent of air and missile defense funding has gone to homeland defense
since 2009 (Figure 2). Mixed-use air and missile defense systems, such
as space-based missile tracking sensors, make up 32 percent of spending,
and theater missile defense systems make up the remaining 56 percent.
This spending profile makes sense considering the scope of prior missile
defense policy; whereas DOD invested in theater defenses against the
full spectrum of air and missile threats, its **[[homeland defense
investments were limited to ballistic missile defense against
adversaries with limited capabilities, like North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Decisions about priorities within the
various mission sets of the Golden Dome architecture will determine the
magnitude of the shift towards spending on homeland defense. **[[Two
choices stand out as likely cost drivers: the scale
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** both the space-based interceptor (**[[SBI)
layer]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the homeland cruise missile defense
architecture. In each case, maximalist goals would increase the cost of
the Golden Dome effort considerably, which would increase the trade-offs
required. With regards to SBIs, although certain assumptions of prior
cost estimates have changed, other fundamental challenges remain.
Technological developments like reusable space launch vehicles and
miniaturization of key interceptor components like sensors, avionics,
and turbopumps have combined to reduce the cost of space launch and the
weight of each interceptor payload. These trends promise considerable
savings as compared to prior cost estimates of an SBI constellation.
Nevertheless, due to the physics of low Earth orbit, providing coverage
against larger salvos of missiles requires procuring significant numbers
of interceptors that might need to be refreshed every five years or so.
As a result, a [[maximalist SBI architecture could balloon in cost,
requiring]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[greater resource
allocation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The homeland cruise missile defense
component of Golden Dome faces a similar problem. Compared to SBIs,
cruise missile defense involves a relatively mature set of technologies,
but maximalist goals would again cause significant cost growth. Two
studies examining the costs of the homeland cruise missile defense
mission illustrate this problem. In 2021, the Congressional Budget
Office assessed that a maximal homeland cruise missile defense
architecture with coverage of the entire continental United States could
cost between \$77 and \$466 billion (in 2021 dollars) over a 20-year
period. By contrast, the Center for Strategic and International Studies
analyzed a more focused cruise missile defense architecture that
provided preferential defense to certain key areas, with a resulting
cost estimate of around \$32 billion (in 2023 dollars). Marginal
differences in the capabilities examined for each architecture explain
some of this variance, but the scale of defended area envisioned was by
far the biggest driver of cost savings. Some might be tempted to find
funding for more expansive homeland missile defense projects by
reallocating resources from theater defense programs. For example,
certain theater defense systems could be repurposed as part of the
homeland cruise missile defense architecture or a ballistic missile
defense underlay. However, the persistent demand for these assets will
constrain the ability to reallocate resources within the missile defense
portfolio without incurring strategic risk. The administration's
challenges in redirecting scarce theater missile defense assets from the
Indo-Pacific to the Middle East underscore this trade-off. Reallocating
theater defense systems to the homeland or reducing investments in their
capacity could meaningfully reduce the flexibility of the U.S. to deploy
forces in increasingly contested and missile-rich environments. These
homeland deployments also could have operational tempo implications for
the already stretched air and missile defense force structure. To
incorporate mature systems like Aegis, THAAD, and their associated
elements into homeland defense, DOD should consider a more distributed
and disaggregated approach, which could be less manning intensive.
Golden Dome could also be prioritized within the DOD budget by making
trade-offs between the missile defense portfolio and other capabilities.
Figure 3 shows that, relative to other capabilities, air and missile
defense funding has been prioritized at consistent levels since 2009,
accounting for between 7 and 9 percent of modernization spending. If the
Pentagon declines to make trade-offs within the missile defense
portfolio itself, funding for Golden Dome programs might require cuts to
other operations or capabilities. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's
February memo seeking realignment of \$50 billion suggests the Pentagon
is already exploring this option. [[The **largest challenge**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} resourcing [[Golden Dome]{.underline}]{.mark}
through internal DOD budget reallocation **[[is finding meaningful
funding]{.underline}]{.mark}** that can be cut easily. Budget exercises
conducted by the American Enterprise Institute using the Hegseth memo
constraints have required significant cuts to the Army and additional
cuts to Air Force programs. Attempts to trim spending on older systems
are likely to face congressional opposition, and previous
administrations have already picked much of the low-hanging fruit. This
suggests that trying to fund Golden Dome through internal reallocations
alone would either yield too few resources for the supposedly
transformational effort to succeed, or create unacceptable risk to other
DOD priorities.

Reports indicate the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration could

at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center, featuring other
lawmakers and experts in space science. The Planetary Society, founded
in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Louis Friedman, and Bruce Murray, advocates for

the organization's current CEO and longtime host of popular science
education TV show, "Bill Nye the Science Guy," at the event. "It's a
problem once again, more than ever." The significance of recent space
science The podcast guests stressed the importance of exploration,
noting that the [[breakthroughs in planetary science and technological
innovations have expanded our knowledge in once unimaginable
ways.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist and chief
scientist of space exploration at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory (APL), shared her experiences working on projects such as
NASA's MESSENGER mission, which was the first spacecraft to orbit
Mercury in 2011. "I think this is what's interesting about space
science---[[nothing exists in isolation]{.underline}]{.mark}," Chabot
said. "Science and technology for space is not really separate from
science and technology for other uses. As all of this grows, you can
apply it to a whole variety of different things." Chabot also worked on
NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which launched a
spacecraft into an asteroid to adjust its speed and path. Chabot
explained that asteroids are a "cosmic inevitability," which prompted
this mission. They have hit the Earth in the past, and they will hit the
Earth in the future, so scientists are testing possible solutions. DART
garnered worldwide attention, with more than a million people watching
the collision in real-time in 2022. "[[Science and technology for space

2028, the mission will send a car-sized, nuclear-powered octocopter,
built and operated by APL, to examine areas of the Saturn moon Titan,
exploring its organic-rich dunes and collecting results to advance our
understanding of life in the universe. Despite potential budget cuts,
space can be bipartisan Although many in the space community are
concerned about potential budget cuts, Whitesides and Rep. Judy Chu,
D-Calif., who have both spent much of their careers advocating for
scientific research, emphasized that space exploration remains a
bipartisan issue for many lawmakers. "[[We are in such a crisis right

aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of
humans' historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade
spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of
which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which
humans have created in the many different environments in which they
live. Success of such **[[extra-terrestrial settlements]{.mark} will
have the]{.underline}** additional [**benefit of [reduc]{.mark}ing [the
danger of human extinction]{.mark}** **[due to]{.mark} planet-wide or
cosmic [accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[27\]. **[These horrors
include]{.underline}** both man-made disasters such as **[[nuclear war,

and natural disasters such as **[[super-volcanoes]{.mark} or

**[Weapons developed in recent decades are so

effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as
possible]{.underline}** by the international community. Hence,
**[[reducing the incentive to use]{.mark} these [weapons]{.mark} by

surely **[equally [important]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[11,16\]. [The
achievement of this [**depends on low**]{.mark} space travel
**[costs]{.mark}** which]{.underline}, at the present time, [appear to
be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism
industry]{.underline}. 8. Summary. As discussed above, if space travel
services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enor-
mously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop
passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans'
technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path
which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as
intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply
services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of
the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and
suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the
resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased. In
response, **[policies should be implemented urgently]{.underline}** to
correct this error, and **[to catch up with the
possibilities]{.underline}** for industrial and economic growth that
have been ignored for so long. **[This policy renewal is urgent because
of the [growing dangers of]{.mark}]{.underline}** unemployment, economic
stagnation, **[environmental [pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
educational **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** cultural decline[,
**[resource wars]{.underline}**]{.mark} and loss of civil liberties
**[which face civilisation today]{.underline}**. In order to achieve the
necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between
those working in the two fields of civil aviation and civil space.
Although the word ''aerospace'' is widely used, it is largely a misnomer
since these two fields are in practice quite separate. True
''aerospace'' collaboration to realise passenger space travel will
develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. 8.1.
Heaven or hell on Earth? As discussed above, **[the claim that the
Earth's [resources]{.mark} are [running out is used to justify wars
which may never end]{.mark}]{.underline}**: present-day rhetoric about
''the long war' 'or ''100 years war'' in Iraq and Afghanistan are
current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint,
the recent aggression by the rich ''Anglo-Saxon'' countries, and their
cutting back of traditional civil liberties, are ominous for the future.
However, [**this** ''hellish'' vision of endless war **is based on an
assumption about**]{.underline} a single number---**[the future cost of
travel to orbit]{.underline}**---**[about which a different assumption
leads to a ''heavenly'' vision of peace and ever-rising living standards
for everyone]{.underline}**. **[[If this cost
stays]{.underline}]{.mark}** above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been
**[[unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}** for nearly 50years, **[the
[prospects]{.mark} for humanity [are bleak]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[But [if humans]{.mark} make the necessary effort,]{.underline}** and
use the tiny amount of resources needed **[to [develop vehicles]{.mark}
for passengers space travel, then this cost will fall]{.underline}** to
100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become
economic, [**and** arguments for **[resource wars will evaporate]{.mark}
entirely**]{.underline}. The main reason why this has not yet happened
seems to be lack of understanding of the myriad opportunities by
investors and policy-makers. **[Now that the potential]{.underline}** to
catch up half a century of delay in the growth **[of space travel is
becoming understood, continuing to spend]{.underline}** 20 billion
Euro-equivalents/year **[on government space activities,
while]{.underline}** **[continuing to invest nothing in developing
passenger space travel, would be a gross failure of economic
policy]{.underline}**, and strongly contrary to the economic and social
interests of the public. **[Correcting this error]{.underline}**, even
after such a costly delay, **[will ameliorate many problems in the world
today]{.underline}**. **[As this policy error is corrected, and
investment in]{.underline}** **[profitable space projects
grows]{.underline}** rapidly in coming years[**, we can look forward to
a** growing world-wide boom]{.underline}. Viewed as a whole, humans'
industrial activities have been seriously underperforming for decades,
due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising fields of
activity. **[The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in

acknowledged those challenges, but also made clear that he felt they
were surmountable. "I think there's a lot of technical challenges," he
said. "I am so impressed by the innovative spirit of the American space
industry. I'm pretty convinced that we will be able to technically solve
those challenges." "We've got a pretty amazing space industrial base and
I'm pretty sure they're going to solve most of those technical
problems," he continued. "So, from that standpoint, I think it's just
about how fast you want to go, you know, how fast can we leverage the
technology, and put it in place and test it, \[and\] get a demo out
there so you can see what's possible." Saltzman also addressed broader
concerns about the potentially destabilizing impacts of [[weaponizing
space]{.underline}]{.mark}. Space Force's top officer countered, as he
and other American officials have in the past, by highlighting examples
of how this [[is already happening. China and Russia, in
particular]{.underline}]{.mark}, have significant and still-expanding
arsenals of space-based and terrestrial anti-satellite capabilities.
"Depends on where you sit, right, you know? But to say that it's the
responsibility for the U.S. government to protect its citizens from
emerging threats makes perfect sense to me," Saltzman said. "And we
clearly see a country like the PRC \[People's Republic of China\]
investing heavily in these kinds of threats, whether it's hypersonic
\[weapons\], whether it's threats from space. And so now it's time for
the U.S. government to step up to the responsibilities to protect
American citizens from those threats." Saltzman's comments here notably
follow Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. Michael Guetlein's remarks at
the McAleese and Associates annual Defense Programs Conference earlier
this week about how China especially is expanding its ability to
'dogfight' in space. "There are five different objects in space
maneuvering in and out around each other, in synchronicity and in
control. That's what we call dogfighting in space," Guetlein said,
according to Breaking Defense. "They are practicing tactics, techniques,
and procedures to do on-orbit space operations from one satellite to
another." "Gen. Guetlein referenced Chinese satellite maneuvers observed
in space. China conducted a series of proximity operations in 2024
involving three Shiyan-24C experimental satellites and two Chinese
experimental space objects, the Shijian-6 05A/B," a Space Force
spokesperson subsequently clarified to that outlet. "These maneuvers
were observed in low Earth orbit. These observations are based on
commercially available information." "Unfortunately, our [[current
adversaries are willing to go against international norms of behavior,
go against that gentleman's agreement, and they're willing to do it in
very unsafe and unprofessional manners]{.underline}]{.mark}," Guetlein
also said, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. "The new norms of
behavior in space, unfortunately, within the past three years: jamming,
spoofing, dazzling ... cyber hacks are happening all around us on a
day-to-day basis." Space Force officials have publicly highlighted this
reality in the past. Saltzman has also already been a notably outspoken
advocate of treating space as just as much of a potential arena for
active warfare as the air, sea, and land below. He has also been among
those pushing for the U.S. military to acquire new so-called
"counter-space" capabilities, which could include additional types of
space-based weapon systems, as well as ones within Earth's atmosphere.
"What I think we're really recognizing is now [[space is a contested
war-fighting domain]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that's what's new, not
that the military is considering offensive and defensive operations,"
Saltzman said today. "[[Militaries always conduct offensive and
defensive operations to contest the domains to meet military
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}. We just recently had to up our game, if
you will, because space has become a warfighting domain."

9\. Conclusion The pursuit of Mars [[colonization]{.underline}]{.mark},
an ambition once nestled in the pages of science fiction, [[is now
evolving into a tangible goal within our
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[and scientific
reach]{.underline}]{.mark}. This paper has thoroughly explored the
multifaceted aspects necessary for establishing human habitation on
Mars, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that
intertwines environmental, technological, human, and economic
considerations. Central to the sustainability of Martian colonization is
the strategic use of in-situ resources, a key factor in reducing Earth
dependency and revolutionizing interplanetary settlement from both
logistical and economic perspectives. This approach opens doors to novel
economic opportunities and scientific discoveries, pivotal in making
Mars colonization feasible and viable. The human aspect of Mars
colonization is equally critical. Ensuring astronauts\' physical and
psychological well-being necessitates comprehensive strategies
encompassing advanced life support systems, psychological support, and
extensive training. The challenges of reduced gravity, isolation, and
adaptation to a new environment demand robust solutions prioritizing
Martian settlers\' health and safety.
**[[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [[advancements are the backbone
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Mars [[colonization. From
developing]{.underline}]{.mark} durable [[spacesuits and habitats to
establishing]{.mark}]{.underline} efficient [[energy and communication
systems, each techn]{.underline}]{.mark}ological [[breakthrough brings
us closer to realizing the goal of living on Mars]{.underline}]{.mark}.
However, these innovations must be specifically tailored to meet Mars\'s
unique challenges and conditions. Econo[[mically, the venture into Mars
colonization requires a pragmatic approach. Public and private
investments should be directed]{.mark}]{.underline} towards initiatives
that offer scientific and potential economic returns. The involvement of
the private sector and international collaboration is crucial for
funding this ambitious endeavor. The journey to Mars symbolizes
humanity\'s enduring spirit of exploration and quest for knowledge. [[It
marks a critical step in our expansion beyond
Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}, driven by our desire to understand the
universe, stimulate technological and scientific advancement, and
inspire future generations. The path is marked with complexities and
challenges, yet with collaborative efforts, innovative solutions, and
strategic planning, [[Mars colonization is within our]{.mark} potential
[reach]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper has outlined a feasible timeline
for this monumental endeavor, from preliminary unmanned missions for
resource assessment to short-term manned missions, eventually leading to
long-term, sustainable settlements. **[[As we stand on the brink of this
new era in human history, our actions and decisions must be guided by
caution, creativity, and unwavering commitment to scientific integrity
and ethical responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mars colonization
transcends the goal of establishing a human presence on another planet;
it represents a journey to broaden our cosmic understanding, catalyze
growth in various fields, and ignite people\'s imaginations worldwide.
[[The complexities and challenges are immense]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[but with collaborative effort, innovative solutions, and thoughtful
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}, the red sands of [[Mars could well be
within our reach,]{.underline}]{.mark} marking a monumental milestone in
our cosmic journey.

The Role of International Cooperation Given the scale and complexity of
the challenges involved in space colonization, [[international
cooperation will be essential]{.underline}]{.mark} for making this
vision a reality. No single nation or organization has the resources or
expertise to undertake this endeavor alone, and [[collaboration across
borders will be necessary to pool knowledge, share costs, and mitigate
risks.]{.mark}]{.underline} One model for international cooperation in
space is the International Space Station (ISS), which has been
continuously occupied by astronauts from multiple countries since 2000.
[[The ISS has demonstrated the feasibility of long-duration human
spaceflight and has served as a platform for groundbreaking
scientific]{.underline}]{.mark} research and technology
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Building on the success of the ISS,
future space colonization efforts could involve similar multilateral
partnerships, with nations and organizations working together to
establish shared infrastructure, conduct joint missions, and coordinate
research and development activities. Another important aspect of
international cooperation in space will be the development of common
standards and protocols for space operations, including safety,
communications, and data sharing. This will be particularly important as
more nations and private companies enter the space arena, and as the
number of objects and activities in orbit continues to grow.
Establishing clear rules and guidelines for responsible behavior in
space will be essential for avoiding conflicts and ensuring the
long-term sustainability of space activities. The Importance of Public
Engagement and Education As [[space colonization moves from the realm of
science fiction to reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, it will be crucial to
engage the public in this process and ensure that the benefits and risks
are widely understood and debated. This will require a concerted effort
to improve science education and outreach, particularly in fields
related to space exploration and technology. One key aspect of public
engagement will be to inspire the next generation of scientists,
engineers, and explorers who will lead the charge in space colonization.
This could involve expanding opportunities for students to participate
in space-related research and internships, as well as developing
educational programs and resources that make space science accessible
and engaging for learners of all ages and backgrounds. Another important
aspect of public engagement will be to foster open and inclusive
dialogue about the social, ethical, and political implications of space
colonization. This could involve public forums, citizen science
initiatives, and other participatory mechanisms that allow diverse
voices and perspectives to shape the direction and priorities of space
exploration. By involving the public in these conversations, we can
ensure that space colonization reflects the values and aspirations of
humanity as a whole, rather than just a narrow set of interests. Summary
The [[colonization of space]{.underline}]{.mark} represents a grand
challenge for humanity, one that will test the limits of our
technological capabilities, economic resources, and social and political
will. Yet, it also [**[offers a profound opportunity to secure the
long-term future of our species, expand the frontiers of knowledge and
discovery, and create a more]{.mark}** abundant and **[sustainable
civilization both on Earth and beyond.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Mark his words. [Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada
and the Bank of England, will become the next Canadian prime minister
this week,]{.underline} after he was elected leader of the Liberal Party
by a landslide on Sunday. In his victory speech, Carney had hockey
skate--sharp words for Canada's southern neighbor[. "**[America is not
Canada]{.mark}**. And **[Canada never]{.mark}, ever will [be part of
America in any way]{.mark}, shape, or form**," Carney said in response
to US President Donald Trump]{.underline}, who has threatened tariffs
and floated the idea of Canada becoming the fifty-first US state. He
added, "[We [didn't ask for this fight,]{.mark} but **[Canadians]{.mark}
are [always ready]{.mark}** when someone else drops the
gloves."]{.underline} So, what's next for Carney, who takes office ahead
of a required national election before October 20? And what's next for
the Washington-Ottawa relationship? Below, Atlantic Council experts
answer these questions and more. Central bankers are no strangers to
politics Think Carney's experience leading two different Group of Seven
(G7) central banks isn't relevant for his new role? Think again.
[[Carney]{.mark} wasn't just any central banker---**he [was a central
banker during multiple crises]{.mark}**.]{.underline} First, he led the
Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and won praise from
his colleagues for quick action on interest rates that helped Canada
weather the storm. In fact, he did such a good job that he became the
first non-Brit to lead the Bank of England. In that role, he had to lead
the bank through Brexit---one of the biggest shocks the UK economy has
experienced in decades. All of this [[prepares him]{.mark} quite well
[to handle]{.mark} the **toughest economic test** he has ever
faced---how to handle [a trade war with]{.mark} a neighbor who seemingly
**has much more leverage**.]{.underline} Carney has already highlighted
how [Canada will **use [US]{.mark} reliance on Canadian energy to try
and even the playing field. Perhaps**]{.underline} this is a negotiating
tactic and he will seek to reset US-Canada ties following the frosty
relationship between Trump and outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
But don't expect a pure technocratic approach despite his CV. [Remember,
[trade wars are also currency wars]{.mark}.]{.underline} The way a
country's currency appreciates or depreciates can have an enormous
impact on who bears the costs of tariffs. [And **[Carney]{.mark} is

**[AT: Arctic Sensing Key]{.underline}**

**Space-based sensor layer solves all missile threats**

Accessed: 6/26/25)---js

To leverage some of the obvious advantages space offers missile
defenders, the U.S. is adding missile-tracking satellites to its current
constellations of dedicated early warning spacecraft. [The MDR misses a
critical opportunity to tell its readers that these ongoing satellite
development efforts promise to significantly improve the ability of the
United States to defeat existing and emerging missile threats. With
Space Force and the SDA now in place and pursuing these development
efforts along with MDA, the country has an architectural foundation for
moving the country's missile tracking sensor center of gravity to
space---a plan and vision that should have been emphasized in the 2022
MDR.]{.underline} The **[[country]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} move beyond development and initial
deployments that will occur over the next few years to **[[fill
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[entire [architecture that is
envisioned]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[This]{.mark} not only will [require
**continued funding** and **advocacy**]{.mark} **for
satellite-**]{.underline} and ground-system [**development** but also
will require the country to put [**new emphasis** on]{.mark} the
development of **[responsive launch capabilities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[If the missile tracking and discrimination capability is to be fully
realized, the [satellites]{.mark} to be deployed will [need to be placed
in orbit in sufficient numbers and then **incrementally and periodically
replaced** w]{.mark}ith follow-on satellites.]{.underline} [There is a
growing warfighter requirement for integrated space sensors, not simply
to meet the newest missile and space threats but also to replace
increasingly obsolete terrestrial sensors]{.underline}.152 A
[[space-based sensor layer would **enable** the United States to **use
its interceptor** inventory more efficiently and effectively to counter
a broad array of threats, including hypersonic]{.mark} missile
threat[s.]{.mark}]{.underline}153 Yet efforts to deploy eyes in space to
enable global and persistent tracking of even the less challenging
in-flight ballistic missile threats have been on-again off-again and, in
the end, have not resulted in the deployment of a new operational
constellation. [While the absence of a cohesive missile defense vision
affects the entirety of the mission, the [lack of focus on the long-term
purpose of the mission will stunt the growth of missile defense
efforts]{.mark} in space]{.underline}. Space sensors are not weighed
down by the baggage associated with space-based interceptors, but
political problems stemming from the absence of a coherent vision still
may hinder their development and deployment. The lack of vision and
advocacy could derail programs currently under development, prevent them
from reaching their full potential, and stunt long-term acquisition
efforts and strategy development. [The [arguments for space arms control
could unduly restrain important sensor developments]{.mark},
particularly since those sensors could be used to help improve Space
Domain Awareness and execute counterspace operations. The absence of a
clear, coherent, national vision is a drag on the political momentum
needed to support defense activities in space, which will necessarily
impact funding of these important programs]{.underline}. A vision will
be needed to fund the Space Force at the appropriate level and maintain
stable programs. Space Force also must continue to fund the
missile-tracking sensor development and production work that is not
necessarily in its mission portfolio. Should attention to the missile
defense mission wane in Space Force or the DoD, funding and authority to
continue the necessary space sensor development work may be
compromised.154

Other [[possible components]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[include
an]{.underline}]{.mark} over-the-horizon-radar ([[OTHR), designed to
help spot low-flying, modern cruise missiles that can hug the curvature
of the earth to evade detection. The US is planning a joint Canadian
procurement to field new OTHR **with an eye toward the** Arctic as an
anticipated vector of attack for adversaries like
Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark} After originally planning to begin buying
the radars in fiscal year 2024, the Air Force deferred the OTHR
procurement out to FY26 to focus on "risk reduction" activities in the
meantime, the service told Breaking Defense in July. A public timeline
released by Ottawa calls for an Arctic OTHR system to be operational by
2028 as part of a twenty-year and \$38.6 billion CAD modernization
project for NORAD. "[[Canada and the US are committed to ensuring
interoperability in its OTHR initiatives --- and we are in active and
constant]{.underline}]{.mark} dialogue to ensure alignment in our
plans," the Canadian Defence Ministry told Breaking Defense in July.
"Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to bolster
NORAD's ability to detect threats earlier and more precisely and to
respond effectively."

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**does not** orient its missile

[[should **No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[[use a]{.mark} Fractional Orbiting Bombardment System
(**[FOBS]{.mark}**), [it would be able to]{.mark} take advantage of
Earth's orbit to **[skirt]{.mark}** around the missile **[defense
sensors]{.mark}** to deliver its payload]{.underline}. FOBS are
[designed to leverage approaches to the target that ballistic missiles
cannot take. The U[.S. must have sensors in space]{.mark} to address
this type of threat.]{.underline}

As discussed in Chapter 1, [while states will still develop and deploy
ballistic missiles, the [threat missiles of tomorrow will also become
more capable of undertaking unexpected maneuvers]{.mark}, which, with
the current sensor architecture, would cause the Missile Defense System
to lose track of the threat payloads]{.underline}.
[[Hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} missiles and FOB[S]{.mark} are the
**[[logical next]{.underline}]{.mark}** development
**[[steps]{.underline}]{.mark}** for some states. The more advanced
threat missiles, in fact, would not have to do major maneuvers to get
outside the field of view of current ground-based tracking radars, but
[their [ability to change up their speeds to mess with the defender's
fire control system would cause significant
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.44

Another [advantage derived from the use of [space sensors for missile
defense is **force protection**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The more the
sensor "center of gravity" moves to space, the [more complicated]{.mark}
and challenging it would be for an adversary [to attack]{.mark} those
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [a proliferated
constellation of satellites encircling the globe offers some built-in
protection. [Ground]{.mark}-based [radars]{.mark} are set up to cover
specific threat corridors, so the adversary [knows exactly where these
immobile targets]{.mark} are]{.underline}. [[In a shooting war, they
would undoubtedly be the **main targets**]{.mark} in the early stages of
the conflict. Absent a high-altitude nuclear explosion, [attacking
on-orbit space military assets]{.mark}, however, [would not be an easy
thing to do for **most nations**]{.mark}, although a nation could also
attack the heavily protected ground segment or the communications links
of a space system]{.underline}.45 [China and Russia have made strategic
choices to develop their space-power capabilities, already conducting
live anti- satellite tests in space and building capabilities that can
damage or destroy U.S. space assets]{.underline}.46 It is, however,
[**[more difficult]{.underline}** [to attack proliferated space
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Satellites are also
**moving**]{.underline}, which [further complicates the adversary's
ability to counter them]{.underline}.

A [**[networked system]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[terrestrial- and [space-based sensors is desirable because the various
sensors will provide multiple phenomenology]{.mark} and different data
to the system.]{.underline} In the decades ahead, the terrestrial
sensors will continue to provide a different look at the target and
provide more information to the system about it. Thus, the terrestrial
sensors currently contributing to the system will not necessarily go
away once additional tracking capability is moved into space.

[[There]{.mark} i[s]{.mark} also [a **basic physics** problem associated

advanced threats]{.underline}, [terrestrial **radars** [would **not** be
able to **acquire**]{.mark} the [incoming **targets** at sufficient
range]{.mark} because of the curvature of the Earth]{.underline}.
[[Radars]{.mark} essentially [look upwards]{.mark}, so that while they
can get a look at a ballistic missile 4,000 to 5,000 miles out, which
flies through space along a predictable trajectory, [when]{.mark} the
threat is [maneuvering]{.mark} in the atmosphere, [or flying on a

RESURS-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which Russia declared
dead in 2022. U.S. Space Command, tracking the debris swarm, said there
was no immediate threat to other satellites. The event took place about
noon EDT (1600 GMT) Wednesday, Space Command said. It occurred in an
orbit near the space station, prompting U.S. astronauts on board to
shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, NASA\'s Space Station
office said. Russian space agency Roscosmos, which operated the
satellite, did not respond to a request for comment or publicly
acknowledge the event on its social media channels. U.S. Space Command,
which has a global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite
immediately created \"over 100 pieces of trackable debris.\" By Thursday
afternoon, radars from U.S. space-tracking firm LeoLabs had detected at
least 180 pieces, the company said. Large debris-generating events in
orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with
satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband
internet and communications to basic navigation services, as well as
satellites no longer in use. The satellite\'s breakup was at an altitude
of roughly 355 km (220 miles) in low-Earth orbit, a popular region where
thousands of small to large satellites operate, including SpaceX\'s vast
Starlink network and China\'s station that houses three of its
astronauts. \"Due to the low orbit of this debris cloud, we estimate
it'll be weeks to months before the hazard has passed,\" LeoLabs said in
a statement to Reuters. The [[some 25,000 pieces of debris bigger than
10 cm]{.mark}]{.underline} (4 inches) [[in space caused
by]{.underline}]{.mark} satellite explosions [[or
collisions]{.underline}]{.mark} have raised concerns about the prospect
of a Kessler effect --- a phenomenon in which satellite collisions with
debris can create a cascading field of more hazardous junk and
exponentially increase crash risks. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
sparked strong criticism from the U.S. and other Western countries [[in
2021]{.underline}]{.mark} when it struck one of its defunct satellites
in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile launched from
its Plesetsk rocket site. The blast, testing a weapon system ahead of
Moscow\'s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, [[created thousands of pieces of
orbital debris]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Debris removal via ISS starting in '26, solves the disad.

[[A lightweight version of the I]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational

arm will help]{.mark}]{.underline} space sustainability company
Astroscale [[remove decades-old space junk from Earth\'s
orbit]{.underline}]{.mark} in the first mission of its kind. Astroscale,
which has offices in Japan and the U.K., previously ran a demonstration
of active space debris removal technology with its ELSA-d mission, which
in 2021 successfully captured a piece of simulated debris using a
magnetic system. That technology requires the target satellite to be
equipped with a magnetic docking plate from the get go and so could only
be used on satellites developed with debris removal in mind, like those
launched by internet megaconstellation operator OneWeb, which is
Astroscale\'s partner in the follow-up mission ELSA-M. But [[the new
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, developed for a U.K.-funded mission
called Cosmic (for Cleaning Outer Space Mission through Innovative
Capture), [[intends to take active space debris removal to another level
by targeting old satellites]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been tumbling
in space for decades and have no special features for a removal
spacecraft to attach to. \"The function of this mission is to remove two
pieces of U.K.-owned defunct debris satellites that are presently up
there,\" Jason Forshaw, Astroscale\'s head of future business, told
Space.com. \"There are some satellites which were launched in the 1990s
that have really come to the end of life, and a lot of those are kind of
in the region under 100 kilograms \[220 pounds\]. And so our aim is to
actually launch this mission to remove two of these failed satellites
that are at altitudes of roughly 500 to 800 kilometers \[310 to 490
miles\].\" The Cosmic debris removal spacecraft is likely going to face
many more challenges than ELSA-M, the collaboration with OneWeb. The
long-defunct satellites Cosmic will target may have partially
disintegrated in the harsh environment of space, with pieces falling off
that might make them difficult to grab. Long-dead spacecraft are also
likely to tumble as they hurtle through the vacuum of space at speeds of
over 15,000 mph (24,000 kph), making the capture even trickier.
\"Capturing a dead satellite that\'s been in space for 30 years is very,
very challenging,\" said Forshaw. \"We don\'t know the condition of the
satellite. Is it structurally intact? Have parts fallen off? Has it been
hit by debris? Space is a very harsh environment. So we don\'t know the
condition until we get there and we do an inspection to find out exactly
what it looks like. Does it look the same as it did when it was launched
30 years ago? I think those are some of the real challenges.\"
Astroscale thinks that it can tackle the challenge using the autonomous
navigation software tested by ELSA-d, and a cutting-edge robotic arm
currently developed by MDA, the same company that built the
International Space Station\'s robotic Canadarm2 in the 1990s. Forshaw
said the robotic arm would grab the old satellite by its launch adapter
ring, a circular structure used to mount the payload to the rocket.
[[The junk collector craft would then drag the debris into a very low
orbit, from where it would speedily enter Earth\'s atmosphere and burn
up]{.underline}]{.mark}. The debris removal spacecraft would then return
to collect a second object. The mission is currently in consideration
for funding from the U.K. Space Agency, which will decide between
Astroscale and a competing cleanup proposal by Switzerland-headquartered
CleanSpace. If selected, the mission would launch in 2026, about a year
after ELSA-M. Through ELSA-M, Astroscale hopes to further mature its
technologies, especially the autonomous approach and navigation system,
before attempting the more challenging old-junk capture. Space debris is
a growing problem. Some 34,260 debris objects --- including used rocket
stages, old satellites and fragments created in collisions --- are
currently tracked by space surveillance networks, according to the
European Space Agency (ESA). This number is bound to grow in the coming
years as more and more satellites are being launched, a trend driven by
the developers of satellite megaconstellations such as the one operated
by OneWeb and SpaceX\'s gigantic Starlink network. Scientists worry that
the amount of out-of-control objects hurtling around the planet could
lead to devastating, fragment-producing orbital collisions. Apart from
putting operational satellites at risk, these collisions could in the
longer term make the orbital environment around Earth too dangerous for
satellites to operate, as every orbital collision would generate so many
fragments that further collisions would ensue. This cascade of
collisions, known as the Kessler Syndrome, was first theorized by former
NASA scientist Donald Kessler in the late 1970s. Some scientists think
that the early stages of this disconcerting phenomenon may already be
underway. [**[Active debris removal is seen as a key technology to keep
space usable in the decades to come.]{.mark}** [Astroscale also has
plans to]{.mark}]{.underline} inspect and later [[remove a
discarded]{.mark}]{.underline} Japanese [[rocket
stage]{.underline}]{.mark} using a spacecraft built in cooperation with
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). That spacecraft, called
ADRAS-J, could embark on its space-cleaning mission in 2025, according
to Astroscale. ESA also plans to remove a spent rocket body from orbit
in 2025 using a junk collector spacecraft built by Astroscale\'s
competitor ClearSpace.

the [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s surface. [[This is the main way in
which space debris is removed]{.underline}]{.mark} from the near-Earth
space environment. Any long-term change in the density of the upper
atmosphere will therefore have a significant impact on the time
evolution of the space debris population. Also the meteoroid environment
influences the upper atmosphere. The atmospheric processing of Fe, Mg
and Si atoms ablated from micrometeoroids results in re-condensation of
meteoric material as nm-sized MSPs. These act as condensation nuclei of
noctilucent clouds (NLCs), which were reported for the first time in
1885 and have been since growing brighter and spreading to lower
latitudes. NLCs appear at the high latitude summer mesopause (around
\~85 km), where the temperature falls below 150 K and water vapour then
spontaneously forms ice particles. NLCs are a long-term indicator for
climate change due to the increase of H2O in the middle atmosphere
resulting from the oxidation of anthropogenic methane. The occurrence
frequency and brightness of NLCs may be impacted on decadal time scales
by changes in H2O and O3, and in the dominant meridional circulation in
the mesosphere. Temperature is crucial too, although there is no clear
evidence of a temperature decrease at the particular altitude of the
mesopause due to increased CO2

[Why ASATs have not been used]{.underline} The reasons why [the [space

political attack [is the reality that the [result would be a
graveyard]{.mark} in terms of sustaining any viable operational
presence]{.underline} in low Earth orbit and likely out to the orbital

[defeats the justification for the defensive use of ASAT

possession of the resulting open area, either in space, or on the
ground. Alternatively, you reject the use of nuclear weapons because of
the after-effects of EMP and radiation depending on the circumstances.
Instead, you employ [kinetic hit-to-kill (HTK) weapons]{.underline}. The

**[[few remedies exist]{.mark}]{.underline}** except establishing

#### Russia has already weaponized space, ensures their miscalc scenarios

and Russian officials, "US says Russia likely launched anti-satellite
weapon", <https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq55ww5j7e2o> JBlock

The US says [[Russia launched a satellite]{.underline}]{.mark} last week
which it believes may be capable of attacking other such probes.
\"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} we assess [[is likely a counter space
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat
Ryder on Tuesday evening. It was on the \"same orbit\" as a US
government satellite, he said, adding that Washington would continue to
monitor the situation and had to be ready to protect its interests.
Russia has not publicly commented on the issue. Moscow and Washington -
two global rivals - have repeatedly clashed over space weapons issue at
the UN in recent weeks, with both sides accusing each other of seeking
to militarise space. Earlier on Tuesday Russia\'s foreign ministry
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed the US was seeking to turn space
into an \"arena for military confrontation\". A number of military
experts have long warned that space is likely to be the next frontier of
warfare in an increasingly technology-dependent world. On Tuesday, Gen
Ryder said the Pentagon believed the Russian satellite was \"presumably
capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit\". \"Russia
deployed this new counter space weapon into the same orbit as a US
government satellite. \"And so assessments further indicate
characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads,
from 2019 and 2022. \"We have a responsibility to be ready to protect
and defend, the domain, the space domain, and ensure continuous and
uninterrupted support to the Joint and Combined Force,\" the Pentagon
spokesman added. Separately, a spokesperson for the US Space Command
told Reuters news agency that the satellite was \"likely a counter space
weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth
orbit\". The spokesperson said the satellite - Cosmos 2576 - was
launched on 16 May from Russia\'s Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 800km (497
miles) north of Moscow. In its statement,
[[Russia\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} Roskosmos state [[space agency said the
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} on 17 May **[[was \"in the interests of the
defence ministry]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Russian Federation\". It
said its launch vehicle Soyuz-2.1b was used. The different reported
launch dates might be explained by the fact that the Moscow time zone is
three hours ahead of GMT. Neither Moscow nor Washington provided any
further details. But space analysts say that Cosmos 2576 appears to be
on the same orbit as America\'s USA 314 satellite. Since launching a
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022[[, Russia has
warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that US [[satellites

The US Space Force needs a change in mindset and increased funding to
compete with China in the space domain, two retired US colonels argued
in a new report for the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. [[The
report]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was released earlier this week,
[[summarizes the findings and recommendations from
a]{.mark}]{.underline} two-day [[workshop]{.underline}]{.mark} held in
October at the Mitchell Institute\'s Spacepower Advantage Center of
Excellence. The event [[brought together 55 space
experts]{.underline}]{.mark} to examine the Space Force Chief of Space
Operations\' theory of success --- called \"Competitive Endurance\" ---
against a set of potential crises over the next 25 years, including the
Russian deployment of a nuclear antisatellite weapon and an attempted
Chinese space blockade. The workshop found that the role of the [[Space
Force]{.underline}]{.mark} was not well understood by many Americans and
that it [[lacked resources and a \"warfighting
ethos]{.underline}]{.mark},\" [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the authors
of the new report said [[threatened its long-term chances of success
against China]{.mark}]{.underline} in the space domain. \"Systemic
issues exist within the Space Force and Department of Defense that
threaten the success of the Space Force in a long-term competition with
China,\" Charles Galbreath, a retired US Space Force colonel, and
Jennifer Reeves, a retired US Air Force colonel, wrote. \"Chief among
these are: inadequate authorities and resources, a lack of clearly
defined and understood roles and missions, and the need for increased
warfighting ethos.\" Drawing on the workshop\'s findings, the authors,
both senior fellows at the Mitchell Institute, called on Congress to
increase funding to the USSF and loosen policy restrictions to allow the
deployment of offensive and defensive weapons, which they said would
enable the force to \"create a stronger posture, capable of deterring
hostile actions and conflict.\" They also urged the force to develop
educational and training programs that aimed to \"foster an assertive,
warfighting culture,\" adding that Space Force members --- known as
Guardians --- \"must see themselves as warfighters and project a
war-winning ethos.\" While Galbreath and Reeves praised the \"[[three
tenets of Competitive Endurance\" --- avoiding operational surprise,
denying first-mover advantage, and undertaking responsible counter-space
campaigning --- they said the theory did not \"normalize space as a
warfighting domain]{.underline}]{.mark}\" or allow Guardians to \"pursue
victory and space superiority,\" which they said made it difficult for
the public and Congress to grasp its military importance. \"[[If this
loophole is not addressed, the Space Force]{.underline}]{.mark} and U.S.
Space Command [[could find itself in a death spiral of waning support
and funding]{.underline}]{.mark}, ultimately [[precluding the fielding
of capabilities and conducting of operations necessary to secure U.S.
interests in space]{.underline}]{.mark},\" they added. A Space Force
spokesperson told Business Insider that \"[[as China and Russia
accelerate the development of counter-space capabilities, the need for a
well-resourced Space Force has **never been more
critical**.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[establishment of]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. [[Space
Force]{.underline}]{.mark} represent[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[a pivotal
moment]{.underline}]{.mark} in military history, [[underscoring the
growing significance of space in]{.underline}]{.mark} modern [[warfare
and national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. As technological
advancements continue to evolve, [[the ability to control and defend
space assets has become a **strategic imperative**]{.underline}]{.mark}
for nations worldwide. This article delves into the formation of the
Space Force, its strategic importance, key functions, technological
advancements, international relations, and India's perspective on space
militarization. The Formation of the Space Force The U.S. Space Force
was officially established on December 20, 2019, through the signing of
the National Defense Authorization Act by President Donald Trump. This
move was a culmination of several years of legislative and executive
efforts to address the increasing reliance on space for national
security and the need to protect U.S. interests in this domain. The
Space Force was created as a separate branch within the Department of
the Air Force, mirroring the relationship between the Marine Corps and
the Department of the Navy. The organizational structure of the Space
Force includes the Office of the Chief of Space Operations, various
field commands, and operational units dedicated to specific missions
such as satellite operations, space surveillance, and missile defense.
The leadership of the Space Force emphasizes the importance of
developing a specialized workforce skilled in space operations and
technology. In comparison, [[other]{.underline}]{.mark}
countrie[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[recognized the strategic importance of space]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[established their
own]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[space branches]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Russia's Aerospace Forces, formed in 2015, integrate air and space
defense capabilities. China's Strategic Support Force, established in
2015, consolidates space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities.
These developments [[highlight a global trend
towards]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[militarization of space, driven by
the need to maintain strategic advantages in an increasingly contested
domain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Strategic Importance of Space Space has
emerged as a critical domain for national security, with its importance
extending far beyond traditional military operations. Satellites play a
vital role in communication, navigation, surveillance, and intelligence
gathering. The Global Positioning System ([[GPS]{.underline}]{.mark}),
for example, [[is indispensable for]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[military
and civilian applications, enabling precise navigation and
timing]{.underline}]{.mark}. The strategic importance of space is
further underscored by [[its impact on conventional military
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Space-based assets provide
real-time intelligence and surveillance, enhancing situational awareness
and enabling precise targeting]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance,
during the Gulf War, satellite imagery and communications were crucial
for coalition forces, demonstrating the transformative impact of space
capabilities on modern warfare. However, the growing dependence on space
assets also introduces vulnerabilities. Anti-satellite ([[ASAT) weapons,
cyber-attacks,]{.underline}]{.mark} and space debris [[pose significant
threats to the integrity and functionality of
satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}. The ability to protect and defend space
assets is therefore paramount, necessitating the development of robust
space situational awareness and defensive capabilities. Key Functions
and Missions of the Space Force The primary mission of the U.S. Space
Force is to protect U.S. space assets and ensure the country's dominance
in space. This involves a range of functions and missions, including
space situational awareness, defensive and offensive space operations,
and support for terrestrial military operations. Space situational
awareness involves tracking and monitoring objects in orbit to prevent
collisions and detect potential threats. The Space Surveillance Network
(SSN) is a critical component of this mission, providing data on
thousands of objects in space. Advanced radar and optical systems are
used to maintain a comprehensive picture of the space environment.
Defensive space operations focus on protecting U.S. satellites and other
space assets from potential threats. This includes the development of
countermeasures against ASAT weapons and cyber-attacks. The Space Force
is also responsible for offensive space operations, which involve the
ability to disrupt or disable adversary space capabilities if necessary.
[[Supporting terrestrial military operations from space is another key
function of the Space Force. This includes providing satellite-based
communications, navigation, and intelligence to enhance the
effectiveness of ground, air, and naval forces]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) system provides high-capacity
communications for the U.S. military and its allies, ensuring reliable
connectivity in various operational environments.

### Arctic is Key

#### Arctic Conflict is inventible without Domain Awareness

**Auerswald 22**, David Auerswald is a nonresident senior fellow at the
Transatlantic Security Initiative in the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security. He is also professor of security
studies at the US National War College in Washington, DC. He has
published articles and chapters on a variety of national security and
foreign policy topics. His most recent work has focused on the
geopolitics of the Arctic (David Auerswald, 2022, "All security is
local: Arctic defense policies and domain awareness", Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/all-security-is-local-arctic-defense-policies-and-domain-awareness/)

The transatlantic community should be [[concerned about]{.mark} several
troubling [scenarios]{.mark} [that]{.mark} could [escalate into]{.mark}
armed [**conflict** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
first]{.mark} and most obvious [scenario]{.mark} [is]{.mark} of a
[**[Russia-NATO conflict]{.mark}** in the Baltic Sea or Black Sea
regions [spilling into the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russian]{.mark}
military [aggression against the Baltic]{.mark} states [or]{.mark}
against [NATO]{.mark} forces near Ukraine would involve or could
potentially involve elements of the Russian Northern Fleet, based in
Severomorsk, [which would [immediately]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} the
**conflict [into the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even]{.mark} if
Russian naval assets did not immediately attack, [[NATO]{.mark} forces
[would]{.mark} have to [act]{.mark} [as]{.mark} if [Northern
Fleet]{.mark} elements [were]{.mark} potentially [hostile]{.mark}
forces, [meaning]{.mark} that [NATO]{.mark} might [launch]{.mark}
precautionary [attacks]{.mark} against them following a Russian
incursion]{.underline}. In either instance, there would be significant
risk of horizontal escalation into the Arctic. Having a detailed picture
of Russian actions and movements would be crucial in this scenario.

[[A second scenario]{.mark} [involves]{.mark} a
**[misunderstanding]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **[accident]{.mark}** during
military exercises or training]{.underline}. [Russian]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} are famous for [launchi]{.mark}ng **[[mock
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} [Western
military]{.mark} assets and for operating without activating their
location transponders. [They have launched mock attacks against the
Vardo radar facility in Norway, Gotland Island in Sweden, Bornholm
Island in Denmark, and against NATO ships and aircraft in other
locales]{.underline}. [Any]{.mark} one of these [incidents]{.mark}
[could]{.mark} have **[[escalated out of control]{.underline}]{.mark}**
had Western forces reacted differently or had Russian forces attacked
without orders. [Having **[better domain awareness]{.mark}** would
[give]{.mark} [Western]{.mark} [forces]{.mark} better [warning]{.mark}
[of Russian military]{.mark} movements and insight as to whether
specific incidents were part of a **larger military
campaign**.]{.underline}

[A [third scenario]{.mark} involves a [dispute over]{.mark} mineral
[extraction]{.mark} [or]{.mark} commercial [fishing]{.mark} in Arctic
waters escalating out of control]{.underline}. [Russia and Norway
disagree]{.mark} [on]{.mark} whether Norway has sole [jurisdiction
over]{.mark} the [waters]{.mark} and seabed [around]{.mark} the
[Svalbard archipelago]{.mark}. [[Conflict]{.mark} could [arise]{.mark}
should [Russia]{.mark} [back up]{.mark} its [claims with
force]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Or]{.mark} consider that nine countries
plus the EU have agreed to a fishing moratorium for the central Arctic
ocean. Conflict could erupt should a large [state-authorized]{.mark}
[fishing]{.mark} operation be [caught harvesting in]{.mark} those
[waters]{.mark}. [Appropriate [**domain awareness**]{.mark} could
[give]{.mark} Western Arctic states [**warning** of]{.mark} initial
[violations and]{.mark} potentially [escalatory behavior in]{.mark}
either [maritime crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Each scenario points]{.mark} to [the need for **robust air**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} maritime **[domain awareness in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The most likely attack vectors are via
air or sea. Scenarios involving overland aggression are much less
plausible (though still of concern to the Finnish and Norwegian armies).
That begs the question of the degree to which Arctic states possess the
domain awareness capabilities needed to anticipate each scenario.

[warfighting scenarios]{.mark}. In responding to these challenges,
Arctic states have an opportunity to learn from, and leverage, lessons
from Ukraine on the role of technological development in contemporary
warfare.

The Ukrainian battlefield has illustrated the strengths and limitations
of several rapidly evolving technologies impacting the character of
warfare. While some technological solutions have provided robust
military advantages (e.g., the Starlink constellation) others have been
caught in action-reaction cycles where advantages have been quickly
neutralized by the adversary (e.g., certain configurations of drones or
precision-guided artillery).^3^ These lessons are already influencing
the strategies and force postures of Arctic states, including Russia.^4^

[[Any response to the]{.mark} changing [Arctic security]{.mark}
environment [requires]{.mark} addressing several key
concerns]{.underline}. The first is analyzing the vulnerabilities that
impede [the ability]{.mark} of Arctic states [to]{.mark} credibly and
capably both [deter]{.mark} [and fight [in the High
North]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At least]{.mark} partially due to the
absence of an independent command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability,
situational awareness is a vulnerability of particular
significance.^5^ Arctic states are instead dependent on vulnerable
undersea communications infrastructure, or space-based capabilities that
are relatively scarce and characterized by intra-alliance dependency on
the United States.^6^ Additionally, Europe's reliance on Norway as an
energy provider is vulnerable to Russian gray-zone tactics.^7^

The second concern is addressing these vulnerabilities, taking stock of
which technological capabilities will make a difference and how lessons
from the war in Ukraine can be efficiently applied to strategy and force
postures. [[The]{.mark} most [immediate priority to alleviate Arctic
security]{.mark} concerns [should be bolstering]{.mark} maritime
**[domain awareness in the region]{.mark}**, [which]{.mark} directly
[impacts]{.mark} European [energy security]{.mark} as well as [nuclear
security and deterrence]{.mark} by enhancing NATO's ability to detect,
monitor, and respond to potential threats]{.underline}. Ukraine has
demonstrated the utility and resiliency of advanced space capabilities
and unmanned systems when [used in]{.mark} nonpermissive environments.
[As **[Arctic geography]{.mark}** already creates dependency on
satellites]{.underline}, investing in space capabilities [should be a
main priority]{.mark}. Moreover, certain configurations of unmanned
systems can cost-efficiently bolster both situational awareness
[and]{.mark} offensive options in Arctic security.

**The Utility of [[Situational Awareness]{.underline} in the
Arctic]{.mark}**

Harnessing benefits from technological development [is]{.mark}
particularly [important]{.mark} [given]{.mark} the ongoing geopolitical
changes in the Arctic. Growing tension between NATO and Russia is likely
to lead to increased naval activity in the High North, where vulnerable
military, communications, and energy infrastructure is at risk of
sabotage and interference. While China is unlikely to establish a
significant presence in the Arctic, monitoring Chinese maritime traffic
and their potential activities in building C4ISR ground infrastructure
remains important.^8^ Monitoring Russian activity around its nuclear
deterrent posture has been of particular consequence since the beginning
of the war in Ukraine---in September 2024, [Russian president Vladimir
[Putin announced changes to]{.mark} Russia's **[nuclear
doctrine]{.mark}** [involving an "expansion"]{.mark} of its mission,
although any substantial differences are yet to be
revealed]{.underline}.^9^

[The White House]{.mark} has already identified C4ISR capabilities as
essential to its Arctic ambitions. Reflecting its "monitor-and-respond"
global posture as outlined [in]{.mark} its National Defense Strategy,
the United States asserts a general readiness to respond to threats in
the Arctic along with its regional allies, yet highlights two focal
points: the Arctic (1) houses various early-warning and intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and (2) acts as the
U.S. northern flank in carrying out Indo-Pacific operations.^10^ [In
[the strategy's implementation]{.mark} plan, the first strategic
objective [is]{.mark} improving the [understanding of the Arctic]{.mark}
operating [environment]{.mark}, [particularly emphasizing]{.mark} the
bolstering of space capabilities and maritime **[domain
awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^11^

[[The strategic utility]{.mark} [of]{.mark} an [Arctic presence
is]{.mark} considerable [**for early warning**]{.mark} purposes.
[Its]{.mark} geographical [location]{.mark} [makes the Arctic]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}n important [vantage point for]{.mark} **[monitoring]{.mark}
potential [ballistic missile launches]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} other
[airborne threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.^12^ Russia and the United
States---with its allies---depend on Arctic infrastructure for their
early warning systems, both through ground-based radars and ground
stations for satellite communications (SATCOM). Russia and China are
increasingly collaborating in developing defense technology, decidedly
prioritizing space and new technologies, and it is with [Russia's
cooperation that China is seeking to develop and deploy its own early
warning infrastructure.^13^]{.underline}

#### Arctic sensors are necessary for the golden dome.

Study of the Canadian North and a professor at the School for the Study
of Canada at Trent University. Andrea Charron is director of the Centre

published by the Wilson Center as 'The "Iron Dome" and implications for
the North.', The Golden Dome and implications for the North, The Watch,
6/28/25)

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order (EO) on January
27, 2025, directing the U.S. Department of Defense to build an "Iron
Dome for America," which is shorthand for a next-generation missile
defense shield for the United States (and since rebranded as the Golden
Dome). "Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from
next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex
with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of
next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air
and missile defense capabilities," the EO noted. Although skeptics have
questioned the cost and technological feasibility of a Golden Dome, the
need to defend North America against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced
cruise missiles and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer,
near-peer and rogue adversaries is now a U.S. priority.

Many will think of Israel's 10 Iron Dome batteries, which can cover
about 150 kilometers, to guard against missiles launched from relatively
short ranges. Israel also has other systems (David's Sling, Arrow System
and THAAD), which together form a system of systems to protect 9.4
million people and about 22,000 square kilometers of land. A [[Golden
Dome]{.mark}]{.underline} for the U.S. [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} be on
a scale, size and level of complexity to deal with the myriad missile
threats (and their trajectories, flight paths and delivery systems) that
will stretch the capabilities of engineers, scientists and the military.
[The system could [cover]{.mark} North America, including Canada, its
[Arctic]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [Alaska]{.mark}, protecting more than 380
million people and more than 19 million square kilometers.]{.underline}
However, for this current iteration of the EO, the Golden Dome will
likely concentrate on the United States; the EO is clear that it is the
Golden Dome for America. The technical necessity for comprehensive
space-based architecture and additional costs for systems to cover the
entire continent of North America is beyond the current defense
directive. The EO hints, however, at a role for allies and partners
noting, "Increase\[d\] bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile
defense technology development, capabilities, and operations" is
required. Canada and other allies will have important parts to play.

Retired U.S. Adm. James Stavridis, the former Supreme Allied Commander
of NATO, recently outlined the three elements of a successful Golden
Dome: space-based sensors and interceptors; artificial intelligence to
fuse and analyze information; and the ability to design, build and
implement a new method of destroying incoming missiles including with
lasers.

The clarion call to protect North America has been made by successive
commanders of the U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The goal of militaries is to have
all-domain awareness and defense of North America, informed by sensors
from seabed to outer space, that support deterrence by denial.
Deterrence by denial aims to change the calculus of adversaries by
permitting North America to see as far away as possible, in time and
space, to give the commander information dominance and decision
superiority. In other words, if North America can detect potential
threats earlier, governments have more options to respond, especially
options that do not involve force. Golden Dome could fundamentally
reshape how the U.S. thinks about defense and redefine integrated air
and missile defense systems. But answers about what to defend and from
what need to come first.

There are eye-watering costs, not to mention logistical and engineering
issues that will need to be tackled. Rather than one system to cover all
of North America, it is more likely to be many systems in many domains
to deal with different missile threats that protect the continental U.S.
at the early stages and expand from there with individual, likely
ground-based and aerial systems, for Canada and Alaska.

Missile defense and modernizing early warning systems in the North
American Arctic are complicated by the lack of persistent satellite
communications capabilities above 60 degrees latitude. Today's effective
missile defense systems are extremely information-intensive, and future
versions will be more so. One reason the F-35 is so hotly anticipated in
Canada is because it is a data and information vacuum, but managing such
information flows requires new communications capabilities. Technical
issues posed by the Arctic location include frequent low cloud cover,
aurora effects, maintaining a stable power supply, thermal management
for optics, ice formation, protecting sensitive optical components and
complex atmospheric turbulence, among many others. Adequate supply
chains and industry capacity are other challenges.

[[Strategically, the Arctic is a critical portion of the future Golden
Dome,]{.mark} [especially for cruise missiles, given the shortest avenue
of approach for many adversaries' delivery systems is over the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Analysts have wrestled with missile defense
for decades, including the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Strategic
Command, USNORTHCOM, NORAD, U.S. Space Force (and component commands),
and Defence Research Development, Canada's missile defense research
programs.

Canada, which contributes to and benefits from its longstanding
binational NORAD with the U.S., shares these concerns and has committed
to help address them through NORAD modernization programs, including
promises to enhance its military footprint in the northern approaches to
North America. NORAD warns of incoming missiles, but USNORTHCOM decides
which ones to defeat using its Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
System, which is oriented to defeat intercontinental ballistic missiles
from North Korea or Iran but is unable to manage the large and more
sophisticated Russian and Chinese missiles. [[NORAD's North Warning
System]{.mark}, a series of short- and long-range radars, [and future
Arctic and Polar Over the Horizon Radar systems will be essential
sources of information. The latter two will be able to see far beyond
North America and into the Arctic and the Greenland-Iceland-United
Kingdom gap.]{.mark}]{.underline} A firm commitment to contribute to the
Golden Dome is an important shift in policy for Canada.

The deadlines the EO sets for initial concepts are tight, and
off-the-shelf options likely will be preferred. NORAD will continue to
defend all of North America with its three missions: aerospace warning
and control and maritime warning.

There is great opportunity for Canada to rethink its defense posture and
the sensors hosted by it and its space-based assets (such as Sapphire).
It could catalyze deeper bilateral cooperation in continental defense,
pushing both countries to develop new capabilities tailored to
high-latitude operations. The U.S.is defended with the help of allies
and is the basis of Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous pledge in 1938
delivered in Kingston, Ontario, that the American people will "not stand
idly by." Canada must be ready to do its part.

#### The arctic region is critical for missile defense

Over the past five years, [[Russia has moved aggressively to build its
Arctic military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, apparently [[in an
effort to secure its claims and interests in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 Increasingly, [[human activity is
occurring in the Arctic as the sea ice recedes and economic opportunity
opens to nations via new shipping lanes.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Characteristically, [[in any geographical area, with the rise in human
activity there is also the corresponding possibility that friction will
occur as people compete to exploit the natural resources and
corresponding economic possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such
friction---and [[potential conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in the
Arctic is highly likely at some point unless preparations are made to
mitigate it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Alaska makes the United States an
Arctic nation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and its location places the state
and country at the center of this fast-evolving region.2 Thus, [[Alaska
is critical to the national security of the United States; however, we
are not, as a nation, keeping pace with the rapidly changing security
situation in the Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark} Lagging here could also
have an enormous impact on our economy. To change this dynamic, there
are several things that the U.S. military can do to ensure the future
security of the region

safeguarded.]{.mark}]{.underline} It builds upon guidance laid out in
the 2022 National Security Strategy and 2022 National Defense Strategy
and is part of DODs effort to implement the 2022 National Strategy for
the Arctic Region. \"This strategy is very action oriented, which
distinguishes it from previous Arctic Strategies\" Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Arctic & Global Resilience Iris Ferguson said. \"We unpack
where we need to sustain our investments, especially in critical
capabilities. What do we have to see? How do we communicate? Do we have
the right equipment to operate in the region? My office exists to
champion these capabilities, which are vital to the successful
implementation of our strategy.\" [[The Arctic region is undergoing
rapid change, both strategically and physically.]{.mark} [The People\'s
Republic of China (PRC), which remains DOD\'s pacing challenge, seeks
increasing access and influence in the Arctic, while Russia remains an
acute threat in the region despite its losses in Ukraine. Increasingly,
these two competitors are collaborating in the Arctic with implications
for the security of the United States and our Allies and
partners.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the same time, Finland and Sweden\'s
historic decision to join NATO brings all like-minded Arctic states into
the NATO Alliance and presents new opportunities for collaboration and
cooperation. All of this is underscored by the impact of climate change
on the Arctic, which is warming at least three times faster than the
rest of the world and increasingly opening to more human activity.

### Satellites turn

#### Satellites go NUCLEAR through ASATs

[[China and Russia]{.mark} have been [monitor]{.mark}ing [U.S. efforts
to protect]{.mark} its [space assets]{.mark} [and]{.mark} are trying to
[devise]{.mark} [ways to counter them]{.mark}, to [include]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} potential [large-scale attack]{.mark}, the Space Force's No.
2 officer said Aug. 28]{.underline}. The Space Force and the Department
of Defense have turned to proliferated constellations to make the U.S.
satellites less vulnerable to attack and say the U.S. remains ahead in
space. "Proliferation means I'm now spreading out orbitology across
multiple different orbits, so that they can't just take out one
satellite; they have to take out a bunch of satellites," Vice Chief of
Space Operations Gen. Michael A. Guetlein said at the AFCEA/INSA
Intelligence and National Security Summit. "Then through proliferation,
we're partnering with other entities to get just more assets on orbit.
That is a significant investment for the United States Space Force."
[But w[hen asked if]{.mark} even disaggregated [satellites]{.mark} would
be [at risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a ["large-scale" attack]{.mark},
[Guetlein]{.mark} [did not hesitate. "Yes, I do," he said.]{.mark} "How
is to be determined, what the impact of it is to be determined,"
Guetlein said, referring to such an attack. "But they are watching
what's going on in places like Ukraine and Gaza, and they are
understanding how the world has become dependent upon
space]{.underline}. They're understanding the impact of those
disaggregated architectures, and they are actively working on how to
counter that capability." Russia has apparently not only been monitoring
U.S. assets in space but has also been keeping close tabs on American
space officials. On Aug. 28, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a
statement announcing it has permanently banned Guetlein, along with 91
other individuals, from visiting Russia because of the "Biden
administration's Russophobic policy." Other people banned included Gen.
Stephen N. Whiting, the head of U.S. Space Command; Lt. Gen. Philip A.
Garrant, the head of Space Systems Command; and former Pentagon space
policy chief John Plumb. [[U.S. officials]{.mark} have [said]{.mark}
that [Russia]{.mark} is **[developing a nuclear-armed anti-satellite
weapon]{.mark},** among other capabilities.]{.underline} While the Space
Force is facing increasing threats, it is also dealing a flat budget of
\$30 billion---a slight decrease when accounting for inflation. "That
may sound like a lot, but that's a drop in the bucket," Guetlein said.
"That's an enormous amount of heavy lift the nation is getting for three
and a half percent of the DOD budget." The Space Force's No. 2 officer
said the budgetary constraints are preventing the service from
addressing "some of the additional mission areas that we think we need
to get after." When it comes to countering future Chinese or Russian
threats, Gutlein said he was hopeful the soon-to-be-established Space
Futures Command would help the Space Force field a more resilient force.
"What we're hoping comes out of Space Futures Command is what we call
the 'objective architecture,'" Guetlein said. "That's the architecture
that we want tomorrow to look like. What that does for you is it defines
your risk, because the difference between your objective architecture
and your fielded architecture is the risk that you're accepting today,
and the difference between your objective architecture and the
architecture that you have funded is the risk that you're accepting in
your current budget. So that really now starts to define where can we go
as a Space Force."

interceptors would escalate tensions with Russia and China. One reason
is because the interceptors could be designed to attack other satellites
that serve vital military and economic roles. The interceptors could
target not only all low-Earth-orbiting satellites, but also satellites
at higher orbits where GPS and communications satellites operate.

By the time SpaceX got off the ground, [[decades of space exploration
had already left a legacy of debris circling Earth. Scientists warn that
if the steadily growing problem is left unchecked]{.underline}]{.mark}
for too long, [[we could face even greater issues]{.underline}]{.mark}
than satellite reflections blinding our telescopes; we may even be
trapping ourselves beneath a dangerous orbital veil of our own making.
In 1978, space debris expert Don Kessler proposed the idea of a domino
effect of collisions in low Earth orbit---where a growing number of
spacecraft leads to increased collisions and thereby growing quantities
of orbital debris that, in turn, would lead to more collisions. Hence
known today as the "Kessler Syndrome," the idea remained largely
theoretical for many decades. However, with thousands of satellites now
occupying Earth's orbit, accompanied by close to 36,500 pieces of debris
greater than four inches in diameter, and potentially hundreds of
millions of vastly smaller fragments, [[experts have increasingly voiced
concerns in recent years about]{.underline}]{.mark} the real possibility
of such [[a large-scale calamity]{.underline}]{.mark} in space. The
European Space Agency (ESA) calls the task an "urgent one," citing
debris levels that "have increased 50% in the last five years in low
orbit." If a chaotic orbital traffic jam of this magnitude were to
occur, [[even one of the smallest shards of space
debris,]{.underline}]{.mark} which can reach speeds of close to 17,000
miles per hour as they are propelled through orbit, [[would be capable
of punching through spacecraft hulls.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[**[Kessler]{.mark}**'s Syndrome [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a global
phenomenon characterized by [the presence of tens of [**millions** of
**debris**]{.mark} pieces]{.underline} of various sizes [[that disrupt

operation**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This article delves into the
potential outcomes of a Kessler's Syndrome occurrence and its

satellite communications [could gradually or **rapidly** affect global
affairs]{.underline}. As humans are a dominant force on Earth, their
[endangerment would **reverberate** throughout the ecological

recognize these implications and work [towards]{.underline} safeguarding
satellite communication to mitigate potential [**negative** outcomes for
**humanity**]{.underline}'s wellbeing and progress. The recycling of
space debris emerges as a promising and long-term sustainable solution
to the mitigation of space debris. By repurposing decommissioned
satellites and debris into useful materials to support other space
missions, this recycling strategy presents a win-win scenario, promoting
environmental sustainability and resource efficiency in space
exploration.

1 Introduction

Space has emerged as a key domain since the historic launch of Sputnik
1, the first man-made satellite, in 1957 Dickson (2011). Since then,
there has been an exponential proliferation of artificial objects in
space Anz-Meador (2020) and Bastida Virgili et al. (2016). These
satellites serve diverse purposes, from military and commercial
applications to navigation and communication systems. Satellite
communication has revolutionized global connectivity, becoming
indispensable in the modern world. With more than 8,000 active and
defunct satellites orbiting Earth Cowardin (2022), satellite systems
have become integral to the daily lives of individuals, businesses, and
organizations around the world. The significance of satellite
communication is evident from the fact that, as of April 2022, there
were 5.03 billion internet users, representing 63.1% of the world's
population, highlighting the massive dependence on satellite
communication for various activities Petrosyan, (2023).

However, [this **escalating** presence of satellites]{.underline} in
space has [led to a growing concern: space **debris**]{.underline}. In
particular, the collision of the Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellites
in 2009 generated a cloud of debris that continues to pose a threat to
other satellites Oleksyn (2009) and Garcia (2021). Additionally, India's
antisatellite missile test in 2019 resulted in approximately 400 pieces
of orbital debris, increasing the risk to the International Space
Station (ISS) Molayath and Sanal Kumar (2010) and Mariappan et al.
(Mariappan et al., 2019; Mariappan et al., 2020). Low Earth and
geostationary (GEO) orbits, where many operational satellites are
located, have become cluttered with space debris, some traveling at
hypervelocity speeds of 7 km/s to 15 km/s Sample (2016). Even minuscule
debris particles possess significant kinetic energy, posing threats to
satellites and spacecraft. The risk of collision-induced chain
reactions, as theorized by Donald J. Kessler in 1978, has gained
traction and is now known as "Kessler's Syndrome" Kessler and
Cour-Palais (1978). [This syndrome predicts]{.underline} an [escalating
space [debris]{.mark}]{.underline} population [that [leads to]{.mark} an
**[increased]{.mark}** likelihood of [**collisions**]{.mark} and
further]{.underline} debris [creation, resulting in a
**cascade**]{.underline} of detrimental impacts. Such
[collisions]{.underline}, even minor ones, can [set off]{.underline} a
[catastrophic [**chain reaction**, jeopardizing]{.mark} all existing
[satellites]{.mark} and filling orbits [with **high-velocity**
debris]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accessing space orbits would become
immensely challenging, and the prospect of exploring outer space might
be compromised. Computer-generated future scenarios indicate that the
space debris population may reach saturation and collisions will persist
even without new spacecraft launches Liou and Johnson (2006) and
National Research Council (2011).

This article delves into the potential outcomes of the occurrence of
Kessler's Syndrome. While space exploration has propelled humanity's
understanding of the cosmos, it is essential to recognize and address
the potential threats posed by space debris. Collaborative efforts,
innovative mitigation techniques, and proactive measures are essential
to safeguard the future of satellite communication and space
exploration. The responsibility falls on all nations to work together,
akin to global agreements addressing environmental issues, to protect
our collective interests and ensure the long-term sustainability of
space activities. As we navigate the complexities of space, it is vital
to preserve the integrity of our endeavors and protect against the
[**adverse** impacts]{.underline} of space debris [on humanity's
**future**]{.underline}.

2 Impact on major sectors without satellites

In the contemporary era, the accessibility of an array of conveniences
within arm's reach has become a hallmark of modern civilization,
primarily enabled by the vast network of thousands of Earth-orbiting
satellites facilitating real-time data collection and transmission.
However, it is imperative to consider the potential consequences should
we encounter a sudden loss of control or communication with all
satellite systems within a compressed time frame Hollingham (2013). In
this article, "satellite communication" pertains to the retrieval of
satellite data from ground stations in the event of satellite damage,
whether partial or complete. This section delves into the prospective
ramifications of Kessler's Syndrome, envisioning a scenario where
satellite communication is entirely compromised over the span of two to
three decades, and explores its profound implications on humans. The
authors highlight the increasing risk of collisions between active space
vehicles and space debris, an effect attributed to the increase in the
affordability of satellite launches and the commercialization of the
space industry Tao et al. (2022). Understanding the gravity of such a
prospect is vital for informed decision-making and robust contingency
planning.

2.1 Space industry

The present investigation examines the potential threats posed by
Kessler's Syndrome to the space industry and its implications on
satellite operations and access to space. Current data suggest that, at
this point, the probability of an abrupt occurrence of this syndrome
over a short period remains relatively low Kessler (2009). It is
estimated that destructive collisions below 1,000 km altitude occur
approximately every 3.9 years over the span of 1,000 years, considering
certain assumptions such as debris size being greater than or equal to
10 cm, controlled launch rates, and absence of explosions Lewis (2020).
The amount of space debris in orbit by size is shown in Table 1.
However, it is essential to recognize that unforeseen factors, such as
the launch of additional satellites in the coming years, anti-satellite
missile tests, and satellite collisions, could escalate these risks.
Even tiny debris measuring 1 mm, carrying an energy equivalent to 71 J
or 0.0003 TNT/kg, could trigger catastrophic collisions and generate
more fragments The Aerospace Corporation (2023). A collision with a 10
cm single of debris, possessing high kinetic energy, can further
exacerbate the situation. Additionally, the presence of tens of millions
of tiny debris pieces, below or equal to 1 cm in size, presents tracking
challenges, hindering the efficacy of current mitigation techniques that
involve maneuvering spacecraft to avoid potential impacts.

The lack of an active removal system in space could lead [to an
**exponential** increase in objects in]{.underline} low-Earth orbit
(**[[LEO]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[impeding]{.mark} spacecraft
**[launches]{.mark}** and maneuvering]{.underline}. Consequently, loss
of control within LEO or significant communication disruptions with
satellites could [severely [**limit** access to **space**]{.mark} for
future missions]{.underline}. Furthermore, with the appearance of
Kessler's Syndrome, the launch of satellites would be a higher risk, as
the orbits could be densely populated with debris clouds exhibiting
varying kinetic energies The Aerospace Corporation (2023).
[Such]{.underline} an eventuality [may [necessitate]{.mark}]{.underline}
a [[**shutdown** of]{.mark} global [space programs]{.mark}]{.underline}
until viable solutions are devised, potentially leading to economic
imbalances and job losses within the space industry. The ensuing section
delves into the cascading effects on other industries resulting from
space program limitations due to the inaccessibility of space.

2.2 Impact of GNSS disruption on various industries

The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a critical
satellite-based navigation system that provides essential guidance to
humans and vehicles navigating various terrains. Its uses are
widespread, with essential industries such as defense, aviation, space
exploration, maritime, rail transportation, and road networks benefiting
from it Pistoia (2009) and The Aerospace Corporation (2021). GNSS
satellites operate primarily in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), at altitudes
ranging from 2,000 km to 31,570 km above the Earth's surface. MEO, which
is located between GEO and LEO, has the advantage of having a lower
population of space junk than its counterparts, LEO and GEO European
Space Agency (ESA) (2023). Because of the increasing worldwide
competitiveness in space activities, the LEO, an ever-increasing
concentration of space objects, is attained the saturation. The increase
in debris in LEO poses a serious threat to current and future space
operations, compromising our ability to launch and maintain spacecraft
in this important region Colvin et al. (2023). If LEO becomes
overcrowded with orbital debris and effective mitigation techniques
remain undeveloped, the chances of putting a spacecraft into orbit will
diminish dramatically. It is important to think on long-term scales,
which would take LEO problems to other orbits, such as MEO and GEO.
Thus, looking at the effect of GPS operations in MEO orbits is crucial
for future debris mitigation. Figure 1 shows the number of trackable
objects in each orbital domain.

This section explores the potential consequences of a GNSS disruption on
many sectors, particularly if our ability to launch new satellites into
orbit is jeopardized. It is critical to fully appreciate the
implications in order to identify vulnerabilities and build contingency
plans to reduce the impact of GNSS unavailability across these varied
businesses. At the moment, Earth's orbit is home to a constellation of
31 active Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) United States Space Force
(2022a), 35 active BeiDou satellites, 24+ Galileo satellites, 24+
GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema, or Global
Navigation Satellite System), 7 Indian Regional Navigation Satellite
System (IRNSS)/Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC), and 7
Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) United States Space Force (2021d).

2.2.1 Impact on [the **[defense]{.mark}** sector]{.underline}

The defense sector [is heavily [**dependent** on]{.mark}]{.underline}
satellite communication (**[[SATCOM]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[for]{.mark} critical military operations, including
[**communication**, **missile** guidance]{.mark}]{.underline}, search
and rescue missions, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [piloting
of]{.underline} unmanned aerial vehicles
(**[[UAVs]{.underline}]{.mark}**), among other essential functions
United States Space Force (United States Space Force, 2021b; United
States Space Force, 2022a). Loss of satellite communication systems
would significantly impede the sector's ability to operate at full
capacity. Without reliable communication systems, transmitting messages
would become difficult for military personnel. Although an analog system
serves as a **[backup]{.underline}** mode of [communication]{.underline}
United States Space Force (2019), its limited operational range [poses
**challenges**]{.underline} for effective communication. [Relying solely
on analog systems]{.underline} for extensive military operations [would
prove impractical.]{.underline} Currently, the defense sector worldwide
exhibits an average reliance of 70%--80% on satellite communication, and
this figure is expected to increase in the future, although the exact
percentage remains classified for security reasons Weeden and Samson
(2018).

2.2.2 Airline industry

[The [**airline** industry relies]{.mark}]{.underline} extensively
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Flight Management System]{.underline}
(FMS) to automate various in-flight operations that were previously
performed manually, thus facilitating smoother flight operations Spitzer
(2018). [**[FMS]{.mark}** uses]{.underline} multiple sensors, including
[**GPS**, to calculate the position of the aircraft and fuel
levels]{.underline}, among other critical parameters Stössel (2015). A
breakdown in the satellite communication system would disrupt the
transmission of GPS data, potentially compromising the FMS
functionality. Although modern aircrafts are equipped with backup
sensors to facilitate landing in case of technical failures Stössel
(2015), relying solely on analog communication for flight operations
midst the multitude of flights poses significant risks. In such an
event, communication between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and flights could
be severely hampered, affecting effective flight management and response
to emergencies European Space Agency (2022) and Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) (2022).

Without access to satellite communication systems, pilots and ATC would
not be able to receive real-time weather updates, leading to potential
risks of navigate under hazardous weather conditions Norton and Omberg
(1947). Given the projected future increase in global air passenger
traffic Statista Research Department (2022a), the implications of
disrupted satellite communication in the airline industry could be
far-reaching. [The industry plays a **[vital]{.mark}** role
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} various sectors, including [medical tourism,
**[vaccine distribution]{.mark}**, and air cargo]{.underline} delivery
International Air Transport Association (2022) and Dalen and Alpert
(2019). [A loss of]{.underline} effective [satellite]{.underline}
communication could [hinder]{.underline} the seamless [functioning
of]{.underline} these [critical services,]{.underline} potentially
jeopardizing lives and putting off urgent medical care.

In addition, [the **airline** industry [maintains]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[considerable **[workforce]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with nearly 87.7
million people employed directly and indirectly Salas (2022a). In the
event of reduced or [unavailable satellite communication]{.underline},
the industry may face temporary or permanent downsizing, [leading
to]{.underline} job losses and **[economic instability]{.underline}**
for numerous individuals and families.

2.2.3 Marine industry

[Modern [**ships** rely]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark}]{.underline}
sophisticated systems, such as Automatic Identification Systems (AIS)
and **[[GNSS]{.underline}]{.mark}**, among others, to ensure safe
navigation and collision avoidance during their voyages Tetreault (2005)
and Coast Guard---Office of Navigation Systems and Code of Federal
Regulations (2019). Satellite communication systems play a crucial role
in facilitating seamless communication and weather monitoring, helping
ships reach their destinations safely. In the event of satellite
communication failure, ships would be forced to resort to radar and
analog communication systems. However, the maximum range of a ship radar
for object detection is limited to 200 nautical miles Jenn (2019).
Without proper communication with the Vessel Traffic Services, ships can
be forced to suspend shipping operations until a viable communication
solution is established or resort to navigating through analog means.

As [ocean shipping serves]{.underline} as [the **[primary]{.mark}** mode
of transport [for global **trade**]{.mark}]{.underline} Placek (2022),
[disruptions in **satellite** communication would have **far-reaching**
effects]{.underline} on various industries relying on shipping services.
The shipping industry provides essential logistical support for numerous
sectors, and any disruption could lead to supply chain disruptions and
economic repercussions. According to estimates for 2011, the global
marine fishery industry employs more than 260 million people Teh and
Sumaila (2011). The potential reduction in shipping operations due to
communication system failures would put these jobs at risk, leading to
economic challenges for the workforce and affecting local communities
dependent on the maritime sector.

2.2.4 Railway industry The global railway network, which comprises an
extensive route length of more than 1.3 million kilometers, is heavily
dependent on GNSS technology for numerous indispensable functions Salas
(2022b). Modern railway systems around the world are equipped with
GNSS-based Positive Train Control systems, which play a critical role in
preventing train collisions and ensuring safe operations United States
Space Force (2021a). GNSS serves as a crucial tool for tracking
locomotives, rail cars and wayside equipment, facilitating the
synchronization of communication systems and enabling seamless
communication among locomotive engineers, dispatchers, trains, airports,
rail stations, and ports. Passengers also benefit from accurate train
location information, allowing them to predict arrival times with
precision. Given the paramount importance of GNSS for navigation and
signaling, the uninterrupted operation of current rails depends on this
indispensable technology. A potential reduction in GNSS availability
could lead to the curtailment of railway operations, affecting millions
of passengers who rely heavily on train commutes for transportation
Hughes (2020). By 2022, the rail freight industry in the United States
provided employment to approximately 135,000 individuals Statista
Research Department (2022c). Similarly, Indian railways employ an
estimated 1.54 million individuals, while the Chinese railway industry
boasts nearly 2 million employees The Economic Times (ET) (2017) and
Statista Research Department (2021b). These statistics underscore the
significant contribution of the railway sector to the economy on a
global scale, and any potential minimization of the railways due to GNSS
disruptions would jeopardize these jobs. In addition, the railway
industry plays a crucial role in transporting cargo to various
locations. In the United States, rail freight volumes reached 2.53
trillion tonnes kilometer in 2018, but the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic saw this figure decrease to 2.1 trillion tonnes kilometer by
2020 Statista Research Department (2022b). In India, Indian Railways
transported more than 1.42 billion metric tons of freight in fiscal year
2022 Sun (2023). In China, the rail industry transported an impressive
4.77 billion tons of rail cargo in 2021 Statista Research Department
(2023c). 2.2.5 RoadwaysIn 2015, global road freight activity reached
approximately 19,000 billion tonne-kilometers, and projections indicate
that this figure will more than double by 2050. It is expected that the
volume of road freight will increase by 91% in 2050 compared to 2020
Statista Research Department (2021c). However, the efficient functioning
of road transport is highly dependent on GNSS technology. GNSS plays an
essential role in improving vehicle efficiency and safety on roads,
streets and mass transit networks by mitigating routing and dispatch
challenges for commercial vehicles, as well as for mass transit, road
maintenance, and emergency vehicles United States Space Force (2021e).
The global installed base of Global Navigation Satellite System devices
was 6.5 billion units in 2021, with forecasts predicting an increase to
10.6 billion devices by 2031 Alsop (2022). In addition, numerous nations
use GNSS to inspect highway and road networks, enabling the detection of
various features such as service stations, emergency services, entry and
exit ramps, and road damage. The data collected feed into Geographic
Information Systems, contributing to reduced maintenance and repair
expenses and improved driver safety. GNSS technology also facilitates
the automation of traffic lights Munoz-Organero et al. (2018).Taking
into account the immense scale of road travel, statistics indicate that
Americans engage in 1.1 billion travel activities daily, each person
taking approximately four trips within the country Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (2017). Additionally, an average of 236
billion vehicles travel on the road in the United States every month
Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2022). With such high vehicle
traffic, GNSS monitoring is crucial for accident prevention, especially
as we move towards automated driving. The absence of GNSS would present
significant challenges to vehicle monitoring and navigation in a world
increasingly dependent on transportation systems. This disruption would
profoundly affect various industries, as nearly every sector depends on
efficient transportation systems to take care of the commute of workers
and deliver products to customers.2.2.6 GNSS timing

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

[GNSS plays a **[critical]{.mark}** role [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
providing [accurate **determination**]{.underline} of time, longitude,
latitude and altitude, [making it]{.underline} a [crucial]{.underline}
fourth dimension [for various industries and **[economic]{.mark}**
activitie**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} United States Space Force (2022b).
GNSS satellites are equipped with highly precise atomic clocks, enabling
the dissemination of real-time GNSS signals with exceptional accuracy.
Access to time within 100 billionths of a second eliminates the need for
costly investments in maintaining atomic clocks, benefiting industries
that heavily rely on precise timing.

[Numerous sectors, such as]{.underline} electrical power [[**grids**,
**financ**]{.mark}ial networks]{.underline}, and communication systems,
[[depend on]{.mark} precise **[timing]{.mark}**]{.underline} to achieve
synchronization and operational efficiency. GNSS time enables companies
to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve capabilities. In
wireless telephone and data networks, perfectly synchronized base
stations improve spectrum usage and improve mobile phone performance.
Digital radio broadcasting services also take advantage of GNSS time to
ensure simultaneous bit transmission from all radio stations, minimizing
listener delays during station switching.

The financial sector benefits from GNSS time for accurate time-stamping
of transactions, ensuring precise record-keeping and traceability.
Furthermore, integration of GNSS time into seismic monitoring networks
enables rapid pinpointing of epicenters of earthquakes and other seismic
phenomena.

The utility and power industries have specific time and frequency
requirements to ensure reliable power transmission and distribution.
GNSS time plays a crucial role in meeting these demands United States
Space Force (2022b). However, the potential risks to satellite
communication systems pose threats to the global economy, potentially
leading to crashes and minimized or disrupted functions in essential
utility services, as these sectors heavily rely on GNSS timing. Such
economic downturns could result in widespread job losses that affect
billions of people worldwide. Further discussions on the implications of
losing GNSS time in the energy and utility sectors are presented later
in this article.

As technology continues to advance rapidly, the reliance on GNSS timing
is expected to grow significantly in the future. Therefore, protecting
and fortifying the GNSS infrastructure becomes imperative to support
global economic stability and ensure the continued operation of
essential utility services.

2.2.7 **[Agriculture]{.underline}**

From 1990 to 2012, agricultural activities occupied a significant
proportion of the global land area, accounting for 35.79% in 2011
Statista Research Department (2015). The [implementation]{.underline} of
precision agriculture has revolutionized agricultural practices through
the utilization of GNSS-based applications United States Space Force
(2021c). Precision agriculture encompasses a diverse range of tasks,
including farm planning, tractor guidance, variable rate applications,
and yield mapping, among others. The [**integration** of GNSS technology
has proven [**invaluable** to farm]{.mark}ers]{.underline}, allowing
seamless operations even in challenging conditions such as poor
visibility caused by rain, dust, fog or darkness.

[Precision agriculture]{.underline}, powered by GNSS,
[facilitates]{.underline} the [**application** and distribution of
precise]{.underline} pesticides, [**herbicides**, and **fertilizers**,
leading to]{.underline} cost reduction, increased production, and
[enhanced [ecological **sustainability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Manufacturers of GNSS equipment have developed various tools to improve
productivity and efficiency in precision agricultural practices. Farmers
worldwide use GNSS services to optimize their operations Katz and Murphy
(1997), and weather forecasts, accessible through satellite
communication systems Ritchie (2021), play an essential role in guiding
their farming decisions.

[The]{.underline} minimization or [loss of **satellite**]{.underline}
communication system**[s]{.underline}** would [profoundly impact
agriculture, [directly affect]{.mark}ing [**food**
production]{.mark}]{.underline}. The indispensable role of GNSS in
modern farming practices makes it challenging for farmers to revert to
traditional methods without its support. Ensuring the continued
operation of satellite communication systems is crucial for maintaining
efficient and sustainable agricultural practices and securing global
food production. Further discussions on the implications of losing
satellite communication on the agricultural sector are presented in
subsequent sections of this article.

2.3 Energy and utility sector

[The **[energy]{.mark}** and utility sector]{.underline} plays a vital
role in society and [is highly [**dependent** on GNSS]{.mark} time
[to]{.mark} efficiently [**distribute** and **transmit**
power]{.mark}]{.underline} United States Space Force (2022b). However,
the sector faces significant risks when satellite communication systems
are reduced or completely lost. Additionally, the energy and utility
sector's operations depend on various interlinked services, including
banking for financial transactions, the transportation sector for the
delivery of essential goods and the distribution of utilities such as
gas.

The global usage of electricity is substantial, with nearly 7 billion
out of 7.67 billion people worldwide using electricity daily Ritchie
(2021). In 2019, global electricity consumption reached approximately
23,900 TWh Statista Research Department (2022d). The availability of
electricity is crucial for individuals, communities, and organizations
alike, and any disruption would significantly impact their functioning.

House and Senate (2015), it was stated that the absence of electricity
could potentially lead to a 90% mortality rate among Americans. This
assertion may hold true not only for Americans but for a significant
portion of the global population, given the [**indispensable**
role]{.underline} that [electricity plays in]{.underline} everyday
[**survival** for people worldwide]{.underline}.

The energy sector relies on various sources, such as renewable energy,
nuclear reactors, coal, natural gas, and liquid fuels, for electricity
generation Statista Research Department (2021a). Figure 2 displays the
distribution of energy sources used to generate electricity. However,
this sector is highly dependent on the transportation sector to ensure
the supply of resources and the distribution of electricity. In the
absence of proper transportation functioning, sectors depending on
energy and utility, including banking and hospitality, would stop
working or face significant limitations. As satellite communication
systems contribute substantially to the efficiency and reliability of
the energy and utility sector, any potential loss of this technology
could have far-reaching consequences. Further discussions on the
implications of the loss of satellite communication systems on the
energy and utility sector and associated industries will be discussed in
later sections of this article. The protection of satellite
communication stability is imperative to ensure uninterrupted energy and
utility services and the smooth functioning of numerous interconnected
sectors in the modern world. 2.3.1 Renewable energy Renewable energy
plays a significant role in global electricity generation, contributing
approximately 6.99 TW-hours Statista Research Department (2021a). Among
various renewable energy sources, biomass, hydroelectric, geothermal,
wind, and solar energy are the main contributors United States Energy
Information Administration (U.S. Energy Information Administration,
2023b and U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). Hydropower is
based on the water cycle, and electricity is generated through dams
utilizing elevation differences. During major power outages, many
countries depend heavily on this energy source. Large dams employ
numerous sensors, which rely on satellite communication, for crucial
tasks such as opening and closing gates, dam assessment, power
generation and monitoring Coombs and Braithwaite (2021). Although manual
gate operation is possible, efficiently controlling the water allowance
without an effective satellite communication system may prove
challenging. Geothermal energy Heasler et al. (2009) requires precise
location mapping, a task facilitated by GNSS technology. Satellite
communication enables complete monitoring of entire geothermal plants
with fewer human resources, ensuring timely reporting of any failures
Morgan (2020). The development and management of solar and wind farms
also benefit from satellite technology. Consequently, the dependence on
satellite communication becomes crucial for the efficient operation of
these renewable energy facilities. Countries that rely on other nations
for resources to generate electricity, such as biomass and fuel, may
face significant challenges, as importation of goods would be hindered
without a properly functioning transportation sector. The interconnected
nature of the generation and distribution of renewable energy
underscores the importance of preserving satellite communication systems
to ensure a stable and sustainable global energy landscape. 2.3.2 Coal
Coal is the dominant resource for electricity generation, with
approximately 35.8% of global coal usage dedicated to energy production
Statista Research Department (2023d). In 2022, worldwide coal power
generation reached approximately 10,191 TWh Statista Research Department
(2023a). The coal industry is highly dependent on satellite technology,
covering various stages from mining Xie et al. (2018) to coal processing
for fuel and gas production. The modern equipment utilized in these
processes benefits from the support of satellite technology. In
particular, China and India are the largest exporters of coal. Any
disruption in transportation means for exporting coal would
significantly impact countries that rely on coal for electricity
generation. The interconnectedness of the coal industry with satellite
communication highlights the critical role that this technology plays in
the smooth functioning of coal-related operations and its importance in
supporting electricity generation worldwide. Further exploration of the
potential implications of minimal to no satellite communication on the
coal industry and the subsequent impact on electricity generation will
be elaborated upon in subsequent sections of this article. Safeguarding
satellite communication systems becomes imperative to ensure the
continued stability and reliability of coal-related processes and power
generation in an increasingly energy-dependent global landscape. 2.3.3
Nuclear reactors, natural gas and liquid fuels The combined production
of energy from nuclear reactors, natural gas and liquid fuels represents
a significant portion of total energy, approximately 33.8% Statista
Research Department (2023d). Nuclear reactors heavily rely on computer
systems to monitor crucial parameters, such as pressure levels,
especially in the event of a failure. These monitoring systems depend on
satellite communication systems to process and store critical data.
Given the potential risks associated with nuclear reactors, including
scenarios such as coolant loss and water supply failure Nuclear Energy
Agency (2020), effective communication systems are essential for timely
response and mitigation efforts in nuclear emergencies. The absence of
reliable satellite communication could pose challenges in responding to
such emergencies, and in severe cases, it could necessitate permanent
reactor shutdowns to prevent meltdowns. Currently, the world has over
400 nuclear reactors Statista Research Department (2023b), making their
safety and efficient operation paramount to global energy stability. In
addition to nuclear power, natural gas and liquid fuels are crucial
energy resources, with numerous countries relying on their import for
electricity generation and various other applications. These resources
also depend on satellite communication systems for tasks such as mining,
efficient operations, and transportation. Any disruption in satellite
communication would hinder the prompt and smooth transportation of these
gases and fuels, potentially leading to electrical generation
constraints in various regions. The interdependence of nuclear reactors,
natural gas, and liquid fuels with satellite communication systems
underscores the critical role that this technology plays in ensuring
reliable energy production and supply. 2.3.3.1 Ensuring nuclear reactor
Safety and preparedness

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

The possibility of a [[nuclear **meltdown** due to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the minimization or [[loss of satellite]{.mark} function]{.underline} is
an exceptionally rare occurrence. It is vital to emphasize that the
nuclear power industry is committed to ensuring the utmost safety and
adheres to strict disaster prevention measures. Although we are
considering potential risks in this article, it is equally essential to
acknowledge the continuous efforts made by the nuclear industry to
improve safety and prevent catastrophic events.

In the case of a nuclear meltdown, where [**[water]{.mark}** supply and
essential **[systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} might be [affected
by]{.underline} a scenario such as [Kessler's Syndrome]{.underline},
nuclear power plants are equipped with 30-day emergency water supplies
known as Ultimate Heat Sinks (UHS). These UHS play a critical role in
cooling the reactor, even after it has been turned off Union of
Concerned Scientists (2010). Although the absence of electricity and
communication could make implementing these emergency measures
challenging, it is essential to remember that the occurrence of
Kessler's Syndrome is an unlikely event with a low probability of
impacting multiple nuclear reactors simultaneously.

If, hypothetically, [multiple reactors [**collapse** in]{.mark} a [short
time]{.mark} frame]{.underline}, the [release of **radiation** into the
environment]{.underline} could potentially [affect]{.underline} a
significant portion of [the **Earth's surface**]{.underline} Lelieveld
et al. (2012). However, it is crucial to reiterate that such a scenario
is extremely improbable and is based on [[multiple
**simultaneous**]{.mark} nuclear [accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the event of an emergency, nuclear reactors have two systems in
place: active and passive Xing et al. (2016). While the active system
requires electricity to operate, the passive system operates
independently, providing a safety measure even in situations of power
loss. The passive system would eventually shut down within a specified
time frame, typically between 72 h and 10 days, depending on the
facility Giges (2014). As a last resort, submerging nuclear rods in
seawater might be considered to cool the reactor. However, such a
measure is expensive and would render the nuclear facility temporarily
unusable, requiring significant financial investment to rebuild World
Nuclear Association (2022).

To reiterate, the risk of [a global nuclear **meltdown**]{.underline}
simultaneously affecting multiple reactors is remarkably low due to the
stringent safety protocols and disaster prevention measures upheld by
the nuclear power industry. This section has been included to raise
awareness of potential risks and to underscore the industry's ongoing
commitment to safety and the pursuit of alternative forms of energy that
could be less hazardous in the event of rare occurrences.

2.3.4 Other utilities

The essential services of water, gas and waste disposal are vital for
the maintenance of human life and the maintenance of a healthy living
environment American Geosciences Institute (2016), U.S. Energy
Information Administration (2023a) and The World Counts (2022). Water is
a fundamental necessity for every living being on Earth, while gas
serves crucial functions in cooking, heating, and various other
activities. Water and gas are generally delivered through pipelines to
homes, businesses, and industries, while in remote areas, gas can be
supplied using containers transported by vehicles American Geosciences
Institute (2016) and U.S. Energy Information Administration (2023a).
Delivery systems often rely on electric pumps, which, in turn, require
electricity to operate efficiently United States Space Force (2022b).

Some regions also utilize GNSS time to optimize water and gas
distribution to ensure equitable access United States Space Force
(2022b). However, in the absence of electricity and a reliable satellite
communication system, the supply of water and gas to many households
would be severely disrupted. Global statistics indicate that
approximately 71% of the population has access to clean water, while
approximately 60% has access to clean fuel for cooking Ritchie and Roser
(2019) and Ritchie et al. (2022). The loss of supply would significantly
affect people's daily lives and wellbeing.

The [**waste** disposal]{.underline} industry [is highly dependent
on]{.underline} the **[transportation]{.underline}** sector to collect
waste from homes and industries and transfer it to waste processing
sites. Electricity is essential for waste processing, and in 2022 alone
more than 1 billion tons of waste were collected worldwide The World
Counts (2022). Without adequate transportation facilities, many
households would face difficulties disposing of waste, leading to
potential health hazards and environmental concerns Ann (2023). The
interruption of these critical services due to the loss of satellite
communication systems and electricity highlights the need to protect
these technological infrastructures to ensure the smooth functioning of
essential utilities.

2.4 Importance of other types of satellites

Aside from navigation satellites, there are several other prominent
types of satellites, such as communication satellites, Earth observation
satellites, and astronomical satellites Sergieieva (2023). Communication
satellites aid in long-distance communication by filling the void left
by traditional ground-based networks, which primarily support
short-distance communication. These communication satellites act as
conduits for a variety of media transmissions, including radio,
television, phone, and internet services.

Earth observation satellites, on the other hand, are divided into two
categories: weather satellites and remote sensing satellites. Weather
satellites play an important role in a variety of industries, including
agriculture, fisheries, and transportation, by predicting and mitigating
the effects of adverse weather conditions. [Remote sensing
satellites]{.underline} Emery and Camps (2017), in turn, [make
significant contributions to]{.underline} resource exploration and
[monitoring]{.underline} of phenomena such as [**floods**, **droughts**,
soil moisture, **wildfires**, vegetation health, **forest**
degradation]{.underline}, road **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
surveillance, etc.,. Remote sensing satellites are used in the military
to capture high-resolution images of strategic locations, monitor enemy
activities, and assess potential threats.

Astronomical satellites serve a unique purpose in that they aid in the
identification of potential threats to Earth, such as asteroid impacts
and solar storms.

3 Impact on healthcare

Modern [[**medicine**]{.mark} is [heavily dependent]{.mark} on satellite
communication]{.underline} for efficient storage and retrieval of
patient data, electricity to power medical devices, and transportation
for patient and drug mobility. The [global [burden of
**disease**]{.mark} is [significant]{.mark}]{.underline}, with more than
95% of the population affected by various diseases and many individuals
experiencing multiple chronic or acute conditions. In Australia, low
back pain and depression are prevalent health problems with a
substantial impact on individuals Vos (2015).

In particular, [several major **health** challenges]{.underline}
continue to [pose significant **threats**]{.underline} to global
wellbeing. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes is over 500 million
people International Diabetes Federation (2021), with approximately 19.3
million people facing cancer Sung (2021) and about 38.4 million living
with HIV HIV.gov (2022). Managing these conditions requires meticulous
care, and in 2017, more than 50% of patients use health apps to help
with their medical management Stewart (2017). Furthermore, an estimated
310 million people undergo surgery annually International Surgical
Outcomes Study group (2016). Many other health issues, not mentioned
here, can be fatal if not properly treated in a timely manner.

[The efficient **functioning** of medical facilities]{.underline}
worldwide [requires]{.underline} reliable access to [**electricity** and
transportation facilities]{.underline}. Without these essential
resources, it would be impossible to provide adequate medical treatment
to patients, [leading to]{.underline} potentially millions or
[**billions** of deaths.]{.underline}

4 Impact on humans and other living beings

The rapid advancement of technology has significantly enriched human
life, fostering learning and growth while driving progress and
prosperity. In recent decades, technological innovations have brought
about transformative changes in how our minds and bodies adapt to the
modern world Clark (2007). In particular during the COVID-19 lockdown,
people turned to technology for entertainment and information, leading
to increased dependence on technological means Verbanas (2021).

In the United States alone, approximately 30% of adults are active
online, highlighting the widespread influence of technology on modern
society Verbanas (2021). While technology has facilitated various
aspects of life, concerns arise regarding the potential addiction to
technology, warranting a critical examination of its impact.

It is critical to recognize that the Kessler's Syndrome has primarily
indirect consequences due to modern society's intricate interdependence.
As a result, it is critical to emphasize the potential environmental
consequences, including impacts on mankind, if Kessler's Syndrome event
occurs, resulting in partial or complete loss of satellite access. This
analysis must also consider how human interventions, or their absence,
may alter the environmental landscape and circumstances.

As this article progresses, we will explore the implications of minimal
to no satellite function on human lifestyle, delving into how the [loss
of satellite **communication**]{.underline} systems could gradually or
[rapidly affect **global affairs**]{.underline}.

4.1 Impact on individuals

The impact of minimizing satellite functions on the digital
communication system is a critical concern that demands attention. While
the exact timeline of the consequences is uncertain, gradual
restrictions on communication services can escalate to the point where
effective communication becomes impossible. Such restrictions could
trigger panic among people as they experience the effects of reduced
satellite communication.

[Reduction in **banking** services]{.underline} due to the diminishing
capabilities of satellites may [exacerbate panic]{.underline}, leading
people to rush to stores to buy essential items and stock up with cash,
displaying anxiety and panic buying behaviors Leung et al. (2021). The
situation could escalate further if complete loss of satellite
communication occurs on a global scale. Governments would also face
challenges in carrying out special operations effectively without
adequate satellite support and might struggle to collaborate with allies
to find solutions. Shortfalls in government services and aid could
create uncertainty and panic among the population.

With limited resources, [essential needs such as [**food**,
**water**]{.mark}, and [shelter]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[become
**scarce**, leading to]{.mark} increased **[crime]{.mark}** and unsafe
living]{.underline} conditions. The heavy reliance of the modern world
on technology could exacerbate mental health concerns, as a significant
number of people experience nomophobia and Internet addiction Humood et
al. (2021) and Longstreet and Brooks (2017). The occurrence of mental
disorders could increase, given the substantial prevalence of such
conditions worldwide World Health Organization (WHO)
(2022).https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/

Basic needs, such as water, food, and shelter, could face significant
challenges due to the impacts of minimizing satellite functions. The
[lack]{.underline} or minimized availability [of **electricity**
could]{.underline} also [be **catastrophic**]{.underline}, as
demonstrated by studies suggesting that a large proportion of people are
not prepared with emergency supplies Bedard (2019) and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (2012). Inadequate healthcare services
due to the loss of satellite-dependent technology could lead to a
significant increase in fatalities related to poor healthcare quality
Kruk (2018).

The exact extent and duration of these effects depend on the speed of
loss of satellite communication systems and the potential adoption of
alternative systems. It is crucial for policymakers and relevant
stakeholders to recognize these implications and work towards
safeguarding satellite communication to mitigate potential negative
outcomes for humanity's wellbeing and progress.

4.2 Biodiversity and ecological imbalance

[[**Kessler's** Syndrome]{.mark},]{.underline} at its extremes,
[[poses]{.mark} a]{.underline} potential [[**threat** to
**humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark} and can [lead to ecological
**imbalances**]{.underline} in the global ecosystem Weisman (2007). The
continuous existence of numerous plant and animal species on Earth is
intricately connected to human activities. Human interventions, such as
the domestication and genetic modification of various plant species to
serve our needs, have shaped the current biodiversity Daru et al.
(2021).

However, [in the event of severe **disruptions** caused by
Kessler']{.underline}s Syndrome, certain
**[[plant]{.underline}]{.mark}** specie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
rely heavily on artificial herbicides and fertilizers for their survival
could [[face]{.mark} rapid **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} without
the assistance of humans in delivering those to plants. The sudden
removal of insecticides, which are commonly used in agricultural
practices, could also trigger a surge in population among insect
species. Consequently, this population increase may lead to a
corresponding increase in the numbers of insects that eat in the
ecosystem, including birds, rodents, reptiles, and others, [[causing a
**cascade** effect]{.mark} throughout the food chain.]{.underline}

The [potential **consequences**]{.underline} of these disruptions [on
biodiversity and ecological balance are **concerning**]{.underline}. The
loss of certain plant species could have far-reaching impacts on the
organisms dependent on them for food and habitat. Furthermore, changes
in insect populations could alter the dynamics of predator-prey
relationships, leading to unforeseen changes in the composition of
ecosystems UF Thompson Earth Systems Institute (2020).

JBlock

[[The U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} Defense Department [[must invest more to
upgrade sensors, communications]{.underline}]{.mark} and space-based
technologies [[**in the Arctic** to keep pace with China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} who are increasingly operating there,
including in joint military exercises, a new Pentagon strategy says.
Saying that **[[now is "a critical time" for the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[Deputy Defense
Secretary]{.underline}]{.mark} Kathleen [[Hicks told
reporters]{.underline}]{.mark} Monday that climate change, increased
activity by adversaries and degrading U.S. infrastructure are forcing
the department to rethink how to keep the Arctic secure and ensure
troops are well-equipped and protected. [[The Arctic
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} is short on specifics, but broadly
[[pushes for greater spending on high-tech sensor and radar
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, a range of military equipment, and
continued investment in Pituffik Space Base, the U.S. Space Force base
in the northwest corner of Greenland. And it relies on growing
partnerships with Canada and a number of NATO allies in the north.
Defense Department leaders have, for more than the past decade, warned
that [[**the U.S. needs to step up its activities in** the Arctic to
better compete with China and Russia as climate change makes
the]{.underline}]{.mark} frigid region more accessible. But the remote
northern expanse presents an array of challenges, including demands for
deep-water ports, weapons, drones and equipment that can withstand the
climate, and additional ships that can handle the cold waters and break
through the ice. The U.S. has also struggled with Cold War-era Defense
and State Department infrastructure that is degrading in the frigid
weather, and erosion on the coasts. The cold and increasingly
unpredictable weather also restricts military training and affects
equipment. And **[[the region, which has limited satellite coverage,
requires a far more expansive array of sensors for communications and
military awareness.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "Slowly over time, there's
been a bit of a greater awakening in the department," said Iris
Ferguson, the deputy assistant defense secretary for the Arctic. "Now
we're getting into the nitty gritty of how you implement a strategy."
The report notes that the Arctic is warming "more than three times
faster than the rest of the world\" and could see its first "practically
ice-free summer" by 2030. As the ice melts, the increased traffic, it
said, will boost the risks of accidents, miscalculation and
environmental degradation. Hicks couldn\'t quantify the increased
activity by Russia and China in the region, but she called the growing
cooperation between the two troubling. In 2022 and 2023, they conducted
joint military exercises off the coast of Alaska. Meanwhile, the melting
ice caps are opening sea lanes for longer periods of time each year,
making lucrative oil and gas deposits more accessible. And China has
provided critical funding to Russia for energy exploration. China has
also increased its own activity in the region, including by its three
icebreaker ships that do civil-military research in the region.
According to the report, Chinese vessels have tested underwater drones
and polar-capable aircraft there. Russia, which has the largest amount
of Arctic territory and has the most developed military presence there,
including important strategic nuclear capabilities, such as its
submarine-launched ballistic missile force. Going forward, the strategy
says [[the department will review options for better sensors,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} new space-based missile-warning and
**[[observational systems with greater polar
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Insufficient investments in early
warning and air defense sensors in the Arctic will increase risks to the
U.S. homeland, the report warns.

As the [[Russia-China axis further aligns itself against the U.S.
and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[NATO allies, the power struggle has
expanded to]{.underline}]{.mark} a new, previously ice-locked frontier:
**[[the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When [[American fighters
intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) [[over
Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} in July, the unprecedented move underscored
this increasingly assertive and expansive partnership. And while
[[Beijing and Moscow have been working to establish
a]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic [[foothold]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
region [[for more than a decade]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Washington and
Brussels are just now waking up to the threat]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[The clock is ticking, and the West is on thin
ice.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Just [[how important the Arctic is to Russia
in terms of maintaining its threatening nuclear
posture]{.underline}]{.mark} toward the U.S. **[[cannot be
overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a nuclear exchange, Moscow would
likely fire long-range ballistic missiles --- from ballistic missile
submarine bases near the Kola Peninsula --- through the poorly surveyed
airspace over Greenland. And [[hindered by low visibility in the Arctic,
U.S. forces would be ill-prepared to detect and counter the
strike.]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia has been building up this Arctic
force since its 2014 invasion of Crimea. In its efforts, melting sea ice
has presented both opportunities and challenges for the country. On the
one hand, the economic importance of Russia's Arctic coastline is
growing because of its commercialization as a feasible shipping route,
allowing Moscow to profit from providing short shipping routes for
commercial vessels carrying cargo between Asia and Europe. However, more
traffic also means Russia's control of its vast Arctic coastline ---
stretching from the Barents Sea in the west to the Bering Strait in the
east --- is now threatened. So, using a dense network of air defense,
aviation and ground forces at its Northern Fleet bases, Russia has been
focusing on closing off access to the Kola Peninsula at the Barents Sea
to protect its strategic submarine force and preserve the fleet's
year-round access to the Atlantic. It has also invested heavily in
precision-guided missile technology to threaten distant targets and
achieve sea denial without having to deploy traditional naval or air
forces. Additionally, in order to maintain and operate a strategic
submarine force near Alaska without relying on Northern Fleet repair
facilities at the other end of Eurasia, Russia has constructed new
hardened submarine shelter pens and repair and maintenance facilities
south of the Bering Strait near Vladivostok. Amid all this, as further
evidence of its "no-limits" partnership with Russia, China has been
developing its dual-use Arctic capabilities too, bolstering Russia's
ability to threaten the U.S. and its NATO allies while diverting
attention from the Indo-Pacific. It has also increased its regional
civilian and military cooperation with Moscow, linking its polar Silk
Road to the Russian Arctic by investing in infrastructure. As it stands,
[[China's polar satellites, unmanned underwater
vehicles]{.mark}]{.underline} and research vessels --- [[three of which
are icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[give Beijing an
edge]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of tracking shipping routes, mapping
the Arctic seabed and monitoring sea-ice and aerial movements. And with
the joint venture between Russia's state-owned nuclear energy firm
Rosatom and China's Hainan Yangpu NewNew Shipping company, the two
countries will now cooperate on building infrastructure and ice-class
container vessels to operate a year-round Arctic route. The
[[collaboration empowers Moscow to monitor and control
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} along its Arctic coastline, and
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} better protect Russian [[ballistic missile
submarines]{.underline}]{.mark} as well. Taken altogether, [[Russia's
and China's maritime, cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space capabilities
**[[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[threaten NATO's sparse
communications and data infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
region. Communications cables weren't built to withstand hybrid warfare.
Plus, **[[insufficient radars, surveillance drones, unmanned aircraft,
anti-submarine capable warships and satellite coverage make the U.S.
vulnerable to Russia's nuclear threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It simply
isn't enough for America to develop capabilities of its own.

**Arms Control Association '25,** "Questions to Ask About Proposals for
US. Space-Based Missile Interceptors",
<https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2025-06-10/questions-ask-about-proposals-us-space-based-missile-interceptors>
JBlock

Some proponents of Golden Dome have argued that the declining cost of
space launch makes the program economical. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark}
the recent public [[acrimony between]{.underline}]{.mark} Space X
executive Elon [[Musk and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration, [[it is
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n open [[question whether Golden Dome will benefit
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the vast [[reductions in]{.underline}]{.mark}
space-[[launch costs]{.underline}]{.mark} made possible [[through Space
X]{.underline}]{.mark} [[innovations]{.underline}]{.mark} over the last
decade. In the table above, the potential implications are reflected in
the sharp differences between the American Physical Society (APS)
estimates of launch costs, which adopt prices from the 2012 National
Research Council study, and the updated Congressional Budget Office
study, which assumes current, lower market rates. But space-launch costs
are only one of two key cost drivers. The other, equally important
factor is the size of a space-based missile defense constellation, or in
other words, the number of satellites involved. The size of the
constellation is, in turn, a function of other variables: how performant
the interceptor is, how quickly a decision to fire can be made
("decision time") which in turn depends on overall sensor-shooter system
integration, and what kind of threat the system is intended to handle.
The logic is simple. The faster and more agile the interceptor missile,
the fewer satellites are required but the heavier each will be. The
faster the system can decide to fire an interceptor, the more time the
interceptor missile will have to reach its target. And the more
sophisticated and numerous the threat envisioned, the more satellites
will be required. Leaving aside the cost of space launch and focusing on
the size of proposed constellations, there remain three primary
categories of questions. First, [[what type of interceptor will be
developed or adapted]{.underline}]{.mark} for Golden Dome? Will it be a
derivative of an existing type, such as the midcourse interceptors
deployed at sea on Navy Aegis ships or in siloes in Alaska and
California? The Department of Defense also has additional interceptor
development programs underway already: a Next-Generation Interceptor for
the siloed system, and a Glide-Phase Interceptor for Aegis optimized for
defeating hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. But **[[the first is not due
to enter service until 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [[the latter
until 2035. Given these timelines, how can another new interceptor be
designed, built, and tested successfully before the three-year
deadline]{.underline}]{.mark}? Second, what are the overall system's
performance requirements and goals for integrating sensors and shooters?
Because these metrics are likely to be classified, a more

integration requirements before spending billions]{.underline}]{.mark}
on an interceptor constellation which will only work if those metrics
are met? [[If the software and sensor integration effort
fails,]{.underline}]{.mark} is found to be impractical, or is delayed,
[[it would be wasteful to acquire]{.underline}]{.mark} and launch [[an
interceptor constellation that cannot perform]{.underline}]{.mark} as
designed. Third, what is the scope of the threat the system is designed
to handle, and what degree of responsibility will rest on the
space-based interceptors to manage that threat? If, as indicated by the
January 2025 "Iron Dome" executive order, the system will be asked to
defend against "any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland," then the
number of satellites needed in the constellation will be far higher than
in any of the models in the table above. All of those models assumed
that the constellation would be designed to defeat only a rogue state
threat. Further, as the 2025 American Physical Society study indicates,
mandating [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} requirement that the [[system be
capable of defeating a salvo-launch would increase the satellite
requirement]{.underline}]{.mark} by an order of magnitude, **[[to

#### Space colonization doesn't solve extinction.

In the other direction, among the downward paths, questions about space
loom even larger. As the four horsemen of the anthropogenic apocalypse
and other perils, natural and human-made, have come into view, [the
**expectation** that space can play a **uniquely** and **decisively
positive** role in either **fixing Earth problems** or **escaping** from
them has become an unquestioned **article of faith**, endlessly repeated
by]{.underline} space advocates as well as most [analysts of
catastrophic]{.underline} and existential [threats]{.underline}. If "all
humanity's eggs are in the one vulnerable and fraying basket" of the
Earth, as widely proclaimed, then spreading human settlements into the
cosmos seems a straightforward path to human survival. And if asteroids
colliding with the Earth are a threat to civilization and the species,
then a space program to detect and divert them becomes vitally
necessary. [The **overwhelmingly dominant** view is that space
activities have an **entirely positive role** to play in addressing
perils to]{.underline} human [survival]{.underline}. In contrast to many
technologies that promise both perils and benefits and that must,
somehow, be partly restrained, [[the question is not whether **space
efforts** are **desirable** but]{.mark} rather how soon they can be made
**[feasible]{.mark}**. Despite the **breadth** and **sophistication** of
their visionary thinking, [neither space expansionists nor
analysts]{.mark} of catastrophes [give]{.mark} much [**consideration**
to]{.mark} possible [ways]{.mark} in which [space]{.mark} activities
[might **exacerbate** or **trigger**]{.mark} existing
**[threats]{.mark}** or create new ones]{.underline}.11 In futurist
thinking about technogenic threats, [large-scale space expansion enjoys
a **special status**, a **space exceptionalism**]{.underline}, which in
turn is supported by and supports a space exemptionalism, [a **free
pass** from a **serious consideration** of its **possible
downsides**]{.underline}.

Is this strongly optimistic view of space and macrodisasters well
founded? In opening this question and weighing space ventures as sources
of such threats as well as solutions to and escapes from them, this
analysis raises the possibility that many significant space activities
should be restrained or relinquished on the same grounds that many now
believe them to be an unalloyed good, and that [human [survival]{.mark}
may **actually [hinge]{.mark}** [on the ability]{.mark} of governance
[to **avoid** rather than **undertake**]{.mark} major space expansions.
It is **certain** that the Earth will become uninhabitable over the very
long term of **hundreds of millions and billions** of years into the
future, and that humanity can survive only by leaving the Earth and
**migrating elsewhere** in the cosmos. But these [threats are so]{.mark}
**temporally [distant]{.mark}** [that they]{.mark} can [have
**absolutely no relevance** to current]{.mark} human
**[choices]{.mark}** and **activities**]{.underline}. Many of the
[[threats]{.mark} imminent within the **next centuries**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} significantly [[of **human origin**, and space
expansionists rarely consider]{.mark} the [possibility that]{.mark} the
patterns of [**human activity** producing]{.mark} these [threats might
be **carried into space**]{.mark} along with the **spread of humans**.
[Nor do they consider whether regimes to restrain]{.mark}]{.underline}
threatening [[technologies, if **established on Earth**, can persist
if]{.mark} human [polities spread **across the solar
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unless science finds a better solution, human [[space colonization is
bound to inevitably fail]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are challenges that
are nearly impossible to overcome. The distance to the exoplanet Proxima
Centauri b in the three-star solar system Alpha Centauri is 4.2
light-years. In the vastness of space, that's almost next door. Even if
this exo-planet turned out to be habitable, [[a flight there would take
5,000 years or]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[more]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The only solution is to put people into a 'Generation Ship,' where your
descendants' descendants will arrive at the destination (not you).
**[[What if this planet turns out to be uninhabitable when we get
there]{.underline}]{.mark}**? What's next? Coming back to Earth? Or
aimlessly venturing into deep space? If you decide to return, your
descendants --- or their descendants --- will be the ones arriving back
on Earth, not you. And what if the spaceship gets hit by an asteroid or
space debris on its way back? More importanly, [[how do you keep the
ship on course to a moving target that's light-years away? How do you
feed your humans]{.underline}]{.mark} on the way there or return? [[How
do you generate]{.underline}]{.mark} enough
[[oxygen]{.underline}]{.mark}? How do you stop them from getting cancer
from all the hard radiation? [[What about deadly solar
storms]{.underline}]{.mark} in these star systems? What about the solar
storm from our sun? [[It could wipe out the entire
crew]{.underline}]{.mark}. For such a mission to succeed, successive
generations would have to live and die in transit. And some crew members
would have to be awake to watch over the spacecraft and the passenger
support system. To keep the mission going across the centuries, the crew
would have to renew itself by having children. But **[[conceiving
offsprings in space is challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the
confinements of a space ship, Astronauts would have a limited choice of
partners. Even if some solutions are available, is human hibernation
feasible? Could a non-hibernating skeleton crew function in a sane way?
And how would the human act of copulation play out --- both
mechanically, in terms of being in reduced-gravity enviroment, and
genetically, [[in terms of possible inbreeding if a ship can't hold at
least 40,000 colonists to maintain a diverse gene pool and avoid
congenital disorders?]{.mark}]{.underline} Even if genetically enhanced
humans ever ventured out to conquer the galaxy, they would have to adapt
not just their bodies but their minds. Can the crew members remain sane
for 5,000 years locked in a spaceship going into the unknown? The
smallest irritants can explode into dramatic fights. The problem is that
you can't escape the situation; you can't remove yourself to cool down
because you're always in close proximity. What if somebody decides to
open an airlock or subvert the mission out of anger? Think of how many
fights have broken out between humans in the past 100 years in their
natural habitat. Now think of how many fights would break out over the
course of several thousand years. Anti-matter fuel can help you cross
enormous distances in no time. It's easy to make anti-matter if you
happen to be at the largest particle accelerator, CERN, which draws 120
gigawatts of current, equivalent to powering 300,000 homes. To make 1
gram of anti-matter, you need 1 billion years under current
technological conditions. So, this lengthy process doesn't guarantee
anything, and you'd be better off walking to Alpha Centauri. There are
many other problems we need to solve, or perhaps we never will. Some of
these limiations are near impossible to solve. **[[Humans are
biologically very optimistic, not realistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For
example, the chances of dying in a motorcycle accident are higher
compared to using other forms of transportation, but our brains ignore
this fact and continue to enjoy riding.

Bostrom is talking about the conditions for which living a human life is
worthwhile, or 'a life worth living'. It made me consider [[at what

this]{.underline}]{.mark} for the entire human population[[? I don't

to establish 'minimally favourable conditions' for the entire human
population, given that we can support human life in Earth orbit for long
durations? And if not, at what stage of colonisation would we expect to
achieve this goal? When we settle on the Moon? Mars? Colonise the solar
system? A rhetorical question worth consideration.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced his intention to relocate a million
people to Mars by 2050. However, [[a well-known
astrophysicist]{.underline}]{.mark} and a member of the royal family of
Great Britain with the title Astronomer Royal Martin Rees [[expressed
doubts]{.underline}]{.mark} at such a fast pace. The astrophysicist
frankly [[calls]{.underline}]{.mark} Musk's plans a "dangerous
illusion." Rees expressed his views while participating in the House of
Lords podcast "Lord Speaker's Corner," where he described Musk as an
"extraordinary figure with a rather strange character," which might
indicate a growing unpredictability. "I don't think Elon Musk's plans
are realistic. Perhaps only some brave pioneers will be able to live on
Mars. [[The idea of mass migration to avoid Earth's
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}, which he (Elon Musk) and several other
space enthusiasts adopted, in my opinion, is **[[a dangerous
illusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Rees notes. Rees suggests financing
space research privately, rather than using public funds, as is the case
with NASA and SpaceX. The astrophysicist argues that governments should
be more careful about crew safety, which makes space programs extremely
costly. Therefore, manned missions to Mars will be a very expensive
initiative --- more expensive than all space programs combined. "The
main part of research in space should be carried out by remotely
controlled robots. In cases where it is impossible to do without people,
such space missions should be funded by private companies, but not at
the expense of public funds," Rees believes. The [[problems highlighted
by Rees relate to the adaptation of the human body to
space]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions, **[[which can be extremely
harmful to health]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Perhaps]{.underline}]{.mark}
he is right that **[[it is necessary to solve Earth's problems first

[A crucial]{.underline} additional [parameter]{.underline} of this
scenario [is **temporal**: How much time will be required to realize

[[presuppose]{.underline}]{.mark} large and [**[sustained
investments]{.mark}** in space, which are **unlikely**]{.underline}. 5
But [[it seems **plausible**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [these [steps
might be accomplished over **several centuries**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, [this schedule assumes]{.underline} that [the Earth will be
**willing** and **able** to provide significant]{.underline} initial
[support for colonization. The question of how rapidly]{.underline}
self-sufficient [colonies could be established has **direct
implications** for their ability to serve as hedges to]{.underline}
terrestrial catastrophic and **[existential threats]{.underline}**.
[Based on the]{.underline} earlier [analysis of technological

success scenario [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [**possible**, with
**critical uncertainties** about health and artificial
biospheres]{.underline}. But [this scenario is]{.underline} also
[**[very improbable]{.mark}** for many strong reasons. [Inaction,
failure, or]{.mark} **debilitating [conflict]{.mark}** [are more
likely]{.mark} than success. Colonization may]{.underline} [not be
attempted because [it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} too
[[**difficult** and **expensive**]{.mark}, or]{.underline} because of
growing [Earth problems and troubles. [Off-Earth living could be **too
unhealthy**]{.mark}]{.underline} for humans, [and [**reproduction** and
**child growth**]{.mark} in low-gravity environments [may be
infeasible]{.mark}]{.underline}, confining viable habitat to spinable
artificial bodies. Potent [pathogens might evolve]{.mark} in novel space
environments. [Artificial ecosystems could be]{.mark} too
[difficult]{.mark} to create and sustain. [People may not want
to]{.mark} live on Mars or an a[steroid]{.underline}, for the same
reasons they do not live in the middle of the Sahara or Antarctica. Or
[colonization might be attempted and]{.underline} quickly [**fail**,
like Norse Vineland in Newfoundland or Scot Darien in Panama. Or a
colony might be]{.underline} only [minimally successful and linger as a
**remote**]{.underline}, climate-stunted [**backwater**, like
early]{.underline} modern [Iceland. Space [colonies might
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[like]{.underline}]{.mark} the many **[[failed

Diamond in Collapse. 6 [[The small population]{.underline}]{.mark} of a
space settlement [[might succumb to disease or]{.underline}]{.mark}
[debilitating]{.underline} internecine [conflict. Conflicts over the
**limited number of**]{.underline} metal-bearing [**asteroids** might
start early]{.underline}. 7 [The sponsoring Earth agent might abandon
its colony]{.underline} due to shifting priorities, insufficient
resources, or diverting conflicts. [If interstate rivalry propels
colonization it will happen]{.underline} more [rapidly but]{.underline}
will [also]{.underline} be more likely to [involve violence sooner. If
**rivalrous states** establish colonies, **conflict**]{.underline}
between them [might]{.underline} beggar and hobble \[[hinder\] all.
There may be a vast gap between a colony that can be kept operational
with]{.underline} continual [inputs from Earth and one that is capable
of persisting **without**]{.underline} any **[Earth
support]{.underline}**. If, as Sagan proposed, large-scale settlement is
delayed until after major terrestrial problems have been solved, the
prospects for success rise, while the rationales weaken and the time
frames lengthen. And [as colonization becomes imminent,
doubts]{.underline} of the sort voiced here [may lead to **organized
opposition**]{.underline}. [The success scenario]{.underline}, and much
of space expansionist thinking, [operates with [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
implicit [**[assumption]{.mark}** that space [settlement will be
propelled by]{.mark}]{.underline} numerous [**[capable agents]{.mark}**
committed to advancing the **long-term success** of humanity. This
[is]{.mark} a **[dubious]{.mark}** assumption, [given
that]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Earth's]{.underline}]{.mark} growing
[[problems have **yet to stimulate**]{.mark} the emergence
of]{.underline} numerous [[powerful agents]{.mark} committed to
advancing **even**]{.underline} the species' [**short-term
success**.]{.underline} And [if powerful actors were motivated by
long-term species interest, colonization would be much less
necessary.]{.underline} The success scenario also assumes that different
space ventures build on each other when they [The success
scenario]{.underline} also [operates with]{.underline} what can be
called [the Benign Parent Model]{.underline} of Terra-Colony Relations.
In this approach, Earth [**lavishes resources** on its space colonial

until they are able to direct and support themselves. Constitutions for
space polities embodying the best of Terran political wisdom are
established. [This]{.underline} model, however, [is]{.underline} almost
[**entirely at variance** with the **historical experience**
of]{.underline} terrestrial [colonization]{.underline} and the
incentives of relevant self-interested actors. [To the extent
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} or corporations [invest in space colonies,
they]{.underline} will [want to **maintain control** and reap the
benefits]{.underline} of their investments. [To the extent they
anticipate **colonial independence**, they **will not
invest**]{.underline}; if they do, [they [will try to keep colonies
**small** and **dependent**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The success scenario
also assumes that different [space ventures]{.underline} build on each
other when they [might **subvert** and **impede** one
another]{.underline}. The two central projects, [Mars colonization and
asteroidal resource extraction, might be quite antagonistic.
Wealth]{.underline} generated [from space resources will]{.underline}
most probably [be repatriated to Earth, not plowed into]{.underline}
space [habitat construction. Asteroidal exploitation is likely to
be]{.underline} capital- and [robot-intensive, with a minimal
human]{.underline} labor [force]{.underline} rotating through small
off-world bases, as on off-shore oil rigs. If resources from asteroids
are the bonanza some anticipate, the [beneficiaries of this wealth

possession [and can be expected to **actively oppose colonization**. The

their [incentive to **impede space settlements**]{.underline}. And [once

Forget the "Pax Americana." **[[The unipolar
moment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that brief interlude where the United
States reigned supreme, [[is over]{.underline}]{.mark}. China's rise,
coupled with a growing discontent with the American-led rules-based
international order, has ushered in a new era: a multipolar world with
multiple power centers jostling for influence. This dynamic shift
demands a new foreign policy strategy on the part of all states. Enter
multi-alignment, a strategic response to this new multipolar reality
that involves countries forging partnerships across ideological and
geopolitical divides to advance their national interests. Unlike the
rigid alliances of the Cold War, [[multi-alignment involves a strategic
flexibility that empowers nations to navigate the complexities of a
multipolar world]{.underline}]{.mark}. These partnerships are often
issue-specific and impermanent, allowing countries to cooperate with
different great powers depending on the context. For instance, a nation
might partner with the U.S. on matters of regional security while
forging economic ties with China. This adaptability ensures that a
country's national interests are prioritized --- [[if cooperation with a
particular power becomes detrimental, they can
shift]{.mark}]{.underline} their focus and seek partnerships elsewhere.
This approach is particularly attractive for middle powers. These
countries, with growing influence but not the global reach of
superpowers, can leverage their strategic weight to extract benefits
from various partners within the multipolar system; they can secure
vital resources, expand their economic opportunities and exert greater
influence on the international stage. In essence, multi-alignment
[[allows middle powers to play multiple sides, maximizing their
strategic gains]{.underline}]{.mark} within a multipolar landscape. The
Middle East is shifting dramatically under the influence of
multi-alignment. Once a region defined by a rigid U.S.-led alliance
system, the rise of China is rewriting the script. A powerful
illustration of this transformation is [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}
recent [[success in brokering a thaw between]{.underline}]{.mark}
regional [[rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. This
unprecedented]{.underline}]{.mark} diplomatic feat [[underscores the
transformative power of multi-alignment]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
traditional allies are no longer bound by rigid geopolitical ties or
past membership in a bloc, but are free to pursue partnerships based on
specific interests. The implications for the Middle East are profound,
potentially paving the way for a more stable regional order. We see this
with how Saudi Arabia, a long-standing American ally, is deepening
economic ties with China for investment and diversification away from
oil dependence, while still maintaining its security relationship with
the U.S. Similarly, Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates have
fostered partnerships with both China and Russia, seeking economic
opportunities and diplomatic support on regional issues. This
multi-alignment allows these states to navigate the complexities of a
multipolar world and secure their interests within the new power
dynamic. In Southeast Asia, countries like Vietnam and Indonesia have
long balanced relations between the U.S. and China, but China's growing
assertiveness in the South China Sea has spurred a reevaluation.
[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite its communist ideology, [[has
strengthened its defense ties with the U.S. while maintaining economic
relations with China. Indonesia]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[seeks
to maintain its neutrality but has also engaged in joint military
exercises with both the U.S. and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
multi-alignment strategy allows these countries to hedge against Chinese
dominance while ensuring access to vital markets in a multipolar
economic landscape. The rise of multi-alignment within a multipolar
world presents both opportunities and challenges for international peace
and security. On the one hand, it offers a more nuanced approach to
global challenges. With power diffused across multiple actors,
decisionmaking becomes less centralized and more responsive to specific
regional contexts. This [[allows for solutions tailored to the unique
needs of each situation]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than a
one-size-fits-all approach. Multi-alignment can also **[[incentivize
cooperation between former rivals on shared threats like climate change
or pandemics,]{.underline}]{.mark}** encouraging countries to
collaborate on solutions despite past geopolitical differences.

American Hegemony",

[[Empires don't just fall]{.mark} like toppled trees. Instead, [they
weaken slowly as a succession of crises drain their strength and
confidence]{.mark} until they suddenly begin to disintegrate. So it was
with the British, French, and Soviet empires; [so it now is with]{.mark}
imperial [America]{.mark}.]{.underline} Great Britain confronted serious
colonial crises in India, Iran, and Palestine before plunging headlong
into the Suez Canal and imperial collapse in 1956. In the later years of
the Cold War, the Soviet Union faced its own challenges in
Czechoslovakia, Egypt, and Ethiopia before crashing into a brick wall in
its war in Afghanistan. [[America's post-Cold War victory lap suffered
its own crisis early in this century with]{.underline}]{.mark}
disastrous invasions of [[Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Now, looming]{.underline}]{.mark} just over history's horizon [[are
three]{.underline}]{.mark} more imperial **[[crises in Gaza, Taiwan, and
Ukraine that could cumulatively turn a slow imperial recessional into an
all-too-rapid decline, if not collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a
start, let's put the very idea of an imperial crisis in perspective. The
[[history of every empire]{.underline}]{.mark}, ancient or modern,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} always **[[involved a succession of
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}**---usually mastered in the empire's earlier
years, only to be ever more disastrously mishandled in its era of
decline. Right after World War II, when the United States became
history's most powerful empire, Washington's leaders skillfully handled
just such crises in Greece, Berlin, Italy, and France, and somewhat less
skillfully but not disastrously in a Korean War that never quite
officially ended. Even after the dual disasters of a bungled covert
invasion of Cuba in 1961 and a conventional war in Vietnam that went all
too disastrously awry in the 1960s and early 1970s, Washington proved
capable of recalibrating effectively enough to outlast the Soviet Union,
"win" the Cold War, and become the "lone superpower" on this planet. In
both success and failure, crisis management usually entails a delicate
balance between domestic politics and global geopolitics. President John
F. Kennedy's White House, manipulated by the CIA into the disastrous
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, managed to recover its political
balance sufficiently to check the Pentagon and achieve a diplomatic
resolution of the dangerous 1962 Cuban missile crisis with the Soviet
Union. America's current plight, however, can be traced at least in part
to a growing imbalance between a domestic politics that appears to be
coming apart at the seams and a series of challenging global upheavals.
Whether in Gaza, Ukraine, or even Taiwan, the Washington of President
Joe [[Biden is clearly failing to align]{.mark}]{.underline} domestic
political [[constituencies with the]{.underline}]{.mark} empire's
[[international interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in each case,
[[crisis mismanagement has only been compounded by errors that have
accumulated in the decades since the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
end, turning each crisis into a conundrum without an easy resolution or
perhaps any resolution at all. Both individually and collectively, then,
the mishandling of these crises is likely to prove a significant marker
of America's ultimate decline as a global power, both at home and
abroad.
