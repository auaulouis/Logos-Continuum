Earlier, Kane distanced himself from "the men" through
pseudoanthropological assumptions that the upper-class men were somehow
better able to cope with diseases. Furthermore, though he enjoyed the
theatre immensely, Kane continually reminded his readers that this
recreational activity was exclusively arranged by the lower decks so as
to create distance between himself and this occasionally gaudy pastime.
But on Christmas Day in 1850, Kane dropped these pretensions and, in
unity with the crew, fought the onset of depression by sharing in
alcohol, laughter and music. [The "negro songs" of Christmas Day were a
particularly potent cultural signifier around which the American men
could assemble. The segregated crew were able to eschew their class
divisions and cohere around the subjugated African-American, the
racially defined Other reminding the men that whatever their differences
in material possession and education, they enjoyed the presumption of
white identity]{.underline}.96 Though it is not known which songs were
sung that night, in Passed Midshipman Robert Randolph Carter's published
account of the expedition, he notes that they were: "Patriotic and
sentimental."97 As will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4[,
plantation songs made popular by Stephen Foster would resonate deeply
with the lower decks of polar expeditions for their depictions of
suffering but faithful slaves, providing a figurative language for the
sailors with which to describe and vent their own afflictions while
keeping racial hierarchies firmly in place]{.underline}. Here however,
it is sufficient to note that these "sentimental" songs would have no
doubt reminded the men of home. [That they chose racially offensive
songs about African-Americans as a means to conjure up nostalgic
feelings reads as particularly troubling: it suggests the
institutionalisation of black pain elicited a positive emotional
response, a yearning for the comforts and contours of systematised
racism while living in a liminal, frozen land where most known social
and environmental realities had been turned unreal by the dominating
environment]{.underline}. Worse yet, the men sang the songs on one of
the most important Christian days of the year, the story of the birth of
Jesus Christ and his mission of brotherhood and forgiveness not far from
their minds surely. This picture is complicated because these songs
were, in fact, attributed to black society by the whites that sung them.
[While their inherent racism may have made them comforting to the crew,
the very fact of their association with "blackness" suggests that
however repulsed by African-Americans they were, the men saw racially
defined Others as part of the make up of their national consciousness.
They turned the African-American Others into "symbolic figures that
could be rhetorically interior to the society they sought to
inaugurate."]{.underline}98 [These songs were, as stated, both
sentimental and patriotic -- they were regarded as a distinctly American
phenomenon. It is telling that after the singing of the minstrel songs,
the men went on to give a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the
national anthem and the "negro song" sitting side by side in a night of
nationalistic reverence.99]{.underline} [The expedition, ostensibly a
search-and-rescue mission, **created an enduring fascination and
colonial interest with the Arctic**. The heroic endeavours of the men
and their subsequent narrativisation by Kane helped construct new,
imperialist ideas of American nationhood both at home and in the Arctic.
But in these embryonic moments of geographic and symbolic expansion, the
men felt compelled to include commodified "black" cultural formations --
American flags planted to the soundtrack of slavery. Furthermore, at a
time when scurvy was decimating the men by forcing the reliving of
previous injury and pain, the nostalgic, sentimental spectre of the
suffering black body was conjured as a cultural assemblage around which
to gather.]{.underline} Perhaps [the projection of black corporeal
failings, brought on by the hands of whites, allowed the men to tap into
feelings of pain, to cathartically work through the diseases dismantling
their bodies]{.underline}. [But any moment of identification with black
pain was a one-way, conceited process, the sentimentalisation of
plantations and the sanitisation of their history precluding any
understanding of suffering. After the night of homesickness, songs and
laughter, the men continued to cheer their spirits, the minstrel songs
soon forgotten but their powerful effects still lingerin]{.underline}g.
"In fact, we were very happy fellows. We had had a foot-race in the
morning over the midnight ice for three purses of a flannel shirt each,
and a splicing of the main-brace. The day was night, the stars shining
feebly through the mist."100 To conclude, believing that the uneducated
would excite themselves with "imaginary terrors," Kane exposed the
harrowing introspection suffered by sailors while at the same time
pathologising it based on shipboard hierarchies, hierarchies shared in
common by British and American expeditions. The theatre, however, was an
altogether more democratic and occasionally gaudy affair, departing from
the British upper-class image of how drama should be produced and
performed. [The "negro songs" proved to be a fitting American
contribution to the canon of polar performance: through ridicule of the
black Other, the segregated crew was momentarily able to unify on
Christmas Day, the commodification of "black" culture so paramount to
white American identity that it was brought thousands of miles to Arctic
shores.]{.underline}

#### This irresistible desire to consume black flesh reflects the accumulation of antiblack violence and the means by which black bodies are rendered fungible-- The registers of gratuitous violence reveal a fetishisms, depravity and incalculable impact

**[When Black men do appear in Laaksonen's pieces, they're nearly always
an accessory to white desire.]{.underline}** One seared in my memory
depicts a white man being assaulted by four Black men. Another shows a
Black man being belt-whipped by two white men. As scholar Franklin
Howard explains, "[Tom sexualized potential police brutality and
visually represented the social imbalance of power in his erotic art.
**Black men cannot even pleasure each other without the presence of
white man."**]{.underline} A clear example that Howard cites is Tom's
Untitled (1988), [a drawing where two cops bend a Black man over the
hood of a police car while one prepares to penetrate him.]{.underline}
There's only [s**o much point to assigning ethics to erotica, but at the
same time, when compounded with the ongoing conversation on
state-sanctioned violence... yikes**]{.underline}**.** But the
[c**ommodification of Black fetishism among supposed "radicals" remains
timeless.** Both **Laaksonen and these protesters with sex-centered
signs place Blackness in a prop position while whiteness remains the
star.**]{.underline} Still, Laaksonen is no Robert Mapplethorpe, the
late, "edgy" homoerotic photographer. Mapplethorpe's faceless,
crotch-fixed photos of Black men in the 1980s are probably the best case
study for art that speaks to today's dick-crazed protest posters. His
1980 photograph "Man in Polyester Suit" is famously controversial for
its exposure of the Black subject's penis out of the fly of dress pants.
The piece has become the blueprint for shenanigans of this flavor.
Mapplethorpe went for it to the point that Milton Moore, the subject of
"Man in Polyester Suit" and many other photographs, is believed to have
once said he felt primitive beneath Mapplethorpe's gaze: **["I think he
saw me like a monkey in a zoo.]{.underline}"** [Sometimes I think that
my penis --- if magically granted autonomy to leap off my body and live
its own life --- might be valued more highly and by more people than my
entire being. **Black body parts are always profitable.** But once our
voices and brains get too involved, **attempts to edit or silence us are
never far off.** That's the simple truth for Black people enduring
racial capitalism.]{.underline}

#### And this scientific and scholarly fantasy to explore and develop posits circumpolar space as a "terra incognita" - This settler adventurism authorizes violent capture, occupation and erasure of indigenous peoples and sets the stage for an extraction and exploitation

We start with [scientists]{.underline}. Their [concepts and research
practices have accompanied efforts to conquer, cajole, civilize,
capitalize, consume, and conserve the far north since the late
1800s]{.underline}. It may feel odd for some readers to link the pursuit
of truths about the natural world with colonialism, especially in such a
sparsely populated zone. But [reflect for a moment on the most popular
chapter of Arctic history: the search for the North Pole. As historians
have deftly shown, American, Danish, and Norwegian explorers scoured the
Arctic Ocean at the turn of the twentieth century not simply to seek out
adventure but to find the world's remaining unclaimed
lands]{.underline}. [They returned south as national heroes because they
expanded their home country's territorial possessions]{.underline}.
[**Redrawing maps to display their discoveries**, they sprinkled the
names of sponsors on bays, islands, straits, and narrows. In these
material ways, **explorers extended Euro-American authority over the
Arctic**.]{.underline}3 [Like their maps, **explorers' tales about an
Arctic terra incognita and savage Inuit helped southerners claim the
north.**]{.underline} [With their words, they painted the Arctic as
isolated and inhospitable]{.underline}. At times, [they portrayed Inuit
communities as backward for relying on Stone Age technologies for
survival and primitive because they appeared to know neither religion
nor law]{.underline}. [In other instances, Inuit were
strong---superhuman, even---for subsisting in an environment without
trees, warmth, or readily accessible game]{.underline}. Historians
analyze these depictions of the Arctic in relation to when they were
produced and the dramas playing out at that time. [**Explorers'
narratives were products of metropolitan societies concerned with the
effects of overcivilization**, a softness emerging from the urban
existence that replaced life on the farm over the end of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}. [Those who consumed scientific ideas measured the
Arctic against the norms of the Euro-American experience, reifying that
experience as superior.]{.underline} [An exotic place, one uninfluenced
by machines and morality, then, was not an objective observation, but a
view through imperial eyes]{.underline}.4 The ways historians have
unpacked polar exploration illustrates the conceptual framework of this
book. That is, [**scientific representations of Arctic nature are
entangled with human interventions in the region**. A map of the North
Pole in 1909 was not an exact reproduction of the physical environment
of coastlines and ocean currents. Instead, it was a document born from
particular field experiences in particular places and widely held
desires for global dominance.]{.underline} Philosopher Ian Hacking puts
it this way: "Science is said to have two aims: theory and experiment.
Theories try to say how the world is. Experiment and subsequent
technology change the world. We represent and we intervene. We represent
in order to intervene, and we intervene in light of our
representations." Perhaps readers already understand this relationship
intuitively, given the adage "knowledge is power."[**5 Polar exploration
is just one example of the pursuit of knowledge converging with colonial
ambition in the Arctic.** Ideas of nature changed over time. New
paradigms pushed researchers to ask different questions about the north
just as human activity there altered the environment, requiring
continued analysis]{.underline}. I use the term scientist to refer to an
unwieldy group of people, from museum-based naturalists in the late
1800s to geophysicists working for military agencies during World War II
to ecologists translating research into political activism in the 1960s.
The differences among them are many, but what they share is this: at the
moment they appear in this book, they compete for the mantle on
definitive questions of scientific understanding, natural resource
management, and national development. In these ways, [the
nineteenth-century specimen collector inhabits a social and intellectual
space similar to the climate scientist today. By bringing these
practitioners together in this way, we thread diverse representations
and interventions in different historical periods in a line---thus
reconnecting the Arctic's colonial past with its present.6]{.underline}

[The issue of white male failure at the North Pole takes on another
meaning in Julien's work, since here failure is connected to the ways
late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century polar expeditions were
exclusively white and male undertakings]{.underline}, forging what I
called in [Gender on Ice "a discourse of nationalism, empire, and white
male heroism.]{.underline}"25 In contrast to the British, [the Americans
tried to produce a narrative of masculinity that was part of a
scientific tradition,]{.underline} which worked discursively to exclude
the significant presence of Inuit people and the participation of
Matthew Henson from the account. **[In the American narrative, there is
a larger emphasis on the actions of flesh-and-blood heroic
men.]{.underline} [Successful performance, athleticism, and scientific
achievement matter most]{.underline}.** While the tragedy of Scott's
failed expedition to the South Pole is acceptable within the parameters
of the literary, there is no place for failure within the ideological
narrative of scientific progress and athletic performance that framed
the discourses of Robert Peary's expedition.26 That is why the fact that
Henson was obliged literally to carry Peary back on his sledge from the
North Pole (because Peary had lost nine of his toes, which made it an
ordeal for him to wear snowshoes) was not made public by Henson until
1966, over forty years after Peary died.27 Even though Peary's
expedition was supposed to be scientific, his "faithful record" at the
North Pole was from the start contested and unstable and remains to this
day highly disputed and controversial.28 [This inability to acknowledge
outright the failure of the expedition, I argue, explains the
significance of Henson as the major corroborating witness and the narrow
focus of the critique of Peary, which has centered on establishing or
disputing the accuracy of his claim to have reached the
Pole.]{.underline} Therefore, the narrative of Scott's failed expedition
to the South Pole resonated more widely than that of the Peary
expedition's claim. Inspired by the events of the 1909 expedition to the
North Pole, Julien's True North (2004--2008) [**revisualizes the
Arctic,** taking on the competing stories of Peary's controversial
expedition, **which radically altered the lives of his longtime African
American exploration partner Matthew Henson and the Inuit men and women
of Ellesmere Island and northern Greenland** (figures 2.10 and
2.11).]{.underline}29 The title, True North, **[references how polar
exploration might have had a different meaning for Henson than for white
polar explorers at that time]{.underline}.** Robert Stepto has argued
that "[t**he seminal journey in Afro-American narrative literature is
unquestionably north,"**]{.underline} and one can see that Henson's
autobiography, A Black Explorer at the North Pole, **[extends the
geography of freedom mapped so often in the African American literary
tradition that dates back to the antebellum slave
narratives]{.underline}.**30 Though Henson was born to freed slaves, his
family was persecuted by the Ku Klux Klan, and he and his family
subsequently ended up in Washington, DC, to escape terror and
discrimination. But the long and dark history of slavery was not
entirely a matter of the past in the age of Jim Crow, even in the
nation's capital. Henson himself became an orphan by the age of twelve,
and before he started to work for Peary, he survived by going to sea as
a cabin boy; he traveled to ports as far away as China, Japan, Africa,
and the Russian Arctic seas to escape persecution. The film and
installation True North (2004--2008) is usually shown as a large-scale
multiple-screen audiovisual installation and offers one of the boldest
examples of the new departure in the artistic and scholarly discourse on
polar expedition narratives. [Like Aglert's work, True North brings us
back to the Heroic Age of exploration. During that period, many of the
Arctic regions had not yet achieved independent Indigenous
self-governance systems.]{.underline} That did not come until a century
later, as did Nunavut's independence in 1999 and Greenland's in 2008;
both continue to remain part of larger countries (Canada and Denmark,
respectively).31 In Euro-American histories of the Arctic, the heroic
era is often seen as distinct and is often contrasted with the current
era, although, as I have argued, the earlier colonial viewpoint persists
and contributes to the crisis in the present. [Drawing in part from
Gender on Ice and Henson's later writings, Julien's work critiques
earlier Arctic representations]{.underline} such as Robert Flaherty's
Nanook of the North (1922), a signature film in which invidious
portraits of the Inuit community as backward and disappearing highlight
the Native's inability to adapt to Western progress.32 [Julien's film
resonates with its audiences because it responds to a larger visual
culture of the Arctic by exploring the relation between aesthetics and
politics]{.underline} as well as the Peary expedition's complex politics
of exclusion.33 Delving deeply into Henson's primary role in Peary's
expedition, [Julien is attracted to the inescapable rawness and violence
of the relationship between Henson and his employer.]{.underline} The
film situates Henson front and center, drawing the tensions between
Peary and Henson to the fore of the historical narrative, to question
the veracity of Peary's account of Henson's role. One of the most
powerful scenes in Julien's film retells the story of the expedition
from Henson's point of view, based on Henson's own account that he was
the first in Peary's party to reach the North Pole.34 Henson decided to
make it to the pole ahead of Peary after learning that Peary had
intended to exclude him from the final march to the pole. In [Gender on
Ice, I point out how Henson's retelling of this incident disturbs the
colonial discourse of that era, which portrays Blacks as irrational and
violent and whites as rational and well-tempered.]{.underline} Fearing
that Peary might kill him to keep this secret,35 Julien's film uses
Henson's own account written in 1966 as a voiceover to explain how he
ensured his own safety following Peary's initial violent outburst to
prevent it from escalating. The consequences for Henson of Peary's
betrayal were grave. According to his biographers, Henson did not
receive the national and international recognition he deserved, and at
the time of his death in 1955, he subsisted off a meager pension while
also working as a parking attendant in a Brooklyn warehouse.36 True
North takes poetic license and restructures Henson's story in unexpected
ways. It is a film about the North Pole but was filmed in Iceland and
northern Sweden[, which is made evident to the viewer through shots of
Iceland's ice caves. It focuses on descriptive reenactments but draws
from the documentary genre, historical documents, and nonfiction
material and, like most of Julien's films, is heavily research
based.]{.underline} Significantly, in Julien's film, we do not see Peary
or his rival, Frederick Cook, or [evidence of the bitter controversy
that ensued between the two American men who were both competing to be
the first to attain the North Pole at that historical moment. I. In lieu
of the driving anxiety and the competition in these white male
exploration narratives, Julien's film foregrounds the sheer physical
attraction of the North Pole, as well as the significance of the four
Inuit men --- Egingwah, Utah, Ooqeath, and Seegloo --- who accompanied
Peary and Henson (p]{.underline}late 12 and figures 2.12 and 2.15).37
Julien rewrites these older stories representing the four Inuit men and
Henson as witnesses to Peary's North Pole trek; in Julien's film, they
ultimately replace Peary as the narrative's focus.

#### An analytic of accumulation and fungibility is necessary to understand the "pathologization rubric" that sustains antiblack desires and racial logics of modernity and coloniality -- Only the affirmative can create Black futures that resonate with fugitive Blackness and their impermeant homes "within and outside the nation state"

Saidiya [Hartman]{.underline} (Reference Hartman1997:25--26) [extends
the theme of **Black fungibility, or commodified
interchangeability**]{.underline}, [into]{.underline} slavery
**[economies of affect, power, and pleasure]{.underline}**, noting that
'the figurative [capacities of blackness and]{.underline} the
[fungibility of the commodity are directly linked]{.underline}. The
[fungibility]{.underline} of the commodity, specifically its
abstractness and immateriality, [enabled the black body]{.underline}...
***[to serve as the vehicle of white self-exploration]{.underline}***,
[renunciation, and enjoyment'.]{.underline} Therefore, while Black flesh
constitutes a bare negation, its fungibility has evidenced a radical
symbolic potentiality, generating, for example, white subjectivities.
Similarly, Snorton (Reference Snorton2017:64) details how fungible
[Black flesh generated modernist/colonial sex and gender
categories]{.underline}, constituting a racialized interrelation that
has 'animat\[ed\] the semiotics of gender, wherein sex and gender became
inexhaustibly revisable according to the racial logic of consumption'.
Along these lines, Wynter (Reference Wynter, Hyatt and Nettleford1995)
explicates the [irruption of modernity/coloniality\'s hierarchical,
racializing classificatory schemes through the dialogical relation of
Man, or modernity/coloniality\'s genres of humanness]{.underline}
(white-male-bourgeoise-etc.), and **[Blackness positioned as the
liminal, sub/non-human category]{.underline}**. Making a general claim,
King (Reference King2019:23) contends that 'as a Black fleshy analytic
[**... Black fungibility can denote and connote pure flux, process, and
potential'**.]{.underline} As King observes, because Black fungibility
refers to flux and potentiality, it suggests an unpredictability that,
**[when scrutinized by the white gaze, inspires racial anxieties
regarding loss of control]{.underline}** which continue [to
motivate]{.underline} attempts to [capture Black life in material and
representational forms.]{.underline} These considerations are
characteristic of anti-Black racial logics of modernity/coloniality. On
one hand, [historical and contemporary conditions consistently attest to
the cultural (re)production of Blackness as a negated
alterity]{.underline}. On the other hand, [beyond laying the economic
foundations for modernity/coloniality, fungible Black flesh has provided
for the construction of white subjectivities]{.underline} (Hartman
Reference Hartman1997), the meanings of sex and gender categories
(Snorton Reference Snorton2017), racializing classificatory schemes
(Wynter Reference Wynter, Hyatt and Nettleford1995), and a host of other
core symbolic and discursive moments of modernity/coloniality. In other
words, [while Black life faces multiple, insatiable forms of
exploitation, it is also levied with an arrestingly hypocritical,
pathologizing rubric]{.underline} which, as Baldwin states in the
epigraph, is 'meant to define the other'. However, antimonies
surrounding Blackness also enable Black fugitivity. Faced with these
conditions, [Black life is often realized and survived in resistance,
flight, and disruption.]{.underline} Snorton (Reference Snorton2017:74)
elaborates an ontology of fungible fugitivity, wherein
'[blackness]{.underline} is that vestibularizing paradigm that **[is
both within and outside the nation-as-home',]{.underline}** [providing
Black people with 'loopholes of retreat' as impermanent
homes]{.underline}. While fugitivity literally denotes urgent escape
from captivity, it also refers to rich domains of discourse and
practic[e]{.underline} by which the carceral apprehension of the white
gaze and apparatuses of white supremacy are eluded. Motivated by
persistent racial anxieties, the specter of white incursion has entailed
how 'fungibility and fugitivity figured two sides of a Janus-faced coin'
(Snorton Reference Snorton2017:84), one which manifests as an affordance
for (re)imaginging Black futurity.

#### Our analytic forefronts antiblack violence but also provides the subtext for the construction of the Arctic as barren, uninhabited and thus prima sites for exploration and development - Black female bodies are the captive commodity that sustains settlement and dispossession in the US and Canada

[**In the Clearing examines the Black female figure as a trope for both
unfettered and impeded spatial expansion in the settler colonial states
of the U.S. and to some extent Canada.** I examine **the construction of
Black female bodies during slavery and after Emancipation.** I argue
that **Black female slave bodies are valuable to both the project of
settler colonial spatial expansion and slavery's production of fungible
forms of property**. Du**ring slavery they represent ever expanding
bodies and land. For example, during slavery the making of Black female
slaves facilitates the production of Settler space, the clearing of
Native land and the accumulation of property.** **The figure of the
Black female for the Settler functions as a metonym for unending
increase, expansion and malleability** (a kind of Hartmanian
fungibility) th**at enables the Settler to imagine land, property and
sexuality as spatial concepts that denote expansion and settlement**.
T**he Black female form in the New World appears as a metaphor for terra
nullius, the plantation** (or the planting of settlements), un**fettered
access to property, and the unending reproduction of bodies and land.
When the Settler surveys the Black female body, the Settler can imagine
their land, territory, property and spatial coordinates expanding. The
construction of the Black female slave body as fungible and a site of
accumulation is as much a product of the Settler's imagination as it is
the slave master'**s.33 **Black female bodies during slavery become
metaphors for unending increase in bodies, land and

the fungible slave, marks the Black female body a site where the

plantation) however, in slavery's afterlife34, **Black female bodies are
constructed and represented as impeding spatial expansion and
frustrating efforts to turn Black female flesh into
property**.]{.underline} Black female bodies are seen as reproducers of
surplus populations that get in the way of expansion and the
accumulation of capital. Off the plantation, Black female bodies must be
contained. These unruly and excessive---as opposed to
productive[**---Black female bodies that appear in my work do so as
tropes of disorganization, unfit mothers, a threat to the built

colonial landscapes beg for a new grammar in which to theorize the
presence of Black bodies in Settler colonial nation
states.**]{.underline} By using cultures and practices of everyday life
and the social production of space as modes of analysis, I am able to
theorize the ways that Black female bodies function as a location where
slavery (anti-Black racism) and settler colonialism meet. [Throughout
this project I repeatedly use the term, "the Black female body." At
times, I also refer to the "Black female slave body," and "Black female
bodies." Though the term, "the Black female body" and other derivates
may seem reductive and empty, I use the term to denote an open and
dynamic location where multiple meanings and associations are made,
remade and disassembled.35 However, when I am referring to agentive and
embodied subjects---including myself---I use the term Black woman or
women. As a sign, idea, symbol and representation, "the Black female
body" functions as a spatial trope throughout this project. **"The Black
female" form is an imagined space of unending possibility---or
useability---within the imaginaries of slavery and settler colonialism.
Its unending potential also contains a capacity for chaos and disorder,
particularly when Black women live outside of settler colonialism and
slavery's property making mandate. The Black female body as a spatial
trope has the potential for order or chaos.**]{.underline}

Earlier, Kane distanced himself from "the men" through
pseudoanthropological assumptions that the upper-class men were somehow
better able to cope with diseases. Furthermore, though he enjoyed the
theatre immensely, Kane continually reminded his readers that this
recreational activity was exclusively arranged by the lower decks so as
to create distance between himself and this occasionally gaudy pastime.
But on Christmas Day in 1850, Kane dropped these pretensions and, in
unity with the crew, fought the onset of depression by sharing in
alcohol, laughter and music. [The "negro songs" of Christmas Day were a
particularly potent cultural signifier around which the American men
could assemble. The segregated crew were able to eschew their class
divisions and cohere around the subjugated African-American, the
racially defined Other reminding the men that whatever their differences
in material possession and education, they enjoyed the presumption of
white identity]{.underline}.96 Though it is not known which songs were
sung that night, in Passed Midshipman Robert Randolph Carter's published
account of the expedition, he notes that they were: "Patriotic and
sentimental."97 As will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4[,
plantation songs made popular by Stephen Foster would resonate deeply
with the lower decks of polar expeditions for their depictions of
suffering but faithful slaves, providing a figurative language for the
sailors with which to describe and vent their own afflictions while
keeping racial hierarchies firmly in place]{.underline}. Here however,
it is sufficient to note that these "sentimental" songs would have no
doubt reminded the men of home. [That they chose racially offensive
songs about African-Americans as a means to conjure up nostalgic
feelings reads as particularly troubling: it suggests the
institutionalisation of black pain elicited a positive emotional
response, a yearning for the comforts and contours of systematised
racism while living in a liminal, frozen land where most known social
and environmental realities had been turned unreal by the dominating
environment]{.underline}. Worse yet, the men sang the songs on one of
the most important Christian days of the year, the story of the birth of
Jesus Christ and his mission of brotherhood and forgiveness not far from
their minds surely. This picture is complicated because these songs
were, in fact, attributed to black society by the whites that sung them.
[While their inherent racism may have made them comforting to the crew,
the very fact of their association with "blackness" suggests that
however repulsed by African-Americans they were, the men saw racially
defined Others as part of the make up of their national consciousness.
They turned the African-American Others into "symbolic figures that
could be rhetorically interior to the society they sought to
inaugurate."]{.underline}98 [These songs were, as stated, both
sentimental and patriotic -- they were regarded as a distinctly American
phenomenon. It is telling that after the singing of the minstrel songs,
the men went on to give a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the
national anthem and the "negro song" sitting side by side in a night of
nationalistic reverence.99]{.underline} [The expedition, ostensibly a
search-and-rescue mission, **created an enduring fascination and
colonial interest with the Arctic**. The heroic endeavours of the men
and their subsequent narrativisation by Kane helped construct new,
imperialist ideas of American nationhood both at home and in the Arctic.
But in these embryonic moments of geographic and symbolic expansion, the
men felt compelled to include commodified "black" cultural formations --
American flags planted to the soundtrack of slavery. Furthermore, at a
time when scurvy was decimating the men by forcing the reliving of
previous injury and pain, the nostalgic, sentimental spectre of the
suffering black body was conjured as a cultural assemblage around which
to gather.]{.underline} Perhaps [the projection of black corporeal
failings, brought on by the hands of whites, allowed the men to tap into
feelings of pain, to cathartically work through the diseases dismantling
their bodies]{.underline}. [But any moment of identification with black
pain was a one-way, conceited process, the sentimentalisation of
plantations and the sanitisation of their history precluding any
understanding of suffering. After the night of homesickness, songs and
laughter, the men continued to cheer their spirits, the minstrel songs
soon forgotten but their powerful effects still lingerin]{.underline}g.
"In fact, we were very happy fellows. We had had a foot-race in the
morning over the midnight ice for three purses of a flannel shirt each,
and a splicing of the main-brace. The day was night, the stars shining
feebly through the mist."100 To conclude, believing that the uneducated
would excite themselves with "imaginary terrors," Kane exposed the
harrowing introspection suffered by sailors while at the same time
pathologising it based on shipboard hierarchies, hierarchies shared in
common by British and American expeditions. The theatre, however, was an
altogether more democratic and occasionally gaudy affair, departing from
the British upper-class image of how drama should be produced and
performed. [The "negro songs" proved to be a fitting American
contribution to the canon of polar performance: through ridicule of the
black Other, the segregated crew was momentarily able to unify on
Christmas Day, the commodification of "black" culture so paramount to
white American identity that it was brought thousands of miles to Arctic
shores.]{.underline}

#### This irresistible desire to consume black flesh reflects the accumulation of antiblack violence and the means by which black bodies are rendered fungible-- The registers of gratuitous violence reveal a fetishisms, depravity and incalculable impact

**[When Black men do appear in Laaksonen's pieces, they're nearly always
an accessory to white desire.]{.underline}** One seared in my memory
depicts a white man being assaulted by four Black men. Another shows a
Black man being belt-whipped by two white men. As scholar Franklin
Howard explains, "[Tom sexualized potential police brutality and
visually represented the social imbalance of power in his erotic art.
**Black men cannot even pleasure each other without the presence of
white man."**]{.underline} A clear example that Howard cites is Tom's
Untitled (1988), [a drawing where two cops bend a Black man over the
hood of a police car while one prepares to penetrate him.]{.underline}
There's only [s**o much point to assigning ethics to erotica, but at the
same time, when compounded with the ongoing conversation on
state-sanctioned violence... yikes**]{.underline}**.** But the
[c**ommodification of Black fetishism among supposed "radicals" remains
timeless.** Both **Laaksonen and these protesters with sex-centered
signs place Blackness in a prop position while whiteness remains the
star.**]{.underline} Still, Laaksonen is no Robert Mapplethorpe, the
late, "edgy" homoerotic photographer. Mapplethorpe's faceless,
crotch-fixed photos of Black men in the 1980s are probably the best case
study for art that speaks to today's dick-crazed protest posters. His
1980 photograph "Man in Polyester Suit" is famously controversial for
its exposure of the Black subject's penis out of the fly of dress pants.
The piece has become the blueprint for shenanigans of this flavor.
Mapplethorpe went for it to the point that Milton Moore, the subject of
"Man in Polyester Suit" and many other photographs, is believed to have
once said he felt primitive beneath Mapplethorpe's gaze: **["I think he
saw me like a monkey in a zoo.]{.underline}"** [Sometimes I think that
my penis --- if magically granted autonomy to leap off my body and live
its own life --- might be valued more highly and by more people than my
entire being. **Black body parts are always profitable.** But once our
voices and brains get too involved, **attempts to edit or silence us are
never far off.** That's the simple truth for Black people enduring
racial capitalism.]{.underline}

#### And this scientific and scholarly fantasy to explore and develop posits circumpolar space as a "terra incognita" - This settler adventurism authorizes violent capture, occupation and erasure of indigenous peoples and sets the stage for an extraction and exploitation

We start with [scientists]{.underline}. Their [concepts and research
practices have accompanied efforts to conquer, cajole, civilize,
capitalize, consume, and conserve the far north since the late
1800s]{.underline}. It may feel odd for some readers to link the pursuit
of truths about the natural world with colonialism, especially in such a
sparsely populated zone. But [reflect for a moment on the most popular
chapter of Arctic history: the search for the North Pole. As historians
have deftly shown, American, Danish, and Norwegian explorers scoured the
Arctic Ocean at the turn of the twentieth century not simply to seek out
adventure but to find the world's remaining unclaimed
lands]{.underline}. [They returned south as national heroes because they
expanded their home country's territorial possessions]{.underline}.
[**Redrawing maps to display their discoveries**, they sprinkled the
names of sponsors on bays, islands, straits, and narrows. In these
material ways, **explorers extended Euro-American authority over the
Arctic**.]{.underline}3 [Like their maps, **explorers' tales about an
Arctic terra incognita and savage Inuit helped southerners claim the
north.**]{.underline} [With their words, they painted the Arctic as
isolated and inhospitable]{.underline}. At times, [they portrayed Inuit
communities as backward for relying on Stone Age technologies for
survival and primitive because they appeared to know neither religion
nor law]{.underline}. [In other instances, Inuit were
strong---superhuman, even---for subsisting in an environment without
trees, warmth, or readily accessible game]{.underline}. Historians
analyze these depictions of the Arctic in relation to when they were
produced and the dramas playing out at that time. [**Explorers'
narratives were products of metropolitan societies concerned with the
effects of overcivilization**, a softness emerging from the urban
existence that replaced life on the farm over the end of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}. [Those who consumed scientific ideas measured the
Arctic against the norms of the Euro-American experience, reifying that
experience as superior.]{.underline} [An exotic place, one uninfluenced
by machines and morality, then, was not an objective observation, but a
view through imperial eyes]{.underline}.4 The ways historians have
unpacked polar exploration illustrates the conceptual framework of this
book. That is, [**scientific representations of Arctic nature are
entangled with human interventions in the region**. A map of the North
Pole in 1909 was not an exact reproduction of the physical environment
of coastlines and ocean currents. Instead, it was a document born from
particular field experiences in particular places and widely held
desires for global dominance.]{.underline} Philosopher Ian Hacking puts
it this way: "Science is said to have two aims: theory and experiment.
Theories try to say how the world is. Experiment and subsequent
technology change the world. We represent and we intervene. We represent
in order to intervene, and we intervene in light of our
representations." Perhaps readers already understand this relationship
intuitively, given the adage "knowledge is power."[**5 Polar exploration
is just one example of the pursuit of knowledge converging with colonial
ambition in the Arctic.** Ideas of nature changed over time. New
paradigms pushed researchers to ask different questions about the north
just as human activity there altered the environment, requiring
continued analysis]{.underline}. I use the term scientist to refer to an
unwieldy group of people, from museum-based naturalists in the late
1800s to geophysicists working for military agencies during World War II
to ecologists translating research into political activism in the 1960s.
The differences among them are many, but what they share is this: at the
moment they appear in this book, they compete for the mantle on
definitive questions of scientific understanding, natural resource
management, and national development. In these ways, [the
nineteenth-century specimen collector inhabits a social and intellectual
space similar to the climate scientist today. By bringing these
practitioners together in this way, we thread diverse representations
and interventions in different historical periods in a line---thus
reconnecting the Arctic's colonial past with its present.6]{.underline}

[The issue of white male failure at the North Pole takes on another
meaning in Julien's work, since here failure is connected to the ways
late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century polar expeditions were
exclusively white and male undertakings]{.underline}, forging what I
called in [Gender on Ice "a discourse of nationalism, empire, and white
male heroism.]{.underline}"25 In contrast to the British, [the Americans
tried to produce a narrative of masculinity that was part of a
scientific tradition,]{.underline} which worked discursively to exclude
the significant presence of Inuit people and the participation of
Matthew Henson from the account. **[In the American narrative, there is
a larger emphasis on the actions of flesh-and-blood heroic
men.]{.underline} [Successful performance, athleticism, and scientific
achievement matter most]{.underline}.** While the tragedy of Scott's
failed expedition to the South Pole is acceptable within the parameters
of the literary, there is no place for failure within the ideological
narrative of scientific progress and athletic performance that framed
the discourses of Robert Peary's expedition.26 That is why the fact that
Henson was obliged literally to carry Peary back on his sledge from the
North Pole (because Peary had lost nine of his toes, which made it an
ordeal for him to wear snowshoes) was not made public by Henson until
1966, over forty years after Peary died.27 Even though Peary's
expedition was supposed to be scientific, his "faithful record" at the
North Pole was from the start contested and unstable and remains to this
day highly disputed and controversial.28 [This inability to acknowledge
outright the failure of the expedition, I argue, explains the
significance of Henson as the major corroborating witness and the narrow
focus of the critique of Peary, which has centered on establishing or
disputing the accuracy of his claim to have reached the
Pole.]{.underline} Therefore, the narrative of Scott's failed expedition
to the South Pole resonated more widely than that of the Peary
expedition's claim. Inspired by the events of the 1909 expedition to the
North Pole, Julien's True North (2004--2008) [**revisualizes the
Arctic,** taking on the competing stories of Peary's controversial
expedition, **which radically altered the lives of his longtime African
American exploration partner Matthew Henson and the Inuit men and women
of Ellesmere Island and northern Greenland** (figures 2.10 and
2.11).]{.underline}29 The title, True North, **[references how polar
exploration might have had a different meaning for Henson than for white
polar explorers at that time]{.underline}.** Robert Stepto has argued
that "[t**he seminal journey in Afro-American narrative literature is
unquestionably north,"**]{.underline} and one can see that Henson's
autobiography, A Black Explorer at the North Pole, **[extends the
geography of freedom mapped so often in the African American literary
tradition that dates back to the antebellum slave
narratives]{.underline}.**30 Though Henson was born to freed slaves, his
family was persecuted by the Ku Klux Klan, and he and his family
subsequently ended up in Washington, DC, to escape terror and
discrimination. But the long and dark history of slavery was not
entirely a matter of the past in the age of Jim Crow, even in the
nation's capital. Henson himself became an orphan by the age of twelve,
and before he started to work for Peary, he survived by going to sea as
a cabin boy; he traveled to ports as far away as China, Japan, Africa,
and the Russian Arctic seas to escape persecution. The film and
installation True North (2004--2008) is usually shown as a large-scale
multiple-screen audiovisual installation and offers one of the boldest
examples of the new departure in the artistic and scholarly discourse on
polar expedition narratives. [Like Aglert's work, True North brings us
back to the Heroic Age of exploration. During that period, many of the
Arctic regions had not yet achieved independent Indigenous
self-governance systems.]{.underline} That did not come until a century
later, as did Nunavut's independence in 1999 and Greenland's in 2008;
both continue to remain part of larger countries (Canada and Denmark,
respectively).31 In Euro-American histories of the Arctic, the heroic
era is often seen as distinct and is often contrasted with the current
era, although, as I have argued, the earlier colonial viewpoint persists
and contributes to the crisis in the present. [Drawing in part from
Gender on Ice and Henson's later writings, Julien's work critiques
earlier Arctic representations]{.underline} such as Robert Flaherty's
Nanook of the North (1922), a signature film in which invidious
portraits of the Inuit community as backward and disappearing highlight
the Native's inability to adapt to Western progress.32 [Julien's film
resonates with its audiences because it responds to a larger visual
culture of the Arctic by exploring the relation between aesthetics and
politics]{.underline} as well as the Peary expedition's complex politics
of exclusion.33 Delving deeply into Henson's primary role in Peary's
expedition, [Julien is attracted to the inescapable rawness and violence
of the relationship between Henson and his employer.]{.underline} The
film situates Henson front and center, drawing the tensions between
Peary and Henson to the fore of the historical narrative, to question
the veracity of Peary's account of Henson's role. One of the most
powerful scenes in Julien's film retells the story of the expedition
from Henson's point of view, based on Henson's own account that he was
the first in Peary's party to reach the North Pole.34 Henson decided to
make it to the pole ahead of Peary after learning that Peary had
intended to exclude him from the final march to the pole. In [Gender on
Ice, I point out how Henson's retelling of this incident disturbs the
colonial discourse of that era, which portrays Blacks as irrational and
violent and whites as rational and well-tempered.]{.underline} Fearing
that Peary might kill him to keep this secret,35 Julien's film uses
Henson's own account written in 1966 as a voiceover to explain how he
ensured his own safety following Peary's initial violent outburst to
prevent it from escalating. The consequences for Henson of Peary's
betrayal were grave. According to his biographers, Henson did not
receive the national and international recognition he deserved, and at
the time of his death in 1955, he subsisted off a meager pension while
also working as a parking attendant in a Brooklyn warehouse.36 True
North takes poetic license and restructures Henson's story in unexpected
ways. It is a film about the North Pole but was filmed in Iceland and
northern Sweden[, which is made evident to the viewer through shots of
Iceland's ice caves. It focuses on descriptive reenactments but draws
from the documentary genre, historical documents, and nonfiction
material and, like most of Julien's films, is heavily research
based.]{.underline} Significantly, in Julien's film, we do not see Peary
or his rival, Frederick Cook, or [evidence of the bitter controversy
that ensued between the two American men who were both competing to be
the first to attain the North Pole at that historical moment. I. In lieu
of the driving anxiety and the competition in these white male
exploration narratives, Julien's film foregrounds the sheer physical
attraction of the North Pole, as well as the significance of the four
Inuit men --- Egingwah, Utah, Ooqeath, and Seegloo --- who accompanied
Peary and Henson (p]{.underline}late 12 and figures 2.12 and 2.15).37
Julien rewrites these older stories representing the four Inuit men and
Henson as witnesses to Peary's North Pole trek; in Julien's film, they
ultimately replace Peary as the narrative's focus.

Other than shared geological histories, Africa and Antarctica are
perhaps most intimately connected via weather. The Capetonian drought
with which I started was marked by weather maps showing how seasonal
storms bringing rain from the Southern Ocean were dissipating before
striking the coast, a vivid reminder of oceanic-climatic links.
Historically, South [Africa's concern with Antarctica was motivated by
weather, a point of intense concern for the white state's
agriculturall]{.underline}y based electorate (van der Watt & Swart,
2015). Even more so, swiftly progressing [climate change calls for
creative (re)readings of both canonical and speculative African
narratives of rain, drought, cyclones and rising seas as linked to
Antarctica-derived weather patterns]{.underline}. Set on the same
stretch of coast as The Whale Caller, "somewhere after Hermanus and
before the Eastern Cape," Mohale Mashigo's short story "Floating Rugs"
(2019) describes a related set of submarine connections between the two
continents, although directed towards the future rather than the past.
The story is told by a young woman who lives beneath the waves of the
Cape shoreline, part of a secret community who draws on their knowledge
of the sea gained through ancestral "poaching" to become what the
narrator ironically calls a ["lost conservation tribe" engaged in marine
stewardship. In this story, set in the near future after the "snow
faraway \[has\] melted," seaside holiday homes that had been abandoned
due to sea level rise are turned into an underwater resort, only to be
abandoned again to become the ramshackle submarine homes of the former
fishers and poachers.]{.underline} As in Mda's novel, Antarctic
migratory whales interact with the protagonist, but here the
interspecies divide is further narrowed by [a shared ecological
vulnerability and submarine oceanic home.]{.underline} 348 C. Lavery
[This wet future is the climate-changed flip side of the planetary
drought]{.underline} depicted in Wanuri Kahiu's well-known short film,
Pumzi. In the film, set "35 years after World War III -- 'The Water
War'" in "Maitu Community, East African Territory," the few remaining
survivors are confined to high-tech bunkers where even sweat is mopped
up and recycled as precious drinking water. The film [explicitly links
the catastrophic drought of the future to present climate change by, in
the first seconds of the film, panning across framed newspaper headlines
announcing rising global temperatures and melting Antarctic
ice.]{.underline} Unusually, it also depicts the technological
[innovation required for survival as coming from the African continent
rather than outside]{.underline} (for a longer discussion, see Pereira
et al., 2020). Other stories depict sea-risen cities from further
afield, like a sunken Lagos in "The Last Lagosian" by Wole Talabi
(2016), or [narrate sudden changes in climate, such as "A Winter in
Lagos"]{.underline} by Saratu Abiola (2014), which depicts the formerly
tropical city as snow-bound in arctic conditions. While [this new
speculative strand of African futurist fiction has rich potential for
transcontinental literary exploration, more canonical or realist fiction
can also be reread for weather and environmental change]{.underline}
(one thinks of Charles Mungoshi's Waiting for the Rain (1975), for
example). Linking both of these, Zambian epic novel The Old Drift by
Namwali Serpell (2019) situates rivers, dams and water at the centre of
its narrative, in a productively historical-speculative mode that links
dam-building of the colonial past to the dambusting of a drought-ridden
future. Conclusion: decolonising [the African Antarctic Imagination
Exploring the imaginative relationship between Antarctica and Africa is
part of a wider call to imagine a postcolonial Antarctic, or to
decolonise Antarctic science, history and art (]{.underline}Dodds, 2006;
Dodds & Collis, 2017; Howkins, 2010; Scott, 2017). The Antarctic Treaty
is by no means devoid of colonial and racial hierarchies. But Antarctica
is nevertheless becoming more central to the earth's and particularly
Africa's future in a time of planetary change (Leane & McGee, 2019).
[Ongoing and growing entanglements with Antarctica provide rich cultural
possibilities, and urgent motivation, for imagining alternate Antarctic

#### Henson's legacy was rendered obscure by the State, even though he was the most important member of the Polar Expedition. It wasn't until the final year of his life where he was awarded even the slightest recognition.

Henson died in New York in 1955, at eighty-eight years old. His funeral
at New York's Abyssinian Baptist Church was attended by more than 1,000
friends and admirers. [Over the years, a number of distinguished
Americans had attempted to procure what Henson's wife Lucy had once
called "proper and deserved recognition" for this proud black man who
was born in Charles County, Maryland, three years after the abolition of
slavery, but he died relatively obscure outside the black community. In
1931, U.S. Navy Admiral Donald B. MacMillan, a native of Massachusetts
who had been a member of the 1909 North Pole expedition, asked Congress
to create an award for Henson]{.underline}. In a letter to Congress,
MacMillan wrote: "In consideration of the very valuable work of Matthew
A. Henson, assistant to Peary for eighteen years (1891-1909), I would
suggest a special medal to be awarded by Congress[. Henson went to the
Pole with Peary because he was a better man than any man in Peary's
party. In fact, he was of more value to Commander Peary on the Polar Sea
than all white men combined. ... Race, creed, or color should not stand
in the way of recognition."Henson did not receive recognition from
Congress at that time. In fact, one **Congressman indicated his
unwillingness to "introduce the name of a Negro on the House
floor."**]{.underline}Throughout the 1940s and '50s, leaders in the
African-American community, and some whites such as MacMillan and
Admiral Eugene McDonald of the Chicago Geographic Society, continued to
seek recognition for Henson's contributions to Arctic exploration. [On
April 6, 1954, nearly half a century after he planted an American flag
in the icepack at the Pole and the year before his death, Matthew and
Lucy Ross Henson were honored with an invitation to the White House,
where they were welcomed by President Dwight David
Eisenhower.]{.underline}

#### Henson was expected to use his skills and knowledge with no reward or credit -- this is indicative of normative antiblack sentiment in the Arctic, hidden and translated into typical "exploration" and "development" rhetoric

In 1912, however, [Henson had to fight with words for
recognition]{.underline}. While most Henson scholarship has focused on
Henson's contribution to Artic exploration, two articles deal more
closely with his autobiographical endeavors. In "Matthew Henson and the
Antinomies of Racial Uplift" (2012) Anthony S. [Foy links Henson's
"discourse of work, merit and recognition" (21) to Booker T.
Washington's ideas of racial uplift, which proved inadequate for the
complexities of race and citizenship in the world Henson
inhabited]{.underline}, also outside US borders. In '"To Return and Tell
the Tale of the Doing': Matthew Henson and the African American
Explorer's Identity" (2015), [Gary Totten analyzes the genre
fluctuations in Henson's memoir between the travel narrative and the
slave narrative.]{.underline} The present article details the
tribulations of Commander Robert E. Peary's skilled assistant and draws
attention to his complicated racial position as a member of the 1908-09
North Pole expedition, as well as its erasure of Inughuit identity and
expertise.2 Henson's 2 "Inughuit" indicates the Polar population of
north-western Greenland. The terms of primary and secondary materials,
which mostly use the terms "Eskimo," "Esquimo" or "Inuit," have been
retained in quotations.[memoir demonstrates the skills with which he
constructs himself as a writer and an explorer in a group of white,
Arctic travelers, who often demanded not just his talents, but also his
invisibility, loyalty, and silence.]{.underline}

[It seems odd that after such a long and successful partnership the two
men would become estranged from one another.]{.underline} With a
difference of a few hours at most it would be reasonable to give Peary
and Henson equal credit for having reached the North Pole together as a
team. [But the racially divisive climate of time would not give an
African-American man the same standing in the public eye for the
accomplishment of such a monumental feat of human
achievement.]{.underline} [Peary was the recognized discoverer of the
Pole while Henson was relegated to the role of trusty
companion.]{.underline} [Despite Henson's indispensable contributions to
their efforts for almost 20 years he received very little
acknowledgment.]{.underline} Matters only got worse when even Peary's
claim of success was called into question. A member of a previous
Greenland expedition, a man by the name of Frederick Cook, professed to
have reached the North Pole one year earlier on April 21, 1908. But the
controversy quickly faded when several individuals came forward with
compelling evidence to dispute Cook's contrived story of discovery.
Unfortunately many doubts were raised to suggest that Peary had also
failed to reach the North Pole. Several skeptics speculated that he
missed the mark by several hundred miles. With few ways to verify the
success of this kind of remote expedition reports of a successful
outcome were made on the honor system. Really [the only other person to
back up Peary's story was Henson]{.underline}, as the four Inuit hunters
didn't speak English. [Though as a black man his testimony was likely
deemed by many to be less than credible the strength of his character as
substantiated other members of the party carried a great deal of weight
in affirming the truth of their journey to the top of the
globe.]{.underline}

### Afrofuturism -- Hope Add on

#### Afro-futurist imaginaries and story-telling create hope that gives autonomy to black communities 

**Park 15.** Jason Park. Nov 23, 2015. "Afrofuturism: A Movement of
Rebellion". Rutgers University. // mars

[**Afrofuturism is a bright hope for a better future,** bec**ause it
allows people of color to see beyond the systems of oppression that bind
them.**]{.underline} **I[magining a new future is crucial because it
expands imaginations and allows Black communities to envision a new,
better society.]{.underline}** William Bainbridge, the author of "Women
in Science Fiction," states that [Afrofuturism "has become a forum for
women authors']{.underline} uninhibited public analysis of contemporary
sex roles and consideration of options for the future" (Bainbridge
1081). Bainbridge recognizes how [Afrofuturism gives African Americans
**the power to use their imagination, as exemplified with authors such
as Octavia Butler. Barbara Hilton,**]{.underline} the author of
"Afrofuturism - Language of Rebellion," uses an excellent quote from her
interview with Ytasha Womack: [T**alking about the future fundamentally
changes you.** It transforms the present. It expands your imagination
and you start to imagine new societal scenarios..]{.underline}. [**The
power of imagination creates hope and reminds you that society isn't
permanent,** but always in flux]{.underline}: that you, as a person,
possess the drive and the power to influence society\... But [for many
black-bodied people that means they have to push past the idea that they
don't think they have any influence on their own future]{.underline}
(Hilton). **Womack excellently identifies [the power of imagination for
Black bodies]{.underline}** [who have been told throughout history that
they cannot be anything more than their status of slavery. **By
imagining a better future, Black people can advocate and fight for
change.**]{.underline} [**This completely shifts the future that White
men have laid out for Black people under Western culture. White men have
forced the Black community into believing that they are inferior and
have predicted them to fail.** Under Afrofuturism howeve**r, Black
people are able to simultaneously bring attention to issues that are
important to them and also reclaim their identity. It takes traditional
tropes and stereotypes and turns it on its head.**]{.underline} Black
people, through science fiction, are whatever protagonists they imagine
themselves to be. To display the effectiveness of Afrofuturism, Nalo
Hopkinson uses Afrofuturistic themes in her work. In her short story "A
Habit of Waste", main character [Cynthia, is able to leave and take
control of new bodies as if she is putting on a new pair of
clothes.]{.underline} According to Faucheux, a journalist who provides a
case study on A Habit of Waste, she states that: In the story, [**the
decentralization of the body as a stable signifier of identity is a
profoundly queer rhetorical move;** the subject's race, gender, and
sexuality become entirely irrelevant precisely because **the body is no
longer an inescapable prison of flesh.**]{.underline} [Thus "A Habit of
Waste" illustrates queer Afrofuturism's potential to reveal the
absurdities of the hold social constructions have on the
body]{.underline} (Faucheux 573). Faucheux reveals that Cynthia's
supernatural ability to change bodies was a tool that Hopkinson used in
order to empower African Americans to believe that they are able to
define their identity however they want. This is a powerful tactic
Hopkinson uses that reminds African Americans that under Afrofuturism[,
**their future is not defined by the typical narrative that White men
have created.**]{.underline} Just like Cynthia, African Americans are no
longer prisoners under the control of the way the dominant hegemony
gives people their identity. Cynthia, [who represents **the liberty of
expression, gives African Americans autonomy in determining their own
future.**]{.underline}

### Afrofuturism -- Resistance/Freedom

#### Afrofuturist tools can be used to defy anti-black hegemony -- that carves out spaces of freedom. 

**Park 15.** Jason Park. Nov 23, 2015. "Afrofuturism: A Movement of
Rebellion". Rutgers University. // mars

[**African Americans must challenge history** which was created by the
White ruling class]{.underline}. Throughout history, [African Americans
were told that their voices and their lives do not matter. **There is an
inherent conflict between what society and history define someone as,
and who one understands themselves to be.**]{.underline} Therefore,
[**Afrofuturism is important because it allows the Black community to
tell their own story and declare their existence outside of the
definition which White males placed on them.** Kindred, by Octavia
Butler, is an excellent example of how Afrofuturism reconciles the past
with the present.]{.underline} According to Philip Miletic, a journalist
who provides a case study on Kindred, ["**The unexplained mechanism of
time travel that Butler utilizes in Kindred is an Afrofuturist tool that
further challenges this notion of "blowing away**]{.underline}" the 228
past" (Miletic 266) This tactic of time travel that Miletic elaborates
on is crucial for two reasons. First[, **it recognizes that slavery is
the foundation of Black oppression.** Second, by time travelling out of
the past, **it gives Black audiences the understanding that they are not
bound by their past**. **Through Afrofuturism, slavery is no longer a
definitive narrative allows African Americans to declare that they exist
outside of their cultural subjugation to White men.**]{.underline}
Ultimately, t[his **freedom that Butler explores in Kindred allows
audiences "to carve out a space through literacy\... for all Black women
as well, an otherwise male-dominated practice and form of
liberation"**]{.underline} (Miletic 264). [This new-found liberation
also allows Black bodies, a]{.underline}ccording to journalists like
Susana Morris, [to "\[examine\] the current problems faced by blacks and
people of color more generally and \[critique\] interpretations of the
past" (]{.underline}Morris 153). [**This freedom is a formidable tool
because it challenges the dominant hegemony** which has distorted the
past of oppressed groups and disabled them from utilizing their voices.
**It also gives African Americans the creative space to express
themselves however they wan**t. Therefore, **through Afrofuturism, power
is restored and placed back into the hands of the Black community who
have a new-found freedom.**]{.underline}

[**What I appreciate about science fiction is how it inspires questions
about society's progress and the human ability to
intervene.**]{.underline} Twenty years from now, **[will we still mourn
Breonna Taylor]{.underline}? [Are we doomed to cyclical
behavior?]{.underline}** [**Will race relations in this country ever
change?** One strand of science fiction that helps me process these
types of questions is Afrofuturism. **Afrofuturism is a cultural
philosophy expressed through literature, fashion, music, technology, and
activism that uses Black diaspora cosmologies to imagine alternative
futures for people of color**.]{.underline} Cultural critic Kodwo Eshun
warns that [t**he future has already been commoditized based on
mathematical and economic models that may not take into account the
cultural memory and needs of Black and Indigenous
peoples**.]{.underline}1 [**Afrofuturism intervenes** into these future
projections through a counter-imagination.]{.underline} Moor Mother,
another theorist, argues that **[when Black people and people of color
more generally, synthesize lessons and helpful values from the
non-Western past, they develop more strategic and creative planning, and
become empowered to re-envision our current moment: "The hopes and
dreams of our ancestors act as important metaphysical tools that serve
as agents to help one discover hidden information in the present
time.]{.underline}**"2 This reasoning implies [**there's a benefit to
embracing simultaneity,** as disjointed as it may feel, because each
time-event holds the potential of previously embedded wisdom.
**Afrofuturism injects hope into mainstream science fiction's dystopia
without disregarding that life is hard and the future can be
frightening.** In the collection Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction
Stories from Social Justice Movements,]{.underline} named for the
incomparable sci-fi author [Octavia Butler and which incidentally opens
with a story about the racial fallout of an epidemi]{.underline}c,
writer [Alexis Pauline Gumbs responds to the thrust of Afrofuturism in a
piece depicting an archive of saved emails in which a 12 year old writes
to her ancestor of five generations past:]{.underline} \"Ancestor
Alexis\... last year I did a project for our community about your time,
[**the time of silence breaking\...**People broke a lot of things other
than silence during your lifetime.]{.underline} And [**people learned
how to grow new things and in new ways.**]{.underline} Now **[we are
very good at growing\...everyone is supportive of growing time, which
includes daydreams, deep breaths, and quiet walks..]{.underline}.**It
seems like people are growing all the time in different ways. It was
great to learn about you and a time when whole communities decided to
grow past silence.\"3 I find this passage hopeful because, although it
appears change may take decades, the character alludes to one of the
coronavirus pandemic's [most important reminders, in my opinion---that
**painful realities can be offset by growth**. **The ancestors in
Gumbs\' story intentionally push past the danger of silence and accept
that the discomfort of resistance might characterize their
time**]{.underline}**.** In this passage, and elsewhere in the
narrative, [Gumbs also suggests **alternative uses of time: dreaming,
reflecting, breathing, and dancing. Combining struggle with
contemplation and celebration is an Afrofuturist value.**]{.underline}
My aim here, however, is not to suggest that the work of \"silence
breaking,\" which I would call social justice, is simply a matter of
reflection or cheer. Rather, I am arguing tha[t **reckoning with the
present and leveling the experiential field of time requires creative
tools,** such as the lens of Afrofuturism.]{.underline} In classes
focused on this literature, for example, s[tudents discuss the multiple
meanings of \"taking one\'s time,\"]{.underline} how in one context it
valorizes an intentionally slower pace and in another, i[t can mean
**seizing an opportunity to guarantee redress no matter how long it
takes.** In a science fiction, imaginary, just as in real life,
catastrophic events happen.]{.underline} Things break. Divides are
revealed[. But **to reflect on time is to move towards change, and with
change comes the potential for hope.**]{.underline}

### Imagining - Black Arctic

#### The arctic exists non-linearly as a template for articulating the middle passages \-- Afrofuturist works like "the black arctic" broadly tear the racialized logics of "Zorg".

\[answer Alexaner Cromer\] 'Yes. I wanted to depart from, but also
complicate, Sharpe's book. Blackness resides in the wake of the Middle
Passage, Sharpe argues, which is in the Atlantic Ocean. We know that
**[the Arctic has a nonlinear relationship with the Atlantic. And as we
see from climate change, it has the ability to disrupt its mechanisms.
Its glacial ice function as an archive of earth memory, and its
temperatures affect the flow of the Atlantic. I wondered: could the
Arctic potentially also disrupt the Middle Passage? That is how The
Black Arctic came about.']{.underline}** 'It is **[a fictional alternate
universe,]{.underline}** where [**Black people are in Greenland and the
Arctic.** There was **a slave ship called "Zorg" that got lost at sea
during the slave trade. The captain decided to get rid of some of the
cargo**, which were enslaved people, by throwing them
overboard.]{.underline} [**The Black Arctic is based on that story, and
how those people drifted upwards to the Arctic to start this fictional
society**.]{.underline} It's also [remotely related to this idea of
Black Atlantis,]{.underline} which is under the same premise but instead
of drifting to land, enslaved people started a civilization underwater.
Lupe Fiasco's *Drogas Wave* is a pretty cool reference for this, as that
whole music album is about Black Atlantis[. The Black Arctic became a
container for a lot of my work that looked into death, and specifically
Black death]{.underline}. [I became particularly interested in **this
notion of reclaiming death. Throughout the history of the United States,
we couldn't even have our own deaths, as they were taken from us during
police-involved shootings. These deaths were taken from us, proliferated
on the internet and became accessible for the whole world. The Black
Arctic became a way of reclaiming death, and a way of finding some kind
of ancestral home.'**]{.underline}

#### Black lives living throughout and within the Atlantic Ocean become part of a historical narrative of the Earth\'s glacial memory \-\-- Black Afro-Diasporic narratives create forms of connections throughout the Atlantic Ocean as a political form of restitution.

**The Middle Passage refers to the second of three sea voyages that made
up the triangular chattel slave trade** used between the 15th and 19th
centuries. **[It stretches over the North Atlantic ocean and was used to
ferry souls from Africa to the New World.]{.underline}** [T**he route
marks the beginning of the Afro/diaspora and the subsequent, violent
legacy of anti-black racism in the Americas.**]{.underline} It also
represents something more than that - [the subjugation of a
more-than-human object via processes of white supremacist
domination.]{.underline} In this sense, **[both Black lives and the
North Atlantic have become entangled within the memory of the Middle
Passage, which is both catalyst for and symbol of that entanglement. In
constant interchange with the North Atlantic ocean is the
Arctic.]{.underline}** [T**he compacted glacial ice of the Arctic serves
as an archive of Earth's memory, cataloging records of atmospheric
conditions with each new layer formed.** Its extreme temperatures affect
the flow of the North Atlantic, in turn contributing to global climate
maintenance. **The Arctic and the North Atlantic work in tandem, two
more-than-human objects in a mutually dependent ecological waltz. Since
these two phenomena are interrelated is it also possible that the Arctic
has a relationship with the Middle Passage? How can this relationship be
used to uncover Afro/diasporic narratives that counter colonial and
pro-white narratives?**]{.underline} **[And can this relationship
perhaps be used to create temporally indefinite arenas of healing and
trauma recovery?]{.underline} T[he research project investigates the
potentiality of this interrelation by proposing a fictional world that
exists within the relationship itself.]{.underline}** [It wants to
channel **a performative storytelling practice through an afrofuturist
lens to reimagine the limited history of the Afro/diaspora.** In doing
so**, this research aims to recontextualize the Middle Passage to create
new, transformative spaces of healing within the entanglement of Black
lives and the North Atlantic.**]{.underline}

This is an extract from a script that accompanies sounds and images that
I have been collecting for an ongoing live audio-visual essay called
Black Atlantis.1 **[Black Atlantis looks at the Black Atlantic and its
afterlives in contemporary illegalized migration at sea, in oceanic
environments, through Afrofuturistic dancefloors, and soundsystems and
in outer space]{.underline}.** Using Walter Benjamin's concept of the
dialectical image I examine how to think through [sound, image, water,
violence, and history as elements of an active archive]{.underline}; and
the late twentieth century electronic music duo from Detroit, Drexciya's
framework of time travel as an historical method. (A majority of these
elements are presented in unlikely pairs, juxtaposed with one another).
[**Black Atlantis combines two discourses: Afrofuturism and the
Anthropocene**.]{.underline} This follows Phil Sternberg's critique of
the original formulation of the Black Atlantic, which he points out
focuses on surfaces rather than depths of the ocean (Sternberg 2015:
n.p.). As a result, the wetness of the ocean is lost and thus its
haptic, tactile quality is lost. [This script takes Drexciya and their
creation of a sonic, fictional world as a point of
departure.]{.underline} Through liner notes and track titles, [they take
the Black Atlantic below the water with their imaginary of an Atlantis
comprised of former slaves who have adapted to living
underwater.]{.underline} **[The leap to Drexciya would be at once into
the past and towards a sci-fi future]{.underline}. The pendulum swings,
time bifurcates, and the image flickers.** What wetness brings back to
the table is a sense of the haptic, the sensory, the bodily, and the
epidermal. [What below-the-water, and Atlantis brings back is the bottom
of the sea, the volume of the water, the materiality of the space of the
ocean, and other protagonists that inhabit the sea]{.underline}. In
1840, J. M. W. Turner painted Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and
Dying, Typhoon Coming On. The sky is red and purple and gold and blue
which shifts to frothy white. In the white a ship's masts faintly
recede. The water is brown. In the right hand corner is a leg with a
manacle round the ankle. There is perhaps a shadow of an arm but it is
hard to tell as in the water around it are the ghostly maws of fish with
puckered mouths and dark eyes, and seagulls diving into the water. [In
1781, the crew of the English slave ship Zong threw their slaves
overboard in a calculus that determined that the insurance money for
their death was worth more than the profit gained from selling their
lives.]{.underline} As ships crossed the Atlantic, it was a common
practice for the captain and crew to jettison cargo in storms, but in a
few instances such as on the Zong, it was slaves who were thrown
overboard -- [an action that raised the issue of whether slaves were
legally defined as people or property, and what constituted an
unforeseeable event: what in insurance terms would be defined as an "act
of God."]{.underline} **[This was an ambivalence that played out in
insurance claims in court, in art and literature, in the fuelling of the
abolitionist movement, through a cast of characters that included the
weather, slaves on boats, and the boats themselves.]{.underline}** In
any account of the slave ship Zong, Turner's Slavers is the image that
accompanies it. But as the Atlantic historian James Walvin points out,
in fact this is not the Zong (2011: 1-11). [There is no image of the
Zong, nor was there a storm at sea that precipitated the
massacre]{.underline}. Be that as it may this painting is the stand-in
for the Zong massacre which has no image and happened on still waters.
[In this storm the water, the limbs of slaves, the mouths of hungry
fish, and the gawping birds become the ecology of the brown water of the
sea.]{.underline} I keep returning to the fact that there was no
typhoon, that [the storm is an imagined one that has become appended to
the lore of the slave ship Zong]{.underline}. How was it possible to
append a storm to the massacre aboard the Zong? Or in other words, what
is it about storms and what does it mean to imagine one onto history?
[Storms become a point of entry to think about how nature in flux is
invoked in a sociohistorical inquiry that takes into account the ways in
which seascapes are inveigled into the unstable designation of slaves as
persons or property in the triangular trade.]{.underline} Which
strangely enough leads to an electronic band from Detroit called
Drexciya whose mythos, built through liner notes, describe [a story
where the children born of pregnant slaves thrown overboard were able to
adapt to living underwater as they went straight from living in amniotic
fluid to ocean water, and so built a Black Atlantis called
Drexciya.]{.underline} During the greatest holocaust the world has ever
known, pregnant America-bound African slaves were thrown overboard by
the thousands during labour for being sick and disruptive cargo. Is it
possible that they could have given birth at sea to babies that never
needed air? Are Drexciyans water-breathing aquatically mutated
descendants of those unfortunate victims of human greed? Recent
experiments have shown a premature human infant saved from certain death
by breathing liquid oxygen through its underdeveloped lungs (Drexciya,
1997: n.p.). [A key aspect of the Drexciya myth is its temporal
proposition: to see time and history as equally in flux as the lapping
ocean, to see the afterlife of the middle passage in a futuristic
scenario.]{.underline}

#### Blackness is interpreted through the boundlessness of sonics, arising in spaces that allow it to flourish, create, explore, and enjoy -- through this, the Black Atlantis is both created and transformed.

Seafloors" In *Night Shifters* (pp. 44--53). essay, Berlin, GE:

In his still scene-setting essay on the birth of techno in Detroit, [Ben
Williams describes techno as]{.underline} [rooted in an African American
industrial condition: the collapse in the 1980s of inner cities, and the
decay of the automobile industry.]{.underline}1 Techno was the
soundtrack of industrial decay, narrated and predicted by William Gibson
and Alvin Toffler amongst others. Although the pioneers of techno came
from the suburbs, the scene was set in the abandoned city centre, in
towering hulks of abandoned automobile factories where the first labels
made their offices. This is where the parties happened. [The spaces of
former daytime industry became spaces of nighttime congregation. Techno
took on the sound of the machines that once operated in these spaces --
replicating the sounds and affects of the robots that had taken and made
obsolete the jobs of human workers that they had replaced. This sound
enters the bodies of the nighttime ravers and conditioned bodies to move
in its wake.]{.underline} Drexciya, a late 20th century project helmed
by Gerald Donald and James Stinson, entered this scene with the same
secrecy and mystery as other techno outfits, producing analogue sounds
that moved away from the 4/4 standard. Instead of creating a cult of
personality, they kept their own identities a mystery. [Drexciya
introduced another mythology through multiple liner notes, track titles
and album covers: the creation of an eponymous underwater city built by
slaves thrown overboard ships sailing across the Atlantic to plantations
in the Americas. The sonic fiction of Drexciya describes how pregnant
enslaved women's fetuses adapted to living underwater by moving straight
from amniotic liquid to oceanic water. The sound of Drexciya reflects
this darkness. The sound is aquatic and submarine and heavy and dark and
warm. **The dancefloor, enshrouded in darkness and flickering light,
becomes a seafloor, populated with bodies. The dancefloor is the night's
answer to the death of the inner city**]{.underline}. Its cadences
calibrate a new set of gestures that, rather than refuse the gestures
used in these spaces before, make them kinetic and anomic on the crowded
dancefloor. [To this Drexciya adds the dimension of the ocean floor and
the aftermath of a history of far more violent annihilation. The ocean
floor interpenetrates the dancefloor, becomes another dimension to exist
in the darkness of the night, and the production of another logic of
movement that is fuelled by the gestures of the daytime whose traces
still exist in these hollowed out spaces.]{.underline} This is an
experiment of thinking about Drexciya as a sonic and spatial method2 --
to think through the interpenetration of one space by another where the
second space is not merely a metaphor but rather a tangible presence
that enervates and enters the moving body and fuels a set of movements
from within. Two histories become intertwined in the bodies on the
dancefloor in Detroit, two sets of spaces become the motors of one
another. Darkness also then becomes multivalenced: in the darkness of
the dancefloor the production of another kind of darkness becomes
tangible: that of slavery, its epidermal figuration of darkness. The
genesis of this other darkness is in the hold of the slaveship. The
conditioning of darkness and movement becomes what Williams would called
a 'secret code' that carries its imperative into rhythms of the day that
follows the night - of syncopated and synthesised movement, of the
dancefloor and of the sea floor. The darkness of the night becomes a
method that infiltrates the cadences of the day. Ship/The Hold/The

SINGING"3) This is Fred Moten reading "I Wish for Other Singing" from I
ran from it and was still in it. I see this poem as alluding to another
state of indeterminacy on the ship, between bodies: the transmutation of
collective bodies through sound. There is a set of sonics that comes out
of this shared experience of dehumanization of labour that has its birth
in the hold of the slaveship that Stefano Harney and Fred Moten describe
as haptic. They say: [Never being on the right side of the Atlantic is
an unsettled feeling, the feeling of a thing that unsettles with others.
To have been shipped is to have been moved by others, with others.... In
the hold\... another kind of feeling became common. This form of feeling
was not collective, not given to decision, not adhering or reattaching
to settlement, nation, state, territory or historical story; nor was it
repossessed by the group, which could not now feel as one, reunified in
time and space.]{.underline} No, when Black Shadow sings ["are you
feelin' the feelin]{.underline}?'' he is asking about something else.
[He is asking about a way of feeling through others, a feel for feeling
others feeling you. This is modernity's insurgent feel, its inherited
caress, its skin talk, tongue touch, breath speech, hand laugh. This is
the feel we might call hapticality.... Hapticality, the touch of the
undercommons, the interiority of sentiment, the feel that what is to
come is here. Hapticality, the capacity to feel though others, for
others to feel through you, for you to feel them feeling you, this feel
of the shipped is not regulated,]{.underline} at least not successfully,
by a state, a religion, a people, an empire, a piece of land, a totem.
[Or perhaps we could say these are now recomposed in the wake of the
shipped.]{.underline} Refused these things, we first refuse them, in the
contained, amongst the contained, lying together in the ship, the
boxcar, the prison, the hostel. Skin, against epidermalisation, senses
touching... Though forced to touch and be touched, to sense and be
sensed in that space of no space, though refused sentiment, history and
home, we feel (for) each other\... ['Feelin the feelin' is a point of
entry to understand the incomprehensible, how music and voice become
vehicles of this haptic experience of being on board a slave
ship.]{.underline} This is before a sense of collectivity can be formed,
before a language, articulated can be formed contra the state. It's a
sense of a something else that arises viscerally, beyond language's
intelligibility[. Its radicality plays out sonically but also as he
states at the level of the skin]{.underline} -- the pharmakonic surface
that is created in the unnameable experience in the hold but also in the
sense of touch that becomes the beginning of what Harney and Moten call
an insurgency. [This haptic experience is synesthetic -- pulling the
sense of touch together with the sense of song.]{.underline} Skin and
voice are the sites of contestation and agency. They are literally at
the border between techne and body. And its hapticality comes into being
in the machine of the hold. Its afterlife Harney and Moten state comes
into the continued experience of slavery on plantations and in prisons.5
Its song continues in the form of work songs and songs on the chain
gang. These are soundtracks to work; they pace the gestures of
indentured work in the afterlife in the hold. I want to turn to the
recording of the songs on a prison chain gang as --problematically or
not -- recorded by Pete Seeger. In Wake Up Dead Man,6 the folklorist
Bruce Jackson describes his 1966 trip with Pete Seeger and his family to
a prison in Texas to record the chain gang singing by inmates in the
Ellis Unit. The area near the prison along the Trinity and Brazos rivers
made for difficult work and had their own songs, as did the act of
cutting trees. [This was the legacy of plantation work -- a way for
workers to keep in rhythm so that none of them would be punished for
going too slowly. These work songs, so intimately connected with
plantation slavery and chain gangs were in decline as this form of
indentured labour went into decline.]{.underline} As a result
folklorists came from the north to record this music. (PLAY VIDEO CLIP:
Pete Seeger "Afro-American Work Songs in a Texas Prison" excerpt) (start
speaking a minute in) However [in this film, it is hard to find the name
of even one of these workers, or a shot of their face.]{.underline} The
voiceover extols the improved prison conditions in this area and the men
working on the chain gang move in formation in spotless white throwing
their skin into relief. [There is an industrial machinic feel to their
movement and yet in their singing there is an enervation the viewer
feels in the rhythm of song and movement]{.underline}. We see them
cutting trees en mass and as one tree begins to tumble, an arrythmy in
their singing erupts. Some call out as the tree tips to the ground but
even before it makes contact, the singing begins anew in another wave.
[It's difficult to see the men singing and working in rhythm in their
pristine uniforms for the camera,]{.underline} and difficult to hear
Pete Seeger talk about these great new prisons[. But the presence of the
prison guard mounted on his horse looking down on them undermines
thi]{.underline}s. And [under the watchful eye]{.underline} of the guard
and the camera and Seeger's voice over, something 4 else happens in this
afterlife of the hold, [another kind of syncopation of movement that
gets the overseers' job done but also collects from below,]{.underline}
in the rhythm and singing, a powerful force that moves this indentured
labour in another direction.

### Speculative Fiction Good

#### Speculative fiction solves -- it offers a space to reimagine histories erased or distorted by colonial oppression narratives, creates room for envisioning liberated futures beyond and grounds hope and resistance in imaginative possibility. Afrofuturist imaginaries is necessary to explore identity, memory, and diaspora and affirm Black cultural experience

**Allan '19.** Angela S. Allan; "Our Sense of Purpose": Speculative
Fiction and Systems Reading. Novel 1 November 2019; 52 (3): 406--424.

The problem Mark McGurl identifies as the ["popular distrust of
institutions]{.underline}," which has become "a virtual institution in
its own right, "bears consideration in this context (341). Distrusted
though they may be, institutions also have their value. Amid the
instability of what Ulrich Beck terms "reflexive modernity" (qtd. in
McGurl342),McGurl argues [that literature could "attempt to stabilize a
culture\...by cycling back through previous cultural forms and, in
effect, re-institutionalizing them"(342]{.underline}).The conventions of
literature---genre and, by extension, genre fiction--- might be the
focus of literary preservation in the face of reflexive modernity's
threat to social institutions. McGurl suggests that the literature best
equipped to critique reflexive modernity is speculative fiction.2
Similarly, Theodore Martin's recent book, Contemporary Drift: Genre,
Historicism, and the Problem of the Present (2017), [explains how genre
fiction provides "a powerful social tool for making sense of what is
emergent and unfamiliar about our contemporary moment" (7). Like McGurl
and Martin, I want to argue that speculative fiction can tell its
readers much about the critical practices and biases of the contemporary
moment, but I also want to suggest how and why genre enacts a system of
reading of its own.]{.underline} If, according to Clifford Siskin, genre
is "a form that works physically in the world to mediate our efforts to
know it," then genre fiction endures to alert its readers to the
systematic aspect of literary interpretation itself as well as to
changes in that system (System 1). Not all readers---or writers---are
pleased with generic persistence. In a much publicized debate between
Margaret Atwood and Ursula K. LeGuin, genre fiction still evokes
accusations of the sub literary[. "Science fiction has monsters and
space ships,"]{.underline} Atwood scoffed in a 2003 interview;
"[speculative fiction *could really happen*"]{.underline} (Potts).3
Speculative fiction still has its skeptics, although more so-called
literary writers have coopted the genre. Cormac McCarthy, Colson
Whitehead, and Emily St. John Mandel have borrowed the tropes of
dystopian futures, and perhaps as a result of this appropriation
speculative fiction now feels like a tired and exhausted mode to many
readers. Ursula Heise argues that contemporary ["portrayals of
apocalypse tend to recycle well-known motifs from earlier science
fiction, and their visions of the future serve mostly to recon firm
well-established views of the present."]{.underline} Defenders of
speculative fiction have tended to [embrace the genre's capacity to
speak to present realities and to make political statements rather than
to push the boundaries of the literary]{.underline} (see Gottlieb;
Oziewicz; and Hicks). [Imagined this way, speculative fiction's primary
utility comes from its ability to allegorize and moralize. It warns
rather than reforms.]{.underline}

#### Speculative fiction creates hope through utopian pedagogies and performance of such pedagogies. Hope is key to healing and taking political action towards combating oppressive systems 

**Thorne 21**, Syd Thorne, 12-2021, \"Through Critique and Beyond:
Speculative Fiction as a Tool of Critical Pedagogy,\" Publisher,
https://repository.usfca.edu/capstone/1288/// MargaRet!

This field projects centers around the issue of hopelessness among
teachers and students and [examines the genre of speculative fiction as
a potential tool for cultivating critical hope in the classroom and as
an asset to critical pedagogy.]{.underline} [Utopian pedagogy and
critical pedagogy make up the theoretical framework of this research and
project development. The research explores the use of speculative
fiction in three areas: activism and identity, student engagement, and
utopian performance.]{.underline} The review of the literature
demonstrates that the use of speculative fiction in the classroom has
the potential to engage students in conversations about social justice
and provide opportunities for students to express their feelings about
the future, which could [aid in the cultivation of critical hope.
This]{.underline} research led to the development of a learning guide
which includes sample lessons for grades 9 and above and utilize
reading, creative writing, and performance as methods of engaging with
speculative fiction. The lessons invite teachers and students to work
with short stories from Octavia's Brood (ed. Imarisha, W., Brown, A.M.,
Thomas, S. R., 2015) and include questions for discussion, activities,
and questions for reflection. The learning guide also includes
recommendations for further reading and curriculum development. [bell
hooks writes that "educating is always a vocation rooted in hopefulness"
yet maintaining hope, and fostering critical hope in others seems to be
an increasingly difficult task, as those practicing critical pedagogy
from within marginalized communities bear witness to and often
experience first-hand, daily assaults on hope by the hands of structural
violence and oppression (2003, p.xiv). Jeffery M.R. Duncan-Andrade
(2009) states "there has been an assault on hope, particularly in our
nation's urban centers.]{.underline} This attack has taken place on
numerous fronts, including disinvestment in schools and overinvestment
in a prison industrial complex" (p.2). This idea is echoed by Shawn
Ginwright (2015) in his book Hope and Healing in Urban Education. [He
talks about how students are often exposed to an "ecosystem of toxic
environments" especially in urban schools where students experience
structural oppression and structural violence in the form of racism,
classism, heterosexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism,
etc. (p.3).]{.underline} Ginwright's observations about the dangerous
effects of hopelessness on youth's physical, emotional, social, and
spiritual health lead him to look to the healing justice movement for
ways to repair individual and community trauma (Ginwright, 2015). He
grounds his work in three major ideas about hope[. First, "structural
oppression harms hope", second, "healing is a critical component in
building hope" and third, "building hope is an important political
activity" (Ginwright, 2015, p.2). Just as systems of oppression work in
multitudes of different ways and affect each community and individual
differently, it is important to approach healing from an equally diverse
and intersectional lens, and to look for tools in places they may be
least expected]{.underline}. [Speculative fiction has an important place
in critical pedagogy and in the pursuit of healing and building hope in
the field of education.]{.underline} The term "speculative fiction" has
many conflicting definitions that have changed over time, but for the
purpose of this project, one of the most expansive definitions fits
best. Marek Oziewicz, in his 2017 article for the Oxford Research
Encyclopedia of Literature, discusses the difficult task of defining
speculative fiction, calling it a "[fuzzy super-set category that houses
all non-mimetic-genres---genres that in one way or another depart from
imitating conscious reality"]{.underline} (p.2). Genres typically housed
under the speculative fiction umbrella include science fiction, fantasy,
dystopian/utopian fiction, and horror. **[These genres, in contrast to
other forms of fiction, "construct models of reality" rather than
transcribe it directly and can also be understood as a "thought
experiment that embraces an open-ended vision of the
real"]{.underline}** (Marek, 2017, p.3). Because it is such an expansive
category, I have chosen to include scholarship that analyses the use of
speculative fiction works that [have specific connections to themes of
justice and liberation]{.underline}. These works are most often written
by people of color, women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community,
\[dis\]abled authors, and [authors that experience life at the
intersection of multiple marginalized identities]{.underline} and many
of these works of speculative fiction serve as critiques and responses
to oppression. A recent surge in justice oriented speculative fiction
has also given birth to new terms and definitions. For example, the
authors of Octavia's. Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice
Movements developed the term "[visionary fiction" to distinguish science
fiction that has "relevance toward building new, freer worlds from the
mainstream strain of science fiction, which most often reinforces
dominant narratives of power]{.underline}" (Imarisha, 2015, p.4). This
constant process of challenging and creating new definitions speaks to
the ways [that speculative fiction has evolved and the ways that it has
gained increasing acceptance and legitimacy in both academic and popular
culture, making space for new and emerging storytellers to join in
conversation with seminal voices in the tradition.]{.underline}
Speculative fiction usually deals with imaginary or fantastical worlds,
but many subjects and themes are [rooted in the writers' lived
experiences,]{.underline} often incorporating thoughts and feelings
about the worlds they live in, the worlds that they desire living in, as
well as the worlds that they fear living in. [The reflective,
analytical, critical and constructive qualities of speculative fiction
are what make the genre a useful tool for critical
pedagogy.]{.underline} Engaging with the genre through reading, writing
and performance can uplift the voices people from marginalized
communities, facilitate generative conversations about systems of
oppression and how they manifest in our daily lives, and provide a space
for experimentation with ideas about the future, all of which have the
power to aid in the cultivation of critical hope in the classroom.
Studies by S.R Toliver (2020, Sarah E. Truman (2019), Julie Doyle
(2020), and Leigh Anne Howard (2019), have shown that students of all
ages are capable of creative, critical, and self-reflective thinking
through the lens of speculative fiction and the practice has [potential
to aid in the healing of collective and individual trauma by moving
beyond critique and imagining more just worlds]{.underline}. These
studies also show how speculative fiction can be an effective tool in
engaging students in various, often difficult topics such as police
violence, white supremacy, climate crisis, gender binary, and other
topics related to identity and oppression.

### Hero mythology & White Supremacy

#### White hero epistemologies require forms of anti black masculinity as the force that guides expansion into the uncharted setting of the arctic.

**Newton 17.** Arielle Newton. June 2, 2017. "Only white men are
heroes". https://racebaitr.com/2017/06/02/white-men-heroes/ // mars

**[In America, only white men are heroes. In America, a nation defined
by its white supremacist and colonial core, heroism is also shaped by
how successful white men were (and are) at destroying the sanctity and
self-sufficiency of marginalized, disenfranchised people.]{.underline}
[Communities that survive the ramifications of these heroic tyrants must
then perform the labor to correct revisionist misinterpretations of
their heroic oppressors.]{.underline}** [We push biographers,
historians, politicians and other agents trained under the specter of
white supremacy to acknowledge and hold accountable their heroes. **We
demand they cease in their laudations of the heroic genocidaire that is
Christopher Columbus, the heroic rapist that is Thomas Jefferson, and
the heroic terrorist that is Andrew Jackson,**]{.underline} **among
others.As [blatant anti-Black and anti-indigenous racism becomes more
taboo and invisibilized, white supremacy is further evolving in the ways
it thrusts its heroes upon us.]{.underline} T[o quell a groundswell of
outrage in oppressed communities and to further a deceptively
self-interested public relations agenda, white supremacists have
introduced sanitized versions of Black changemakers into their canon of
heroes.]{.underline} The most obvious example of this hokum is [Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., whose radical militant political expressions are
shielded from public view while the white response to him is rebranded
from the overwhelming opposition that ultimately killed him into
adulation for his "commitment" to nonviolence. White supremacy's
shape-shifting ability to beguile and smear facts and nuance is the
reason why when Black radical militants of today applaud or take part in
contemporary rebellions, our mentions are flooded with basic headass
white (and Black) liberals about how ashamed Dr. King would
be.]{.underline}** T[oday, with the advent of crowdsourced fundraising
platforms**, people who have been blighted with white supremacist
messaging, signaling, dog whistling, and experience get to determine in
greater numbers who gets to be knighted as heroes.**]{.underline}**In
Portland, [when Ricky John Best and Teliesin Myrddin Namki Meche died
and Micah David-Cole Fletcher was injured after trying to "[calm
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/us/portland-train-attack-muslim-rant.html)"
(not fight or chastise) a rampant neo-Nazi, they instantly became
heroes, a legacy concretized after a deluge of donations went to the

this,]{.underline}**
**[[\$115,000](https://www.youcaring.com/survivorsofthemaxattack-833557).
They aren't heroes in the ways white supremacy defines. The main
ingredient in white supremacist heroism is prohibiting the focus on
those "saved" but lionizing those who are "saving." We never center or
celebrate survivors of torment, and instead treat them with suspicion
should they ask or demand that their lives be restored.]{.underline}**
It is in this vein that some organizers of and donors to the viral
fundraising drives for Best, Meche, and Fletcher allegedly "[feel
wrong](https://www.facebook.com/marissa.jenae.johnson/posts/10213049685940126?comment_id=10213058601723015&reply_comment_id=10213058997092899&notif_t=feed_comment_reply&notif_id=1496193843801204)"
about uplifting the teenage Muslim girls who can never safely travel on
public transit again. **[Some even went so far as saying these girls
should feel bad for taking money that could go to "the survivor"-- the
white man.]{.underline}** Thankfully, the two Muslim girls received a
modest surge in donations after Marissa Jenae Johnson, Co-Founder and
Content Director of Safety Pinbox, amplified this discrepancy in a viral
Facebook post hyperlinked above. An additional and substantial influx of
donations came in after Fletcher, our hero, made a [public
appeal](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/31/us/portland-train-stabbing/).
Through this gesture, he concretized his heroism in appearing humble,
sacrificial and thoughtful. He "saved" the two Muslim girls again. Once
again, [white supremacy is reinforced and strengthened in both its
institutional embeddedness and in its decentralization.]{.underline} How
white supremacy crafts daily interactions and engagements shows itself
in public fundraising. Studies have
[shown](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/crowdfunding-success-kickstarter-kiva-succeed/400232/)
that on crowdsourced platforms, white benefactors see more dollars more
quickly from the public**. [White supremacy shapes our ideals of
heroism. It motivates us to disregard those who will deal with the
long-lasting consequences of upheaval and eulogize those sparse and
ephemeral moments of debatable courage which in time become
legend.]{.underline} But [Black women and femmes relentlessly force us
to honor, recognize, and praise the Black, indigenous, and Latinx
freedom fighters that white supremacy ruthlessly and desperately wants
us to ignore]{.underline}.**

#### The mythos of US heroism is intertwined with a kind of white savior innocence that reinforces antiblack social order -- historically arctic exploration is often steeped with the rhetoric that perpetuates "white altruism" and can be hijacked to justify interpersonal violence

**Madison 99.** Kelly J. Madison. December 1999. "Legitimation Crisis
and Containment: The "Anti-Racist-White-Hero" Film. Critical Studies in
Mass Communication. // mars

Hollywood portrayals of race relations not only tend to fail in
accuracy, but also promote harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies
that unnecessarily complicate perceived racial differences and,
subsequently, interracial communication (Stoddard & Marcus, 2006).
Depictions of interracial relations in film often perpetuate the
ideology of colorblindness, which portrays a false image of equality
among members of all races (Ash, 2015). Relatedly, **["White innocence"
denies White privilege and erases the ways in which people of color are
subject to racial discrimination]{.underline}** (Ash, 2015). Although
[**depictions of Whites as colorblind and paternalistic are all too
common**, t**hey often appear alongside racist depictions of Blacks as
inferior and/or subservient.** These stereotypes include (but are not
limited to) t**he mammy, jezebel, athlete, "Magical Negro," and Uncle
Tom**]{.underline}**.** For example, the "Magical Negro" stereotype is
featured in popular films including Ghost (1990), The Green Mile (1999),
and Bruce Almighty (2003; Glenn & Cunningham, 2009), whereas the "mammy"
figures prominently in Tyler Perry's numerous Madea films (McKoy, 2012).
In Freedom Writers and The Blind Side---two films that recuperate the
White savior narrative---[**Blacks are portrayed through harmful
stereotypes** including **the absent father, angry Black woman, and,**
more broadly, **the dysfunctional Black f2amily.** When **Black
characters are portrayed as damaged and/or dysfunctional, it sets the
stage for filmmakers to introduce a White hero to save Blacks from
tragedy. The narrative of the White savior typically involves a White
lead character (agent) who lends a helping hand to a person or people of
color** (act) out of the goodwill of her or his heart]{.underline}
(purpose). As Hughey (2012) explained, [The **films show Whites going
the extra-mile to help people of color who cannot or will not help
themselves**, thus **establishing social order, teaching non-Whites
right from wrong, and framing the White Savior as the only character
able to recognize these moral distinctions and act upon
them.**]{.underline} (p. 761) In Burkean terms, t[he White savior format
foregrounds an agent-act ratio, wherein **the agent (White savior) is
defined by the act for which she or he receives credit (helping people
of color).**]{.underline} **[This narrative perpetuates the image of
White altruism,]{.underline} [an attractive tale for White viewers who
may believe they are unfairly implicated in systemic
racism]{.underline}** [(]{.underline}Ash, 2015; Hughey, 2012). Burke's
theory of dramatism lends itself perfectly to the study of film. As
Rushing (1986) argues, "the pentad is especially adaptable to
understanding rhetoric viewed as narration or myth" (p. 291). Burke's
(1969) five pentadic terms are invoked in any statement about motives,
yet they "can be embodied profoundly or trivially, truthfully or
falsely" (p. xv). [The White savior narrative represents a profound
misuse of these terms in a forum that has the ability to inform the
public about interracial relations]{.underline}. Rather than portray
complex characters that challenge stereotypes, Hollywood too often opts
for "safer" narratives that direct attention to White character(s) and
away from the non-White character(s). As a misrepresentation of
historical and contemporary interracial relations, [the White savior is
a narrative about what people do and why they do it. What is involved in
this narrative, as in any narrative, is a series of terms about thought:
act, agent, agency, scene, and purpose.]{.underline}

#### White savior functions to simultaneously erase and romanticize racism. 

**Murphy and Harris 17**, Mollie K. Murphy &Tina M. Harris, 06-16-17,
\"White Innocence and Black Subservience: The Rhetoric of White Heroism
in The Help,\" Publisher,

MargaRet!

[The White savior is a pervasive narrative that unnecessarily
complicates the depictions of race relations between Whites and
communities of color.]{.underline} This all-too familiar trope regularly
floods the screen of Hollywood films and is either celebrated or
unexamined (Ash, 2015; de Oca, 2012; Fitzgerald, 2013; Glenn &
Cunningham, 2009; Hughey, 2012). Although storylines that engage
characters of color perpetuate negatively stigmatized tropes that embody
an inordinate number of human fallacies and deficiencies, [White
characters are raised to a higher standard. They are presented as the
unattainable norm to which all other groups must aspire.]{.underline} In
the White savior narrative, [images of White morality and superiority
are maintained, thus reifying conceptions of racial difference and White
goodness]{.underline}. Moreover, the [White savior narrative
romanticizes racism against Blacks, thus freeing Whites of guilt and
responsibility]{.underline} (Ash, 2015; Hughey, 2012). These themes are
readily apparent in The Help, and it is through Burke's (1969) theory of
dramatism that we are able to better understand how the trope functions
to sell a limited and troubling statement about motives. This article
has demonstrated how [the White savior in The Help functions by
constraining scene, agency, and purpose to create the conditions for the
emergence of a White hero.]{.underline} This, in turn, defines the
act--agent ratio; what took place is inextricably linked to the kind of
person who committed the act. As a White, innocent, and moral figure
with agency, Skeeter becomes the story's primary agent. In contrast,
Aibileen and Minny are subservient; they are grateful for Skeeter's
willingness to liberate people of color. Although a clear hierarchy
exists, the film depicts reciprocal love between Blacks and Whites,
which serves, in part, as the characters' motivation for writing the
book. [Emphasis on love works to excuse the racist hierarchy and race of
the hero so White audiences can feel comfortable consuming the
narrative. By unpacking the various elements at play in the White savior
narrative, this article offers audiences the tools to articulate the
various ways in which the White savior format constrains the narrative
to maintain a racist status quo]{.underline}. A dramatistic perspective
reveals the mechanical features of the White savior format, thus
refuting counterarguments that praise such films as harmless or even
progressive. [Although this critique offers support for further
examination of film narratives as critical texts for mass consumption,
it also illustrates the importance of societal understandings of the
role of history in framing contemporary race relations in real world
contexts. People are rarely challenged to think critically about the
ways in which the powerful (e.g., dominant) and the powerless (e.g.,
nondominant) experience their respective realities]{.underline} (Cranmer
& Harris, 2015; Harris, 2001; Park, Gabbadon, & Chernin, 2006; Schultz,
2014). In the case of films and other forms of entertainment media,
[there is a tendency to gloss over the harshness of these markedly
different worldviews by minimizing the seriousness of the systemic
oppression to which the historically marginalized are subjected and of
which the oppressors are direct (and indirect) benefactors]{.underline}
(Dates & Mascaro, 2005; Park et al., 2006). Moreover, [relations between
the privileged and oppressed are subjected to revisionist narratives
that frame race relations as more egalitarian and harmonious than they
have been]{.underline} (Ash, 2015; Hughey, 2012). [Such framings dismiss
the extent to which Whiteness is positioned as the dominant narrative
from which to view the world; marginalized experiences are reduced to
irrelevant narratives that become overshadowed by this emphasis on White
privilege. The White savior is a primary trope that serves to fuel the
toxic ideology of the perceived "legitimacy" and validity of White
innocence and Black subservience in both fictive and real world
contex]{.underline}

### Fungibility & Colonization

#### Black Female fungibility is bound to settler colonialism. Through the logics of white spaticalization and geography.

**King 13.** Tiffany Jeanette King. 2013. "In the Clearing: Black Female
Bodies, Space, and Settler Colonial Landscapes." Department of American
Studies. // mars

The production---or calling forth---of Black female gender within the
context of the settlement/plantation becomes a discourse for the making
and enactment of a kind of property that we do not spend a lot of time
theorizing. [Black female bodies, like the blue-handed slave women in
Dash's movie, function as a form of property-plus.]{.underline} B[eyond
their productive and reproductive capacity they have spatial capacity.
B**lack women cultivate (plow, till, fence, plant) the land and make the
settlement/plantation appear as a bounded unit of sellable and taxable
agriculture.** **Black women also reproduce children who become forms of
commodity and workers who can continue to work on the land to expand the
settlement/plantation**. Black women as a form of property-plus produce:
**the settlement/plantation, children as commodities and expanders of
the settlement/plantation-plot, and bodies that mark the plantation
space as non-Native space. Black women's property capacity is one that
makes Settler-Master spaces and creates the boundaries of the
human**]{.underline}**. [The creation of Black female gender by the
Settler-Master works to produce a spatial unit of conquest, enslavement,
and an exclusionary form of humanism through the black female
body]{.underline}.** [Constructions of **gender and sexuality based on
the body necessarily emerge in a moment in which the settler needs
space, specifically land. Body centric gender works in tandem with the
visual practices of surveying the land**]{.underline}.58 As t[he
Settler, who would also become a Master,]{.underline} visualized the
possibilities of their territory, he/she/they were simultaneously
surveying, visualizing and assessing the possibilities of the Black
bodies they would own. **[The Black body and its productive and
reproductive components would also be read/visualized as spatial units
on "virgin" land]{.underline}.** While Dash did not intend this for her
work, her optic can help us see the way that the Settler-Master viewed
the land, slave bodies and slave reproduction. Dash's characters' blue
hands on one level work to make the body hyper visible. With this optic
of the blue hands, we can see the calling forth/hailing of gender as the
reproduction of the settlement/plantation at the level of the body. This
is just one order of sight that Dash makes possible. We will continue to
explore the more liberatory dimensions of sight that Dash uses to break
down violent western epistemes. [**Black female bodies as gendered and
sexualized formation are spatial processes within the context of New
World settlement**. In early 18th century South Carolina and Virginia
**representations of Black women as savages and bodies occupying a
liminal position began to emerge**]{.underline}**. [Black bodily
liminality was discursively imagined and relationship that Black women
would have with the land in the New World.]{.underline}** The Black
female body as a new form on the landscape in the low country and the
Caribbean had to be reconciled to their actual role as workers and the
natural surroundings in West Africa. [While the female body had been
constructed as strong, capable of work and naturally fecund; the reality
was that Black women did not labor under the conditions of slavery when
they were in West Africa.]{.underline} They were also not laborers in
the way that they would become on plantations. Europeans' need for free
labor shaped the inner eyes of the first Europeans who would view Black
bodies leading them to construct Black female forms as natural laborers
on foreign plantation landscapes. [**European traders and explorers
produced colonial travel writings that narrated Black female bodies as
naturally fit for plantation work in the colonies.**]{.underline}
Lignon, one of the original Settlers of Barbados, first observed Black
women in his travels to West Africa. When he saw them again for the
first time on plantations in Barbados he had a hard time recognizing
them in the new context: Lignon struggled to situate Black women as
workers. Their innate unfamiliarity as laborers caused him to cast about
for a useful metaphor. He compares African people to vegetation; now
they are only passively and abstractly beautiful as blocks of color. A
gap existed between the colonial imagination's construction of Black
women as agricultural labors that could easily breed and the reality
that West African Black women were unfamiliar with the land and the
labor required on the plantation. In order to close the gap, a new
metaphor was needed. The metaphor is a space of slippage where one thing
can become another.60 Within this slippage**, [Black women can become
nature to fill in the gap.]{.underline}** [In the context of this
discursive gap where metaphors of nature are used to make sense of the
presence of bodies new to the landscape]{.underline}, I return to Dash's
filmic character Nana PeazantWhile Dash is certainly not using Lignon's
imperial surveying eyes, D[ash's **cinematic imagination does provide a
visual of the ways that the Settler-Master intended to discursively fix
the Black female slave body to the land**]{.underline}**.** [Lignon's
vision which turned Black female bodies into beautiful blocks of color
became a way of establishing a relationship between Black female bodies
and the land and Black female bodies and human bodies]{.underline}.
Dash's blue stained female slaves as an optic provide us with an
opportunity to engage in some rigorous theoretical work. Dash's
character's indigo stained or blue-black flesh represents ontological
difference of a new order. [The states of being/non-being presented for
us on the screen by Dash, though unintentionally, is the essential
human/non-human difference that Lignon and other Settler-Masters were
invested in producing. he essential difference that Nana Peazant's
blue-stained hands, and Lignon's block of colors that matched vegetation
represent expand how we are be able to talk about ontology. **If we
think about Black female bodies that are stained with, or are already a
part of the land, we can argue that ontological positions are created
through the multiple axes of race, gender, space and the land. The
body's relationship to space, specifically a forced relationship to
land, is a field of representational and repressive power that needs to
be examined further**]{.underline}. **T[he indigo-stained hands
(blue-blackness) function as a visible sign of the violence and a new
spatial relationship to land that makes the slave a form of non-human
property]{.underline}**. The indigo-blue Black female body is a spatial
body**[. She is a symbol of space or property in its most malleable and
unstable state.]{.underline}** As a new order of difference she exceeds
mere racial and sexual variation. [Her ultimate difference also comes
about due to the fact that **it is spatialized and embedded in the
settler geography of expansion and increase. The Black female slave
body's spatial coordinates, stained indigo, do not align with those of
other humans**]{.underline}**.** he captive body gendered female is an
important process and formation to track**. [The process of making the
Black female captive body coterminous with the land is particularly
important to track as a spatial process that helps solidify taxonomies
on settler colonial landscapes]{.underline}.** Expansion, specificall[y
s**patial expansion, is an ongoing project of settler colonialism that
shapes processes of racial, gender and sexual formation.** Gender,
specifically B**lack female slave gender, as visualized by Dash, is as
much a product of the settling and making of space as it is about
reproducing other Black slaves.**]{.underline} Dash's blue-handed bodies
provide us with an opportunity to think about how the
settlement/plantation can produce a hybrid body that functions as a
regime of representation through which gender formation works.
Discourses of sexuality, specifically sexual deviance, also work at the
site of Black female slave bodies[. **The Black female slave body
embedded within the sexualized landscape of settler colonialism is a
special case.**]{.underline} As a hybrid body, Nana Peazant's and other
**[Black female's plant and flesh bodies could also have discourses of
deviant sexualities placed upon them. Black female bodies can merge/mate
with plants and create the commodity dye. The fecundity of plant
reproduction/sexuality can now be plotted onto the landscape of the
Black female body]{.underline}.** I[n the tropics, specifically the
Caribbean the discourse of sexual promiscuity**, fertility and abundance
was applied to the natural landscape, specifically new and exotic plant
life. Black female gender as a hybrid plant-body assumes another level
of non-normative and non-human sexual excess when understood within the
context of the conquest and settlement of land. Within the context of
slavery, it is equally important to mark Black bodies as examples of
non-human sexual difference and devianc**e.]{.underline} Hartman finds
that sexualized Black bodies were interpellated by the law as unnamable
and at times unintelligible.61 According to George's attorney \[George
is a slave accused of rape\], the sexual arrangements of the captive
community were so different from those of the dominant order that they
were beyond the reach of the law and best left to the regulations of
slave owners...as sexual subjects they were beyond the pale of law and
outside the boundaries of the decent and nameable."62 Existing as bodies
outside of what the law and the dominant Settler-Master's boundaries
deem "decent and nameable" relegates the Black gendered and sexual body
to a realm of the illegible and inhuman. This unnamable gender and
sexual difference is a violent eviction of Black female and Black bodies
from the boundaries of humanity. The discourse of gender and sexuality
as it often appears in the law is a way of creating a spatial order
within the settlement/plantation regime of the US. Black female slave
bodies as hybrid, plant-human species, further increase the unameability
of the Black gender and sexual difference.

## Impacts

### White Heroism

#### Manifest destiny creates American development as a mythological force that expands ever onwards into the forms of dispossession.

[Before spending some more words on this characterization of nature as a
sentient and malevolent]{.underline} ([from the expedition's point of
view]{.underline}, [of course]{.underline}) being, I would like to
re-connect this connotation to its ideological substratum, [in order to
better clarify Manifest Destiny's desecrating critique of "The Epic of
America", as James Truslow Adams defined it]{.underline}. [As I made
clear at the beginning]{.underline}, [the American West has been the
repository of a large part of the US's national mythology]{.underline}.
[The connection between geography and ethos]{.underline}, or between
space and ideology, [was probably pinpointed for the first time by
Frederick Jackson Turner's "The Significance of the Frontier in American
History"]{.underline} (1893). In this famous and debated essay, [the
historian considered the frontier stage of American expansion -- in
regard to the worldview and social philosophy it brought along --
something to be retained]{.underline}, at least ideally, at all costs.
[Only by embracing a perennial frontier state of mind the American
people could maintain a firm grasp on progress]{.underline}, [thus
ensuring their endurance through the centuries]{.underline}. [Turner's
paradigm is obviously a mindful mix of overt optimism and sheer
nationalism]{.underline}, [and his analysis hasn't stood the test of
time -- as a matter of fact it has been discussed]{.underline},
critiqued, revisited, [debunked and problematized by a great number of
historic approaches that came after Marco Petrelli]{.underline},
[Manifest Destiny]{.underline}: [the American West as a Map of the
Unconscious 6 it]{.underline}, [most notably by the historians belonging
to the "New Western History" current]{.underline}. [The myth of the
"Garden of the World", an explosive version of the pastoral vision that
developed on the eastern coast]{.underline} (and especially in
Virginia), [maintains the latter's utopian nature and strong religious
slant]{.underline}. [It shouldn't come as a surprise]{.underline}, then,
[that was Thomas Jefferson himself that ordered the Lewis and Clark
expedition -- his Notes on the State of Virginia]{.underline}, written
in 1785, [is a milestone of American ruralism]{.underline}, [and a key
text to understand American pastoralism in general]{.underline}. [A
now-classic study on the western frontier]{.underline}, Henry Nash
Smith's Virgin Land, [underlines the connection between the original
Virginian Edenic ideal and its western counterpart through the mediation
of President Jefferson]{.underline}. [«The importance of the Lewis and
Clarke expedition», writes Nash Smith]{.underline}, [«lay on the level
of imagination]{.underline}: it was drama, [it was the enactment of a
myth that embodied the future]{.underline}. It gave tangible substance
to what had been merely an idea» (Nash Smith 1950: 18). Working to
undermine rather than to epitomize this myth, [Manifest Destiny gives
shape and depth to its authors' iconoclastic take on the frontier's
ideological legacy and its mythological assets]{.underline}. [Nothing
less than a vanguard in charge of 'seizing' the continent's geography in
order to claim it]{.underline}, [the expedition was also hidden beneath
the make-believe mask of a scientific exploration]{.underline}. [As it
is made clear by President Jefferson himself]{.underline}, (Issue 24:
19) [there is a "war" going on]{.underline}, [and the expedition's
mission is far from being a peaceful one]{.underline}. «Without blood
there is no prosperity \[...\]» says Captain Helm ([a character I am
going to discuss later on]{.underline}), [and only the side willing to
spill innocent blood «shall win the war and rule the land»]{.underline}
([ibid.: 20). Although mapping and naturalistic classification were not
the main concern of the corps]{.underline}, [the series heightens this
aspect by showing an overenthusiastic Lewis as he names the newly
discovered species]{.underline} ([a true American Adam descending
through hell]{.underline}), meticulously stores plant and flower
specimens and generally devotes all his attention to the strange new
world he passes through. «Too much focus can be dangerous» (Issue 31:
18) [says the always practical Clark to a daydreaming Lewis as the
latter is absorbed by the study of the mysterious and ominous
arches]{.underline}. Between, vol. 8, n. 15 (Maggio/May 2018) 7
Ironically, [this pronouncement is a perfect meta-comment on the series
itself]{.underline}: [Manifest Destiny's sometimes pedantic attention to
Louisiana's strange and horrific biosphere1 is but a hint to go over the
surface of things by stripping the myth of its glorifying
aura]{.underline}. Lewis's obsessive nomenclatural patina can't really
hide what is beneath: [a landscape of horror]{.underline}, [death and
fear upon which American democracy laid the foundation for its
myths]{.underline}.

### Nationalism Bad

#### Patriotism produces forms of glacial amnesia that reproduce the logics of slavery. --- everything from the revolution forward is produced through the logic of glorification that crumbles our memories towards the logics of slavery

Steve **Martinot** 03 Jun **2010** "Patriotism and Its Double" Peace

//BucKy

Let us return to origins, [against a seemingly glacial
amnesia]{.underline}. [The founding of the U]{.underline}.S. [as a
nation was itself a process of invention]{.underline}. [This nation was
cobbled together out of a diverse settler society whose traditions
stretched from the Puritan village to corporate
colonization]{.underline}, from northern shipping to southern plantation
agro-business, from theocratic governance to slave-holding culture.
[When the Constitution proclaims]{.underline}, "we, [the people," it is
performing the act of invention that brings the "new
nation"]{.underline} ([in the words of Lincoln]{.underline}) into
existence. [That is]{.underline}, the United States did not emerge from
its own inherently unifying linguistic, cultural, or historical
traditions. It had to define itself first. Upon what disparity with
England did it then define itself? After all, [the Declaration of
Independence assumes a disparity between "people" when it "dissolves"
the "political bands" that connect people as groups]{.underline}. [The
colonies were British settlements]{.underline}, [and
slavery]{.underline}, corporate economy, and theocratic government were
no strangers to Britain. Furthermore, [the American Revolution was not
itself anti-colonialist]{.underline} (had it been, it would have been
led by Native Americans, African American slaves, [and British
indentureds). The U]{.underline}.S. did not abandon colonialism.
[Insofar as slavery represented the continued colonization of
Africans]{.underline}, [and Manifest Destiny represented the continued
seizure of land and dislocation of Native and Mexican
peoples]{.underline}, [the revolution essentially produced a mere change
of colonial administration]{.underline}. Its goal was a more unified
control over the territory as land value, [and over the double wealth of
slavery]{.underline} ([as value-producing labor and as real estate
wealth). Independence primarily meant no longer having to share the
proceeds of that wealth with a distant monarchy]{.underline}.

#### The Imperial nature of US national identity, masked under the guise of "patriotism", is used by racist hegemons like Trump to manipulate Americans into hating non-white people by framing them as "unpatriotic"

**Murty**, Komanduri S., **et al** 20**18**. "African American Students'
Perceptions Toward NFL Kneeling and Trump's Reaction: Racial Justice v.
Patriotism." *Race, Gender & Class*, vol. 25, no. 1--2, 2018, pp.
77--97. *JSTOR*, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26649535. Accessed 3 July

The controversy of the anthem protest was spurred by President Trump's
actions. On September 22, 2017, during his stop at a rally in
Huntsville, Alabama, to support his chosen Republican Primary Senator
candidate Luther Strange, [Trump asked his supporters (primarily White
working-class evangelists and NRA members from red states): "Wouldn't
you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our
flag, to say, '**Get that son of a bitch off the field right now.** Out!
He's fired. He's fired!'"]{.underline} Subsequently, he tweeted on
September 24, 2017: ["If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players
stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place
fast. Fire or suspend!"]{.underline} (Davis, 2017). On the next day, he
tweeted again: "So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They
won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag---they said it
loud and clear!" (Scarry, 2017). Enraged by these and other similar
actions, the American public disapproved them in larger numbers than
they did the protests themselves. For example, a Huffington Post survey
found that 48% said that it is inappropriate for an NFL player to kneel
during the national anthem; that 8% suggested that players should find a
different way to protest during games; that 76% felt that they should
only protest in private life; and, that 13% did not think that players
should protest at any time. On the other hand, 54% disapproved of
Trump's response, of whom 42% strongly disapproved; and, only one-third
approved. [Corrine McConnaughy, a political scientist at George
Washington University found from her study that: (1) **when shown a
peaceful protest, white conservatives especially disapproved if black
men were the protesters;** (2) this resentment is fueled by
**stereotypes of black men as uniquely violent, which of course fits
with football player imagery**; and, (3) the narrative of black men as
violent **is also an important factor in opposition to Black Lives
Matter**. Therefore, she concluded that Trump has good reasons to
believe the attack on black NFL players protesting is a **perfect fodder
for this base** (McConnaughy, 2017).]{.underline} Her findings are
similar to those of the Elon University Poll, wherein 94% percent of
blacks compared to only 51% whites; and, 67% of females compared to only
57% of males in a North Carolina sample disagreed with Trump that NFL
players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired (Husser
2017:10). [Anthony Weems, a doctoral student in Sport Management at
Texas A&M University also concluded that the "**language of white racism
today is often masked by claims to patriotism**," by juxtaposing Trump's
actions with those in other contexts (Weems, 2017, para 17):... when US
President **Trump referred to neo-Nazis marching in the streets of
Charlottesville, Virginia as "very fine people" and black NFL athletes
as unpatriotic "sons of a bitches,**]{.underline}**"** NFL players were
explicitly put in a position where they had to decide between standing
for justice and supporting white supremacy\.... The real patriots in
this scenario are those that have (and continue to) courageously use
their social platforms to bring critical issues to the forefront in the
quest to make liberty, justice, and democracy a reality for all. Real
patriots stand alongside one another and against systemic forms of
oppression such as police brutality. Real patriots #Take TheKnee.The
above description of a patriot is not far from that of Samuel Johnson
(1774:21)---*A patriot is always ready to countenance the just claims,
and animate the reasonable hopes of the people; he reminds them,
frequently of their rights, and stimulates them to resent encroachments,
and to multiply securities. \.... He who promises to endeavor, what he
knows his endeavors unable to effect, means only to delude his followers
by an empty clamor or ineffectual zeal.* Furthermore, some suggested
that patriotism should move beyond playing the national anthem before
sports games: "... if fans are going to react so strongly to someone
kneeling during it, as if that somehow signals a blow to America itself,
[it is time to re-evaluate how patriotic the gesture really
is]{.underline}" (Gregory, 2016:18). In summary, kneeling during the
anthem before games has been controversial since Kaepernick started it
as a protest against racial injustice, [but Donald Trump intensified the
flames of controversy with his unpopular "sons of bitches" remarks and
tweets calling fans to boycott games, and **casting a doubt on players'
patriotism.**]{.underline} Peter W. Marty, the publisher of Christian
Century and senior pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Davenport,
Iowa, wrote (Marty, 2017:para 3): [Trump framed the issue as one of
respect for the America flag. **Deploying what might be a new low of
decency in presidential discourse,** he referred to any athlete kneeling
during the anthem as a "son of a bitch" who should be fired\.... Even
more puzzling are the president words implying that patriotism belongs
to those who associate the American flag primarily with the military.
The military doesn't own the American flag, even if military sacrifice
has contributed to its symbolic value.]{.underline}\... Together as a
nation, we give it meaning through the many ways we uphold the
Constitution. Some of those ways even take the form of constitutionally
protected protests. [The devotion that makes for patriotism ought to be
focused less on an inanimate piece of cloth called a flag and more on
the hearts and passions of all kinds of men and women who contribute to
the value behind that symbolic cloth]{.underline}.

#### The rise of fascism in any nation state is always disguised as nationalism and patriotism, with despots commending supporters for their "valiant" efforts in "protecting their values". The moment the nation subscribes to the national identity is the moment the slope falls.

Third, we tend to conflate democratic procedures within a state and
supposed democratic policies by that state. [There is nothing in any
democratic system within a state that could inherently rule out
advancing undemocratic (read as fascist) policies by that
state.]{.underline} The realm of international politics is vastly
detached from the realm of internal national politics. In the United
States, especially, rarely are state officials elected in light of their
agenda for or views on international relations, global politics, or
foreign policies. [For the last one hundred years, elected American
presidents, acting on behalf of the United States, have committed some
of the most racist, totalitarian, imperialist, and exclusionary acts in
the international arena.]{.underline} Donald Trump may be a fascist
leader supported by a fascist base, but the state does not need a
fascist leader to behave as a fascist state on the international stage[.
Trump's second term in the White House will have unique global
significance mainly but not only because of the symbolic and ideological
ramifications in terms of emboldening fascist movements across the world
and rendering fascist mockeries of democracy more widespread in
countries that are already ruled by despotic and fascist
regimes.]{.underline}

The privileged are often fearful of losing their privileges, so the
persecution complex is not uncommon, especially during times of economic
uncertainty. [Fascist ideologues play an essential role in
**intensifying and politicizing the persecution complex among the
lower** middle **class** **and** the **poor** within the majority in
order to further racialize all class problems. There is nothing more
characteristic of the rise of fascism than the racialization of class
politics, **which transforms every potentiality for a socialist
revolution into a race war,** which is of course led by fascists. It is
no wonder that even the liberals in the capitalist class always prefer
fascists over communists. During severe crises, capitalist elites allow
fascists to assume positions of political leadership; without fascist
politics, the social unrest will most likely take the shape of a class
revolution. Fascists, in turn, feed into the persecution complex **and
try everything to spread the belief that the world is fundamentally and
eternally structured on the basis of nations and that great nations
could become miserable in the absence of a wise, fearless, and honest
patriotic leadership.**]{.underline}

The revival of tribal anxieties, such as the sense of being threatened
by the outside world and betrayed by state politicians and elites, gave
rise to a desperate search for a new savior, a father figure who does
not hold back from saying it as it is[, a leader who does not shy away
from standing for family values and national/ racial interests, etc. The
fascist leader presents himself as the **ultimate guardian** who
**protects the great nation that is about to lose its greatness
forever** because of the alleged threats of elimination from without and
decay from within.]{.underline}

**[The nationalist father figure is mandated with a semi-sacred task: to
make it great again, and the rest of the story is fascism
unfolding.]{.underline}** The following fascist pattern is universal
from the beginning to the last stages. First, during the first years of
the savior's reign, a degree of growth in the national economy may be
achieved. [In this stage, there is also a **substantial increase in the
exhibition of national strength**, often **through** deploying forms of
bullying and **intimidation**,]{.underline} directly reflecting the
leader's own personality, against the most disempowered both within the
country and regionally. These perceived victories result in the second
stage: more popularity for the leader, who in turn gains more confidence
in his own wisdom and way of governance. [Within a few years, the father
figure becomes adamant that his historical role is a metaphysically
determined mission]{.underline}. In the third stage, the absolutism
reaches its ultimate peak, whereby [the leader becomes the nation, and
the nation becomes the leader]{.underline}. He treats his hallucinations
as pure visions freshly revealed to him by a divine power, and the
fascist ingratiators who surround him act as if that is the case. If the
leader has a bad dream due to, say, overindulging, the following day the
visionary dream could be converted into an executive order of some sort.

[Once the nationalist mission that is executed under the leadership of
the savior becomes a divine plan, no amount of failure will deter him
from going ahead with his plan and seeing it through to the end to make
the nation great again.]{.underline} In the fourth and last stage, the
destruction has already begun and will not stop until the savior is
physically removed from the scene. Every single time, the one who is
mandated to make it great again will only succeed in destroying it
again. American fascism will continue to have devastating implications
worldwide, rendering ant-fascist education, among other things, in the
United States and the rest of the world urgently needed.

### Settler colonialism

#### The most brutal instances of anti black nationalism exist at the level of spatialized fungibility. The entanglement of slavery and colonialism exist similarly as the nessicacy fuel for the modern climate of political hostility -- these two impossible structures are entangled through modernity\'s reliance on their ability to produce themselves as a form of spatialized dispossession. This production of modernity's space is reliant on a logic of severing native and black persons from their geographies through natal alienation and the logics of re-settling native land.

**Byrd 19.** Jodi A. Byrd. Spring 2019. "Weather with You: Settler
Colonialism, Antiblackness, and the Grounded Relationalities of
Resistance". University of Minnesota Press. // mars

Over the course of the past two years---with debates raging about the
removal of Confederate statues, [with white supremacists marching in the
streets chanting "you will not replace us," 1 and with uninterrupted and
daily ongoing police harassment, violence, and
killings---]{.underline}t[he implications for understanding how
antiblackness and settler colonialism are indivisible feel more urgent
than ever]{.underline}. Even if we all agree that such implications and
urgencies are fundamentally nothing new in the long durée of conquest
that has defined the Americas since 1492, it seems to me that [how we
spatialize and theorize now, in the wake of slavery and genocide, has
lived consequences for how we enact solidarities across disparate
histories and geographies, embody resistances at the intersections of
identities, and imagine futures outside the colonial registers of
possession and dispossession.]{.underline} And yet [it also seems to me
that one of the hardest conversations to have at the moment is the one
that centers Blackness and Indigeneity at the heart of U.S.
empire]{.underline}. **[There remains a glancing away, an uncomfortable
refusal, a too easy gesture of presumed affiliation and equivalency, or
a persistent recentering of whiteness that intrudes.]{.underline}** The
possible conversations remain stymied, half-formed, guarded, and weary,
with both sides, as Justin Leroy points out, making claims to an
exceptionalism that seeks absolutions in the origins of violence.
[**"Either colonialism or slavery," he writes, "must be subordinated to
the other, forcing them into aporetic tension." Neither alone,** Leroy
continues, **can "fully account for the historical messiness of Black
and Indigenous encounters with one another and with the US
state."**]{.underline} What if, he asks, "scholars suspended---even
momentarily---such claims in order to consider the impasse of settlement
and slavery using historical methods?" But I wonder if it is historical
methods alone that are the problem in resolving the impasse. Outside the
theoretical jargon of our highly specialized academic fields, **[racism
and colonialism often continue to function as synonyms, and as settler
colonialism gains traction as an "ism" listed in a chain of oppressions,
it is not entirely clear that, for all those doing the listing,
colonialism in North America is understood as anything other than an
afterlife metaphor for something that might have happened at some point
in time to make the present possible. Less clear is whether those
listing the "isms" understand themselves within the spatialization of
that colonialism as the precise ground of an ongoing U.S. occupation of
Indigenous territoriality.]{.underline}** In the ascendency of what many
are now calling the settler colonial turn, **[Indigeneity can often be
lost, or incompletely apprehended]{.underline}**, even within the
emphases on structures over events that capture all subject positions
within empire. At the same time, **[Blackness, too, is lost, and as
Jared Sexton reminds us, "Slavery as the conversion of person into
property would simply be an extreme form of colonization. Or, vice
versa, colonization would be an attenuated form of
slavery."]{.underline}**3 So perhaps Leroy is right and the problem
resides in how history disciplines us into methodologically producing
evidence and fact to prove a point at a moment when truth no longer
exists. But I continue t**[o think there might also be something in the
slippages inherent in identity politics, positionality, and the ranking
of oppressions that have us collapsing distinctions for expediency
within the necessities of rapid mobilization.]{.underline}** In
returning to Black feminism and the Combahee River Collective, for
instance, we are left to ponder to make correct this core axiom: "If
black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be
free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the
systems of oppression."4 Coming out of queer feminist-of-color
antiracist organizing in the Midwest in the early nineties, one of the
things I had wanted to do in Transit of Empire was to **[pry apart the
taken-for-grantedness of the causality between racism and colonialism,
to spatialize and disturb slightly the recursive assumption that empire
racializes to colonize and that it colonizes because it has already
racialized.]{.underline}** Such **[distinctions seemed necessary to make
legible the colonization of Indigenous lands and peoples at a moment
when multicultural inclusion into the United States as redress for
historical wrongs was in full ascendancy]{.underline}**. To show, in
other words, that [**American Indian nations were literally colonized in
the formal sense theorized by anticolonial and postcolonial scholars**
("I want my land back," as Audra Simpson might say) and **were exactly
governmental polities external to the United States in the face of the
oft-repeated assumption that claims to Indigenous nationhood,
territoriality, and sovereignty were somehow aspirational or rhetorical
or performative gestures of a refusing exceptional claim made by yet
another racial and ethnic minority within.**]{.underline} At the center
of Transit was the impasse of settlement and slavery, and though I
pointed to an origin in the onset of conquest with European arrival, it
was not to make a singular originary claim. The goal was to try to find
a way to hold two truths in cacophonous balance: **[U.S. modernity was
created through the genocide of Indigenous peoples and the seizure of
Indigenous lands, and U.S. modernity was created through chattel
slavery]{.underline}**. There is a reason why Christina Sharpe, when
arguing that "antiblackness is pervasive as climate" also asserts that
"[the ongoing state-sanctioned legal and extralegal murders of Black
people are normative and, for this so-called democracy, necessary: it is
the ground we walk on. And that it is the ground lays out that, and
perhaps how, we might begin to live in relation to this requirement for
our death . . . What happens when we proceed as if we know this,
antiblackness, to be the ground on which we stand, the ground from which
we attempt to speak, for instance, an 'I' or a 'we' who know, an 'I' or
a 'we' who care?"]{.underline}6 **[Ground is power, and settler
colonialism structures its power through anti--
Blackness;]{.underline}** yet the problem remains in that there are
simultaneous, multiple, and nested grounds from which we speak, know,
and care. While Sexton might advocate "no ground for identity, no ground
to stand (on)" in his rebuttal to Indigenous studies, the fact remains
that it is the actual ground itself that is **[the ground through which
Indigenous peoples know our pasts, presents, and futures as relational
and as pedagogical]{.underline}**. As Suzan Shown Harjo stated in a 2011
Committee on Indian Affairs Senate hearing on the impact of racist
stereotypes on Indigenous peoples, "This is our country in a way that it
is no one else's country, because no one brought any land here with
them."8 Having spent my years in graduate school thinking with
postcolonial scholars from the Caribbean and the Global South to
understand Chickasaws from lands that became Mississippi as part of an
ongoing conversation about souths, I was particularly interested in
theorizing the messiness of a form of a durative, ongoing colonialism
that was enacted in the Americas through conscription, constraint,
forced diasporas, and slavery, in what Lisa Lowe has theorized as the
intimacies of four continents. **[How we can ever know freedom, Lowe
tell us, is always already entangled in the violences of land
dispossession, genocide, indentureship, and chattel slavery.9
I]{.underline}**n his response to Patrick Wolfe's Traces of History,
entitled colonialism transform when read through Cedric Robinson, Peter
Linebaugh, and Lowe: "**[Taken together, they reveal how the system of
extracting surplus emerged within a logic of racial hierarchy and racial
subjugation that dragged Africans, Asians, and 'Europeans'
proletarianized by enclosure to the lands of the Americas, Australia /
New Zealand, parts of South Asia and Africa, and the eastern
Mediterranean---where Indigenous peoples were dispossessed, enslaved, or
exploited by other means]{.underline}**."10 Drawing on Kamau Brathwaite,
Wilson Harris, Grace Nichols, Gayatri Spivak, C. L .R. James, and Paul
Gilroy, and in counterpoint to the cast of white settler scholars from
the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand intent on
recentering themselves as the fulcrum of empire and colonialism, [I
resisted naming the cacophonies of new-world colonialism settler
colonialism and instead theorized arrivant colonialism as a way to
account for the global contours of racialized gendered capitalism that
deploys uneven and enforced precarity to interpellate voluntary and
conscript involuntary participation into the structures predicated upon
Indigenous dispossession and transatlantic]{.underline} slavery. Sourced
through Brathwaite's new world trilogy that includes the collections
Rights of Passage, Islands, and Masks, the word "arrivant," for me,
contained within it the violences of the Middle Passage as well as
African Indigeneity through its citational genealogy and epigraph from a
Kumina Queen in Jamaica: "Well, muh ol' arrivance . . . is from Africa .
. . That's muh ol' arrivants family."11 In their essay on colonial
unknowing, Manu Vimalassery, Juliana Hu Pegues, and Alyosha Goldstein
suggest that the term "arrivant" might "give us a way to begin thinking
about queer Indigenous phenomenologies," that in the shift from
arrivance to arrivant in the Kumina Queen's epigraph, "we might connect
Brathwaite to Gerald Vizenor's idea of survivance, which names
indigeneity as an active presence and continuation, rather than loss
alone."12 It was not, in other words, an attempt to create an
identificatory category to claim alongside settler, native, slave,
savage, or settler ally.13 I[t was instead a way to name a process and
make messy the presumed circuits of white supremacist nationalism
underlying certain strands of settler colonial studies that relegate
Indigenous peoples to elimination, refugees to settlers, and descendants
of slaves to settler adjacents.]{.underline}14 In its way, arrivant
colonialism stands in cacophonous tension with Shona Jackson's creole
Indigeneity as two names for oscillating dynamics that grapple with the
desire for landed belonging and its simultaneous (im)possibility that
are exactly the afterlives of slavery and colonialism.15 For Brathwaite,
The Arrivants ends with the poem "Vèvè" and the reference to the opening
of a vodoun ceremony that begins with chalking the "So on this ground, /
write;" the poem commands, and within that vèvè symbol conjures the
fragments and ruins of plunder as well as the possibilities of
possession as a beginning.16 The Kumina Queen that Brathwaite cites in
his epigraph is clear about her sense of ground: "Muh gran'mudda an' muh
gran'fadda. Well, they came out here as slavely . . . you unnerstan'?
Well, when them came now, I doan belongs to Africa, I belongs to
Jamaica. I born here."17 Although for Brathwaite arrivance is a
positionality of active continuance, of active Indigenous conjuring, of
active arrival at a ground of temporal beginning and therefore
possibility in the impossibility of return that brought slaves and Asian
indentured labor to the Americas, Eve Tuck, Allison Guess and Hannah
Sultan observe that "[the word 'arrivants' helps to highlight the
complicity of all arrivants (including Black people) in Indigenous
erasure and dispossession, because settler colonialism 'requires settler
and arrivants to cathect the space of the native as their
home.']{.underline} But 'arrivants' may also conceal the unique
positioning of Blackness in settler colonialism and the complicity of
white people and nonwhite people (including Native people) in
antiblackness."18 But [even further concealed within the unique
positioning of Blackness in settler colonialism is what Kelley observes
as the core problematic of the field through his reading of Patrick
Wolfe.]{.underline} By not incorporating more of the globe into its
field of study, settler colonial studies loses Africa altogether:
"**[African indigeneity is erased in this formulation because, through
linguistic sleight of hand, Africans are turned into Black Americans.
The Atlantic Slave trade rips Africans from their homeland and deposits
them in territories undergoing settlement and dispossession, but
renaming severs any relationship to their land and indigenous
communities]{.underline}**."19 Arrivants was my attempt to ground
relationality to the physical ruptures of land beyond possession and
dispossession and to help us hold and nuance the specificities between
Indigeneity and race, slavery and colonialism, that resulted when 1492
brought the globe to the Americas

[**In trying to theorize an openness beyond the binaries of settler
colonialism and antiblackness** that is accountable to the globe while
attuned to the specificities of place, I find myself still wanting to
move toward a spatialization of simultaneous oppressions that define the
conditions of possibility that make our contemporary now
possible.]{.underline} While Glen Coulthard and Leanne Simpson have been
collaboratively theorizing Indigenous sovereignty and resurgence through
what they ca[ll "**grounded normativity," which includes "ethical
frameworks provided by these Indigenous place-based practices and
associated forms of knowledge," it seems important to consider further
what "ground" and "normativity" actually mean in the context of
antiblackness**]{.underline} Toward that end, I find myself [wanting to
hold ground as Indigenous but also hold ground as relational, to push
against anything that might be deemed normative in gestures that
highlight the processes of removal and arrival, and in them, the
refusals of subjectivity as it has been defined through enlightenment
and imperialism]{.underline}. I **remain committed to a method of
reading power that lets us apprehend the conflicting, oppositional, [and
contradictory vectors of antiblackness within ongoing colonialism to
reveal how the investments of racial capitalism pit oppressions against
each other even as it requires each and every one of those oppressions
to vie for ascendancy as the one truth of
history]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} At the Native American and
Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA), we can see the cacophonies of
oppressions in the organization's circulation of the Israeli
military-designed Waze app in violation of its statement in support of
Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) the same week that the United
States moved its embassy to Jerusalem and over sixty Palestinian men,
women, and children lost their lives in an outright massacre by the
state of Israel.

And at the University of Illinois, [**we can see how antiblackness and
settler colonialism are indivisible at the site of the university's
disastrous handling of a global Indigenous studies program that included
Palestine, and in the lingering racist Chief Illiniwek mascot**, where
**white supremacists use claims to a fraudulent southern confederate
Cherokee Indigeneity to advance antiblackness through evocations of
Indianness and an African American chancellor declares pro-chief people
not racist,**]{.underline} even as [he uses South African models of
truth and reconciliation to attend to the racist chief supporters'
insistences they have been wronged with the removal of their beloved
symbol**. To question the chancellor is to risk engaging in
antiblackness; to challenge the Chief is to be cast as anti-Indian.**
Weathering such a perfect storm requires a large enough frame to see how
the ground itself figures as all struggle for power and legibility and
how,]{.underline} ironically, it is Georgia and not Illinois that
ultimately ends up informing the racial and colonial politics of the
state's flagship institution. For the chancellor, Illinois was a dream
job, and as he states: "I have the land-grant mission in my blood. I am
a product of it. It is what brought me into higher education, from a
sharecropping family in Georgia;" for the southern "Cherokee" white
supremacists, Georgia is the foundational justification for their
playing Indian resentment and Confederate dreams.21 In asserting that
antiblackness is both normative and the ground upon which we walk,
Christina Sharpe's work reminds us that it is not enough to theorize a
return push to reclaim the ground as normatively Indigenous, especially
at a moment when nationalism is white nativism But lost within the
cacophonies of how Illinois has chosen to celebrate its sesquicentennial
anniversary of its founding as a land-grand university are the very
peoples whose lands were taken to stage the debate between South Africa,
Confederate white supremacists, and dancing Chiefs at halftime. In
thinking about the arrivances of colonialism, it is important to hold
the distinctions between land and ground, the normative and the
relational, especially as Indigenous scholars consider the possibilities
of solidarity and resistance where our lands became the grounds for
others' oppressions

### IR/Security 

#### The coherence of the state relies on a politicization and securitization that exists within the afterlifes of arctic racialization and the political mechanisms that produce the tangibility of whiteness as a way that colonial states operate on top of racialized landscapes

**Harrington and Lecavalier 14**, Assistant Professor of International
Relations @ Durham University (Cameron and Emma, \"The environment and
emancipation in critical security studies: the case of the Canadian
Arctic.\" *Critical Studies on Security*, Vol. 2, No. 1)

[Traditional approaches to security generally focus on protection from
perceived threats **through** the use of **power**]{.underline}. [This
translates to the belief that studies of security should conform to the
'real side of politics;' that is, as policy action in an unchanging
international sphere, where **states** are the **only significant
actors** and their relations are naturalized because they are
structurally pre-determined]{.underline} (Hutchings 1999, 28). As
Sinclair (1996, 6) points out, [traditional theory 'assumes the
functional coherence of existing phenomena', meaning that there is
little interest on the part of analysts and practitioners to excavate
the meanings and assumptions of discourse or practice. Instead, problems
are seen to be emblematic of various deficiencies between
actors]{.underline}, usually [a result of misunderstanding]{.underline},
power disparities, or clashing interests. Such approaches to
environmental security are on vivid display in a Canadian context, which
holds generalizable assumptions about who is to be secured and from what
threats. Evidently, [the referent object is the state. The environmental
threats that are often highlighted and reinforced in official and
academic discourse are varied, containing both domestic and foreign
elements. They include the **struggle** to **control shipping
routes**]{.underline} from a newly opened Northwest Passage (DFAIT
2013b), the need to **[protect]{.underline}** abundant **[energy
supplies]{.underline}** (Senate of Canada 2012), and the [potential for
environmental activists to block and/or sabotage government and
corporate interests]{.underline} (Public Safety Canada 2011; Payton
2012; Leahy 2013; Freeze 2013). All told, [these traditional
interpretations of environmental security]{.underline} in Canada display
continued traction within both historical and contemporary official
discourse. Crucially, they [rely upon an understanding of the natural
environment that confirms and abides a homogenous vision of security,
whereby the **state** is the **referent object of
protection**]{.underline}, and [the **natural environment exists to be**
managed, controlled, **exploited**, and preserved at the behest of
perceived national interests]{.underline}. The resultant effects are
important for not only a deeper understanding of the ways in which
hazards are judged, but also the ways in which the Welsh School stands
to benefit from incorporating an ecological point of view into its
programme of emancipatory politics. There is no greater illustration of
the intersubjective construction of Canadian environmental security than
in excavating the familiar trope of Canada as [The Great White
North]{.underline}. This [**narrative is pivotal** in]{.underline} the
**[ongoing securitization of the Arctic region]{.underline}** in Canada.
The **[region]{.underline}** has [persistently been treated as a
military object, and as a source of both pride and
vulnerability]{.underline}. It was largely ignored by defence officials
until after the Second World War, when it witnessed a 'variety of
attempts, some relatively minor, others extraordinarily ambitious, to
overcome what was perceived to be an antagonistic environment'
(Lackenbauer and Farish 2007, 923). During the Cold War, Arctic Canada
held important geopolitical significance as a bulwark separating an
expansionary Soviet Union from the North American industrial heartland
(Lackenbauer and Farish 2007, 923). In 1946, Lester B. Pearson, then
Canadian Ambassador to the United States, published an article called
'Canada looks "down north"', in Foreign Affairs, which outlined a vision
of the Canadian north as the strategic heart of the country, and perhaps
even the continent. He proclaimed that Canada, like Russia, is looking
to the North as a land of the future. The reason is obvious. The war and
the aeroplane have driven home to Canadians the importance of their
Northland, in strategy, in resources, and in communications. We should
no longer be deceived by flat maps and 'frigid wasteland' tales of our
public school geographies. (Pearson 1946, 638) For Pearson, and for
subsequent Canadian governments, [the expansion of sovereign control
over vast swaths of seemingly uncharted, uninhabited land with abundant
resources compelled a heavy emphasis on the ways in which the
**environment** could be harnessed and **utilized** for national
**security**.]{.underline} John Diefenbakers's election victory in 1958
was largely based on his northern vision of development. In one of his
most oft-cited speeches, he proclaimed: This national Development Policy
will create a new sense of National Purpose and National Destiny. One
Canada! One Canada, wherein Canadians will have preserved to them the
control of their own economic and political destiny. Sir John A.
Macdonald gave his life to this Party. He opened the West. He saw Canada
from East to West. I see a new Canada -- a Canada of the North.
(Diefenbaker 1958) Diefenbaker's northern vision, his 'roads to
resources' policy, was instrumental in advancing significant
infrastructure projects in the Arctic. Since then, similar [sentiments
about]{.underline} Canada's destiny to [the Arctic]{.underline} [have
retained a high degree of resonance and power for politicians eager to
assert the sovereign duty]{.underline} of Canadian officials [to
discover, accumulate, and preserve the riches provided by the abundant
resource base]{.underline}, lest they be lost to competing interests, or
left forever untapped. In contemporary times, [the onset of climate
change, shifting geopolitical priorities, and continuing energy needs,
has re-activated the security connections with the Arctic.]{.underline}
The region is undergoing a series of significant transformations, which
have been identified by Prime Minister Stephen Harper as a national
priority. In 2008, he invoked the spirit of John Diefenbaker in a major
policy address to audiences in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. He
proclaimed that Prime Minister Diefenbaker is no longer with us, but the
geopolitical importance of the Arctic and Canada\'s interests in it have
never been greater. This is why our government has launched an ambitious
Northern Agenda based on the timeless responsibility imposed by our
national anthem, to keep the True North strong and free .... We will
protect the unique and fragile Arctic ecosystem for the generations yet
to come. And of course, we will assert and defend Canada\'s sovereignty
and security in this region. (Harper 2008) The three central documents
detailing Canada's current Arctic policy are the 2008 Canada First
Defence Strategy (National Defence \[Canada\], 2008), the 2009 Northern
Strategy (Indian and Northern Affairs \[Canada\]), and the 2010
document, Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy (DFAIT 2010). Together the
three documents represent an aggressive expression of national
sovereignty and security in the far North. The Arctic Foreign Policy
proclaims 'the first and most important pillar towards recognizing the
potential of Canada's Arctic is the exercise of our sovereignty over the
far north' (DFAIT 2010, 5). Indeed, Prime Minister Harper declared the
protection and promotion of Canadian sovereignty over the Arctic 'a
non-negotiable priority' (CBC News 2010). All three documents illustrate
the government's priorities of 'exercising sovereignty; promoting
economic and social development; protecting \[our\] environmental
heritage; and improving and devolving Northern governance' (Indian and
Northern Affairs \[Canada\] 2009). [These priorities have been
reinforced by ongoing security manoeuvres that increase state control
over the farthest reaches of its territory. In the form of material
expression, security is being claimed via the utilization of military
ice-breakers; patrol ships; the creation of a new deep water port in
Nanisivik, Nunavut (Harper 2007a); the deployment of military personnel
including the Northern Rangers (Lackenbauer 2004--2005); and the
undertaking of joint military operations with other Arctic countries
under Operation Cold Response and Operation Nanook. As Wilfrid Greaves
writes, 'Canada's approach to Arctic security remains preoccupied with
traditional, state-centric military threats, despite the fact that all
three documents explicitly specify that **no** such military **threats
exist'**]{.underline} (Greaves 2011, 230). Adding complexity is the fact
that, in May 2013, Canada assumed the two-year Chairmanship of the
Arctic Council, the leading intergovernmental body of Arctic nations.
The government's highlighted priorities include 'responsible resource
development', 'safe Arctic shipping', 'sustainable circumpolar
communities', and 'strengthening the Arctic Council' (DFAIT, 2013a).
These priorities have been identified as part of a larger strategy to
maintain northern control in the face of growing competition for oil and
mineral wealth located in the Arctic. The Chairwoman of the Council,
Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq proclaimed, 'We must remember
that the Arctic Council was formed by Northerners, for Northerners, long
before the region was of interest to the rest of the world' (quoted in
Koring 2013). Effectively, [the results are that traditional
**interpretations of security** are being **transposed** onto the
**physical geography of the Arctic** region]{.underline} through
official Canadian discourse[. In other words, something labelled
'security' is being written on the body of the Earth via discursive and
material practices. Recent announcements by Harper have described
government investments in the region as necessary for unlocking the
north's 'potential' and the 'national destiny']{.underline} (Harper
2009), for discovering buried resource 'treasures' (Harper 2007a), and
for managing the vast, seemingly endless 'frontier' (Harper 2012). 3 The
result is that the state has been able to assert traditional means of
control over the natural environment of the far north. Concurrently, the
natural environment conditions Canadian security. [Official discourse
has frequently incorporated the region's 'remoteness' into a vision of
security where **physical enemies** and **logical uncertainties** are
forever **lurking** and where **unfulfilled opportunities
abound**]{.underline}. Both the environment and Canadian security itself
becomes constructed by mantras of sovereign control, ownership, and
exclusion, which in the face of rapidly increasing climate change and
resultant environmental changes, provides ample contradiction. Harper
proclaimed in 2007 that: Canada has a choice when it comes to defending
our sovereignty over the arctic. We either use it or lose it. And make
no mistake, this Government intends to use it. Because Canada's Arctic
is central to our national identity as a northern nation. It is part of
our history. And it represents the tremendous potential of our future.
(Harper 2007b) Such statements are reflective of the powerful effects
that the environment holds in traditional security discourse. Government
speeches offer lessons on the ways in which interpretations of the
vastness of geography, the spectre of resource abundance, and the
preoccupation with control over nature can stimulate security logics.
Lawrence Cannon, then minister of foreign affairs, proclaimed to a UK
audience in 2010 that Canada was an 'Arctic Nation', an 'Arctic power',
and that the 'Arctic and the North are part of our national identity'
(Cannon 2010). Such rhetoric effectively demonstrates 'the ways in which
"The North" is imagined as a space of national pride, belonging, and
exploration: a space that is alternately normalized as a fundamental
extension of state territory and exoticized as a distant wilderness to
be conquered' (Steinberg 2010, 81). Visions of the environment continue
to be deeply implicated in the writing of Canadian identity and in the
operation of Canadian politics. The idea of The Great White North
defines the nation's security interests -- who is to be secured, what
way of life protected. The invocation of [The Great White North denotes
the natural environment as an important source of economic value and a
salient frame for conceptualizing international
geopolitics.]{.underline}

### Eco-catastrophe 

#### The Arctic is entering the minds of the West as a site for extraction when films depict themes of eco-catastrophe- Critical reflections of the Arctic are key to shape aesthetics and global futures in relation to the Arctic. 

**Carden**, J., **2018**. *The Black Body in Arctic Space: Revisioning
Racialised Landscapes in the Films of John Akomfrah and Isaac Julien*

Future Orientations:[Writing this future-facing chapter not only led me
to formalise my thinking on the respective film's temporal disjunctions
and how meditations on time have carved new forms of agency for
non-white narratives, but it also led me to further consider the
timeliness of this thesis. As I have underscored throughout this body of
research, the themes which *The Nine Muses* and *True North*raise are
pertinent to current cultural and political discourses, particularly in
relation to the political ecologies of the Arctic, whiteness and the
emergent field of Afrofuturism.What is significant to consider at this
final juncture are the dates that *The Nine Muses* and *True North* were
produced. Despite being fourteen years since the release of *True North*
in 2004, and eight since *The Nine Muses* in 2010, I propose the
artworks are more significant now than when they were initially
released. As my research for this thesis developed over time, so too has
the significance of the respective films. There are two interconnected
reasons for this.]{.underline} Firstly, as I emphasised earlier in this
concluding chapter, from the year 2000 the Arctic experienced an
unprecedented shift in its identity. In line with this, as identified by
[Wilson in his book *The Spiritual History of Ice*]{.underline}, between
the years of 1997--2001 t[here was a burst of Western polar fiction
depicting themes of ecological catastrophe and its effects on
humankind]{.underline} (Wilson, 2003). With [the Arctic beginning to
enter Western public consciousness as a key site for global
futures,]{.underline} the artworks can be read as [responses to this
emerging cultural and political Arctic awareness.]{.underline} However,
[since the production of the films, environmental health has
consistently deteriorated, and landgrabs alongside advances to extract
resources have intensified, resulting in the region sitting at the
centre of ideological, political, cultural and environmental
conflict.]{.underline} Now more than ever, [critical reflections of the
Arctic are necessary to determine global futures.]{.underline} My second
reason for proposing that the films are more pertinent now is their
focus on racial whiteness. As argued in chapter four, *Invisible to
Whom: Representations of Whiteness*, [since the emergence of Akomfrah's
*The Nine Muses* in 2010, Euro-American politics have continued to veer
to the right, creating preoccupations with notions of nationalism,
belonging and racial purity.]{.underline} The respective events of
[Brexit and]{.underline} the inauguration of the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [have escalated right-wing politics in populist culture
and provided legitimisation for white supremacist ideologies as they
play out in Western society through racism, inequality and
injustice.]{.underline}

### Strange Fruit/Black Pain Commodification

#### The lynchings of black citizens was a joyous show for white Americans that produced bodily trophies. 

**Morris** and Lartey **18.** Jamiles Lartey. Sam Morris. Aug 26, 2018.
"How white Americans used lynchings to terrorize and control black
people"
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/lynchings-memorial-us-south-montgomery-alabama
// mars

[**Among the most unsettling realities of lynching is the degree to
which white Americans embraced it,** **not as an uncomfortable necessity
or a way of maintaining order, but as a joyous moment of wholesome
celebration.**]{.underline} "[**Whole families came together,** mothers
and fathers, **bringing even their youngest children**.]{.underline} It
was the show of the countryside -- a very popular show," read a 1930
editorial in the Raleigh News and Observer. **"[Men joked loudly at the
sight of the bleeding body ... girls giggled as the flies fed on the
blood that dripped from the Negro's nose.]{.underline}**["]{.underline}
Adding to the macabre nature of the scene, **[lynching victims were
typically dismembered into pieces of human trophy for mob
members]{.underline}**. In his autobiography, WEB Du Bois writes of the
1899 lynching of Sam Hose in Georgia. [He reports that **the knuckles of
the victim were on display at a local store on Mitchell Street in
Atlanta and that a piece of the man's heart and liver was presented to
the state's governor**.]{.underline} In the 1931 Maryville, Missouri,
lynching of Raymond Gunn, the crowd estimated at 2,000 to 4,000 was at
least a quarter women, and included hundreds of children. **[One woman
"held her little girl up so she could get a better view of the naked
Negro blazing on the roof",]{.underline}** wrote [Arthur Raper in The
Tragedy of
Lynching](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Tragedy_of_Lynching.html?id=d5u9z7tewuUC).
After the fire was out, hundreds poked about in his ashes for souvenirs.
"The charred remains of the victim were divided piece by piece," wrote
Raper.

#### Activities involving Blackface, such as minstrel shows, provided economic and social benefits for the white population. 

**Butler 18.** John Scott Butler. 11 May 2018. "A Darkened Past: The
Role of Blackface Minstrelry in Forming the Columbia Community". // mars

While female students at Teachers College exercised a significant level
of agency in these instances, women at Columbia more often occupied the
seats, rather than the stage. Historian Susan Smulyan asserts that this
more conventional role for women as members of the audience was one of
the primary motivators for college men to stage amateur minstrel shows.
She argues that ["**camaraderie and a chance to meet the opposite sex
remained at the heart of all amateur theatricals and proved an important
factor**]{.underline} in the choice to present a minstrel show rather
than something else since [minstrel shows involved simple performances
requiring minimal rehearsal and thus **allowed more time for socializing
than more complex productions**]{.underline}**."** In the April 31, 1878
show, it was noted that "the little theatre was about two-thirds full,
and the audience was mainly composed of ladies." A New York Times report
of a performance for the Columbia College Baseball Association staged on
February 9, 1889 even provides a list of the "ladies present."38 [**The
reliance on blackness as a pejorative source of entertainment**, as well
as a forum **for the creation of otherness further demonstrates how the
male student population at Columbia relied on racism to foster a
community amongst themselves, as well as with women.**]{.underline}
Nevertheless, the wide scope of students and alumni performing and
observing shows demonstrates how the Columbia identity was truly
influenced by the minstrel show, as virtually any member of the Columbia
community could partake in the fun in some capacity. In addition to
uniting current and past students in their shared white middle to upper
class identity, [minstrel shows also served a more tangible purpose as
fundraisers.]{.underline} Col[lecting funds was a hallmark of the
amateur minstrel show across the country,]{.underline} demonstrated in
one amateur guide book written by Arthur LeRoy Kaser, a renowned amateur
minstrel show author. In one guide, Kaser assures that ["**putting on a
show ... remains one of the surest methods of raising funds for almost
anything.**]{.underline}" While the proceeds of [amateur minstrel shows
were most often given to charitable organizations,]{.underline} Columbia
[**minstrel shows benefited athletic teams above all other student
organizations**.]{.underline} This meant that [performing student groups
coordinated with athletic groups to put on a show, **further
exemplifying that shows developed a more unified College community from
planning to performing**.]{.underline} In a show staged by the Columbia
College Glee Club on April 31, 1878, the crew team received the total
amount collected of three hundred dollars for the purpose of sending a
boat to the Henley Regatta.40 A February 8, 1889 show occurred to
provide funding for the Base-Ball Association, in which student
organizers hoped "that all Columbia men \[would\] lend their aid,

#### White communities see black violence as an opportunity to sexualize black bodies rather than protesting the state-sanctioned violence occurring.

**[When Black men do appear in Laaksonen's pieces, they're nearly always
an accessory to white desire.]{.underline}** One seared in my memory
depicts a white man being assaulted by four Black men. Another shows a
Black man being belt-whipped by two white men. As scholar Franklin
Howard explains, "[Tom sexualized potential police brutality and
visually represented the social imbalance of power in his erotic art.
**Black men cannot even pleasure each other without the presence of
white man."**]{.underline} A clear example that Howard cites is Tom's
Untitled (1988), [a drawing where two cops bend a Black man over the
hood of a police car while one prepares to penetrate him.]{.underline}
There's only [s**o much point to assigning ethics to erotica, but at the
same time, when compounded with the ongoing conversation on
state-sanctioned violence... yikes**]{.underline}**.** But the
[c**ommodification of Black fetishism among supposed "radicals" remains
timeless.** Both **Laaksonen and these protesters with sex-centered
signs place Blackness in a prop position while whiteness remains the
star.**]{.underline} Still, Laaksonen is no Robert Mapplethorpe, the
late, "edgy" homoerotic photographer. Mapplethorpe's faceless,
crotch-fixed photos of Black men in the 1980s are probably the best case
study for art that speaks to today's dick-crazed protest posters. His
1980 photograph "Man in Polyester Suit" is famously controversial for
its exposure of the Black subject's penis out of the fly of dress pants.
The piece has become the blueprint for shenanigans of this flavor.
Mapplethorpe went for it to the point that Milton Moore, the subject of
"Man in Polyester Suit" and many other photographs, is believed to have
once said he felt primitive beneath Mapplethorpe's gaze: **["I think he
saw me like a monkey in a zoo.]{.underline}"** [Sometimes I think that
my penis --- if magically granted autonomy to leap off my body and live
its own life --- might be valued more highly and by more people than my
entire being. **Black body parts are always profitable.** But once our
voices and brains get too involved, **attempts to edit or silence us are
never far off.** That's the simple truth for Black people enduring
racial capitalism.]{.underline}

### Critical Inquiry

#### Afrofuturism is key - Critical qualitative inquiry and collection of knowledge is necessary precursor for activism and policy revisionism

**Eseonu and Okoye 23,** Temidayo Eseonu and Florence Okoye, September 1
2023, "Making a Case for Afrofuturism as a Critical Qualitative Inquiry
Method for Liberation" 'Taylor and Francis',
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10999922.2023.2251277 //sul

[As a critical qualitative inquiry, Afrofuturism ensures that prominence
is given to Black peo-ple's knowledge and uses research to reveal sites
for change and activism, ensuring that these groups\' visions are shared
with and acted on by policymakers]{.underline} (Denzin, 2017). In
[understanding the present to imagine possibilities for the future,
Afrofuturism prefers to consult with and take direction from various
bodies of information before taking action or forming
conclusion]{.underline}s on futures (Rockeymoore, 2000). The knowledge
generated becomes lived theory as a form of empirical evidence. [Lived
theory emerges from seeking to answer problems on the ground through a
contextualisation of a problem]{.underline} in the larger scheme of
things; the answers are immersed in the facts on the ground (Sivanandan
in Gordon, 2014, pp. 4--5). Therefore, [Afrofuturism, as a method in
critical qualitative inquiry for public service design, considers the
individual experience and the "structural contexts, power arrangements,
and collective ideologies" that impact Black communities]{.underline}
(Charmaz, 2017, p. 35)

### Research 

#### Whiteness functions as the standard of research and practice, a currency that racializes the superhuman politics of indigenous persons that contrasts the politics of incivility created through the 'pure' legal religious standards forced onto the Arctic. 

**Stuhl 16**, Associate professor of environmental studies and sciences
at Bucknell University. (Andrew, *Unfreezing the Arctic: Science,
Colonialism, and the Transformation of Inuit Lands*, Introduction: "Is
the Arctic Out of Time, pg. 2-3, published 2016, RC)

We start with [scientists]{.underline}. Their [concepts and research
practices have accompanied efforts to conquer, cajole, civilize,
capitalize, consume, and conserve the far north since the late
1800s]{.underline}. It may feel odd for some readers to link the pursuit
of truths about the natural world with colonialism, especially in such a
sparsely populated zone. But [reflect for a moment on the most popular
chapter of Arctic history: the search for the North Pole. As historians
have deftly shown, American, Danish, and Norwegian explorers scoured the
Arctic Ocean at the turn of the twentieth century not simply to seek out
adventure but to find the world's remaining unclaimed
lands]{.underline}. [They returned south as national heroes because they
expanded their home country's territorial possessions]{.underline}.
[**Redrawing maps to display their discoveries**, they sprinkled the
names of sponsors on bays, islands, straits, and narrows. In these
material ways, **explorers extended Euro-American authority over the
Arctic**.]{.underline}3 [Like their maps, **explorers' tales about an
Arctic terra incognita and savage Inuit helped southerners claim the
north.**]{.underline} [With their words, they painted the Arctic as
isolated and inhospitable]{.underline}. At times, [they portrayed Inuit
communities as backward for relying on Stone Age technologies for
survival and primitive because they appeared to know neither religion
nor law]{.underline}. [In other instances, Inuit were
strong---superhuman, even---for subsisting in an environment without
trees, warmth, or readily accessible game]{.underline}. Historians
analyze these depictions of the Arctic in relation to when they were
produced and the dramas playing out at that time. [**Explorers'
narratives were products of metropolitan societies concerned with the
effects of overcivilization**, a softness emerging from the urban
existence that replaced life on the farm over the end of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}. [Those who consumed scientific ideas measured the
Arctic against the norms of the Euro-American experience, reifying that
experience as superior.]{.underline} [An exotic place, one uninfluenced
by machines and morality, then, was not an objective observation, but a
view through imperial eyes]{.underline}.4 The ways historians have
unpacked polar exploration illustrates the conceptual framework of this
book. That is, [**scientific representations of Arctic nature are
entangled with human interventions in the region**. A map of the North
Pole in 1909 was not an exact reproduction of the physical environment
of coastlines and ocean currents. Instead, it was a document born from
particular field experiences in particular places and widely held
desires for global dominance.]{.underline} Philosopher Ian Hacking puts
it this way: "Science is said to have two aims: theory and experiment.
Theories try to say how the world is. Experiment and subsequent
technology change the world. We represent and we intervene. We represent
in order to intervene, and we intervene in light of our
representations." Perhaps readers already understand this relationship
intuitively, given the adage "knowledge is power."[**5 Polar exploration
is just one example of the pursuit of knowledge converging with colonial
ambition in the Arctic.** Ideas of nature changed over time. New
paradigms pushed researchers to ask different questions about the north
just as human activity there altered the environment, requiring
continued analysis]{.underline}. I use the term scientist to refer to an
unwieldy group of people, from museum-based naturalists in the late
1800s to geophysicists working for military agencies during World War II
to ecologists translating research into political activism in the 1960s.
The differences among them are many, but what they share is this: at the
moment they appear in this book, they compete for the mantle on
definitive questions of scientific understanding, natural resource
management, and national development. In these ways, [the
nineteenth-century specimen collector inhabits a social and intellectual
space similar to the climate scientist today. By bringing these
practitioners together in this way, we thread diverse representations
and interventions in different historical periods in a line---thus
reconnecting the Arctic's colonial past with its present.6]{.underline}

#### Misogynoir infiltrates research practices black women are constantly stolen from within academic settings in blatant ways.

Moya **Bailey & Trudy 2018** "On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and
plagiarism" feminist media studies

//BucKy

[I experience an almost immeasurable amount of plagiarism for many years
now, including of my years of work theorizing on misogynoir. Since I am
an unaffiliated writer---or in other words, I write independently and
without mainstream media, academic or corporate support and without the
accompanying social status, yet I have an extremely visible presence in
social media spaces---I face the phenomenon of people plagiarizing my
work in very public and grotesque ways.]{.underline} People who do this
know that since I am without institutional support and resources, they
will face no repercussions. [While social status cannot prevent
plagiarism, it often determines if the person plagiarized will have any
emotional support and resources for recourse. I have very little of the
former and none of the latter, when it comes to dealing with
plagiarism.]{.underline} I experience two types of plagiarism, which in
my writing I refer to as opportunistic plagiarism and punitive
plagiarism. Opportunistic plagiarists use my writing and tweets without
citation to meet journalistic and academic deadlines, whether for pay,
social status (as misogynoir guarantees anyone socially/economically
"above" an [unaffiliated Black woman will be praised for the things
Black women theorize and write), or both. Punitive plagiarists can be
opportunistic as well, but they are also interested in punishing me for
my work. Punitive plagiarists do not only want the opportunities they
can gain through exploiting me,]{.underline} but FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
5 they are also interested in erasing my labor altogether. Often times,
this looks like someone mentioning that Moya coined "misogynoir," but
then they plagiarize my actual theorization work. While the
opportunistic plagiarist does not consider me important enough to cite,
the punitive plagiarist is concerned with both opportunism and erasure,
in a personal way. At times, these are people who know me online and
will even go as far to say that I "inspire" them, but ultimately are
harmful because there is social capital in knowing what Black women do,
without being a Black woman. Many spaces and publications, both indie
and mainstream, either reduce my years of work to a single essay of mine
or erase my work altogether (2014). [When I wrote that particular essay
in 2014, I did not do so as a journalist who learned a new word but as
someone who had been theorizing and developing a framework for how
misogynoir is even defined and understood, especially so outside of the
academe. In other words, primarily Moya and I are why journalists,
activists and others can even write on misogynoir at all. Because of the
social status ascribed to mainstream media, their words are held over
mine. This hierarchy that facilitates the conditions for plagiarism and
erasure that I experience around my theorizing on misogynoir ironically
reflects how misogynoir functions in social and institutional
settings.]{.underline}

#### Black women's labor is constantly co-opted and used to produce white scholarship.

//BucKy

So how did everyone else benefit? Well for starters, I learned from
several individuals who shared my article with their audiences on social
media that *they* were invited to be guests on several podcasts,
[offered paid speaking engagements and served on panel
discussions]{.underline}. I found this interesting because these
individuals were either Black men or white women who had **NOTHING --
not a damn thing** to do with the article I wrote except sharing it on
social media. [Those who invited them to participate in these events had
gone to MY website to read My article]{.underline}, [which clearly has a
way to connect with Me for media appearances and speaking
engagements]{.underline}. Interesting. *I know,* [right? One individual
redirected the organization requesting his presence back to me and they
told him "No]{.underline}*, we want you*," of which he declined because
he wasn't versed in the subject matter. Another individual used my
article as the basis of a training program for mental health clinicians
at a university, yet no one asked my permission or for my input.
Instead, I was tagged on LinkedIn as they announced the program to the
public. [So all of these individuals gained significant exposure and
some had monetary gains too]{.underline}, simply by sharing my article,
tagging me in their social media posts and then crossing their fingers,
[hoping and praying I would engage]{.underline}, [comment and like their
sharing of my work]{.underline}. [Yet I basically walked away with
nothing compared to what they gained in return. I also began to realize
that when I commented on the LinkedIn posts of Black men and White women
they were going viral]{.underline}. [The posts would have nothing to do
with Brene Brown]{.underline}, but instead diverse topics that focused
on sexism, ageism or discrimination in the workplace. [One Black male
saw how my presence on his post impacted his audience engagement on
LinkedIn with over 20K views and over 5K people liking and
commenting]{.underline}. [He took it upon himself to reach out to me via
DM and ask if I would use MY platform and have him as a guest on MY
LinkedIn Live and how much of a great team WE would make]{.underline}.
That's when I had to pump the brakes; *"hold the hell up!*" Although I
wrote this great think piece, [no one really wanted to hear from a Black
woman who actually has an opinion and]{.underline} (gasp) thinks. [I
realized that society is more comfortable having individuals who are not
familiar with my work in the area of diversity]{.underline},
[research]{.underline}, [academics and mental health]{.underline}, [and
who also don't look like me to speak for me]{.underline}, [instead of
allowing me to publicly speak for myself]{.underline}. [And in the
end]{.underline}, society has made a conscious decision to reward these
individuals instead of me. [Let's keep it real]{.underline}, [no one
wants to hear how difficult it is for Black and Brown women to lean in
and be vulnerable in the workforce when a white woman says all is well
with the world when you know yourself]{.underline} (or whatever Brene
Brown is telling people these days). Yes, [it's easier to get people who
are uneducated on the topic of courage and vulnerability to speak up and
serve as the 'experts' instead of the actual experts]{.underline},
[because this misinformation and poor representation continues to feed
into the [Mis-Education of the Negro](https://amzn.to/3r1KMhq) narrative
Carter G]{.underline}. Woodson spoke about. [No one wants to hear from
someone who actually has the credentials and the experience to call out
the discrepancies in Brown's research in certain areas because that
would mean engaging in behaviors that would actually help Black and
Brown people. Now I said all of that to say this]{.underline}, I don't
hate Brene Brown nor do I dislike her as a professional, [but this is
the narrative many have tried to paint as they attempt to make me the
problematic Black woman]{.underline}. [I simply pointed out what I
believe to be a flaw in her subject matter as it pertains to Black and
Brown people]{.underline}, which it seems many agree with me because
they are profiting from my critique. So how have I pivoted to help make
this viral moment benefit me? I am in the process of having the Brene
Brown article copyrighted by the Library of Congress. It's my
intellectual property and at the end of the day, [I need to protect it
by any means necessary]{.underline}, [in addition to maintaining control
of how it is used and where it is used as much as I possibly can. In
closing]{.underline}, [this viral moment has reminded me that people
will read the work of a woman of color]{.underline}, [talk about it and
her behind closed doors]{.underline}, and then borrow it like a bowl of
sugar with no intentions of giving her anything back in return. Like
others who have gone before me, [I've now been labeled a problematic
Black woman]{.underline}, [while white women use my work and are
uplifted and glorified]{.underline}. [And just like]{.underline} [[bell
hooks](https://amzn.to/3qZwrC7) was passed over to shine the spotlight
on someone like Brene Brown]{.underline}, [the intellect of Black and
Brown women will continue to be used by whites]{.underline}, while we as
the experts are talked about negatively, [downplayed and pushed
aside]{.underline}. [Black and Brown women will never receive the
support we deserve nor reap significant monetary gains for our labor or
intellectual property]{.underline}, because no matter how educated we
are, how many books we've written or how well spoken we maybe, [folks
are still under the racists spell that white is right and if we have to
hear from someone Black]{.underline}, my God- let it publicly be the
voice of a Black man instead of that of an educated Black woman.

## Settler colonialism

### Perm

#### The European self-constructs Indigenous genocide and Anti-Black violence as separate phenomena. Only the aff's conception of the relationality between settler violence on indigenous homeland and chattel slavery can bring upon a more ethical understanding of conquest.

**King 19** Tiffany Lethabo King "The Black Shoals; Offshore Formations

jszion

[This kind of historical amnesia or willful North American ignorance of
Columbus's role in the slave trade and how conquest invented and
instantiated Blackness as a form of abjection in the modern world is due
to North American quotidian circulations of settler colonialist common
sense. For many, Columbus and the unfortunate yet inevitable genocide of
Indige nous peoples are traditionally treated as unrelated to Black life
and death within the public discourse of the history of the
Americas.]{.underline} Even leftist critiques of the normalized acts of
commemoration (Columbus Day) and public forms of pedagogy that
naturalize conquest typically are singularly focused on Columbus the
murderer, not Columbus the enslaver. More im portant, [what remains
uninterrogated about Columbus is his role in in augurating the modern
notion of the human and affixing it to a "European self." This European
self knows itself and continually performs its existence through the
dehumanization of Indigenous and Black people.]{.underline} This aspect
of conquest, a violent and repetitive process of making the modern human
through extinguishing Black and Indigenous life, is disavowed and will
fully forgotten. [One legacy of the Columbian rupture was the creation
of a Christian humanism that would transmute into various forms of
secular humanism]{.underline}, which, in turn, would maintain their
parasitic relationship to Indigenous and Black life. It is clear that
[various news sources disavow Columbus's role in the Atlantic Slave
trade through circulating the idea that the supposedly Black vandals
were misdirected in their public act of protest]{.underline}. The tone
and fram ing of most of the coverage presumed that Columbus and conquest
had nothing to do with Black people. [One of the problems with settler
colo nial common sense's erasure of Black suffering from the equation is
that Black critiques of the notion of the human are simultaneously
disavowed. When Black performances of resistance focus on conquest, the
making and remaking of the human as non- Indigenous and non- Black
becomes central to Black critique.]{.underline} I invoke performance
here and cite how Diana Taylor uses the term in her work The Archive and
the Repertoire. Taylor ar gues that theatrical and embodied scenarios of
conquest and discovery "haunt our present."8 [Scenarios are performed,
repeatable, and flexible "meaning- making paradigms" that make "visible
yet again, what is already there: the ghosts, the images, the
stereotypes]{.underline}."9 For example, Taylor as serts that twenty-
first century shows such as Survivor and Fantasy Island are examples of
scenarios of discovery and conquest. In fact, the "discoverer,
conqueror, 'savage,' and native princess for example might be staple
characters in many Western scenarios," as well as in these televisual
productions.

#### Any attempt to understand Settler Colonialism without fungibility and accumulation are rhetorically irresponsible, epistemically dangerous and intellectually wrong -- Only we can grapple with the ways the 'New World' became a new home for black people forging new connections between this new Native place and the people, influencing indigenous America and Canada heavily

**Holland 06** Tiya Miles and Sharon P Holland, "The African Diaspora In
Indian Country" (2006), pp. 3-4 // jszion

[Over the course of four centuries, thousands of black people, dispersed
from Africa through the traumatic vehicle of the transatlantic slave
trade, were relocated to Native lands and among Native populations in
the ''New World.']{.underline}' In the aftermath of slavery in the
United States, many others freely migrated to Indian Territory of
present-day Oklahoma to escape racial injustice and violence. [Indian
country be came, for these displaced Africans, both a literal and a
metaphorical ho]{.underline}me. The major purpose and goal of this book
is to articulate in new ways this space where black experience meets
Native experience---to live in it, so to speak. Our proposal is simple:
[that Native America has been and continues to be a critical site in the
histories and lives of dispersed African peoples]{.underline}. Indeed,
the very language of ''New World'' communities and ''New World''
cultures that has become commonplace in African diaspora studies as a
means of differentiating peoples of the diaspora from peoples who
remained in the African homeland takes as an implicit and undertheorized
given the European colonization of Native America.∫ By focusing on the
(re)production of personal and tribal histories and the production of
cultural forms in the context of African diasporic presence in
indigenous North America, Crossing Waters, Crossing Worlds provides a
means to unpack this assumption, as well as others. As African
Americanists in the main, we also wish to open a dialogue with scholars
in Native American studies[, to ask not only how Native place and
presence have affected black life, but also how black people and
cultures have influenced indigenous America, for better and for worse.
We are interested in discovering what intimate conversations and
negotiations took place between blacks and Indians in the long years
after their first encounters; what political issues, strategies, and
conflicts emerged out of their shared experience]{.underline}; and what
creative works and cultural productions were inspired by their coming
together. Overall, we seek in this book to raise and engage the central
Introduction 3 question: [What happens when key issues in African
diasporic experience, such as migration, freedom, citizenship,
belonging, peoplehood, and cultural retention and creation, and key
issues in Native American experience, such as tribalism, protection of
homelands, self-determination, political sovereignty, and
cultural-spiritual preservation and renewal, converge?]{.underline}

[The year 1441 is a palindrome.]{.underline} The date's symmetry,
doubling and mirroring, slows the eye's movement over it. [Fourteen
forty- one is also a temporal- spatial marker within Black diaspora
studies that scholars use to chart the navigational routes of the
Portuguese around the deadly reef- f illed waters and rocky shoals of
Cape Bojador to the shores of Guinea (Senegal).]{.underline}1 Gomes
Eannes de Azurara, who drafted "The Chronicle of the Discovery and
Conquest of Guinea," reported that in 1441 sailors---perhaps including
Antham Gonçalvez---brought back the first Negroes and "gold dust" to
Portugal.2 [The date slows the easy and swift movement of colonial
studies, settler colonial studies, postcolonial studies, and some
tendencies within Native studies toward 1492 and the shores of the
"Americas"]{.underline} as the accepted inaugural time- space of the
modern mode and era of conquest[. For a number of Black studies
scholars, the 1440s mark the commencement of the Portuguese slave trade,
as well as European voyages poised for the conquest of territory on the
coast of West Africa.]{.underline}3 These errant and out- of- sync time
and space coordinates of Black thought and study produce a shoaling
effect---a disruption in the movement and flow---of time and space
reflected in and narrated by Western disciplinary forma tions and their
seminal texts. Throughout [The Black Shoals, Black thought, movement,
aesthetics, resistance, and lived experience will be interpreted as a
form of chafing and rubbing up against the normative flows of Western
thought]{.underline}. Specifically, The Black Shoals will interrupt and
slow the momen tum of long- standing [and contemporary modes and
itineraries for theorizing New World violence, social relations,
Indigeneity, and Blackness in the Western Hemisphere.]{.underline}

### MH Legacy

#### Mathew Henson's legacy was honored by the United States. 

**AMC, No Date** Arlington National Cemetery**,**
https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Notable-Graves/Explorers/Matthew-Henson.
// jszion

In 1912, Henson published an account of his experiences, \"A Negro
Explorer at the North Pole,\" and he gave lectures throughout the
country. Compared to Peary, however, he received relatively little
immediate recognition for his part in the 1909 expedition to the North
Pole. He spent the remainder of his career in obscurity, working as a
clerk at the U.S. Customs House in New York City. Late in his life,
Henson received some long-overdue honors: [the prestigious Explorers
Club finally admitted him as a member in 1937, Congress awarded him the
Peary Polar Expedition Medal in 1944, and Presidents Harry S. Truman and
Dwight D. Eisenhower welcomed him to the White House.]{.underline}

After his death in 1955, Matthew Henson was buried at New York\'s
Woodlawn Cemetery[. In 1987, at the request of Dr. S. Allen Counter of
Harvard University---a neurobiologist, explorer and expert on
Henson---President Ronald Reagan granted an exception to Arlington
National Cemetery\'s]{.underline} burial policy, allowing for the bodies
of Henson and his wife, Lucy Ross Henson, to be reinterred at Arlington
[with full military honors.]{.underline}

[On April 6, 1988, the remains of Matthew Henson and his wife were
transported to Washington, D.C., where they were buried near the
gravesite of Admiral Peary and his wife, Josephine Deibitsch
Peary.]{.underline} Members of Henson\'s family attended the ceremony,
along with admirers from around the world. [That same year, the National
Geographic Society posthumously awarded Henson the Hubbard Medal, its
highest honor]{.underline}. The reinterment and the medal represented
the ultimate national recognition that Henson had so long deserved.

#### Matthew Henson was proud of his position with Peary, feeling like an equal.

//sul

[Matthew Henson was aware that his contribution alongside Peary was a
major accomplishment to all people of his race]{.underline}. [His words
demonstrate that he understood he would now have a place in history,
alongside the great triumphs of other people of color: Another world's
accomplishment was done and finished, and as in the past, from the
beginning of history, wherever the world's work was done by a white man,
he had been accompanied by a colored man.]{.underline} [From the
building of the pyramids and the journey to the Cross, to the discovery
of the new world and the discovery of the North Pole, the Negro had been
the faithful and constant companion of the Caucasian, and I felt all
that it was possible for me to feel, that it was I, a lowly member of my
race, who had been chosen by fate to represent it, at this, almost the
last of the world's great work.]{.underline} As Henson's words reach the
end of his book and his journey back home concluded, his final thoughts
are of a bittersweet longing. There is pride in what he had done mixed
with a yearning to be back in the Arctic lands, where friendships were
made and historic feats completed: To-day there is a more general
knowledge of Commander Peary, his work and his success, [and a vague
understanding of the fact that Commander Peary's sole companion from the
realm of civilization, when he stood at the North Pole, was Matthew A.
Henson, a Colored Man]{.underline}... And now my story is ended; it is a
tale that is told.I long to see them all again! the brave, cheery
companions of the trail of the North....the lure of the Arctic is
tugging at my heart, to me the trail is calling!

**[Another issue affecting Afrofuturism is the US-centricity of the

of American popular culture.]{.underline} However, by name [Afrofuturism
implies that it is diasporic.]{.underline} Given that [**it is difficult
for Afrofuturism to be representative of the many different communities
that claim a connection with Africa,** **the ubiquity of Black American
Afrofuturism carries the risk that the genre is reduced to futurity as
imagined by Black artists in the West.**]{.underline} It is unsurprising
that Black American Afrofuturism, as varied as it is, [t**ends to be the
material that has been most successfully popularised and absorbed into
the cultural and commercial mainstream**]{.underline}**.** [It is part
of US popular culture, which is increasingly dominant and accessible
worldwide.2]{.underline}3 I discuss this further in the final chapter on
author Nnedi Okorafor, who, frustrated with the US-centricity of
Afrofuturism, has recently started to describe some of her novels as
"Africanfuturism." She describes it as work that is "specifically and
more directly rooted in African culture, history, mythology and
point-of-view as it then branches into the Black Diaspora" (2019b). 24
The creation of Africanfuturism has not prevented Okorafor's work from
being described by others as Afrofuturist, but her decision to create a
new term supports the idea that Afrofuturism is not as diasporic and
diverse as it implies. Though I am critical of the US-centricity of
Afrofuturism, it is nonetheless reflected in this thesis, as each
chapter focuses on an American text or creator apart from the final
chapter on Okorafor who is Nigerian-American and whose books and comics
are predominantly set in various African countries.

### Turn

#### Afrofuturism gets commodified -- the affirmative accelerates corporate capture of Black imaginary and aesthetics and facilitates a kind of cultural cannibalism of Black art

[**Afrofuturism, once a cultural undercurrent largely confined to niche
communities and academic circles, has emerged as a powerful mainstream
force.**]{.underline} At its core, A[frofuturism is an aesthetic and
cultural philosophy that merges African diaspora culture with science
fiction, technology, history, and fantasy to reimagine futures shaped by
Black identity and experience.]{.underline} While it has long existed in
literature, art, and music---[**think about Sci-Fi author Octavia
Butler, musicians Sun Ra, and George Clinton---recent years have seen an
undeniable acceleration of its influence across media, fashion, and
consumer culture. It's a shift that is reshaping how brands think about
narrative, representation, and innovation.** The clearest signal yet of
Afrofuturism's mainstream arrival was the 2018 blockbuster **Black
Panther.**]{.underline} The Marvel film was **[not only a commercial and
critical success, earning over \$1.3 billion globally, but also a
cultural touchstone.]{.underline}** It placed the fictional African
nation of Wakanda, a decidedly technologically advanced and uncolonized
society, at the center of global imagination. [**For Black audiences, it
offered something rare in Hollywood: a powerful reimagining of African
excellence untainted by trauma narratives about 'the struggle'. For
brands, it opened a window into the aspirational power of future-facing
Black identity.** That cultural resonance wasn't lost on
companies]{.underline}. [Adidas, for instance, released a
[Wakanda-inspired
collection](https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/marvel-adidas-wakanda-forever-colloboration/)]{.underline}
in collaboration with athletes and designers from the African diaspora.
[Lexus, the film's automotive partner, built a]{.underline} [[custom LC

[inspired by the film's design ethos,]{.underline} integrating
Afrofuturist motifs and tech-forward aesthetics to align with the
movie's visionary style. [**These smart (and fun) brand tie-ins weren't
just superficial; they were strategic acknowledgments that Afrofuturism
speaks to a young, engaged, and identity-conscious demographic that
values creativity and cultural authenticity.** According to a McKinsey
[report,](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/the-black-experience-at-work-in-the-us)
**Black consumers in the U.S. control over \$1.6 trillion in spending
power.**]{.underline} [**Yet they are still grossly underrepresented in
cultural narratives that showcase innovation, imagination, and
success.** Afrofuturism fills that void, and it's gaining traction
across industries.]{.underline} In fashion, designers like Kerby
Jean-Raymond of [[Pyer Moss]{.underline}](https://www.pyermoss.com/),
known for his Afrofuturist runway presentations, are leveraging both
heritage and imagination to challenge the status quo. In music, artists
like Janelle Monáe and Flying Lotus infuse their work with sonic
futurism, while simultaneously confronting present-day issues like
gender, race, and systemic inequality. [T**hese expressions are not just
art---they are consumer touchpoints.** In a 2022 YPulse
[survey,](https://www.ypulse.com/article/2022/02/16/black-history-month-report-what-gen-z-millennials-want-to-see/)
77% of **Gen Z and millennial consumers said they believe brands should
take more initiative in promoting diverse storytelling.**]{.underline}
This is particularly important among young Black audiences, who want to
see themselves reflected not just in the stories brands tell, but also
in the future those stories imagine. The implications stretch far beyond
media and entertainment. In [tech, Afrofuturism inspires alternative
narratives about who gets to be seen as a futurist. Innovative startups
like]{.underline} [[AfroTech]{.underline}](https://afrotech.com/) [are
creating spaces for Black technologists and creatives to build
innovations grounded in both culture and possibility.]{.underline} For
industries such as gaming and VR, this offers fertile ground for
inclusive world-building. G[ames such as Spider-Man: Miles Morales and
Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan are exploring African diasporic
narratives in ways that go beyond tokenism and deep into rich cultural
immersion]{.underline}. In [retail, brands like Sephora and
[Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/?cmpid=PS_Brand!bing!Brand&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=bing&cawelaid=330000200001008199&catrk=spfid-70&caagid=1241348634632159&catci=kwd-77584296569136:loc-190&capcid=77584435793613&cadevice=c&msclkid=0aa748c5478e13a081e820f21bb09943&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand&utm_term=ulta&utm_content=ULTA_Brand_General_Exact)
have expanded their Black-owned offerings, responding to rising demand
for beauty that incorporates ancestral knowledge and speculative
aesthetics.]{.underline} The intersection of beauty and Afrofuturism
offers exciting possibilities, from packaging that honors African
symbolism to campaigns centered around the transformative power of
self-expression. A recent Deloitte
[[study]{.underline}](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/multicultural-consumer-market-strategies.html)
found that 61% of Gen Z consumers expect brands to speak to them in
culturally relevant ways---and Afrofuturism, with its fusion of heritage
and innovation, delivers exactly that. Even in categories as traditional
as consumer packaged goods (CPG), Afrofuturism offers new opportunities.
Think about food brands embracing diasporic ingredients while using
futuristic branding to market them. Companies like A Dozen Cousins or
Fly By Jing, though not explicitly Afrofuturist, align with the broader
theme of reimagining legacy through innovation and flavor-forward
storytelling. The potential for collaboration between Afrofuturist
creatives and CPG brands lies in narrative---stories that honor origin
while projecting bold visions of what's next. The rise of Afrofuturism
also reflects broader global shifts in how identity is consumed and
communicated. In the age of social media, consumers, particularly
younger ones---are curating personal brands that integrate cultural
pride with aesthetic experimentation. This is evident on platforms like
TikTok, where hashtags like #Afrofuturism garner millions of views.
Brands that ignore these spaces are not just missing out on
trends---they're missing the whole moment. By now, [**we know
representation matters, but resonance matters more.** A 2023 Morning
Consult]{.underline}
[[poll]{.underline}](https://morningconsult.com/2023/01/18/inclusive-marketing-consumer-survey/)
[found that **while 69% of consumers value inclusivity in marketing,
only 38% feel that brands deliver on it meaningfully.**]{.underline}
Afrofuturism offers a remedy---not through performative nods, but
through integrated, imaginative partnerships that center culture and
innovation in equal measure.

#### Consumption of Afrofuturism is marked by "Blackophobia and Blackphilia" -- reliance on cultural aesthetics ignores unbridled capitalism and commodification of Black art 

**Rahman '23.** Rahman, Rumana, and T. M. Rafat Rahman. "Commodified
Afrofuturism in Ryan Coogler's Black Panther," 2023.

[We should recognize the Blackophobia that lies behind much
Blackophilia, and that both may be representative of the continuing
ideological and cultural power of White supremacy in the 21st century.
(Yousman 371) In this age of unbridled capitalism, the world of cinema
has often resorted to commodifying cultural and social elements
functioning within the make believe world of films.]{.underline} A
common trope in modern cinema, involving such social elements, is the
subversion1 of [social order to show the underprivileged and
marginalized communities breaking out of the shackles.]{.underline} The
subversion creates a momentary inversion of the social order that often
attracts the underprivileged community (whose ascension or upheaval is
at the centre of the film) to flock to the theatres. [The racial
representation of black people is one such commodified element in the
west as "Hollywood recognizes that blackness as a commodity can be
exploited to bring in the bucks"]{.underline} (hooks, Reel 73). Through
such narratives involving subversion, as much as they inspire such
underprivileged communities in the society, the films simultaneously
show precisely what is not real. [By pulling the marginalized people to
the centre in a make-believe reel world, in one sense, such films
silently point out that those people are far from the centre in the real
world]{.underline}. In such manner, the surface narrative of the film,
concerning the subversion, is at war with itself when the deeper and
silent narratives are brought to the forefront. [Such is the case
through its depiction of commodified Afrofuturism denoting a
technologically advanced fictional African country of Wakanda in Ryan
Coogler's Black Panther.]{.underline} The film depicts Wakanda as a
fictional African country hidden from the world with the help of
technology to keep its wealth and resources (primarily the fictional
element of Vibranium) intact and away from the grasp of others. [The
film subverts the notion of Black African communities lagging behind in
terms of technological developments through its Afrofuturistic portrayal
of Wakanda.]{.underline} Moreover, it shows [Wakanda as one of the most
powerful nations of the world in terms of resources, warfare and
knowledge]{.underline}. In reality, with statistics suggesting that 67
percent or an estimated 871 million people in Africa do not have access
to internet -- it is evident that the scenario of most African countries
is much different from Wakanda (Munga). [This echoes bell hooks' (2009)
notion of how "the "idea" of a "black film" has been appropriated as a
way to market films that are basically written and produced by white
people as though they in fact represent and offer us---"authentic"
blackness"]{.underline} (65). Thus, such films market the unreal as
authentic on-screen. The marginalized group, such as African-Americans
accept such representation of Blackness or Black Culture as they put
more value into the existence of their representation rather than how
they are represented. On this issue, hooks writes, Concurrently,
[marginalized groups, deemed Other, who have been ignored, rendered
invisible, can be seduced by the emphasis on Otherness, by its
commodification, because it offers the promise of recognition and
reconciliation. (Black 26)]{.underline}

## Pragmatism

#### Adherence to ideologies [fails]{.underline}. Political pragmatism is [key]{.underline} to taking actual steps towards improving lives.

**Filimowicz 24**

Michael Filimowicz is a [[University
Lecturer]{.underline}](https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/teaching-faculty/michael-filimowicz.html?source=user_about----------------------3ccadc5cca7b----------------------)
in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) at Simon Fraser
University and has a background in computer mediated communications,
audiovisual production, new media art and creative writing. (Filimowicz,
Michael. "Pragmatism as a Non-Ideological Practice - Michael for
President - Medium." *Medium*, Michael for President, 2 Dec. 2024,
medium.com/michael-for-president/pragmatism-as-a-non-ideological-practice-53af61fec791.)//Irene

Pragmatism, often misunderstood as a mere absence of principles or
ideology, is deeply embedded in the fabric of American thought and
action. This uniquely American philosophical tradition, first
articulated by figures like William James and John Dewey, champions an
[unrelenting commitment to "what works" rather than adherence to rigid
doctrines or abstract ideals.]{.underline} In this sense, [pragmatism is
not an ideology at all.]{.underline} [It is a method, an ethos of
experimentation grounded in the understanding that human beings, their
societies, and their circumstances are in constant flux.]{.underline} By
[keeping all ideas provisional and subject to real-world testing,
pragmatism embraces the idea that beliefs are tools to navigate
experience --- not immutable truths.]{.underline}

The [value of pragmatism in American culture lies in its flexibility and
resilience, qualities that have long been admired in the national
psyche.]{.underline} F rom the [pioneers who innovated to survive on the
frontier]{.underline}, to the [engineers of massive infrastructure
projects like the Hoover Dam]{.underline}, [Americans have historically
prized the ability to adapt and problem-solve.]{.underline} Politically,
the [United States has often oscillated between grand ideological
movements]{.underline}, yet its enduring [strength has been its capacity
to pivot toward practical solutions in times of crisis.]{.underline}
[Pragmatism]{.underline} undergirds this adaptability. It [reminds us
that no policy, no principle, and no institution should be so sacrosanct
that it cannot be improved or, if necessary, discarded.]{.underline}

[In contemporary politics, pragmatism offers a compelling alternative to
the polarizing dynamics of ideology.]{.underline} When [factions reduce
complex issues to slogans, pragmatism steps in with an invitation to
grapple with the nuances of reality.]{.underline} For example, [consider
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.]{.underline} It was [not the product
of a single ideological vision but]{.underline} a [series of
experimental policies, each tested and revised based on
outcomes.]{.underline} Some programs succeeded and endured; others
failed and were abandoned. The [process embodied pragmatism's insistence
on feedback from reality.]{.underline} By refusing to be confined by
dogma, [FDR's administration demonstrated]{.underline} that [practical
governance]{.underline} is [not about conforming to ideological purity
but about delivering results that improve lives.]{.underline}

The [ability to embrace pragmatism is especially crucial in an era
marked by rapid technological change, environmental challenges, and
global interconnectedness.]{.underline} [**Ideological**
rigidity]{.underline} often [**falters** when confronted with the
pace]{.underline} and complexity [of modern problems.]{.underline}
[Climate change, for instance, cannot be solved through one nation's
ideology alone;]{.underline} it demands adaptive, [cooperative
approaches that evolve as scientific knowledge and geopolitical
realities shift.]{.underline} A [pragmatist would argue that policies
must emerge not from what we wish were true but from a clear-eyed
assessment of what the world requires]{.underline} --- and how to meet
those needs effectively.

[Pragmatism also has a moral dimension]{.underline}, though it does not
wear its morality as a badge of certainty. It is [grounded in an ethic
of responsibility]{.underline}: the idea that public officials must
[constantly re-evaluate whether their decisions are truly serving the
common good.]{.underline} This moral undercurrent [reflects the
narrative that runs through the best of American political
leadership]{.underline}. Abraham [Lincoln's pragmatic approach to ending
slavery]{.underline} and preserving the Union [exemplifies
this]{.underline}. His evolution [from seeking containment of slavery to
advocating its abolition]{.underline} was [not the result of ideological
capitulation]{.underline} [but of a careful reading of the historical
moment.]{.underline} Lincoln's pragmatism allowed him to navigate
profoundly divisive issues with a steadfast focus on achieving the
greatest possible good.

[Critics]{.underline} sometimes [dismiss pragmatism as lacking
conviction or being too opportunistic,]{.underline} but this [criticism
misunderstands its core. Pragmatism does not reject ideals; it simply
holds them lightly]{.underline}, recognizing that ideals can be refined
through experience. Indeed, the [strength of pragmatism lies in its
humility --- its acknowledgment that human knowledge is fallible and
that every solution is provisional.]{.underline} In the face of
ideological absolutism, this humility is a strength, not a weakness. It
[invites collaboration, creativity, and innovation while resisting the
hubris that leads to stagnation or failure.]{.underline}

The [American experiment has always been one of reinvention. Pragmatism
captures this ethos by reminding us that there is no final
answer]{.underline}, no ultimate system that will solve all problems
forever. [Instead, it calls on us to remain engaged in the iterative
process of democracy itself.]{.underline} It challenges us to keep
experimenting, to stay grounded in the evidence of what works, and to
hold even our most cherished beliefs open to revision. In a world that
is often content to argue in absolutes, pragmatism offers a radical and
hopeful vision of politics --- not as an endless clash of ideologies but
as a continuous effort to make life better for everyone, one imperfect
solution at a time.

#### Political Pragmatism focuses on viewing issues practically applying logic to solve

Philosophy", 'Routlege',

"Second, within what Scheler calls the "relative truth of pragmatism" --
that is, when pragmatism limits itself to knowledge of control --
Scheler credits it with disclosing the fundamentally practical basis of
knowledge: [Pragmatism is above all correct that the primary relation of
humans -- indeed, of all organisms -- to the world is in no way
theoretical but rather a practical one, and that from there all natural
things in the world are linked and supported by practical
motives.]{.underline} (Scheler, 1980a, p. 239) Scheler and the
pragmatists thus reject any notion of "knowledge for knowledge's sake".
Natural science is practically conditioned: what it counts as knowledge
is largely determined by social values and interests, presently those of
control and domination -- what Scheler in his Ressentiment terms the
"ethos of industrialism" (Scheler, 1972, p. 137) -- contrary to
scientists' claims to value neutrality. Agreeing with pragmatism that
knowledge begins with practical matters, Scheler protests, as seen
earlier, what he (wrongly) thinks is its reduction of all knowledge to
that of practical control. [Third, pragmatism offers, in Scheler's
judgment, the first genuinely novel alternative to rationalist and
traditional empiricist epistemologies. Knowledge lies, as James
described, neither in the apprehension of ideas imagined to""exist prior
to our experience of the world (Plato; what James termed "ideae ante
res") nor in the abstracting of ideas from experience (Aristotle; ideae
post res). Rather, knowledge is a function of our dynamic, creative
interaction with the world: ideas do not merely report, mirror, or
represent the world but evolve from practical engagement of things with
things and function instrumentally to transform the world]{.underline}
(ideae cum rebus) (James, 1975b, pp. 104--106; Scheler, 1979, pp.
119--120;2 Frings, 1997, pp. 269--270). [Pragmatism thus functionalizes
knowledge: the meaning of an idea is its actual or possible practical
uses for the organism and, hence, relative to the organism's interests
and preferences.]{.underline} This pragmatist notion of
functionalization Scheler incorporated into his epistemology and ethics,
and it is central to his sociology of knowledge: knowledge, for him, is
the functionalization of drive-rooted interests (Scheler, 1980a, pp.
198, 206, 354, 360--361; 1980b, pp. 41, 50--51, 147, 169; Frings, 1997,
p. 203, 1987). In his Sociology, then, he describes cultivation
(Bil-dung) as a process whereby sociological ideal factors (e.g.,
philosophy, religion, art) functionalize themselves in relation to
sociological real factors (family, economy, politics), in contrast to
Marxist dialectical\[...\]"

[American environmentalism dawned as a popular movement on a mild spring
afternoon in 1970.]{.underline} Wednesday, April 22nd, brought blue
skies, light breezes, and temperatures in the 60s to New York City and
Washington, D.C. Much of the rest of the country enjoyed similar
conditions. On that day, the influence of nature had particular meaning;
the nation held a celebration of clean air, land, and water. Encouraged
by the retreat of winter, millions participated. The first Earth Day may
have been prompted, in part, by the recent moon landings. [When the
astronauts turned their cameras homeward, capturing the image of a
delicate blue planet, the world looked upon itself with fresh
understanding. The context of Earth Day 1970, however, was far from
celestial, reflecting the turbulence of the time. Since the mid-1960s,
the streets has become a common outlet for political and social
discontent. Yet Earth Day, forged in an era of strife and change, had
its own personality; marijuana smoke may have hung in wisps over some of
the day\'s festivities, but violence and confrontation were nowhere to
be seen.]{.underline} [In America\'s largest city, Mayor John V. Lindsey
decided to commemorate the day in high style, closing traffic for two
hours on Fifth Avenue, from 14th Street to Central Park]{.underline}.
Along its broad path, multitudes choked the streets and sidewalks. Much
of the crowd\'s interest centered on Union Square, a crossroads of
political ferment during the 1930s. [This day, \"many more than\"
100,000 onlookers saw teach-ins, lectures, and a non-stop frisbee game
at the famous intersection. An ecological Mardi Gras lasting from noon
to midnight sprang up along 14th Street from Third to Seventh
Avenues.]{.underline} While folksinger Odetta sang \"We Shall
Overcome,\" a rock band played the Beatles\' anthem, \"Power to the
People.\" In Washington, D.C., [Congress suspended business as most of
its members, regardless of ideology, felt compelled to appear before
their constituents]{.underline}. President Nixon kept a regular schedule
at the White House. Predecessor: Conservation. While Earth Day launched
the idea of environmentalism in its present sense, the realization of
the value of wilderness and an appreciation of the consequences of its
destruction dates back several centuries in America. For example, as
early as 1652, the city of Boston established a public water supply, a
step followed in the next century by several towns in Pennsylvania. By
1800, 17 municipalities had taken similar measures to protect their
citizens against unfit drinking sources. Still, anyone living in the
great cities of New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Boston just
after the American revolution could not escape the ill-effects of
expanding urbanization: the stench of sewage in near-by rivers; the
unwholesome presence of animal and human wastes underfoot; the odors of
rotting food; the jangling shouts of vendors in narrow lanes; and the
constant grinding of hooves and iron wagon wheels on unpaved streets.
Industrialism in the nineteenth century widened the impact of
environmental degradation. Literary people were the first to sense the
meaning of this trend. Herman Melville\'s epic novel Moby Dick (1851)
and Henry David Thoreau\'s Walden, or Life in the Woods (1854)
emphasized, respectively, the power and the tranquility of nature. A
second generation of writers, perhaps sobered by the final settlement of
the American West, wrote without fictional guise. John Burroughs
published 27 volumes of intimate, experiential nature essays. John Muir,
the Scottish prophet of the rugged outdoors, set down his observations
in a series of books, beginning with The Mountains of California in
1894. President Theodore Roosevelt, who undertook a western camping trip
with Muir in 1903, came to symbolize the campaign for conservation,
which gained steadily in political popularity. During and after his
Administration, the use and retention of natural resources became a
preoccupation of government. President Franklin Roosevelt\'s New Deal
enacted a number of natural resource measures. The Soil Conservation
Service, founded in 1935, applied scientific practices to reduce the
erosion of agricultural land. The depletion of animal life received
recognition in the passage of the 1937 Pittman-Robertson Act,
establishing a fund for state fish and wildlife programs from the
proceeds of federal taxes on hunting and fishing equipment. Most
ambitious of all, the Tennessee Valley Authority erected nine dams and a
string of massive generating stations. From Ecology To Environmentalism
The definition of wilderness as an immense natural storehouse, subject
to human management, changed after the Second World War. Life on the
battle front, as well as the home front, curbed the country\'s appetite
for colossal federal projects. Moreover, the almost immediate
demobilization of the armed forces in 1945 and 1946 resulted in an
unprecedented national birthrate. Cheap home loans for veterans pushed
suburban settlement far beyond the city skylines. [As the middle class
found itself living on the edges of open lands, political questions
surfaced about the preservation of the landscape just over the back
fence. The concept of ecology\--which valued esthetics and biology over
efficiency and commerce\--began to penetrate the public
mind.]{.underline} [The growth of the cities also made plain the evils
of pollution. Media stories covered radioactive fallout and its effect
on the food chain, dangerous impurities in urban water supplies, and the
deterioration of city air. The subtle metaphor of a \"web of life,\" in
which all creatures depended upon one another for their mutual
perpetuation, gained common currency. Hence, the powerful reaction to
Rachel Carson\'s 1962 classic Silent Spring, a quietly shocking tale
about the widespread pesticide poisoning of man and nature. Her book
elicited a public outcry for direct government action to protect the
wild; not for its future exploitation, but for its own innate
value.]{.underline} In the process of transforming ecology from
dispassionate science to activist creed, [Carson unwittingly launched
the modern idea of environmentalism: a political movement which demanded
the state not only preserve the Earth, but act to regulate and punish
those who polluted it. Sensing the electoral advantage from such
advocacy, Presidents Kennedy and Johnson added the environment to their
speeches and legislative programs]{.underline}. In his 1964 and 1965
messages to Congress, Lyndon Johnson spoke forcefully about safeguarding
wilderness and repairing damaged environments. Richard Nixon showed as
much eagerness as his predecessors to profit from the issue, and he
invoked it during the bitter presidential election of 1968. As
President, however, he acted with ambivalence, moving in two directions
at once. On one hand, he raised eyebrows by appointing a National
Pollution Control Council, a Commerce Department body comprised solely
of corporate executives. He also vetoed the second Clean Water Act. At
the same time, in 1969 and 1970, he approved and directed a succession
of sweeping measures which vastly expanded the federal regulatory
protections afforded the environment. An Environmental Revolution Just
four months after his January 1969 inauguration[, President Nixon
established in his cabinet the Environmental Quality Council, as well as
a complementary Citizens\' Advisory Committee on Environmental
QuaIit]{.underline}y. Opponents denounced both as ceremonial and Nixon,
ever sensitive to criticism, rose to the challenge. He had already asked
Roy L. Ash, the founder of Litton Industries, to lead an Advisory
Council on Executive Organization and submit recommendations for
structural reform. In November, the President\'s Domestic Council
instructed Ash to study whether all federal environmental activities
should be unified in one agency. During meetings in spring 1970, Ash at
first expressed a preference for a single department to oversee both
environmental and natural resource management. But by April he had
changed his mind; in a memorandum to the [President he advocated a
separate regulatory agency devoted solely to the pursuit of
anti-pollution programs.]{.underline} Forging such an institution
actually represented the final step in a quick march towards national
environmental consciousness. [Congress recognized the potency of the
issue in late 1969 by passing the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA). This statute recast the government\'s role: formerly the
conservator of wilderness, it now became the protector of earth, air,
land, and water. The law declared Congressional intent to \"create and
maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive
harmony,\" and to \"assure for all Americans safe, healthful,
productive, esthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings.\"]{.underline} Henceforth, all federal agencies planning
projects bearing on the environment were compelled to submit reports
accounting for the likely consequences\--the now famous Environmental
Impact Statements (EISs). Secondly, NEPA directed the President to
assemble in his Cabinet a Council on Environmental Quality.
Undersecretary of the Interior Russell E. Train agreed to be its first
chairman. [The Council\'s three members and staff would assist the
President by preparing an annual Environmental Quality Report to
Congress, gathering data, and advising on policy.]{.underline} Signing
the Act with fanfare on New Year\'s Day 1970, Nixon observed that he had
\"become further convinced that the 1970s absolutely must be the years
when America pays its debt to the past by reclaiming the purity of its
air, its waters, and our living environment. It is,\" he said,
\"literally now or never.\" Pressing the initiative in his State of the
Union Address three weeks later, [the President proclaimed the new
decade a period of environmental transformation.]{.underline} On
February 10, [he presented the House and Senate an unprecedented
37-point message on the environment, requesting four billion dollars for
the improvement of water treatment facilities; asking for national air
quality standards and stringent guidelines to lower motor vehicle
emissions; and launching federally-funded research to reduce automobile
pollution]{.underline}. Nixon also ordered a clean-up of federal
facilities which had fouled air and water, sought legislation to end the
dumping of wastes into the Great Lakes, proposed a tax on lead additives
in gasoline, forwarded to Congress a plan to tighten safeguards on the
seaborne transportation of oil, and approved a National Contingency Plan
for the treatment of petroleum spills. An Agency For The Environment
Having dispatched these initiatives in spring, by early July the
Administration could concentrate its full attention on the capstone of
its program. Acting on Roy Ash\'s advice, the President decided to
establish an autonomous regulatory body to oversee the enforcement of
environmental policy. In a message to the House and Senate, he declared
his intention to establish the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and left no doubts about its far-reaching powers. Nixon declared
that its mission would center on: The establishment and enforcement of
environmental protection standards consistent with national
environmental goals. [The conduct of research on the adverse effects of

#### Social Change through Political Demands is not only ethical, but effective!

Democracy: Black Voter Mobilization and its Impact on Political
Participation and Representation.\" (pg. 3-4)// jszion

[The Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a global movement for
racial justice by raising awareness about systemic racism and police
brutality against Black people.]{.underline} Regardless of criticism and
opposition, the movement keeps fighting for change and a society with
greater equity and justice for all. In response to police violence
against Black people and the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, a wave of protests and demonstrations swept across the United
States and around the world in 2020[. The Black Lives Matter movement
organized the protests, which were notable for their size, diversity,
and persistence. Demonstrations were held across the country, with
millions of people taking to the streets to demand an end to systemic
racism and police brutality.]{.underline} Protests were usually met with
a heavy police presence, and some protests saw instances of violence and
property damage. The vast majority of protests, however, were peaceful,
and many featured powerful displays of solidarity and community
building[. The protests sparked a nationwide conversation about racism
and racial inequality in the United States, triggering widespread calls
for reform and change in policing and other systems of power and
oppression.]{.underline} Among the key demands of the movement were:
[Qualified immunity for police officers, which protects them from legal
liability for actions taken in the line of duty, is being pushed away.
Police departments\' budgets are being reduce or redirected to social
services and community-based programs.]{.underline} requiring police
officers to wear body cameras and to answer for any misconduct or
excessive use of force. Finally racial disparities in healthcare,
education, and other areas of society have to be addressed. [The
protests ended up resulting in a number of policy changes at the local
and national levels, such as the prohibition of chokeholds and other
dangerous police tactics, the removal of Confederate symbols and
statues, and the introduction of police reform legislation in Congress.
As a whole, the 2020 protests were a powerful reminder of the ongoing
struggle in the United States for racial justice and equality, as well
as the combined power of people to effect change through collective
action and social movements.]{.underline}

FÀEI mothers and I were invited to the district for a meeting to begin
conversation for a diversity recruitment program. The FÀEI families and
I were in awe that [we were being called to the district office, not to
report an issue of mistreatment against one of our students, rather, it
was as if we were part of a team with the school district.]{.underline}
There was a seriousness to the [Superintendent to create a more diverse
teaching workforce in his school district.]{.underline} The mothers of
FÀEI and I noticed a sense of [urgency in the Superintendent and a
willingness to collaborate with us as a community
organization.]{.underline} I attended that first meeting in January with
both awe and hesitancy.

From the [beginning of our work with the Superintendent, he showed FÀEI
we were being included in his long-term planning.]{.underline} He handed
out a sheet with a roadmap he called the "From Their Birth to Their
Future." [In this roadmap, different organizations were listed as
"partners" with the district to help shift the school-to-prison
pipeline.]{.underline} FÀEI was included as a partner with the school
district. [Meeting on a monthly basis, a committee-like work process
began.]{.underline} The superintendent oversaw the process. [In the
meetings with the school district, there were always representatives
from the community-at-large, which was FÀEI members; there were two or
three teachers always represented including the president from the
teacher union, and representatives from three local
universities.]{.underline} We all took on different responsibilities to
launch the program.

As a group, we began talking about starting a summer intern program we
would eventually name Root Our Own. This was March of 2016 and we were
planning for the summer of 2017. Soon after that meeting, the
superintendent sent the following email:

Hello Team! This morning, Melanie, Author, Dr. Serenity, and I
communicated about the Minority Intern Program. Little Osage Public
Schools has agreed with the recommendation by our FÀEI partners to
reinstate the program this summer. And \[an educator\] has agreed to
lead the program for the summer. These are my takeaways from this
morning's discussion. . .

There were five steps that included FÀEI as program coordinator. We were
included in the following essential processes: recruitment,
interviewing, selection of high school students, to hosting the welcome
dinner for the students, their parents, and the district staff.

[During the planning of Root Our Own, our meetings felt collaborative in
nature.]{.underline} In the meetings, the [Superintendent was always
democratic in nature.]{.underline} In one of the meetings, he even joked
that Robert rules of order were not being followed, and he didn't seem
to mind. In another instance, when an educator asked him whether there
was room for a particular student as part of Root Our Own, he noted that
there was, but then retracted himself to say, ["I don't want to speak
for the group" or at another time when he said, "I want to support the
recommendation of hiring team, but it's a team process." All of these
suggestions were hinting toward the Superintendent being inclusive of
us.]{.underline}

During one of our Root our Own meetings, Miss Anne needed to address an
issue with a district staff person across the table. She respectfully
asked to speak. I noticed Miss Anne place both of her hands on the table
while she was leaning in and sharing her thoughts. After the meeting I
asked her about that instance. She noted:

I know I have a lot of power. I know what kind of instrument I am in
this community. . . when I show up the powers shows up, and it
intimidates almost everybody in the room. . . so what I was doing was
honoring the new coordinator, Sue. Letting her know that I honor her and
respect her decisions. . . So what I was doing was letting her know
right off the bat, I ain't got no beef with you. I'm here, you know,
what's happening is what I wanted to happen. What FÀEI wanted to happen.
Y'all \[the school district\] are using all your resources. We're cool.
We just wanna make sure y'all do it and do it right. And if you're
really a momma bear \[Sue\], which I believe her, she's a single momma,
four kids, her husband did her wrong. . .. So I'm just looking for
opportunities to give her my blessing. I ain't got no beef with you.
That's what I was thinking.

From the perspective of FÀEI, a "Working together" does not mean we
don't acknowledge and give credit where credit is due. [While
understanding the geopolitics of antiblackness, Miss Anne wanted FÀEI,
an organization led by BIPOC community leaders to be recognized as a
partner for their programing---as we had proposed to the school district
from the beginning of our collaboration. We know we have power and
abilities, which needs to be recognized.]{.underline}

In [the law, abolish the system of racial segregation in education,
striving to realize equal rights to education among all RACES, and
resolutely resist racism.]{.underline} In 1954, in [Brown V. the Board
of Education of Topeka]{.underline}, the Chief Justice, Earl Allen
[ruled that public school education never allows to exist the idea of
segregation but equality, because educational institutions once
segregated will not be equal. This decision was of great significance
for promoting educational equality for minorities.]{.underline} In the
next decades, [the federal government worked hard to eliminate
segregation in education through legislation and other
measures]{.underline}, although these efforts to desegregate schools met
with fierce resistance from racists. In 1964, [the federal government
passed the Civil Rights Act]{.underline}, section 4 of which stipulated
that the [Board of Education provided technical and financial support to
solve the problem of segregation in public schools.]{.underline} Section
6 and its subsidiary articles stipulated that [no person shall be
discriminated against in any federally funded educational program on the
basis of race, color, or national origin, and prohibit the provision of
federal aid to a university that discriminates on the basis of
race.]{.underline} In 1965, the Primary and Secondary Education Act was
passed, urging all district schools to desegregate. In March 1966, the
Federal Administration of Education formulated the revised opinions on
school Anti-Apartheid Program Policy. In the 70s and 80s, the focus of
the integrate is black and white students of fusion. The fusion is
through such as set, [school choice, magnet school, the school bus plan
enrollment scale, redrawing school districts within the school district
scope, mandatory or voluntary or learning transfer and strengthen the
urban and rural learning interval and other measures to
achieve]{.underline}. As these measures were rolled out in school
districts across the country, [the courts declared that more and more
urban college districts were integrated.]{.underline} Especially into
the 1980s, a number of [Supreme Court cases spelled out how to get court
consent to remove the school segregation program, providing a legal
standard for determining when local school districts could get away with
having to do so.]{.underline} Financially subsidize the disadvantaged
minority groups, so that they can receive the same education. Since the
1960s, the [federal government has assisted and expanded secondary and
higher education for disadvantaged minority students through a variety
of financial aid.]{.underline} In 1964, [the Federal government passed
the Economic Opportunity Act, stipulating that the federal government
allocated 300 million dollars a year to aid poor students.]{.underline}
In 1965, the Federal Government [enacted the Primary and Secondary
Education Act, which provided for a substantial increase in federal
allocations for spending on primary and secondary schools.]{.underline}
Up to now, the education policy of the federal government has achieved
remarkable results. [The policy of eliminating racial segregation
provided strong conditions for]{.underline} white students to get along
with and [integrate]{.underline} with black students, alleviate the
contradiction [between white and black students]{.underline} in the
American society at that time, and improved the social status of black
students. [These policies are undoubtedly of great progressive
significance]{.underline}, but their effect on alleviating the
discrimination between white people and black people is still very
limited, which can be seen from the serious anti-black racism in the
United States today.

The articles in this PCD collection provide inspiration for future
efforts [to dismantle racism in public health and medicine]{.underline},
and they also help identify gaps in the field for future progress.
First[, these articles demonstrate the need for continued efforts to
link exposures to racial discrimination with morbidity experiences among
minoritized individuals and communities]{.underline}. Studies could
include efforts that elucidate interactions between racialized contexts
in shaping health, such as specific life stages and settings for
experiences of discrimination for discrete populations. Research could
also include more sophisticated analyses of policies, such as redlining
and resultant differences in built environments and health-promoting
environments, which are associated with inequitable health outcomes.
[Regarding the former set of studies, examinations of how distinctive
combinations of institutional policies of specific places reinforce
social marginalization could help devise more robust tactics for
pursuing equity with populations whose social positions are reinforced
by particular racialization and multiple, overlapping minoritization
processes. New discoveries here are key to overcome limitations of
strategies for addressing racism through universal remediation --- which
ignore important within-population and between-population differences in
structural positioning that can vary exposures to chronic stress and the
availability of protective social and socioeconomic
capital.]{.underline} In addition, actively considering intersections of
multiple interlocking systems of privilege and oppression, such as
racism, heterosexism, and cisgenderism, in [shaping health allows health
care and public health to be in a better position to address the
compounded effects of these systems on physical and mental health
([16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R16),[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R18),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R31),[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R47)--[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R50)).]{.underline}
Each new effort here advances use of intersectional frameworks that give
increasingly more relevant service to populations whose social positions
relative to well-being are jointly determined by the many social
systems, processes, and hierarchies stratifying society. [Regarding the
latter category of studies, analyses of interdependencies in nested
policy hierarchies and networks governing racial equity and
evidence-driven recommendations for altering them are crucial to
demolish racist systems effectively and permanently. Better addressing
enmeshed local, state and territorial, and national policies linked to
racially disparate treatment and disproportionate impact could clear
grounds upon which antiracist systems could be constructed.]{.underline}
The articles in this collection also highlight the need for educational
institutions in medicine and public health to look within themselves to
identify and dismantle fundamentally racist norms, pedagogies, and
processes that perpetuate racist practices in clinical and public health
practice and research. Efforts should examine and reform admissions and
hiring practices, curricula, teaching and mentor training and hiring
practices, approaches to retain and promote minoritized individuals and
staff, and institutional partnerships and contracting practices.
[Strategies for effectively synergizing organizational change efforts of
individual institutions to eliminate systemic racism require additional
attention. Strides here are key to transforming racism initiatives
within institutions into movements capable of tackling racism in health
care and public health systems. I]{.underline}ncreased attention is also
needed to codify and actualize the imperative of meaningfully engaging
community partners in focused efforts to address inequities in housing,
food insecurity and poverty, and other "nonhealth" domains that affect
health. [We must find ways to make community-centered strategies that
incorporate multisystemic, intersectional approaches our norm and
mandate.]{.underline} Doing so may more effectively blend and leverage
community and institutional assets, evidence, and know-how to address
racism in all systems affecting health opportunity. Additional gaps in
ongoing work, not highlighted in this collection, should also be
addressed. For example, the public health sector should become more
actively engaged in efforts to dismantle policy-mediated causes of
racial health inequities. Novel strategies, including partnerships with
grassroots action efforts (ie, emanating from communities) that inform
system changes could be pursued to stimulate action to develop or
support implementation of antiracist policies. Similar strategic
partnerships with other nonhealth sectors (eg, business, justice) for
maximum effectiveness could create powerful alliances with the potential
to influence social change in and across systems linked to racial and
ethnic differences in health. [Within the public health sector itself,
work to synchronize and achieve strategic alignments of antiracist
interventions in the areas of education, research, and public health
practice will amplify and accelerate progress toward inseparable racial
and health equity goals.]{.underline} Lastly, further examination of the
role of the COVID-19 pandemic in reinforcing the very systemic racism
responsible for observed disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among some
racial and ethnic minority populations should be contemplated as
directions for future effort are considered. New longitudinal efforts
here could describe and address the long-term consequences of systemic
racism not only for the patterning of COVID-19 health disparities by
race and ethnicity but also for the persistence and patterning of
chronic disease disparities and inequities in the social determinants of
health. These efforts could cover potential additional increases in
morbidity and mortality that may occur among some racial and ethnic
populations as COVID-19 becomes endemic. But they might also cover
possible enduring functional limitations and chronic conditions that
could be associated with complications of COVID-19, such as the
development of 1) multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, 2)
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, and 3) post-COVID-19
conditions (also known as long-COVID and postacute sequelae of
SARS-CoV-2 infection). Additional variations in subsequent
disproportionate effects by race and ethnicity on well-being for
different age cohorts should also be explored. This exploration is
suggested because the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for social
development, social participation, social network density, and
psychosocial resource availability likely also vary by chronological age
and social placement during the life course within race and ethnicity.
Lastly, the disparate systemic implications of COVID-19 for the
socioeconomic positions, collective efficacy, and access of vital
conditions for health and well-being (eg, humane housing, [quality
education, meaningful work and wealth) of racially and ethnically
diverse communities should be continuously documented and
addressed]{.underline}. Doing so may ensure that the increased attention
to systemic linkages between racism, health, and well-being stimulated
by COVID-19 and social injustices occurring during the past 3 years will
be sustained and leveraged toward societal transformation[. At a health
systems level, pandemic-associated racial and ethnic inequities in
access to prevention and treatment should be further dissected and
prospectively monitored.]{.underline} First, health systems research
could continue to identify circumstances where access inequities
existing before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic may have been
exacerbated (eg, access to screenings, treatments, or procedures for
breast cancer)
([[51]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R51)).
Characterizing and addressing the differential effects of such access
inequities on population health care trajectories across time is
essential to prevent further expansion of health gaps that widened
during the pandemic. Second, equitable receipt of COVID-19 vaccines,
novel therapeutics (eg, monoclonal antibody therapies and oral antiviral
therapeutics), and expedited treatment of individuals who received a
positive test result for the virus remain essential to reduce
disparities in severe COVID-19--associated illness and deaths that
continue to affect some racial and ethnic minority populations
([[52]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R52)--[[54]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R54)).
[Accordingly, research that clarifies strong leverage points and tactics
for severing pathways through which structural racism shapes inequities
in access to such modalities among racially and ethnically diverse
populations is important to improve enjoyment of the protective benefits
of these interventions by people with higher risks for exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 and for adverse outcomes]{.underline}. Moreover, evaluations
of supply prioritization, allocation, and distribution strategies and
resource triage protocols enacted during the pandemic may provide
evidence that strengthens the case for giving precedence to racial
equity considerations when deciding how to deploy scare resources as
SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve
([[54]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R54),[[55]{.underline}](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10317032/#R55)).
Work in these 2 highlighted areas could secure health system changes
that ensure all persons have fair and just opportunities to avoid, cope
with, and recover from the effects of COVID-19, regardless of their race
or ethnicity. Ultimately, [work to dismantle racist systems present in
health will require multipronged efforts that draw on numerous strengths
from within and outside health care and public health institutions. As
this work moves forward, our fields are called to consider bold and
innovative actions that have the potential to produce lasting
change.]{.underline}

#### Only by engaging with the state can we resolve climate change

**Chudnovsky 24**

Chudnovsky, M., Fernandez, J.C. The study of climate change: the need to
"bring the state back in". npj Clim. Action 3, 39 (2024).
https://doi.org/10.1038/s44168-024-00122-4
[[https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-024-00122-4]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-024-00122-4) 

[Organizational capacities are crucial for implementing climate
policy]{.underline}. In a broad sense, state capacity as a whole can be
defined as the ability of the state to order itself, organize itself,
generate resources, and take and prevent actions. Mann argues that a key
dimension of state power is linked to its administrative capacity rather
than its political capacity. Some key organizational dimensions for
local public agencies, relate to the priority of climate issues, the
ability to translate political commitments to action, access to
decision-making and resources, including information and budgets. The
local level must have enough budget both regarding the amount and
targeting of climate action. Of course, [the capacity to obtain and use
accurate information is fundamental to being able to prevent and react
to climate as well as the capacity to reach each place in the
territory.]{.underline} Finally, f[ormal coordination bodies with the
central level as well as with other local agencies and actors are
crucial.]{.underline} The challenge is to narrow the gap between the
design of the policy and the real possibility of its [implementation
through the existing local-level organizational capacities of state
apparatuses]{.underline}, which are the formal units that must process
them. [Local climate action]{.underline}, because of its urgent,
multidisciplinary and multisectoral nature, confronts the local state
apparatus with a problem that is incomparable with the experience
acquired in interventions in other sectoral areas. This [requires
organizational and management capacities to achieve climate policy
goals.]{.underline} Of course, the organizational capacity of the public
administration alone is not enough to address climate change. It also
requires an interdisciplinary dialog. However, the organizational
capacity dimensions cannot be replaced by good institutional and
technical designs for public policy alone. Ultimately, it is governments
that have responsibility for climate action goals derived from their
NDCs. This is particularly challenging for local state level, where
several climate policies converge. State capacities at the local level
Climate action by cities, states, and regions is a central element of
global and national responses to climate change. [Research on broader
sustainability at the local level has identiﬁed the need to acquire
diversiﬁed ﬁnancial, technical, administrative, and collaborative
capacities and competencies public administrations.]{.underline} Climate
action at the local level has received more relative attention in the
urban context but is still scarce and this have some serious
implications, for instance, regarding adaptation strategies. [Adaptation
capacity is particularly challenging at local levels of government. In
that sense, currently, many countries have made progress in devolving
responsibilities related to climate adaptation and resilience-building
to subnational governments]{.underline} through the adoption of climate
change, which typically mirrors the whole process of decentralization --
such as the one that occurred with health and education during the 90s
in Latin America. Latin America faces the challenge of addressing
climate change being the one of most affected regions with low
organizational capacities at the local level of the state. There is an
important development of literature on the subnational government of
climate change from the governance perspective. [Evidence shows that
decentralization of climate action, particularly adaptation-related
remains limited because of gaps in technical knowledge and
organizational capacity, data production and dissemination of precise
and accurate information, and human and budgeting
resources.]{.underline} As stated by Solorio, [local climate action is
constrained by the administrative, technical, and ﬁnancial limitations
of local public agencies]{.underline}. In Latin America, the climate
change adaptation agenda requires subnational responses, but this level
of government has little basic organizational capacity. In general, they
are very dependent on the resources of the central level of government
and cannot manage the necessary responses. The organizational capacity
of the state apparatus depends on the existence of an adequate budget,
personnel trained in climate issues on the capacity to carry out
strategic planning of resources and objectives to be achieved that are
sensitive to the urgency of the climate problem, on the capacity to
generate adequate, sensitive, appropriate and up-to-date information on
the multiple aspects of climate change among multiple other aspects. The
lack of consideration of these organizational capacities at the local
level has a double negative implication, one by direct lack of effective
implementation of policies and two, by inhibiting their ability to
improve their capacity in the future.

### Black Political Capacity

#### Black engagement in political context is key to equity in voting and politics. 

**Cox 24.** Jonathan M. Cox. February 27, 2024. "The Power and Promise
of the Black Vote". Congression Black Caucus Foudational. // mars

[Despite these obstacles, Black Americans have continuously fought for
their right to vote and participate in the democratic process. From the
civil rights movement of the 1960s to grassroots organizing efforts in
the present day, Black communities have been at the forefront of the
struggle for political empowerment.]{.underline} This resilience and
steadfast determination in the face of adversity speak to the enduring
importance of the Black vote in shaping the course of American
democracy. **[While we are often told that Black people do not vote,
this is a stereotype based in misinformation and a lack of historical
context. Black people, in fact, are one of the most stable voting blocs
in in the U.S.---]{.underline}**despite ongoing efforts of
disenfranchisement. [**Moreover, the Black vote has proven to be
decisive in key electoral contests, tipping the balance in favor of
candidates who prioritize the concerns of Black voters:** Black voters,
particularly **Black women, were critical to President Biden's 2020
win**, and Black voters have demonstrated a crucial role in Democratic
coalition, **helping to drive progressive issues such as abortion rights
and social justice issues. These trends serve as indicators for
presidential candidates and other elected officials seeking support from
Black communities in this year's election.**]{.underline} As we approach
the 2024 election, **[it is more important than ever for Black Americans
to lean into their electoral power, which means we must remain vigilant
and informed.]{.underline}** The upcoming issue of the Journal of the
Center for Policy Analysis and Research (JCPAR), published by the
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, is one place to seek such
education. In this issue, [contributors address some of the key issues
impacting **Black communities, specifically looking at the past five
years in order to move us forward.**]{.underline} **[The authors outline
policy recommendations in a variety of areas, including Black
homeownership, technology and AI, youth gun violence prevention, and
educational equity. The implications of this moment extend far beyond
electoral politics, shaping the very trajectory of democracy and social
life in America. By harnessing the collective power of the Black vote,
we can effect meaningful change and advance a more just and equitable
society for future generations.]{.underline}**

#### Change is possible! It happened during the Biden administration and it can happen again! 

**White House 23**, White House, 2023, \" Advancing Equity and Racial
Justice Through the Federal Government,\" The White House,
[[https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/equity/]{.underline}](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/equity/)
// MargaRet!

On his first day in office, [President Biden signed Executive Order
13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government]{.underline}. The Order recognized that,
although the ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of American
democracy, our laws, public policies, and institutions too often
exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and
communities. [The President's Order emphasized the enormous human costs
of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other disparities, and
directed the Federal Government to advance an ambitious,
whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the
challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a
more perfect union]{.underline}.

In recognition that advancing equity is a generational commitment that
will require sustained federal leadership and partnership with all
communities, President Biden signed Executive Order 14091 on February
16, 2023. [The President's second Executive Order on equity directs the
Federal Government to further build equity into the everyday business of
government and continue the work to make the promise of America real for
everyone, including rural communities, communities of color, Tribal
communities, LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and
Intersex) individuals, people with disabilities, women and girls, and
communities impacted by persistent poverty.]{.underline}

[Over the last three years, the Biden-Harris Administration has
championed racial equity and further advanced equal opportunity for
underserved communities through landmark legislation including the
American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science
Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, as well as through historic executive
actions.]{.underline} 90 agencies across the Federal Government created
and released Equity Action Plans on April 14, 2022 ---
[first-of-their-kind roadmaps to address the barriers and discrimination
that underserved communities face.]{.underline} However, members of
underserved communities --- many of whom have endured generations of
discrimination and disinvestment --- still confront significant barriers
to realizing the full promise of America: persistent poverty and food
insecurity; unequal distribution of state and local school aid;
inequitable access to clean water and clean air; and exposure to
environmental toxins in rural, urban, and Tribal communities, and in
U.S. territories; pay inequities that overwhelmingly impact women,
people of color, and people with disabilities; poor health outcomes,
including disparities in maternal health; and unequal access to loans
and bias in the housing appraisal system. [The Federal Government has a
responsibility to make every effort to remove these barriers and ensure
equal opportunity for every person in America.]{.underline}

[Revisit 2022 Agency Equity Action Plans]{.underline}

In accordance with Executive Order 14091, federal agencies updated their
Equity Action Plans in 2023, to address potential barriers that
underserved communities may continue to face in accessing and
benefitting from the agency's policies, programs, and activities,
including procurement, contracting, and grant opportunities. The updated
Plans include over 100 new commitments and strategies that 23 of the
largest federal agencies will undertake in 2024 and beyond, as well as
new actions from smaller and independent agencies, to advance racial
equity and support for underserved communities under the umbrella of
eight whole-of-government equity objectives. These collective efforts
are furthering the Biden-Harris Administration's priority of building a
more equitable nation. Learn about the Biden-Harris Administration's
progress to advance racial equity and support for underserved
communities in a new report, which includes a sample of the more than
650 accomplishments since the release of the 2022 Equity Action Plans.

[The Biden-Harris Administration has a far-reaching equity agenda, which
also includes implementing the first-ever national strategy on gender
equity and equality; working to ensure the Federal Government is a model
for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce;
delivering environmental justice through the Justice40 Initiative; and
advancing LGBTQI+ civil rights]{.underline}. These commitments also
reflect attention to the reality that some individuals experience
discrimination based on multiple factors.

### Development Good

#### Development good---solves racism 

**Ojaank** 9/3/20**23** "The Interplay Between Social Justice and
Economic Prosperity"

[[https://www.ojaank.com/blog/detail/the-interplay-between-social-justice-and-economic-prosperity]{.underline}](https://www.ojaank.com/blog/detail/the-interplay-between-social-justice-and-economic-prosperity)
// haven

In today\'s complex and interconnected world, the concepts of [social
justice and economic prosperity are inseparable]{.underline} components
of a thriving society. While economic prosperity undoubtedly plays a
pivotal role in elevating the living standards of individuals, the
achievement of true social justice remains an imperative for the
holistic well-being of a community. This essay aims to explore the
symbiotic relationship between these two notions, emphasizing that
[there can be no genuine social justice without economic prosperity, yet
economic prosperity devoid of social justice holds no enduring
significance.]{.underline}

Economic [prosperity forms the bedrock upon which societies build their
institutions, infrastructure, and overall well-being. A robust economy
generates opportunities for employment, stimulates innovation, and
fosters the creation of wealth that can be channeled into social welfare
programs. Nations with strong economies often possess the resources
necessary to invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure,
thereby uplifting the quality of life for their citizens.]{.underline}
For instance[, countries with higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per
capita tend to exhibit lower poverty rates, improved healthcare systems,
and greater access to quality education.]{.underline}

Social justice, on the other hand, is a moral principle that seeks to
ensure equality, fairness, and dignity for all members of society. It
transcends mere economic considerations by addressing disparities in
opportunities, access to resources, and the treatment of marginalized
groups. Social justice aims to eradicate discrimination, prejudice, and
systemic inequalities that hinder individuals from realizing their full
potential. By promoting inclusivity and diversity, social justice paves
the way for a harmonious and prosperous society where every individual
can contribute meaningfully.

While economic prosperity can facilitate the realization of social
justice, the relationship between the two is complex and intertwined.
[Economic growth creates the fiscal space necessary to implement
policies that enhance social justice]{.underline}. Adequate [funding for
education, healthcare, and social safety nets becomes feasible when a
nation\'s economy is flourishing]{.underline}. Conversely, social
justice contributes to economic prosperity by fostering social cohesion,
reducing societal tensions, and enhancing human capital. When all
individuals have equal access to education and employment opportunities,
the workforce becomes more skilled and productive, driving economic
growth.

Economic prosperity that is divorced from considerations of social
justice can lead to an uneven distribution of wealth and power. This can
result in a growing wealth gap between the rich and the poor,
exacerbating social divisions and diminishing social mobility. History
has shown that societies marked by stark income inequality are often
plagued by social unrest and political instability. Without a commitment
to social justice, economic prosperity risks becoming concentrated in
the hands of a few, leading to a hollow and unsustainable development.

Likewise, the [pursuit of social justice in the absence of economic
prosperity can prove to be a futile endeavor.]{.underline} While
addressing inequalities is vital, it [requires financial resources to
implement effective policie]{.underline}s[. A society grappling with
economic stagnation or recession may find it challenging to allocate
funds to initiatives aimed at uplifting marginalized
communities]{.underline}. Thus, [social justice initiatives must be
complemented by economic growth strategies to ensure their
sustainability.]{.underline}

The harmonious interplay between economic prosperity and social justice
underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to development.
Policymakers must recognize that these concepts are not mutually
exclusive, but rather mutually reinforcing. Investments in education,
healthcare, and social safety nets can boost human capital, resulting in
a more skilled and innovative workforce that drives economic growth.
Simultaneously, economic prosperity enables governments to allocate
resources to programs that rectify historical injustices, providing
marginalized groups with the tools they need to participate fully in
society.

#### Development good---progress solves hate crimes 

**Anderson et al 20** ("Do economic downturns fuel racial animus?"

//char) 

Fig. 1 illustrates the state-level cross-sectional variation we exploit
in our analyses. Specifically, we shade each state based on the
residuals of the manufacturing and real estate shares controlling for
Census Division fixed effects and the control variables in Eq. (1)
(i.e., racial demographics and pre-recession hydrocarbon production).
States in darker shades had higher pre-recession manufacturing/real
estate shares than other states in the same Census Division with similar
values of the control variables. The manufacturing and real estate
shares are widely dispersed across the country, with relatively little
spatial clustering. Moreover, they have distinct geographic
distributions (only a handful of states exhibited above-average
pre-recession shares in both sectors), suggesting that the [results
discussed below are not driven by spatially clustered unobservables that
are correlated with both the manufacturing and real estate
shares.]{.underline} In Table 1, we report estimates of Eq. (1) using
state-level unemployment and the natural log of GDP as outcomes.7 The
results confirm that [the pre-recession manufacturing and real estate
shares are associated with a more pronounced deterioration of economic
conditions after the start of the recession.]{.underline} Specifically,
a one standard deviation increase in the pre-recession manufacturing
share is associated with a 0.53 percentage point increase in the
post-recession unemployment rate and a 3.9 percent reduction in
per-capita GDP. Similarly, [a one standard deviation increase in the
real estate share is associated with a 0.71 percentage point increase in
the unemployment rate and a 3.2 percent reduction in per-capita GDP.
Given that the estimated effects for the two sectors are of similar
magnitudes, it is not surprising that we cannot reject the hypothesis
that they are equal, which justifies summing to create a single
vulnerability index]{.underline}. A one standard deviation increase in
this index is associated with a 0.61 percentage point increase in the
post-recession unemployment rate and a 3.6 percent decrease in GDP. In
the remaining columns of Table 1, we report estimates of Eq. (3). Eq.
(3) includes the interaction between the sectoral shares and an
indicator for the year 2007, the last year before the start of the Great
Recession.8 The results provide [no evidence that states with
above-average manufacturing and real estate shares were experiencing
economic difficulties in 2007]{.underline}, which is consistent with the
parallel trends assumption of our estimator. Our baseline estimates
using racist internet searches as the outcome are reported in Table 2.
The results show that [prerecession manufacturing and real estate shares
are associated with substantial increases in racist internet searches
after the start of the recession. A one standard deviation increase in
the pre-recession manufacturing share is associated with a 5.5 percent
higher rate of racist internet searches.]{.underline} Similarly, a one
standard deviation increase in the real estate share is associated with
a 6.1 percent increase in racist searches, and a one standard deviation
increase in the recession vulnerability index is associated with a 5.8
percent increase in racist searches. Table 3 shows results for Poisson
regressions using the number of hate crimes against blacks as the
dependent variable.9 The results are qualitatively similar to those in
Table 2. [A one standard deviation increase in the pre-recession
manufacturing share is associated with a 55 percent (e0.44 − 1 = 0.553)
increase in hate crimes against blacks.]{.underline} One standard
deviation increases in the pre-recession real estate share and the
aggregate recession vulnerability index are associated with 51 percent
and 52 percent increases in hate crimes, respectively. These results
suggest that [the animus created by the economic downturn is not
restricted to racist online speech, but translates into tangible
behavior with potentially severe consequences for the affected
individuals.]{.underline} There is no evidence that states that were
especially dependent on manufacturing and real estate experienced
increases in hate crimes prior to the Great Recession in 2007. As an
additional robustness check, we estimated Eq. (8), which includes
interactions between our index of recession vulnerability and a full set
of year fixed effects: Yit = αi + λt + 2012 j=2005 δjindexi × 1(t = j) +
2012 j=2005 θjXi × 1(t = j) + εit. Point estimates and 95% confidence
intervals for the δj, the slope coefficients from Eq. (8), are shown in
Fig. 2. These coefficients capture how [the relationship between our
index of recession vulnerability index and racist internet searches
evolved over time.]{.underline} The omitted category is 2007, so the
other δj coefficients capture the slope of the relationship in year j
relative to the slope in 2007. Fig. 2 shows that[, before 2008,
unemployment rates, GDP and racist searches were on parallel trends in
states with high and low recession vulnerability.]{.underline} Starting
[in 2008, GDP begins to decrease, while racist searches and hate crimes
begin to increase]{.underline} in vulnerable versus less vulnerable
states. The unemployment rate does not begin to decrease until 2009,
consistent with its status as a lagging indicator of economic
performance. The unemployment effect of the recession vulnerability
index begins to decrease starting in 2010, but the GDP effect persists
over the entire period of observation. The estimated effect of the index
on racist internet searches peaks in 2010 and decreases afterwards. By
contrast, its estimated effect on hate crimes persists over the entire
period of observation. Overall, the graphs in Fig. 8 provide evidence
that [the time-series relationship between sectoral employment shares
and racial animus is similar to the relationship between employment
shares and economic indicators]{.underline} (i.e., the unemployment rate
and GDP), which suggests that our estimates are not driven by spurious
correlations caused by pre-treatment trends in unobservables. Finally,
we explore whether our results can be explained by latent racial
tensions coming to the fore after the election of President Obama in
2008. If latent tensions were correlated with the manufacturing and real
estate shares, and their effect on racist searches was amplified after
2008, the parallel trends assumption of our estimator would be violated.
We begin by exploring whether pre-recession sectoral employment shares
were related to survey measures of pre-recession racial attitudes or the
vote share for President Obama in the 2008 election. Table 4 shows that
the pre-recession manufacturing share was negatively related to
attitudes towards blacks as measured by our five proxies of
pre-recession racial tensions from the ANES. By contrast, the
pre-recession real estate share was positively correlated with these
same attitudes. Likewise, consistent with the hypothesis that [racial
animus reduced support for Obama in 2008]{.underline}
(Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014), [the vote share for Barack Obama was
negatively correlated with the manufacturing share of employment but
positively correlated with the real estate share.]{.underline}
Importantly, this pattern of results suggests that latent racial animus
coming to the fore is not a good explanation for our baseline results:
although the pre-recession real estate share is positively related to
racist searches after 2008 (Table 2), [it is negatively related to
pre-recession measures of attitudes towards blacks.]{.underline} In
Tables 5 and 6, we report the results of additional robustness tests
that control for our proxies for pre-recession racial tensions
interacted with an indicator for the post-recession period. In the first
column of either table, we show that controlling for the vote share for
Barack Obama interacted with an indicator for the post-recession period
has little effect on our estimates, which remain similar to those
reported in Tables 2 and 3. Likewise, controlling for survey measures of
racial attitudes has little additional effect on the estimated effect of
either sectoral share. Finally, including these additional controls has
a negligible effect on our estimates using the aggregate recession
vulnerability index. Overall, the estimates reported in Tables 5 and 6
increase our confidence that our estimates are not driven by a flare-up
of latent racial tensions after the 2008 elections. Our results suggest
that **[the Great Recession led to an increase in racial animus in the
United State]{.underline}**s. States that were [especially dependent on
the manufacturing and real estate sectors before the start of the
recession experienced more severe economic downturns as well as larger
increases in racist internet searches and hate crimes]{.underline}
against blacks. We find no evidence that this increase in racial animus
was driven by a flare-up of latent racial tensions in states with large
manufacturing and real estate sectors.

[Civilian-military collaboration has evolved significantly in recent
years, reflecting changing global dynamics]{.underline} and increasing
recognition of the crucial role of civilians in military operations.
[This collaboration often involves partnerships in planning, executing,
and supporting military missions, enhancing operational effectiveness
and community resilience.]{.underline} Presently, key trends include the
integration of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local
communities into military planning processes. [Collaborative efforts now
emphasize training programs that equip civilians with skills needed in
conflict zones, fostering a dynamic relationship between military forces
and civilian entities.]{.underline} Moreover, the rise in technology has
facilitated improved communication and information sharing. Social media
platforms allow civilians to engage directly with military units,
providing real-time feedback and support, thereby enhancing situational
awareness. [Recent data indicates that civilian participation in
military collaborations leads to successful outcomes in humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief operations.]{.underline} Such
collaborations highlight the need for strategic frameworks that
prioritize civilian input and ensure mutual benefits for both military
and civilian stakeholders. The involvement of civilians in military
collaborations raises several legal and ethical implications that merit
careful consideration. [Key aspects include the protection of civilians
and adherence to international humanitarian law, which defines the legal
framework governing armed conflicts and the treatment of non-combatants.
Civilians engaged in military tasks must navigate complex legal
definitions regarding combatant status.]{.underline} Their roles may
blur the line between civilian and military actions, leading to legal
uncertainties. These ambiguities can affect accountability for actions
taken during collaborations. [Ethically, the participation of civilians
raises questions regarding consent, autonomy, and the potential for
exploitation. The power dynamics in military-civilian relationships
necessitate an environment where ethical standards are upheld, ensuring
that civilian contributions do not inadvertently compromise their safety
or dignity.]{.underline} Critical factors to consider include: The need
for clear legal guidelines governing civilian roles. The [importance of
understanding international legal obligations.]{.underline} The ethical
responsibility of military forces to protect civilians involved in
operations.

### Link - Afrofuturism

#### The material conditions of extinction produced by capitalism cannot be resisted by the abstractions of Afrofuturism but rather through material forms of care.

[In all parts of a not-that-common world]{.underline}, [the practices
and interests of a wide variety of diverging ecologies drift away from
and oppose epic narratives of care]{.underline} (Blaser and de la Cadena

connections, cultivate their consistency, [and create the political
conditions for life to endure]{.underline} (Liboiron et al. 2018;

such an approach in these works, as a prolegomenon to future
work---[much in the same vein of the spirited avenues for medical

#### The underlying logic of capitalism prohibits the ability for afrofuturist work to escape the misrepresentation of media. 

**Park 15.** Jason Park. Nov 23, 2015. "Afrofuturism: A Movement of
Rebellion". Rutgers University. // mars

[The danger of **Afrofuturism however lies in the assumption that if
Black bodies are being represented in the media, then these media
platforms are inclusive and beneficial. This sentiment however can be
problematic because people of color can still be
misrepresented**.]{.underline} An example of misrepresentation is [**in
Black Panther,** a recent Marvel superhero blockbuster **considered to
be an Afrofuturist work.** Black Panther is problematic not because of
its Afrofuturist themes, however, **it is inherently dangerous because
the movie is backed by Marvel, a company owned by White males with the
goal of making revenue.**]{.underline}

#### Racism is produced by capitalism and the economics from colonialism. Immaterial action and a focus on structural racism cycles back to idealizing racism and trades off with universal class struggle. Prioritize universal class solidarity as means of challenging racism AND opposing capitalism.

**Stephens 17**

(Stephens, R. L. "Between the Black Body and Me." *Jacobin.com*, 2017,

Accessed 6 July 2025.)//Irene

Though [Coates does not go to the lengths Wilderson does to position
himself in opposition to materialist politics, the result is effectively
equivalent: a separation of race and class combined with a deep
skepticism of class-based solidarity, reforms, or even
revolution.]{.underline}

This is a turn away from the Freedom Tradition embodied by Fannie Lou
Hamer. [For her, the problem of racism wasn't cosmology or
ontology]{.underline} --- [it was an expression of politics implicated
in class antagonism.]{.underline} [Fannie Lou Hamer stood "with the
masses," both white and black. Solidarity through struggle from below,
including class struggle, formed her path to victory.]{.underline}

Coates's ontological pivot is more muddled than Wilderson's. Fleetingly
peppered throughout his work are allusions to material reality,
betraying the imposition of metaphysical abstraction that ultimately
drives his perspective. "We did not choose our fences," he writes. "They
were imposed on us by Virginia planters obsessed with enslaving as many
Americans as possible." Coates knows that Virginia planters did not
invent gravity or earthquakes. Yet this historicizing impulse does not
prevent him from essentializing racism when he confronts it head on.

In [[string of
tweets]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates/status/804400275872161792) from
December 2016, [Coates conceded that racism is not transcendental,
noting that "at its very root it was always economic."]{.underline} But
acknowledging racism's economic impact has not led him to embrace class
struggle. Even [Frank Wilderson can acknowledge that racism has an
economic impact]{.underline}, but he still believes that class struggle
and racism exist on distinct planes.

Coates holds a similar belief; that racism is wholly different in kind
from class. In the same series of tweets, he concluded that "in America,
'class' isn't the only kind of class."

Just as he mystifies racism, even while locating its impact in the
bodies of black people, here he again pivots. Coates cannot address
material politics on its own terms, preferring instead to retreat to a
contrived mystification. He replaces action with interiority.

As he [[recently
told]{.underline}](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2017/01/31/campus/journalist-ta-nehisi-coates-discusses-trump-race-in-america/) an
auditorium of eager Northwestern students, "The process should not be...
people looking out at the world and saying, 'I would like for there to
be change in the world, how do I do that?'" Instead, he implored the
crowd to engage from the "inside-out, not outside-in... because if you
are in the business of justice, and making this society more democratic,
you might get a lot of disappointment."

[Consciousness matters, of course. "Baby you just got to love 'em,"
Fannie Lou Hamer would say of the white segregationists who routinely
threatened her life]{.underline}. ["Hating just makes you sick and
weak."]{.underline} This was Hamer in a reflexive moment, but it was no
retreat. In the very next breath, she warned, "I keep a shotgun in every
corner of my bedroom and the first cracker even look like he wants to
throw some dynamite on my porch won't write his mama again."

[Fannie Lou truly was her mother's daughter. Reflection, whether through
intergenerational story or her own thoughts, enhanced her
resistance.]{.underline}

The same cannot be said of Coates. Instead of finding relief in
political action, Coates finds it in a cookout at Howard University's
homecoming, surrounded by black people. He fantasizes that he is
"disappearing into all of their bodies," as the music and dancing, the
black cultural zeitgeist of the moment, cure him of the "birthmark of
damnation."

The curse is lifted. Blackness is transfigured, becoming a space "beyond
the Dream." It's another ontological pivot, this time allowing Coates to
conclude that The Mecca's" --- his term for Howard --- cookout has a
"power more gorgeous than any voting rights bill."

It's a fantasy of retreat, as if black culture were beyond the
machinations of capitalism, as though black cultural expression existed
in the world but was not of it and were enough to take us to a new one.

*Between the World and Me* concludes with Coates considering climate
change. He sees climate change as a manifestation of a polluted white
consciousness, rather than the unfettered excess of industrial
capitalism. It is a "noose around the neck of the earth," allegedly
resulting in large part from white flight, the mid-century exodus of
negrophobic white families to the suburbs and the pollution caused by
the cars that took them there.

Coates's words here are poetic but grossly inaccurate. They mimic
Afro-Pessimism's emphasis on the white libido, relegating his rhetoric
to the realm of interior life, the souls of white folks, and stopping
well short of the political domain.

For Coates, the Civil Rights movement was not a struggle to alter a
material world; rather the "hope of the movement" was merely to "awaken
the Dreamers." Black politics is only relevant as far as it can arouse
white consciousness, which he sees as a largely futile exercise, due to
"the small chance of the Dreamers coming into consciousness."

Coates sees common interest between the black elite and the black poor,
as he marvels at "the entire diaspora," from lawyers to street hustlers,
present at Howard's homecoming. Yet he cannot conceive of
anti-capitalist class solidarity across racial identity. He has a darker
vision, of a kind that Corey Robin
has [[described]{.underline}](http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Intellectuals-Create-a/234984) as
"apocalypticism." Coates's ultimate hope is not in collective human
action, but rather the total annihilation of the world and all those
living in it--- another feature that unites him with Afro-Pessimism,
which calls explicitly for the "end of the world."

As he says of the Dreamers, "the field for their Dream, the stage where
they have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of us all."
Paradoxically, though he can see a collective fate in apocalypse, he
rejects shared struggle for liberation. "The Dreamers will have to learn
to struggle themselves," he declares.

[The problem is, the whole of capitalist enterprise, both past and
present, cannot be reduced to race as Original Sin. Left out of Coates's
mythology is the fact that colonial enterprise, in what would become the
United States, relied first on European indentured servants, most of
whom died within a handful of years after arriving on the
continent.]{.underline}

It's Coates's reading of race as sin that pushes him to imagine a
perverted form of salvation in the fantasy of apocalypse. In this racial
fatalism, reparations for slavery emerges as the anticipation of the
inevitable Judgement Day. It is therefore no surprise that Coates has
taken up racial reparations as his cross to bear --- not to change the
world, but to condemn it.

A Moral Debt

or the better part of two years, Ta-Nehisi Coates has been the most
visible and combative supporter of reparations in politics. Coates calls
reparations "the indispensable tool against white supremacy."

In 2016's "[[My President Was
Black]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/)"
and "[[Better Is
Good]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/ta-nehisi-coates-obama-transcript-ii/511133/),"
Coates refers to the "moral logic" of reparations. They are a measure
that could atone for what he called in 2014's "[[The Case for
Reparations]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/),"
the "sin of national plunder."

There he claimed that the nation owes a "moral debt" that must be
remedied by the "spiritual renewal" that reparations would facilitate.
Reparations for slavery is Coates's ontological pivot fully realized.

These days, we find Coates touring prestigious universities and making
his case for reparations in keynote addresses to packed auditoriums.

"I think every single one of these universities needs to make
reparations,"
Coates [[said]{.underline}](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/3/5/conference-encourages-slavery-reparations/) to
thunderous applause at a March 3 conference at Harvard University. The
day-long conference, "Universities and Slavery: Bound By History," began
with Harvard's president admitting that the university "was directly
complicit in slavery from the college's earliest days in the 17th
century."

Coates pushed the university to "use the language of reparation" as a
measure that would "acknowledge that something was done." Though Harvard
acknowledged its history, no race-specific remedy was forthcoming.

[Last fall, Georgetown did Harvard one better. They not only used the
language of reparations; the school also put forward a program of
financial and symbolic atonement. The
university [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/intent-on-a-reckoning-with-georgetowns-slavery-stained-past.html) to
selling slaves in 1838, "a transaction that helped save Georgetown from
financial ruin."]{.underline}

In 2015 [Georgetown [convened a
commission](http://slavery.georgetown.edu/report/) to "reflect upon our
University's history and involvement in the institution of slavery." The
commission recommended granting preferential admission for descendants
of the 272 slaves the university sold two centuries ago, in addition to
gestures like changing the names of campus buildings from those of
slavemasters to those of slaves and free people of color.]{.underline}

Georgetown's example is the closest actualization of reparations policy
that has taken place during Coates's three years of evangelizing.
Coates [[said of the
plan]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates/status/771378780988252161?lang=en),
"folks may not like the word 'reparations,' but it's what Georgetown
did. Scope is debatable. But it's reparations."

[Coates wants "special acknowledgment" from above, in the service of
spiritual renewal --- which explains his penchant for means-tested
trickle-down anti-racism. But if he had faith in "the masses," as Fannie
Lou Hamer did, he'd see that the renewal and acknowledgement he seeks
comes from below, from class solidarity in the struggle for universal
emancipation.]{.underline}

Harvard has a \$37 billion endowment. Mere months before Coates's
appearance, dining workers at the school were locked in a [[protracted
battle for a living
wage]{.underline}](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/harvard-strike-dining-workers-democrats-labor/).
Many of these workers are themselves descendants of slaves, but the
university was unmoved by their struggle. The dining workers spent the
better part of a month [[on
strike]{.underline}](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/10/18/why-are-harvard-dining-hall-workers-strike/azkvOnNlU9DHwiFv6GcZsO/story.html),
before finally [[forcing
Harvard]{.underline}](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/10/26/striking-harvard-workers-got-everything-they-wanted-says-union/OtLJHHoWcdXeiHbKi1WPIN/story.html) to
concede to their demands.

The university was quicker to take the less expensive measure of
admitting that the school was complicit in seventeenth century slavery
than it was to pay its workers fairly today.

[I'm a former staffer for UNITE HERE, a hospitality union. Last year, I
worked on a campaign in a multiethnic, multiracial university cafeteria
in Chicago. The campaign's primary demands were for wage increases and
healthcare, using the slogan "Dignity and a Doctor."]{.underline}
Negotiations with the subcontractor had stalled, and strike preparations
were under way. Pressures ran high. [Workers were afraid. However, just
as stories catalyzed resistance for Civil Rights leaders, stories
anchored the worker organizing in our campaign.]{.underline}

[Though workers' struggles with poverty wages and a lack of health
coverage were crucial, one story stood out above the
others.]{.underline} Workers continually shared [stories that their
Chinese colleagues were being abused for speaking Chinese on the shop
floor.]{.underline} [Managers would walk past, and upon hearing Chinese,
they'd smack the speaker on the back of the head commanding the worker
to "speak English!"]{.underline}

[Most of the workers were people of color, but the majority were not
Chinese.]{.underline} The [largest plurality in the workplace was made
up of African-Americans, virtually all of whom only spoke English. But
everyone could identify with the indignity of the story, the
asymmetrical relations that empowered the bosses to abuse any one of
them for any reason.]{.underline}

[Workers from a whole range of identities fought in solidarity with the
Chinese workers.]{.underline} Discrimination on the basis of language
became a central demand in the broader campaign. The [campaign attached
the specificity of the Chinese workers' situation to all the workers'
common struggle against the boss.]{.underline}

[This form of class struggle was not enough to overcome racism the world
over. But it did give a brief glimpse of solidarity across backgrounds
and experiences through acknowledging the shared indignity of class
exploitation.]{.underline}

In the end, [the workers won.]{.underline} As the campaign victories
were listed, the excitement in the room was overwhelming, a type of
energy that I'd only ever felt at a particularly intense church service
or while attending a high-stakes game in a packed stadium. [The
organizer announced that healthcare had been won. We clapped. We
celebrated as the wage increases were added up.]{.underline}

But [when the organizer revealed that the contract guaranteed the right
to speak non-English languages in the workplace, the room erupted. The
black workers were palpably just as invested as the Chinese workers, and
everyone was ecstatic.]{.underline}

Because [he fails to deeply consider what real, material resistance of
the masses might look like, the kind that guided Fannie Lou Hamer,
Coates ends up idealizing racism. He evokes metaphors of earthquakes and
physical laws to describe its magnitude.]{.underline}

But for the workers in that university cafeteria[, racism was a smack
from a boss. For millions of poor black people, racism is the corrosive
water pipes poisoning their bodies. School closures, crumbling and
unstable housing, and all the intimately practical things necessary for
everyday life are the measure of racism.]{.underline}

These [racist realities are not separable from questions of
class.]{.underline} In fact, [they are expressions of class
politics.]{.underline} The [racialized tragedies faced daily by people
of color require us to embrace class struggle, not Coates's demobilizing
metaphysical maxims about how white people "must ultimately stop
themselves."]{.underline}

[Solidarity from below, between cafeteria workers, truck drivers,
secretaries, and any number of everyday people is worth magnitudes more
than the kind of special acknowledgement from elites that Coates is
after.]{.underline} This solidarity through shared struggle, as Fannie
Lou Hamer recognized, is the foundation for social transformation.

[Where Coates would have us retreat, she called on us to march. She knew
that the only way to defeat racism was to fight it, every step of
the way.]{.underline}

#### Development capitalism is the root of American racism

**Vanderburgh 2021** (Wes Vanderburgh is a literary artist whose work
seeks to reopen lost futures and  explore  the legacies of the left )
https://platypus1917.org/2021/09/01/beyond-racial-capitalism-black-marxism-and-the-question-of-modernity///BCN

I will not spend too much time on this, as so many others have taken the
concept and run with it. To me, it seems that it both does not tell us
much that we do not already know, and yet transhistoricizes the concept
of "race" to the point of theoretical (not to mention practical)
uselessness. We may sum up the former with the following quote: ["The
historical development of world capitalism was influenced in a most
fundamental way by the particularistic forces of racism and
nationalism.]{.underline}"\[3\] Now, Robinson does dive into the details
of the middle and latter centuries of medieval Europe to reveal the
complicated ways in which region, language, religion, and even skin
color interacted to constitute political, economic, and discursive
relations of power. He uses this brief but rich historical sketch to
show later on how elements of these medieval relationships were
re-articulated in modern racisms. This is how he explains, for example,
[the instability of American racism: It amalgamates half-dead and yet
reconfigured aspects of older prejudices based on conflicting social
bases (e.g., imputed biological objectivity of phenotype combined with
the supposed subjectivity of religion, all wrapped up in a denial of the
modern concept of freedom of labor)]{.underline}. Far from theorizing
[capitalism as irredeemably racist, as do many contemporaries, he limits
himself to the much more realistic, if blander, recognition that
racialized aspects of control and ideology were floating around
Renaissance Europe and got sucked into the modern project. To me, this
hardly seems new.]{.underline}

But what is troubling is his sloppy and ultimately transhistorical usage
of the concepts of "race" and "racism." The rest of the quote used above
goes like this: "This could only be true if the social, [psychological,
and cultural origins of racism and nationalism both anticipated
capitalism in time and formed a piece with those events that contributed
directly to its organization of production and
exchange."]{.underline}\[4\] Is it just that the antecedents of modern
racism and nationalism already existed, anticipating their later
incorporation into capitalism? Not quite: "[The development of
capitalism can thus be seen as having been determined in form by the
social and ideological composition of a civilization that had assumed
its fundamental perspectives during feudalism."\[5\] Here we have the
crystallization of "race" into a phenomenon that apparently existed
right from the beginning, even before the beginning. Racism is a
particularly "European" disease, and thus no "European" product (Marxism
included) can ever conceivably rid itself of this original
sin.]{.underline} But Robinson already anticipated my doubts: ["And
though our era might seem a particularly fitting one for depositing the
origins of racism, that judgment merely reflects how resistant the idea
is to examination and how powerful and natural its specifications have
become. Our confusions, however, are not unique. As an enduring
principle of European social order, the effects of racialism were bound
to appear in the social expression of every strata of every European
society no matter the structures upon which they were
formed]{.underline}."\[6\] [Race is thus a category that transcends time
and place. Capitalism, then, is fundamentally racist at its core, by the
magic of an ill-defined and loosely applied category of
"race."]{.underline}

Robinson thus belies a fundamental ambiguity in his deployment of
"racial capitalism." On the one hand, [it signifies merely the many
indigenous European ethnocentrisms competing for dominance amid the
emergent Renaissance, eventually being subsumed into the Enlightenment.
On the other, it is an intrinsic and intentional part of the
European-ness of capitalism.]{.underline} But I will not concern myself
with this topic anymore. This discussion transitions nicely into the
area that I think has been under-appreciated in Robinson's work. For if
racism and racialized modes of being human pre-date the modern epoch,
then that means that our age does not represent a total reconfiguration
of what it means to be human and what potential exists to overcome this
meaning. In other words, if there is some kind of "essence" to being
human that the modern epoch did not break with, but simply remolded for
its own purposes, then there seems to be no way of transcending that
essence. What I am getting at is best understood in contrast with older
iterations of the Left's self-understanding. Since Robinson's vision
directly clashes with this, we must digress a little in order to grasp
the power (and challenge) of his critique.

[Marxism once understood itself as the heir to the radical bourgeois
project of freedom. In this way, it tasked itself with fulfilling the
revolutionary potential of capitalism, instead of contemporary visions
of softening or competing with it]{.underline}. This transition in
self-understanding hinges on the hypothesis that [there is something new
about the modern age, something that is not merely a hold-over from
previous epochs, that what it means to be and become human has
changed]{.underline}. Let us back up a bit. In one sense, the history of
the modern epoch is continuous with most previous moments in human
history. In other words, [class society has not ended with the modern
age. In fact, the violence of class society is on display with perhaps
greater concentration and ferocity now more than ever. But the new,
modern contradiction of this violence is that it points toward the
elimination of violence as such.]{.underline} The industrial mode of
production portends the ability to create abundant surplus value and
empower individuals to make of themselves what they will solely via the
transformative power of their labor. This is the promise of the modern,
even if it has become twisted and stagnated in its crisis in capitalism.
The Marxist hypothesis is that this transcendent potential exists and
only needs to be actualized.

What is new in human history, then, is a [fundamental restructuration of
what it means to be and become human]{.underline}. Human life, the
relationships needed to sustain it, and its potential expressions all
took on different forms in class societies that did not contain the
potential of their own overcoming. [In other words, gone is the notion
of a transhistorical human nature.]{.underline} Instead, one's epochal
context is the great framer of the "blank slate" of the human. Humanity
in the modern is characterized by its capacity to labor, to bring about
something that did not exist before, to create the ends of life instead
of following [the arbitrary dictates of religion or caste or a closed
mode of production like feudalism]{.underline}. Labor sets people free
to become instead of just being for the short duration of their lives.
Of course, humanity as such is also in crisis just as the modern is in
crisis in capitalism. Therefore this potential has not been realized.
But the [totalizing reach of the modern has remade what it means to be
human such that this potential now exists in a real sense. It may have
existed before in an abstract or theoretical or religious-transcendent
way. But for the first time, the ability to become nearly anyone one
wishes, and to agentically intervene in history on that basis, exists in

### Root cause

#### Labor inequality produces the form of oppression and all other oppression uses as a scaffolding -- only anticapitalist wealth redistribution can decrease the gap in wealth that produces racism

Reductive Wealth Redistribution Strategies for Curtailing Inequality in
the Era of Global Capitalism", 'Journal of Economics and Political
Economy',

[Poverty and inequality contribute to injustice and suffering
globally]{.underline}. They have [increase]{.underline}d
[in]{.underline} recent centuries as [capitalism and neoliberalism
became the prevailing economic and political doctrines.]{.underline}
[Increasing inequality has spurned criticism and efforts at reduction of
inequality. Inequality in capitalism can be explained using the theories
of Marx's infinite accumulation and Ricard's scarcity
principle.]{.underline} The former [describes the propensity for wealth
to be concentrated in fewer hands due to capitalists' ownership of the
modes of production.]{.underline} The latter considers the [increasing
cost of scarce resources like land and capital.]{.underline} The
[strategies for reducing inequality generally seek to achieve income
convergence or parity and lower the gap between rich and
poor.]{.underline} Piketty proposes a global tax rate, and Standing
advocates for a basic income. Both unfortunately insufficiently address
inherent structures of capitalism and may therefore have limited impact
upon inequality. [A successful strategy to curtail inequality will
consider the enduring inequality of capitalism.]{.underline}
[Paternalism provides one possible mechanism to ensure redistribution
actually results in greater wealth and economic growth for the
poor.]{.underline}

### Movements Trade Off

#### Decoloniality and anti-blackness are false theories that make resistance to capitalism less concentrated.

[Decolonial theory has become hegemonic within social
theory]{.underline}. Previous post-development debates once deemed
settled have resurfaced under the guise of decolonial thought. This
debate piece offers a global historical materialist critique of
decolonial theory. First, I look at a discussion of modes of production
and social formations; second, I offer eight questions as a
methodological inquiry for demystifying decolonial literature; finally,
[I apply these questions to excerpts from ]{.underline}[Walter Mignolo
and Catherine Walsh's On
Decoloniality (2018)](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r16)[ and
two other pieces by Mignolo]{.underline}.

[Implicit in this critique of decolonial theories is the thesis that
theory must be reintegrated back into history]{.underline}. As Issa
Shivji argues, 'you cannot develop alternatives in the abstract. [The
life struggles of the working people in our countries are a school from
which we can learn]{.underline}, theorize, [and develop the so-called
alternatives']{.underline} ([Mazwi and Shivji,
2021](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r13),
4). According to [Samir Amin
(1976](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r4),
69), 'rationality \[read: [theory\] is in fact always relative to a
particular mode of production and never transcends the framework of
social relations distinctive of that mode]{.underline}.' Both scholars,
[whose intellectual geography encompasses Dakar to Dar es
Salaam]{.underline}, [argue that rationality is embedded in a particular
history]{.underline} ([Al-Bulushi
2022](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r3),
2--3). Global historical materialism offers a mode of analysis for this
epistemic project that has long been ignored: the 'social formation'.
[Modes of production and social formations]{.underline} [In all social
formations]{.underline} (*Gesellschaftsformen*) there is one specific
mode of production which predominates over the rest, [whose relations
thus assign rank and influence to the others]{.underline}. It is a
general illumination which bathes all the other colors and modifies
their particularity. It is a particular ether which determines the
specific gravity of every being which has materialized within it.
-- Karl Marx, *Grundrisse*, \[1859\] 1973, 106--107 Samir Amin was a
prodigious Egyptian Marxist, [professor and economic
advisor]{.underline}. He worked at the Ministry of Planning in Bamako
(Mali) from 1960--63, was the director of the IDEP (International
Development of Economic Planning) in 1970, [and he was a co-founder and
director of the Third World Forum in Dakar]{.underline}. His theoretical
work was in service of national liberation movements attempting to
embark on autocentric development (or to delink from the law of
globalised
value).[^1^](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#fn1) Amin
saw his work as globalising Marx's project; interpreting the silences of
Marx's unfinished work. [Amin's first major intervention, Unequal
Development]{.underline}*: An Essay on the Social Formations of
Peripheral
Capitalism* ([1976](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r4)),
[introduced two Marxian concepts crucial to his project of globalising
historical materialism]{.underline}: [mode of production and social
formation]{.underline}. [These concepts are also central to my argument
of reintegrating theory -- and decoloniality -- back into
history]{.underline}. [According to Amin]{.underline}, the concept of
the 'mode of production' is an abstract one, implying no historical or
linear
sequence.[^2^](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#fn2) The
mode of production describes a set of relationships between the forces
(tools, technology, land) [and]{.underline} (social) relations of
production. He distinguishes five modes: (1) the primitive-communal
mode; (2) the tribute-paying mode; (3) the slave-owning mode; (4) the
simple petty-commodity mode ([in lieu of Marx's Asiatic Mode of
Production); and]{.underline} (5) the 'capitalist' mode of production.
[Central for Amin was that these modes are idealised types]{.underline},
never existing in a pure state. [He wrote]{.underline} [The societies
known to history are 'formations' that on the one hand combine modes of
production and on the other organize relations between the local society
and other societies]{.underline}, expressed in the existence of
long-distance trade relations. [Social formations are thus
concrete]{.underline}, [organized structures that are marked by a
dominant mode of production and the articulation around this of a
complex group of modes of production that are subordinate to
it]{.underline}. ([Amin
1976](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r4),
16)

[The social formation comprises two things]{.underline}: an amalgamation
of modes of production(s) [and social relations between a local society
and other societies]{.underline}. [I want to highlight two
points]{.underline}. The first is the spatial component within Amin's
theory of social relations which is not social relations in the abstract
but specific social relations that (unevenly) integrate a 'local
society' and 'other societies' through the mechanism of long-distance
trade. [The second is the articulation of a 'dominant mode of
production' and a 'complex group of modes of production that are
subordinate to it']{.underline}. This articulation of uneven
development, uneven exchange, [and dependency marks a unifying theme in
Amin's contributions]{.underline}, [and this articulation gets mystified
in decolonial thought]{.underline}. For [Amin
(1976](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r4),
18), 'analysis of a concrete formation demands that we discover how one
mode of production predominates over the others, [and how these modes of
production are interconnected]{.underline}.' In short, a social
formation is never one mode of production -- this would imply a pure
type -- but rather, [a relationship between multiple modes that are
unevenly interconnected and interdependent]{.underline}. Within
historical materialism, the social formation as a unit of analysis is
the grounds that renders theory legible. It is what [Aijaz Ahmad
(1992](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r2),
36) [articulates as 'the very conditions of intelligibility within which
the fundamental facts of our time can be theorized']{.underline}. [As we
move the analysis to decolonial literature]{.underline}, this legibility
becomes a point of critique. Decolonial scholars begin their critique
with modernity in the form of modernity/coloniality which began in the
sixteenth century ([Mignolo and Walsh
2018](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r16),
109,
111).[^3^](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#fn3) However,
in doing so, these scholars have created another abstract universal.
[According to Mignolo]{.underline}, coloniality 'is not a postmodern
conceptual introduction, in the sense of rejecting macronarrratives. On
the contrary, it claims the necessity of five hundred years'
macronarrratives of the colonial matrix of power' ([Mignolo and Walsh
2018](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r16),
107). Counterintuitively, [this school of decolonial literature has
reified a macro-narrative and needs to reassess]{.underline}: (1) [the
concrete ways coloniality unfolded historically and spatially and
incorporated different social formations]{.underline}; (2) the processes
by which societies, [communities and individuals are connected through a
worldwide civilisation]{.underline} (or a world capitalist system) at
the end of the nineteenth century; [and]{.underline} (3) how these
formations structures their lives, [life worlds and
subjectivities]{.underline} (Amin 1976, [9).]{.underline} [A decolonial
scholar may ask]{.underline}, why reify the macro-narrative by
reinserting it into a world-system? My answer is simple: accumulation
unfolds, operates and depends upon integration of separate social
formations on a world scale ([Bush, Bujra and Littlejohn
2011](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#r7),
189).[^4^](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#fn4) A
systemic analysis is required because the law of worldwide value has a
systemic logic. [National liberation movements require planning and
cooperation between social formations at a scale on and beyond the
nation state]{.underline} (Amin 1976,
195--196).[^5^](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.62191/ROAPE-2024-0035#fn5) By
reintegrating theory into history (from now on, social formations), [we
can trace and make theory legible]{.underline}.

### Historical Materialism

#### Marxist historical materialist class analysis informs Afro-American racism

**Camfield 16.** Camfield, David"Elements of a Historical-Materialist
Theory of Racism" Historical Materialism, 2020,
https://brill.com/view/journals/hima/24/1/article-p31_3.xml //BucKy

[Some Marxists have treated racism as fundamentally a matter of an
exceptional level of class exploitation inflicted on a particular
population.]{.underline} This view was present, for example, among early
Communists in the US20 and one current within the 'New Communist
Movement' in the US in the 1970s. [According to a publication of one
group within that current]{.underline}, [racism is 'the
super-exploitation of black people' and 'Race is only one aspect of
labor/capital class conflict]{.underline}.'21 As one commentator has
written, [this position 'acknowledges the specificity of Afro-American
oppression beyond general working-class exploitation, yet it defines
this specificity in economistic terms.'22]{.underline}

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms: [Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act
which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free
people.]{.underline} Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our
Brittish brethren. [We have warned them from time to time of attempts by
their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over
us.]{.underline} We have reminded them of the circumstances of our
emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice
and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common
kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt
our connections and correspondence. [They too have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity]{.underline}. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold
them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in
General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority
of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare,
[That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and
Independent States;]{.underline} that they are Absolved from all
Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally
dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power
to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and
to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right
do. [And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on
the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other
our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.]{.underline}

#### Digital media communication provides an organizing space for the new left\-\--Checks right wing take over.

The desire to [be at the cutting edge of mass communication has,
naturally, been a concern of the radical Left since its birth around two
hundred years ago]{.underline}. For the majority of this time, this has
chiefly meant print media. Inspired by the French Revolution and
reaching beyond the Reform Bill of 1832 to the great Chartist agitation,
Britain was awash with an eclectic mix of radical pamphlets and
publications. The later [growth of a socialist and labour movement
continued the tradition of using print as a focal point of agitation and
organisation into the late twentieth century, until the emergence of
digital media began to challenge the hegemony of print.]{.underline}
This [transformation in popular communication was itself a key element
in a re-making of social relations, related to the steady decline of
manufacturing industry in western capitalist societies]{.underline}
(Gray and Suri 2019, Harvey 1989, McNally 2006), the expansion of new
service and knowledge based sectors of the economy and the concomitant
weakening of the traditional labour movement and civil society
generally, as neoliberalism largely succeeded in imposing market
rationalities into every aspect of life. (Dardot & Laval 2013).

Today, the [political Left is largely online. Whereas what we might
characterise as the traditional, or class-based Left has found this
transition difficult, and experienced very limited success in making
it,]{.underline} (therottenelements 2022), a [new millennial Left has
more naturally embraced it.]{.underline} In Britain, one of the most
[successful of these digital-based platforms has been Novara Media (NM),
which, at the time of writing, has over 800,000 subscribers]{.underline}
to its YouTube channel and around 500,000 monthly visits, as well as a
presence across a range of other digital platforms (Maher 2024). [In
terms of its digital media presence, it currently outstrips all other
similar British-based left-wing platforms.]{.underline}

#### Don't lose hope \-- Zohran Mamdani's win of the Democratic Primary Election in NYC is a near-guaranteed spot as mayor of the largest city in the United States. This is a massive win for the Left and indicates similar results in smaller areas.

historic win: 16 takeaways. Retrieved from
https://jacobin.com/2025/06/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-cuomo // mwig

After decades of defeats for working people and the Left, it almost felt
like a dream to witness Zohran Mamdani make history last night.
Sometimes the good guys win. As David Hogg
[[wrote]{.underline}](https://x.com/davidhogg111/status/1937724987810480529)
last night, ["BREAKING: Not everything has to suck."]{.underline}
Absorbing the key lessons of this campaign is essential for the fights
ahead, not just in New York City but across the United States. 1)
[Zohran's victory is a *nationwide* political earthquake.]{.underline}
Huge numbers of voters are sick of the Democratic establishment, and
there's no good reason why his playbook can't be widely
[[repeated]{.underline}](https://x.com/richiejfloyd/status/1937820339016229201)
elsewhere. The party's decrepit old guard is vulnerable, its
unpopularity delivered us Trumpism, and it deserves to be displaced
everywhere. 2) [By stubbornly hammering on proposals to make the city
affordable, Zohran was able to break
[beyond](https://x.com/aaronnarraph/status/1937692762955993581) the
Left's college-educated base. He won all across the city, including in
[neighborhoods](https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1937713575876796738) like
Sunset Park and Woodhaven that swung rightwards towards Trump in
2024.]{.underline} Economic populism is our best weapon to win back
working people and to overcome Trumpism. [Blame the billionaires, not
immigrants or transgender people.]{.underline} 3) **[We should always
ignore the pundits and political hacks who try to convince us that
transformative change is impossible]{.underline}** --- or that the
[[best]{.underline}](https://x.com/ettingermentum/status/1937766778035195989)
we can do is chase after a mythical [[political
center]{.underline}](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/dems-can-abandon-the-center-because-the-center-doesnt-exist.html),
rather than winning the battle of ideas and ambitiously raising voters'
expectations. [4) Billionaires tried to buy this election and they lost
badly. It turns out that the oligarchy is not invincible.]{.underline}
5) Pundits will try to spin this as purely the result of Andrew Cuomo's
unpopularity or Zohran's charisma. That's part of the story, but only
part. In addition to the resonance of his policies and crystal-clear
message on affordability, [there's no way he could have won without the
tireless ground game of 50,000 volunteers and the New York City
[Democratic Socialists of America](https://socialists.nyc/) (DSA) and
other allied organizations. Knocking [1.5
million](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1937339211004154269) doors
is an astounding feat.]{.underline} 6) [Young people were the heart of
this campaign.]{.underline} Last night, tens of thousands of them got to
experience the ecstatic feeling of making history through collective
organizing. Feeling that even once is enough to make you an organizer
for life. This youthful social movement has the energy and ambition to
make New York social democratic
[[again]{.underline}](https://jacobin.com/2025/04/fiorello-la-guardia-nyc-mayor).
Absorbing the key lessons of this campaign is essential for the fights
ahead, not just in New York City but across the United States. 7) Social
media *is* extremely important for capturing the attention of wide
layers of voters, and Zohran's [[media
team]{.underline}](https://x.com/saywhatagain/status/1937693010646696338)
was amazing. But the secret sauce for good comms is not primarily
technical --- it's *political*: you need an authentic messenger armed
with a compelling platform. Hack Democrats [[can't
post]{.underline}](https://x.com/wideofthepost/status/1937750435588141525)
themselves back into relevance. 8) It's a very big deal --- with
nationwide and international implications --- that Cuomo's cynical
smears about antisemitism fell flat. It turns out that opposing genocide
and acknowledging the humanity of Palestinians is not necessarily an
electoral dealbreaker. AIPAC should be very worried. 9) [Despite what
his opponents claim, Zohran is not a dogmatic extremist but a radical
*pragmatist*.]{.underline} He could not have gotten this far had he not
focused on bread-and-butter economic issues, spoken in a commonsense
language, ran as a Democrat, dropped his support for [[defunding the
police]{.underline}](https://jacobin.com/2025/06/mamdani-mayoral-debate-public-safety),
and endorsed Brad Lander. Zohran refused to drop his support for
democratic socialism or his opposition to Zionist apartheid, but
performative ultraleftism was anathema to this campaign. 10) It took a
liberal-Left alliance to defeat Cuomo. A huge amount of credit is due to
Brad Lander for being a man of principle who refused to punch left. At
the same time, Zohran smartly rejected a widespread leftist tendency to
treat liberals and liberalism only as ideological competitors to be
fought. [Look at how he adopted the best parts of the "abundance
agenda," how he cross-endorsed Lander, and how he framed his criticisms
of Israel in the language of liberal equal rights.]{.underline} Leftists
can't defeat the old establishment --- let alone overcome the Right ---
on their own. And mutuality cuts both ways: we can't ally with liberals
*only* when we're in the lead. 11) Zohran's inroads within [organized
labor]{.underline} were crucial steps toward legitimizing his campaign.
The unions who took a risk and stood by working people by endorsing
Zohran include AFSCME DC 37, UAW Region 9a, Doctors Council SEIU,
CIR/SEIU, UNITE HERE Local 100, IATSE Local 161, PSC-CUNY, OPEIU Local
153, and Teamsters Local 804. [Every union that endorsed Cuomo should be
embarrassed by their narrow-mindedness. The good news is now they have a
chance to make things right by endorsing Zohran in the general election.
By stubbornly hammering on proposals to make the city affordable, Zohran
was able to break beyond the Left's college-educated base]{.underline}.
12) [The fight has really just begun]{.underline}. Establishment
Democrats, Donald Trump, and their billionaire funders are going to do
everything possible to prevent Zohran from taking office in November or,
if that fails, from implementing his agenda. Expect an unprecedented,
billionaire-funded scaremongering onslaught to convince New Yorkers that
a Zohran City Hall will bankrupt the city, unleash crime sprees, and
persecute Jews. 13) [Faced with claims that his project will lead to
urban ruin and chaos, Zohran can lean on the progressive, technocratic
competence of Lander's crew and point to thriving social democratic
cities across Europe as well as strong historical precedents of success
in the United States. Before they named an airport after him, as Waleed
Shahid notes, New York City's wildly successful socialist mayor Fiorello
La Guardia was also first denounced as an impractical
radical.]{.underline} 14) The experience of La Guardia, like Milwaukee's
"[sewer socialists]{.underline}," shows that winning office is not
enough. When you're up against such powerful opponents, you need lots of
organized grassroots power outside the state to actually implement your
agenda. [The most challenging obstacle on the road ahead is that
Zohran's electoral success has significantly outpaced the scale of
working-class and socialist organization in New York City.]{.underline}
Building widespread organization in workplaces and neighborhoods is
hard, essential, and urgently needed. So [[join
DSA]{.underline}](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/). Unionize
your workplace through the Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee
([[EWOC]{.underline}](https://workerorganizing.org/)).
[[Reform]{.underline}](https://labornotes.org/) your unions.
[[Salt]{.underline}](https://workersorganizingworkers.org/) a strategic
company. Or build a [[tenant
union]{.underline}](https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/tenant-unions-are-coming-landlords)
in your building. 15) [DSA's membership is about to surge.]{.underline}
And the organization is going to come under intense scrutiny from Fox
News, Trump, and the Democratic establishment. It's time to tighten our
ship and to make a concerted nationwide turn away from
self-marginalizing leftism. Members should study and emulate NYC-DSA's
mass politics orientation. If this campaign didn't fit all of your
ideological priors, maybe those priors are wrong. 16) There are going to
be all sorts of major setbacks in the months and years ahead. But after
yesterday, it's so much easier to see --- and so much easier to feel ---
[that a different world actually *is* possible if we fight like hell for
it. The future is unwritten. Let's write it together.]{.underline}
