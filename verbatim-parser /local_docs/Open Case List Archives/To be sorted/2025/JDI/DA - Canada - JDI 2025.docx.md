### Notes

The Canada DA makes the argument that Canada is becoming a global leader
now.

- This is bolstered by the Trump presidency and the election of Mark
  Carney. In addition to global events, Canada is particularly seen as a
  leader in the Arctic given proximity and amount of land.

- The link makes the claim that America beginning to assert themselves
  in the Arctic would prevent Canada from asserting their own
  sovereignty

- the second link is about UNCLOS being able to save American global
  leadership, you also need to win that claim that leadership is a
  zero-sum relationship

- There are two impacts 1. the first is leadership solving xyz
  existential crisis, this is what I would recommend reading in the 1NC.
  There are two more 1NR/2NC modules about solving AI and cyber but are
  not particularly strong.

> For the AFF, I think the strongest arguments are that Canada is simply
> not a global leader and will be constrained or going for the link
> turn.

#### Carney's win places Canada at prime position to take over as a global leader

**Nickel 4-29 -- Reporter at Reuters** (Rod Nickel, 4-29-2025, \"Carney
aims for global leadership role against Trump after Canada election
win\", Reuters,
https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/carney-aims-global-leadership-role-against-trump-after-canada-election-win-2025-04-29/)

[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney completed a comeback victory for
the governing Liberals in Monday\'s election, positioning himself for a
global role as a champion of multilateralism against U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s more protectionist policies.]{.underline}

[The first person to lead two G7 central banks has the experience to
earn immediate international credibility, experts say.]{.underline}
Carney\'s tough words for Trump during the campaign have been closely
watched in other parts of the world.

\"[Canada is ready to take a leadership role in building a coalition of
like-minded countries who share our values,\"]{.underline} Carney said
on April 3 in Ottawa. \"We [believe in international cooperation. We
believe in the free and open exchange of goods, services and ideas. And
if the United States no longer wants to lead, Canada
will.\"]{.underline}

Carney\'s Liberals beat the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre,
whose slogan \"Canada First\" and sometimes acerbic style evoked
comparisons with Trump that may have cost him the election. The
Conservatives for months had held a wide lead in the polls that
evaporated after Trump slapped tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex
the country. Canadians are shunning U.S. goods and trips in response.

While Carney remains prime minister, his Liberals appeared to win only a
minority of seats in the House of Commons, making the government more
fragile and dependent on smaller parties to stay in power.

Australia holds an election on May 3, and the major parties have closely
watched the polling surge towards Carney, Australian political
strategists said. As in Canada, voter concern over the global fallout
from Trump\'s policies has tilted support toward the center-left Labor
Party.

Former Canadian diplomat Colin Robertson, who knew Carney when he worked
at the Finance Ministry, said Carney is Canada\'s best-equipped prime
minister since the 1960s, given his experience leading the Bank of
England and Bank of Canada.

\"He goes in extremely well-prepared, with a superb Rolodex, and people
will take his call and look to him because their challenges are economic
right now,\" he said.

[Carney will likely start by expanding Canadian trade with Europe,
Australia and Asian democracies such as Japan, Robertson said, blunting
some of the economic damage from newly imposed U.S. tariffs on cars,
steel and aluminum.]{.underline}

\'DIFFICULT TIGHTROPE\'

[Fortifying Canada\'s economy is expected to be Carney\'s immediate
priority, including by advancing infrastructure projects to make Canada
less dependent on the United States, which buys 90% of Canada\'s oil
exports.]{.underline}

Leading the smallest G7 nation, Carney will then need to muster his
global coalition \"without waving a giant red flag in front of Donald
Trump,\" said Roland Paris, a former adviser to ex-Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau and now professor of international affairs at University of
Ottawa.

\"It will be a difficult tightrope or balancing act for him,\" Paris
said. \"He and Canada have an interest in coordinating with other
like-minded countries, but without necessarily setting up Canada as the
organizer of an opposition. Why turn Canada into that kind of target?\"

Paris said Carney\'s calm demeanor and financial experience may elicit a
more constructive response from Trump than the president directed at
Trudeau, whom he belittled as \"governor.\"

Robertson, a senior adviser at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute
think tank, expects Carney to try to work collaboratively with Trump,
possibly as early as the June G7 Leaders\' Summit in Alberta, where he
predicted Carney may arrange a trade meeting with Trump and Mexican
President Claudia Sheinbaum.

[Carney has promised to speed up military spending and reduce reliance
on the U.S. for defense procurement, and to work with the European
Union\'s proposed 800-billion-euro defense fund.]{.underline}

Carney, however, is unlikely to muster the influence of former German
Chancellor Angela Merkel or French President Emmanuel Macron, said Chris
Hernandez-Roy, deputy director of the Americas program at the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

\"The erosion of Canada\'s standing in the world will prevent him from
being a true leader of the Western world,\" he said, noting the
country\'s underfunded military and stagnating economy.

[Canada holds the presidency of the G7 this year, which adds to
Carney\'s platform, however.]{.underline}

TRUMP \'WRECKING BALL\'

Carney\'s win, while heartening for other global center-left
politicians, is unlikely to provide a template for others to replicate
because Trump\'s musings about annexing neighboring Canada made him a
unique existential threat, Robertson said.

But in Australia\'s election, analysts said voter dislike of Trump is
hurting centre-right opposition leader Peter Dutton, who until last
month had been in a close race.

Most polls now show rival Labor narrowly winning, or forming a minority
government with the support of independents.

\"Trump has been a wrecking ball through the conservative coalition here
and more broadly across the world. He has really dealt the conservative
movement a blow by the way he has gone about his policies in
Washington," said Andrew Carswell, former press secretary to
conservative Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office in
the previous Australian election.

In Hungary, too, leader Viktor Orban, who has praised Trump, faces the
strongest opposition in years as the economy falters and risks worsening
as Europe confronts Trump\'s aggressive trade policy.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose Labour Party Carney endorsed
in 2023, has sought to pursue a more conciliatory approach to Trump, but
has been unable to improve his poor favorability ratings.

"If Labour are looking to restore their standing with the public in
general, a tougher stance on Trump might help toward that. He\'s not a
popular guy: the tariffs, the trade war, all of this, his position on
Ukraine, all go down terribly with the British public," said Patrick
English, director of political analytics at pollster YouGov.

"But then on the other side \... in Canada, it\'s much more cut and
dried. If you\'re in favour of Donald Trump in Canada, you are pretty
much anti-Canadian."

The lesson Carney\'s win provides may apply more to parties on the right
than on the left, outside of the U.S., said Richard Johnston, a retired
political science professor at University of British Columbia: \"Get rid
of any hint of MAGA.\"

#### Canada asserting power against and independent of the United States is critical to building Canadian leadership

**Haley 17** - **a senior fellow at the Centre for International
Governance Innovation and a public policy fellow at the Canada
Institute, Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars** (James
Haley, 6-27-2017, Policy Options, "How Canada will punch above its
weight",
<https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/june-2017/how-canada-will-punch-above-its-weight/>)

[They were motivated by the unhappy realization that President Trump may
represent an existential threat to the international arrangements under
which Canada has conducted its foreign and defence policies for the past
70 years.]{.underline} These arrangements reflect the realities of the
postwar period, when the United States was the guarantor of global peace
and international financial stability. The US assumed this role by
default, not necessarily by choice. Trump seems prepared to cede these
responsibilities. Regardless, although the US was instrumental in
creating an "architecture" of treaties and treaty-based international
organizations to support it in this role, as Minister Freeland observed,
[Canada played an outsized role in this architecture by virtue of its
enormous contributions to the war effort. It was a time in which Canada
"punched above its weight" in the international ring.]{.underline}

The willingness of the Trudeau government to commit Canada to once again
punch above its weight class is both admirable and necessary. It [is
admirable because providing leadership in global affairs will entail
commitment]{.underline}; it would be much easier to ignore the shifts in
international arrangements and focus solely on domestic policy and US
relations or, as a friend derisively says, a policy of "making Canada
the best darn Michigan possible." [It is necessary because a country
that is not prepared to police the territorial integrity of its borders
cannot be considered sovereign]{.underline}. Moreover, Canada's economy
depends on access to global markets and is affected by shifts in global
commodity prices. [Our economic self-interest dictates that we help
shape the future of international trade, financial and monetary
arrangements.]{.underline}

This is no small feat. It will require careful management of Canada's
economic and strategic interests. There are three rounds, so to speak,
in this fight.

Round 1: Managing the US

The US has been, is and will remain our most important trade and
security partner. Successive generations of Canadians have grown up
secure in the knowledge that the US --- while at times difficult to
comprehend --- was a steady and reliable neighbour. [Trump has cast
doubt on that certainty]{.underline}. His offhand remarks about the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has been the foundation
of international security cooperation for seven decades, [his
derogatory, oafish behaviour toward leaders representing democratic
governments and his inexplicable regard for political strongmen in weak
democracies all point to an individual ignorant of history and incurious
to learn.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, the Trudeau government must deal with him. For the past
several months, [I suspect, the government has hoped to "manage" the
mercurial man in the White House.]{.underline} That strategy made sense.
[But it rested on the underlying assumption that much of Trump's bluster
was feigned: a ruse intended to appeal to his political
base]{.underline}. The government has probably come to the realization,
however, that that assumption may not be correct. If media reports are
to believed, the President really did come very close to scrapping
NAFTA, which was saved only by the last-minute intervention of the US
Secretary of Agriculture, who pointed out that American farmers who
voted for Candidate Trump would be harmed[. This points to a strategy to
safeguard Canadian interests in which we focus on members of Congress
from states that benefit the most from NAFTA and work directly with
states and cities that are committed to the climate change
fight.]{.underline}

The loss of NAFTA would have entailed significant disruption to the
Canadian economy. Similarly, Canada benefits enormously from the
protection of the joint North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
umbrella. A sensible strategy, therefore, is to avoid potential
frictions that might be used as a chip in Trump's "art of the deal"
bargaining. So if [Trump wants NATO members to meet their commitments to
spend 2 percent of GDP on defence, that is the price that Canada must
pay to remain a partner in NORAD. If Canada is not a partner, it would
be a supplicant and not truly sovereign.]{.underline}

Round 2: Strengthening NAFTA

As the episode with the Agriculture Secretary revealed, credible threats
are what a deal maker respects. Unfortunately, Canada lacks the capacity
to retaliate in a meaningful way; while US economic interests could be
targeted, any measures that get Washington's attention would also harm
Canadian interests. Mexico, on the other hand, has economic
(agricultural) and political (immigration) leverage that it could
exercise. Moreover, Canadian firms have large investments in Mexico that
form part of their global supply chains. The loss of these chains would
make Canadian firms less competitive in global markets. When Canada
works with Mexico to bring NAFTA into the 21st century --- for example,
by including digital technologies and other services that did not exist
a quarter century ago--- the effort advances their shared economic
interests, which go far beyond trade.

By promoting Mexican economic growth, free trade would also foster
development and political stability, providing obvious benefits for
Mexico and creating an even stronger partner for Canada. The US,
meanwhile, benefits because higher wages in Mexico mean less illegal
immigration into the US. If someone has pointed that out to the
President, it clearly has not registered.

Round 3: Strengthening the multilateral system

The final round is all about working with partners to strengthen the
multilateral system and the international institutions --- such as the
World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and regional development banks --- that promote shared
prosperity through global trade and international financial and economic
stability.

[These institutions changed the way in which nations view the global
economy. This postwar international architecture succeeded in
transforming the global economy from the beggar-thy-neighbour zero-sum
game of the 1930s, in which one wins at another's expense, into a
positive-sum game that allows all "players" to benefit, provided they
adhere to the rules of the game. That success is now at
risk.]{.underline}

[Whether through conscious policy or unintended effect, Trump poses a
threat to this system]{.underline}. In a sense, the IMF and its sister
institutions grow the "pie" to be divided by all, but they do so by
limiting the scope for discretionary actions by all the players,
including the biggest. Trump believes that the rules are rigged against
the US --- a curious proposition, given that it has had the biggest
voice in their development. He therefore seems to want to peel away
individual countries from multilateral commitments and negotiate with
them on a bilateral basis. As [the biggest player, capable of wielding
the biggest threats, that would be good for the US. It wouldn't
necessarily be good for others, however.]{.underline}

[These institutions amplify Canada's voice and extend its influence in
global decision-making, helping to protect sovereign
interests.]{.underline} [The Trudeau government is right to assert its
intent to play a more aggressive role in them, as was the case decades
ago.]{.underline} But [filling the vacuum left by the possible retreat
of the US will require that Canada provide the leadership needed to
mobilize others.]{.underline} This means avoiding the temptation to
shoehorn discussions of domestic policies into multilateral agendas, at
the IMF and other institutions. And it will require ideas.

The Global Affairs Minister's speech was long on ideals, short on ideas.
That may have been entirely intentional; it may have been an expression
of the principles on which the government will base its policies going
forward. [But the government will have to lay out concrete measures to
strengthen the institutions of international cooperation and sustain
multilateralism if Canada is to truly punch above its
weight.]{.underline}

#### Canadian leadership revitalizes multilaterism which solves a litany of existential crisis like trade wars, nukes, the environment, pandemics, and food wars

**Crane 18**, Member of the Advisory Committee of the Canada-U.S. Law
Institute, Board Member of the University of Toronto's Innovations
Foundation, Member of the Ontario Science and Technology Council,
graduate of the University of Toronto (David, 4-30-2018, \"Canada should
embrace Marcon's urgent message to defend West, reinvigorate
multilateralism,\" The Hill Times, https://archive.ph/QvKb5)

TORONTO---In an inspired and inspiring speech to the U.S. Congress that
directly challenged the narrow America First foreign policy of U.S.
President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron has set out the
urgent need to **[defend]{.underline}** the shared values of the West,
to reinvigorate **[multilat]{.underline}**eralism, and to strengthen our
multilateral institutions.

[It was a message]{.underline} that [Canada can and **should
embrace**]{.underline}. [The alternative is a high risk of **global
disorder**, the **breakdown** of]{.underline} the **[global
rules]{.underline}** and conventions that have played such a large role
in guiding progress over the past 70 years, [and **increased** risk of
**conflict** at a time when the major problems facing human society have
become more complex and can only be addressed through greater
coop]{.underline}eration---not confrontation.

[It is through a **functioning** and **trusted
multilat**]{.underline}eral system [that we have the best hope of
**averting trade wars**,]{.underline} **[nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}**, **[environmental disaster]{.underline}**,
**[financial crises,]{.underline}** and the spread of
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, as well as building defences for
cybersecurity, and strengthening our capacity to deal with
**[pandemics]{.underline}**, **[food disasters]{.underline}**, [and
**widespread migration**.]{.underline}

Yet [it is this global order]{.underline}, that the U.S. did so much to
help build, that [is now **under** direct **attack** by]{.underline} the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration which sees international
cooperation not as a positive-sum game where all benefit but as a
zero-sum game in which the U.S. is depicted as the inevitable loser
while others "win.\"

"**[It is a critical moment]{.underline}**," Macron warned a U.S.
Congress that gave him a succession of rousing ovations. "If we do not
act with urgency as a global community, I am convinced that the
international institutions, including the United Nations and NATO, will
no longer be able to exercise a mandate and stabilizing influence." His
list could have included the World Trade Organization, the International
Monetary Fund, and even the G20, as well as global pacts including the
Paris agreement on climate change, all of which are threatened in one
way or another by America First.

[What is at stake]{.underline}, Macron said, [is the liberal order that
has guided world economic development and averted major wars since
1945.]{.underline} "Other powers with the strongest strategy and
ambition will then fill the void we would leave empty. Other powers will
not hesitate again to advocate their own model to shape the 21st
century," Macron warned, adding---to cheers from the U.S. Congress---"I
do not share the fascination for new strong powers, the abandonment of
freedom, and the illusion of nationalism."

Instead, he urged, we must strengthen international cooperation. "We can
build the 21st century world order based on a new breed of
multilateralism, based on a more effective, accountable and
results-oriented multilateralism, a strong multilateralism," arguing
that multilateralism is the best way to defend freedom, peace and
progress.

This is probably the strongest direct challenge to the America First
foreign policy of the Trump administration delivered so far by any
foreign leader, and it was delivered where it really counts, on the
floor of the U.S. Congress. But it is only a beginning. Other countries,
including **[Canada]{.underline}**, [need to vigorously **reinforce the
message** and **rally** to a **defence** of our multilateral
**institutions** and their intellectual underpinnings.]{.underline}

Macron is far from alone in fearing the risks to an international
rules-based global order and a decline in Western values including
freedom and democracy. The World Economic Forum's 2018 edition of its
Global Risks Report, for example, warns that while the world faces [a
growing list of geopolitical risks]{.underline}, these [are]{.underline}
"[exacerbated by the continuing decline in commitment to rules-based
multilat]{.underline}eralism," adding that "the erosion of institutions
of multilateral dialogue and decision-making damages the prospects of
reaching new global agreements at a time when the need for cooperation
looks more urgent than ever,"

Or as the World Economic Forum's chairman, Klaus Schwab, has put it,
"this generation enjoys unprecedented technological, scientific and
financial resources, which we should use to chart a course towards a
more sustainable, equitable and inclusive future. And yet this is the
first generation to take the world to the brink of systems breakdown."

Yet we Canadians seem to have an out-of-touch view of our role in the
global community, one which is disconnected from the most urgent
problems facing the world, if the recent Canada's World Survey,
conducted by the Environics Institute for Survey Research is any guide.
The survey found that the majority of Canadians believe we are playing a
growing role in the world community. But absent is recognition of the
importance of the multilateral system.

"[Canadians continue to view their country as a positive and influential
voice in the world, one that can serve as a role model for other
countries]{.underline}," with "multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion
are increasingly seen by Canadians as their country's most notable
contribution to the world,\" the Environics survey reported. And close
to half of Canadians believe [Canada can **strengthen its
influence**]{.underline} in the world, the survey found. "[Areas of
greatest potential impact include dealing with global **migration** and
refugees, discouraging]{.underline} **[h]{.underline}**uman
**[r]{.underline}**ights **[abuses]{.underline}**,
[tackling]{.underline} hunger and **[famine]{.underline}** in the
developing world, [reducing]{.underline} the spread of infectious
**[diseases]{.underline}**, and showing leadership on environmental
issues."

### AT: Leadership Low

#### Canada is becoming a global leader now -- the election of Mark Carney and the Trump presidency has positioned Canada to become a critical global leader. Current US policy ensures and cements future Canadian leadership that's nickel AND

#### Canada is asserting itself as a global leader now

**Shkarlat 4-2 -- Reporter at RBC-Ukraine** (Kateryna Shkarlat,
4-2-2025, \"Era of US is over. Canada announces its readiness to become
global leader\", RBC-Ukraine,
https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/era-of-us-is-over-canada-announces-its-readiness-1743783422.html)

[The United States has dominated the global economy for decades. Canada
is ready to take on that role, states Canadian Prime Minister Mark
Carney, according to The New York Times.]{.underline}

Carney stated that he would try to build a \"coalition of like-minded
countries\" that would seek an alternative to the United States.

\"[If the United States no longer wants to lead, Canada
will]{.underline},\" he said.

Later, the Canadian Prime Minister added that the era of US dominance in
the global economy has come to an end.

\"[The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of
global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and
mutual respect and championed the free and open exchange of goods and
services, is over]{.underline}. While this is a tragedy, it is also the
new reality,\" Carney concluded.

#### AND there's audience data

**Bricker 24 -- Global CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs \[not the University
of Kansas Debate Coach\]** (Darrell Bricker 11-21-2024, \"Canada Viewed
as Most Positive Leader on World Stage\", Ipsos,
<https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/halifax-report-2024-influence>

[Canada remains the top country expected to have a positive influence on
world affairs over the next decade]{.underline}.  

[New polling of more than 22,000 people across 30 countries by Ipsos for
the Halifax International Security Forum]{.underline} was done amid
ongoing diplomatic tensions between Canada and India. Relations have
been frosty between the two countries since Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing of a Sikh
separatist leader in June 2023 on Canadian soil, which Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi has vehemently denied.

[In 2024, an average of 79% (-one percentage point versus 2023) say that
Canada will have an overall positive influence on world affairs over the
next decade]{.underline}. The proportion that predicts India will have a
positive influence fell two points to 48%. Out of 30 countries, people
in India are the least likely to say Canada will have a positive
influence (+five pts to 62%) while only 35% (+two pts) of people in
Canada say India will have a positive influence.

And the survey, conducted on Ipsos' Global Advisor online platform
between Sept. 20 and Oct. 4, 2024, finds "my country" (-one pt to 74%)
just inching ahead of Germany (-two pts to 73%) on average across 30
countries this year. Coming in fourth place is the European Union at 69%
(-three pts), with the United Nations (-three pts to 68%) and France
(-two pts at 68%) tying for fifth place.

[Based on the 20-country average\* Canada has enjoyed the most positive
ranking since 2015]{.underline}, while Iran has consistently been at the
bottom of the rankings.

The usual suspects

Iran (-two points to 25%) on average across 30 countries is once again
considered the least likely country to have a positive influence on
world affairs, with Pakistan (-two pts to 28%) and Israel (-12 pts to
28%) coming in right behind Iran this year.

Following the October 7 attack in 2023 and the ensuing Israel-Hamas
conflict the perception of Israel dramatically dropped year-over-year,
Russia's reputation took a similar dive in the immediate wake of the
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, dropping fifteen points
on average across 20 countries\* in 2022 but has since slowly seen its
positive ranking improve. In 2024, Russia (+two pts to 32%) comes in
well below Saudi Arabia (-one pt to 43%) to round out the bottom five.

In 2019, before the World Health Organization declared a global
pandemic, 46% on average across 20 countries\* thought China would have
a positive influence on world affairs. After a global pandemic was
officially declared in March 2020, the proportion who thought China
would have a positive influence dropped ten pts to 36% but has since
ticked back up slightly as the coronavirus crisis moves further into the
rearview mirror. China now now sits at 39% (+three pts).

Sliding scale

[Meanwhile, the proportion who think the U.S. will have a positive
influence on world affairs dropped slightly from 2023 to 2024 (-two pts
to 60%) under U.S. President Joe Biden's leadership.]{.underline} This
year's polling was completed on October 4, 2024, just over a month
before Donald Trump bested U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to clinch a
second, non-consecutive term as U.S. president.

[The last time current President-elect Donald Trump won the keys to the
White House in November 2016 America's reputation on the world stage
took a dive, with the proportion of people who thought the U.S. would
have a positive influence sliding 11 points in 2017 to 55%, on average
across 20 countries\*, and then hovered around the 50 percent mark
throughout Trump's first term]{.underline}. The global proportion who
thought the U.S. would have a positive influence then jumped back up in
2021 (+13 points to 63%) after now-current U.S. President Joe Biden was
elected. But after hitting 64% in 2022 there's been a gradual downward
slide as Biden wraps up his one-term presidency.

#### Empirics -- during the first Trump presidency Canada fell into the role of a global leader

**Labarre 17 - Assistant Professor, Royal Military College of Canada**
(Frederic Labarre, 11-15-2017, \"Canada\'s Accidental Global
Leadership\", Canadian International Council,
https://thecic.org/canadas-accidental-global-leadership/)

[Prime Minister Trudeau's November 15, 2017 announcement of Canada's new
contribution to a rapid reaction force, airlift capabilities and
monetary fund to recruit and train female UN peacekeepers and police is
far different the originally announced goal of 600 Canadian Armed Forces
personnel and 150 police officers more than a year ago]{.underline}. If
it is an innovation or unimaginative non-event remains to be seen.

Historian Paul Kennedy famously concluded in his Rise and Fall of Great
Powers (1988) that the ebb and flow of national power (or as the case
may be, superpower) was a function of economic health. [With this in
mind, Canada should congratulate its policy-makers for helping escape
the worst consequences of the 2008-2009 "Great Recession" by virtue of
fiscal responsibility and judicious budgeting.]{.underline} Our policy
makers, however, rarely contemplate what this success means relative to
other powers which have not fared so well -- namely, our primary trading
partner, the United States.

True, job growth in the United States is stellar, but job growth is an
indicator of national power only if it translates into tax revenue. The
latest news is that the Congress has passed a new tax bill, which the
Wall Street Journal calls the most significant tax overhaul since 1986.
[Meanwhile, the United States government has been unable to pass a
single budget since 2008, resorting instead to Continuing Resolution
Authorisations (CRAs) which are in effect permissions to raise the debt
ceiling, and to borrow more, some four months at a time. True, much of
this inability is due to partisan clashing]{.underline}. However,
despite historically-low interest percentage rates, the US government's
debt is higher than its GDP according to the Pew Research Center. T[he
combination of these factors may continue to distract it from its
(mostly self-imposed) global obligations]{.underline}. The Pentagon
already complains that a reliance on CRAs prevent it from engaging in
meaningful long-term strategic planning.

[Even if it weren't the case, there is a far more damning trend at work;
that of the death-spiral of American hegemonic authority. First, there
is the ever increasing distrust of President Trump at the national level
, but there is also the overwhelming decline of global trust in the
United States as an honest broker]{.underline}; the Pew Research
Center's website allows one to track the relative popularity of
countries around the world, based on Pew Research surveys, and the
results are unmistakable -- ever since the final years of Obama's
presidency, [trust in the United States has been
collapsing.]{.underline} In contrast, Germany has become the number 1
tourist destination, [and Canada's positive influence rating, based on
the World Economic Forum, stands at number 1 also at 81 percent
.]{.underline}

Positive influence rating is an interesting term. Influence means the
ability to effect meaningful change. Can we really say that Canada has
been doing that? Canadian policy makers have trouble identifying the
country's real worth worldwide -- leading Canadians to clutch to the
familiar. Witness Canada's 150th Anniversary birthday bash; beavers,
free healthcare and maple syrup. That's the view from here in Germany.
Canadians don't dare admit it, but we are much more than that, and other
countries are starting to notice. And they may hold us to account for
the future state of the world. [That is, as U.S. hegemony dwindles, we
and a few other countries may be prompted to use our talents and
resources to support the West's continued dominion on what we deem
positive and constructive global development and
prosperity.]{.underline} The frequency with which Prime Minister Trudeau
and Chancellor Angela Merkel are positively identified with change on
popular online media (the most influential -- if not always trustworthy)
like BuzzFeed, Vice, and Upworthy only equals negative broadcast of Mr.
Trump's and the U.S. image worldwide.

["Many are comfortable with 'having a seat at the table'...but we should
be interested at building that table."]{.underline}

For those content with the current state of affairs, they may quote
Joseph Nye who is convinced that the days of U.S. hegemony are far from
over. But it scarcely matters whether they are or not. What matters is
what people believe, and, increasingly, feel. [Other powers feel they
cannot trust the United States anymore.]{.underline} As evidence, we can
turn to the revision of the nuclear deal with Iran, NAFTA and the
intermediate ballistic missile treaty. Before Mr. Trump, we could also
point at President Bush's decision to abandon the ABM Treaty to develop
missile defence. These attitudes will contribute to United States'
isolation, so that when it needs political support from allies, friends
and neighbours, no one will come to their aid. [And without support,
there is no legitimacy for action.]{.underline}

The United States will continue to exercise attraction to those thirsty
for freedom. But even cultural appeal is starting to dwindle. Evidence
for this is measured by the diversity of new socio-cultural points of
attraction. [This attractiveness is a symptom of excellence which we as
Canadians are frequently ill-at-ease to acknowled]{.underline}ge. But I
am French Canadian, and unencumbered by such considerations, so let me
lay it out for you. Mark Carney, the director of the Bank of England is
Canadian. The new enfant-chéri of Hollywood is no longer Quentin
Tarantino, but Denis Villeneuve. Airline duty-free sky shops now feature
"Soirée Montréal" products on par with Swarowski. [The international
community more and more frequently turns to Canada when disaster
strikes]{.underline}; witness the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Or NATO's
operations over Libya, commanded by a Canadian, or reassurance
initiatives in the Baltic States, where the Canadian element leads in
Latvia. Bombardier's C series is so good it seems to represent an
existential threat to Boeing. Likewise, Bombardier's trains rival with
that of giant Siemens in Germany and Austria. These are only some
examples. But everywhere, Canadian excellence is crystalizing our soft
power into something ever harder -- and precious.

[Canada, I fear, will be called to take on global leadership roles more
often and this will cost resources and precious power. All the more
reasons to use it wisely.]{.underline} However, Canadian policy circles
are unprepared for that; we have a bureaucracy that is a picture of
stability and predictability, but somewhat unimaginative when it comes
to propelling [Canadian ideas worldwide. Many are comfortable with
"having a seat at the table", to quote Prof. Joel Sokolsky, but we
should be interested at building that table, and having an authoritative
say at what goes on in the world, rather than merely being a guest.
Failure to do so would mean dashing the expectations of those who turn
their eyes to us for solace and support, and, without having reaped any
of the benefits of leadership, we will lose our own
credibility.]{.underline}

#### specifically, the Arctic -- Canada is a critical leader in that region

**Larocque 6-18 - Managing Editor at Nunatsiaq** News (Corey Larocque,
6-18-2025, \"Canadian leaders are waking up to Arctic security
urgency\", Nunatsiaq News
https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/canadian-leaders-are-waking-up-to-arctic-security-urgency/)

[The uncertain world we live in has pushed Canada's Arctic to the top of
the political agenda. An aggressive Russia, an influence-seeking China,
and an unpredictable United States are forcing Canadian politicians to
tackle Arctic issues head on.]{.underline}

The Macdonald-Laurier Institute think tank in Ottawa cautioned this week
that Canada is "sleepwalking into Arctic irrelevance."

[In a commentary, researcher Alexander Dalziel called it "urgent" for
Canadian leaders to "think Arctic" when developing defence and foreign
policies.]{.underline}

"It is urgent because, to keep it stable and peaceful, status quo
actions no longer are enough," Dalziel wrote.

Ignoring the Arctic increases the likelihood of Canada's adversaries
attempting "destabilizing actions" there, he added.

You don't need a crystal ball to see that the Arctic will play a big
role in the 2025 federal election --- whether that's in the spring or in
October.

[Prime Minister Mark Carney ­--- on the fifth day in his new job ---
popped into Iqaluit on Tuesday to spell out the Liberal government's
plan for the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Amid the unravelling of the traditional Canada-U.S. relationship and
the need to shore up ties with historical allies the United Kingdom and
France, Carney made it a priority to signal where he stands on the
Arctic. It includes an operational support hub in Nunavut and hundreds
of millions of dollars to beef up a military presence in the
North.]{.underline}

Six weeks ago, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was in Nunavut,
promising to build a full-fledged military base in Iqaluit --- Canadian
Forces Base Iqaluit --- if his party forms the government.

That base would be operational within two years of the Conservatives
coming to power, he said. That seems like an ambitious target,
considering sealift and construction season limitations in the North, as
well as the demand for construction workers everywhere.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was in Iqaluit last weekend with his vision for
defending Canada's interests in the Arctic.

Singh cited the "dangerous times" we live in as the need to establish a
military base in Iqaluit. Even the NDP --- historically rooted in
pacifism --- promises to meet Canada's NATO commitment of spending two
per cent of its GDP defence ... by 2032.

This sudden attention on defence risks overshadowing the ongoing
challenges northerners deal with, including housing and the
affordability of food. [Not only do leaders need to "think Arctic" in
terms of defence and foreign policies, they must not forget to "think
Arctic" when it comes to domestic social and economic
policies.]{.underline}

No surprise, then, that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte,
were quick to stick to their policy guns, claiming that what counts is
not some arbitrary, hard-to-count, inconsistently applied measure of the
portion of national wealth devoted to defence spending, but capacity,
capability, and commitments to NATO's collective defence posture.
[Canada's **significant contribution** to the eFP]{.underline} not only
[reflects its role as one of the **most militarily capable** NATO member
states]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} also [its **rather important
role** in **political messaging** and **establishing credibility** of
the **operation as a whole**]{.underline}. [By example]{.underline},
[Canada's renewal of]{.underline} its [commitment to Baltic security
conveys]{.underline} the [military capability to inflict **substantial
costs**]{.underline} on an adversary, while denying it any ability to
quickly achieve its objectives.13 In turn, a key feature of the eFP
concept is the multinational character and interoperability capacity of
the battlegroups. This is [politically and militarily crucial in
**signalling allied solidarity**]{.underline} and enabling
burden-sharing.14 In this context, having made clear that it is not
about to up its ''fully costed'' spending on defence, Canada only had
capacity, capability, and commitments left to leverage. By renewing
early for four years, [Canada]{.underline} was looking to **[lead by
example]{.underline}**: a sustained commitment to the eFP. The hope is
that [others **will follow** suit]{.underline}. [Canada]{.underline} and
its member state partners in L0061tvia committing early to [renewal sets
the pace for renewal by]{.underline} Framework Nations and
[partners]{.underline} in Estonia and Lithuania. Together, these member
states are sending a clear signal to the US: an unambiguous commitment
to burden-sharing, at least insofar as the eFP is concerned. [Rather
than the US having to corral Canada]{.underline} to commit, as President
Obama did when the Americans were looking for a member state with
headquarters capacity to become the Framework Nation in Latvia, [Canada
**continues to corral** the US]{.underline}: [making sure the US
recommits]{.underline} as the eFP Framework Nation for Poland [and stays
the course on]{.underline} the European Deterrence Initiative, as a way
of staying the course on Russia. In a show of additional commitment to
the eFP, the Canadian government has signalled its intent to post
Canadian Armed Forces personnel and their families to the Canadian
Headquarters element in the Baltics to ensure a ''consistent and
continuous presence in Latvia.''15 This [degree of commitment is
**unique** amongst **eFP Framework Nations**]{.underline} and
contributing countries, [and signals]{.underline} a level of [commitment
**well beyond**]{.underline} the [rotational elements]{.underline} of
the battlegroup.16

#### They have massive international presence

Parallels to Canada's deployment to Afghanistan are compelling. That
major military commitment to the US-led coalition operations in
Afghanistan was considered at the time as a means to buttress the
credibility of Canada's relationship with the US as well as the
transatlantic multilateral alliance. This notion of valuing the alliance
helps to reinforce Canada's decision to go to war and remain at war. By
example, between 2007 and 2011, [Canada ranked **first** among NATO
allies in terms of]{.underline} the [share of]{.underline} its [military
personnel]{.underline} deployed to Afghanistan as a percentage of its
armed forces. Canadian troops suffered the third highest ratio of
casualties among the multinational coalition as a share of troops
deployed. The fundamental question then comes forward: why did Canada
carry such a considerable share of the burden? Massie and Zyla argue
that ''the size and riskiness of [Canada's military
deployments]{.underline} as part of the ISAF operation [not only
reflected Canada's value]{.underline} for the alliance [but]{.underline}
also [aimed at revamping]{.underline} the [**country's international
status** as a **leading military ally**]{.underline}.''20

[Canada]{.underline} offers a [military]{.underline} that is
[popular]{.underline}, [robust]{.underline}, [competent]{.underline},
and [well-equipped]{.underline}. As such, Canada has become the paradigm
for analysts arguing that the USfavoured metric of spending 2 percent of
GDP on defence is arbitrary, and what matters instead is contributing
effectively to coalition operations when requested to do so. This
metric, at times, tends to discount the efforts of allies who make
meaningful contributions to the alliance, while still falling short of
the 2 percent threshold. By example, what we are currently witnessing as
part of the eFP Latvia is certainly a continuation of Canada's
long-standing commitment to NATO --- once again dispatching forces to
Europe and lending its capabilities and highly sophisticated military
expertise to bolster the stability and security of a region that remains
essential to Canada's national interests.

Although a [US decision to **step back**]{.underline} from the eFP and
the Baltic states would call into question the future of the Alliance,
[Ottawa assures its European allies]{.underline} that it [will hold
firm]{.underline} to its current policy, [affirming Canada's
commitment]{.underline} to its solidarity with Ukraine, and remaining
committed to the 29-state alliance --- soon to be 30 with the joining of
North Macedonia --- [without it **becoming weakened** should the US
**scale back its involvement**]{.underline} in European security. By
providing a sustained military presence in Europe, [Canada's
leadership]{.underline} of a battlegroup in Latvia will continue to
[represent Canada as an **effective ally**]{.underline} when it comes to
providing for the protection of European security.

As in the past, Canada's commitment goes beyond a belief in NATO's
collective interests and values: ''Why invest billions to maintain a
capable, professional, wellfunded and well-equipped Canadian
military?''21 The answer is obvious, states Freeland: ''[To
rely]{.underline} solely [on the **US national security**
umbrella]{.underline} would [make us a **client
state**]{.underline}\.... \[S\]uch a dependence would not be in Canada's
interest\.... It is by pulling our weight\... in all our international
partnerships, that we, in fact, have weight.'' In that regard, given
current fiscal constraints, the eFP is a manageable international
commitment to the NATO alliance. Additionally, it is a commitment that
advantages the Canada--US relationship by demonstrating a willingness to
''share the burden'' without significantly increasing defence spending,
which has a forecast expenditure set at \$25.5 billion (Canadian) for
the 2018/2019 fiscal year.

Canada's approach is in keeping with its 2017 defence white paper,
Strong, Secure, Engaged, and, thus, is principled. [Given]{.underline}
the [**uncertainty** and **complexity** of the global security
environment and]{.underline} its [intricate implications for Canadian
security]{.underline}, ''[Canada will pursue **leadership roles**
and]{.underline} will [prioritise interoperability in]{.underline} its
[planning and capability development to ensure **seamless cooperation**
with allies and partner]{.underline}.''22 The political benefit of this
approach to engaging in eFP Latvia demonstrates Ottawa's willingness to
deploy its military assets in support of common defence objectives,
notwithstanding Canada's current defence expenditures of 1.23 percent
falling well below the aspiration of 2 percent of GDP reinforced by NATO
members at the 2014 Wales Summit

### A2: G7 Thumper

#### the g7 hurt America 

**Taussig 6-17 - is the director of and a senior fellow at the
Transatlantic Security Initiative in the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security. Previously, she was a director for
European affairs on the National Security Council**. (Torrey Taussig,
6-17-2025, \"What did not happen at the G7 Summit in Canada (and why it
matters)\", Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-did-not-happen-at-the-g7-summit-in-canada-and-why-it-matters/

What didn't happen sometimes matters more than what did. On Tuesday
afternoon, the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Alberta, Canada, concluded,
but [US President Donald Trump had left the day before, jetting back to
Washington as the war between Israel and Iran intensified]{.underline}.
[Trump's attendance for the full two-day summit was not the only thing
that didn't go as planned]{.underline}---several expected meetings and
outcomes were canceled as well. Below, Atlantic Council experts examine
four things that did not happen and what each nonevent reveals about the
relevant issue.

1\. The G7 did not release a joint communiqué

The absence of a joint communiqué at this week's G7 summit starkly
illustrates the deepening policy divisions among leaders of the world's
most powerful economies. [While policymakers debate what the G7 can
accomplish amid growing US-European tensions, a more fundamental
question has emerged]{.underline}: Is the G7 itself equipped to address
today's complex geopolitical landscape?

[The summit exposed significant rifts between G7 members and the United
States on critical international issues]{.underline}. [Trump's assertion
that ejecting Russia from the former Group of Eight (G8) was a strategic
mistake]{.underline} amplified tensions over Russia's war in Ukraine.
While the G7 did endorse a statement calling for "de-escalation of
hostilities, including a ceasefire in Gaza," watered down statements
like this underscore the challenges in achieving consensus. These
parallel conflicts reveal not only [internal G7 divisions but also the
growing disconnect between G7 positions and broader global
sentiment,]{.underline} especially when it comes to Israel and Gaza.

The lead-up to the Kananaskis summit highlighted another critical
question: Can the G7 remain relevant while excluding major global
players? [Pressure from G7 leaders ultimately compelled Canadian Prime
Minister Mark Carney to extend an invitation to Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi]{.underline}, despite ongoing diplomatic tensions over
last year's killing of a Khalistani separatist in British Columbia. This
last-minute inclusion underscores an emerging reality---as one of the
world's largest economies, a crucial node in global supply chains, and a
key player in Indo-Pacific security, India's absence from major G7
discussions would render many outcomes meaningless.

Perhaps most troubling is [the weakening of the shared democratic values
that supposedly bind the G7 together]{.underline}. The [transatlantic
relationship faces unprecedented strain as the Republican Party, under
the leadership of Trump]{.underline} and Vice President JD Vance,
increasingly views liberal European societies through a harsh cultural
lens. While the United States frames China as the primary geopolitical
challenge of its time, [today's Republican Party often sees European
societies as equally divergent from American values and
interests]{.underline}. This ideological drift threatens the very
foundation upon which the G7 was built.

[These developments raise existential questions about the G7's future
relevance]{.underline}. A forum designed for the world's democratic
economic powerhouses now struggles to produce basic agreements, while
excluding nations essential to global stability and prosperity. Today,
the G7 risks becoming an increasingly irrelevant talking shop, much like
the United Nations Security Council, unable to address many of the
defining challenges of the twenty-first century.

#### but it benefited Canada

**Boynton 6-14 - national online journalist with Global News** (Sean
Boynton, 6-14-2025, \"What are the stakes for Canada as it hosts the G7
leaders' summit?\", Global News,
https://globalnews.ca/news/11234110/g7-summit-canada-stakes-carney-trump/

[Carney last week announced what he said were Canada's priorities for
discussions at the G7 summit, all of which are aimed at "building
stronger economies."]{.underline}

The Prime Minister's Office said [Ottawa's top priority will be
strengthening global peace and security]{.underline}, which includes
countering foreign interference and transnational crime, as well as
improving responses to wildfires.

[Canada will focus on spurring economic growth by improving energy
security]{.underline}, fortifying supply chains for critical minerals
and accelerating the use of artificial intelligence.

Lastly, Canada will discuss creating jobs by securing partnerships to
open new markets and generate large infrastructure investments.

[G7 finance ministers and central bank governors who gathered in Banff
last month ahead of the leaders' summit agreed to cooperate on pursuing
economic growth, ensuring price stability and certainty, tackling
financial crime, and supporting Ukraine.]{.underline}

"I would consider any communique that contains any substantive
collective agreements on major issues to be a triumph, with a bland
document the most likely outcome," Sens told Global News.

David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, told
Global News that Trump's influence will likely mean past issues of
agreement --- including shared initiatives on the environment and
"equity, diversity, and inclusion" --- will either be less prominent or
reduced altogether.

Yet he still believes agreements can be struck among the allies on
issues of shared importance that go beyond the tensions Trump's tariffs
have caused --- particularly on energy security and artificial
intelligence.

The PMO said discussions will also include securing peace in Ukraine and
other global conflicts, as well as "a forward-looking agenda that
engages partners beyond the G7."

Who else will attend?

Other world leaders whose countries are not part of the G7 but who will
attend the summit are the heads of Mexico, Brazil, South Korea,
Australia, South Africa and Ukraine.

The attendance of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will mark the
first time North American leaders will be together since Trump's trade
wars threatened the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement on free trade
(CUSMA) that's up for review next year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will ensure talks at
the summit and other high-level gatherings in the weeks ahead don't lead
to "hollow" agreements on the war in his country.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also attend at Carney's
invitation, a move that has attracted criticism from diaspora groups in
Canada --- including members of Carney's Liberal caucus.

Modi's government has been accused of being involved in violence and
intimidation against Sikh activists and politicians in Canada, including
the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in 2023.

Carney's government also invited Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed
Bin Salman to the summit, Global News has learned, but the Saudi leader
has not yet publicly accepted the invitation.

NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson accused the government of
turning the summit into a "showcase of tyrants" with the invitations of
bin Salman and Modi during question period on Tuesday.

Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand responded that the G7 is "a
critical forum for global leaders to have productive and frank
discussions."

Vina Nadjibulla, vice-president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of
Canada, said Trump's election and the growing threat environment
requires a "different approach" to diplomatic relations, which is on
display under Carney.

The invitation to Modi was particularly necessary, she said, given the
size of India's economy and strategic importance. She added that
restoring the relationship with India could lead to further cooperation
on the issue of transnational violence and foreign interference.

"I think we need to recognize that in today's more dangerous world, we
need to be able to engage and have high-level talks with counties with
whom we have serious disagreements," she told Global News.

"Diplomacy is not a favour to our friends --- it's a tool to advance our
interests and protect our values."

Why Canada\'s leadership matters

[Perry said Canada will have its work cut out in chairing the G7, but
agreed the timing was good that the responsibility came up this year,
with Trump's trade war still in its early stages.]{.underline}

"[You do get to have a role in shaping things, and you do get to find
yourself at a table that you arranged, literally, for a discussion that
you helped set the agenda of, with the leaders of ... most of the major
economies in the world, including the president of the United
States,]{.underline}" he said.

["It's a pretty unique role and opportunity for Canada."]{.underline}

Canada needs to unlock the Arctic --- now\", financialpost,
https://financialpost.com/feature/want-canada-to-win-unlock-the-arctic-now)

[Given that all roads lead to Donald Trump lately, it is no mystery why.
In launching a trade war against Canada, the United States is no longer
a friendly ally and that is a driving reason behind why the narrative
around roads that do not get built in the Arctic has shifted to one that
Canada better start building roads, deepwater ports, naval
installations, mines, power grids and fibre-optic networks as soon as
possible or risk ceding its Arctic sovereignty and a northern treasure
house of critical minerals to a foreign power.]{.underline}

Some of that treasure takes the form of gold, which is currently trading
at around US\$3,000 an ounce. Canadian gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines
Ltd. believes its Hope Bay property in the Nunavut could produce as much
as 400,000 ounces per year.

The Northwest Territories, meanwhile, is peppered with more than 1,200
active mining claims, while Nunavut is believed to be home to up to 30
per cent of Canada's petroleum reserves and Yukon is ranked as a top 10
region worldwide in terms of its mineral endowment, according to the
Fraser Institute's 2023 annual survey of mining companies. All told, the
conversation around what all the untapped northern bounty could be worth
begins in the trillions.

/The Canadian Press

Evidence of this newfound sense of urgency to stop talking about the
Arctic and start doing things keeps popping up in Nunavut. Liberal
Leader Mark Carney, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP head
Jagmeet Singh have all stopped in Iqaluit in recent weeks. Depending
upon which party platform you pull from, the politicians have committed
to more infrastructure, better collaboration with the Inuit, increased
military spending, investing in energy upgrades and adequate housing and
boosting Canada's capability to unleash the North's economic potential.

"Canadians used to be fond of the old Winston Churchill quote about
Americans that they will ultimately do the right thing after trying
everything else," Bell said. "[But as it pertains to the Arctic, Canada
has literally tried everything else]{.underline}. We have tried ignoring
it. We have tried underinvesting in its communities and in its
infrastructure. [We have tried letting the Americans be responsible for
our continental defence]{.underline}. And, at last, [we can see now that
it just isn't sustainable. The mood of the country has
changed."]{.underline}

Being ticked off at Trump and [expressing your patriotism]{.underline}
by buying Canadian products at the grocery store [is a much more
straightforward and inexpensive way of taking control of your fate than
supercharging the economic development of the North]{.underline}. As the
old saying goes, you need to start somewhere, but outside of a few mines
dotted here and there, developing the North has barely begun at all
despite decades of promises to make it happen.

Whether the current generation can drum up the will and the cash to
finally dig in and get big, ambitious projects done, [ones that drive
Arctic and national prosperity while safeguarding Canada from
international bullies, could determine the country's long-term
fate]{.underline}.

If that sounds alarmist, it is worth having a brief chat with Rob
Huebert, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, about the
Northwest Passage. In the days of yore, this shortcut between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans stoked the imagination of explorers, who
would set off in search of an ice-free route and often get stuck in the
ice.

Nowadays, the passage is navigable for a stretch of time in the summer
and fall. The theory holds that as the world warms up and more sea ice
melts, the passage will become an increasingly attractive shipping lane,
so controlling it is key. [Canada's position is that the Northwest
Passage belongs to Canada. The Americans, to paraphrase, have long
claimed the passage as international waters.]{.underline}

In practice, the disagreement between neighbours has been a remarkably
polite affair. A U.S. ship has never entered the passage without first
informing the Canadians what it is up to. Granted, Americans tell rather
than ask for permission, but they also typically request a Canadian
icebreaker be somewhere nearby in case they run into any problems with
the ice.

"The Americans have always understood the Northwest Passage as a
security issue, which has meant keeping the Soviets, and now the
Russians, away," Huebert said.

[We are now in a situation where we are completely exposed in the
North]{.underline}

Rob Huebert, political scientist, University of Calgary

The Americans have also historically done the heavy lifting in terms of
keeping the Russians away, allowing Canada to blissfully flake out and,
until last year, classify the Arctic as an "area of exceptional" peace,
despite Russia having an extensive network of military bases and several
nuclear-powered icebreakers at its disposal.

"The Russian threat is clearly understood," Huebert said. "[Now, all of
a sudden, you get Trump back and he has shown a willingness to throw his
allies under the bus, and he's also threatening the existence of
Canada]{.underline}. We are now in a situation where we are completely
exposed in the North."

#### The United States Arctic policy has been the main stumbling block preventing Canada from becoming a primary leader

[Canadian diplomats recognized that pushing for clarity and trying to
secure American and other countries' acquiescence to Canadian claims was
not a straightforward matter.]{.underline} As the Legal Division
reported to the acting under-secretary on 23 February 1954, a formal
solicitation carried ["an implication that we may have some doubts
regarding our sovereignty in the absence of formal recognition by
foreign states."]{.underline} 48 Another departmental memorandum noted
that it was almost a "certainty that the United States would not concede
such a claim and that the world at large would not acquiesce in it. [It
would therefore seem preferable not to raise the problem now and to
implicitly reserve our position in granting permission for the U.S. to
carry out work in Canadian territorial waters]{.underline}." It made
more sense for Canada to reach agreements with Washington on "the
unstated assumption that 'territorial waters' in that area means
whatever we may consider to be Canadian territorial waters, whereas the
U.S. does likewise."49 Provoking protests from foreign countries would
hardly serve Canada's national interests, and the longer Canada
exercised authority the stronger its claims would become. [Canada could
not pretend to exist in a vacuum, its sovereignty issues divorced from
broader geostrategic considerations.]{.underline} Claiming a twelvemile
territorial sea, for example, would place Canada in conflict with
British challenges to the Soviet Union regarding fishing rights up to a
three-mile limit.50 As a member of the Commonwealth and fellow North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, Canada was not anxious to
undermine Britain's position. In addition, transits of the Northwest
Passage by U.S. Navy submarines demonstrated the great strategic
importance of the Arctic to Canada's closest defence partner. The Arctic
Ocean, covered by a dense and noisy ice pack, sheltered submarines from
aerial surveillance and sonar detection -- important considerations with
the introduction of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).
[Commander James F. Calvert of the submarine USS Skate told public
audiences that the United States could "best hold its world leadership
by gaining superiority in the Arctic," and that the Arctic waters would
soon become an "entirely nuclear sub-ocean." While this was not official
policy, it indicated to Canadian officials that the American government
would take "ever increasing interest" in the region.51 What imperative
was there for Canada to act unilaterally and adopt straight baselines to
close off its Arctic waters]{.underline}, in advance of international
law, and with little regard for its allies' interests? In 1958, the
International Conference on the Law of the Sea adopted Article 4 of the
Convention on Territorial Waters, which provided for a straight baseline
system to delimit its territorial sea. This, in conjunction with the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision in the Anglo-Norwegian
Fisheries Case (1951), might apply to the waters of the channels between
the islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago -- but not to the Polar
Basin lying north of Canadian land territories. Canada had insisted
during the deliberations that the baselines not be limited to
twenty-four miles, given that bridging the straits between the Arctic
islands would require "much longer baselines than that -- the longest
across Viscount Melville Sound would be about 200 miles." Such legal
ambiguity meant that boldness would not necessarily serve in Canada's
best interests.52 In 1959, Gordon Robertson presciently speculated that
in the future, the discovery of resources in the archipelago, the
closing of the Panama Canal, or the development of an open polar sea
might raise the stakes and incline Canada to act unilaterally.53
Robertson's analysis was sound and remains as pertinent today as it was
in 1959. [It was, of course, inherently speculative, and to cajole
allies on the basis of hypothetical threats to national sovereignty
rooted in questionable legal claims to water (rather than physical
security threats) would be unrealistic and difficult.]{.underline} By
the late 1950s, External Affairs saw "little advantage and numerous
disadvantages to the assertion by Canada of the claim to the waters of
the \[Polar Basin lying north of the Canadian mainland\], at least at
the present time," because "it would undoubtedly stir up international
controversy." International law did not justify it, and the conditions
in the region made such a claim "next to impossible to enforce." [By
contrast, it saw a strong case for asserting Canadian sovereignty over
the waters between the Arctic islands. The "main stumbling block" would
be the United States, which would presumably insist upon "free
navigation" through the Northwest Passage.]{.underline} "[However, it is
not impossible perhaps that quiet negotiations with the United States
leading to the granting of special privileges in ... these waters might
achieve reluctant acquiescence from them."]{.underline} In conclusion,
Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs Norman Robertson, who had
recently returned to Ottawa after a stint as the ambassador in
Washington, "[thought that it would be in no nation's interest to invite
an international wrangle, comparable perhaps to the one now going on
concerning the Antarctic, by laying controversial claims to the waters
and ice of the Arctic Basin]{.underline}."54 In the 1960s, Lester
Pearson's Liberal government continued to officially endorse a
three-mile territorial sea, [but it also announced its intention to
expand its control beyond those limits by unilaterally creating a
nine-mile fishing zone adjacent to its three-mile territorial
sea]{.underline}. Although the government introduced legislation to this
effect and instituted an exclusive fishing zone based upon straight
baselines along the east and west coasts, it retreated from making any
moves to do the same in the Arctic. The [government knew that the United
States would object if Canada made any internal waters claim or declared
straight baselines]{.underline}, but it hoped that the Americans might
support an extension of Canada's claim to Arctic waters for reasons of
defence and national security. [The United States, however, reacted
sharply, fearing that any move in the Arctic could set a dangerous
precedent.]{.underline} [The Canadian government thus retreated from its
plans, and Canada did not officially issue any geographical coordinates
to delineate its claim to baselines in the Arctic for another
twenty-three years.55]{.underline}

#### And American policy prevents Canada from asserting their own leadership in the Arctic

If we focus our view on disintegrating elements, then contradictions
also come to light[. For example, Canada's strategy emphasizes its
enduring sovereignty in the Arctic and the need to strengthen its
military presence.]{.underline} [Disputes over issues such as the status
of the Northwest Passage contribute to potential tensions across borders
and have implications for political, trade, and security
cooperation]{.underline}. Since 2010, regulations in the Northern Canada
Vessel Traffic Service Area require ships to register with the Canadian
Coast Guard to navigate the passage. [The dispute over the Northwest
Passage could further strain cross-border relations, affecting bilateral
cooperation in politics, trade, and security]{.underline}. The national
strategies of the US allies and partners in the Arctic reveal a complex
landscape characterized by shared security commitments and differing
interests. While there is a shared commitment to security in the Arctic
and shared concerns about Chinese and Russian actions, [there are
diverging views on issues such as free navigation and territorial
sovereignty that complicate the region's political
dynamics.]{.underline} Our analysis of military exercises in the Arctic
region conducted by the US allies and NATO partners highlights their
significant strategic value. A notable investment by the United States
has been the rotational presence of Marines in Norway since 2017, which
has gradually expanded over time. This presence near the
Norwegian-Russian border, initially with around 300 Marines and later
increased to 700, demonstrates the Marine Corps' commitment to NATO's
security and that of Norway. This rotational presence showcases the
geopolitical influence that even modest forces can exert simply through
their presence. Nordic countries' participation in NATO exercises, such
as "Trident Juncture" in 2018, has been significant (Wegge, 2020). The
Norwegian Army's "Nord" Brigade participated in the "North Wind"
exercise in northern Sweden in 2019, and joint training programs involve
regular flights with Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish fighter jets over
the North Calotte region. This cooperative training has further evolved
with the "Arctic Challenge" exercise (ACE), now one of Europe's largest
air force exercises. Overall, these military exercises conducted by the
US allies and NATO partners in the Arctic region demonstrate their
collaborative efforts to enhance regional security, promote
interoperability, and maintain deterrence. By strengthening defense
capabilities and influencing regional security dynamics, these exercises
play a pivotal role in preserving stability and safeguarding the
interests of the Arctic states and their allies. The US military bases
in the Arctic region, including the Pituffik SB in Greenland and the
Keflavik air base in Iceland, hold significant importance in the US
Arctic policy and contribute to its strategic objectives. The Pituffik
SB offers strategic value for several reasons. Firstly, it houses an
essential early warning radar system that provides strategic alerts and
space surveillance, detecting ballistic missile launches and monitoring
space objects. Secondly, its strategic location in the Arctic region
allows the US to monitor activities in the area, including those of
rival nations like Russia and China. Thirdly, the base supports military
operations and scientific research, facilitating telemetry, tracking,
and satellite access (U.S. Department of Defense, 2020a). Additionally,
the base contributes to scientific research in the Arctic, particularly
in atmospheric science, climate models, and weather observations,
providing valuable data for ongoing research and climate monitoring
efforts (U.S. Department of Defense, 2020b). Similarly, the Keflavik Air
Base in Iceland plays a crucial role in deterring Russian long-range
bombers and serves as a gateway to the North Atlantic and the East Coast
of North America. Its location in the GIUK gap highlights its strategic
significance in protecting vital areas and providing the US with
essential access to key air and sea routes (Miller, 2022). The US
commitment to maintaining and enhancing military infrastructure in
Iceland is evident through recent contracts awarded by the US Air Force
Installation and Mission Support Center to upgrade the airfield
infrastructure at the Naval Air Station Keflavik. These projects align
with the European Deterrence Initiative, aimed at strengthening the
readiness and responsiveness of the US Air Force, the NATO forces and
the European allies (Cisneros, 2020). These bases provide crucial early
warning systems, enhance the geopolitical landscape, support military
operations and scientific research, and ensure security and stability.
The Arctic region has gained significant attention due to its strategic
importance, abundance of natural resources, and geopolitical dynamics.
In the context of international relations, the Arctic is considered a
complex system that encompasses various military-political
organizations. It is important to emphasize that the new enlargement of
the NATO, namely the accession of Finland and Sweden to the Alliance,
brings new capabilities. Both countries offer valuable resources and
expertise in the Arctic infrastructure development, military
cooperation, polar research and Arctic cooperation initiatives (Kopra
and Wall, 2022). Finland's recent purchase of 64 F-35A fighters further
enhances its air force capabilities. Sweden holds a strategic advantage
with a modern Air Force, Patriot anti-missile systems and submarines.
Also the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is strategically
located near the Russian Baltic Fleet headquarters in Kaliningrad
(Forsberg et al., 2022). The armed forces of Sweden and Finland are
highly capable of conducting military operations in Arctic conditions,
participating in regular intensive exercises in the snowy forests of
Scandinavia. Finland's accession to NATO addresses a significant defense
gap and extends the length of the NATO's borders with Russia (Patassini,
2023). At the same time, there are also negative consequences of
Finland's accession. The NATO membership can be seen as a signal that
Finland is getting too close to the US, which could undermine its
credibility as a neutral and non-aligned state. This may make it
difficult for Finland to act as an intermediary---i.e., the loss of
Helsinki the status of a neutral negotiating platform. Along with Vienna
and Geneva, the Finnish capital hosted the most difficult summits and
negotiations in extremely difficult historical circumstances. The North
American Aerospace Defense Command plays a vital role in aerospace and
maritime warning for North America. The NORAD, similar to any complex
military system, possesses weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be
exploited by adversaries or competitors. It is worth noting that
Command's radar coverage has a limited range, making it unable to detect
and track aircraft beyond that range, thereby posing challenges in
detecting threats originating from outside the region and the Arctic.
Despite utilizing numerous sensors and radars, the system has
limitations and may not effectively detect certain types of threats such
as stealth aircrafts, low-flying aircrafts, or drones. Moreover, the
cost of maintaining and upgrading the NORAD system can be substantial,
necessitating adequate funding from both the US and Canada to ensure its
efficiency and reliability. Some technologies within the system
Frontiers in Political Science 10 frontiersin.org Dauylbayev et al.
10.3389/fpos.2024.1341375 are decades old and may face issues of
obsolescence or failure, leading to costly and time-consuming upgrades.
Strengthening the NORAD's capabilities aligns with the broader efforts
to address security challenges and protect the US interests in the
Arctic. By pooling resources, sharing experiences, and leveraging
technological advancements, these allies strengthen their collective
defense, deterrence, and overall security in the Arctic. However, the
United States' icebreaking fleet is significantly weaker than that of
other Arctic nations, particularly Russia. With only two active
icebreakers, maintaining a robust surface presence in the Arctic is a
concern (Lopez, 2022). In this context, the preceding administration of
the United States, under the leadership of President Trump, brought
attention to the matter of icebreakers. In June 2020, a memorandum was
issued, advocating for the expeditious enlargement of the U.S.
icebreaker fleet. This directive urged relevant departments to explore
the potential establishment or leasing of icebreakers from foreign
shipbuilders. Additionally, the memorandum stipulated the need to
identify both domestic and two international facilities for the mooring
of these icebreakers (Administration of Donald J. Trump, 2020).
Fortunately, some of the NATO Arctic states have icebreaking
capabilities and can contribute to the alliance's icebreaking fleet.
Finland, known for advanced icebreaking technology, has proficient
icebreaking shipyards that can construct heavy icebreakers, including
combat icebreakers, for the United States. Finnish shipyards like Aker
Arctic Technology, Helsinki Shipyard Oy, and Turku Repair Yard have a
strong track record in building icebreakers. Finland possesses a
significant number of icebreakers and is a global leader in icebreaking,
having designed and built a substantial share of the world's icebreakers
(Publications of the Finnish Government, 2020). Sweden also has valuable
experience and operates five icebreakers, including a heavy icebreaker,
which can support commercial shipping growth, environmental monitoring,
and Arctic research (Swedish Maritime Administration, 2021).
[Territorial disputes are a significant factor that can strain relations
among Arctic countries and create disagreements among
partners]{.underline}. [Arctic nations, including Canada, are using
updated seabed maps to pursue claims for expanded continental shelves
and assert sovereignty over additional territory, particularly for
mining purposes. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea, countries can potentially extend their Exclusive Economic
Zones (EEZ) by demonstrating that their continental shelf extends beyond
the EEZ. The competition for the North Pole has intensified, with Canada
being the third country to assert sovereignty, supported by scientific
evidence, over a substantial portion of the Arctic Ocean, including the
North Pole itself]{.underline}. The successful claimant would also gain
control over ∼55,000 square miles of surrounding sea. [These competing
claims create tensions among NATO allies. An example of such tensions
was the disputed status of Hans Island between Denmark and Canada. The
economic interests of individual Arctic partners present strategic risks
and threats to the collective security of Arctic allies]{.underline}.
Chinese investments in certain Arctic countries have reached a level
where they can significantly influence the local economy and potentially
shape these nations' policies. The involvement of Chinese companies in
sensitive and strategic sectors, such as mining projects in Greenland,
raises concerns for the United States and its allies. The United States
is also concerned about Iceland's relationship with China, as it sees
potential implications for regional security and economic interests
(Cronin, 2021). Iceland's cooperation with China in Arctic management is
viewed cautiously by the US. China's economic involvement in Iceland,
including investments in critical infrastructure and technology, raises
concerns about China's activities in the Arctic and its potential for
military expansion (Chess, 2019; Parsons, 2022). China's efforts to
enhance terrestrial and satellite communications in the Arctic raise
concerns about shipping safety and potential military interests. The
shared state borders between the Arctic allies and the Russian
Federation are a significant factor that cannot be overlooked when
considering regional security and collective interests. Allies that
share a border with Russia face specific military risks that have the
potential to create divisions within the alliance. The proximity to
Russian military installations also poses security challenges that
require individual responses. For instance, Norway's role as a
"listening post" for NATO on the alliance's northern flank makes it
particularly vulnerable in case of deteriorating relations with Russia.
Its common land and sea border with Russia necessitate the importance of
engaging in dialogue with Moscow. It is crucial to differentiate between
the Arctic and the "Far North" in terms of the border with Russia and
the security issues associated with having a resurgent neighbor. Norway
strives to address its military gap with Russia through NATO membership
and bilateral relations with the United States in what is commonly
described as an asymmetric relationship.

#### Canada MUST act independently from America to build their own global leadership

to NATO from 2015-2018. She is currently a Senior Fellow at the
University of Ottawa and the Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary
International History at Trinity College, University of Toronto** (Kerry

Sovereignty in a 'Leaderless\' World\", Policy Magazine,
https://www.policymagazine.ca/crafting-a-new-canadian-foreign-policy-strategic-sovereignty-in-a-leaderless-world/)

[Right now, almost all of Canada's foreign policy discussion, strategy
and collective brainpower is focused on Donald Trump's second
presidency.]{.underline} This is smart -- there is a high risk that
President Trump will cause significant damage to, or at least disruption
of, Canada's economy, our security and the global structure we have
relied on since the end of the Second World War.

[So, it is clear that our diplomacy and foreign policy have to
adapt.]{.underline}

But defining Canada's foreign policy has been difficult for us even at
the best of times. We haven't had a foreign policy review since 2005.
Part of the challenge has been the historical tension in our foreign
policy between a desire to carve out Canada's own space on the global
stage and the need to align with the U.S. [Today, the job of defining
our foreign policy has become even more difficult, primarily because
America's global leadership role is changing in ways that are difficult
to predict.]{.underline}

While Canada needs to adapt its foreign policy to be ready for a changed
world, the problem is that the eventual shape of that changed world is
far from clear. What Canada needs to do differently will depend on what
we're trying to manage. Many say President Trump is an isolationist. I'm
not convinced. He's a disruptor but he also likes 'winning', Thus, his
promises to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours, or his odd threats to annex
Greenland, Panama and Canada. So, it is not at all clear what US foreign
policy will look like for the next four years.

[If Trump means what he's been saying in the early days of his
presidency, then his foreign policy will be marked by an extreme form of
U.S. exceptionalism and the use of American power in an unrestrained or
unilateral way. If his foreign policy ends up being more about U.S.
isolationism, then this would cause the US to turn away from its
traditional global leadership role]{.underline}. Either way, Canada has
to adjust its strategic, tactical and conceptual approach to Canadian
foreign policy.

[This requirement to adapt is not just a reaction to an American
President seemingly bent on being even more disruptive and unpredictable
than he was in his first term]{.underline}. Regardless of who is in the
White House, the U.S. willingness (or power) to act as a global leader
has been weakening over the past decade or more, and it will continue to
weaken. [This is because the global landscape has fundamentally changed
since the international system we rely on today was first
established.]{.underline}

[The exercise of global leadership has become increasingly
difficult]{.underline}: with a five-fold growth in the number of states;
many states turning away from multilateral solutions and toward
nationalism and protectionism; economic and political power moving from
West to East and North to South; states like China, India and Russia
contesting the American role and others from the Global South choosing
not to align with either the US or its competitors. [The weakening of
American global leadership predates Trump, it will likely be exacerbated
by him, and it will outlast him.]{.underline}

If Trump means what he's been saying in the early days of his
presidency, then his foreign policy will be marked by an extreme form of
U.S. exceptionalism and the use of American power in an unrestrained or
unilateral way.

For many of the same reasons, some argue that the space today for
Canadian influence is more constrained. [While this is true, it does not
mean that Canada cannot and should not set itself up to have a shaping
ro]{.underline}le. [The stark alternative is to focus inward and ---
depending on how the bilateral relationship with the U.S. unfolds ---
assume a subordinate role within "Fortress North America" or a more
vulnerable one as "Island Canada".]{.underline}

In a world with new centres of power, weakening international
institutions and interconnected threats that cannot be addressed without
cooperative solutions, [Canada has no choice but to avoid overdependence
on the U.S. in our foreign policy choices and develop greater strategic
sovereignty]{.underline}. [Above all, the aim should be to rebuild
Canada's strategic culture and confidence. Defining the national
interests that drive our international policy priorities would give
decision-makers a strategic framework to decide when we would part
company with the U.S. and when we would align. This is what I mean by
"strategic sovereignty".]{.underline}

So, how do we achieve strategic sovereignty? I argue that Canadian
international policy makers should ask three key questions:

[First, as American global leadership wavers]{.underline}, what impact
will this have on the relative importance of Canada's global engagement
when compared to our bilateral relationship with the U.S.? There is a
longstanding thread running through Canada's foreign policy --- a
dividing line between the public policy choices we see as necessary and
those we see as optional. This walks back to our immense and
longstanding reliance on the US as the anchor of our economy and
continental security. While we see engagement with the US almost as
domestic policy that is both existential and necessary, aside from the
early post-WWII years, [the rest of our foreign policy and defence
engagement abroad has largely been seen as optional.]{.underline} If we
are safe and prosperous in Fortress North America, then we can pay less
attention to geopolitics.

This approach might have made eminent sense throughout some of our
history but it is not tenable any more. The direct costs of events such
as climate disasters, the Covid pandemic or the Russian war in Ukraine
to Canada's economic and security interests are undeniable. "[Fortress
North America" will no longer afford us the security or economic
dividends it once did. As geographic distance is collapsing, Canada
needs to start seeing international engagement not as optional but
rather in Canada's existential interest.]{.underline}

We will always be tied to the U.S. because of our geography, but Canada
must consistently and consciously choose when it is in our national
interest to diverge from aligning our international policy positions
with the U.S. [To do this, as I argue above, we need a clearer
articulation of our national interests and the development of a more
confident strategic culture. We also need to have the tools and
expertise to engage internationally in a strategic way that responds to
those national interests.]{.underline}

While the second Trump presidency has crystallized these urgencies, the
problem is that we have significantly underinvested in our tools of
international engagement --- defence, development, trade and foreign
policy. A quick survey of the budgets of our international departments
over the past thirty years shows investments that have declined
significantly in real terms --- in development and foreign policy/trade
--- or that have failed significantly to keep pace with allies and
heightened security risks --- defence.

The NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, July, 2024/NATO image

S[econd, how we should adapt our own global engagement to take into
account a less-engaged U.S.? For middle powers such as Canada, bodies
like NATO, the UN or the G7 act as force multipliers, enhancing
levera]{.underline}ge. We have used them effectively in the past to try
to keep the U.S. engaged internationally, build cross-regional,
issues-based alliances to support Canadian interests and initiatives, or
to build new norms to temper extremes of state behaviour. Think of the
landmines treaty, children's rights, maternal and child health, human
security, or the creation of NATO. On most of these issues, Canada took
a conscious policy choice to promote an initiative that ran counter to,
or pushed beyond, U.S. positions.

However, the role of the U.S. in the global architecture we've relied on
since the end of the Second World War is now fraying and transforming in
ways that will inevitably make it harder for Canada to navigate
internationally. Again, this is not a development that has just surfaced
with the second Trump Presidency. U.S. influence in multilateral bodies
has been steadily shifting over the past few years, owing to a number of
different push and pull factors. American leadership has been
incrementally crowded out by competitors, notably China. Acutely aware
that the UN is an ecosystem and that what you say in one forum will echo
in other negotiations --- China uses this to rewrite the rules, taking
advantage of Western lack of coherence. And many more states are now
occupying a 'middle space' at the U.N., "forum shopping" for the right
alliances, depending on the issue and their interests and not
automatically aligning with traditional Western or other negotiating
blocs, so states wanting to exercise leadership have to work harder to
build support.

The U.S. has also increasingly chosen to be less 'multilateralist' in
its orientation. During his first term, President Trump repudiated
alliances like NATO and withdrew the U.S. from the WHO and the Paris
Agreement. President Biden also, albeit with a different tone, focused
less on global bodies like the UN in favour of purpose-built US-led fora
like the Democracy Summit or the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. In
sum, where the U.S. used to act as a multilateralist in a unipolar
world, for more than the past decade it has been acting as a
unilateralist in a multipolar world. And this is not about to change. It
is highly likely that the approach to multilateralism under the second
Trump term will continue to include a repudiation of American treaty
commitments, condemnation of multilateral institutions and alliances,
and a view of the liberal international order as being dominated by
globalist elites.

This will have a profound impact on Canadian foreign policy, which has
traditionally had multilateralism at its core. And yet turning away from
multilateralism to focus inward or rely on our bilateral relationships
to protect Canadian interests would inevitably result in a weakening of
Canada's global stature and leverage, in turn lessening our capacity to
exercise influence bilaterally. **[A sounder strategic approach would be
to maintain Canada's focus on multilateralism, focusing on those issues
that both correspond to Canada's core interests and fill in gaps in
international norms, some of which will have been created by the U.S.
retreat.]{.underline}**

Third, how have Canadian interests, assets and vulnerabilities changed
as a result of the shift in the U.S. global leadership role and what
should Canada's international policy priorities be? [Canada must be able
to navigate a world where the gap is growing between, on the one hand,
what Canada needs and on the other, what America wants or is willing to
do: a world where the American security guarantee is less reliable; one
where America is hostile to free trade while Canada is a trading
nation;]{.underline} where America is alliance-skeptic while Canada
relies on alliances and partnerships [and where American democracy is
destabilizing and polarizing while Canada relies on resilient democracy
as a core Canadian value. In all of these areas, Canada is already more
vulnerable]{.underline}. Our foreign and security policy priorities
haven't adapted.

Canadian decision-makers should take a strategic, structured approach to
redefining our interests, vulnerabilities and assets. [An international
policy review should break down the barriers between international
strategy and national security and be integrative, spanning trade,
national security, defence, diplomacy, resilience and
development]{.underline}. My own personal short list for Canada's
international priorities that would both respond to increased
vulnerabilities and capitalize on Canadian strategic advantages would
be:

further diversifying our trade and investment partnerships, with an
emphasis on Indo-Pacific and sectors where Canada has a comparative edge
(eg. critical minerals, space, agri-food);

concentrating our security and defence efforts on our continent and
region, strengthening transatlantic collective defence and diversifying
our defence relationships in areas of particular vulnerability like the
Arctic;

building security and societal resilience by tackling cyber security,
democracy, foreign interference and disinformation; addressing climate
change (including food security) and

(re)building the international rules, organizations and guardrails that
directly touch on our economic and security interests (like emerging
technologies, nuclear non-proliferation, migration and human rights).

Ideally, the redefinition of our international priorities would involve
an open, public debate to engage Canadians and redefine our national
narrative on Canada's global role. While Canada has traditionally been
loath to write down its foreign policy, it has been even more averse to
engaging in broad public conversations on international issues. But
engaging Canadians makes sense now for a few reasons.

First, today's international security environment is the worst it has
been since the end of the Second World War and a public process would
build Canadians' security awareness. Second, a public process would
inform and build legitimacy for a new direction in Canada's
international policy. Most importantly, at the same time as Canadian
decision-makers will have to make significant commitments in defence and
border security to manage the bilateral relationship with the U.S.,
public engagement will help build the case for why this is in Canada's
longer-term national interest and not just a response to President
Trump.

Our default approach to international engagement has too often been to
wait until the U.S. asks before we step up internationally. The aim
should be for Canada to take a shaping role to build the open, stable
international environment that meets our national interests. If Canada's
global role today might be described as a "middle power with small-power
aspirations" the aim should be to align our level of ambition with
Canada's status as the worlds 9th largest economy, the 7th largest
military power in NATO, and a member of the G7.

#### The Arctic is the critical place for Canada to assert sovereignty

[The geophysical and political transformation of the Arctic region over
the past three decades has been extraordinary.]{.underline} The
responses from states, international organizations, sub-state actors,
and non-governmental organizations (as well as from outside observers
such as scholars and journalists) to these changes have reignited
debates about the core political concepts of sovereignty and security,
in addition to their distinctive features across the Circumpolar North.
"[The confluence of climate change and the end of the Cold War led the
Arctic states to reconsider their Arctic interests in light of the
changing geopolitical and physical environment, generating a wave of new
official foreign and security policies that continue to emphasize (in
many cases) Arctic states' central preoccupation with defending their
Arctic territory and sovereignty]{.underline}," Wilfrid Greaves and I
observed in a 2021 book. "Other actors, most notably Indigenous peoples
through their self-governing institutions and representative
organizations, have articulated conceptions of security and sovereignty
in the region that both support and challenge the priorities identified
by Arctic states." We noted that sovereignty and security are amongst
the most widely used -- and misused -- concepts in current debates.1 iv
Lackenbauer My introduction to the 2011 volume Canadian Arctic
Sovereignty and Security: Historical Perspectives framed various
dynamics and issues that have continued to garner news media headlines
and policy attention in Canada since that time. The Conservative
government of Stephen Harper insisted that previous governments had
failed to perfect Canadian sovereignty and that the country needed to
adopt a more activist approach to defend its national interests in the
region. "[Climate change is transforming the Arctic," I noted at the
time. "The ice cover on the Arctic Ocean is shrinking in breadth and
depth, permafrost is melting, and indigenous flora and fauna is
threatened. Questions abound about what these changes will mean for
northern peoples, for transportation routes, for international
boundaries, and for stability and security in the circumpolar
world.]{.underline}"2 Fast forward thirteen years, and the situation has
come full circle. When the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau came
to office in 2015, it initially avoided language around sovereignty and
security, believing that the Conservatives had managed to secure this as
part of their partisan "brand."3 This did not last long. [The Liberal
defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged, released in 2017, followed by
the safety, security, and defence chapter of the Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework (ANPF) in 2019, acknowledged national defence as a key
part of Canada's "commitment to a safe, secure, and well-defended Arctic
and North, and as a continued expression of Canada's enduring
sovereignty over our lands and waters]{.underline}."4 In an increasingly
competitive world following Russia's unprovoked fullscale invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022, strategic assessments regularly highlight that
authoritarian regimes in Moscow and Beijing threaten the rules-based
international order when it does not serve their interests. The
Kremlin's continued expansion and modernization of its Arctic military
infrastructure, development of new military capabilities that have the
potential to threaten the North American homeland (as well as allied and
partner territories), and the significant role that the Arctic Zone of
the Russian Federation plays in Russia's national security and economic
calculations mean that Russia cannot be ignored. China, for its part,
seeks increased access to and influence in the region. While analysts
debate how or why Russia or China might seek to disrupt the Arctic
order, there is a growing consensus that global strategic competition
spills over into the region. [Canadian statements reflect these
dynamics. "The most urgent and important task we face is asserting
Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic and northern regions," Canada's April
2024 defence policy update insisted, "where the changing physical and
geopolitical landscapes have created new threats and vulnerabilities to
Introduction v Canada and Canadians." 5 The emphasis on sovereignty
rather than security is telling.]{.underline} In the 2008 book Arctic
Front, co-authors and I described sovereignty as the "zombie -- the dead
issue that refuses to stay dead -- of Canadian public affairs." 6
[Insisting that "sovereignty" is imperilled allows politicians and
commentators to tap into primordial anxieties about Canada's ability to
preserve its ownership and control over its Arctic
inheritance]{.underline}. The contrast is striking with the
international chapter of the 2019 ANPF, which suggested that "the
circumpolar Arctic is well known for its high level of international
cooperation on a broad range of issues, a product of the robust
rules-based international order that is the sum of international rules,
norms and institutions that govern international affairs in the Arctic."
Prime among them is the law of the sea, which applies to the Arctic
Ocean like it does all other oceans. The [policy framework highlighted
that "Canada's Arctic sovereignty is longstanding and well established"
and that "the Government of Canada is firmly asserting its presence in
the North." This includes daily activities by governments, Indigenous
Peoples, and local communities who "express Canada's enduring
sovereignty over its Arctic lands and waters."7 Now, it seems, the
Government of Canada has replaced this confidence with a resurgent sense
of vulnerability and urgency.]{.underline}

[The US failure to adhere to the Law of the Sea Convention and to take
our seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority, with its
consensus procedures, means that we have already missed out on helping
to shape the rules and regulations for exploration of manga- nese
nodules.]{.underline} [Unless we join, we will have little opportunity
or in- fluence going forward in shaping the procedures for seabed
mineral exploitation which, with respect to manganese nodules, are now
near final development in the Authority, and for the rules and

issues con- cerning this new infant industry]{.underline}. Indeed, both

The world\'s oceans are teeming with life and valuable resources. In
[1982, the United Nations established UNCLOS to ensure fair and
sustainable management of those vast shared waters. UNCLOS acts as a
global rulebook]{.underline}. It governs safe ship passage, fair access
to ocean resources, and the protection of marine environments.

[Despite many nations becoming signatories to UNCLOS, the United States
opted against joining]{.underline}. That decision was driven by concerns
over certain clauses. These clauses required sharing mining technology
and profits with other nations. This clashed with U.S. commitments to
free-market principles and economic independence. Historically, the
United States tends to prefer bilateral agreements, valuing its ability
to navigate its affairs independently without being bound by overarching
international frameworks.

[By staying out of UNCLOS, the United States retains autonomy in its
maritime policies, offering flexibility and control. Supporters argue
that independence protects economic interests and allows strategic
maneuvering on the global stage. However, not being part of UNCLOS
limits the United States' ability to shape international ocean
regulations]{.underline}. Not joining could weaken the county's
influence on crucial security and economic issues. This is particularly
risky as China gains prominence among signatories of the convention.

#### UNCLOS accession cements American ocean leadership

At least since World War II, the United States, with the largest navy
and the largest economy in the world, and bordering three oceans, has
been a leader in oceans policy matters. [Thus, the United States was an
active participant in the first United Nations Conference on the Law of
the Sea leading to the 1958 Geneva Conventions (UNCLOS I), the failed
1960 United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS II), and
subsequent efforts to resolve the breadth of the territorial sea,
provide transit passage through in- ternational straits, enhance our
coastal fisheries jurisdiction, and rebut il- legal coastal state claims
interfering with navigational freedom. But during the Third United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), and its
preparatory work, the United States was the global leader in develop-
ment of oceans law and policy worldwide.]{.underline} Stemming in part
from its effective national organization of an eighteen-agency National
Security Council Interagency Task Force on the Law of the Sea through a
high level dedi- cated UNCLOS office D/LOS (subsequently copied by
Japan), [its leadership enabled effective policy decisions, steady
focus, initiative, and leadership in the international negotiations. It
was the United States that coordinated major developed countries,
negotiated solutions to key functional and re- gional issues, and
suggested the compromise enabling the Single Negotiating Text, without
which there likely would have been no Convention]{.underline}. Further,
the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, in firmly setting conditions
for a deep seabed mining regime (Part XI of the Convention), enabled the
sub- sequent successful renegotiation of Part XI. [The net effect of
this United States oceans leadership was both to dramatically serve
United States oceans interests and to promote a truly outstanding global
legal regime for the oceans. This new regime served the common interest
of all nations. However, American oceans leadership has been
significantly harmed by our absence from the Law of the Sea Convention
since its successful rene- gotiation in 1994.]{.underline} The reasons
for this malaise are many. [First, America has not been able to
participate in the new institutions we helped create in the Convention:
the International Seabed Authority, the Law of the Sea Tribunal, and the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We are thus failing
to participate in key oceans policy matters such as the rules of pro-
cedure for the Law of the Sea Tribunal]{.underline}, the policies of the
Shelf Commission in interpreting the limits of the extended shelf, or
the rules and regulations for seabed mining adopted by the Seabed
Authority. Of particular note, the environmental rules and regulations
governing deep seabed mining are of considerable importance and
contemporary interest, [and the United States can only effectively
participate in formulating these rules and regulations by taking its
guaranteed seat on the Council of the Seabed Authority as a party to
UNCLOS.]{.underline} Second, we are relegated to the status of observer
in the annual Meeting of states parties (States Party to the LOS
Convention), a crucial forum for oceans law matters that meets every
year to deal with contemporary oceans issues. [Third, as a non-party, we
have reduced our ef- fectiveness to participate in the important ongoing
negotiations within the United Nations concerning the Conservation and
Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity (the BBNJ negotiations).1
Fourth, our non-party status has delayed American industry and our own
government from actively en- gaging oceans challenges and
opportunitie]{.underline}s. For example, the United States was years
behind the Russian Federation, and even many developing states, in
beginning the scientific survey work necessary for delimitation of our
ex- tended continental shelf. At present, it is estimated that the
United States sci- entific effort will not be fully ready until 2022 or
even 2023 for submission to the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf. And, most op- timistically, it will be 2030, and
possibly years later, before the Commission will be able to consider the
US proposal. In contrast, the Russian Federation made an initial
submission in 2001 and revised submissions in 2013 and 2015, submissions
which at the time of writing were still in the Commission review
process. Finally, as a non-party to the core document responsible for
the rule of law in the oceans, the United States has lost negotiating
heft in oceans matters, whether in international fora such as the
International Maritime Organization, or in efforts at negotiating
bilateral or regional solutions to oceans problems. [Though intangible,
this downgrading of the earlier American oceans leadership is palpable
to any experienced observer.]{.underline} UNCLOS, regulating exploration
and exploitation of the resources of the deep ocean floor, regulates
exploration and exploitation of the "solid, liquid or gaseous mineral
resources in situ" of the deep ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction,
that is, beyond the extended continental shelf controlled by coastal
nations. It does not deal with the biological resources of the deep
ocean floor, particularly the flora and fauna found at seafloor
spreading centers, except as part of the marine environment that must be
protected in connection with "activities in the area." This absence has
given rise to an international initiative to negotiate an implementing
agreement that would supplement UNCLOS to deal with conservation and
sustainable development of the biological resources of the deep ocean
floor much as the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA)
implemented UNCLOS. The United Nations convened a working group on this
issue in 2006, and in 2015 the working group recommended that the United
Nations negotiate a binding international agreement. Pursuant to this
working group recommendation, the UN General Assembly established a
Preparatory Committee for an Intergovernmental Conference on BBNJ. This
"Prep Com" held two sessions each in 2016 and 2017, and at its fourth
session in July 2017, the "Prep Com" adopted its report to the General
Assembly. Following through, on December 24, 2017, the UN General
Assembly decided to con- vene an Intergovernmental Conference under the
auspices of the United Nations. This ongoing process is referred to as
the BBNJ negotiation; and more fully as "Development of an International
Legally-Binding Instrument under the UNCLOS on the Conservation and
Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National
Jurisdiction (BBNJ Process)." United States views, in- cluding US
opposition to extending the "common heritage" concept beyond mineral
resources, may be found in a 10-page written submission of issues under
discussion at the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee, September
9, 2016. As with the Fish Stocks Agreement, the United States has
participated in negotiations of these UNCLOS "implementing agreements,"
but given our non- party status with UNCLOS itself, United States
participation likely receives reduced attention and credence. The
Intergovernmental Conference on BBNJ held an organizational meeting in
New York in April 2018 and scheduled four substantive sessions, the
first held in September 2018, the second and third held in 2019, and the
fourth held in August 2021. As of 2022, and outlasting the COVID- 19
pandemic, the BBNJ negotiations are continuing with an even broader
agenda than initially contemplated. [It means, as this affects American
leadership going forward, that the United States may simply not be
engaged, that United States views may be accorded less weight, that US
démarches may be deflected, or that strategic rivals such as China will
fill the gap left by the United States. In turn, this means that United
States efforts to support the rule of law against lawbreakers likely
will be met with the counterargument that "you are not a party to the
Convention, why should we take your views seriously?" It also means that
our opportuni- ties to manage critical oceans change or to assist in
resolving ongoing oceans disputes are reduced. Two important
contemporary oceans matters are managing change in a thawing Arctic
Ocean and managing conflict in the South and East China Seas. Both
matters are of considerable importance to the United States and to the
world.]{.underline} Each will be examined below. On neither can the
United States af- ford to be marginalized. And both illustrate the
importance of US accession to UNCLOS.

#### UNCLOS is key to American leadership and dominance in the Arctic

Costs of Ignoring the Law of Sea Convention in the Arctic" Arctic
Security Initiative ,

This paper addresses these questions. The paper begins by briefly
surveying the extent to which the convention's provisions intersect with
United States interests in the Arctic. Not surprisingly, there is
extensive overlap. The paper then reviews arguments that UNCLOS is
irrelevant or even antithetical to achieving these important U.S.
interests. After critiquing the anti-UNCLOS arguments, the paper
examines the case for UNCLOS. [The paper focuses in particular on U.S.
interests on the Arctic seafloor, arguing that these interests are
extensive and that accession would help avert a wide range of potential
political, legal, and regulatory challenges from foreign governments and
corporations]{.underline}. The possibility of such challenges creates
political and legal uncertainty as long as the United States remains
outside the convention and provides a bona fide disincentive for
U.S.-licensed corporations to undertake the type of exploration and
development activities necessary to realize a host of offshore benefits.
[Moreover, by staying outside UNCLOS, the United States is forfeiting an
opportunity to reinforce a favorable Arctic legal regime that could face
pressure from non-Arctic nations in the future. The paper concludes by
recommending that the U.S. accede to UNCLOS at the soonest
opportunity.]{.underline}

### AT: Link Turn

#### The link turn assumes that Canada wants to work with Trump and is willing to revoke their own soverigty in the Arctic in favor of working with Trump -- that's wrong and contradicts every statement from the Carney government 

#### The link turn doesn't make sense -- Canada is actively working against American foreign policy now

**Yousif 6-2 -- Reporter at the BBC** (Nadine Yousif, 06-02-2025,
\"Canada to expedite nation-building projects to counter Trump\",
British Broadcasting Channel,
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrd24zg3eo)

[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government will start
pushing legislation that would fast-track ambitious national projects to
boost Canada\'s economy, now faced with Donald Trump\'s
tariffs.]{.underline}

Carney outlined his plan on Monday after a meeting - described as \"very
productive\" - with the leaders of Canada\'s provinces and territories.

\"This has been the best meeting we\'ve had in 10 years,\" Ontario
premier Doug Ford told reporters.

Carney said his plan is to narrow down a list of so-called \"nation
building\" projects - like pipelines, nuclear reactors and trade
corridors - and create a framework in which the projects would be
approved in under two years\' time.

[The goal, he said, is to quickly build infrastructure that will make
Canada \"the strongest economy in the G7,\" as well as strengthen the
country\'s autonomy and resilience in the future]{.underline}.

\"This meeting demonstrated how we can give ourselves far more than any
foreign government can take away,\" Carney told reporters.

Monday\'s meeting marked Carney\'s first with Canada\'s premiers since
his federal election win in April.

He had campaigned heavily on bolstering the country\'s economy to
counter tariff threats from the US, with whom Canada does the bulk of
its trade.

[President Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminium and
its auto sector, and said he plans to double levies on steel and
aluminium to 50%, starting on Wednesday to \"further secure the steel
industry in the United States.\"]{.underline}

[Carney called the latest tariffs \"unjustified and
unlawful\".]{.underline}

[He added that Canada\'s minister for US-Canada trade Dominic LeBlanc
will be travelling to the US on Monday evening to resume trade
talks.]{.underline}

[In the meantime, Carney said his government will focus on \"projects of
national interest\" to help Canada sell its resources in more markets,
strengthen its security and reduce reliance on other
nations.]{.underline}

These projects can come from provinces or the private sector, and must
meet a criteria that includes offering \"undeniable benefit\" to
Canada\'s economy and having \"a high likelihood\" of being built
successfully.

They also must be environmentally clean and sustainable, and a high
priority for Canada\'s indigenous communities, Carney said.

They can include anything from highways, railways, ports, airports,
pipelines, nuclear projects, clean energy projects and electric
transmission lines.

[Another priority, Carney said, is building infrastructure in the Arctic
to secure the territory and cement Canada\'s sovereignty in the region -
where other nations, including China, Russia and the US, are fighting
for dominance]{.underline}.

Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto, Former Head of

[Canada **isn't really "back"** globally]{.underline}

[When]{.underline} Justin [Trudeau replaced]{.underline} the very
domestically focused Stephen [Harper]{.underline} as Prime Minister in
2015, [many Canadians were proud that "Canada was back" as a dynamic
force in international affairs]{.underline}.

[Reality turned out to be **much less inspiring**]{.underline}. Over the
past four years, [Canada's international efforts were almost exclusively
focused on **"Trump management,"**]{.underline} including the
negotiation of a trade agreement to replace NAFTA.

The government was also successful in finalizing CETA, the free trade
agreement with the EU, initially a project of the previous government.
These negotiations were a real accomplishment.

However, neither the new NAFTA deal nor CETA could be described as
emblems of dynamic Canadian leadership in the world. Moreover, both are
still dangling and, lacking full ratification and/or parliamentary
approval abroad by Canada's partners.

For the rest, [the Canadian government's global presence
has]{.underline} either [been **too fuzzy** to have an
impact]{.underline} (witness, for example, its effort to cast its
foreign aid program as "feminist"). [Or it has been
**embarrassing**]{.underline}, as when Prime Minister Trudeau posed for
photo shoots in India dressed as a Maharajah. [Or]{.underline} it has
been **[inept]{.underline}** as in the failure to sign the CPTPP in
Japan, or the missteps in communication that alienated Saudi Arabia.

But much of Canadian Foreign Policy under Trudeau has been about
symbolism. [The centerpiece]{.underline} of the strategy to place Canada
at the heart of world [affairs has been the campaign for temporary
membership on the UN Security Council. Embarrassingly, that campaign has
**yet to yield results**]{.underline}.

#### Canada agreeing makes them look dependent on the US **Naimpoor '20** --- Sakhi; PhD in the Political Science Department at Western University, Business Executive Member of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation.

However, [for middle powers such as Canada, the construction of foreign
policy is often **overshadowed**]{.underline} by various factors.
[First, the]{.underline} pervasiveness of the [**"bandwagoning effect"**
perversely affects the creation of an **independent** foreign policy.
This means that middle powers often]{.underline} craft and
[**synchronize** their foreign policy **in line** with influential
hegemonic states such as the U.S. to maintain a **united
front**]{.underline} to the various challenges in international affairs.
[By **aligning** and **outsourcing** Canadian foreign policy
prerogatives with]{.underline} hegemonic countries such as [the U.S.,
the political discourse surrounding key issues]{.underline} such as
global terrorism, foreign aid, and peacekeeping [are becoming
increasingly **predictable**]{.underline}.

[Secondly, Canada's]{.underline} geographical [proximity to the
**U.S.**]{.underline} and its membership in NATO [is a **key factor** in
**restricting** the creation of an **independent foreign policy** at
home]{.underline}. President Donald Trump's administration's
unprecedented and unpredictable gambles in foreign policy
endeavours---the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, a policy of
rapprochement towards North Korea, and renegotiation of crucial trade
deals with global powers---places Canada at inconvenient crossroads.
[This begs the following question: is Canada **delegating**
its]{.underline} purported [independence in foreign policy to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates to focus predominantly
on internal political matters?

Since Trump's inauguration in 2016, joint partnerships and policies
surrounding trade, mobility, and continental security have been imposed
and dictated upon Canada---not discussed. On the insistence of the
United States, Canada joined the NATO training mission in Iraq in 2018.
By Trump's directives, Canada reluctantly agreed to renegotiate NAFTA
with the United States and Mexico. While President Trump vociferously
complained about illegal migration into the U.S. from other countries,
Canada quietly processed thousands of unlawful refugees traversing the
United States onto the Canadian side of the border.

While President Trump has openly called Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau "dishonest and weak" and "two-faced" after their encounters at
the G7 Summit in Quebec and the NATO Leaders Summit in London,
respectively, the Canadian government has opted to maintain a policy of
silence in response. Not because we are somehow inherently superior in
culture, tolerance, or attitude, but because the Trudeau government is
afraid to trade diatribes with an unpredictable and impulsive president
who has threatened some of his closest allies with sanctions and
economic pressure in the past.

More importantly, [Canadian foreign policy now **closely resembles**
U.S. foreign policy on]{.underline} many issues ranging from Canada's
diplomatic attitude towards China, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, to
the unsuccessful attempts to grant Juan Guaidó the parallel presidency
of Venezuela. [Considering that Canada is increasingly becoming an
**insignificant player** in world affairs, the bandwagoning and
**dancing along with the political tunes of the Trump administration is
a questionable practice**]{.underline} for the long term that defies our
liberal internationalist values.

According to Randolph Mank, a former diplomat and research fellow at the
Balsillie School of International Affairs, the focal point of Canadian
foreign policy has been "to obtain a seat on the UN Security Council,
though it's unclear what we hope to achieve with it." By exclusively
focusing on the dissemination of some of our values surrounding climate
change, feminist ideology, and multiculturalism, Canada is merely
amplifying its domestic priorities outwards while other pressing
geostrategic issues are flouted.

A wide range of domestic issues in Canada---ranging from the political
perils of a minority Parliament, coupled with the growing power of
separatists in Parliament, Indigenous rights movements, and the
disenfranchisement of Western provinces with federalism---have
overshadowed the foreign policy portfolio. Without doubt, reaching a
mutually agreeable resolution in concert with various domestic political
stakeholders armed with a long list of grievances is an arduous task for
a minority Parliament. At the same time, the Trudeau government's
singular focus on resolving domestic affairs by negligently subjugating
the creation of a comprehensive foreign policy enterprise is not only
irresponsible but also unbecoming for Canada as a liberal democratic
state.

Aside from bandwagoning on to the U.S. foreign policy train, there is an
urgent need for a foreign policy review in Ottawa to clarify and
promulgate our stance on crucial issues, including but not limited to,
active commitment to NATO missions, disarmament, peace negotiations, and
trade. Moving forward, [the **main imperative**]{.underline} for Ottawa
[is to]{.underline} find a balance between strong economic and trade
ties with the US and concurrently be able to [embark upon the initiative
to construct a foreign policy **devoid of dependence**]{.underline} and
one [that places **Canada first**]{.underline}.

#### and the implementation of American Arctic policy creates disintegration amongst allies

**Dauylbayev et al 24 -- Professors in International Relations @
Eurasian National University** (Aidarkhan Dauylbayev\*, Raushan
Yelmurzayeva\*, Takhira Kamaljanova\*, and Gulnara Ibragimova,
02-21-2024, "The ambivalence of the implementation of the US arctic
policy: integrating and disintegration factors of the allies",
Frontiers,
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2024.1341375/full)

However, [there are also various areas of contention among the Allies in
the Arctic]{.underline}. [These factors have the potential to create
divisions or weaken the interests and role of the United States in the
region. These factors include differing priorities and policies among
Arctic allies, competing territorial claims, limited military
capabilities, domestic political factors, economic interests, and
more]{.underline}. [Over the past decade, individual NATO members and
partners with territory or territorial waters in the Arctic, such as
Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the United
States, have been actively advancing their respective national Arctic
interests]{.underline}. 3.9 National interests first Analysis of
official documents and strategies from the US allies revealed
conflicting facts and theses that do not align with collective interests
in the region[. For example, Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy
Framework (Government of Canada, 2019) emphasizes Canada's enduring
sovereignty in the Arctic, the need for a strengthened Canadian military
presence, and bilateral security cooperation without explicit reference
to NAT]{.underline}O. Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
(Government of Canada, 2019) also highlights the intent to seek amicable
resolutions to outstanding border disputes, including the disagreement
with the United States over the status of the Northwest Passage, which
Canada considers "inland waters" while the US regards it as an
international strait through which ships must have unrestricted passage.
The Kingdom of Denmark Strategy for the Arctic (Denmark, Greenland and
the Faroe Islands, 2011) aims to strengthen its status as a global
player in the Arctic by maintaining a visible military presence in the
region. Iceland's 2021 policy on Arctic issues acknowledges Russia's
legitimate interest in ensuring its security FIGURE 2 Factors that
strengthen collective interests and forces. and defense in the changing
Arctic region. Finland's Strategy for Arctic Policy (Publications of the
Finnish Government, 2021) focuses on promoting Arctic cooperation in the
context of Nordic cooperation, bilateral relations with Russia, the US,
and Canada. Notably, the priority order in the Finnish strategy places
Russia ahead of the United States and Canada, indicating foreign policy
priorities for that period. Sweden's strategy for the Arctic region
(Government Offices of Sweden, 2020) underscores the fundamental
importance of upholding freedom of navigation in the Northeast and
Northwest Passages in accordance with international law and resolving
disputes through diplomatic means. [This position on the Northwest
Passage contradicts Canada's national interests and sovereignty, further
contributing to contentious dynamics among the US allies in the
Arctic]{.underline}. 3.10 Territorial disputes The next factor that has
the potential to create divisions among partners is territorial
disputes, which are illustrated on the map (Figure 3). Canada's
submission to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) on May 23, 2019, highlights competing claims
not only from Russia but also from Denmark. As an Arctic state due to
Greenland, the Kingdom of Denmark asserts its claim to an area of
∼895,000 km2 in the Arctic Ocean, a significant portion of which
overlaps with the claims of both Russia and Canada, as previously
mentioned. Denmark has proposed the hypothesis that the Lomonosov Ridge
(Jacobsen, 2016), a 1,070- mile (1,721 km) seamount chain stretching
from Ellesmere Island in Canada's Kikiktaaluk region to Russia's New
Siberian Islands, passing through the North Pole, is a submerged part of
Greenland and thus Danish territory. However, the current dispute
revolves around the question of ownership, with Denmark claiming it as
part of Greenland, Russia asserting it as an extension of the Siberian
archipelago, and Canada maintaining it as an extension of Ellesmere
Island. 3.11 Economic interests---military risks The economic interests
of Arctic allies can sometimes pose strategic risks and threats to
collective security interests. Foreign investments, particularly from
China, in certain countries within the region have reached a level where
they can influence the policies of those countries. This influence is
often achieved by investing in sensitive and strategic sectors. An
example of this is the Chinese investments in mining projects in
Greenland over the past decade. In 2017, the Prime Minister of Greenland
visited China to attract investments, which led to China making a bid
for the airport (Auerswald, 2019). The growing Chinese influence in
Greenland has raised concerns for the United States, as it affects the
US interests in the region. Imposing restrictions on Chinese investments
may only be feasible if Greenland can find alternative sources of
income. Consequently, Greenland's appeal for Chinese Frontiers in
Political Science 07 frontiersin.org Dauylbayev et al.

investors and construction companies to help expand its airports has
prompted Denmark and the US to strategically invest in infrastructure
development on the island (Conley and Wall, 2021). According to Pincus
and Berbrick (2018), this Chinese interest in Greenland presents two
concerns for the United States. Firstly, many of the facilities
attracting Chinese investments have dual-use capabilities, which means
they could potentially be utilized as part of Chinese military
infrastructure in the Arctic, such as refueling stations for warships.
Secondly, due to the small size of Greenland's economy, Chinese
companies can easily hold a substantial portion of the island's economic
activity, providing China with leverage to pursue military and political
interests, including interfering with American presence (Pincus and
Berbrick, 2018). China also has close relations with Iceland. This is
demonstrated by the Icelandic-Chinese Free Trade Agreement signed in
2013 and the establishment of the Arctic Circle Conference, which China
actively participates in. China has a significant diplomatic presence in
Iceland and collaborates on research projects (Olesen and Sorensen,
2019). 3.12 NATO's shared borders with Russia Furthermore, another
factor that cannot be overlooked is the shared state borders of some
Arctic allies with the Russian Federation. The Arctic allies that have a
common border with Russia face specific military risks, which can act as
a divisive factor within the alliance. Proximity to Russian military
installations also creates security concerns that require individual
responses. Finland and Sweden, for instance, remained outside of the
alliance until the onset of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict due to
concerns about potential Russian responses. Additionally, their
membership within NATO complicates defense planning, given that both
countries are within range of various Russian military systems, and
Finland shares a border with Russia spanning ∼1,340 km. The complex
legal status of the Norwegian island of Svalbard also presents a
vulnerability that may attract malicious actors employing hybrid tactics
(Conley and Wall, 2021). For example, the Chinese research station Huang
He is located on the island of Svalbard (Olesen and Sorensen, 2019). The
factorial model of weakening and disintegrating factors is depicted in
Figure 4. It [is important to acknowledge that there are multiple
factors that can cause divisions and weaken the interests and role of
the United States in the Arctic region. These factors encompass varying
priorities and policies among Arctic allies, conflicting territorial
claims, limited military capabilities, domestic political dynamics, and
economic interests. Discrepancies in national strategies and territorial
disputes, such as the disagreement between Canada and the United States
regarding the Northwest Passage, contribute to tensions among the US
allies]{.underline}. Furthermore, the increasing influence of China in
the region, particularly through strategic investments, [raises concerns
about the US interests and collective security]{.underline}. FIGURE 4
Factors that weaken collective interests and forces. The shared borders
between some Arctic allies and Russia introduce specific military risks
and security challenges that necessitate individual responses and
potentially complicate NATO's defense planning. Additionally, the
complex legal status of Svalbard and the presence of foreign research
stations create vulnerabilities and hold strategic importance for
various stakeholders. [These factors underscore the potential
difficulties and obstacles in maintaining unity and collective action
among the US allies in the Arctic.]{.underline}

### AT: Canada Agrees

#### Canada will distance from Trump

[Canada has committed to assert its international leadership to ensure
that the Arctic remains a region characterized by peace, stability and
low tension where states can exercise their sovereign rights and
responsibilities]{.underline}. While strategic competition outside of
the Arctic is likely to continue to complicate relations between Russia
and Canada, it does not preclude Arctic cooperation where this serves
national and regional interests[. Despite ideas expressed by the Trump
administration that the Arctic is a conflict-ridden region, the reality
is quite the opposite. Commentators often draw a false correlation by
conflating Arctic issues emerging in and from the region itself with
grand global strategic issues that may have an Arctic dimension but are
best framed at a global level. Official Canadian policy must take care
to make these distinctions or risk the policy itself contributing to the
very misconceptions that build mistrust and sow the seeds of
conflict.]{.underline} Dialogue and deterrence are compatible activities
in a world of competition and cooperation. Setting up false binaries
does not facilitate a mature, pragmatic approach to international
affairs. Accelerating environmental change and surging international
interest reinforce, rather than undermine, Canada's well-established
circumpolar strategies. Fortunately, the protracted consultation process
leading to Canada's refreshed Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
points to a validation rather than a repudiation of the course laid over
the last three decades. [Aspirations for assuming global Arctic
leadership by co-creating policies led by Canadian Northerners (in
particular, by Indigenous peoples) must be counterbalanced by a
recognition that other states' priorities and interests are not always
synonymous with Canada's. As the global order continues to evolve,
however, Canada must remain attuned to the rising power and influence of
non-state actors who are reshaping international affairs --- and
blurring the boundaries between what is safety, security and defence and
what is trade, investment, development, economic and foreign
policy.]{.underline}

#### And the relationship cant be saved

**Saltman 3-28 -- CNN Reporter** (Max Saltman, 3-28-2025, \"Old
US-Canada relationship is 'over,' warns Canadian prime minister\", CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/americas/canada-trump-tariffs-response-latam-intl)

[Canada will have to "dramatically reduce" its reliance on the United
States as the two countries' relationship darkens, Canadian Prime
Minister Mark Carney warned on Thursday, adding that the old bilateral
relationship was "over."]{.underline}

After holding a cabinet meeting to discuss Canada's response to US
President Donald Trump's tariffs threats, [Carney told reporters in
Ottawa that he foresaw the coming of a "fundamentally different
relationship" between the two countries.]{.underline}

["The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening
integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation
is over,"]{.underline} he said.

["It's clear the US is no longer a reliable partner. It is possible that
with comprehensive negotiations, we could reestablish an element of
confidence but there will be no going backwards]{.underline}," the
Canadian leader said, adding that future governments would have to
grapple with the same changed dynamic.

["There's even more to do, and that's why I chose to go to France and
the United Kingdom, two long-standing and reliable partners, friends and
allies of Canada,"]{.underline} Carney said, referring to his first
international trip as prime minister.

Hours before Carney spoke, Trump wrote on his Truth Social social media
platform that Canada and the European Union would face "large scale
Tariffs, far larger than currently planned," if they work together to
"do economic harm" to the US.

In Ottawa, Carney said that tariffs imposed by Washington, if permanent,
would require "a broad renegotiation of our security and trade
relationship with the United States."

"[We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United
States," Carney continued. "We will need to pivot our trade
relationships elsewhere, and we will need to do things previously
thought impossible at speeds we haven't seen in
generations."]{.underline}

Trump and Carney are expected to speak by phone in the coming days, he
also said, noting that the White House had reached out regarding a call
on Wednesday night. Though he has no plans to visit Washington, Carney
-- who became prime minister less than two weeks ago -- said it is
"possible" members of his cabinet may make the trip.

Canada 'will respond forcefully'

Carney's latest comments follow Trump's declaration on Wednesday of a
25% tariff on all cars and car parts shipped to the US. The move drew
global criticism; Carney deemed it a "direct attack" that violated the
US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

Carney on Thursday promised a strategy of "retaliatory trade actions" to
be unveiled after Trump makes an expected announcement on April 2
regarding the US's next steps.

"This is a negotiation," Carney said, declining to go into specifics.
"It doesn't make sense to tip your hand and say what you're going to do
going forward."

The prime minister noted that his government understands the US tariffs
strategy to be focused on five key sectors --- the automotive industry,
lumber, steel and aluminum, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.

Mike Myers joins Canada PM Mark Carney.

you may think

"We have a number of measures that we can take in response to those
initiatives," Carney continued, adding that it "doesn't make sense" to
respond individually to each measure from the US.

"We're going to know a lot more in a week and we will respond then," he
said.

Carney's wait-and-see approach aligns with that of Mexican President
Claudia Sheinbaum, who told reporters on Thursday morning that Mexico
would also announce its own tariff plans after April 2.

"We will respond forcefully. Nothing is off the table to defend our
workers and our country," Carney said, warning Canadians that "there is
no silver bullet, there is no quick fix" in a trade war.

"[I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us
so that America can own us," Carney also said]{.underline}.

Carney also reiterated his government's ongoing domestic policies to
cushion the blow of expected US tariffs for Canadian workers and
businesses.

"We are masters in our own home," Carney said, a line he often uses in
public remarks, echoing an old slogan in Québec politics.

### Link\-\--Missile Defense

#### Canada hates the expansion of American missile defense

5-29-2025, \"Canadian ambassador likens Trump Golden Dome comments to
'protection racket'\", The Hill,
https://thehill.com/policy/international/5324024-trump-golden-dome-canada-annex/

[Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae on Wednesday compared
President Trump's recent comments about the "Golden Dome" missile
defense program to a "protection racket."]{.underline}

[Trump on Tuesday said he offered Canada free Golden Dome protection if
the northern neighbor agrees to join the U.S. as its 51st
state.]{.underline}

[If Canada does not agree to be annexed --- and chooses instead to
"remain a separate, but unequal, Nation" --- the protection would cost
\$61 billion, Trump said]{.underline}.

"In another context this would called a 'protection racket,'" Rae posted
on X, responding to Trump's comments.

"Both Canada and the United States signed the UN Charter in 1945.
Article 2 of the Charter states clearly 'The Organization is based on
the sovereign equality of all nations,'" Rae wrote in a subsequent post.

"Threats to sovereign integrity also prohibited," he added.

[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has repeatedly stressed his country
would not join the U.S. under any circumstance.]{.underline} His recent
election victory is often attributed to his firm defiance of Trump's
musings about annexing Canada.

"[The prime minister has been clear at every opportunity, including in
his conversations with President Trump, that Canada is an independent,
sovereign nation, and it will remain one]{.underline}," Carney's office
told a Canadian news outlet, in response to Trump's remarks.

Carney's office confirmed last week that there were "active discussions"
between the two countries on existing and new security programs such as
Golden Dome, the BBC reported.

"Canadians gave the prime minister a strong mandate to negotiate a
comprehensive new security and economic relationship with the United
States," Audrey Champoux, a spokesperson for Carney, told the BBC.

[President Donald Trump left out a key detail this week when he outlined
his plans for a massive missile and air defense shield over the
continent: He can't build it without Canada.]{.underline}

[And it's not clear America's northern neighbor wants in.]{.underline}

[Canada would need to play a pivotal role in Trump's signature,
potentially \$500 billion effort to build the so-called Golden Dome,
according to U.S. officials and experts, with Ottawa providing radars
and airspace needed to track incoming missiles in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

[And while Trump insists the country wants to participate, Canadian
leaders appear more tepid.]{.underline}

"There's a lot we just don't know," said Shuvaloy Majumdar, a
Conservative member of Canada's parliament. "There's a lot that needs to
be revealed about how the economic and security partnership with America
and Canada will unfold."

Trump, in his Golden Dome announcement on Tuesday, dismissed what Canada
could offer the project. "They want to have protection also, so as
usual, we help Canada," he said.

Yet whether he realizes it or not, [Trump suddenly finds himself in need
of an ally he has largely forsaken. He has singled out Canada for free
riding on American military might and preferential trade ties, and has
engaged in a tariff battle that has stilted relations. Prime Minister
Mark Carney has warned the United States can't take Ottawa for granted
and has begun searching for other security partners]{.underline}.

#### Missile defense is particularly a concerning issue to Canada

**Charron 19 -- Associate professor and director of the Centre for
Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba** (Andrea
Charron, 2019, "Canada, the United States and Arctic Security" Canada's
Arctic Agenda: Into the Vortex,
https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/documents/Arctic%20Report%202019%20web.pdf#page=101)

Of course, it is the maritime domain that is expected to see
significantly more activity in the Arctic. [While NORAD has a maritime
warning mission, which means NORAD has access to a common Arctic
operating picture from which to identify potential North American
threats, the binational cooperation stops there. Canada is prickly about
the idea of any US government vessels operating in the Northwest Passage
(NWP), and Canada and the United States had been reluctant to heed
Norway's calls for more NATO exercises in the Arctic until 2018, when
they participated in Trident Juncture.]{.underline} To date, NATO
exercises in the North American Arctic have been out of the question.
The functional logic that saw the need for the United States and Canada
to defend North American airspace together, and jointly, does not seem
to apply to the North American maritime approaches. [While the Royal
Canadian and US navies work together very closely and have many formal
and informal bilateral agreements to allow for tactical integration in
most scenarios, the Arctic is a separate scenario --- the navies are
best described as working in parallel in their respective sections of
the North American Arctic.]{.underline} The same is true of the 2 Read
in particular the Northern Lights report by the Special Senate Committee
on the Arctic (Senate of Canada 2019). Coast Guards --- they work
together seamlessly in the Great Lakes and in the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans, [but Canadian sensitivities to assumed sovereignty breaches any
time a foreign vessel (especially an American one) is in the
NWP]{.underline} means that the coast guards are quick to reference the
terms of the 1988 Arctic Cooperation Agreement (Global Affairs Canada
2014) before engaging in activity in the other's Arctic. One could see a
variant of the Shiprider program officially known as Integrated
Cross-Border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations, a program that has US
and Canadian law enforcement officers on board the same ship to patrol
shared maritime borders, such as in the Great Lakes, to arrest drug
smugglers or other violators of Canadian or US law (Royal Canadian
Mounted Police 2016), naturally extend to Canada's Arctic Offshore
Patrol Vessel, a new class of ship to monitor the Beaufort Sea with the
United States, or the Lincoln Sea with the Danes, but [this
collaboration would require Canada to solve its maritime boundary
disputes with both states.]{.underline}

#### Canada especially hates missile defense in the Arctic

**Charron 19 -- Associate professor and director of the Centre for
Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba** (Andrea
Charron, 2019, "Canada, the United States and Arctic Security" Canada's
Arctic Agenda: Into the Vortex,
https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/documents/Arctic%20Report%202019%20web.pdf#page=101)

[The Canada-US defence relationship, however, can be upset, especially
when national interests are misaligned. For example, Canada's refusal to
participate in the United States' ground-based midcourse defence system
(which Canada refers to as "ballistic missile defence") has been a
source of friction, as have recent suggestions by Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo that the United States should pursue freedom of navigation
exercises in the NWP because Canada's claim to it is
"illegitimate]{.underline}" (Pompeo 2019). [In the case of ballistic
missile defence, the United States simply worked around Canada's "no";
NORAD will warn of an incoming ballistic missile, but USNORTHCOM has
sole decision making in terms of defeating the missile with its
intercept system]{.underline}. The United States' room to manoeuvre is
far greater than Canada's, and generally, the United States accommodates
Canadian concerns and challenges or develops its own, unilateral
solution. [The latter case is more problematic because Canada has less
flexibility to compromise on this issue without prejudicing its case.
The United States has always referenced Canada's categorization of the
NWP as illegitimate --- that is not new --- but it has never threatened
the freedom of navigation exercises to underline this difference of
opinion]{.underline}. The limits of "agreeing to disagree" may have just
been found. [As well, responding to this current, mercurial US
administration is fraught with unexpected backlashes that make Canada
reticent to respond as it might wish to do.]{.underline}

[Now that Mark Carney has been chosen as the new leader of the Liberal
party, Canada is likely on the verge of a federal election --- a time
for Canadians to re-evaluate our priorities and vision for Canada. The
impending election comes at a crucial juncture for our country, and
indeed, the entire world.]{.underline}

For the first time since the Cold War, we are once again facing a
divided world --- not between two superpowers, but between two
ideological alliances --- liberal democracy and repressive
authoritarianism. [The latter regimes --- a new "axis of evil" --- are
engaging in an increasingly coordinated assault on the rules-based
international order, seeking to co-opt international institutions and
international law and destabilize liberal democracies.]{.underline}

[To make matters worse, the world's most powerful liberal democracy, the
so-called "leader of the free world," is lurching precipitously towards
repressive authoritarianism]{.underline}. Under President Donald Trump,
who has a clear affinity for autocrats --- if not aspirations to become
one --- [the U.S. is unmistakably descending towards a defection from
the alliance of democracies in favour of the axis of evil.]{.underline}
The Trump administration has upended the rules-based international order
it's long upheld, and fractured the transatlantic alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's ill-fated visit to the White
House at the end of February encapsulated the sharp American foreign
policy reversal. In an appalling public display, Trump and U.S.
Vice-President JD Vance openly parroted Kremlin propaganda, perversely
blaming Zelensky and Ukraine for being invaded by President Vladimir
Putin's Russia. In the week following the meeting, the Trump
administration made concrete its betrayal of Ukraine, freezing military
aid and intelligence assistance.

As aspiring dictators are wont to do, Trump has also increasingly
demonstrated expansionist territorial ambitions. Alongside Greenland and
the Panama Canal, it appears that he has a genuine desire to annex
Canada.

In 1939, Winston Churchill, facing the looming spectre of Nazism,
described the Canada-U.S. border with admiration, noting that it is
"guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations ... an
example to every country." Today, that is no longer the case.

[Against this daunting regional and global backdrop, the importance of
principled and effective Canadian foreign policy is more important than
ever before. We need to redefine Canada's role in the world --- and we
have needed to for some time now. As of last summer, only three per cent
of Canadians believed our international reputation had improved in the
past year --- the lowest on record since tracking began.]{.underline}

It is imperative that all federal political parties embrace a new
foreign policy vision for Canada, one that recognizes and responds to
the unprecedented global challenges of today, and returns Canada to its
roots as a world leader in the protection and promotion of democracy and
human rights.

[More specifically, Canada's new foreign policy must first involve
strengthening our relationships with liberal democratic allies. We must
devote substantially more resources towards deepening economic and
political ties with other democracies, and towards working with our
allies to promote democracy and the rule of law, which is currently
under threat around the world.]{.underline}

This should involve re-earning a seat at the table in our allies'
multilateral partnerships and agreements, deepening bilateral trade and
economic ties, and, at a bare minimum, ceasing to deny arms to our
closest democratic allies. [These actions would be necessary regardless
of Trump's presidency, but have become even more important because of
it.]{.underline}

[Second, Canada needs to wake up to the reality that the world has
entered a new era of conflict between liberal democracies and
authoritarian regimes --- the new axis of evil]{.underline}. This will
require concerted policy action both beyond our borders and here at
home.

Internationally, we must staunchly support the liberal democracies on
the front lines of this new conflict: Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. If the
U.S. is unwilling to lead or even aid that effort, we --- alongside our
allies --- must assume that mantle. We also need to work with our allies
to protect the integrity of international institutions, including the
United Nations and its agencies, and guard against the weaponization of
international law. Furthermore, as the current chair of the G7, Canada
must place the protection of democracy and the combatting of autocracy
at the forefront of the G7's agenda.

At home, Canada needs to begin meeting or exceeding our two per cent
NATO military spending target as soon as possible, as we committed back
in 2014. We must rapidly enhance our military capabilities, with the
awareness that our sovereignty is under serious and credible threat
---not only from the axis of evil, but also from our neighbour who was
once, and hopefully will be soon again, our greatest ally.

In addition, we must take real steps to combat foreign interference,
including through legislative and policy measures to protect Canadians
from the growing threat of transnational repression. Our government
should also dedicate resources towards countering authoritarian
disinformation here in Canada, especially online --- and at the very
least, avoid being influenced by it in policymaking.

[Third, Canada needs to re-assume its role as a global leader in
promoting peace and combatting human rights abuses. This must be driven
by a genuine, principled commitment to building a more just, peaceful
and humanitarian world --- not cynical domestic political agendas, such
as appeasing the demographics of a single riding. Further, it must
involve concrete and meaningful action, rather than performative
virtue-signalling.]{.underline}

Canada's peacebuilding and humanitarian efforts should include policy
responses to Putin's criminal war of aggression in Ukraine; Xi Jinping's
Uyghur genocide; the Islamic Republic of Iran's terrorist proxy network
and mass domestic repression; the denial of Venezuelans' democratic and
other rights; the ongoing genocide by the paramilitary Rapid Support
Forces in Sudan. Finally, Canada should work towards a genuine,
democratic, two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian
Territories.

[It is well past time for Canada to retake a leadership role on the
global stage in promoting democracy, the rule of law, and human rights
and freedoms, and in countering those who threaten them --- whether they
be in Beijing, Moscow, Tehran or Washington, D.C.]{.underline}

#### Now is the key moment for Canada to ascend to global leadership

**Zhang 4-16 - Head of Policy for the Ottawa-based Centre for Canadian
Innovation and Competitiveness, the Canadian affiliate of the

global leader\", Research Money Incorporated,
https://researchmoneyinc.com/article/galvanizing-canadian-ambition-going-from-middle-power-to-global-leader

[Canada has long embraced its identity as a "middle power," respected on
the world stage, yet not mighty enough to wield hegemonic
influence.]{.underline}

As a middle power, we play a role in international peacekeeping
missions, shape global accords, and occasionally earn a mention
(alongside other countries) in The Economist or The Wall Street Journal
for our strengths in industries like AI and agriculture.

[But Canada has the potential to be more than just a supporting player.
With greater ambition and the right vision, we can influence global
markets and become a dominant force.]{.underline}

The Trump administration miscalculated when launching its trade war by
assuming Canada would passively accept annexation through economic
coercion.

[By treating Canada as a "minor power" that might meekly submit to the
pressure, Trump underestimated our self-perception as a middle power --
a status that, when threatened, has fueled national outrage and united
Canadians.]{.underline}

Trump's delusional threats of annexation have inadvertently created an
opportunity to change our national narratives. [Do we remain a middle
power, content with a seat at the corner of the "adult's table," or
aspire to more?]{.underline}

[Canada has the foundation to become an industrial powerhouse. The
global political clout to match will follow, but only if we get
ambitious enough. That said, we are currently failing to capitalize on
our strengths.]{.underline}

Canada is the most educated country in the world, but we lack the anchor
firms needed to keep top talent and R&D from leaving in search of better
opportunities. Rather than incentivizing firms to remain small, we
should focus on helping them scale up, giving talent a reason to stay.

Canada possesses abundant natural resources and critical minerals
necessary to support a world-leading advanced manufacturing sector.
However, we set up bureaucratic roadblocks that stall extraction and
processing instead of developing these assets in-house in close
collaboration with Indigenous communities.

Our points-based immigration system was designed to attract talented
human capital, yet it has largely been used to backfill low-wage
positions. Instead, we should prioritize welcoming researchers and
scientists displaced by the Trump administration's cuts.

With the most coastline access in the world, we should be a shipping
powerhouse. But we have neglected our aging and inefficient
infrastructure, preventing Canadian factories and farms from efficiently
getting goods onto cargo ships to reach international markets.

[Canada's stable institutions and rule of law make it an attractive
destination for foreign investment. However, rather than embracing the
support, we have been reluctant to leverage these advantages, with some
even arguing that Canada should reduce the presence of foreign
multinational companies.]{.underline}

Canada shares an official language with almost half of the countries in
the world. Yet, out of convenience, we have relied too heavily on the
United States rather than diversifying our global influence.

These are all ingredients for success, but simply having them isn't
enough. You can't just leave cake ingredients on the counter and expect
a cake to bake itself. Nor should we settle for store-brand flour when
we have the means to access the best.

For example, while Canada has the highest postsecondary education rate
in the world, we lag in the percentage of STEM degrees awarded, which
holds back our potential in high-tech industries.

Canada is the world's ninth-largest economy, yet we rank just 17th in
productivity. Closing this gap demands decisive action.

If our governments continue to spread support across every industry that
comes knocking, an approach the United States and China can afford to
do, our resources will be stretched too thin. Instead, we must be
strategic and prioritize sectors where Canada has a real shot to compete
on a global scale.

Crossing our fingers and hoping that innovations in the postsecondary
sector make it from lab to market is not a strategy; it's a missed
opportunity. Avoiding the hard conversations about bridging this gap
means leaving money on the table. We must ensure that the research
emerging from Canadian universities translates into real-world economic
gains.

Framing debates on new technologies around precaution, rather than
embracing innovation and understanding technologies before regulating
them, will prevent us from building the lead we need to succeed in
growth industries like AI and genomics.

[We should be pursuing ambitious and aggressive industrial strategies in
key industries, detailing clear plans for tax policy, workforce
training, incentives, regulation and trade.]{.underline}

[The goal must not be merely to survive or preserve the status quo. It
should be to win.]{.underline}

[The time has come for Canadians to shed our comfortable middle power
complacency and build the courage to rise to the occasion. Our
prosperity depends on our ambition. Let's stop leaving our potential on
the table and start building the powerhouse we\'re meant to
be.]{.underline}

#### Canada needs to maintain sovereignty against Trump to sustain their Arctic leadership

**Huebert 2018 -- Fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute** (Rob
Huebert, 11-2018, \"Protecting Canadian Arctic Sovereignty from Donald
Trump\", Canadian Global Affairs Institute,
https://www.cgai.ca/protecting_canadian_arctic_sovereignty_from_donald_trump)

[Canada needs to brace itself for a possible renewed Arctic sovereignty
challenge]{.underline}. Since the mid-1980s Canadians have come to
believe government officials who repeat the mantra that the Canadian
Arctic is ours "lock, stock and barrel" -- as former prime minister
Brian Mulroney liked to put it. [However, the absence of any challenges
since 1985 has not been the result of the Americans or the international
community accepting Canada's claim of sovereignty]{.underline}, but
rather of the special relationship that has been an enduring element of
the Canadian-American partnership. Since the dark days of the Second
World War, Canadian and American relations have been based on an
understanding of shared interests, values and friendships. [That is now
all changing under Donald Trump's presidenc]{.underline}y. This has
already had a serious impact on trade relations between the two
countries and it is clear that all relations are about to get worse. [No
one should expect that those involving the Arctic will somehow avoid
being affected.]{.underline}

Following the 1985 sovereignty "crisis" when the American icebreaker
Polar Sea transited the Northwest Passage without explicit Canadian
permission, successive Canadian governments have told the public that
the sovereignty dispute is over, and that Canadian sovereignty over the
lands and waters of the Arctic has been accepted. However, Canadians
will soon find that this was a pleasant fiction when it comes to the
Arctic waters. The dispute over Canadian Arctic waters appeared to be
solved because Canadian officials were able to come to an understanding
with their American counterparts in 1988 on how to manage the issue.
Both sides pretended that the 1988 Arctic Water Co-operation Agreement
resolved the issue in their respective favours. The [Americans did not
want to set the precedent that accepting full Canadian sovereignty over
the Northwest Passage would mean elsewhere in places such as the Strait
of Hormuz]{.underline}. However, the Americans also did not want to win
an international court challenge regarding the Northwest Passage,
because to do so would mean that countries such as Russia would then
have the clear international right to transit the passage. Canada simply
did not want the Canadian public to think it had lost the right to
control the entry and behaviour of foreign vessels. The reason the two
countries could come to such an understanding was largely due to the
special relationship that has allowed Canadian and American officials to
reach understandings that are impossible between other countries.

[The Trump administration has now made it clear that the benefits of the
special relationship mean nothing to him, and all foreign policies are
to be judged by what they win for the United States. History and shared
values are meaningless in such a calculation]{.underline}. At the same
time, Trump has also made it clear that the construction of strengthened
borders around the United States is one of his most important policy
objectives. While much of his attention has been on building borders to
keep out Mexicans and Muslims, signs are developing that he is also
intent on strengthening the northern borders. This has included putting
up new trade barriers to protect American industries from their Canadian
counterparts. It has also included increasing American enforcement of
borders that include disputed areas with Canada. The recent actions of
American officials in June off the Machias Seal Island, off the coast of
Maine and New Brunswick, show that the Americans are no longer willing
to keep to the existing gentlemen's agreement regarding disputed waters.
[The Americans are now beginning to stop Canadian fishers, looking for
possible illegal immigrants. Until this happened, officials from each
side did not enter the other's zone of dispute. Few other countries
could show such restraint and co-operation and it has largely been
attributed to the special relationship between the two
countries.]{.underline}

[So far, Trump has shown little interest in the Arctic. This has
probably been a good thing for Canada. However, two factors are going to
change thi]{.underline}s. First, his administration is moving forward
with reopening the development of Alaska oil in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). There are no guarantees if or when oil will be
found, but should this happen, there could be an increase in Arctic
shipping to service any such development. Second, despite Trump's
beliefs to the contrary, climate change is occurring and the Arctic ice
is melting. Shipping will be coming on an increasing basis. Maersk
announced this summer that it will send its first container vessel
through the northern sea route later this year on a trial basis. If and
when this new shipping starts to come to the Northwest Passage, will
these vessels ask Canadian permission? To date, all vessels that have
transited the Northwest Passage have done so. But the vast bulk of these
ships have been either tourist or research vessels, which have a special
interest in keeping good relations with Canada.

[Prior to Trump's election, the state department was beginning to
restate its position that it views the Northwest Passage as an
international strait]{.underline}. When the Harper government made the
Arctic shipping reporting system (NORDREG) mandatory, the Americans
issued a diplomatic protest on March 19, 2010 in which they restated
their position that in their view "the Northwest Passage constitutes a
strait used for international navigation." This means that they do not
believe that Canada has the right to unilaterally impose such a
requirement on international shippers and that such action can only be
taken if the International Maritime Organization proposes and adopts it.
In other words, Canada cannot unilaterally assert control over the
passage. American officials have looked the other way when Canadian
officials worked with international shipping companies in transiting the
NWP and were required to seek permission. Given all of Trump's actions
to date, does anyone really believe that he will be willing to continue
to look the other way? If transit shipping for the purposes of servicing
Alaskan oil development or providing goods for American cities were to
begin, does anyone really believe that he will not attempt to assert the
American position?

[So if the United States is no longer willing to support the status quo,
is there anything that Canadian officials can do?]{.underline} Since
Trump has made it clear that co-operation is only possible when the
Americans win, what can Canada do to provide for such a payoff in order
to protect its Arctic sovereignty? The answer is to offer something to
the Americans that they want -- the protection of American borders -- or
in the case of the Arctic, the protection of North American boundaries.
Canada can do this in two ways. First, it needs to ensure that the
Americans understand that commissioning of the new Arctic offshore
patrol ships (AOPS) offers an entirely new North American Arctic
enforcement and surveillance capability. Prior to the arrival of the
Harry de Wolf class there has not been an Arctic-capable naval vessel in
either the Canadian or American navies. It is true that the American
Wind class icebreakers were armed, but these were Coast Guard vessels
and not naval units. Furthermore, the vessels were all decommissioned a
long time ago. Today, neither the USN nor USCG has armed surface vessels
that can operate in any type of ice conditions. Canada will soon have an
ability that the Americans will not. The Americans need to understand
what this means in patrolling the northern borders now.

Canada also now has the opportunity to offer the use of these vessels in
terms of modernizing the NORAD agreement. Both Canada and the U.S.
realize that NORAD needs updating. The Liberal government made this very
clear in its defence policy. As Canada now moves forward to engage the
Americans on this front, Canadian officials have the chance to use
Trump's fixation on securing American borders by integrating the AOPS's
new capabilities into the NORAD system. This is also in keeping with the
2006 NORAD agreement that called for an increased maritime dimension to
the agreement.

[However, Canadian officials need to make it clear that in return for
adding this new capability to the mix, it expects the status quo
regarding the Northwest Passage to be maintained. The United States
would not change its official policy]{.underline}, but would neither
encourage nor support any international shipper that does not wish to
follow Canadian regulations when transiting the passage. Trump does not
understand the special relationship, but he does understand the deal.

[Ultimately, if Trump were to remain unwilling to work with Canada on
this issue, then the AOPS will become even more important. They will
provide Canadian officials with the means of actually stopping any ship
that does not want to ask Canadian permission to enter the Northwest
Passage.]{.underline}

#### Canada has the necessary means and ability to move into a global leadership role -- federal elections supercharge this

**Trends Virtual Office In Canada 4-29 -- Independent research**

for Canada: How Mark Carney's Liberals Plan to Redefine Sovereignty,
Trade, and Global Leadership\", Trends Research and Advisory,

In a rather unexpected turn of events, Mark Carney and the Liberal Party
of Canada made a striking comeback in the 2025 federal elections. The
Conservatives had been ahead in the polls early in the campaign, but a
series of foreign crises and a surge in nationalist sentiment
dramatically changed the game. Economist and former governor of the Bank
of Canada and Bank of England, Mark Carney, seized the moment with a
campaign that promised economic vigor, national sovereignty, and a
renewed international vision. His victory could reshape Canada's
domestic policy and its place in the world.\[1\]

Source: Preliminary results for the federal election, Elections Canada,
April 29, 2025, https://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e.

Carney's Campaign and the Impact of External Events

The 2025 election campaign initially focused on domestic concerns: the
housing affordability crisis, inflation, pressures on the healthcare
system, and climate policy were all top issues. The Conservatives, under
Pierre Poilievre, focused on deregulation, energy development, and
tough-on-crime initiatives. Their platform pledged to eliminate carbon
taxes, loosen environmental restrictions, and streamline energy
projects, which appealed to industries frustrated by years of sluggish
growth. The New Democratic Party, under Jagmeet Singh, continued to
advocate for more public services and wealth redistribution, while the
Green Party pushed for immediate environmental action. The Bloc
Québécois, as always, based its platform on Quebec interests and
sovereignty. The People's Party of Canada, under Maxime Bernier,
advocated a populist agenda but garnered little electoral support.\[2\]

However, the dynamics of the election were transformed by external
events. A series of inflammatory remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump,
topped by his incendiary suggestion that Canada was slipping toward
becoming America's "51st state," and the imposition of a 25% tariff on
Canadian exports, ignited nationalist rage throughout the country. What
had been a low-profile, economically focused campaign was suddenly
turned into a referendum on Canadian sovereignty. Carney, who had
campaigned on pragmatic leadership and international expertise, seized
the opportunity. He positioned himself as the steady, seasoned leader
who could not only defend Canada's interests but also strengthen its
voice globally.\[3\]

Carney's platform was attractive to Canadians increasingly nervous about
the volatility of their southern neighbor. He promised to apply
retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. until equitable trade was resumed and to
diversify Canada's economic partnerships beyond its current reliance on
the American economy. His promise to raise national defense expenditures
to NATO levels while simultaneously spending on affordable housing,
updating healthcare, and offering tax relief to low-income Canadians
presented a comprehensive vision of both domestic and international
renewal.\[4\]

A Shift in Canada's Foreign Relations

Quite possibly, the most notable impact of this election will be felt in
Canada's foreign relationships, starting with its most significant one:
the United States. Canada-U.S. relations are never easy, propelled by
deep economic integration, cultural kinship, and geopolitical interests.
Yet under Trump's second term, the relationship is strained. The Carney
government will probably pursue a firm but pragmatic
course---maintaining retaliatory tariffs to show toughness but quietly
seeking areas of cooperation where interests, such as border security,
counterterrorism, and Arctic sovereignty, still align.

"America wants our land, our resources, our water. These are not idle
threats. Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will
never happen," said Carney in his victory speech.\[5\]

Carney's approach to the United States is the antithesis of the
appeasement policy of past Liberal governments. Instead of attempting to
get along with Washington, Canada is now embarking on strategic
autonomy, with an emphasis on resilience and diversification. This will
probably lead to increased Canadian investment in strategic domestic
industries, the acceleration of energy independence plans, and the
enhancement of relations with other trading partners to reduce exposure
to U.S. economic coercion.\[6\]

Europe, by contrast, offers fertile ground for a Canadian pivot.
Carney's globalist credentials and his commitment to climate action
resonate powerfully with European leaders, particularly in Brussels,
Berlin, and Paris. Canada under Carney will continue to deepen its ties
with the European Union, building on the Comprehensive Economic and
Trade Agreement (CETA) that already governs Canada-EU trade. Green
energy collaboration, techno-governance, and democratic resilience are
all likely pillars of a strengthened transatlantic alliance. Apart from
that, Canada can also find newer pathways in joint defense cooperation
with Europe, especially against the backdrop of growing concerns over
Russian belligerence and American unresponsiveness in NATO.\[7\]

Relations with Russia and China

Relations with Russia are likely to remain frosty under Carney. Canada
has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine, having provided
money, weapons, and diplomatic support since the 2022 Russian invasion.
Carney has signaled that the support is not only set to continue but
will increase. Russia sanctions will likely remain in effect, and Canada
will probably insist on more significant NATO deterrence efforts in
Eastern Europe. However, as an economic alumnus, Carney can also explore
narrow diplomatic channels to stabilize world energy markets and reduce
the volatility that damages Canadian consumers and exporters.\[8\]

On China, Carney's position is less overt. While he knows the threats
posed by China's turn toward authoritarianism and its assertive foreign
policy in the Indo-Pacific, he also knows the engagement imperatives.
The economic prospects of Canada, and especially opportunities such as
critical minerals, clean technology, and agrifood exports, hinge to some
degree on access to markets in Asia. Carney's government can choose what
he has termed a "clear-eyed engagement"---protecting Canadian national
security and human rights interests while mapping trade and investment
relations cautiously. Canadians are adopting a more pragmatic view of
China, accepting economic engagement but fearing strategic dependence,
recent polls show. Carney's challenge will be to balance that tightrope
without alienating foreign allies or domestic stakeholders.\[9\]

Trade diversification will be a cornerstone of Carney's global
policy.\[10\] Beyond Europe and China, Canada will likely deepen ties
with other emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and
Africa. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP) offers an opportunity to boost trade with
fast-growing economies like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore. Meanwhile,
new deals with African nations could open markets for Canadian tech,
education, and green energy industries. This international thrust is
driven by a broader strategic vision: a Canada less dependent on any
single partner and more agile in a volatile world economy.\[11\]

Domestic Policy Impact

Back home, the Carney government's policies will have tangible effects
on the daily lives of Canadians. The promised abolition of the consumer
carbon tax will lessen the cost burden on families, particularly in
suburban and rural areas where the cost of living has skyrocketed.
Meanwhile, investments in low-cost housing aim to address perhaps the
biggest barrier for young Canadians---the inability to buy homes in the
big cities. The Build Canada Homes initiative will spur private sector
development while releasing federal land for construction, a strategy
designed to boost supply swiftly and moderate prices.\[12\]

Tax reductions under Carney's plan, particularly targeted reductions for
low-income families and the elimination of the Goods and Services Tax
(GST) for first-time homeowners, will provide immediate relief for
struggling families. Meanwhile, the suggestion of a "Canada Strong
Pass"---offering free access to national parks, museums, and public
transit vouchers---appears to be an effort to boost national morale and
civic engagement at a time of global uncertainty.\[13\]

Healthcare will also be modernized, with investments in digitization,
recruitment of health workers, and expansion of mental health services.
These initiatives are aimed at strengthening a system worn down by
decades of underinvestment and pandemic pressures, ensuring that
Canadians have timely and equitable access to care.\[14\]

National Security

On the security front, Carney's government will significantly increase
defense spending, prioritizing investments in Arctic sovereignty, cyber
defense, and modernization of the Canadian Armed Forces. Given the
increased strategic competition in the Arctic---particularly from Russia
and China---this investment is both timely and necessary. Canadians can
expect to see new construction projects in the North, which will create
jobs and enhance national unity.\[15\]

Looking forward, the implications of Carney's victory extend beyond the
next four years. His election signals that Canadians are seeking
experienced, stable leadership in an era of global uncertainty. It is a
reassertion of Canada's tradition of multilateralism, democratic values,
and sound economic management---at a time when nationalism and populism
are rising elsewhere.

"We are supporting our friends and neighbors in the crosshairs of
President Trump through a crisis that we did not create. United, we will
build the strongest economy in the G7, an economy that works for
everyone. We will fight back with everything we have to get the best
deal for Canada. We will protect our workers and businesses, and above
all, we will build an independent future for our great country. A future
that makes the greatest country on earth even better. Together, we will
build a Canada worthy of our values. We will build Canada strong, Canada
free, Canada forever."\[16\]

Conclusion

There are, however, still challenges ahead. Managing a deteriorating
relationship with the United States while preserving essential economic
interests will require deft diplomacy. Collaborating with China without
compromising security interests will entail a delicate balancing act.
Making domestic decisions that tangibly impact the quality of life for
Canadians---housing, healthcare, and salaries, first and foremost---will
be critical to maintaining political credibility. The Liberals under
Mark Carney have been given not just a mandate to rule but also to take
Canada in a new direction in a world that is experiencing foundational
transformation. The pledge is that if they succeed, Canada can be
stronger, more resilient, and more influential globally. If they fail,
the forces of disillusionment and polarization will reappear with even
greater intensity.\[17\]

At the moment, optimism is in charge. Most Canadians believe that their
country can defend its sovereignty, rebuild its economy, and make a
positive contribution to world stability. The world will be
watching---and so will Canadians---as Mark Carney's government sets out
to make them right.

Elbows Up and Out

The recent U.S. tariff farce is a sharp reminder that passive economic
leadership leaves Canada dangerously exposed.

An \"Elbows Up\" approach---grounded in assertive domestic
manufacturing, diversified trade, empowered entrepreneurship, and bold
branding---positions Canada for stability and growth regardless of
external turbulence.

Elbows Up leadership is proactive, assertive, and pragmatic. It's about
stepping forward confidently rather than being pushed around quietly.
Canada has all the talent, resources, and innovative capacity it needs.
All it lacks is urgency.

Now's the time for Canada to stop apologizing and start asserting. While
Canada has historically supported the U.S., it may need to reconsider
its actions in the future.

Elbows Up, Canada---your economic future depends on it.

### AT: Not Zero Sum

#### And leadership is zero sum

**Stafford 4-25 -- Retired US Foreign Service Officer** (Edward
Stafford, 04-25-2025, \"The Shattering of US Leadership\", Open Canada,
https://opencanada.org/the-shattering-of-us-leadership/)

President Trump sprinkles many of his discourses on US relations with
other powers in terms of victimhood. [He complains that the US has been
taken advantage of by others, that we have been played for suckers, that
we have rescued nations from oppression, restored prosperity to Europe
and other regions, and gotten no thanks for our many great and decent
deeds.]{.underline} This ahistorical litany of mistreatment is
disconnected from reality in at least two ways: 1. no other nations were
in a position after World War II to take advantage of the United States
-- we set the rules, 2. while some voices in some lands lamented the
rise of American power, most countries and their leaders showed genuine
thanks and appreciation for the US efforts at creating a stable
world-order in which all nations and their people could thrive. As a
Swedish diplomat remarked to me years ago, "We maintain neutrality for
domestic political reasons, but between the US and the Soviet Union, we
are on the US side."

[Trump tends to calculate things as a zero-sum equation -- if we have a
trade deficit with a particular country, they are winning, we are
losing, and they are ripping us off.]{.underline} While some countries
(China in particular) try to suppress labour force wages, exchange
rates, and interests on sovereign debt to gain an unfair advantage for
their exports, most nations, especially those in OECD member states, try
to get advantage for politically influential groups in their country
(rice farmers in Japan for one example) in order to stay in office,
while engaging in give-and-take with trading partners. Truly free trade
between relative peer Liberal Democracies would be better, as it would
contribute to economic prosperity in all the Liberal Democracies, but
political realities influence national trade policies (for example US
agricultural exports). Blinded by his zero-sum lenses, Trump instead
prattles on about eliminating trade imbalances with those nations that
"have been ripping us off for years."

In a recent interview on Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson (highly
recommended), Thomas Sowell commented that if the Trump tariffs were a
negotiating tool of limited duration to reduce tariffs between the US
and its trading partners, then they might not do too much harm. But if
they were long-lasting, he added, they would do real harm to Americans,
especially those in the lower economic quintiles.

[More worrisome for US national security is the corrosive effect Trump's
tariff actions are having on political alliances]{.underline}. While
economists rightly lament the negative financial impact of the
continuing unpredictability of US trade policy, knowledgeable national
security experts, political scientists, and diplomats rightly fear that
Trump's trade policy will undermine our friends and Allies' confidence
in the US fulfilling its treaty obligations or less formal agreements.
The question arises that if Trump will so cavalierly set aside the USMCA
(US, Mexico, Canada) free trade agreement, he might do likewise with the
NATO Treaty or other agreements that, though not a Senate approved
Treaty, have been treated as a binding agreement.

[Running parallel with Trump's zero-sum thinking is his affection for an
'us-versus them' worldview. Usually that 'us' is citizens of the US,
though at times it seems to be only those who support Donald Trump and
are loyal to him]{.underline}. In this way he is much like his second
immediate predecessor who famously spoke of the Senate having only 51
members, that is, the number of Democratic Party members; and,
disparaged all MAGA Republicans as insurrectionists. "Whoever is not
with me is against me..." seems to define loyalty not to principles,
ideals, the US and its Constitution, but to the person of the President.

[On such a foundation of shifting sand, a single personality who is the
temporary leader of the Executive Branch of the US Government, foreign
national leaders will find it impossible to build a lasting
relationship]{.underline}. Worse[, the stable international security
structure may collapse or at least become unsteady as Trump moves the
structure from its current solid foundation of shared principles and
values set by the US decades ago to rest upon perceived loyalty to an
individual personality]{.underline}.

[For Canada, perhaps more than for any other country of the West,
foreign policy and international engagement have long been predicated
upon the strength and reliability of US global leadership. What if the
West can no longer rely confidently on that leadership]{.underline}?
Discussion of the decline of Pax Americana and its potential impact is
not new, but the capacity and willingness of the US to maintain its role
as a global hegemonic leader today is under unprecedented pressure, both
as a result of global transformations and domestic political pressures.
The rise of China as a competing power centre, the emergence of the
global South, and the renewed imperial aspirations of Russia are all
profoundly reshaping the international environment. [Simultaneously, the
US\'s weakening commitment to its leadership role is also changing the
world in fundamental ways. In this context, how can middle powers like
Canada and its allies contribute to fostering global security,
addressing regional security crises, and promoting democratic
institutions and values and a rules-based world market
economy?]{.underline}

In every aspect of its domestic, foreign, economic, and security
policies, Canada\'s fate largely depends on its relations with the US.
Further, its capacity to exert influence on global issues also depends
largely on its relationship with the world\'s foremost power. The same
can be said, in various ways and different degrees, for all other
countries of the West, who must all rethink their own foreign policies
and global engagement strategies in a world where US leadership can no
longer be taken for granted.

[How can US allies navigate a world without American
leadership?]{.underline} This is the question that participants in the
conference that led to this symposium were invited to address from the
point of view of Canada as well as other advanced democracies in Europe
and the Asia-Pacific. [Indeed, like the proverbial canary in a coal
mine, Canada is a good starting point for reflection on the global
impacts of declining or vanishing US leadership. Not only is Canada
itself a part of these two geopolitical axes, but it is also more
directly and more deeply affected by whatever the US does than perhaps
any other country.]{.underline}

The conference on which this symposium is based was convened by the
Canada Program, which is part of Harvard University\'s Weatherhead
Center for International Affairs. The aim of the program is to explore
how the Canadian experience can inform a broader understanding of
international issues. Conference participants were asked to discuss what
the prospects of a world with declining or vanishing US leadership means
for Canada and its allies, how Canada\'s case compares with those of
other countries, and how we can draw lessons from these experiences.

To set the tone of the conference, we asked three senior Canadian
government officials---both active and recently retired---to provide
their perspectives on how countries like Canada can manage to make a
difference as the world undergoes such profound changes.

From his vantage point as a privileged observer of the crisis of
multilateralism, Bob Rae reminds us of this inescapable fact: the world
is in Canada, as Canada is in the world. In the face of mounting global
challenges[, Canadians must take their military obligations more
seriously, while remaining engaged in trade, diplomacy, and development.
Canada cannot withdraw from the world and free-ride under the American
umbrella because, as history has taught us, disengagement and retreat
only serve to create a vacuum that others with darker motives will hurry
to fill. The world needs more, not less, multilateralism]{.underline}.
International institutions must reform to confront global challenges and
cascading crises. Canada can help, but talk is not enough. Action,
commitment, and resources must follow.

For David Morrison, the new international environment is increasingly
governed by power dynamics, which makes it unpredictable and hostile. As
China and Russia assert themselves and the global map tilts to the
South, the world risks becoming more fragmented and less prosperous for
all. To brace for this change, Morrison claims, [Canada has adopted a
pragmatic approach to diplomacy that seeks to work toward common
objectives with all good-faith partners, allies or not. Canada is also
investing resources, not only on defence capabilities but on climate
action and the modernization of Global Affairs Canada. None of this
matters, he concludes, unless Canada gets its relations with the US
right.]{.underline}

Kerry Buck argues that the fraying role of the US in the global
architecture will inevitably make it harder for Canada to navigate
internationally. While Canada\'s foreign policy is more entangled with
the US than that of other allies, in a world where US leadership and
reliability are unpredictable, Canada must develop greater strategic
sovereignty. Calling for a long overdue review of Canadian foreign
policy, she identifies the key questions that must be debated, most of
which relate to the challenges of dealing with a potentially unreliable,
inward-looking, and less globally engaged US.

In the second section of this symposium, three papers address the
challenges of navigating a world without US leadership from the points
of view, respectively, of Canada, Europe, and Asia-Pacific allies. Kim
Richard Nossal opens the discussion by pointing towards the "elephant in
the room": the distinct possibility that Americans might choose to
return Donald Trump to the White House and instate an even more radical
version of his "America First" agenda as the guiding principle of US
foreign policy. [This time, Canadians may not have the option to manage
the day-to-day mood changes of their unpredictable partner while
counting on strong institutional guardrails to keep US foreign policy on
track, as they did during the first Trump mandate.]{.underline} Indeed,
he argues, the "long shadow of America First" may permeate US policy for
quite some time, no matter who manages to win in November.

In that context, is Canada ready for the turbulent years that lie ahead?
According to Thomas Juneau, the answer is a resounding "no." The key
problem, he contends, is not that Canadian foreign policymakers are
unable to assess or understand the momentous changes that are already in
play. The problem is that the country does not have the resources, both
material and human, to put into effect the policies that are urgently
called upon by the emerging international context.

In Europe, the problem of vanishing US leadership takes on an additional
dimension, as Kathryn Stoner notes, as the continent must contend with
the re-emergence of Russia as "an alternative pole of power
intrinsically hostile to liberal democracy." For European democracies,
the challenge of compensating for the weakening US commitment to the
Atlantic alliance is compounded by the rise of conservative nationalist
forces that may facilitate the expansion of Russian influence.

With this increasing pressure from the east, Patrick Holdich writes,
governments and foreign policy establishments across Europe and in the
UK are actively rethinking the nature and extent of their international
engagements. He warns, however, of a possible overreaction to the
current America First moment in US foreign policy. In his view, the
waning of US leadership in the Euro-Atlantic region may come to pass,
but if Europeans themselves respond by turning inwards, the results
would be just as problematic.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the problems of a world without US
leadership come with an extra layer of complexity, as US allies have to
walk on what Yves Tiberghien calls a "dangerous geopolitical tightrope."
Middle powers caught in the increasingly tense and risky global rivalry
between the US and China are taking innovative steps to adjust to an
unprecedented cocktail of disruptive changes. In Tiberghien\'s view,
Canada cannot remain on the sideline; indeed, it has a great deal to
learn from the experiences of its partners who "act as rule-makers or
stabilizers, rather than chaos-takers."

[One of the areas in which Canada can help to fill the void of US global
leadership and make a distinct contribution in sustaining a rules-based
order is trade.]{.underline} As Christina Davis argues, Canada and Japan
are key partners in finding institutional solutions to the challenges of
China\'s economic dominance. Where US leadership cannot be taken for
granted, past experience shows that middle powers can make a difference
if they pursue more moderate, pragmatic goals as building blocks towards
more encompassing institutional solutions.

This symposium only addresses some of the issues that arise from actual
or potential changes in how the US exerts its global leadership role.
[Most importantly, it shows that Canada and its allies have much to
learn as they individually and collectively confront these
change]{.underline}s. Of course, the countries and regions discussed
here are not the only ones that need to find ways to navigate the world
without US leadership. Moreover, from migrations and development to
human rights and climate change, more needs to be understood about how
this emerging international context will put global cooperation to the
test. [To pass that test in a world where the future leadership of the
US is increasingly questioned and contested, and where even its
continuing existence as a stable liberal democracy cannot entirely be
taken for granted, scholars and practitioners of international affairs
must answer the call for innovative ideas.]{.underline}

#### Canadian leadership is key to solve a litany of crisis

[At the same time, the international assistance review needs to be
understood as part of a longer-term process for enhancing Canadians'
engagement on the challenges of global sustainable
development]{.underline}. The issues at stake are of such importance and
complexity that we need a sustained and society-wide approach to
addressing them. Four issues stand out in particular. Global outcomes
are a matter of vital national interests and values. [Canadians have
long supported action on poverty, hunger and oppression]{.underline}.
Now we also need to focus on how global sustainable development affects
our national security, prosperity and quality of life. For example,
increasingly our safety depends on reliable health care systems, access
to food, and government accountability in far-off countries. [Sustained
and inclusive economic growth in emerging economies leads to shifts in
the global marketplace that have an impact on Canada. Our physical
well-being --- our fisheries, our farms, our clean and air and water ---
increasingly depends upon climate action and environmental
sustainability, both here and abroad. Canada's success in tackling
global sustainable development cuts across stakeholders, disciplines and
ministries]{.underline}. The boundaries between domestic and
international issues have become blurred -- the foremost challenges are
now universal. Actions abroad affect our decisions at home. Increasingly
the major issues each society faces affect all societies, even if the
local forms of each problem are different. [Whether they are priorities
like economic inequality, gender equality, marginalized populations,
health and well-being, quality education, water quality or sustainable
infrastructure, each country's strategy will be connected to other
countries' strategies]{.underline}. Public finance remains crucial,
including international assistance, but private investment and other
financing instruments are also essential. It [is estimated that the
universal SDG challenges will require US\$5-7 trillion additional
investment per year, with the largest share required for sustainable
infrastructure in projects for low-carbon energy and transportation.
Much of this will need to be mobilized through private finance,
including banks, pension funds, insurance companies and other major
institutional investors. Aligning such "sustainable finance" channels
with the SDGs will require coordinated action by policy-makers, market
regulators, financial managers and companies. Success in Canada hinges
on proactive leadership by academia, business, civil society,
philanthropy and all levels of government. The global challenges are too
complex to be addressed by any single actor]{.underline}. They require
insights, entrepreneurialism and partnerships --- among scientists,
companies, Indigenous communities and public leaders and others ---
people from all walks of life. However, our businesses are inadequately
engaged on the frontiers of the global economy; our applied research and
think tank systems are weak; civil society's ability to lead and
innovate has been stymied by outdated policies and debates; and our
philanthropic sector is not providing enough risk capital to support
innovation. [And while there are many examples of individual Canadians
making significant contributions, too often they are operating in
splendid isolation. Each actor's knowledge and resources can be made
vastly more effective when leveraged alongside those of
others.]{.underline} Toward a pan-Canadian action plan on Agenda 2030
Taken together, these dynamic issues underscore the importance of a
pan-Canadian approach to implementing the SDGs at home and globally.
What would the building blocks look like? [First, the Canadian
government could build on its recent successes and develop a first ever,
whole-of-government strategy for advancing Agenda 2030 and global
sustainable development. T]{.underline}his would require a concerted
emphasis on policy coherence --- broadening the aperture to look beyond
aid and consider multiple policy domains, such as trade, finance, health
and the environment. The OECD has provided guidance on how to build
cross-government coherence and undertake integrated approaches to SDG
implementation. Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have taken policy
coherence seriously and, as a result, are rated the best in the class.
However, the idea has never gained much traction in Canada. The
amalgamated department of Global Affairs Canada is a starting point for
an integrated government-wide approach. Global Affairs could partner
with the Privy Council Office to develop a strategy that considers
relevant domestic and international issues all across Canada. [Second, a
thriving network of Canadian efforts in this domain will be essential
for tackling the opportunities and challenges ahead --- a network in
which the various stakeholders are motivated, engaged, and interact to
tackle the emerging economic, social and environmental
challenges.]{.underline} The Canadian Network for Maternal, Newborn and
Child Health provides lessons for how connectivity and capacity can be
built across researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and the private
sector. It exemplifies how pan-Canadian approaches can maximize impact
and bolster global leadership. Third, a pan-Canadian sustainable
development implementation strategy is needed to apply the 17
sustainable development goals across our vast country's communities and
jurisdictions. In Alberta, a group of leading business, government and
civil society actors is already working to see how the SDGs can become a
common framework for measuring economic, social and environmental
progress across the province. Germany has already presented impressive
early steps on how a complex federal structure can craft a national SDG
implementation plan. For Canada, a strategy could be conceived of as an
open-source exercise, with provinces, communities, universities,
businesses and organizations of all types developing implementation
plans in a collaborative, public manner. To be sure, care is required to
ensure such an undertaking does not become a pro-forma exercise to meet
reporting obligations to the United Nations or a grinding
intergovernmental exercise. Government as "systems architect" [To bring
such building blocks to life, the Canadian government needs to see
itself as a "systems architect" that is responsible for facilitating an
overall societal approach to implementing the SDGs. This would entail
coordinating open, strategic debates around potential solutions,
bringing knowledge and know-how to bear, and creating the conditions in
which nongovernmental actors and networks could thrive.]{.underline} At
a practical level, this would require a focus on the six "Cs" for
success: Communications: public leaders need to discuss the stake
Canadians have in global sustainable development, articulating national
priorities and engaging in open dialogue. [Capacity: over the long run,
much of the nation's success in navigating complex societal challenges
will hinge on fostering world-class expertise on a range of global
sustainable development issues, within the government and across Canada.
This will in turn stimulate rigorous, evidence-based debate across the
country, enhance collaboration with partners from multiple sectors, and
position Canada as an agenda-setter on the global stage.]{.underline}
Convening: the government can help pull together Canadians from across
the country and around the world to facilitate problem solving and help
to identify how diverse actors can collaborate on practical solutions.
Connectivity: the public goods of fostering, sharing, and jointly
developing knowledge can be stimulated across Canada's diverse
ecosystem. Conditions: the public sector has special responsibilities to
establish the enabling conditions for other actors to mobilize, partner
and innovate. For example, regulatory, legal and administrative
constraints inhibit Canadian charities and foundations from going global
and limit civil society and private companies' incentives for joint
ventures. Catalysts: The best ideas and policy decisions will ultimately
need to be backed --- even jump-started --- by adequate and targeted
resources. As indicated above, private resources will be essential, but
public investments will be crucial for the problems that market forces
cannot solve on their own.

#### Governmental regulations prevent AGI - extinction

**Bengio 23 -- Professor of computer science at the Université de
Montréal, founder and scientific director of Mila--Quebec Artificial
Intelligence Institute, and senior fellow and codirector of the Learning
in Machines and Brains program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced
Research** (Yoshua Bengio, 9-2023, \"AI and Catastrophic Risk\", Journal
of Democracy,
https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/ai-and-catastrophic-risk/

How should we think about the advent of formidable and even superhuman
artificial intelligence (AI) systems? [Should we embrace them for their
potential to enhance and improve our lives or fear them for their
potential to disempower and possibly even drive humanity to
extinction]{.underline}? In 2023, these once-marginal questions captured
the attention of media, governments, and everyday citizens after OpenAI
released ChatGPT and then GPT-4, stirring a whirlwind of controversy and
leading the Future of Life Institute to publish an open letter in March.
[That letter, which I cosigned along with numerous experts in the field
of AI, called for a temporary halt in the development of even more
potent AI systems to allow more time for scrutinizing the risks that
they could pose to democracy and humanity, and to establish regulatory
measures for ensuring the safe development and deployment of such
systems.]{.underline} Two months later, Geoffrey Hinton and I, who
together with Yann Le Cun won the 2018 Turing Award for our seminal
contributions to deep learning, joined CEOs of AI labs, top scientists,
and many others to endorse a succinct declaration: "[Mitigating the risk
of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other
societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."]{.underline} Le
Cun, who works for Meta, publicly disagreed with these statements.

This disagreement reflects a spectrum of views among AI researchers
about the potential dangers of advanced AI. What should we make of the
diverging opinions? At a minimum, they signal great uncertainty. Given
the high stakes, this is reason enough for ramping up research to better
understand the possible risks. And while experts and stakeholders often
talk about these risks in terms of trajectories, probabilities, and the
potential impact on society, we must also consider some of the
underlying motivations at play, such as the commercial interests of
industry and the psychological challenge for researchers like myself of
accepting that their research, historically seen by many as positive for
humankind, might actually cause severe social harm.

[There are serious risks that could come from the construction of
increasingly powerful AI systems]{.underline}. And progress is speeding
up, in part because developing these transformative technologies is
lucrative---a veritable gold rush that could amount to quadrillions of
dollars (see the calculation in Stuart Russell's book on pp. 98--99).
Since deep learning transitioned from a purely academic endeavor to one
that also has strong commercial interests about a decade ago, questions
have arisen about the ethics and societal implications of AI---in
particular, who develops it, for whom and for what purposes, and with
what potential consequences? These concerns led to the development in
2017 of the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of AI
and the drafting of the Asilomar AI Principles, both of which I was
involved with, followed by many more, including the OECD AI Principles
(2019) and the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial
Intelligence (2021).

Modern AI systems are trained to perform tasks in a way that is
consistent with observed data. Because those data will often reflect
social biases, these systems themselves may discriminate against already
marginalized or disempowered groups. The awareness of such issues has
created subfields of research (for example, AI fairness and AI ethics)
as well as the development of machine-learning methods to mitigate such
problems. But these issues are far from being resolved as there is
little representation of discriminated-against groups among the AI
researchers and tech companies developing AI systems and currently no
regulatory framework to better protect human rights. Another concern
that is highly relevant to democracy is the serious possibility that, in
the absence of regulation, power and wealth will concentrate in the
hands of a few individuals, companies, and countries due to the growing
power of AI tools. Such concentration could come at the expense of
workers, consumers, market efficiency, and global safety, and would
involve the use of personal data that people freely hand over on the
internet without necessarily understanding the implications of doing so.
In the extreme, a few individuals controlling superhuman AIs would
accrue a level of power never before seen in human history, a blatant
contradiction with the very principle of democracy and a major threat to
it.

The development of and broad access to very large language models such
as ChatGPT have raised serious concerns among researchers and society as
a whole about the possible social impacts of AI. The question of whether
and how AI systems can be controlled, that is, guaranteed to act as
intended, has been asked for many years, yet there is still no
satisfactory answer---although the AI safety-research community is
currently studying proposals.

Misalignment and Categories of Harm

[To understand the dangers associated with AI systems, especially the
more powerful ones, it is useful to first explain the concept of
misalignment]{.underline}. If Party A relies on Party B to achieve an
objective, can Party A concisely express its expectations of Party B?
Unfortunately, the answer is generally "no," given the manifold
circumstances in which Party A might want to dictate Party B's behavior.
This situation has been well studied in both economics, in contract
theory, where Parties A and B could be corporations, and in the field of
AI, where Party A represents a human and Party B, an AI system. If Party
B is highly competent, it might fulfill Party A's instructions, adhering
strictly to "the letter of the law," contract, or instructions, but
still leave Party A unsatisfied by violating "the spirit of the law" or
finding a loophole in the contract. This disparity between Party A's
intention and what Party B is optimizing is referred to as a
misalignment.

One way to categorize AI-driven harms is by considering
intentionality---whether human operators are intentionally or
unintentionally causing harm with AI---and the kind of misalignment
involved: 1[) AI used intentionally as a powerful and destructive
tool---for instance, to exploit markets, generate massive frauds,
influence elections through social media, design cyberattacks, or launch
bioweapons---illustrating a misalignment between the malicious human
operator and society; 2) AI used unintentionally as a harmful tool---for
instance, systems that discriminate against women or people of color or
systems that inadvertently generate political
polarization---demonstrating a misalignment between the human operator
and the AI; and 3) loss of control of an AI system---typically when it
is given or develops a strong self-preservation goal, possibly creating
an existential threat to humanity---which can happen intentionally or
not, and illustrates a misalignment between the AI and both the human
operator and society. Here, I focus primarily on the first and third
categories, particularly on scenarios in which a powerful and dangerous
AI attempts to execute harmful goals, irrespective of whether the
outcomes are intended by humans.]{.underline} I refer to such AIs as
"rogue AIs" and will discuss potential strategies for humanity to defend
itself against this possibility.

Protecting Humanity from Rogue AIs

The concern about the possibility of autonomous rogue AIs in coming
years or decades is hotly debated---take, for example, two contrasting
views recently published in the Economist. [Even though there is no
current consensus on the most extreme risks, such as the possibility of
human extinction, the absence of clear evidence against such risks
(including those short of extinction) suggests that caution and further
study are absolutely required.]{.underline}

Specifically, [we should be researching countermeasures against rogue
AIs. The motivation for such research arises from two considerations:
First, while comprehensive and well-enforced regulation could
considerably reduce the risks associated with the emergence of rogue
AIs, it is unlikely to offer foolproof protection]{.underline}. Certain
jurisdictions may lack the necessary regulation or have weaker rules in
place. Individuals or organizations, such as for-profit corporations or
military bodies, may skimp on safety due to competing objectives, such
as commercial or military competition, which may or may not align well
with the public interest. [Malicious actors, such as terrorist
organizations or organized crime groups, may intentionally disregard
safety guidelines, while others may unintentionally fail to follow them
due to negligence. Finally, regulation itself is bound to be imperfect
or implemented too late, as we still lack clarity on the best methods to
evaluate and mitigate the catastrophic risks posed by AI.]{.underline}

The second consideration behind the push for researching countermeasures
is that the stakes are so high. [Even if we manage to significantly
reduce the probability of a rogue AI emerging, the tiniest probability
of a major catastrophe---such as a nuclear war, the launch of highly
potent bioweapons, or human extinction---is still unacceptable. Beyond
regulation, humanity needs a Plan B.]{.underline}

[Democracy and human rights. In the context of the possible emergence of
rogue AIs, there are three reasons why we should focus specifically on
the preservation, and ideally enhancement, of democracy and human
rights]{.underline}: While democracy and human rights are intrinsically
important, they are also fragile, as evidenced repeatedly throughout
history, including cases of democratic states transitioning into
authoritarian ones. It is crucial that we remember the essence of
democracy---that everyone has a voice---and that this involves the
decentralization of power and a system of checks and balances to ensure
that decisions reflect and balance the views of diverse citizens and
communities. Powerful tools, especially AI, could easily be leveraged by
governments to strengthen their hold on power, for instance, through
multifaceted surveillance methods such as cameras and online discourse
monitoring, as well as control mechanisms such as AI-driven policing and
military weapons. Naturally, a decline in democratic principles
correlates with a deterioration of human rights. [Furthermore, a
superhuman AI could give unprecedented power to those who control it,
whether individuals, corporations, or governments, threatening democracy
and geopolitical stability.]{.underline}

Highly centralized authoritarian regimes are unlikely to make wise and
safe decisions due to the absence of the checks and balances inherent in
democracies. While dictators might act more swiftly, their firm
conviction in their own interpretations and beliefs could lead them to
make bad decisions with an unwarranted level of confidence. This
behavior is similar to that of machine-learning systems trained by
maximum likelihood: They consider only one interpretation of reality
when there could be multiple possibilities. Democratic decisionmaking,
in contrast, resembles a rational Bayesian decisionmaking process, where
all plausible interpretations are considered, weighed, and combined to
reach a decision, and is thus similar to machine-learning systems
trained using Bayes's theorem.

Furthermore, an authoritarian regime is likely to focus primarily on
preserving or enhancing its own power instead of thoughtfully
anticipating potential harms and risks to its population and humanity at
large. These two factors---unreliable decisionmaking and a misalignment
with humanity's well-being---render authoritarian regimes more likely to
make unsafe decisions regarding powerful AI systems, thereby increasing
the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes when using these systems.

It is worth noting that, with only a few corporations developing
frontier AI systems, some proposals for regulating AI could be
detrimental to democracy by allowing increasing concentration of power,
for example with licensing requirements and restrictions on the
open-source distribution of very powerful AI systems. If, to minimize
catastrophic outcomes by limiting access, only a few labs are allowed to
tinker with the most dangerous AI systems, the individuals or entities
that control those labs may wield dangerously excessive power. That
could pose a threat to democracy, the efficiency of markets, and
geopolitical stability. The mission and governance of such labs are thus
crucial elements of the proposal presented here, to make sure that they
work for the common good and the preservation and enhancement of
democracy.

[Safe, defensive AIs to counter rogue AIs.]{.underline} How might
humanity defend itself against rogue AIs that surpass human intelligence
in many critical ways? Let us imagine armies of AI "trolls" on social
media. Individual trolls could learn from the online presence of the
people they are aiming to influence and engage in dialogue with those
targets to sway their political opinions or entice them to take certain
actions. Alternatively, consider cyberattacks involving millions of
computer viruses, coordinated in a manner impossible for a human team to
devise. Such sophisticated attacks would exceed our usual
cybersecurity-defense capabilities, which have been designed to counter
human-driven attacks.

[And there is rapidly growing concern that bioweapons could be developed
with the assistance of question-answering AI systems]{.underline} (as
per Dario Amodei's congressional testimony), or even constructed
directly by more autonomous AI systems in the future. What types of
policies and cybersecurity defenses could be established to avert or
counteract such dangers? When confronted with an enemy smarter than
humans, it seems logical to employ assistance that also surpasses human
intelligence.

Such an approach would require careful implementation, however, as we do
not want these AI assistants to transform into rogue AIs, either
intentionally because an operator takes unwarranted control of the AI or
because the operators lose control of it. It is important to note that
we currently lack the knowledge to construct AI systems that are
guaranteed to be safe---that is, systems that will not unintentionally
become misaligned and adopt goals that conflict with our own.
Unfortunately, even slight misalignment can result in the emergence of
unintended goals, such as power-seeking and self-preservation, which can
be advantageous for accomplishing virtually any other goal. For
instance, if an AI acquires a self-preservation goal, it will resist
attempts to shut it down, creating immediate conflict and potentially
leading to a loss of control if we fail to deactivate it. From that
point on, it would be akin to having created a new species, one that is
potentially smarter than humans. An AI's self-preservation objective
could compel it to replicate itself across various computers, similar to
a computer virus, and to seek necessary resources for its preservation,
such as electrical power. It is conceivable that this rogue AI might
even attempt to control or eliminate humans to ensure its survival,
especially if it can command robots. It is therefore critical that we
conduct research into methods that can reduce the possibility of
misalignment and prevent loss of control. Spurred by scientific
breakthroughs and the anticipated benefits of more powerful AI systems,
both the scientific community and industry are making rapid progress
developing more powerful AI systems---making research on countermeasures
a matter of urgency. The risk of dangerous power concentration (either
at the command of a human or not) escalates with the expanding abilities
of these systems. As they inch closer to surpassing human capabilities,
the potential for significant harm grows.

[In Canada]{.underline}, [significant **cybersecurity clusters are in

its innovation and expertise. In 2017, IBM partnered with the University
of New Brunswick to launch the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.
Subsequent investments from IBM created hundreds of cybersecurity jobs
in the province. NB-based startup, Beauceron Security launched in 2015
inside the University of New Brunswick when local IT experts transformed
a personal project into an innovative, web-based cyber risk technology
that had higher education institutions across the country and the City
of Fredericton among its impressive list of early adopters. In Ontario,
the province has united its impressive cybersecurity clusters in growing
hubs like Toronto, Waterloo, and Ottawa with similar centres of
excellence like Ryerson University's Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst in
Brampton. [The federal government]{.underline} is starting to take
notice too. In its recently tabled 2022 federal Budget, the government
**[pledged \$875.2 million]{.underline}** [in funding for the
Communications Security Establishment]{.underline} over five years "[to
**address**]{.underline} [the rapidly evolving **cyber threat
landscape**]{.underline}." In February, it committed \$80 million to
Canada's National Cybersecurity Consortium -- a not-for-profit
organization that brings together the cybersecurity expertise of five
universities from across Canada. That's a great start -- but more needs
to be done. In addition to funding, [our governments must ensure the
conditions are in place for active **collaboration**]{.underline}
between regional technology entrepreneurs across cybersecurity,
artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to keep our innovation and
talent domestic. At the same time, businesses and academia must work to
collaborate and develop centres of excellence such as the ones in New
Brunswick and Ontario to ensure that both the private-sector
investments, research and talent pipelines necessary to grow the
industries are in place. [If Canada wants to pursue **dominance in
cybersecurity**]{.underline}, [this will mean **exporting our
cybersecurity expertise** to **allies** and leveraging our trade
partnerships to further bolster sector demand]{.underline}. I

hungry for access to cybersecurity talent and regional collaboration to
enable inclusive growth for their businesses -- of all sizes -- in the
digital economy. We are working to help create the conditions for Canada
to show economic and governance leadership in cybersecurity, exporting
cutting edge technology while influencing global regulatory norms.

[The]{.underline} first and possibly [most dangerous path to escalation

[cyberweapons]{.underline} [in a great power crisis to paralyze the
vital command, control, and communications capabilities of an adversary,
many of which serve nuclear and conventional forces]{.underline}. In the
"fog of war" that would naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
recipient of such an attack might]{.underline} [fear]{.underline} more
punishing follow-up kinetic attacks, possibly [including the use of
nuclear weapons, and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal, launch its
weapons immediately]{.underline}. [This might occur]{.underline}, for
example, [in a confrontation between NATO and Russian forces in east and
central Europe or between U.S. and Chinese forces in the Asia-Pacific
region]{.underline}. Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for
example, James N. Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "[both
sides would have overwhelming incentives to go early with offensive
cyber and counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities or advantages]{.underline}." If these early attacks
succeeded, "it could result in huge military and coercive advantage for
the attacker." This might induce the recipient of such attacks to back
down, affording its rival a major victory at very low cost.
Alternatively, however, [the recipient might view the
attacks]{.underline} on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure [as the prelude]{.underline} to a
full-scale attack aimed at neutralizing its nuclear capabilities [and
choose to strike first]{.underline}. "It is worth considering," Miller

the now-31 NATO members. The budget does nothing to change this.

[Canada as a world leader is more a conceit than a reality---in our last
two tries, we were turned down for a seat on the UN Security
Council.]{.underline} Other countries didn't see an overwhelming case
for us to be on the Security Council. [While Canada does play a useful
role in world affairs, in many different ways, these do not constitute
\"leadership]{.underline}.\" Other countries like us, and find us a
useful partner. The U.S. finds us especially useful right now as a
poodle-like cheerleader for its dangerous zero-sum effort to unite the
world against China and impede its development.

[But there's little evidence that the world looks to Canada for new
ideas and leadership for a safer, sustainable, prosperous, and equitable
plane]{.underline}t. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, though, sees
Canada as \"a diplomatic powerhouse,\" less a source of ideas and
actions, but a country good at \"convening and making sure diplomacy is
happening.\" Even so, in launching our Indo-Pacific Strategy, she
declared that \"the goal was not just to engage, but to lead.\" To lead?

As a NATO member, Canada has been committed since 2006, and reaffirmed
in 2014. Clearly we won't. Canada currently spends about 1.27 per cent,
according to NATO. But the federal budget for 2023 fails to set us on a
path to meet this commitment, with the defence budget barely mentioned.
\"One could argue that another measure should be used, but this is the
one agreed upon by the heads of government of all members in 2014 and
repeatedly reconfirmed by them at every meeting since then,\" retired
Col. Charles Davies points out in a pre-budget publication by the CDA
Institute. \"It bothers me that Canada has consistently failed to make
any meaningful effort to meet the commitment made by prime minister
Stephen Harper and repeated several times by Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau. How do you belong to a club and not carry your agreed fair
share of the load?"

This, as Davies argues, \"is not a good place for Canada to be.\" And
our own failure to act, especially in North American defence, means that
the U.S. could someday take matters into its own hands, acting in
Canadian airspace and the Arctic, and simply ignoring Canadian
sovereignty if it feels unprotected. The parliamentary budget officer
estimated last year that Canada's forward projections on defence
spending still mean we will be \$15.1-billion below target in 2026-27,
even if defence spending rises from \$36.3-billion in 2022-23 to
\$51-billion in 2026-27, as fiscal projections suggest. \"It is a sad
thing for a country of our capacity, and the stature we want to have in
the world, to be welching on our commitments,\" Davies contends.

[Our policy on China, or more accurately, our lack of a clearly
enunciated policy on China, is another example of failure. Our
Indo-Pacific Strategy---and there can be no Indo-Pacific strategy
without engaging with China---appears to reject any effort to engage
with China.]{.underline}

"We will challenge China when we ought to, and we will cooperate with
China when we must," it says, leaving little room for anything else. In
fact, it seems to discourage business from dealing with China. \"China
right now poses a geopolitical risk, and the business community needs to
know it,\" Joly says. None of this amounts to forward-looking China
strategy, leaving Canada behind as other countries recognize China is
too big to be contained and too important to be isolated or ignored.

Europe is a good example. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the
European Commission, before departing with French President Emmanuel
Macron for a mission to China last week, set out in a carefully-worded
speech to define Europe's strategy towards China and what success should
look like. She minced no words about Europe's disagreements with China.
But \"our relationship with China is far too important to put at risk by
failing to clearly set the terms of a healthy engagement.\" It was vital
the international system itself be strengthened, she said, and that
cannot be done without China. \"This is why it is vitally important that
we ensure diplomatic stability and open communications with China. I
believe it is neither viable---nor in Europe's interest---to decouple
from China. Our relations are not black or white---and our response
cannot be either.\"

While on her visit with Macron to Beijing, von der Leyen said Europe
would not be shy about rising "deeply concerning issues.\" But it was
also vital to \"leave space for a discussion on a more ambitious
partnership and how we can make competition fairer and more disciplined.
And more broadly, we need to think about how we can work together
proactively in the global system in the future, and on which
challenges.\" So Europe does not want to cut economic, societal,
political or scientific ties.

Contrast this with Joly's tone, which seems openly hostile to a
re-engagement with China and intended mainly to please the U.S. It may
be that our foreign policy is set in Washington, not Ottawa, these days.

[For all the boasting of Canada as a leader on the world stage, while we
are a supportive player, there is scant evidence that we really are the
major player we see in our self-image. What we should do is define where
we can be most useful---and deliver.]{.underline}

#### Theres no link -- American Arctic policy doesn't prevent Canada from becoming a global leader -- leadership isnt a zero-sum game

#### The G7 Conference hurt Canada's bid for leadership

**AP 6-15 -- Newswire Service** (The Associated Press, 6-15-2025, \"G7
leaders gather in Canada for a summit overshadowed by Israel-Iran
crisis\",
https://www.npr.org/2025/06/16/nx-s1-5434828/g7-canada-israel-iran-trump-trade-wars)

KANANASKIS, Alberta --- [Leaders of some of the world\'s biggest
economic powers arrived in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday for a Group of
Seven summit, overshadowed by an escalating conflict]{.underline}
between Israel and Iran and U.S. President Donald Trump\'s unresolved
trade war.

Israel and Iran trade more deadly strikes in third day of escalating
conflict

[Israel\'s strikes on Iran and Tehran\'s retaliation, which appeared to
catch many world leaders unawares, is the latest sign of a more volatile
world.]{.underline}

Trump in recent days vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran\'s Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a U.S. official told The Associated
Press, in an indication of how far Israel was prepared to go.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had discussed efforts to
de-escalate the crisis with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders and said he expected \"intense
discussions\" would continue at the summit.

Trump is summit\'s wild card

[As summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to
abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint statement, or communique,
at the end of the meeting.]{.underline}

[With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him
out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral
conversations rather than a show of unity.]{.underline}

Trump is the summit wild card. He arrived at the international summit
sporting a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. He was greeted by four
Mounties. [Looming over the meeting are his inflammatory threats to make
Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland.]{.underline} French
President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland on Sunday for a highly
symbolic stop on his way to Canada. Macron warned that Greenland is
\"not to be sold\" nor \"to be taken.\"

\"Everybody in France, the European Union thinks that Greenland is not
to be sold, not to be taken,\" he said during a news conference,
applauded by the local crowd.

\"The situation in Greenland is clearly a wakeup call for all Europeans.
Let me tell you very directly that you\'re not alone,\" Macron added.

Trump\'s plane landed in Alberta late Sunday. He will have a bilateral
meeting with Carney on Monday morning before the summit program begins.

\'He tends to be a bully\'

Leaders who are not part of the G7 but have been invited to the summit
by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South
Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs
will continue to be top of mind.

Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he
left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \"We have our trade deals.
All we have to do is send a letter: \'This is what you\'re going to have
to pay.\' But I think we\'ll have a few, few new trade deals.\"

[Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump
has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South
Africa.]{.underline}

Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien told a panel this week that
if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like
Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.

\"He tends to be a bully,\" Chrétien said. \"If Trump has decided to
make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it
and keep talking normally.\"

Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal
that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It
has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are
not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.

[Starmer\'s attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position
with Canada, the U.K.\'s former colony, close ally and fellow
Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism --- especially
from Canadians --- for failing to address Trump\'s stated desire to make
Canada the 51st state.]{.underline}

Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told
The Associated Press: \"I\'m not going to get into the precise
conversations I\'ve had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an
independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the
Commonwealth.\"

#### Canada structurally can never be a global leader

**Lowman 24 - *Hub\'s Managing Editor*** *(*Harrison Lowman, 03-04-2024,
\"Harrison Lowman: When the going gets tough on the world stage, Canada
gets going\", The Hub,
https://thehub.ca/2024/03/02/harrison-lowman-when-the-going-gets-tough-on-the-world-stage-canada-gets-going/)

In 2015, newly minted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared Canada was
finally "back" on the world stage. [But many argue that in the last
decade, Canada's international voice has only continued to weaken, and
today is little more than a whisper. We do not wield the same authority
or command the same respect as we did generations ago.]{.underline}

After countless trips abroad, Matthew Fisher, Canada's longest-serving
foreign correspondent admitted, "There is no country in the world that
does less and says more than Canada." Was he on to something, or
exaggerating? What's happened? Who's to blame? And what's a
multilateral-minded middle power to do?

This past Tuesday, The Hub's Managing Editor Harrison Lowman was invited
to speak at Toronto's Royal Canadian Military Institute on the subject
of Canada's waning international influence.

Below is an excerpt from his speech, entitled, "Has Canada Lost Its
Place on the World Stage?"

Hub readers can watch the entire speech, along with its lively QandA
here:

On August 15, 2021, Taliban fighters stunned the world, streaming into
Kabul, Afghanistan like a swarm of locusts. They spread through the city
on dusty pick-up trucks, stormed into government buildings, past streets
NATO forces had died defending. They occupied the capital at lightning
speed. Barely a shot was fired.

In mere hours, Kabul was draped with their black flags. They had
returned to power 20 years after being banished.

A humanitarian who worked in women's health care in the country was
texting me from inside a bunker. I asked if she was okay. She told me,
"I am safe. Afghans are not...It's insane."

An Afghan journalist who grew up in Kabul and who had been covering the
war for two decades was gathering his family to flee. He told me he had
just witnessed "the massacre of \[his\] dreams." He told me he and his
children ran for their lives.

Western ambassadors had been preparing for this day, but they could not
have imagined it would come so soon. They were scrambling. The British
ambassador Sir Laurie Bristow sounded like he was going down with the
ship:

"We'll put everything we can on this for the next few days, trying to
get out everyone who we need to get to safety as soon as we can," he
assured those listening. He would go on to evacuate thousands.

The Americans stayed. The French ambassador stayed too. France sent
commandos to gather French nationals and Afghan families and get them to
military planes.

The Ukrainians, who were on the verge of their own invasion, chartered a
bus, which drove through live firefights to get their people, along with
Afghans who had helped Canada, out of harm's way.

[Where was Canada?]{.underline}

[Gone. Missing in action. We were reportedly one of, if not the first
major embassy to evacuate.]{.underline}

Within no time, long-bearded guerilla fighters were happily traipsing
through our abandoned embassy. Past piles of empty wine bottles, and our
painting of an Afghan girl learning to read, beneath a red maple leaf.
It was a bad look for our supposed feminist foreign policy.

Where was the Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan, Reid Sirrs?

He had apparently boarded a half-empty RCAF military plane and taken off
to safety...one of only two Canadian military aircraft to flee the city.

If Mr. Sirrs had looked down as he left Kabul airspace, he may have been
able to make out the more than 1,000 Canadian citizens and interpreters
who helped our armed forces during our 13-year mission.

"We all saw on TV, it was two planes after ours that the people were
hanging off the airplane when people fell off it," said Sirrs later on,
reported by Blacklock's Reporter. "So, it was quite close for us."

For us. Mr. Sirrs?

Thousands of terrified people were stranded. What notice did our
citizens and allies get who had been left behind? It turns out that all
they initially received were text messages from Immigration, Refugees
and Citizenship Canada. They were instructed---in English only---to
travel on their own with no escorts (our soldiers, military advisors,
and diplomats were gone, you see) and sneak past Taliban fighters,
through a churning, muddy and bloody sea of desperate civilians, to the
airport. They were later told that, if they made it to the airport
gates, they should be wearing something red and shout out "Canada" and
hope a soldier heard them. [In the coming weeks, it would become clear
that it was really up to Canadian veterans to volunteer to get
translators and their families out of the country. Not our
government.]{.underline}

[This was a complete abdication of duty.]{.underline} We betrayed these
people. And we should be ashamed of our country.

Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan Reid Sirrs would be quietly
reassigned to a posting in Argentina. He and his staff would be honoured
with a ceremony and a \$10,000 plaque that now sits outside Global
Affairs Canada. It commemorates what our federal government claims was
our amazing evacuation of Afghans and embassy staff. Astonishingly, it
reads, "This plaque pays tribute to all the government of Canada
employees who contributed to this heroic effort." Sirrs' LinkedIn
profile currently reads that he has skills when it comes to "managing
during times of crisis."

[In Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 12, 2022, 12 whole days before Russian troops
fired a shot, Canada would again be one of the first to
leave]{.underline}. [We allegedly hold the title of being the only G7
country to immediately suspend our diplomatic presence in Kyiv at the
tim]{.underline}e. It then took almost 90 days for us to then only
partially re-open Canada's embassy.

In Israel, this past October, as Hamas terrorists burst into Israeli
kibbutzim slaughtering men, women and children, Canadian citizens on the
ground who attempted to contact the Canadian embassy there were met by a
voicemail advising them the embassy was closed for the Thanksgiving long
weekend. As reported by Matt Gurney, they were initially directed to an
emergency hotline...in Ottawa.

[It seems when the going gets tough, Canada gets going.]{.underline}

An international reputation running on fumes

All of these examples are symptoms of a disease this country has been
suffering from for decades. And believe me, we are sick and in need of a
cure.

[It is now 2024. And we are still relying on the Pearsonian reputation
of Canada built in the 1960s.]{.underline}

[Can you guess how many Canadians we currently have taking part in UN
peacekeeping operations? The present government, which insisted in 2015
that Canada "is back," would have you believe there are hundreds of
Canadian blue berets currently stationed across the globe.]{.underline}

[The real answer is 57.]{.underline} In 1992 it was 3,285.

[In 2024, Canada's reputation is running on fumes. And the world it was
built on? That world no longer exists. No matter how much we pretend it
still exists. It doesn't.]{.underline}

"Free riders." "Not pulling its weight." "Risk-averse." "Unreliable."
"Not fit for purpose."

These are the words we increasingly see attached to our country's name;
whispered in the corners of international conferences.

Not only that, you now hear that we are, "Preachy" or "Act like we are
morally superior."

Former Liberal deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister John
Manley recently had this to say:

["We seem to have decided that we would rather carry a soapbox with us
and get up on it and tell people how they need to do things differently,
rather than finding ways to insinuate ourselves into these many complex
and difficult situations..."]{.underline}

[You have all heard the expression, walk softly and carry a big stick.
Canadian academic Denis Stairs says Canadian foreign policy is more akin
to "speak loudly and carry a bent twig."]{.underline}

[Before he passed, Matthew Fisher, Canada's longest-serving foreign
affairs correspondent used to tell me, "There is no country in the world
that does less and says more than Canada."]{.underline}

It all begs the question: on the world stage, are we a serious country,
or not a serious country?

A frayed rules-based international order

In an interview with the Toronto Star last month, Prime Minister Trudeau
stressed that one of his biggest priorities was "standing up for the
international rules-based order."

A few weeks later Donald Trump, possibly the next U.S. president,
spouted off at a rally, quoting an unnamed world leader who asked him
about NATO spending and collective defence saying, "Well sir, if we
don't pay, and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?".

What did Trump say his response to this world leader was?:

"You didn't pay? You're delinquent? No, I would not protect you. In
fact, I would encourage them \[Russia\] to do whatever the hell they
want. You gotta pay."

Today, the rules-based international order that has sustained us for 75
years is on life support. It is hanging on a thread. And it cannot be
wished back into being.

"The foundations of the world order are being shaken to their core,"
admitted U.K. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps at the beginning of this
year.

[In its place we see authoritarian leaders emerging, and the
multilateral institutions (the UN, WTO..etc) where Canada's soft voice
was once amplified becoming increasingly irrelevant.]{.underline}

[As Ben Rowswell, a convener at the Network for Democratic Solidarity,
and a former Canadian ambassador and diplomat recently told me, these
organizations are now not much more than "paper exercises]{.underline}."

Meanwhile, strong illiberal authoritarian leaders of powerful countries
(Russia, China, Iran) have formed their old boys' clubs of bullies on a
parallel plane, outside multilateral institutions. And they don't care
about the rules.

Putin has started a European war. China is building artificial islands
in the contested South China Sea and eyeing Taiwan. Iran is fomenting
unrest across the Middle East.

It's "a knife fight," says Rowswell.

"The world has suddenly become stranger, more dangerous, more
complicated, and we're beginning to feel those reverberations in Canada
to a much greater extent," David Mulroney, Canada's former ambassador to
China told me recently. "But the government has simply not responded to
that."

[It has now come to the point where even our traditional allies are
overlooking us as they assemble alliances. The world no longer
immediately says, "We want more Canada."]{.underline}

A neglected Canadian military

[Canada's armed forces are neglected, ill-equipped, and fed
up.]{.underline}

["We are an irrelevant military force]{.underline}," summarized retired
Lieut. Gen. Mike Day, a former Canadian special forces commander and
chief strategic planner for the Canadian Armed Forces.

Other former high-ranking members of the forces are furiously writing
opinion editorials claiming our military is on the brink of collapse.

Meanwhile, almost without precedent, we are seeing soldiers who are
still actively serving, taking risks by voicing their major concerns
publicly.

Vice-Admiral Angus Topshee, commander of the Royal Canadian Navy,
published a video on YouTube explaining the dire state of our navy. He
said his team "faces some very serious challenges" that could mean they
"fail to meet" their commitments. [He bemoaned the fact that only one of
the Canadian Navy's new offshore patrol vessels could be deployed at a
time because of staff shortages.]{.underline}

Vice-Admiral Bob Auchterlonie, commander of the Canadian Joint
Operations Command, also publicly expressed how soldiers are
increasingly being relied on to respond to Canadian natural disasters
which are not in their job descriptions.

The current defence minister is working off a mandate letter penned
three years ago. There was supposed to be what's referred to as a
"defence update" (which names the military's long-term goals and the
equipment needed) delivered in fall 2022. But it's AWOL and still hasn't
happened. We haven't had an update since 2017. Consider for a moment how
much the world has changed since 2017.

We are arming men and women, who we are sending into harm's way, with
obsolete equipment.

"Their equipment has been relegated to sort of broken equipment parked
by the fence," says former chief of defence staff Rick Hillier. "Our
fighting ships are on limitations to the speed that they can sail or the
waves that they can sail in...And so, I feel sorry for the men and women
who are serving there right now."

Last year, I reported on some of Canada's most egregious military
equipment mishaps. A selection of what I found:

Our soldiers have been using WW2-era Browning 9mm handguns as their
standard-issue sidearm. We have been trying to replace them for more
than a decade.

We only retired the 114-year-old Lee Enfield rifle from frontline
service a few years ago. We were the last national military in the world
to do so. We were using a version of this rifle in the Boer War!

Canada's Victoria-class submarines were already second-hand when we
purchased them in the 1990s. They have been breaking down and barely
making it out to sea ever since. And we apparently need to use them into
the 2030s.

The notorious Sea King helicopters were flying for 55 years before they
were replaced.

The process of replacing our ancient fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft
took 12 years. They're approaching 40 years old. The grandfathers of the
people flying our fighter jets could have flown the same planes. My own
grandfather, a journalist covering the forces, flew in the first one
delivered to Canada. We are now apparently going to re-equip Canadian
squadrons with the F-35. Who knows when?

Others disagree with all this. They assure me our military is not on the
verge of collapse. That we should take the advice of retired generals
calling for billions more in spending with a big grain of salt, as they
are often working as consultants for defence companies. These critics
will also tell you that calls for much more defence spending (which they
often say comes at the expense of social services) are really just
fear-mongering.

["It's a bottomless pit. There's never enough money for the defence
establishment," Peggy Mason, president of the Rideau Institute on
International Affairs and a former Canadian ambassador for disarmament
to the UN, told me. "And yet DND cannot even spend all the money it gets
now---to the tune of \$1-2 billion per year."]{.underline}

"The Department of National Defence will always say it needs more money.
And there's a lot of hype that accompanies that," veteran Ottawa Citizen
defence reporter David Pugliese added.

NATO spending

[Our current NATO contributions sit at about 1.38 percent of our GDP, a
far cry from our two percent promise. Ignoring that, Prime Minister
Trudeau reportedly privately told NATO officials Canada would never hit
our spending target.]{.underline}

Rowswell characterized the prime minister's admission as an example of
his "utter incompetence on international security matters."

We would need to spend around 30-40 percent more to reach the two
percent commitment and then figure out a way for DND to even be able to
absorb and allocate what would be a whopping \$20 billion.

[We currently rank 25th out of 30 NATO members when it comes to defence
spending. But we're around the sixth largest spender in terms of
absolute dollars.]{.underline}

[All this, and DND has apparently been told to cut \$1 billion in
funding by 2026.]{.underline}

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says if he wins office his
government would "work toward" increasing military spending to two
percent of our GDP.

He says he'll do it by slashing "back-office bureaucracy," stopping
corruption in procurement, and cutting foreign aid.

But, our contributions to official development assistance (aid to
developing countries) have "collapsed" already says Rowswell. Under this
government it's reached historically low levels.

And no government seems to be immune from ballooning procurement costs.

#### Reject laundry list impacts -- they don't specify anything real

#### Their only warrant to solving extinction is multilat -- there isnt an impact

The potential for shaping multilateralism. It is often assumed that if
[international cooperation]{.underline} were sufficiently broad, it
would be possible to develop options on a global scale that would be
analogous to those available to the nation state within its own
territory, as the term "global governance" suggests. Science and
technology and the organisational resources of governments and non-state
actors can and should indeed provide the necessary problem-solving
potential. This could be mobilized effectively if the (theoretically
extensive) problem-solving capacities of the nation state were
effectively coordinated through international cooperation. In practice,
however, the state's monopoly on the use of force [and its]{.underline}
(ideal or typical) extensive [possibilities to shape
politics]{.underline} within its own borders [are often far **less
comprehensive** and far less **powerful** than is assumed]{.underline}.
These empirical deficiencies in statehood can -- to a degree -- be
compensated by new forms of interaction between state and non-state
actors and international organizations. Overall, however, [the
problem-solving capacity of **multilateralism seems quite
uncertain**]{.underline}. Its potential for realising effective world
governance will depend considerably on favourable conditions.

Multilateral diplomacy: advantages and problems

The strengths and weaknesses of multilateral diplomacy in dealing with
global challenges seem obvious. Multilateral diplomacy not only offers
better opportunities for dealing with complex tasks, it is also better
able to legitimise the results achieved and thus tends to make them more
sustainable, since they emerge from joint efforts. This is particularly
true if the participation is con­sidered representative, i.e. if all
important interests and positions were represented.

So "together we are strong". Yes -- but strength can show itself as
stubborn persistence, but also as flexibility, adaptability and
assertiveness. What kind of strength is required depends on the context.
Multilateral negotiations tend to broaden their agenda in order to take
better account of the different objectives and interests of the parties
involved. This makes it difficult to set clear priorities.
[Multilateralism is]{.underline} more [**protracted** and
**costly**]{.underline} than bilateral agree­ments or a unilateral
oktroi. While [the results of multilateral agreements]{.underline} are
generally broad and weighty, [they may not be very effective in
responding to the problem at hand because they are **characterised by
compromises and lowest common denominators**]{.underline}. In principle,
there is an inversely proportional relationship between legitimacy and
effectiveness, which usually requires trade-offs. More [legitimacy may
have to be bought at the price of reduced effectiveness, more
effectiveness at the price of reduced legitimacy.]{.underline} The same
applies to the temporal dimension: [negotiation outcomes that reflect
broad-based multilateral participation may take longer, but]{.underline}
they will probably [last longer and thus be more
sustainable.]{.underline} Conversely, [urgent problems requiring rapid
action can be **better tackled by a small number of
actors**]{.underline} who are willing and [able to move
forward.]{.underline} Multilateral diplomacy is indispensable when
fundamental issues of international governance have to be resolved. [In
acute crises and in specific problem contexts,]{.underline} on the other
hand, [the **disadvantages** of multilateralism are more
significant.]{.underline}

[Other inherent difficulties]{.underline} with multilateralism [are the
well-known **problems of collective action**.]{.underline} [These
include]{.underline} situations resembling [the]{.underline} classic
game theory [prisoner's dilemma]{.underline}, in which the best solution
to a conflict for all involved cannot be realized due to the absence of
trust. Another problem is free riding and its weaker variant, in which
the commitment to participate in collective action is half-hearted:
after all, others are already taking care of the problem, so one's own
efforts can be reduced if not stopped (which would be full free riding).
In the worst case scenario, [multilateralism can **nurture illusions**
-- such as the illusion that the world is making progress on military
disarmament because multinational negotiations are dealing with
it]{.underline}. In some cases, [this has been the situation for
decades]{.underline}, as [with the Geneva Conference on Disarmament,
which has not produced]{.underline} any significant
[results]{.underline} for over twenty years.

#### Canadian cooperation over ballistic missile defense builds their leadership and it doesn't look like their losing their sovereignty because America burdens the costs

[Both the Canadian and U.S. governments have demonstrated their
commitment to ensuring the national security of not just their homeland,
but also that of their closest North American ally. These commitments
have manifested themselves in some of the most successful defense
agreements in U.S. history.]{.underline} Instead of continuing a Cold
War--era strategy of mutual vulnerability, the U.S. and Canada should
promote policies that ensure their security and strengthen their posture
vis-à-vis new unpredictable actors, such as Iran or North Korea, in an
increasingly dangerous world. The U.S. should move toward a "protect and
defend" strategy,39 a policy "based on shifting away from the
retaliation-based strategic posture of the Cold War toward a more
defensive posture that is adapted to the emerging international
structure."40 This posture encompasses offensive and defensive weapons,
both nuclear and conventional. It also includes civil defense measures
to ensure that the civilians increase their chances of survival in the
case of a successful attack. States such as Iran and North Korea value
the survival of their own [leaders above those of their cities and
economic centers, while the U.S. and Canada prioritize the opposite.
Ballistic missile defense is an essential element of moving toward a
more appropriate posture that would effectively address current national
security challenges. Canadian participation in U.S. missile defense
would benefit not only U.S. interests; it would also go a long way in
serving Canadian interests.]{.underline} The U.S. and Canada both
endorse NATO's missile defense programs for the protection of European
allies. NATO adopted missile defense as a core competency of the
Alliance in 2010 in its Strategic Concept.41 [Most important,
participation in U.S. long-range ballistic missile defense would provide
Canada with the means to defend its citizens and homeland from a
potentially devastating ballistic missile attack. Rogue states know that
Canada and the U.S. have a special relationship.]{.underline} These
enemies may take the opportunity to exploit that friendship by attacking
Canada. They could restrain U.S. freedom of action by holding its
neighbor to the north hostage. Indeed, a successful ballistic missile
attack would have serious repercussions for both countries as their
economies are interconnected. Cooperation between the two nations could
take many forms[. For example, Canada contributes to the U.S.
Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, which protects the U.S. from
North Korean and Iranian ballistic missiles]{.underline}.42 General
Charles H. Jacoby Jr., Commander of North American Aerospace Defense
Command, told a Canadian and American audience: "I believe we're at the
point where we must take seriously the North Korean threat to our
homelands. This is no longer a relatively primitive threat, but rather
they are progressing towards troubling new capabilities.... As such, the
threat validates the past and future U.S. investments in developing
credible missile defenses against such potential threats."43 [Canada
could contribute financial resources or territory to U.S. missile
defense efforts. Canadian endorsement of U.S. missile defense efforts
would show leadership to other U.S. allies seeking to improve their
ballistic missile defense capabilities]{.underline}. "Currently, Poland
and Romania agreed to host Aegis Ashore missile defense sites. Turkey
hosts an Army/Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance (AN/ TPY-2)
forward-deployed radar. Spain is currently hosting U.S. Aegis
missile-defense-capable ships. The Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark are
considering upgrading their ships for a missile defense role. The Dutch
navy is modifying ship radars to track ballistic missile targets. Spain,
Norway, and the United Kingdom have also expressed interest in ship
upgrades. Denmark and the United Kingdom host Upgraded Early Warning
Radars."44 The military and intelligence worlds have warned of the
threat of long-range ballistic missiles to the Canadian and U.S.
homelands.45 [And politicians of both countries should endorse
cooperation on a missile defense system]{.underline}. As former Canadian
Defense Minister John McCallum stated, "It is the fundamental
responsibility of the Canadian government to ensure the maximum
protection of the lives of its citizens."46 [Missile defense would
provide Canada with an effective system to protect its citizens from one
of most effective threats to the modern way of life---ballistic missiles
with nuclear warheads. Canada already endorses missile defense for NATO
allies in Europe, so Canadian participation in U.S. missile defense
would be a natural extension of the current policy.]{.underline}
Canadian positive endorsement of U.S. missile defense efforts would send
a message to adversaries that Canada considers protecting its citizens
from a ballistic missile threat a priority. NATO members have begun
contributing to the U.S. missile defense system. Currently, "21 nations
are directly participating in this networked system of systems. Yet
Canada is not one of them."47 The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Germany,
and Romania have all made contributions.48 Canada has signed off on NATO
missile defense programs; and, therefore, "Canada now officially
endorses the logic, strategic utility and security benefits of ballistic
missile defense."49 [Cooperation on missile defense is a mutually
beneficial arrangement. Both European and Asian nations have received
U.S. protection in exchange for hosting U.S. missile systems.50 In
return for its endorsement of U.S. missile defense, Canada might seek a
voice in U.S. missile defense decisions regarding incoming missiles
headed for Canada. For example, the Canadian government could ensure
that Canadian cities are at the top of "the priority list for missile
interceptions.]{.underline}"51 [Currently, Canada would not have a voice
regarding what happens to an incoming missile headed for Canada.
Currently, Canada can "can issue warnings of an impending attack on the
continent but cannot participate in decisions regarding interception,"
even when a missile is heading straight toward Canada.52 This leaves the
hundred or so Canadian personnel at the Colorado Springs missile defense
site with the option of doing nothing in the event of a missile attack
on the United States or Canada.53]{.underline} The undeniable
interconnectedness of U.S. and Canadian national securities necessitates
cooperation. [Over decades, such cooperation has resulted in "a wide
range of bilateral arrangements," which encompasses "joint planning and
operations, combined exercises, defence production, logistics,
communications, research and development, and intelligence
sharing."]{.underline}54 There is also an issue of delegation of
authority regarding intercepts of incoming missiles. Proper command and
control procedures must be in place before a ballistic missile is
launched, as there will be precious little time to discuss such vital
issues when a missile is en route toward its victims. A long-range
ballistic missile takes about 33 minutes to reach its target, which
means that commanders have literally minutes to decide what to do about
an incoming missile. Any delays can lower the chance of
interception---or deny the U.S. an opportunity to fire a second
interceptor should the first one miss. [Missile defense cooperation
could allow governments to pool resources and share financial
burdens.]{.underline} Even relatively small contributions can make a
substantive difference for all NATO members. Similarly, U.S. and
Canadian missile defense cooperation could help relieve some of the
associated costs of the program for both parties. [Since the U.S.
already has a significant missile defense system in place, Canada would
not be burdened with research and development costs, which present a
significant investment upfront. Retired Canadian Lieutenant-General and
former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of NORAD George Macdonald pointed out
the moral and substantive "free rider" critiques against the Canadian
government: "Morally, Canada has purportedly given up its sovereign
responsibility to defend itself against ballistic missiles, while
substantively, it is argued that Canada will now be dependent upon the
US to provide that defence at US discretion and on US
terms."]{.underline} 55 Adversaries may take advantage of Canada's
current vulnerability to a ballistic missile attack. At the moment, Iran
and North Korea can most likely reach the U.S. and Canada with a
ballistic missile. Additionally, Iran can reach Canadian
forward-deployed troops. These nations continue to tenaciously pursue
ballistic missile technology. Regardless of the financial or
international consequences, they have shown that they will continue
their pursuit of these weapons. Currently, ballistic missile defense "is
among the only defensive options available to reinforce the West's
commitment, resolve, and capability to protect key allies against
nuclear blackmail."56 Missile defense not only protects a nation and its
allies from a direct attack, but also from the manipulation of rogue
nations.

#### Lack of US recognition of Canadian [sovereignty]{.underline} over the [Northwest passage]{.underline} drives a [wedge]{.underline} between the alliance. The plan's [accession]{.underline} to UNCLOS is a key [concession]{.underline} to [revive]{.underline} relations.

Diplomatic. Cooperation to further U.S. interests in the Arctic was put
forth as a policy as early as 1971 with NSDM-144.224 In December 2022,
the Department of State announced the establishment of an
"Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region" to collaborate with
stakeholders towards the advancement of U.S. policy.225 However, the
State Department has not published an Arctic Strategy, a missing
component to serve National Arctic strategy and complement defense
strategies as part of the all instruments approach. Such a strategy
would clarify what the Arctic Ambassador intends to do, establish
priority diplomatic issues of focus for the Department of State, and
provide broad government wide guidance for participation in bi-or
multi-lateral Arctic engagements like defense cooperations, the Arctic
Coast Guard Forum, and Arctic Council. [Without a **diplomatic
strategy**, the U.S.'s national Arctic strategy's call for a whole of
government approach is left with a **gaping void**]{.underline}.

[The U.S. faces a **conundrum** in purporting to **defend** and
**support** an international order of rules and laws supported by
**cooperation** through global partnerships and like-minded allies while
at the same time in **dispute** with its **closest** geographic
**ally**]{.underline}, **[Canada]{.underline}**, [over those rules and
laws covering **EEZs** and **FoN**]{.underline}. [While the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has not **ratified** the
**UNCLOS**, Canada has]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} the [UNCLOS
**Section 8**]{.underline}, **[Article 234]{.underline}**: Ice-covered
areas226, [Canada claims certain **archipelagic** waterways within its
**EEZ** as **internal** waterways subject to enforcement of **sovereign
regulation**]{.underline}. 227 [The U.S. **opposes** this interpretation
as an **excessive restriction** of its sovereignty]{.underline}, [in
favor of **unrestricted freedom** of navigation]{.underline}, with
practical (albeit covert) consequence for submarine transits. 228
Additionally, [through the]{.underline} Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (**[CLCS]{.underline}**) [under the
**UNCLOS**]{.underline}, [Canada claims rights to the **seabed** and
**subsurface** **rights** in far extension of its
**EEZ**]{.underline}.229 [The CLCS]{.underline}, [however, only has
authority to **delineate** the **outer boundaries**,]{.underline} [not
to delimit **overlapping claims**]{.underline}, [which is a matter for
independent **inter-state negotiations**]{.underline}.230

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Canada make
**overlapping** maritime **claims**]{.underline} in the Beaufort Sea,
[ostensibly due to **different techniques** to establish the
**baselines**]{.underline} ("a notional, adjusted coastline") [from
which their maritime boundary claims are projected]{.underline}.231 See
Figure 13 for an illustration of the area of overlapping claims (AOC),
over 7000 square nautical miles of disputed waters with open oil and gas
lease blocks. While the United States Department of Interior Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, responsible for managing offshore oil and gas
leases, defines lease blocks within the AOC and beyond the U.S. EEZ,
none have been issued.232 Meanwhile, Canada has issued 5 lease blocks
that fall wholly or partly within the AOC.233

[The issue of freedom of navigation also presents **intractable
conundrums**]{.underline} for U.S. policy makers. Canada and Russia both
make, in the view of the United States, excessive claims to specially
regulate maritime traffic through their Arctic near-shore waters. [In
principle of maintaining **untarnished freedom** of the seas, the U.S.
**adamantly** **opposes** such claims while at the same time **raising
alarm** about **China** exercising presence in the Arctic which is
defended by Chinese diplomats through freedom of navigation
principles.]{.underline} [The United States should **cede** to a
**Canadian**]{.underline} and Russian [**premise** that ice breaking
escorts near shore ice-covered routes would be of **mutual
interest**]{.underline} for environmental protection, crises mitigation,
and risk reduction thereby enabling safe economic activity.

[It would be in the U.S. interest to support Canada's regulation of its
**archipelagic** waterways as **internal** under the UNCLOS ice
provision before it **melts** and regular usage leads to an
"**international waterway**" definition]{.underline}.234 Developed under
international institutional authority, [such a **concession** of
**sovereignty** to do so may **bolster** those institution's
**relevance** in line with U.S. grand strategic interests **without**
practically **limiting** **freedom** of seas anywhere else]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} additionally [**strengthen** the
Canadian-U.S.]{.underline} [alliance]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline} an
interpretation [is **uniquely applicable** to the **Northwest**
passage]{.underline}, therefore [**without consequence** for freedom of
navigation in **other theaters**]{.underline} - [the **Northeast**
passage is less ice covered]{.underline}, [already **heavily
trafficked**]{.underline}, [and **not archipelagic**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thus [such an interpretation would not be a
**concession** nor **applicable** to Russian regulation]{.underline} of
its near-coastal Arctic waters. [As Canadian defense and security is
**heavily dependent** upon **cooperation** with the United
States]{.underline}, [it is likely Canadian sovereign regulation of the
waterway would **support** U.S. security **interests**]{.underline}, in
part [by **limiting** legal access of **adversaries**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} otherwise by [legalizing **stringent regulation** in
difficult to navigate areas]{.underline}.

[**Even if** the concession lent **credence** to Russia's
regulation]{.underline} of its near-coastal waters and thus be
antithetical to countering Russian transgressions, [that would
simultaneously **limit** China's free access to the region, thereby
imposing **stress** upon the **Russia-China** relationship by forcing
**renegotiation** of their existing transit and access
agreements]{.underline}, [and thus may be a **net gain** for the United
States]{.underline} Additionally, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Canada could work to make an **unprecedented**
**joint concession** to their shared native **Inuit** **constituents**
for a multilateral regulation of that maritime region through
**cooperation** with those **tribal governments**]{.underline}.

[Diplomatic engagement by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[to settle its **territorial disputes** would be a means of "**shaping
the rules of the road**]{.underline}"235 [and]{.underline} thereby the
Wilsonian [institutions]{.underline} [of its grand strategic interest by
**clarifying boundaries** and definitions of sovereign
rights]{.underline}. [Arctic economic interests in dispute are **minor**
compared to the **political sovereignty** interests at
stake]{.underline}, yet the U.S. [strategy to pursue]{.underline} and
defend those [sovereign interests is a **wedge** among the **allies'**
**consensus** on the very definition of laws and sovereignty being
defended.]{.underline} The United States should favor establishing
clearly defined international laws, rules, and norms to bolster the
credibility of its Wilsonian international institutional vision, thereby
defending its sovereignty and security interests which are superior to
those minor economic interests within geographically contested spaces.
[The persistence of the **U.S.-Canada** **Arctic** **sovereignty**
disputes is **contradictory** to the U.S.'s grand **strategic interest**
in universal **Wilsonianism** under threat from authoritarian
revisionism.]{.underline}

Wilsonian norms and laws might be weak counterforces to dedicated
revisionism. Without an enforcement agency to deter or punish
transgressions, universal compliance should indeed not be expected. The
argument being made in this section, however, is not that the Wilsonian
vision will enjoy universal unchallenged acceptance, nor to suggest how
transgressions should be addressed. What is being argued here is that by
[failing to even agree upon the rules, the U.S. and its allies have
**undermined** their **vision** without any revisionist
act]{.underline}. [In attempting to build a coalition of partners with a
shared Wilsonian vision, the U.S. loses **moral high ground** and
**credibility** if it cannot define sovereign rights and resolve
**border disputes** with its neighbor and ally.]{.underline} The failure
to do so contributes to this author's conclusion that [U.S. Arctic
strategy is **incoherent** and **diplomatically sparse**]{.underline}.

## 1AR F/L

### 1AR\-\--Canada

#### Canada isnt a leader now -- balancing acts with Trump prevent them from becoming a leader

**Nicholson 6-21 - Development and Fundraising Officer at the Institute
for Peace and Diplomacy** (Fiona Nicholson, "Canada's G7 Presidency:
Renewing Leadership in a Fragile World Order: Symposium", The Institute
for Peace and Diplomacy,
https://peacediplomacy.org/2025/06/21/canadas-g7-presidency-renewing-leadership-in-a-fragile-world-order/

[Canada's G7 presidency offered Prime Minister Mark Carney a challenging
but timely opportunity to signal a more assertive and globally engaged
Canada --- an opportunity he only partially delivered on. While Carney
managed a delicate balancing act in navigating an unpredictable,
Trump-led United States, that caution came at the expense of bolder
leadership]{.underline}.

That said, Carney's choice of non-member invitees, particularly his
diplomatic reconciliation with India, was a pivotal moment, signalling a
shift toward a broader, more inclusive model of global engagement and
diversification. In this respect, Carney laid important early groundwork
for a new era of Canadian multilateral diplomacy.

The summit's outcome, though far from groundbreaking, avoided
controversy --- a feat that is arguably commendable in today's polarized
political climate. [The absence of a joint communiqué was unsurprising,
reflecting the deepening fragmentation among G7 members.]{.underline}
However, this very context could have provided justification for
stronger moves, particularly in distancing Canada from the U.S. position
on climate and the Israel-Palestine conflict. [These are issues Carney
has publicly advocated for, yet that conviction was noticeably absent at
the summit.]{.underline}

[In truth, this points to a deeper issue: a widening lack of consensus
within the West on critical global priorities. Rather than issuing a
vague chair summary, lacklustre in both clarity and ambition, Carney had
an opportunity to define a bold, forward-leaning agenda for Canada --
and somewhat fell short]{.underline}. While his efforts to appease
President Trump were tactically understandable, today's volatile global
landscape demands more than careful diplomacy --- it calls for
principled and decisive leadership.

#### Canada [structurally]{.underline} cannot be a leader

**Greenwalt, \'21 -- William C. Greenwalt is a nonresident senior fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where he focuses on the
expansion of America\'s defense** (William C. Greenwalt; \"O no Canada:
Is a three-eyed AUKUS an augury for change?\"; American Enterprise
Institute;
https://www.aei.org/op-eds/o-no-canada-is-a-three-eyed-aukus-an-augury-for-change/)

Still, as seen by some south of the 49th parallel,
[Canada's]{.underline} **[inability to invest in its
defense]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} the [decades has been a sore
spot]{.underline}. In retrospect, [Canada's]{.underline} [cancellation
of the AVRO arrow i]{.underline}n 1959 --- then one of the most
[advanced jets]{.underline} in the world --- [marked]{.underline} the
[start of a **60-year decline in defense capability**]{.underline}.
[Canadian]{.underline} [defense spending as measured]{.underline} by
percentage of GDP [dropped]{.underline} from 4.2% in 1960
[to]{.underline} a nadir of [0.99%]{.underline} in 2014. As a result of
paying for its welfare state, the size and quality of [Canada's
**defense forces and its innovativeness inevitably
declined**]{.underline}. [Operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline} further [financially strapped the
Canadians]{.underline}, and planned modernization efforts were put on
hold. Radars, ships, and planes continue to depreciate and deteriorate
while the [Arctic increasingly risks becoming a Chinese and Russian
lake.]{.underline}

A strong undersea capability able to deploy to its northern reaches
should be a priority to defend its sovereignty, but instead the
[Canadians]{.underline} continue to [operate]{.underline} a [**decrepit
force** of]{.underline} four 30-year-[old]{.underline} UK castoff
[diesel submarines]{.underline} that the Pakistani Navy didn't even
want. The Royal [Canadian Navy's capabilities are a **far cry** from the
promise]{.underline} when then-President Ronald Reagan in 1988 surprised
the Pentagon and approved the transfer of nuclear submarine propulsion
technology to Canada to build a new class of submarines. Unfortunately,
this [once in a generation chance]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [Canada
to acquire a nuclear submarine]{.underline} capability [never got off
the ground.]{.underline}

#### Canada's is failing on foreign policy -- uncertainty abt their policy on Israel and iran prevents effective leadership

**Babb 5-8 -- Senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute's Center
for North American Prosperity and Security** (Casey Babb, 5-8-2025,
\"The US should be worried about Canada's foreign policy\", The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5288915-the-us-should-be-worried-about-canadas-foreign-policy/)

[Canada is no longer a serious country --- at least not when it comes to
foreign policy and moral fortitude.]{.underline}

Over the last several years, [Ottawa has failed to articulate any
meaningful strategy in response to major global events, while at the
same time jeopardizing some of Canada's most important diplomatic
relations]{.underline}. This should set alarm bells off in Washington.
If Canadian and U.S. foreign policy remain this misaligned, the
consequences for America could be serious.

Consider, for instance, how Canada and the U.S. have approached India
and Israel. Both New Delhi and Jerusalem are critical pillars of the
global democratic architecture. Both face relentless threats from
nonstate actors and revisionist regimes. Both are central to the future
of democratic cooperation.

India is a key partner in pushing back against China's Indo-Pacific
dominance, while Israel is the only liberal democracy in the Middle
East.

The U.S. has, for the most part, treated both Israel and India with
consistency and clarity. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, America
affirmed Israel's right to self-defense while engaging actively on
humanitarian concerns. Likewise, when hitmen allegedly linked to the
Indian government assassinated in British Columbia Hardeep Singh Nijjar,
a leader in the Sikh separatist movement, Washington remained cautious
and disciplined, allowing its intelligence agencies to manage the matter
discreetly while protecting its strategic partnership with India.

[Canada, by contrast, flinched under domestic pressure in both cases,
allowing diaspora politics and electoral calculations to distort its
diplomatic posture, souring relations with two of its most important
allies]{.underline}. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's [public accusation
of Indian state involvement in Nijjar's killing derailed already fragile
ties, leading Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to harshly criticize
Canada and shun Trudeau]{.underline} at the 2023 G20 summit.

A similar drift is evident in Canada's response to Israel's war with
Hamas. O[ttawa initially condemned the terrorist attacks. But in the
face of rising domestic protest and activist pressure, the government's
stance became incoherent --- a muddled blend of contradictory U.N.
votes, hedged statements and an inability to affirm basic principles
such as Israel's right to self-defense.]{.underline} Canada's new prime
minister, Mark Carney, has even echoed the charge that Israel is
committing genocide in Gaza.

Beyond weakening key strategic alliances, Ca[nada has not communicated a
clear vision about the world's most pressing conflict zones. For
instance, Ottawa has repeatedly capitulated to demands from the Chinese
government, while remaining shockingly noncommittal when it comes to
defending Taiwan from a possible Chinese invasion.]{.underline} Waffling
like a feather in the wind, [Canada was also the last member of the Five
Eyes intelligence alliance to ban Chinese government-connected companies
Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks]{.underline}. And while Beijing
continues to carry out everything from widespread foreign interference
operations to espionage to executing Canadian citizens on Chinese soil,
Canadian officials seem fine focusing on "positive developments" between
the two countries.

[On Ukraine, statements of support are clear, but material and financial
assistance is lacking, and Canada has, once again, avoided any clear
long-term strategy for the region. And]{.underline} despite a storied
history of peacekeeping, demilitarizing war zones and brokering peace
agreements, Ottawa's approach to Israel's multifront war in the Middle
East is virtually nonexistent.

[Going forward, Canadian leaders must rediscover that trust and
reliability mean treating allies and issues not as political footballs,
but as long-term partners and problems in a dangerous multipolar world.
If they do not, America might have to make some tough
decisions.]{.underline}

For instance, if Canada cannot be trusted to fully back Israel in its
greatest time of need, can America count on Canada as a credible
security partner? [Further, if Canada fails to muster up the courage to
more forcefully confront China, Washington will have no choice but to
reevaluate everything from economic ties to defense cooperation with
Ottawa]{.underline}. Canada also continues to spend a pittance not just
on its own military, but on support for key allies such as Ukraine and
alliances like NATO. In time, this could increase pressure for the U.S.
to make up for Canada's shortcomings --- something it should not be
expected to do.

All told, while the U.S. under President Trump has made a number of
shocking blunders when it comes to allyship and global engagement, [that
does not excuse the strategic dysfunction of countries like Canada. In
fact, it probably requires allies such as Canada to step up and play an
outsized role to preserve the order we've long taken for granted under
U.S. leadership.]{.underline}

At a time when the U.S. faces serious global challenges and the stakes
are this high, a confused and reactive Canada is one liability America
cannot afford.

#### And no one cares abt Canadian foreign policy -- even amidst trump 

**Caddell 2-19 - Retired Senior Policy Analyst at Global Affiars Canada
and town councillor in Kamouraska, Quebec** (Andrew Caddell, 2-19-2025,
\"Raising Canada's international profile is in our best interests\", The
Hill Times, https://archive.is/hh4kX)

I outlined Canadian reaction to the imposition of tariffs on steel and
aluminum and the patriotic call to fly the Maple Leaf flag on Feb 15. I
explained Canada's relationship with the U.S. in the 20th century, and
how the Cold War began in Ottawa with the revelations of Igor Gouzenko
in September 1945. And while we could grasp George Kennan\'s theory of
containment of the Soviets, and Ronald Reagan\'s \"shining city on a
hill,\" we had to go back to the 19th century---the Monroe Doctrine and
"Manifest Destiny"---to grasp what Trump is now thinking.

And indeed, that was the case in many other panels. [Europe, Latin
America, and Asia have all seen their own respective political and
economic oxen gored by Trump]{.underline}. In contrast, Africa's fear
was being ignored: in light of Trump's cutbacks to USAID and the pullout
from the World Health Organization, there is a fear there would be no
American support for Africa in the future.

[The most worrisome trend for me was the abysmal knowledge of
Canada]{.underline}. Indeed, aside from the awareness of Trump's
vituperative eruptions, Canada didn't figure in anyone's assessments.
[In a session on NATO, Canada was never mentioned, even though we are
its seventh largest contributor.]{.underline} When I asked the lead
participant, an Italian-American who lectures on NATO, he said it was
due to the focus on European capacity for defence. In a session on
international trade, Mexico and China were named as America's primary
trading partners, not Canada.

As this phenomenon repeated itself in private conversations, it [struck
me there was an immense need for Canada to be recognized as we would
neither be taken seriously by the Americans in any negotiation nor be
supported by allies if perceived as inconsequential on the world
stage.]{.underline}

In a recent report in La Presse, former Canadian ambassador to
Washington Raymond Chrétien said of our once-good relationship with the
U.S.: "[All that has just fallen by the wayside. We once negotiated
hard, but with respect. Never with threats. And now we\'re
threatened]{.underline}." However, for those who believe we should cut
hydro power to threaten the U.S., he added, "Americans won't negotiate
with a knife to their throat."

### 1AR \-\-- Multilat Impact

#### No multilat impact -- that's Maull. 

#### 1 -- Compromises and lowest common denominators characterize agreements 

#### 2 -- Negotiations are protracted and costly -- only creates an illusion we're making progress

#### 3 -- Noncompliance issues

**Feffer 21** \[John Feffer is the director of Foreign Policy in Focus

Institute in Seoul, "Multilateralism and the Biden Administration,"

https://rosalux.nyc/multilateralism-and-the-biden-administration/\]

[A]{.underline} second [challenge for multilateralism is non-compliance.
**If powerful countries don't want to abide by international rules, they
simply don't.** The United States has demonstrated this
problem]{.underline} of non-compliance repeatedly over the years, [most
recently on drone warfare and refugee policy. Russia in Crimea and China
in the South China Sea have also flouted international law.
Even]{.underline} relatively [weak countries]{.underline} have managed
to [**defy international** agreements and **authorities**]{.underline},
as North Korea has done in developing its nuclear weapons program.
Non-compliance triggers penalties such as economic sanctions, but
[countries are often **willing to absorb those penalties.**]{.underline}

This problem of non-compliance will become ever more salient on
environmental questions. [Many governments]{.underline} have [pledged to
become carbon neutral by 2050. But there are **no enforcement
mechanisms** to keep countries to their word. **Nor**]{.underline} are
there [international **authorities to pressure countries** into making
those pledges in the first place.]{.underline} As an aspect of the
collective action problem, [non-compliance is a **feature of
multilateralism across the board**, whether non-proliferation, pandemic
suppression, or the treatment of public commons like the oceans,
cyberspace, or outer space.]{.underline} But with the Doomsday Clock of
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists still a mere 100 second from midnight,
non-compliance carries with it unprecedented existential risks for the
human race.

Finally, [there is the problem of governance. There is **no global
government** and thus no democratic way to regulate global affairs.
Multilateralism]{.underline} is one response to this problem of
governance. It [asserts that governments]{.underline}, as the
representatives of their people, [cooperate on a state-to-state basis to
solve collective problems.]{.underline} Governments pool their resources

#### Missile defense strengthens Canadian leadership by giving them decision making power and leverage with America

**Teeple 20 -- Post-Doctoral Fellow at NAADSN** (Nancy Teeple,
08-07-2020, "Canada and Missile Defence: A New Strategic Context
Requires Revisiting Participation", North American and Arctic Defense
and Security Network,
https://www.naadsn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20-August_Teeple_Policy-Brief-Canada-Missile-Defence.pdf

However, with the advent of new threats to North

America through advances in missile technology

(new hypersonic missiles, advanced cruise missiles,

and standoff ballistic missiles with unpredictable

trajectories) designed to evade early warning

detection, tracking, and interception by current

systems, the evolving concept of North American

defence and its requisite architecture requires a reevaluation in Canada
of its willingness to join missile

defence; or provide some form of contribution to

the system in return for receiving protection under

US Ground Based Interceptors.

1 This is particularly

necessary in light of emerging concepts for

increasing the integration of defence systems for an

all-domain awareness capability, as the US develops

its role as an Arctic nation and pursuit of a military

footprint in the North.

Canada and the US are partners in North American

defence through the binational NORAD and bilateral

agreements, related to Canada's geostrategic

position at the top of the continent. Considerations

under study of the evolution of North American

Defence (EvoNAD) 2 include new deterrence

concepts with the advent of emerging domains

2

(space and cyber) posing a complex array of threats

to the US and Canada. Deterrence concepts

involving responding to new missile threats include

integrating defensive and offensive measures to

deter, disrupt, degrade, and destroy threats before

they reach their targets. The 2019 Missile Defence

Review outlines four missions: deterrence, passive

defence, active defence, and attack operations -- the

latter involving targeting the platforms (i.e. the

archers) rather than the missiles themselves (or

arrows). 3 This moves beyond BMD towards a

broader Missile Defence 4 concept, responding to

the spectrum of threats posed by new systems with

deterrence-by-denial (part of US nuclear doctrine

combining deterrence by denial and punishment),

providing an assortment of offensive and defensive

options. Layered concepts involving supplementing

GMD (including the planned new GBIs) with Aegis

and THAAD for more comprehensive defence of

North America have been recently proposed.5

In light of the increasing uncertainty and complexity

of the global security environment, and particularly

the threats posed to North American -- as the

continent is no longer a sanctuary according to the

current NORAD Commander 6 -- Canada might

reconsider how it views requirements for strategic

stability and to ensure national security. Canada has

demonstrated a decline in its advocacy for nuclear

disarmament over the past two decades, and

particularly since 2014, aligning its national security

and defence interests more closely with those of the

US. To that end, Canada should now reverse this

trend and embrace its role as a key partner in North

American defence within the new integrated

system-of-systems concept, through increased

contribution to missile defence; or consider making

a deal with the US in order to receive protection.

Framework

The framework for assessing Canada's role in

binational missile defence from a political-strategic

approach rests on the real and perceived benefits of

participation; namely a "piece of the action" and a

"seat at the table." 7 Participation provides

opportunities for Canada to be a stronger partner in

the binational command structure and bilateral

defence of North America. In a time of increasing

strategic uncertainty of advances in missile

technologies by great power and rogue state

adversaries, Canada's security may best be

guaranteed by joining the US missile defence

program. Indeed, with an observable shift in

Canada's approach to nuclear issues8 -- a formal role

that aligns with the defence interests of the United

States is likely to direct Canadian national interests

towards participation in missile defence, as part of

evolving North American Defence. One of the

greatest obstacles, however, is that the initiative is

treated by political parties and candidates to as a

partisan issue, rather than a national security

priority. This has to change.

Recommendations

• Renew the dialogue with US on the requirements

and benefits of cooperation for Canada in the

current North American security and defence

context.9

• The dialogue should include a public debate on the

benefits and costs of participation versus nonparticipation in the
program in light of the increasing

strategic threats to the West and North America.

• Consideration of Canadian niche capabilities and

geographical advantages in how it can best

contribute to missile defence. This includes

exploring kinetic and non-kinetic options:

3

• A non-kinetic role can involve offensive cyber

operations to detect, disrupt, or deter

adversaries' launch capabilities -- these can be

can be tantamount to kinetic effects.

• Binational cooperation with the US on cruise

missile defence by providing interceptors by air,

ground, and sea-based platforms. There is an

established framework in NATO for this (Art. V)

and consistency with BMD in Europe.10

• A dedicated co-located radar enhancing

Canada's early warning role in both NORAD and a

formal participation in missile defence. One

proposal in 2005 suggested and X-band radar site

in Goose Bay -- this would be a timely option for

consideration with developments in Iran's longrange ballistic missile
capabilities.11

• Enhanced space situational awareness directly

linking US-Canada space cooperation with missile

defence.12

• Consideration of incremental steps in the level of

Canadian participation from an enhanced early

warning/detection role (such as hosting a radar on

the East Coast), to cruise missile defence and

potentially hosting ground-based interceptors in the

future.

Benefits to Canada

• Access to new emerging technology and claiming

a niche (such as space sensor or imagery capability).

• Having a seat at the table and being a part of the

action involving decisions on how to respond to the

range of threats to North America.

• Economic and commercial: Canadian industry

would be involved in developing the capabilities

comprising Canada initial and ongoing contribution

to missile defence.

• Participation could provide a way to offset US

criticism for not paying the minimum 2% of GDP on

defence.

• Participation would increase the credibility of

Canada's military contribution to North American

defence, in light of delayed procurements and aging

systems. This addresses the Strong Secure Engaged

second pillar and commitment to be "secure in

North America."

Trade-Offs

Participation and non-participation each have tradeoffs. The associated
risks of participation and nonparticipation described below are not
equal in value

in terms of the costs/benefits analysis of

involvement in missile defence; rather, some costs

will be acceptable in light of the greater value

provided by benefits of participation. The reality is

that there is always a cost for any defence program

to enhance national security and commitment to

partners and allies -- these involve political, security,

economic, and social costs. Timing, however,

creates constraints on moving forward on this issue,

potentially pushing it further into the future,

particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic has created

an urgency that redirects defence and security

resources towards emergency responses

#### Missile defense benefits Canada more than America and makes them a preeminent global power

**Beaver and Peters 05-13** (Wilson Beaver and Robert Peters,
05-13-2025, "North American Security: U.S.-- Canadian Defense
Priorities", The Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/BG3906.pdf)

The Arctic became a strategic priority for the United States early in

the Cold War, with the foundation of North American Aerospace Defense

Command (NORAD), sensors along the Distance Early Warning line, and

the stationing of U.S. forces, including an air base designed to detect
and, if

necessary, defeat Soviet air forces over the Arctic, in Greenland.4

Starting

in the 1950s, Canada was also instrumental in the operation of the Sound

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 3

heritage.org

Surveillance System, with which American and Canadian naval officers

tracked Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic.5

Still today, in deterring aggression by adversaries like China and
Russia

or rogue nations like North Korea, the United States must ensure that

North America's northern flank is secure. As the Canadian think tank the

Macdonald-Laurier Institute puts it:

\[T\]he Canadian Arctic is an exposed flank of North America---an
obvious path

for cruise and hypersonic missiles to pass through on their way to
targets in

the United States. For this reason, the Arctic has been a military
theater since

the advent of nuclear weapons and the beginning of the Cold War.6

Russia and, increasingly, China are active in the Arctic, with both
maritime and air assets increasingly operating in the High North. In
2024,

Russian Tu-95MS Bear bombers and Chinese Xian H-6K bombers operated

jointly within Alaska's Air Defense Identification Zone for the first
time.7

In

addition, Russian bombers capable of launching the Kodiak cruise
missile,

an air-launched nuclear-capable cruise missile with a range of
2,500--2,800

kilometers, are increasingly operating over the Arctic.8

If launched over

the Arctic Circle, such weapons could strike targets in most of Canada
and

much of the United States with a nuclear warhead and little tactical
warning.

This is just one of the many nuclear-capable systems that can target
much

of North America that Russia is developing.

During the Cold War, the United States and Canada relied upon the

American nuclear arsenal to deter Soviet bombers coming over the Arctic,

and both nations had a robust line of radar and sensor stations, as well
as air

bases designed to intercept and, if necessary, destroy such bombers.9

Today,

that capability has atrophied, with many bases closing, and the American

and Canadian air forces significantly smaller than what they were at the

height of the Cold War.10

That must change. The United States and Canada must reconstitute the

capability to identify, engage, and, deter adversaries from using the
Arctic

as a means to threaten North America through the High North. And the

reason for that is simple---not only may Canada itself be a target for
such

an attack should there be a general war between NATO and either one of

the autocracies in Beijing or Moscow, but because any attack vector that

targets the continental United States through the Artic would have to
overfly Canada. In such a scenario, Chinese or Russian
missiles---potentially

nuclear-armed---would spend hours violating Canadian air space on their

way to targets in the American homeland. Indeed, virtually any American

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 4

heritage.org

conflict with China or Russia would put Canada at risk if the High North

were not secured from missile attack. It is for this reason that
Canada---with

significant material, technological, and manpower support from the
United

States---should take the lead on re-establishing a robust and credible
air

defense perimeter along its Arctic coastline.

Such a defensive perimeter would include the aforementioned early
warning sensors, radar installations, and expanded air interceptor
presence. It

would likely also include an increased number of ground-based
missile-integrated air and missile defenses, such as the Patriot or
Terminal High Altitude

Air Defense (THAAD) systems, capable of engaging and destroying a
variety

of airborne threats. Such a presence also would include a greater number
of

Canadian or American fighter aircraft at existing bases---and,
potentially, a

reopening of shuttered Cold War air bases in the Canadian High North.

Such bases could house Canadian or American service personnel operating
the early warning stations, missile defense batteries, or air bases.
Such a

distributed series of bases would not only give greater coverage across
the

Arctic---which would increase chances of successful early detection and
interception of adversary threats---but also increased redundancy,
meaning that

if one base was destroyed, holes within the defensive architecture would
not

materialize.11 That is, if large swaths of the Canadian High North were
defended

or covered by only single installations, the loss of a single station,
if destroyed,

would create gaps in the North American defensive posture that
adversaries

could exploit and thereby increase the chances of a successful attack.12

Beyond air defenses, it is critical that Canada and the United States
have

a more robust maritime presence in the Arctic. Increasingly, Chinese and

Russian surface ships and submarines operate in the Arctic. Such surface

ships can perform a number of functions, to include surveillance and
reconnaissance operations, as well as a means to generate long-range
fires. Indeed,

the sea-launched Kalibr long-range nuclear-capable cruise missile has
been

employed with success in Syria and in Ukraine.13

Without question, should war between NATO and Beijing or Moscow

erupt, the autocrats would be tempted to secure maritime dominance in
the

Arctic, particularly if they see it as an undefended vulnerability that
they

could exploit. For this reason, a strengthened Canadian naval presence
in

the Arctic, in the form of icebreakers, destroyers, submarines, and
groundand air-launched anti-ship missiles are needed to deter and, if
necessary,

destroy Chinese or Russian naval assets operating in the Arctic Ocean.

Canadian National Security Strategy. Canada's current national defense

strategy is mostly aligned with this vision, and Canadian national
security

experts tend to agree with this focus as well. In 2024, the Canadian
Ministry

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 5

heritage.org

of National Defense published Our North, Strong and Free: A Renewed
Vision

for Canada's Defense, which correctly identifies the Arctic and the
defense of

North America as Canada's two biggest security priorities, saying:

We must place particular focus on defending the Arctic and North and its

approaches against new and accelerating threats through credible
deterrence.

We will secure our Arctic and North by increasing the presence, reach,
mobility

and responsiveness of the Canadian Armed Forces in the region, and along
our

coasts and maritime approaches. We will also develop greater striking
power

to deter adversaries and keep threats farther from our shores.14

In terms of realizing this vision, the strategy calls for expanding
Canada's

aging submarine fleet, acquiring specialized maritime sensors that can
be

rapidly deployed on Canadian Arctic and offshore patrol vessels for
ocean

surveillance in the High North, the construction of a new satellite
ground

station, and the procurement of new tactical helicopters, ground-based
air

defenses, and long-range missile capabilities. These are all good
measures

and steps in the right direction.

The issue, however, is that Canadian national security strategy is
insufficiently funded and that it attempts to pursue other, secondary
priorities

that will only serve as strategic distractions to Canada's biggest
priorities.

Defense Spending. Canada's national defense strategy is not funded

sufficiently to realize its goals. The current Canadian government has
projected Canada's defense-spending-to-GDP ratio to only hit 1.76
percent by

2029--2030 and 2 percent by 2032--2033.15 In comparison with the
increases

across the rest of the alliance, this does not display any sense of
urgency

from the current Canadian government. Canada is already one of the
lowest

spenders in NATO, and the 2 percent conversation is not going away, with

Canada coming under increased scrutiny as the majority of NATO now

meets the 2 percent spending target that all member states have agreed

to.16 Increasingly, calls for hitting the 2 percent minimum come not
just

from the United States, but from other NATO members that far exceed the

target, like Estonia and Poland, or from previously delinquent members

that have in recent years finally hit the 2 percent minimum, like
Germany.

Canada can reach this target through investments in its own security and

infrastructure, with spending that helps Canadian sovereignty and also
provides

jobs to Canadians. It is important to note that this is not just about
spending

money as a political or face-saving measure to appease allies: It is
about spending

money to make the Canadian military more capable---and therefore more
effective---in dealing with threats to North America and as a vital
member of NATO.

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 6

heritage.org

Focusing on What Is Primary. The Canadian Armed Forces are already

operating under a limited budget and will struggle to achieve their
primary

goals of securing the Arctic and North America if they allocate too much

funding and effort to other priorities.

For example, Canada's main international effort at present is Operation

Reassurance, under which Canada acts as the Framework nation for the

NATO Multinational Brigade in Latvia, deterring Russian aggression.17

Canada's efforts there have been appreciated, but if Canada is to focus
in a

meaningful way on Arctic security and continental defense, it may need
to

scale back its troop presence and operational activity in Latvia.
Germany is

moving to permanently station an armored brigade next door in Lithuania,

and another Western European country should be acting as Framework

nation in Latvia or working with Riga to permanently station troops
there

to deter the Russians from an attack on the Baltics. It is unlikely to
make

sense for Canada to continue in this role indefinitely.

Likewise, equipment or units intended for ground operations, like
peacekeeping and counterinsurgency, should take a back seat to funding
for air

and naval capabilities.

Procurement. Canadian procurement of weapon systems for the foreseeable
future should focus on naval and air capabilities relevant to its

mission to defend the Arctic and North America. This will mark a
noticeable shift from recent years during which Canadian ground forces
have

received much of the funding priority as a result of Canada's main
efforts

being counterinsurgency or peacekeeping operations in the Middle East

and the deployment of a ground combat brigade to Latvia.

As noted earlier, more interceptor aircraft are needed to cover down

on threats coming from the Arctic. In 2023, Canada decided to purchase

88 F-35As. These state-of-the-art aircraft are increasingly becoming

the "NATO standard" aircraft and are almost certainly better than any

aircraft flown by Chinese or Russian air forces---and will remain a
topof-the-line aircraft for decades to come. Canada will have to invest
in

training new pilots, expanding or updating infrastructure at key air

bases, and training pilots and crew members needed to ensure that

the United States and Canada can field a credible air defense over the

Arctic.18 Recent disagreements over tariffs have led some to question

whether Canada should move ahead with the F-35 deal, but there simply

is no viable alternative for the Canadian military, with other options

from European suppliers inferior to the fifth-generation F-35 in
capability. Additionally, these options are still subject to the broader
U.S. and

NATO supply chain, just like the F-35.19

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 7

heritage.org

Canada should furthermore work with the United States to procure
additional early warning radar and sensors to identify inbound threats,
as well as

the Patriot and THAAD systems. It should also modernize and expand its
fleet

of submarines and destroyers, such that it is capable of credibly
deterring and,

if necessary, defeating adversary threats within the Arctic. Given the
needs of

operating for long periods in the Arctic environment, Canadian
submarines

need to be long-range diesel-electric submarines with the ability to
patrol for

significant lengths of time without refueling.20 Purchasing nuclear
submarines

from the United States, unfortunately, is not a viable option due to the
prohibitively high costs involved and the serious problems the United
States has

had in keeping Virginia-class nuclear submarines on time and under
budget.

Canada has a number of options for the procurement of diesel submarines,

with the South Korean option being one of the most likely.21 The Korean
option

makes the most sense in many ways, as the design is already complete and

Korean shipbuilding consistently avoids cost overruns and delivery
delays.22

Finally, Canada should make a serious investment in acquiring the
River-class destroyers. The River-class is a guided-missile,
helicopter-capable

destroyer with significant anti-submarine warfare and air defense
capabilities

that will replace Canada's already retired Iroquois-class destroyers and
its

aging Halifax-class frigates.23 Though there has been debate about what
the

eventual cost of the program will be, the official estimate is that the
15 ships

will cost an estimated 56 billion to 60 billion Canadian dollars. In
American

procurement debates, it is rare to discuss the cost of an entire program
over

its life cycle (instead, the cost is discussed in terms of a per-unit
cost for a

single ship or the annual cost in the budget cycle), but many in Canada
have

focused on this total cost instead of the cost of a single ship or the
annual cost

of the program which, spread out over decades, appears far more
reasonable.

Not only are the above-mentioned vessels necessary for security, but

it is also good for Canadian workers and industry to build the
River-class

destroyers in Canada, bringing thousands of direct and indirect jobs and

millions of dollars into government coffers. Construction on the first
of the

ships began in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2024, and the first three ships
will

be the HMCS Fraser, Saint-Laurent, and Mackenzie.

24

Infrastructure. The Canadian government's 2024 Evaluation of Arctic

Operations found:

The CAF's \[Canadian Air Force\] northern infrastructure is located far
apart and

can only provide limited support for large or sustained deployments. To
further

complicate the issue...the condition of Arctic infrastructure is well
below the

CAF average and, without intervention, will soon move to the 'rust out'
stage.25

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 8

heritage.org

Investment in Arctic infrastructure will be a necessary aspect of
Canadian efforts to reassert Ottawa's sovereignty in the Canadian
Arctic. Airfields

need to be expanded to accommodate Canada's new F-35s and P-8 Poseidon

aircraft, and port facilities would need to be added to facilitate
maritime

surveillance and icebreaking by Canadian ships.

From the perspective of Canadian policymakers and citizens, a positive

side effect of this need will be improved infrastructure for Canadian
residents of Arctic provinces like Nunavut. For logistical reasons, it
makes the

most sense to collocate improved airfields and port facilities with
major

population centers, which will both employ locals in construction and

maintenance and improve economic links with major population centers

in the rest of Canada. Such investments are necessary to not only secure

North America's northern flank but would also provide much-needed jobs

and investments for the peoples living in Canada's High North in remote

areas that struggle to attract economic investment.

Indeed, such an investment and reopening of shuttered Cold War--era

bases could bring economic prosperity to a number of otherwise isolated

communities. Such prosperity would be augmented by increased services

in the region, to include medical, education, and energy resources. In

particular, infrastructure investment in airfields and ports in Canadian

Arctic provinces like Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon

would facilitate easier travel and increased trade for residents, while
also

providing for the agile employment of Canadian air and maritime assets

throughout the region.

Arctic Collaboration with Scandinavia and the United States.

Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO, along with the efforts of
longtime NATO members Denmark and Norway, presents an opportunity for

a dramatic expansion of NATO Arctic collaboration among the United

States, Canada, and Scandinavian NATO members. An October 2024 joint

statement put out by the defense ministers of Canada, the Scandinavian

nations, and the United States reaffirmed the leading role these
countries

play in ensuring stability in the Arctic and discussed opportunities to

enhance information- and intelligence-sharing to create a common
operating picture, as well as ways to increase collaboration to address
common

challenges in the region.26 The Canadian focus on Arctic security will
not

separate it from NATO and will not isolate it, but will instead allow it
to act

as a regional anchor state with strong bilateral and multilateral
military ties

to the other NATO Arctic states.

One clear capability that Canada has maintained is its icebreaker fleet,

and the 2024 deal with Canada, Finland, and the United States on
producing

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 9

heritage.org

icebreakers demonstrates an area in which Canada can act as a force
multiplier. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a serious
interest

in expanding icebreaker capabilities both for the U.S. and across the
U.S.

alliance network. This represents a real opportunity for Canada to be
forward-leaning in security engagement with the U.S. It may be possible
for

Canada to repurpose or reclassify existing icebreakers to give them a
more

explicitly defense role, adding to Canadian national security efforts in
the

Arctic and signaling intent to do more.

Canadian efforts to expand their own icebreaker fleet will be welcomed

by all. A Heritage Foundation Special Report, "A Strategy to Revitalize
the

Defense Industrial Base for the 21st Century," singled out icebreakers
as

one of the most promising sectors for defense industrial base
collaboration

between the United States and Canada.27

Beyond maritime operations in the Arctic, Canada has for decades

played a pivotal role in continental security through NORAD. Long

serving as the sentinel of the Arctic, Canadian military personnel have

patrolled the skies and manned the radar and sensor areas along its high

north, watching for missile or air threats traversing the Arctic to
North

America. Its military personnel have served in key leadership positions

within NORAD, and the United States and Canada have engaged in joint

strategic research stretching back to the days of the Manhattan project.
Canada can once again demonstrate its leadership in continental

defense by championing and building a new generation of sensor and

radar arrays optimized to detect air and missile threats bound for North

America.28 This is critical, as the emerging hypersonic missile threat

posed by China and Russia---coupled with their existing ballistic
missile

and air threats---will become an ever growing challenge to North
American security.29

Supply-Chain Integration. Defense Production Act Title III allows the

U.S. government to "create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore"
industrial

base activities.30 Canada's relationship with the U.S. Department of
Defense

through the Defense Production Act is unique, in that Canadian companies

can be considered part of the U.S. industrial base and are thus eligible
for U.S.

government investment. This unique arrangement presents an opportunity

for both Ottawa and Washington.31

The Department of Defense will continue to divest itself from
Chinese-controlled critical mineral supply chains, an effort that
presents

opportunities for Canada. During the first Trump Administration, the

U.S.--Canadian Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals was announced. The

plan outlined bilateral financial investments in the production of
critical

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 10

heritage.org

minerals in North America and has made some serious progress in the
years

since it began. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense announced awards

of \$6.4 million and \$8.3 million, respectively, to Canadian companies
Fortune Minerals Limited and Lomiko Metals, Inc., as part of the Defense

Production Act Investment program to support production of cobalt and

graphite.32 The Canadian government announced similar investments in

these companies.

China. It would make no sense for the United States to ask Canada to

prepare for conflict in the South China Sea, and nobody is doing so.
Canada's military posture and defense spending should focus on defending
its

own sovereignty in North America and the Arctic both against China and

Russia---but there are still things Canada can do to contribute to
deterring

China from launching a war of aggression in the Indo--Pacific. Canada
can

play an important role diplomatically and in terms of economic security

and research security to send the right messages on China, and, to a
lesser

extent, also engage in partner-building exercises and training with
nations

like the Philippines.

Canada has a vested interest in pushing back against China, as Beijing

has repeatedly targeted Canada in recent years with cyberattacks,
election interference, and the execution of Canadian citizens.33 Passing
laws to

prevent malign foreign influence from China, hardening Canadian
government systems against cyberattack, condemning Chinese aggression
against

countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, and preventing the transfer
of

defense-related technology are all proactive steps Canada can take to
push

back against China---while not distracting Canadian military spending
and

planning from the core mission of securing the Arctic and North America.

Additionally, Canada's development of pipelines and export facilities

on its Pacific coast present both an opportunity for economic growth for

Canada and a strategic benefit to the Indo--Pacific, with Canada
offering

an alternative to the Middle Eastern--sourced imports on which Japan and

South Korea rely that would be under threat in the event of a
conflict.34

Cross-Border Security. In recent months, the most pressing U.S. security
issue that has been identified is the cross-border trafficking of drugs
and

people. The Trump Administration is working to undo years of open-border

policies by the Biden Administration, correctly identifying these
open-border policies as being the root cause of drug deaths and rising
crime in the

United States, as well an opportunity for foreign terrorist groups to
smuggle

terrorists into the United States.

Canada's government will need to do a lot more to address this issue
both

for the security of the United States and for the security and
well-being

BACKGROUNDER \| No. 3906 May 13, 2025 \| 11

heritage.org

of Canadian citizens. The presence of large numbers of unvetted foreign

nationals and expired visa-holders is a security threat to Canadian
citizens,

and the cross-border trafficking of drugs hurts both American and
Canadian

citizens. The U.S.--Canadian border is the longest undefended border in
the

world, a situation that has long benefitted the United States and
Canada, but

that is only possible if both countries collaborate to prevent
cross-border

criminal activities.

Recommendations

There are a number of actions Canada and the United States can take

to secure the Arctic and the North American continent, deter adversary

aggression, and provide better infrastructure to its citizens living in
the

most remote areas of Canada. These include:

l Focus on primary concerns. Operating from an already limited

budget, Canada cannot afford to spread itself thin. Diverting funds to

secondary concerns is a strategic distraction Canada cannot afford.

Arctic security and continental defense must be prioritized.

l Upgrade existing bases and build new bases in the High North.

These bases will serve to enable air interceptor missions, support

expanded early-warning sensor and radar packages, and serve as

missile interceptor sites, securing North America against expanding

missile threats from China and Russia.

l Work together on missile defense. U.S. lawmakers need to support

funding for Golden Dome and other missile defense projects and work

closely with their Canadian counterparts to secure North America.

#### And trump wont annex Canada

Maass 2-14 - (Richard Maass, 2-14-2025, \"The 51st State That Never Was:

https://warontherocks.com/2025/02/the-51st-state-that-never-was-why-the-united-states-didnt-annex-canada/

For all Trump's talk, the chances of the United States annexing Canada
during his second term remain low. The Canadian public overwhelmingly
opposes it (90 percent, according to a recent survey by the Angus Reid
Institute) and the U.S. public does too. With no deal in sight, it is
far more likely that Trump intends his expansionist rhetoric to unsettle
the diplomatic status quo in service of other goals. As former senior
adviser to Trudeau Gerald Butts remarked, "Trump used this '51st State'
line with Trudeau a lot during his first term. He's doing it to rattle
Canadian cages."

This does not mean that Trump's rhetoric is inconsequential --- far from
it. Trump's talk of territorial expansion has already generated
important consequences. Most notably, it has served up rhetorical
ammunition to other revisionist powers, especially Russia. Beyond
reasserting Russian interests in the Arctic (which both Canada and
Greenland touch), Russian media figures have already used Trump's
statements to defend Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, even saying
that "Trump's position essentially gave Moscow the right to demand the
restoration of its own former Soviet empire, including the Baltic
nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia." Such whataboutism muddies the
waters of international diplomacy in ways that erode the soft power
derived from 75 years of strong U.S. support for the territorial
integrity norm. Even as various aspects of U.S. foreign policy have
sparked resistance --- from Cold War interventions to the War on Terror
--- the United States has consistently attracted allies and partners in
other regions in part because they know that they have less to fear from
it than from their neighbors. The less distinguishable U.S. foreign
policy becomes from Russian or Chinese foreign policy, the fewer reasons
other countries have to favor U.S. interests over those of its
geopolitical rivals.

Second, Trump's expansionist rhetoric undermines U.S. national security
by impairing its alliances and border security. Trump has long failed to
understand NATO's significance, threatening to withdraw the United
States from the alliance during his first term. Any alliance is only as
strong as the political will behind it, so Trump does not need to
withdraw from NATO to fundamentally weaken it. How can U.S. allies count
on someone to help defend them who refuses to rule out using force to
conquer territory from one of those very allies? Diluting alliance
cohesion weakens the United States by reducing the likelihood that its
partners will offer their own support when it is needed --- as they did
after 9/11, the only time NATO's Article 5 has ever been invoked.

Beyond its alliances, any military strategist or scholar of
international relations will observe that the single greatest advantage
the United States has over its geopolitical rivals is its geography:
namely, stable continental borders that have facilitated relatively
amicable relationships with its neighbors for more than a century. In
Joseph Nye's words, echoed by countless others: "The United States is
surrounded by two oceans and two friendly neighbors, while China shares
a border with fourteen other countries and is engaged in territorial
disputes with several." This results in vastly different force postures
and capabilities. While China's military is rapidly modernizing, much of
its strength is deployed along its lengthy land borders with Russia and
India. In contrast, the U.S. military can focus much of its attention on
various overseas theaters precisely because the U.S.-Canadian border has
been demilitarized for so long.

Dispute with Canada Over the Legal Status of the Northwest Passage"
William and Mary Law Review,
https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&context=wmlronline)

C. Security [If the United States opens the Northwest Passage to
maritime traffic, it effectively invites its great power adversaries
into its vulnerable backyard]{.underline}. The Arctic is home to large
deposits of oil, natural gas, and liquid natural gas---the fossil fuels
upon which the world relies for energy.120 Perhaps more importantly,
however, the Arctic contains vast quantities of minerals that are
critical to the technologies behind renewable energy, from electric cars
to wind turbines.121 And yet, many Arctic borders are uncertain; Arctic
states lay competing claims to exclusive economic zones and continental
shelf limits,122 which govern resource rights to the sea floor.123 Some
of the aforementioned resources exist in contested areas.124 As a
result, the region is vulnerable to interstate conflict. Because of
competing claims in the Arctic and the mineral rights those claims
confer, the Arctic is a likely arena for the emerging cold war between
the West and its Russo-Chinese rivals. Even before Russia's re-invasion
of Ukraine in 2022, the United States began preparing for the
reemergence of great power competition in the wake of Russia's 2014
invasion of Ukraine, the Sino-American trade war, and China's threats
toward Taiwan.125 [As this rivalry develops, both Russia and China have
demonstrated interest in the Arctic. Russia, itself an Arctic state with
unrecognized claims in the region, has spent the last two decades
militarizing its Arctic territory and undermining U.S. allies' security
in the Arctic.126 Russia sees the Arctic as "a new front" in its war on
the West, and on this front,]{.underline} Russia's military presence
dwarfs that of the United States and its allies.127 Despite China's
distance from the Arctic, "China has declared itself a 'near-Arctic
state'" and joined the Arctic Council as an observer, underlining its
interests in the region.128 China is increasingly playing an important
role in the development of the Russian Arctic,129 and the Chinese and
Russian militaries have begun to cooperate in the Arctic.130 [This
should be a matter of critical concern for the United States and Canada:
the Arctic is North America's "most vulnerable avenue of
approach]{.underline}," considering the proximity of Russia and the vast
disparity between Russian and U[.S. or Canadian military assets and
infrastructure in the region.131 The Arctic is, in effect, the back door
to the United States---and it is currently wide open. Though Russia has
displayed its willingness to enter into a conventional interstate war,
the primary concern for the United States and Canada in the Arctic
should be grey zone threats.]{.underline} Grey zone threats include any
of a number of coercive tactics that fall short of warfare, including
espionage, sabotage, border incursions, and paramilitary forces.132
Russia has already used such tactics in the Arctic against the United
States and its allies, from "embedding spies in research institutes" and
jamming military GPS systems to using ostensibly civilian vessels to cut
undersea cables.133 Perhaps the greatest threat, though, is that of
paramilitary forces, the use of which allows a state to launch direct
attacks (sometimes even with military units) while maintaining plausible
deniability. Russia debuted this tactic when it invaded Ukraine in 2014
and seized Crimea with its "little green men"---conventional military
units that had removed any insignias identifying them as Russian
soldiers.134 China has applied a similar tactic to a maritime context,
attacking U.S., Filipino, Malaysian, and Vietnamese ships in the South
China Sea with its "little blue men"---a maritime militia of ships
ostensibly engaged in commercial fishing but which in fact operate
alongside Chinese law enforcement and the Chinese military to achieve
Chinese political objectives in disputed waters.135 [If the right of
transit passage applies to the Northwest Passage, as the United States
argues it should, then Canada legally cannot close the Passage to
maritime traffic]{.underline}.136 The aforementioned grey zone threats,
from paramilitaries to saboteurs, would blend in with civilian traffic,
as they are designed to maintain plausible deniability or the veneer of
civilian activities.137 [The United States and Canada do not have the
Arctic resources or infrastructure to adequately police that threat;138
even if they did, threats can and do slip through.139 The safer and less
resource-intensive route is to deny passage to foreign vessels. As North
American defense is a joint operation between the United States and
Canada,140 the United States would have a say in policing actions in the
Northwest Passage and determinations of what vessels may transit the
Passage]{.underline}. [Thus, keeping the Northwest Passage closed to
maritime traffic is vital to U.S. security, even if to do so, Canada
must be the country with legal authority over the Passage.]{.underline}
D. Diplomatic [The U.S. position vis-à-vis the Northwest Passage is
unnecessarily antagonist to one of the United States' most important
allies. Canada regards its Arctic territories as "fundamental to \[its\]
national identity]{.underline}."141 U[.S. freedom of navigation
operations in the Northwest Passage, absent requests to Canada and
despite Canada's claims, have been a source of uproar in Canada's
Parliament and among the Canadian public.142 And yet, the United States
keeps performing such operations---sometimes without even notifying
Canada.143 With the return of great power competition, the United States
cannot afford to alienate one of its most important allies.]{.underline}
Further, Russia or China could exploit such division by sailing through
the Northwest Passage,144 in which case Canada's legal position would
prompt a Canadian intervention, while the U.S. legal position would
compel U.S. inaction. A [united diplomatic front, particularly in the
contested Arctic, is critical for U.S. interests.]{.underline} \* \* \*
Despite the age-old economic allure of a maritime trade route through
the Northwest Passage, the viability of such a route is questionable,145
and it would only degrade a fragile environment and undermine U.S.
security. Further, the U.S. position is antagonistic to one of its most
important allies. [Accordingly, the United States should reverse its
position that the Northwest Passage is an international strait and
instead look towards a legal solution that gives Canada the ability to
control (and severely limit, if not prohibit) maritime traffic in the
Passage. The United States' important role in North American security
would guarantee that, though Canada controls the Passage, the United
States would have a say in its management, allowing the United States to
protect its own interests in the Arctic.]{.underline}

#### Recognizing [sovereignty]{.underline} is a [silver bullet]{.underline}, even amid Trump.

**Edwards 3-16**, \*MA, International Journalism, University of London,
Reporter, Newsweek, (\*Joe, March 16, 2025, "New Canadian PM Mark Carney
Heads to Europe Amid Clash With Donald Trump," *Newsweek*,
https://www.newsweek.com/canada-pm-mark-carney-europe-amid-donald-trump-clash-2045611)//Henry

New Canadian Prime Minister Mark [Carney]{.underline} [is making his
first foreign trip to Europe as tensions rise with U.S. President Donald
Trump over trade and Canadian sovereignty]{.underline}.

Carney will visit Paris and London to strengthen alliances and discuss
economic diversification, while steering clear of Washington for now.

Newsweek contacted the White House and Canada\'s Foreign Ministry for
comment via email on Sunday.

Why It Matters

[Carney\'s trip comes at a critical moment as Trump has imposed sweeping
25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods and openly suggested that Canada
should become the 51st U.S. state]{.underline}.

The [comments have infuriated Canadians and prompted boycotts of
American products, leading to a surge in the polls for Carney\'s Liberal
Party]{.underline}.

The prime minister\'s European visit aims to forge new trade agreements
and shore up alliances in response to Trump\'s economic moves.

What To Know

At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, [Carney underscored Canada\'s
distinct identity from its southern neighbor, saying]{.underline},
\"[Canada will never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the
United States]{.underline}.\" The 60-year-old former central banker, now
leading the Liberal Party, is [positioning himself as a leader ready to
stand up to Trump\'s aggressive policies and rhetoric.]{.underline}

Carney is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer, likely discussing strategies to
counterbalance U.S. tariffs. He will also meet with King Charles III,
Canada\'s head of state, marking a symbolic moment for the former Bank
of England governor.

[The trip also includes a stop at Canada\'s Arctic, reinforcing
Ottawa\'s commitment to Arctic sovereignty amid growing geopolitical
tensions.]{.underline}

[Although Carney has expressed a willingness to speak with
Trump]{.underline}, [he made it clear that such a conversation would
happen only if the U.S. president shows respect for Canadian
sovereignty]{.underline}. [The new prime minister said he has no
immediate plans to visit Washington]{.underline}, though he hopes to
arrange a phone call with Trump soon, The Associated Press reported.

Meanwhile, Carney\'s government is reviewing its planned purchase of
U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, potentially reconsidering the deal in light
of the ongoing trade conflict.

Trump and his allies\' repeated calls for Canada to become part of the
U.S. have not been well received in Canada, polls show.

A January YouGov poll among 1,030 Canadian adults and 1,091 U.S. adult
citizens found that the vast majority of Canadians, as well as many
Americans, opposed the idea of Canada becoming the U.S. 51st state.

The survey, conducted among 1,091 U.S. adults and 1,030 Canadian adults,
found that 77 percent of Canadians opposed the proposition, while just
15 percent supported it. Eight percent were unsure.

Meanwhile, 42 percent of Americans opposed the idea, 36 percent
supported it, and 22 percent were unsure.

What People Are Saying

Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international
relations at the University of Toronto, said: \"There\'s no point in
going to Washington. As \[former Prime Minister Justin\] Trudeau\'s
treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to
humiliate his guests.\"

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University, said:
\"President Trump\'s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and
the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and
the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control
over this remote yet highly strategic region.\"

What Happens Next

With Trump\'s policies galvanizing Canadian voters, Carney and his
Liberal Party---once predicted to face a historic defeat---now see a
potential political boost.

Whether Carney\'s European diplomacy will help reshape Canada\'s trade
relationships and counteract Trump\'s pressure remains to be seen.

[**Forget the border**---**Carney's** **biggest** **security challenge**
is in the **high north**]{.underline}

[While tariffs have put a spotlight on the US--Canada
border,]{.underline} [the biggest security challenge that Carney will
have to deal with is]{.underline} instead hundreds of miles away in [the
Arctic]{.underline}.

[Climate change is melting sea ice, making the Arctic more
accessible]{.underline}, [opening new shipping routes, and creating new
opportunities for resource extraction]{.underline}. [Canada's relatively
undeveloped Arctic makes the region an "attractive, strategic, and
vulnerable destination]{.underline}," [for]{.underline} foreign
[adversaries]{.underline} [according to]{.underline} the [Canadian
Security Intelligence Services]{.underline}, [which notes that enemies
will]{.underline} likely [be]{.underline} interested in [investing in
infrastructure and resources to gain a foothold in Canada's high
north]{.underline}.

With an upcoming election, [Carney should make strengthening Canada's
Arctic security a priority]{.underline}. For his part, Poilievre pledged
a substantial increase in Canada's military presence in the Arctic if
the Conservatives are elected.

The Trudeau government announced last week an investment to build three
Northern Operational Support Hubs, acting as a presence for the Canadian
Armed Forces in the region. However, the development of these hubs will
take place over twenty years, far too long a timeframe to meet a real
and already present threat, and Carney would be well suited to expedite
this timeline.

[In aiming to boost Canada's Arctic security, Carney should look south.
Cooperation with the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [may seem fraught today]{.underline}, [but in the
long term it is essential for the security and stability of the North
American Arctic.]{.underline}

The two nations' continued close cooperation, alongside Finland, is
essential to the success of the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE
Pact), which aims to build Arctic and polar icebreakers while sharing
information and knowledge among the three nations.

Additionally, Carney should seek to clarify and advocate for Canada's
participation in Trump's plan for the Golden Dome missile defense
system. Canada's role in the Golden Dome has never been clear, but
Ottawa and Washington already work together via North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD), with both nations planning to install modern
over-the-horizon radar stations and seabed-based sensors in the Arctic
to better detect cruise or ballistic missiles. Carney should look beyond
advocating for just sensors and instead work to install interceptors to
knock down incoming threats. Doing so would require Canada to reverse
its 2005 decision against joining the US homeland Ballistic Missile
Defense System, a politically bold move for Carney, but one that would
enhance the security of the Arctic---and North America as a whole.

### 1AR \-\-- AI Defense

#### AGI [impossible]{.underline} -- massive roadblocks and physical limits.

**Naudé 21** \[Wim Naudé, Professor of Economics at Cork University
Business School, "Artificial intelligence: neither Utopian nor
apocalyptic impacts soon," 2021, *Economics of Innovation and New
Technology*, Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 1-23,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10438599.2020.1839173\]

5.2. [The singularity **can be cancelled**]{.underline}

A second point (which is related to the first) is that an [AGI is
**remote**]{.underline}, placing hopes and speculations about a
super-intelligence and Singularity in the realm of science fiction
rather than of fact. The core problem is that [scientists **cannot**
**replicate**]{.underline} the human brain or [human
intelligence]{.underline} and consciousness [because **they do
not**]{.underline} fully **[understand it]{.underline}** (Meese 2018).
Penrose (1989) has (controversially) argued that quantum physics may be
required to explain human consciousness. Koch (2012) provides a rigorous
criticism from the point of biology of those claiming the imminence of a
singularity or superintelligence, stating that they do not appreciate
the complexity of living systems. Dyson (2019) believes the future of
computing is analogue (the human nervous system operates in analogue)
and not digital. Allen and Greaves (2011) describe a 'complexity brake'
applying to the invention of a super-intelligence, which refers to the
fact that '[As we go deeper]{.underline} and deeper [in]{.underline} our
[understanding]{.underline} of [natural systems]{.underline},
[we]{.underline} typically find that we [require **more**]{.underline}
and more **[specialized knowledge]{.underline}** \[...\] although
developments in AI might ultimately end up being the route to the
singularity, again [the **complexity** **brake** slows]{.underline} our
rate of [progress]{.underline}, and pushes the singularity considerably
into the future '.

Even if the invention of a superintelligence may not be realized quite
soon, or a Singularity be reached, that an understanding of the
potential issues at stake, such as the quality of AI, its ethical basis
and the dangers that any arms races for AI superiority may result in, is
necessary to inform current discussions around the regulation and
governance of AI. Because of the Fallacy of the Giant Cheesecake pursuit
of an AGI can lead to an AGI arms race. Certainly, if key players
(governments and big corporations) believe that through increased
compute narrow AI will eventually lead to an AGI, then such arms races
will spill over into the present arms races in AI. These can lead to
suboptimal outcomes which, as Naudé and Dimitri (2020) shows, will need
government regulation, taxation and incentivizing to minimize.

5.3. More difficult than it seems

A third point for discussion is the extent to which narrow AI has been
taken up and implemented -- and what it will take to realize the
general-purpose technology potential of AI. Section 3 illustrated that
the requirements for businesses to utilize or implement AI are
non-trivial. To be precise, [current AI R&D]{.underline} and business
generation [is **difficult** and **expensive**]{.underline}43 (Bergstein
2019; Farboodi et al. 2019). Most AI research and implementation is done
by a minority of companies in a minority of countries: in fact, around
30 companies in three regions, North-America, the EU and China perform
the vast bulk of research, patenting, as well as receives the bulk (more
than 90 percent) of venture capital funding for AI (WIPO 2019).

[Smaller companies]{.underline}, which makes up the vast majority of
business firms, [are at a **disadvantage**, facing **huge barriers to
entry** in the form of]{.underline} gaining access to and analyzing of
**[data]{.underline}** (Farboodi et al. 2019).44 There seems little
prospect of excessive automation, which Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b, p.
3) speculate is a potential cause of the slowdown in productivity in the
West.

While AI is a technique that is more difficult than it seems to develop
and adopt, especially in small businesses, it also not clear to many
businesses that AI can add value to their business. For example, during
the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it was soon clear that despite potential, AI
yet had little to offer in practical terms to fight the pandemic, and
moreover required large and relevant data-sets that were not yet
available (Naudé 2020).

Finally, [developing AI models at scale will require]{.underline}
solving a difficult problem, namely developing [**'green AI'.** Machine
Learning]{.underline} (ML) at the time of writing [implied **significant
environmental cost.**]{.underline} Schwartz et al. (2019) determined for
instance that 'training a large, deep-learning model can generate the
same carbon footprint as the lifetime of five American cars, including
gas'.

5.4. The limits of deep learning

A fourth point, that is related to the previous point as well as to the
facts presented on the rather narrow concerns of AI (most AI abilities
are limited to machine vision, natural language processing, speech, and
business intelligence45) is that possibility that [the current AI-boom
**may** **not** **last**]{.underline} very **[long.]{.underline}**
Perhaps another [**AI winter is looming. Deep** **learning** appears to
be facing **decreasing** **returns**, and further progress]{.underline}
in AI [may require innovations in **hardware**]{.underline} (e.g. in
edge and quantum computing) (Hao 2019).

On whether another AI winter is looming the jury is still out, although
there are signs that the [**low hanging fruits** of deep
learning]{.underline} may **[have been reaped]{.underline}** (Hao 2019)
and that alternative approaches to AI may be needed in order to better
simulate human intelligence (Bellmund et al. 2018; Dyson 2019).
Fundamentally, [innovation may be getting harder as a result of the
**burden of knowledge**]{.underline} (Jones 2009). Sequeira, Gil, and
Afonso (2018) have shown that [**entropy** will limit]{.underline} the
extent of [technologically driven]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline} and provide estimates of when economic growth will
converge to a zero rate. Similarly, [Moore's Law is **not expected to
hold**]{.underline} for much longer (Waldrop 2016).

5.5. Message from the empirical evidence...so far

A fifth point is that [the impacts of AI]{.underline}, over the short
and medium term, on job losses, inequality and productivity [have been
**overestimated**]{.underline}. Early predictions were that AI would
lead to massive job losses, large increases in labour productivity, and
spiraling inequality. In the meantime, the experience of much advanced
economies has been the opposite. Unemployment is at historical lows and
productivity growth is stagnating 46; global inequality is down, and
where within-country income [inequality]{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline}, for example in Germany, this has been found to
[be due to **too** **slow**]{.underline}, rather than too fast
[technological innovation]{.underline}, with technology broadly measured
by Total Factor Productivity (TFP) (Naudé and Nagler 2018).

Empirical evidence, still relatively scant but accumulating, has found
little evidence of net job destruction as a result of automation in
advanced economies. Theoretical economic models have also developed to
reflect better with the nature of an automation technology that can both
complement and substitute for human labor: these have variously shown
that automation can affect tasks within jobs rather than jobs itself,
can increase labor demand through (for instance 're-institution' of
labor due to labor productivity and wages rising) and moreover that AI
progress can be consistent with low wage and productivity growth,
relatively high employment, but with economic stagnation, entropy, and a
decline in the quality of jobs (Sequeira, Gil, and Afonso 2018; Schiller
2019; Gries and Naudé 2020).

The empirical evidence is however subject to two shortcomings. First,
most studies have focused on advanced economies. The few studies from
emerging economies (e.g. World Bank (2016); Carbonero, Ernst, and Weber
(2018)) tend to suggest that the effects of automation may be worse. A
second shortcoming is that most studies do not measure the impact of AI
directly, but rather via various measures of 'automation' of tasks,
using various broader indicators such as industrial robots and
'automation costs' which may or may not be appropriate proxies. It seems
the assumption, still to be rigorously tested, is that AI is an
effective automation technology, or similar to previous automation
technologies. Given however the comments above on the slow diffusion of
AI, and the relatively slow penetration of AI to many emerging economies
outside of China, more research is needed to better understand AI as an
automation technology, and to understand the potential vulnerabilities
of emerging economies to AI.

5.6. A misinformation epidemic

A final point is that if one considers the nature of machine learning
(and deep learning), the relatively few firms and countries driving AI
innovation, and the somewhat limited basic core functionalities being
developed (mostly computer vision and language), as well as perhaps most
importantly the slow and expensive diffusion of ML outside the giant
tech companies, then the exaggeration or hype in the media about AI
becomes even more accentuated.

Schwartz (2018) describes the current media discourse about AI as
'unhinged' and quote Lipton that [the world is suffering an **'AI
misinformation epidemic '.**]{.underline} 47 Despite the lack of
evidence, and prospects, for mass replacement of jobs by automation, a
2018 Poll by the Pew Research Center48 found that 65 percent of
Americans still fear that their jobs will be taken over by robots and
computers within 50 years.

According to Brooks (2017), there are a number of reasons why this
misinformation and hype about the impacts of AI occur. Perhaps the two
most relevant for the present discussion are that (i) [people have a
tendency to **overestimate**]{.underline} the impact of a **[new
technology]{.underline}** over the short-term but to underestimate it
over the longer-term (Amara's Law) and (ii) [the]{.underline} slow rate
of [diffusion of a new]{.underline}, especially new digital [technology,
is **much** **slower**]{.underline} and evolutionary, rather than
revolutionary, [than]{.underline} most [people think.]{.underline}

Brooks (2017) explains this last point referring to the slow pace of
replacement of hardware and physical infrastructure, which limits the
extent to which a digital technology such as AI can spread, stating as
an example that 'many of the cars we are buying today, which are not
self-driving, and mostly are not software-enabled, will probably still
be on the road in the year 2040. This puts an inherent limit on how soon
all our cars will be self-driving '. It is not only [**sunk**
**investments** in hardware and physical capital]{.underline} that
[slows down]{.underline} the adoption and impact of [the
newest]{.underline} digital [technologies]{.underline}, but also the
likelihood that different computer hardware is needed to continue to
make progress in AI (see related to this the discussion on the slowing
down of progress in AI in Section 3). For instance, at the time of
writing machine learning use **[large]{.underline}** amounts of
**[parallel processing power]{.underline}**, which is mostly [delivered
through]{.underline} servers in [the cloud]{.underline}, as opposed to
capacity on a local smart phone or hardware. This [creates]{.underline}
what is called [the **von Neumann Bottleneck**]{.underline} which is the
problem that '[data need to be transferred **back and
forth**]{.underline} from one place to the other [over]{.underline}time
[a calculation]{.underline} takes place' (Zarkadis 2018). To overcome
the von Neumann Bottleneck, more investment and research may be needed
in the field of edge computing. According to Batra, Queirolo, and
Santhanam (2018) 'inference at the edge will become increasingly common
for applications where latency in the order of microseconds is mission
critical '.

cyberattacks. The conclusions we can draw from this are:

[**Nonstate actors** and **most states** lack the capability to launch

a degree of caution by criminals.

[There is **enough uncertainty** among potential attackers about the
**U**nited **S**tates' ability to **attribute**]{.underline} [that they
are]{.underline} [**unwilling to risk massive retaliation** in
response]{.underline} to a catastrophic attack. (They are perfectly
willing to take the risk of attribution for espionage and coercive cyber
actions.)

[No one has ever died from a cyberattack, and only a
handful]{.underline} of these attacks have [produced physical damage. A
cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and it is **intellectually lazy**
to equate them to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Using a tactical nuclear
weapon against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. [The shadow of **nuclear
war distorts discussion** of cyber warfare]{.underline}.

[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national
strategies and interests. Their **primary emphasis** is on]{.underline}
**[espionage]{.underline}** [and political]{.underline} [**coercion**.
The **U**nited **S**tates has **opponents** and is in **conflict** with
them, but they have **no interest** in launching **a catastrophic
cyberattack** since it would **certainly** produce **an equally
catastrophic retaliation**. Their goal is to stay below the
"use-of-force" threshold]{.underline} and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, [not start a war]{.underline}.

[This has implications]{.underline} for the discussion of [**inadvertent
escalation**, something that has also]{.underline} **[never
occurred]{.underline}**. The concern over escalation deserves a longer
discussion, as [there are both **technological** and **strategic**
**constraints** that shape and **limit risk in cyber operations**, and
**the absence of inadvertent escalation** suggests **a high degree of
control** for cyber capabilities by **advanced states**. Attackers,
particularly among the **U**nited **S**tates' major
**opponents**]{.underline} [for whom cyber is just one of the tools for
confrontation, seek to **avoid actions** that could **trigger
escalation**]{.underline}.

[The **U**nited **S**tates has two opponents (**China** and **Russia**)
who are capable of damaging cyberattacks.]{.underline} Russia has
demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid, [but neither
**Russia nor China** would be **well served** by a]{.underline} similar
[attack on the **U**nited **S**tates. **Iran**]{.underline} is improving
and [may reach the point where it could use cyberattacks]{.underline} to
cause major damage, [but it would **only** do so when it has **decided**
to **engage** in a]{.underline} [**major armed conflict** with the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Iran might attack targets outside
the United States and its allies with less risk and continues to
experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli critical infrastructure.
[**North Korea** has **not**]{.underline} yet [developed this kind of
capability]{.underline}.

One major failing of [catastrophe scenarios]{.underline} is that they
[**discount** the]{.underline} robustness and [**resilience** of modern
economies. These]{.underline} economies present multiple targets and
configurations; they [are **harder to damage** through cyberattack
**than they look**]{.underline}, given the growing (albeit incomplete)
attention to cybersecurity; and experience shows that [people
**compensate for damage** and **quickly** **repair**]{.underline} or
rebuild. This was one of the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic
Bombing Survey. Pre-war planning assumed that civilian morale and
production would crumple [under **aerial** **bombardment**]{.underline}.
In fact, the opposite occurred. [**Resistance hardened** and
**production was restored**]{.underline}.1
