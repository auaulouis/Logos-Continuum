**Permilovskiy 12**, Ph.D student of the Northern (Arctic) Federal
University, (Mikhail, The Axiological Approach to the Regulation of the
Right to a Favourable Environment, Arctic Review on Law and Politics,
vol. 3, 2/2012 pp. 162--185. ISSN 1891-6252)

Value of [[the Arctic as an Object]{.underline}]{.mark} Environment
However criticism of the axiological approach also takes place. It is
expressed in the opinion that there is no necessity in the construction
of such rights because it may lead to the social priorities' conflict.41
Argumentation that environment value consists in allotment the
possibility for future generations and nations to live in favourable
(healthy) environment don't speak well for the balance of this
institution with other values or rights.42 Further it is told that it is
unobvious whether the acceptance of these rights will lead to a better
environmental protection or not and this can be done just through the
better legal regulation.43 Certainly the conflict between the right to a
favourable environment and other rights and social interests may occur.
But speaking about no necessity in this institution's examination in
terms of value priority meaning, you should pay attention to the danger
carried by the existent level of environmental pollution which has a
tendency for expansion. Adding to this climate changes and natural
resources' exhaustion, environmental threat is certainly one of the most
serious modern problems. In the author's opinion, the favourable
environment is a condition for the correct and secure functioning of the
social relations' system not only in a single state but also in other
countries. Therefore while examining this institution in terms of value
approach; we may say that it plays a security role in realization of
other human rights and freedoms. Professor Nadezhda Chertova notes that
the ecological component is revealed more or less in every type of
rights.44 !e right to a favourable environment in varying degrees really
ensures the full realization of civil (private), social as well as
political, economic and cultural rights. A dangerous situation in the
Arctic speaks well for the allotment with a matter of priority of the
right to a favourable environment. !e experts suppose that in the Arctic
environmental degradation scale is becoming dangerous, breach and
destruction of natural eco-systems seriously damage the health of
indigenous people of the North and migrants,45 many of which are still
engaged in traditional way of life. !e examining of the materials of the
Federal infobase of social-hygienic monitoring has shown that the high
levels of water objects' pollution are observed in the Nenets and
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts, the Murmansk and Arkhangelsk
Regions.46 !e author considers that ecologically-unfavourable situation
in the Arctic zone may now obtain irreversible e\$ects because the
environment in the Arctic is unsustainable and practically cannot be
reconstructed. [[Exploration **of** the Arctic
demands]{.underline}]{.mark} a special [[ecological
attention]{.underline}]{.mark} [[because it influences climate and
weather formation]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Northern hemisphere a lot
and it possesses a unique naturally-ecological space. !e Russian Arctic
zone is characterized by: the local nature of the economic exploration
of the territories, the remoteness and the inaccessibility of transport,
the emergency vulnerability and slow reducibility of natural
ecosystems.47 A [[major oil and gas deposits are concealed in the Arctic
area.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, specialists note that oil-producing,
oil-refining and gas industry are huge environmental pollutants and
negatively affect chemical and physical influence on all natural
components: lands, subsoil, forests, atmospheric air, water bodies,
fauna, landscapes and ecosystems in whole.48 According to Vladimir
Komissarenko, in those subjects of the Russian Federation where
enterprises of the industry are concentrated, the ecological situation
is characterized as unfavourable and the environmental contamination
level is evaluated to be high.49 !e environmental threat concealed in
[[the Arctic's exploration dictates]{.underline}]{.mark} the necessity,
first of all, in its [[scientific study including]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only concerning [[searching and developing of natural resources but
also protecting of the Arctic and arctic states environment;
and]{.underline}]{.mark} secondly, in [[domestic and international
monitoring of the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the case of
obvious threat of violation or actual violation of environmental
legislation and effective international standards, all the activities on
the Arctic's exploration should be blocked till the danger or violation
are eliminated.

#### Violation---The aff Does Exploration "in" the Arctic but it is not "of" the Arctic

#### The affirmative expands BMD activities "in" the Arctic that are for the purpose of detecting and shooting down missiles that cross the Arctic---It does not act to explore or develop the Arctic itself---it merely uses the Arctic to find and shoot down missiles

#### Golden Dome radar "in" the Arctic tracks missile and space objects -- not the Arctic itself

The US Department of Defense (DoD) has tested its Long Range
Discrimination Radar ([[LRDR]{.underline}]{.mark}) at Clear Space Force
Station [[in Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} on 23 June 2025. During the
test, designated as Flight Test Other-26a (FTX-26a), the Missile Defense
Agency (MDA) launched a target over the Northern Pacific Ocean. The
projectile travelled more than 2,000km before entering the radar range
of the LRDR system. The radar detected, tracked, and reported data about
the missile target to the command-and-control battle management and
communications (C2BMC) network, statement from Lockheed Martin said. MDA
director Lt. Gen. Heath Collins said: "This was a key test in the
development of the LRDR system and its integration into the C2BMC
network. "LRDR [[will provide]{.underline}]{.mark} USNORTHCOM and the
United States Space Force with [[the ability to precisely track
ballistic missile threats as well as]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[space
objects]{.underline}]{.mark}, advancing our ability to deter adversaries
and bolster our homeland missile defence." The tasks performed by [[the
radar are key for the]{.underline}]{.mark} US \$175bn [[Golden Dome
programme]{.underline}]{.mark}, which aimed to deter and defend aerial
threats. [[This radar]{.underline}]{.mark} technology i[[s capable of
identifying missile threats originating from Russia or
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, Reuters said in its report. [[The radar
also]{.underline}]{.mark} demonstrated its capability to [[track
satellites, debris, and orbital threats.]{.underline}]{.mark} US
Northern Command Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. A.C. Roper said: "This
long‑range discrimination radar is designed to defend the homeland by
providing \[the\] unparalleled ability to search, track and discriminate
multiple objects simultaneously." The Golden Dome, which is anticipated
to be operational by January 2029, has encountered political hurdles and
uncertainties surrounding its funding due to its hefty price tag,
according to the news agency. In April 2025, the US Army and Lockheed
Martin completed the short-range production qualification test launch of
the precision strike missile from an M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket
System launcher.

The official title of the Outer Space Treaty ('OST') mentions both
exploration and use of outer space as the two 'activities of States'
which one has to take into account and which are therefore covered by
the Outer Space Treaty. The same pair of terms appears again in the
Preamble as well as further articles such as Article I and Article III
of the Treaty. Other articles and other space treaties either take up
only one of these two terms or use a general terms such as 'activities
in outer space' (Art. VI, OST) or generally deal with 'objects launched
into outer space' (Art. VII, Art. VIII, OST and the Registration
Convention) or 'space objects' (Liability Convention) or finally
'activities of States on the Moon and other celestial bodies' (Moon
Treaty). At first sight the distinction between exploration and use may
seem sufficiently clear. Indeed in connection with most space activities
there may be little doubt which of these two terms is applicable. First
doubts appear, however, because [[the Outer Space Treaty speaks of
exploration 'of outer space']{.mark}. [This]{.mark} [wording]{.mark}
could be interpreted to [mean that space must be the object of
exploration]{.mark}. The consequence would be that the great part of
[research]{.mark} which has to take place '[in space]{.mark}' in view of
the specific physical conditions there, but [which has as its object
specific materials]{.mark}, [would not be covered and might only be
considered as 'use' of space.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### It's a voting Issue for limiting the topic

#### The Affirmative massively expands the topic by conflating "in" with "of" and making any actions in the arctic topical. 

## Extensions

### Contextual "of the Arctic" means object

#### Exploration or development "of" the Arctic as an object requires focus on the Arctic itself as the subject of E & D

**Zamyatina 18**, Research Scientist at Moscow State University
(Nadezhda, Zamyatina N.Yu., Pilyasov A.N. The new theory of the Arctic
and Northern development: multi-scale interdisciplinary synthesis.
Arktika i Sever \[Arctic and North\], 2018, no. 31, pp. 4--21. DOI:

After the bright achievements of the Soviet development school in the
past 30 years, there was a long pause. A new theory of development,
adequate to the current realities of globalization, post-industrial
transformation, knowledge economy, multi-agent participation in this
process and the variety of ownership forms, has not yet been proposed.
In fact, modern [[development of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
North of Russia remains without a proper theoretical and methodological
apparatus. Research in this area [[is limited to particular topics
(e.g., resource availability, indigenous people, outflow of youth,
etc]{.underline}.]{.mark}), and the problem is not only in absence or
weakness of generalizing works, but also in the fundamental
impossibility of using foreign theories for the Arctic and northern
conditions because of the other development factors, social effects of
economic processes, as well as the private, fractional, non-conceptual
nature of most research done in the North and the Arctic Canada, the
United States and Northern Europe. For the first time, the task is to
form such a holistic theory for the North and the Arctic basing on the
fundamental zonal regularities. On the one hand, none of the foreign
countries is able to do this simply because of the smaller size of the
territory of the Arctic and the North and, consequently, the objectively
smaller scale of development and the lesser need for its
conceptualization: why should they to reinvent a revolutionary new
bicycle, if it is possible to manage a more comfortable simple
extrapolation of the mainstream concepts prevailing in the temperate
zone to the North and the Arctic? On the other hand, modern methodology,
theories and tools of foreign regional science (a complex of sciences
aimed at studying regional development, incl. economic, geographical,
sociological and other approaches and methods) are formed on the basis
of densely populated territories with a dense network of urban
settlements (mainly in Western Europe and North America). These
methodology does not consider the real development the extreme arctic
and northern zones. It turns out that Russia is simply doomed to
creativity in this area by the size of its northern and arctic areas and
the scale of the related problems of development and nature management.
The relevance of the research Over the past 25 years, a world-class
social science has undergone a methodological revolution. The focus of
researchers has radically shifted. Earlier attention was focused on the
external factors of systems (in the economy this was manifested in the
concept of exogenous economic growth, in sociology --- in attention to
the external environment, in demography --- in the concepts of
transitions that involve unified stages of development for all
communities, etc.). In 1980s90s, researchers turned to the study of
internal factors of systems. In the economy, this was indicated as a
transition to the endogenous theory of economic growth, in sociology ---
to the study of micro-level processes, in demography --- to the birth of
institutional demography and a departure from the theory of a single
stage demographic transition. There was an idea of the heterogeneity of
internal factors of social systems, which, in previous approaches, were
supposed to be homogeneous. This methodological revolution has captured
a wide range of social disciplines and the concepts and theories they
develop. It radically transformed the methodology and methods, strategy
and tactics of research. In economics, sociology, anthropology, history,
practically simultaneously a breakthrough occurred, as they say, "inside
the black box" of regional development. It is paradoxical, however, that
the theory of economic development of the North and the Arctic has not
undergone this transformation, and it retains by default the old
postulates that processes are viewed from the standpoint of exclusively
external influences: investments from the federal budget or investments
of transnational companies, aimed at building large infrastructure
facilities (megaprojects) and creating poles of growth. Arctic and
North. 2018. No. 31 6 This approach represents the economic development
as determined from above; its initiators and drivers are the forces
external to the territory (federal level), and the development itself is
seen as territorially homogeneous, indifferent to the specific place of
its deployment. The conceptual apparatus for studying the development
for objective reasons remained the same and almost had no changes since
1980s. This clearly confirms our analysis of one and a half thousand
works registered in the RINC system of the past 25 years, containing the
key words "development of the North and the Arctic": in the vast
majority of the territorial specifics of development have not been
considered; they are considered only as a reservoir of resources or
local features and the territory has not been considered. True, the
concept of a frontier continues to be developed abroad. Macro- and
micro-levels are traditionally studied through this approach. However,
due to the marginal position of the new development territories in
foreign countries (Alaska in the USA, Arctic territories for Canada,
Greenland in Denmark, Lapland in Scandinavia, etc.), the frontier theory
is still not a complete system . Thus, in Russia, a powerful but Soviet
theory that has "decayed" but is still in use, and abroad --- a more
modern theory, but a more private and narrower one. Meanwhile, in other
sciences, a methodological revolution took place, which requires a
fundamental revision of the studying object of the development theory.
In social sciences, the concept of territory becomes an important actor
of social, economic, and, first of all, innovative processes. Local
specificity and local processes lie in the basis of the concepts of
regional and local innovation systems, innovation environment, cluster
development, and modern innovative development. The world picture, based
on our empirical observations, suggests that an inadequate approach to
local specifics is unacceptable. At the moment, it seems impossible to
ignore the local context of social and economic development, incl. the
development of resources in the North and the Arctic. The super task is
to modernize the theory of development by incorporating modern
approaches in it, consisting the systemic unity of global and local
processes (the "glocal" principle). Only in this theory, in our opinion,
is be able to reach positions adequate to the contemporary level of
development of the world social science. It is important that this
methodological breakthrough cannot be accomplished in foreign sciences
and be perceived as "foreign best practices" by us. The theory of
economic development is traditionally the Russian sphere of research,
attention to which is due to the unprecedented scale of the development
of Siberia, the North and the Arctic, their immense importance in the
development of Russia. Simply because of objective reasons, neither the
Scandinavian North and the Arctic, nor Greenland, the Canadian Arctic,
or Alaska, can have a large-scale theory of development. The applied
relevance of the development of such a new theory is determined by the
multifaceted problems and contradictions that accompany the modern
development of resources and Arctic and North. 2018. No. 31 7 areas of
the North and the Arctic: the need to harmonize the interests of
indigenous small numbered peoples of the North and resource companies,
the development of "rejuvenation" mechanisms for old industrial and
monoprofile territories of the North and the Arctic, the new large
projects on the shelf and land with a lack of experience and
competencies, etc. Three sources or parts of the new development theory
A new theory of development for the North and the Arctic, requires
integration of the three main blocks of scientific research. The first
block is the Soviet school of religious studies. The second is the
science of the last two decades, carried out within the framework of the
foreign frontier school and a number of other study areas related to the
resource use. The third block combines areas of foreign and Russian
regional science. Most of them were developed without any attention to
the specifics of the Arctic territories, but still they can be a source
of valuable methodological and methodological provisions suitable for
the analysis of the Northern and Arctic territories and their
development. All three blocs have been developing almost independently,
and the task is to integrate them. Let us consider each block
separately. The first block. In Soviet times, the major areas in social
and economic research of the development of the North were: industrial
and transport development \[1, Slavin S.V.\]; settlement of deserted
territories \[2, Pokshishevsky V.V.\]; assessment of natural resources
and their territorial combinations \[3, Mints A.A., pp. 16-39\];
economic complexes in Siberia \[4, Bandman M.K., pp. 8- 114\]; complex
development of the North \[5, Vityazeva V.A., pp. 107-110\].
Subsequently, all of them were further developed and became the basis of
a holistic theory of economic development of the Northern territories of
the USSR, finally shaped in the 1970s. Joint efforts of specialists led
to a single theory of economic development of the North: its conceptual
apparatus and the idea of economic spatial systems as an object of
development were introduced to the scientific community. Dramatically
expanded methodological possibilities of scientific analysis made the
development an economic and geographical process, resulted in new
spatial structures and aimed at the reconstruction of the social and
economic space \[6, Kosmachev K.P., p. 8\]. A very constructive concept
was developed by P.K. Kosmachev. He understood the development as "deep"
and "wide" and worked out its variations in space and in time \[6,
Kosmachev K.P., pp. 9, 66\]. By the end of the 1980s, the apparatus of
the theory had been shaped by the efforts of Soviet development schools.
It consists of several large parts: types of development, stages (or
phases), degrees and cycles of development, routes and bases ---
elements of the territorial structure of development. The idea of cycles
of development has many interpretations: cycles as types of development
\[7, Zaitsev I. F.\]; historical and geographical cycles \[8, Dergachev
V.A., pp. 82-86\], resource cycles \[9, Mosunov V.P., Nikulnikov S.Yu.,
Sysoev A.A.; 10, Komar I.V.\], and others. Knowledge of territorial and
economic structures, providing high efficiency of the development
process, has become an important area of research of the Irkutsk school
\[11, Kosmachev K.P. et Arctic and North. 2018. No. 31 8 al., pp.
84-92\]. The key idea there was the concept of a supporting frame --- an
interconnected organically integral system of linear communications
(routes of development) and node or point objects (bases of
development). A new stage in the development theory of the Northern
territories was opened by radical economic reform in Russia --- the
change from planning and command to the market economy paradigm of the
development of the North. New themes came to dominate the social and
economic studies of the North: structural policies \[12\], the ratio of
the market and the public mechanisms in the development of Northern
territories \[13, Luzin G.P., Pavlov K.P.\], local markets \[14,
Pilyasov A.N.\], privatization, the social consequences of economic
reforms \[15, Navasartov S.M., pp. 48-52\], etc. In the 1990s and 2000s,
Russian scientists carried out a purposeful adaptation of foreign
experience in the Northern economy to the new realities of the Russian
North \[16-19, Pilyasov A.N.\]. In fact, they created a base for the
integration of Russian (Soviet) and foreign Northern studies. Here, it
is necessary to note three monographs ("Northern economy and radical
reform (American experience and Russian realities)"; "Russian North and
federalism: in search of new models" and "From paternalism to
partnership (construction of new relations of the peoples of the North
and the state)"). These books accumulated experience of the resource and
economic development of Alaska and partly North of Canada and applied it
to the Russian Northern territories. Among the specific features of the
Russian North, the authors mentioned: a much longer age of economic
development than it was in the other countries; more powerful industry,
the specifics of the transformation of the administrative --- command
economic model and its effects on the of development of the North. All
these issues explained the huge variety of versions of the Northern
economy in the Russian North. It is in these works of the second half of
the 1990s, for the first time, we saw the idea of the special phenomenon
of the Northern economy and its complete concept. In the Northern
economy, institutions are closely linked to natural resources and their
life cycle. Relatively young resource provinces required one
institutions, older ones --- the others and the oldest provinces --- the
third \[20, Kryukov V.A.\]. Nevertheless, there are some general laws of
resource management institutions. equal for all the regions of the
world. The generalization of more than one thousand Russian research
works on the development for the past 15-20 years (the e-library data
base; keywords: "economic development", "development of the North and
the Arctic") testifies to significant progress compared to the Soviet
time. The search for [[the key words]{.underline}]{.mark} "development
of territories and resources of the Arctic and the North",
"[[development of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and the North" [gave
more than a thousand]{.underline} names of published
[sources.]{.underline} Then, we carried out several rounds of
"cleaning":  all the literature [on the]{.underline} history of
development, settlement, development of the Arctic and North territories
was excluded: for the purposes of our study, a time period of the last
two decades is necessary; we needed source on new exploration of the
resources and spaces of the Arctic and the North of Russia. The

the development of the Arctic and North of Russia are beyond the scope
of this research project. This reduced the search result for several
hundred sources at once;  All repeated sources were also excluded. It
turned out to be several dozen;  Then the first two hundred sources
were examined in order to outline the main rubrics where the new
development was stratified. So, [[there were about 20 themes related to
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Subsequently, all the other hundreds
of sources were classified (sorted) by these themes. Simultaneously, the
sources with no spatial aspect, or got into our original database
accidentally, or did not allow us to clearly define the research topic
by name, were excluded. So, minus a few hundred;  The further selection
required the introduction of a few additional headings. It turned out to
be 26. As a result, we had almost fifty sources on the new Arctic

#### Exploration "of" the Arctic as an object refers to studying the environment for environmental protection and study of mineral resources

**Permilovskiy 12**, Ph.D student of the Northern (Arctic) Federal
University, (Mikhail, The Axiological Approach to the Regulation of the
Right to a Favourable Environment, Arctic Review on Law and Politics,
vol. 3, 2/2012 pp. 162--185. ISSN 1891-6252)

Value of [[the Arctic as an Object]{.underline}]{.mark} Environment
However criticism of the axiological approach also takes place. It is
expressed in the opinion that there is no necessity in the construction
of such rights because it may lead to the social priorities' conflict.41
Argumentation that environment value consists in allotment the
possibility for future generations and nations to live in favourable
(healthy) environment don't speak well for the balance of this
institution with other values or rights.42 Further it is told that it is
unobvious whether the acceptance of these rights will lead to a better
environmental protection or not and this can be done just through the
better legal regulation.43 Certainly the conflict between the right to a
favourable environment and other rights and social interests may occur.
But speaking about no necessity in this institution's examination in
terms of value priority meaning, you should pay attention to the danger
carried by the existent level of environmental pollution which has a
tendency for expansion. Adding to this climate changes and natural
resources' exhaustion, environmental threat is certainly one of the most
serious modern problems. In the author's opinion, the favourable
environment is a condition for the correct and secure functioning of the
social relations' system not only in a single state but also in other
countries. Therefore while examining this institution in terms of value
approach; we may say that it plays a security role in realization of
other human rights and freedoms. Professor Nadezhda Chertova notes that
the ecological component is revealed more or less in every type of
rights.44 !e right to a favourable environment in varying degrees really
ensures the full realization of civil (private), social as well as
political, economic and cultural rights. A dangerous situation in the
Arctic speaks well for the allotment with a matter of priority of the
right to a favourable environment. !e experts suppose that in the Arctic
environmental degradation scale is becoming dangerous, breach and
destruction of natural eco-systems seriously damage the health of
indigenous people of the North and migrants,45 many of which are still
engaged in traditional way of life. !e examining of the materials of the
Federal infobase of social-hygienic monitoring has shown that the high
levels of water objects' pollution are observed in the Nenets and
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts, the Murmansk and Arkhangelsk
Regions.46 !e author considers that ecologically-unfavourable situation
in the Arctic zone may now obtain irreversible e\$ects because the
environment in the Arctic is unsustainable and practically cannot be
reconstructed. [[Exploration **of** the Arctic
demands]{.underline}]{.mark} a special [[ecological
attention]{.underline}]{.mark} [[because it influences climate and
weather formation]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Northern hemisphere a lot
and it possesses a unique naturally-ecological space. !e Russian Arctic
zone is characterized by: the local nature of the economic exploration
of the territories, the remoteness and the inaccessibility of transport,
the emergency vulnerability and slow reducibility of natural
ecosystems.47 A [[major oil and gas deposits are concealed in the Arctic
area.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, specialists note that oil-producing,
oil-refining and gas industry are huge environmental pollutants and
negatively affect chemical and physical influence on all natural
components: lands, subsoil, forests, atmospheric air, water bodies,
fauna, landscapes and ecosystems in whole.48 According to Vladimir
Komissarenko, in those subjects of the Russian Federation where
enterprises of the industry are concentrated, the ecological situation
is characterized as unfavourable and the environmental contamination
level is evaluated to be high.49 !e environmental threat concealed in
[[the Arctic's exploration dictates]{.underline}]{.mark} the necessity,
first of all, in its [[scientific study including]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only concerning [[searching and developing of natural resources but
also protecting of the Arctic and arctic states environment;
and]{.underline}]{.mark} secondly, in [[domestic and international
monitoring of the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the case of
obvious threat of violation or actual violation of environmental
legislation and effective international standards, all the activities on
the Arctic's exploration should be blocked till the danger or violation
are eliminated.

#### Affs which treat the Arctic as an object focus on climate change and the Arctic environment and resource extraction from the Arctic

Works dedicated to Arctic scenarios so far have largely focused on
resource extraction, climate change, geopolitics, and economic and
social development as key factors shaping the Arctic's future. Our
chapter adds to this body of knowledge by giving more weight to the
dynamics of international politics and cooperation, including the
pressures for a green transition. In our analysis, [[we treat the Arctic
as an object of interest]{.underline}]{.mark} to global society and a
topic of growing importance in international affairs. Namely, we present
four scenarios that describe how the context for international
cooperation in the Arctic might change in the years leading to 2035. The
time frame chosen for our scenarios is the 15 years between 2021 and the
end of 2035. This is a time horizon that gives us enough space to
elaborate on plausible developments and capture the big picture for
international cooperation in the Arctic. At the same time, we can be
concrete enough as 15 years is a future which is not too far away, at
least in our perception. We believe that most of the trends that will
shape the Arctic in the coming 15 years are already in place. We have
identified a set of certain, already evolving trends which will
significantly influence international cooperation in the Arctic the next
15 years (2035) 1 International Cooperation in the Arctic 2035 -- The
Four Scenarios Andrey Mineev, Jan Dietz, Petter Nore, Roman Vakulchuk
and Anatoli Bourmistrov 2 Andrey Mineev et al. and beyond, although many
of the implications are difficult to untangle. They appear, indirectly
or directly, in the four scenarios we have elaborated. These trends form
the backdrop of our analysis and are valid across all scenarios: •
Non-Arctic actors will have a greater say in making rules for the Arctic
• Climate change will be a key driver • Pressure for a green transition
will mount • Technological development will continue to accelerate •
Arctic demography is a permanent concern • Russia will remain heavily
dependent on fossil fuel resources • China will strive to increase its
global power • Geopolitical tensions will remain high Having established
the predictable and even predetermined factors and trends, it is
important to outline the key uncertainties. These uncertainties define
the contrasts between the scenarios, and they therefore play out
differently in each story. [[We have identified two major
uncertainties]{.underline}]{.mark}: • [[Fragmented versus coordinated
response to climate change • Arctic lockdown versus Arctic resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The first relates to international
cooperation to combat climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given the
myriad of national, economic, and institutional actors with different
interests in the Arctic, the future response to climate change is
profoundly uncertain. Will there be a coordinated response and
established efficient international institutions to handle climate
issues for the best of the planet? Or, in contrast, will we move into a
future characterized by fragmented, anarchic responses undertaken by a
variety of actors? [[The second]{.underline}]{.mark} major uncertainty
concerns generally accepted public and political attitudes to [[Arctic
resources. Will resources be extracted to meet growing world demands for
energy and food? Or will they be subject to a formal or de facto
lockdown,]{.underline}]{.mark} implying that they will be highly
regulated and/ or preserved? There are too many factors which can
influence both sides, yet the outcome remains highly uncertain.

### Military use is not E & D

#### 

#### Military actions in the Arctic do not treat the Arctic as the object---Contextually Russian military expansion including missile defense in the Arctic uses the Arctic but are not for the arctic. They merely use the Arctic.

[[Russia's growing military capabilities **in,** but not **for**, the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} existing and
planned military and paramilitary capabilities in the Russian Arctic
indicate that the major [[goals of its security policy in the region are
ensuring its sovereign rights, protecting its borders and maritime
areas, and providing strategic deterrence. Military forces stationed in
the Arctic mainly appear to be part of Russia's broader security
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, of which nuclear deterrence is a key
component. Russia's modernized SSBN fleet is viewed as an essential
element of its nuclear deterrence forces. Under the State Rearmament
Programme the main groups of surface ships designated for modernization
are anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare ships, as well as coastal
defence ships to protect SSBNs stationed in the Arctic. [[Russia's
reinstatement of its airfields and radar stations in the Arctic has

### BMD Specific

#### Missile detection radar "in" the Arctic is designed to track missiles from Iran and Korea and track space objects not "of" the Arctic

**Judson 25**, Award-winning journalist covering land warfare for
Defense News (Jen, June 24, 2025, After years-long delay, missile
tracking radar test declared a success,
<https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/06/24/after-years-long-delay-missile-tracking-radar-test-declared-a-success/>)

After a delay of nearly two years, the Missile Defense Agency has
declared a successful test of its Long-Range Discrimination Radar's
ability to track a live ballistic missile target. In a June 23 test, the
[[LRDR at]{.underline}]{.mark} Clear Space Force Station,
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, "successfully acquired, tracked and
reported missile target data to the Command and Control Battle
Management and Communications (C2BMC)," according to a recent MDA
announcement. "This was the radar's first flight test tracking a live
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) representative target." The
target was air launched over the northern Pacific Ocean, according to
MDA, and flew over 2,0000 kilometers (roughly 1,243 miles) off the
southern coast of Alaska. Tracking data from LRDR as well as the
Upgraded Early Warning Radar, also at Clear Space Force Station, was
sent to the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system as part of the
simulated engagement, the agency said. The key test was rescheduled
after the original was halted in 2023 due to a "target anomaly," Missile
Defense Agency Director Lt. Gen. Heath Collins told Defense News in an
August 2024 interview. "We did do a track \[exercise\] the next month
with another target that was ... not as complicated a target set and it
worked very well," he said. The agency's biggest concern was to get the
radar into operations faster following a series of other delays ---
including the coronavirus pandemic --- leading up to its initial
fielding in December 2021. MDA had to stop all construction and
integration activities for LRDR when the coronavirus began spreading in
the U.S. in March 2020. The program went into "caretaker status,"
meaning just a small group stayed at the site to ensure the materials
were protected from the elements. The successful test will now inform a
decision to add it into the operational baseline for ballistic missile
defense of the homeland. Formal operational acceptance of the LRDR by
the U.S. Space Force was planned to occur by the end of 2023 prior to
the canceled 2023 test event. Once fully operational, the Lockheed
Martin-developed [[LRDR will be able to]{.underline}]{.mark}
simultaneously search and [[track]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple [[small
objects, including]{.underline}]{.mark} all classes of [[ballistic
missiles at long ranges]{.underline}]{.mark} under continuous operation
and will be tied into the GMD system and the C2BMC system. The GMD
architecture is designed to protect the continental U.S. from
intercontinental ballistic missile threats [[from North Korea and
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond missile defense, [[LRDR will also
support space domain awareness by monitoring space activity like
satellites orbiting the earth]{.underline}]{.mark}, spent rocket bodies
[[and fragmentation debris]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while not an
official requirement, a software upgrade could give LRDR hypersonic
weapon detection and tracking capability.

#### The radar can detect missiles outside of the Arctic launched from China, Iran or Korea.

**Stone 25**, is a Reuters reporter (Mike, June 24, 25, US tests radar
that could link into Golden Dome to detect China, Russia threats,
<https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-tests-radar-that-could-link-into-golden-dome-detect-china-russia-threats-2025-06-24/>)

The Pentagon has successfully tested a [[long-range radar in
Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} that c[[an detect missile threats from
Russia or China, and could someday serve as a sensor in the Golden Dome
missile defense shield.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Long Range
Discrimination Radar successfully acquired, tracked, and reported
missile target data, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. These are key tasks
for Golden Dome, a \$175 billion program aimed at protecting the U.S.
and possibly allies from ballistic missiles. The U.S. Defense
Department\'s [[long-range radar in Central Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}
was built by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab as part of the
existing Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile defense system. The
system is designed to increase the effectiveness of interceptors based
in Alaska and California that are currently on standby to [[knock down
incoming missiles launched by Iran or North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Placing missile defense "in" the Arctic is about creating the ability to detect launches from far outside of the Arctic because of the curvature of the Earth

**Lee & Poling 23**,Senior Fellow, and Research Analyst for Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies (Caitlin & Aidan, Bolstering Arctic
Domain Awareness to Deter Air & Missile Threats to the Homeland,
<https://www.mitchellaerospacepower.org/app/uploads/2023/06/41-Bolstering-Arctic-Domain-Awareness-FINAL.pdf>)

What steps can the United States take to bolster deterrence in the
Arctic region, and what are some specific capabilities needed to take
those steps? To build NORAD/ NORTHCOM's focus on improving domain
awareness and information dominance, the [[United
States]{.underline}]{.mark} should develop a
[[layered,]{.underline}]{.mark} overlapping set of [[missile defeat
capabilities for the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the
United States Government now recognizes air and cruise missile defense
in the Arctic as a serious problem, strategy and resources are not yet
fully aligned to reflect the magnitude of the threat, and the timeline
for resources that are allocated to address the challenge is too drawn
out. There are several capabilities that are already available or could
be rapidly fielded to contribute to a more effective Arctic missile
defeat strategy in the short term. These capabilities can be part of a
missile defeat strategy that supports NORAD/NORTHCOM's focus on
providing decision-quality information to U.S. leaders that will help
expand options available to deter missile attacks before they occur. [[A
Layered Approach to Missile Defeat]{.mark}]{.underline} Gen VanHerck has
called for a layered air and cruise missile defense approach, which
involves working with other U.S. combatant commands as well as allies
and partners. This approach [[is focused on sensing emerging missile
threats as far left of launch as possible,]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly
communicating necessary information about threats, and determining
resources available to deal with it as quickly as possible.78 The key to
achieving these operational objectives will be to mitigate existing
domain awareness and information gaps with networks of integrated
sensors, including airborne platforms such as autonomous uninhabited
aircraft, ground radars, and surface and undersea sensing capabilities.
In terms of right of launch capabilities, Gen VanHerck envisions
creating more non-kinetic options to counter air and cruise missiles
such as electromagnetic spectrum systems and cyber tools.79 Overall, Gen
VanHerck has said NORAD/ NORTHCOM's missile defeat architecture, known
as Homeland Defense Design 2035, will be "vastly different from the way
we do it today with fighters, tankers, AWACS and those kinds of
things."80 DOD is already investing in certain components of air and
missile defense that will improve NORAD/NORTHCOM's ability to detect,
track, attribute, and counter hostile air threats in the Arctic and
across its full area of responsibility. But funding for the effort is
not coordinated under one portfolio or a strategy for air and cruise
missile defense of the homeland. Furthermore, timelines for fielding new
systems are too drawn out to address threats in the Arctic today. For
instance, NORAD/NORTHCOM's first new [[over-the horizon
radars]{.underline}]{.mark}, which c[[an achieve very long range
detection of threats by bouncing longrange radar beams off the
atmosphere and over the curvature of the earth,]{.underline}]{.mark}
will not become fully operational until 2031. As DOD's cruise missile
defense acquisition authority, the Air Force is responsible for funding
four OTHRs for NORAD/NORTHCOM. Meanwhile, Canada plans to invest
billions in Arctic OTHR, Polar OTHR, and Crossbow, a classified sensing
program.81 And while DOD is mulling plans to modernize the North Warning
System ground-based radars, no final decision has been made.82 The point
is, none of these efforts will be completed until 2030 or later.83

#### Location "in" the arctic is to detect the launch of missiles within Russia or China not from the Arctic

**GSDN 25,** Global Defense Network News, (March 28, 25, Greenland, The
Island Of Interest. Trump's Obsession, Putin's Warning, And The Fight To
Keep The US At Bay,
https://gsdn.live/greenland-the-island-of-interest-trumps-obsession-putins-warning-and-the-fight-to-keep-the-us-at-bay/)

[Pituffik]{.underline} plays a key role in missile defense and space
surveillance. The base is home to an Upgraded [Early Warning Radar
system that can detect missile launches in their earliest
moments]{.underline}, providing critical data for US defense operations.
[The ability to detect a launch, calculate trajectory, and activate
missile defense systems]{.underline} makes Pituffik an irreplaceable
component of the US military's global defense strategy.

### AT: We increase domain awareness

#### "Domain Awareness" in the context of missile defense means awareness of missile launches over the Arctic not exploration or development "of" the Arctic itself

**Lee & Poling 23**,Senior Fellow, and Research Analyst for Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies (Caitlin & Aidan, Bolstering Arctic
Domain Awareness to Deter Air & Missile Threats to the Homeland,
<https://www.mitchellaerospacepower.org/app/uploads/2023/06/41-Bolstering-Arctic-Domain-Awareness-FINAL.pdf>)

NORAD, which has more than half its area of responsibility focused on
the [[Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly channels its missile defeat
efforts into detecting threats as early and proactively as possible. To
this end, NORAD/U.S. Northern Command, have made "all [[domain
awareness"]{.mark}]{.underline} a top priority. [[As applied to air and
missile threats, the term describes]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[efforts
to enable]{.underline}]{.mark} "indications and [[warnings through
detection, tracking, identification, characterization, warning and
attribution."]{.underline}]{.mark}10 The goal of this "left-of-launch"
approach is to expand decision space for senior U.S. leaders so they are
not left with only highly escalatory response options, such as
preemptive or retaliatory strikes.11 Gen VanHerck describes the ability
to give U.S. decisionmakers the information needed to expand their
options as "information dominance" and argues that increased domain
awareness, when combined with information dominance, will lead to
enhanced deterrence.12

### "In" would be different

#### In is a preposition of place---It means an action that takes place in the Arctic

**Routh 25,** MA in Education and English Content Writer for Quilbot,
(Nicole, Prepositions of Place \| List, Examples & Exercises,
<https://quillbot.com/blog/sentence-and-word-structure/prepositions-of-place/>)

[[A preposition of place]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
"[[in,]{.underline}]{.mark}" "on," or "at") begins a prepositional
phrase that describes a location (e.g., "under the sofa"). The
prepositional phrase [[shows where a noun or action]{.underline}]{.mark}
from another part of the sentence [[is located in relation to the object
of the preposition]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., "The sock was under the
sofa"). The location can be physical (e.g., "in Paris" or "on the
table") or abstract (e.g., "on the radio" or "in the TikTok video").

#### The Choice of "of" vs "in" is an important difference

**9^th^ Circuit Court of Appeals 9 (**Doe 1 v. AOL LLC, 552 F.3d 1077
(9th Cir. 2009).
https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1075638.html)

The district court, without discussion, interpreted the forum selection
clause to refer to state and federal courts of Virginia. We determine
the meaning of the phrase \"courts of Virginia\" de novo, Hunt Wesson
Foods, Inc., 817 F.2d at 77, and look first to its plain meaning. We
have not previously addressed the meaning of a forum selection clause
designating the courts \"of,\" rather than \"in,\" a state. We hold that
the forum selection clause at issue here --- designating the courts of
Virginia --- means the state courts of Virginia 1082\*1082 only; it does
not also refer to federal courts in Virginia.

[[The clause\'s use of]{.mark} the preposition [\"of\"]{.mark} ---
[rather than \"in\" --- is **determinative**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Black\'s Law]{.underline}]{.mark} Dictionary [[defines \"of\" as a
term \"denoting that from which anything proceeds; indicating origin,
source]{.mark}, descent, and the like\....\"\[]{.underline}8\] Black\'s
Law Dictionary 1080 (6th ed.1990). Thus, [[courts \"of\" Virginia refers
to courts]{.mark} proceeding from, [with their origin in,
Virginia]{.mark} --- [i.e.,]{.mark} the [state courts of
Virginia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Federal district courts, in contrast,
proceed from, and find their origin in, the federal
government.\[9\]]{.underline}

[Our interpretation finds support among opinions by our sister
circuits]{.underline} who have addressed the meaning of forum selection
clauses designating the \"courts of\" a state --- all of whom have
interpreted such clauses to refer to the state courts of the designated
state, and not also to the federal courts in the designated state. See
Am. Soda, LLP v. U.S. Filter Wastewater Group, Inc., 428 F.3d 921, 926
(10th Cir. 2005) (interpreting \"Courts of the State of Colorado\" to
mean Colorado state courts; the clause \"refers to sovereignty rather
than geography\"); Dixon v. TSE Int\'l Inc., 330 F.3d 396, 398 (5th
Cir.2003) (interpreting \"Courts of Texas, U.S.A.\" to mean Texas state
courts; \"\[f\]ederal district courts may be in Texas, but they are not
of Texas\"); LFC Lessors, Inc. v. Pac. Sewer Maint. Corp., 739 F.2d 4, 7
(1st Cir.1984) (interpreting forum selection and choice of law clause
stating the contract shall be interpreted according to \"the law, and in
the courts, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\" to designate the
state courts of Massachusetts; \"the word \`of\' as it appears in the
phrase in question must have been intended to restrict the meaning of
both \`law\' and \`courts\' to those that trace their origin to the
state.\").

Accordingly, we hold the plain meaning of the forum selection clause\'s
designation of the \"courts of Virginia\" is the state courts of
Virginia; it does not include federal district courts located in
Virginia.\[10\]

## Aff Answers

#### We meet both exploration and development---We study the arctic to figure out the best places to put radar and we expand infrastructure in the arctic.

#### The aff increases exploration and development because maintaining and constructing infrastructure requires increasing knowledge of the Arctic and developing infrastructure

Risk: [[U.S. Arctic infrastructure is poorly suited for Missile
Defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}. Operating both ground and air-based assets
in the Arctic is logistically challenging. The lack of airbases with
sufficient runways, weapons, and fuel storage are significant problems
for aircraft operations in the region.73 The remote and harsh nature of
the high north poses unique challenges to personnel, machinery, and
infrastructure---temperatures frequently reach below -40 Celsius.
[[Shifting permafrost makes]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[the construction
and maintenance of buildings a difficult and constant
battle]{.underline}]{.mark} against the elements. Even [[maintaining the
existing North Warning System's remotely operated ground-based radar
stations]{.underline}]{.mark} is challenging and [[requires
dedicated]{.underline}]{.mark} support and transportation
[[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} given the vast distances and
remoteness involved.74

[[The Arctic is the preeminent staging ground for adversary missile
attacks because it is the most direct route from Moscow or
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} to Washington DC, and both Russia and China
are subsequently taking steps to increase their foothold in the Arctic.
[[The size of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the potential for
large, unpredictable missile raids, [[creates a need
for]{.underline}]{.mark} new "left-of-launch" capabilities, such as
[[increased domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}, to give U.S. leaders
more options in a crisis. The Department of Defense (DOD) should launch
a joint capability technology demonstration to identify promising Arctic
missile defeat efforts. DOD and Congress should establish [[a North
American Defense Initiative]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[fund Arctic domain
awareness and infrastructure upgrades]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Air
Force should exploit existing weapon systems including Air National
Guard MQ-9 Reapers and accelerate [[procurement of new systems to

continue collaboration with the commercial space sector to enhance
Arctic communications and reconnaissance.

#### Missile defense in the Arctic is key to domain awareness "of" the Arctic

[[Domain Awareness Gaps in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} The January
2023 intrusion of a Chinese spy balloon into U.S. airspace by way of
northwest Canada caught the nation off-guard and highlighted the
[[severe lack of U.S. domain awareness in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. When asked by Senator Angus King during a
March 2023 Senate hearing whether [[the lack of indications and warning
in the Arctic presents an "Arctic gap" in U.S. national
security,]{.mark}]{.underline} Gen VanHerck responded that "we are not
organized, trained or equipped to respond in the Arctic."62
[[An]{.underline}]{.mark}other [[Arctic expert described the region as
"a dark area on the map"]{.underline}]{.mark} because it is so vast and
so few civilian surveillance resources cover it.63 [[The lack of domain
awareness prevents the United States from obtaining the early warning
and intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) [[information necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} to anticipate and
take actions [[to deter air and cruise missile
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}s. This domain awareness gap would become
acute in the event of an actual cruise missile launch. Without the
ability to identify and track incoming threats, U.S. forces would be
poorly positioned to scramble fighters, activate air defenses, and
execute other kinetic and non-kinetic defensive actions in response.
Risk: The North Warning System is a "picket fence." Today, the
centerpiece of Arctic domain awareness for North American air and cruise
missile defense is the aging North Warning System, a network of 47 radar
stations that monitor the airspace over the Canadian Arctic and Alaska.
The North Warning System was established in 1985 as a joint project
between Canada and the United States, replacing the outdated Distant
Early Warning (DEW) Line that was built in the 1950s. The North Warning
System itself is increasingly outdated since it continues to rely on
technology first developed in the 1970s.64 This system is only designed
to identify approaching Soviet or Russian bombers that have already
launched and are flying within the range of its radar; it cannot provide
early indications and warning of adversary force posture changes in the
Arctic that could be a prelude to an attack.65 The NWS also lacks the
ability to detect air and missile threats launched from inside Russia,
and it cannot detect incoming bombers, cruise missiles, drones, and
other threats that are simply flying too low to be detected or are
operating too far beyond the range of its radar.66 As Russia and China
develop stealthier cruise missiles and diversify their cruise missile
launch options, whether through different air approaches, land-based
attacks, or surface and sub-surface attacks, the gaps in the North
Warning System's effective radar coverage will continue to increase.
"Imagine a solid fence shrinking to a picket fence," Gen VanHerck,
explains. "And now you have cruise missiles that can get through your
capability to detect."67 Risk: [[U.S. Arctic airborne surveillance
assets are scarce]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are two general ways that
airborne [[assets could improve Arctic domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, inhabited and uninhabited ISR
aircraft routinely operating in the northern tier could provide early
indications and warning of threat activity on the ground, in the air and
above and below the water's surface. Second, airborne early warning and
control aircraft---namely the Air Force's E-3B/G AWACS---can detect
incoming hostile air and cruise missile threats, providing battle
management capabilities to coordinate fighters or other defensive assets
against missile targets. The problem is that these assets are scarce and
are not assigned or routinely allocated to Northern Command or NORAD.
The situation is particularly dire for the Air Force's E-3 AWACs: this
small fleet of around 30 aging aircraft suffers from mission capable
rates below 60 percent and is in constant demand in the Indo-Pacific and
European theaters.68 This gap will continue until E-7 Wedgetail
replacement aircraft come online in the late 2020s. Even then, total
inventory numbers will be limited.

#### Expanded missile defense increases domain awareness of the Arctic and deters attacks

The U.S. Department of Defense continues to invest billions to defend
against limited ballistic missile attacks, but [[the U.S. military's
ability to detect, track, and defeat a cruise missile strike emanating
from the Arctic has degraded significantly over the past 30
years]{.underline}]{.mark}. [China or Russia could exploit this
shortfall using conventional cruise missile attacks]{.mark} to deal a
quick blow that keeps U.S. military forces at distance and avoid a
nuclear response. [[Bolstering deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} against
conventional air and cruise missile [[threats in the Arctic starts by
improving U.S.,]{.underline}]{.mark} ally, and partner [[domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} and information dominance capabilities.
[[Adversaries will be disinclined to launch strikes on the U.S. homeland
if they know the United States is anticipating the attack and creating
options to dissuade it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Achieving better domain
awareness involves efforts to provide indications and warning of attacks
through the detection, tracking, characterization, warning, and
attribution of]{.underline}]{.mark} modern
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 Establishing information dominance
enables U.S. leaders to access decision-quality information more quickly
than adversaries. [[Domain awareness and information dominance can
underwrite a]{.underline}]{.mark} comprehensive "missile defeat"
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}, left and right of launch, [[that gives
U.S. leaders more options to deter an attack on the U.S.
homeland]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### We meet development\--Missile defense is development of missile defense capabilities that increase domain awareness and Arctic development is key to deterrence

**Lee & Poling 23**,Senior Fellow, and Research Analyst for Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies (Caitlin & Aidan, Bolstering Arctic
Domain Awareness to Deter Air & Missile Threats to the Homeland,
<https://www.mitchellaerospacepower.org/app/uploads/2023/06/41-Bolstering-Arctic-Domain-Awareness-FINAL.pdf>)

What steps can the United States take [[to bolster deterrence in the
Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}, and what are some specific
capabilities needed to take those steps? To build NORAD/ NORTHCOM's
[[focus on improving domain awareness and information dominance, the
United States should **develop** a layered, overlapping set of missile
defeat capabilities for the Arctic region.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although
the United States Government now recognizes air and cruise missile
defense in the Arctic as a serious problem, strategy and [[resources are
not yet fully aligned to reflect the magnitude of the
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the timeline for resources that are
allocated to address the challenge is too drawn out. There are several
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} that are already available or
[[could be rapidly fielded to contribute to a more effective Arctic
missile defeat strategy in the short term]{.underline}]{.mark}. These
capabilities can be part of a missile defeat strategy that supports
NORAD/NORTHCOM's focus on providing decision-quality information to U.S.
leaders that will help expand options available to deter missile attacks
before they occur. A Layered Approach to Missile Defeat Gen VanHerck has
called for a layered air and cruise missile defense approach, which
involves working with other U.S. combatant commands as well as allies
and partners. This approach is focused on sensing emerging missile
threats as far left of launch as possible, rapidly communicating
necessary information about threats, and determining resources available
to deal with it as quickly as possible.78 The [[key]{.underline}]{.mark}
to achieving these operational objectives [[will be to mitigate existing
domain awareness and information gaps with networks of integrated
sensors, including]{.underline}]{.mark} airborne platforms such as
autonomous uninhabited aircraft, ground radars, and [[surface and
undersea sensing capabilities.]{.underline}]{.mark} In terms of right of
launch capabilities, Gen VanHerck envisions creating more non-kinetic
options to counter air and cruise missiles such as electromagnetic
spectrum systems and cyber tools.79 Overall, Gen VanHerck has said
NORAD/ NORTHCOM's missile defeat architecture, known as Homeland Defense
Design 2035, will be "vastly different from the way we do it today with
fighters, tankers, AWACS and those kinds of things."80 DOD is already
investing in certain components of air and missile defense that will
improve NORAD/NORTHCOM's ability to detect, track, attribute, and
counter hostile air threats in the Arctic and across its full area of
responsibility. But funding for the effort is not coordinated under one
portfolio or a strategy for air and cruise missile defense of the
homeland. Furthermore, timelines for fielding new systems are too drawn
out to address threats in the Arctic today. For instance,
NORAD/NORTHCOM's first new over-the horizon radars, which can achieve
very long range detection of threats by bouncing longrange radar beams
off the atmosphere and over the curvature of the earth, will not become
fully operational until 2031. As DOD's cruise missile defense
acquisition authority, the Air Force is responsible for funding four
OTHRs for NORAD/NORTHCOM. Meanwhile, Canada plans to invest billions in
Arctic OTHR, Polar OTHR, and Crossbow, a classified sensing program.81
And while DOD is mulling plans to modernize the North Warning System
ground-based radars, no final decision has been made.82 The point is,
none of these efforts will be completed until 2030 or later.83

#### We meet Exploration and Development---Increasing Arctic missile defense involves research on the Arctic for domain awareness and physical development and expansion of bases

**Lee & Poling 23**,Senior Fellow, and Research Analyst for Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies (Caitlin & Aidan, Bolstering Arctic
Domain Awareness to Deter Air & Missile Threats to the Homeland,
<https://www.mitchellaerospacepower.org/app/uploads/2023/06/41-Bolstering-Arctic-Domain-Awareness-FINAL.pdf>)

Concepts for improving cruise missile defense of the homeland are still
developing, but to date they have largely focused on improving point air
and missile defenses for geographically discrete, high-value areas like
the National Capital Region, Guam, and Hawaii. These efforts have
intrinsic value for protecting critical U.S. infrastructure and
power-projection nodes, but they are no substitute for addressing
serious air and cruise missile defeat in the high north. [[Given the
geopolitical importance of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} as a staging
ground for offensive missile attacks [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
well-known [[domain awareness gaps that exist there, domain awareness
and information dominance in this region should be a top priority for
air and cruise missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark} of the homeland. In
some ways, [[Arctic missile defeat challenges are unique.
The]{.underline}]{.mark} very cold [[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} and
geographic proximity to adversaries [[make it a complex operating
environment.]{.underline}]{.mark} There are also some requirements for
missile defeat in the Arctic that reflect the same challenges facing the
contiguous United States: namely, the need to improve domain awareness
across a very large area to protect against the potential for
adversaries to adopt multiple vectors of attack, severely degrading the
U.S. ability to detect and track threats. Just as Guam and Hawaii serve
as proving grounds for missile defense strategies for discrete areas,
Alaska can serve as a testbed for missile defeat strategies that
emphasize indications and warning over a broad swath of territory. [[To
operationalize a missile defeat strategy in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the DOD]{.underline}]{.mark} and Congress
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} launch a joint capability technology
demonstration (JCTD) to [[test different sensor network
combinations]{.underline}]{.mark} and software tools [[aimed at
increasing domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} and information
dominance. After acquisition responsibility for cruise missile defense
of the homeland moved from the Missile Defense Agency to the U.S. Air
Force, a previous JCTD to examine a layered approach to cruise missile
defense was scaled down to focus on the National Capital Region.
Congress and [[DOD should fund]{.underline}]{.mark} a broader JCTD to
experiment with air, space, [[surface, and subsurface capabilities that
could provide an overlapping, layered cruise missile defense for the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. For DOD & Congress: Create a Dedicated Fund
to Bolster Deterrence in the Arctic The DOD and Congress should consider
creating a North American Deterrence Initiative. [[The initiative would
focus on increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} investments for cruise missile
defeat and bolstering physical [[military presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. For missile defeat, investments would
target left-of-launch capabilities. [[Investing in domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} and decision dominance [[would be central
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}; getting left of launch may help to
reduce the overall costs of an approach focused solely or heavily on
traditional missile defense. The Congressional Budget Office assessed
that a comprehensive missile defense strategy for the contiguous United
States would cost between \$75 billion and \$465 billion, while the
Center for Strategic and International Studies proposed an architecture
that would cost nearly \$33 billion.95 However, these architectures
include relatively robust funding for right of launch defensive
capabilities. A posture that emphasizes left-of-launch capabilities in
the Arctic might ultimately bolster deterrence and result in cost
savings. The second focus of the new fund should be [[physical
infrastructure improvements]{.underline}]{.mark}. These w[[ould include
building pre-positioned, hardened shelters to store aircraft
equipment,]{.underline}]{.mark} spares and other logistics needs, [[and
the modernization of Pituffik Space Base, DOD's northernmost base, which
is in need of significant investment and improvements to withstand harsh
environmental conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Expanding the U.S.
military's physical presence in the Arctic is key to bolstering
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. Decisions on where to
invest in Arctic domain awareness would be based on two criteria: 1) DOD
analysis to determine trades between [[enhancing Arctic domain
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} versus various right of launch cruise
missile defense options for key infrastructure nodes in the contiguous
United States, and 2) Lessons learned from the Arctic cruise missile
defeat JCTD proposed above.

Capabilities

Budget constraints, however, will prevent large-scale acquisition of
military equipment designed for the Arctic. There are just too many
competing demands on the defense budget. A handful of modern icebreakers
and limited numbers of the Army's new cold-weather vehicle may be the
extent of new, manned Arctic capabilities funded for the foreseeable
future. That said, the United States could shift cold-weather-capable
equipment to the region, especially unmanned intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance platforms. Unmanned capabilities need not have been
developed for the Arctic per se but could be adapted for use in the
region.

[There is a role for the U.S. private sector in [**developing** Arctic
capabilities and **infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline} [if given the
right government **inducements**]{.underline}. [[One promising area is
satellite communication]{.underline}]{.mark} and positioning systems.
Satellite [companies are potentially attractive government partners.
[The U.S. military is looking]{.mark} into private-sector [efforts such
as the OneWeb and Starlink polar communication
satellites]{.mark}]{.underline}. The European Space Agency is doing the
same with Arctic weather satellites. There is no reason these
initiatives could not be expanded.

[The Biden administration's **Arctic** strategy should consider the role
of extractive industries]{.underline} ([oil, mining, timber, fishing) in
the region]{.underline}. [Those industries have built much of the
nonmilitary infrastructure in Alaska. In the future, as the global
economy shifts from hydrocarbons to green energy, government efforts to
foster **infrastructure development**]{.underline} [could focus on
distributed **electricity grids**]{.underline}, **[port
facilities]{.underline}**, [and overland freight transport]{.underline}
[associated with **mineral extraction**]{.underline} (particularly
**[rare earth minerals]{.underline}**) rather than on oil and gas. All
are consistent with the Biden climate plan. [New ports and rail lines
could be funded through **cost**-**sharing** agreements between the
government and business, which could make **infrastructure**
cost-effective for business while saving the taxpayer
money.]{.underline} [[The **private sector** could use the
**infrastructure** during **normal times**]{.underline}, [with the U.S.
military having priority use during military
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} [or national emergencies.]{.underline}

Political Will

Demonstrating the political will to use Arctic capabilities unilaterally
or in conjuncture with allies and partners is the other prerequisite for
successful deterrence and defense. The most important priority should be
to convince allies that the United States is a reliable security
partner. Some of that persuasion has already begun with the Biden
administration's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article
5 security guarantees and Blinken's consultations in Denmark before the
May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting.

Persuading allies also requires demonstrating the ability to come to
their defense if needed, regardless of climate conditions. Unilateral,
bilateral, and "mini-multilateral" military exercises are all useful as
practice and as international signals in the Arctic. Unilaterally, the
U.S. Army is starting to relearn how to operate in the Arctic, as
highlighted in its Arctic strategy. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps
learned important lessons from NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in 2018
and smaller exercises since then. More exercises are needed to
demonstrate to friend and foe alike that the U.S. military can again
operate in cold climates.

In addition, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should expand]{.underline} **[its use]{.underline}** [of flexible
basing and **deployment** agreements with allies]{.underline}. [The
recent agreement covering the U.S. military's use of the Ramsund naval
facility and Evenes air base in northern Norway are a good start. A
similar arrangement could be made for the Danish air force to have
permanent facilities at the U.S. base in Thule,]{.underline} Greenland,
for search and rescue, air surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and air
interdiction missions, something that could tie allied forces more
closely together, better defend this early warning facility, and improve
surveillance in the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap. Expansion of
the runway and facilities on Norway's Jan Mayen island and refurbishing
an additional airfield in Greenland in conjunction with the Danes could
serve similar purposes. Finally, [the United States could coordinate
existing niche capabilities amongst Arctic allies, an]{.underline}
Arctic version of NATO's Connected Forces Initiative.

magnetic, gravity, seismic, or other systems are used to detect or imply
the presence of such minerals, and (2) any drilling, whether on or off
known geological structures, including the drilling of a well in which a

drilling of any additional delineation well after such discovery which
is needed to delineate any reservoir and to enable the lessee to

#### Violation---The aff does not do mineral exploration or development

#### Voting Issue -- Prefer our interpretation for three reasons

#### Better Limits -- Without a narrow definition of exploration and development the aff could do virtually anything related to the arctic. It massively expands the topic. We still allow a large topic because there are dozens on minerals in the arctic they could build affs around

#### Creates a clear distinction between exploration and development---Broad definitions make distinctions between the terms impossible.

#### Stable, predictable negative ground---Broad definitions of exploration and development make the resolution bidirectional.

## Framework

#### Topical affirmatives must instrumentally defend the United States federal government increasing its exploration and/or development of the Arctic\-\--they [don't]{.underline}:

#### "Resolved" requires law

**Words & Phrases 64**, (Words and Phrases, 1964, Permanent Edition)

[Definition of the word "[resolve,"]{.mark}]{.underline} given by
Webster [[is "to express an opinion or determination by **resolution**
or **vote**]{.mark}; as ['it was resolved by the legislature;" It is of
similar force to]{.mark} the word ["enact," which is
defined]{.mark}]{.underline} by Bouvier [[as]{.mark} meaning "**[to
establish by law]{.mark}**"]{.underline}.

#### Federal government is the legislative, executive and judicial

**US Legal No Date** (United States Federal Government Law and Legal
Definition
https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/united-states-federal-government/)

[[The United States Federal Government is established by the US
Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Federal Government shares
sovereignty over the United Sates with the individual governments of the
States of US. [[The Federal government has three

[[legislature]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is the US Congress, ii)
[[Executive]{.underline}]{.mark}, comprised of the President and Vice

Constitution prescribes a system of separation of powers and 'checks and
balances' for the smooth functioning of all the three branches of the
Federal Government. The US Constitution limits the powers of the Federal
Government to the powers assigned to it; all powers not expressly

**Supreme Court of Oklahoma 34**

(Swindall v. State Election Board, 168 Okla. 97, Lexis)//BB

However, I view another phase of the act which is not considered in the
majority opinion. It is my opinion that the expression, \"its
nominees,\" should have been construed by this court. Had this court so
construed those words, it would have assisted the State Election Board
in the furtherance of its ministerial duties, and would have set to rest
the immediate question. It is my theory that the correct interpretation
to place upon those words, \"its nominees,\" is to the effect that those
words do not mean all the nominees of any particular party. [The word
\"its\" is the possessive case]{.underline}, or the possessive adjective
[of \"it\", meaning]{.underline} of or **[belonging to
it.]{.underline}** Webster\'s International Dictionary. In other words,
the expression, \"its nominees,\" as applied to the Republican party,
means nominees of it (the Republican party). The words, \"nominees\" of
the \"Republican party,\" do not and necessarily cannot mean all the
nominees of the Republican party. Those words, however, do mean more
than one nominee. It seems reasonable to conclude, in the absence of an
expression like \"all of its nominees,\" or words of similar import,
that it was not the intent of the Legislature to make those words, \"its
nominees,\" all inclusive. It seems to me that a fair and reasonable
interpretation would be that those words support and embrace the thought
expressed by the New York statute, to wit, that it is the intention of
the candidate to support generally at the next general election the
nominees of the party from which he seeks his nomination, or that it is
his intention to support a majority of the candidates of that party.

#### Vote NEG, [three]{.underline} impacts:

#### First, [FAIRNESS]{.underline}\-\--a [limitless]{.underline} topic allows teams to race to the [margins]{.underline} and pick a [true topic]{.underline} which obviates our argumentation and ground and [turns accessibility]{.underline}\-\--that [outweighs]{.underline} because debate is [innately competitive,]{.underline} and fairness ensures [equal access]{.underline} for both sides. A [retreat from controversy]{.underline} and stasis [zeroes adaptive research]{.underline}, in-depth [innovation]{.underline}, and [preparation]{.underline}. Only [equal access]{.underline} to the ballot [actualizes]{.underline} debate's [pedagogical benefits]{.underline}.

#### Second, [CLASH]{.underline}. Open subjects cause [monopolization]{.underline} of the high ground, denying a role for the negative and [preventing]{.underline} second level testing. Only a [predictable]{.underline} stasis leads to in-depth preparation, iterative improvement of arguments, and [rigorous]{.underline} testing that [prevents]{.underline} polarization and false positives.

#### Third, It undermines topic education---Learning Arctic Literacy is of vital importance

#### Developing Arctic literacy is vital for students in the U.S.

Even though polar regions are far away from most of the world's
population, they profoundly impact lower-latitude weather patterns,
raise sea level, and figure prominently in the world\'s economy and
security (National Science Foundation (NSF), Citation2020). The changing
polar environments have created important scientific and societal
concerns, including disruptions to Northern Hemisphere weather, shifting
fisheries, and rising sea levels. Given these far-reaching impacts,
[[understanding polar regions]{.underline}]{.mark}, polar processes and
the connections between climate change at the poles and global climate
[[is important for people across the world. "What happens in polar
regions affects all of us"]{.underline}]{.mark} has been the theme of
the 2020 International Polar Week. [[There is a critical imperative for
polar education to reach]{.underline}]{.mark} education professionals,
[[students of all ages,]{.mark} and the public]{.underline}. The remote
polar regions and extreme conditions under which
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} is conducted [[in the Arctic provide
unique opportunities for capturing the imagination of learners and the
public on topics]{.underline}]{.mark} ranging from science, history,
culture, economics and geography to the arts. At the same time, lack of
accessibility makes it difficult to provide authentic field and at-sea
research experiences for those living outside the polar regions,
allowing only few scientists and many fewer teachers and students from
lower latitudes to participate. Initiatives that connect the Arctic and
Antarctic researchers to learners worldwide, using modern
telecommunication tools, and vetted polar education materials are two
key ingredients for increasing general public polar literacy. For over a
century, the U.S. and countries across the world have invested
significant resources in polar research, illustrated by large
international research campaigns during the four International Polar
Years (IPY) between 1882 and 2008. The U.S. intensified this investment
in polar research, when in 2017 Navigating the New Arctic was announced
as one of the agencies' ten big ideas aiming to improve observations
across the Arctic, the understanding of the Arctic system, and global
impacts. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of
Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition is one example of this renewed
national investment in polar research, which had a major public
engagement component. This year-long expedition (2019-2020) allowed over
500 researchers from over 20 nations to collect observations and
communicate findings on an on-going basis, as their research vessel,
frozen in sea ice, drifted across the Arctic Ocean. While many of the
large research programs have included significant investment in public
outreach and education, such as the 4th IPY (2007--2008), Study of
Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), and MOSAiC, a large proportion of
respondents on national surveys do not consider themselves informed
about polar regions, and [[knowledge about polar
regions]{.underline}]{.mark} has been and [[continues to be limited
among the U.S. population]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hamilton, Citation2016;
Hamilton, Cutter, and Schaefer, Citation2012). For example, the
nationally representative 2016 Polar, Environment, and Science (POLES)
survey showed that less than half of the U.S. public understand the
location of the north and the south poles (Hamilton, Citation2016;
Hamilton et al., Citation2019). Similarly, nationally representative
surveys show that more than half of Americans achieve the equivalent of
a failing grade on a climate knowledge survey (Ballew et al.,
Citation2019; Leiserowitz et al., Citation2010). However, at the same
time, six out of ten Americans indicate that climate change affects
their local community "a great deal" or "to some extent" (Funk &
Kennedy, Citation2019). So, while people are aware of local impacts of a
changing climate, their understanding of the climate system and related
connections to polar regions is limited. [[The lack of broad polar
literacy]{.underline}]{.mark} among the public [[combined with the
importance of the polar regions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the global
climate and socio-economic systems [[highlight the need for
engaging]{.underline}]{.mark} and effective
[[educational]{.mark}]{.underline} materials and [[experiences that
bring polar research and findings to learners in the lower latitudes.
Polar]{.underline}]{.mark} regions and [[topics are largely
absent]{.underline}]{.mark} from educational standards and few teachers
undergo training around polar topics as part of their education. Many
opportunities exist through formal learning in K-16 settings and
improved preparation of teachers, as well as through informal learning
environments, such as museums, parks, planetariums, and nature centers
in which both climate literacy and the understanding of connections
between polar regions and global climate change can be highlighted. A
Polar Literacy initiative, led by Rutgers University, has made progress
in identifying seven Polar Literacy Principles and corresponding topics
to support the work of educators and scientists to increase the public's
understanding of the importance of polar regions (McDonnell et al.,
Citation2020).
