[[We demand immediate action against the climate
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding the issues raised in the IPCC
report. We have talked about the consequences of climate change and the
impacts our community has been facing for years. [[We are not in a
position to reduce the impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} and we need to start
integration for our culture, languages and livelihoods to survive. [[As
the IPCC report gives brutal facts about the climate crisis, we demand
that governments take the report seriously and listen to the
science]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Science is on our
side.]{.underline}]{.mark} We demand that we are equally involved in
conversations regarding climate change at a national and international
level as expert speakers and knowledge holders. We deserve reserved
seats at negotiation tables and work groups. [[We demand concrete
action]{.underline}]{.mark} and our own mechanisms to the laws to get
the necessary support as we integrate to climate change. [[We demand
that governments commit to carbon neutrality and to the emission
reductions pointed out by the IPCC.]{.underline}]{.mark} Government
action should not weaken Sámi youths' livelihoods and culture. Before
our lands have been sacrificed to be exploited and ruined but now the
land is demanded to be used in green colonialism for actions against
climate change. We will not take responsibility for climate change and
sacrifice our culture and land for these actions as we are not
responsible for the need of the actions.

Abstract

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), as a combined
U.S.-Canada command charged with aerospace warning, aerospace control,
and maritime warning in the defense of North America, identifies cruise
missile attacks as a serious threat to the U.S. homeland.1 [**Russia**
and **China** continue to diversify their **arsenals** of]{.underline}
guided **[missiles]{.underline}**, which can fly at low altitudes, have
unpredictable flight paths, may reach hypersonic speeds, and be launched
from air, sea, or subsurface platforms.

[[The **Arctic**]{.mark} has [remained an **attractive**]{.mark}
**attack [vector]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} both U.S. and
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n long-range aviation
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} missiles since the earliest days of the Cold
War. [The]{.underline} growing [Arctic presence of **[China]{.mark}**,
a]{.underline} self-proclaimed ["near-Arctic state"]{.underline}
possessing an increasingly robust long-range aviation and missile
inventory, [reinforces the region's **significance** [as]{.mark} a
[**staging ground** for]{.mark} air and cruise **missile
[attacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The U.S. Department of Defense continues to invest billions to defend
against limited ballistic missile attacks, but [the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} military's [[ability to
**detect**]{.underline}]{.mark}, track, and defeat [[a]{.mark} **cruise
missile [strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} emanating [from the **Arctic**
[has **degraded**]{.mark}]{.underline} significantly [over the past 30
years. [**China** or **Russia** could **exploit this**]{.mark}
**shortfall**]{.underline} using conventional cruise missile attacks [to
[deal **a quick blow** that keeps **U.S.**]{.mark} **military
[forces]{.mark}** [at distance]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid a nuclear
response.

[Bolstering **[deterrence]{.mark}** against]{.underline} conventional
air and cruise [missile threats **in the Arctic** [starts by]{.mark}
improving]{.underline} U.S., ally, and partner [**[domain
awareness]{.mark}** and **info**]{.underline}rmation [dominance
capabilities. [Adversaries]{.mark} will [**be disinclined** to **launch
strikes** on the]{.mark} U.S. [homeland if **they know**]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
**anticipating**]{.mark} the [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} and creating
options to dissuade it. Achieving better domain awareness involves
efforts to provide indications and warning of attacks through the
detection, tracking, characterization, warning, and attribution of
modern threats.2 Establishing information dominance enables U.S. leaders
to access decision-quality information more quickly than adversaries.
Domain awareness and information dominance can underwrite a
comprehensive "missile defeat" strategy, left and right of launch, that
gives U.S. leaders more options to deter an attack on the U.S. homeland.

Introduction

In keeping with his penchant for making bold predictions about the
future of airpower, Army Air Corps Brigadier General William "Billy"
Mitchell told a U.S. Senate Committee in 1935 that Alaska would become
"the most important strategic place in the world."3 In the mind of
Mitchell, widely considered the father of the U.S. Air Force, the reason
for the strategic significance of Alaska, and the Arctic more broadly,
came down to its accessibility by air. By Mitchell's calculations, U.S.
Army aircraft of the time could reach any capital in the Northern
Hemisphere within nine hours.4 He also warned that the dawn of aviation
would allow adversaries to capitalize on new attack vectors [through the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} because of the [**short, direct
[aviation routes]{.mark}** between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **Eurasia**,]{.underline} particularly
[between **Alaska** and **Siberia**]{.underline}. In his 1930 book,
Skyways, Mitchell warned, "It is [along **these lines**]{.underline}
that [future **invasions will come** because they [are the
**shortest**]{.mark} **lines** and aircraft will **fly directly** along
them]{.underline}."5

Today, Mitchell's predictions regarding the strategic significance of
the northern approaches seem even more prescient. [The **shortest path**
by air]{.underline} to North America [[for]{.mark} **Russian** or
**Chinese** [missiles]{.mark}, fighters, and bombers is still over the
**polar region**]{.underline}. Both have diversified their cruise
missile arsenals and expanded their ability to launch cruise missile
strikes on the continental United States from the air, sea, and land
(see Figure 2).

[[Yet,]{.mark} the U.S. [ability **to detect**]{.mark}, track,
attribute]{.underline}, and counter these [[**attacks** has]{.mark}
significantly **[diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the end of the
Cold War. This reality was [[laid bare]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
American public in January 2023, [[when a]{.mark} **Chinese [spy
balloon]{.mark}** [entered]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. airspace [north of
**[Alaska]{.mark}**]{.underline} and drifted across the entire country
before NORAD shot it down. General Glen VanHerck, Commander of U.S.
Northern Command and NORAD, later testified to Congress that four
Chinese surveillance balloons had previously transited U.S. airspace
undetected: "That's a domain awareness gap we'll have to figure out," he
told lawmakers.6

This paper examines the strategic implications of growing air and cruise
missile threats emanating from the high north, as well as potential
near-term approaches to address those threats. Mitchell Institute met
with over a dozen NORAD/NORTHCOM personnel in Colorado Springs, CO in
March 2023, interviewed experts from industry and academia, conducted a
review of government budget and strategy documents, and digested
contemporary academic and policy papers to address three core questions:

• To what extent do Russian and Chinese interests and missile
capabilities in the Arctic pose a threat to the U.S. homeland?

• How and why is the U.S. approach to deterring air and cruise missile
threats in the Arctic changing, and what are the risks and benefits of
that approach?

• What steps can the United States take to bolster deterrence in the
Arctic region, and what are some specific capabilities needed to do so?

Importantly, analysis revealed that [**Arctic** [domain
**awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} and information dominance [[should
be]{.mark} a **[top]{.mark}**]{.underline} DOD [**[priority
now]{.mark}**, not in a decade or more, [to shore
up]{.mark}]{.underline} cruise missile [**defense** of **[the
homeland]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United States and Canada have
tentative plans to field additional over-the-horizon radars (OTHR) that
can detect a broad swath of threats like bombers flying at medium
altitudes, low-flying cruise missiles, and even surface ships in the
next five to ten years.7 But [the risk that **adversaries** could turn
**regional conflicts**]{.underline} into global ones [already **exists
today**]{.underline}---whether it is through kinetic [cruise **missile**
attacks]{.underline}, non-kinetic [**cyberattacks**, or]{.underline}
even [**provocative** ISR overflights of the U.S. **homeland** that lead
to inadvertent **escalation** or **miscalc**]{.underline}ulation.

[**Russia** and]{.underline}, increasingly, [**China** are building up
capabilities to deal the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [a **quick, painful blow**]{.underline}
specifically [designed **to coerce** the U.S.]{.underline} Government
[to **abstain** from]{.underline} further [involvement]{.underline}
without provoking a nuclear response. China and Russia's development of
longer-range weapons, combined with new capabilities to strike through
cyberspace and space, is specifically aimed to help them achieve this
goal. The DOD must find new ways to deter and defeat these threats that
may be conventional in character but can have long-lasting, even
existential, strategic effects on the United States, its allies, and its
partners.

Unfortunately, completing kill chains against cruise missiles that can
maneuver and fly at low altitudes is notoriously difficult. Cruise
missiles can be difficult to detect from a distance, which reduces time
and options to counter them. Even if they are detected and attributed in
time to act, it is resource-intensive to shoot them down using DOD's
current kinetic defenses, which tend to be expensive and create an
unfavorable cost-exchange ratio. As subsonic garden-variety cruise
missiles continue to evolve and proliferate globally, other air and
missile threats, including hypersonic and ballistic missiles,
uninhabited aircraft, and even China's fractional orbital bombardment
system (FOBs), are posing increasingly complex challenges to U.S.
homeland defense.

To deal with these threats, U.S. defense leaders have gradually adopted
a new emphasis over the last decade on a holistic concept called
"missile defeat."8 Rather than narrowly focusing on kinetic kill options
to deny adversary attacks, missile defeat involves using the entire
spectrum of options to prevent and defeat missile threats, from
countering proliferation to early indications and warning and, of
course, detection, tracking, and intercepting cruise missiles. It also
seeks to integrate defensive, offensive, passive, kinetic, and
non-kinetic capabilities, the latter of which could include cyber
warfare, directed energy, and electronic attacks (see Figure 4).9

NORAD, which has more than half its area of responsibility focused on
the Arctic, mainly channels its missile defeat efforts into detecting
threats as early and proactively as possible. To this end, NORAD/U.S.
Northern Command, have made "all domain awareness" a top priority. As
applied to air and missile threats, the term describes all efforts to
enable "indications and warnings through detection, tracking,
identification, characterization, warning and attribution."10 The goal
of this "left-of-launch" approach is to expand decision space for senior
U.S. leaders so they are not left with only highly escalatory response
options, such as preemptive or retaliatory strikes.11 Gen VanHerck
describes the ability to give U.S. decisionmakers the information needed
to expand their options as "information dominance" and argues that
increased domain awareness, when combined with information dominance,
will lead to enhanced deterrence.12

Over, Through, & Under: Russian & Chinese Threats from the Northern
Approaches

To what extent do Russian and Chinese interests and missile capabilities
in the Arctic pose a threat to the U.S. homeland? Homeland defense,
defined as "the protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic
population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats
and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President," is the
responsibility of the U.S. Department of Defense.13 Adversaries that
pose the most credible and stressing threats to U.S. national security
generally meet three criteria: 1) their objectives are adversarial to
U.S. interests; 2) their actions threaten important U.S. interests; and
3) they possess the significant military capabilities necessary to
follow through on those hostile intentions.14 In the Arctic region, both
Russia and, increasingly, China fit these criteria and therefore pose a
serious challenge for U.S. homeland defense strategy and force planning.

Russian & Chinese Arctic Activities Threaten the U.S. Homeland

The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of
eight nations: Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (including Greenland),
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.15 Yet,
despite the Arctic's geographic size, proximity to U.S. territory, and
role as a staging ground for offensive missile strikes, the 2022
National Defense Strategy warns that "U.S. activities and posture in the
Arctic should be calibrated, as the Department preserves its focus on
the Indo-Pacific region."16

[[A]{.mark} central [goal of]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. efforts to
bolster [[deterrence is]{.underline}]{.mark} focused on [[dissuading
**China** or **Russia**]{.mark} from attempting to **[rapidly
seize]{.mark}** the territory of [a U.S. ally]{.mark} or partner [like
**Taiwan** or]{.mark} one or more of the **[Baltic
states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.17 So it is a natural and appropriate
result that, today, the center of gravity for great power competition
and conflict is in these adversaries' near peripheries in the
Indo-Pacific and Europe.18 But [[**China** and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark} and other adversaries also
[[recognize]{.mark} America's power projection **advantages** and are
developing]{.underline} strategies and doctrine around cruise
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} and other long-range capabilities [to
**[prevent]{.mark}** the **[U.S. forces]{.mark}** from
[deploying]{.mark} abroad **[in the first place]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[The **high north** is]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming [an increasingly
**[attractive]{.mark} vector** [for]{.mark} Russian and Chinese missile
[**strikes** on the]{.mark} U.S. **[homeland]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
More than half the Arctic coastline is sovereign Russian territory.19
Russia is modernizing its military bases and airfields, deploying new
coastal air defenses and submarines, and increasing its military
exercises and training within its 5th Military District, Moscow's Arctic
combatant command.20 China now self identifies as a "near-Arctic state,"
has expanded Arctic scientific research activities that have military
applications, invested more than \$90 billion in Arctic infrastructure
projects, and stated its intent to build a "polar silk road."21

[[The world]{.mark} now [faces **converging threats**: China]{.mark} is
carrying out]{.underline} the largest peacetime **[military
buildup]{.underline}** since Nazi Germany's, producing warships, combat
aircraft, and missiles five to six times as fast as the United States
can. [**[Russia]{.mark}** is waging]{.underline} Europe's biggest
[war]{.underline} since World War II. [**[Iran]{.mark}** is trading
blows with **Israel**, [and **No**]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [is sending]{.underline} thousands of
[**troops** to fight for **Russia**]{.underline} in Ukraine [while
preparing]{.underline} for war with South Korea and developing
**[nuclear missiles]{.underline}** that can reach the U.S. mainland.
Despite treating these regimes as enemies, the United States spends only
2.7 percent of GDP on defense, a level comparable to that of the
post--Cold War 1990s and the isolationist 1930s and well below the Cold
War range of six to ten percent. A military recruitment crisis compounds
the shortfall, with 77 percent of young Americans ineligible for service
because of obesity, drug use, or health issues and just nine percent
expressing an interest in enlisting. In a potential conflict with China,
U.S. forces would blow through their munitions inventory in a matter of
weeks, and it would take years for the U.S. defense industrial base to
produce replacements. Rising personnel costs, along with an endless
array of peacetime missions, are stretching U.S. forces thin.

By pairing diplomatic hostility with military unreadiness, the United
States is once again sending the world a mixed signal, a yellow traffic
light. Yellow lights, of course, often prompt aggressive drivers to
speed up. American ambiguity won't matter---until it does, when China,
Iran, North Korea, or Russia decides it's time to take what it has long
claimed by force.

THE DANGERS OF DECLINISM

Since the Soviet Union's collapse, experts have urged policymakers to
prepare for multipolarity, expecting the United States to be challenged
or overtaken by rising powers. But reality has taken a different course.
The United States remains economically dominant while other
contenders---both adversaries and allies---are slipping into long-term
decline. Shrinking populations and stagnant productivity are eroding the
strength of once dominant Eurasian powers. Meanwhile, populous countries
such as India and Nigeria struggle to ascend global value chains because
of poor infrastructure, corruption, and weak education systems.
Automation and the commodification of manufacturing are shutting off
traditional growth paths, leaving many developing countries mired in
debt, youth unemployment, and political instability. Rather than
triggering a rise of the rest, current trends are solidifying a unipolar
world with the United States as the sole superpower, surrounded by
declining great powers and a periphery of middle powers, developing
countries, and failing states.

In the long run, [a [world without **rising powers**]{.mark} could
[foster **stability**]{.mark} by [reducing]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark}
**hegemonic [wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Over the past 250 years, the
Industrial Revolution caused economies, populations, and militaries to
double or more in size within a generation, sparking intense competition
for resources and territory. But that era is winding down. Shrinking
populations, stagnant economies, and the concentration of wealth in the
United States make the rise of new great powers unlikely. Some analysts
characterize China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia as an "axis," but the
world is unlikely to see a repeat of 1942, when Germany, Japan, and
Italy seized half of the world's productive capacity. Today's fading
challengers lack the strength to overrun Eurasia quickly, and once a
great power falters, it no longer has the population growth to rebound,
as Germany did between the world wars and the Soviet Union did after
World War II. It's hard to imagine Russia, for example, rising from the
ashes of Ukraine to conquer large swaths of Europe. As rising powers
fade, the world may become more stable.

[[But **right now**,]{.mark} several [**threats loom**. Declining
powers]{.mark} may [resort to]{.mark} **desperate [wars]{.mark}** of
irredentism [to reclaim]{.mark}]{.underline} what they believe are
["lost" **[territories]{.mark}**]{.underline} and avoid slipping
permanently into second-tier status. [[Russia]{.mark} has]{.underline}
already done this [[in **Ukraine**]{.mark}, and [China]{.mark}
might]{.underline} take similar actions [[in **Taiwan**]{.mark}
or]{.underline} against [the **[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
[the **[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea. Although [these conflicts]{.underline}
may not match World War II's scale, they [could]{.underline} still [be
ghastly, [involving **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} threats and
**[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** on critical infrastructure.
[**China**, **No**]{.underline}rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, [and
**Russia**]{.underline} face economic and demographic decline, but so do
their most likely targets---**[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [**Taiwan**, [and]{.mark} the
**[Baltic states]{.mark}**]{.underline}---ensuring that Eurasia's
military balances will [[remain]{.mark} **hotly [contested]{.mark}**.
Even without sparking **massive wars**, China and Russia
could]{.underline} gradually transform into gigantic North Koreas,
**[rely]{.underline}**ing increasingly [on
**totalitarianism**]{.underline} and military extortion to undermine an
international order they can no longer hope to dominate.

[Another threat is rampant **state failure**]{.underline}, particularly
in debt-ridden countries with rapidly growing populations. Sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, is expected to add one billion people by 2050, yet
most of its economies are already in fiscal crisis. Manufacturing no
longer provides mass employment, and governments are slashing social
spending to pay foreign loan interest. According to the United Nations,
an estimated 3.3 billion people live in countries where interest
payments exceed investments in either education or health care. The
stagnation of major economies is worsening the situation. A slowing
China, for instance, has halted most of its foreign lending while
reducing its imports from poor countries and flooding their markets with
subsidized exports, delivering a triple blow to their economies.

[A [spiral of state failure]{.mark} could
**[magnify]{.mark}**]{.underline} a third threat: the continued [rise of
**[anti-liberalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} in democratic countries. Many
democracies are already struggling with demographic decline, sluggish
economic growth, soaring debt, and ascendant extremist parties. [A
[surge of **refugees**]{.mark}]{.underline} from failing states [could
further **strengthen** these]{.underline} antidemocratic movements.
After the Syrian civil war sent more than a million refugees to Europe,
for example, authoritarian parties made substantial gains across the
continent. Liberal democracy has flourished in times of economic
expansion, population growth, and social cohesion, but it's uncertain
whether it can survive an era of stagnation and mass migration.

The United States must contain these threats while continuing to harness
its geographic, demographic, and institutional advantages. A crucial
first step is rejecting the misperception that the country is doomed to
decline. Nearly four decades ago, the political scientist Samuel
Huntington argued in these pages that Americans must fear decline to
avoid it. But fear risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. An
exaggerated sense of decay is already starting to destabilize democracy,
as some Americans lose faith in the system and turn to antiliberal
solutions. Some are rallying behind white nationalism, propelled by
fears of demographic shifts and "great replacement" conspiracy theories,
which falsely claim that political elites encourage mass immigration to
replace white Americans with minorities. Others are stoking minority
grievances to mobilize voters along ethnic lines. Such cynical
strategies have fostered harmful policies, such as defunding the police
or mass deportations, eroding trust in democracy and potentially
enabling demagogues to dismantle the republic's checks and balances.

Fearing decline, the United States might lean toward protectionism and
xenophobia, walling itself off rather than competing internationally,
which would undermine its core strengths. The country has thrived on the
free flow of goods, people, and ideas, soaking up foreign talent and
capital like a sponge and building a global commercial order that
attracts allies. But if the United States embraces a false narrative of
decline, it risks becoming a rogue superpower, a mercantilist behemoth
determined to squeeze every ounce of wealth and power from the rest of
the world. Tariffs, sanctions, and military threats could replace
diplomacy and trade, alliances might become protection rackets, and
immigration could be sharply restricted. This nativist turn might yield
short-term gains for Americans, but it would ultimately hurt them by
making the world they inhabit poorer and less secure. Trade and
[**[security networks]{.mark}** could [**collapse**, sparking
**resource**]{.mark}-driven **[conflicts]{.mark}** and [killing
off]{.mark} any possibility for cooperation on **[nuclear
nonprolif]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration, [**[climate]{.mark}** change,
[**pandemics**, and other]{.mark}]{.underline} global
[**[challenges]{.mark}**---accelerating a descent into
**anarchy**.]{.underline}

could [generate]{.mark}]{.underline} existential harm, whether defined

**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**---alongside robust international
organizations, laws, norms, alliances, and economic
dependencies---[[helps]{.mark} **make [that]{.mark}**
[happen]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Global governments and organizations aiming to reduce existential risks
should support nuclear risk-reduction measures but oppose quick,
complete abolition of nuclear weapons. Nuclear abolition creates serious
risk of returning to an era of [great power
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which [could drastically increase
**existential risk**]{.underline}. A global [war between **China**,
**Russia**, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
their]{.underline} respective [**allies** [risks]{.mark} the
**survival** of the global]{.underline} cooperative [system]{.underline}
necessary to combat other existential threats, while [threatening
[**infrastructure** necessary for **risk mitigation**]{.mark} measures
and accelerating]{.underline} other [**existential risk**
scenarios]{.underline}. As Iskander Rehman wrote in his recent in-depth
study of great power war: "Protracted great power [[wars are]{.mark}
immensely **[destructive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whole-of-society
affairs, the effects of which typically extend well beyond their point
of origin, spilling across multiple regions and [[siphoning]{.mark} huge
amounts of [**personnel**,]{.mark} materiel [and
**resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}... Ultimately, protracted great-power
wars usually only end when an adversary faces total annihilation, or
collapses under the weight of its own exhaustion." If the great powers
collapse, the global system may collapse with them. Nuclear
[[**deterrence** can]{.mark} help **[prevent
that]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Nuclear weapons place a cap on how bad great power conflict can become
and may deter the emergence and escalation of great power war. If China,
the United States, or Russia faced a genuine existential threat, the
nuclear weapons would emerge, threatening nuclear retaliation. As
Chinese General Fu Quanyou, head of the People Liberation's Army General
Staff until 2002, once said: "The U.S. and Soviet superpowers both had
strong nuclear capabilities able to destroy one another a number of
times, so they did not dare to clash with each other directly, war
capabilities above a certain point change into war-limiting
capabilities." Mutually assured destruction also helps prevent serious
great power conflict from breaking out in the first place. During the
current war between Ukraine and Russia, Russian President Vladimir
Putin has used nuclear threats to deter direct NATO involvement and keep
the conflict local. The United States might wish to support Ukraine
against Russia, but it's not willing to risk a Russian nuclear strike on
New York City or Washington, DC to do more than provide money and
material. Removing that deterrence by banning nuclear weapons means a
potential return to protracted, global great power war.

To emphasize: Opposing quick, complete abolition does not mean opposing
reduction of nuclear arsenals or risk reduction measures like improved
crisis management and ensuring human control over nuclear weapons.
Massive nuclear war is the most likely scenario for existential harm to
humanity in the near term. As the Chinese nuclear arsenal grows, and
China potentially aims for nuclear parity with the United States in the
coming decades, that problem is going to get worse. Current nuclear
weapon strategies depend on targeting adversary nuclear weapons, which
means as an adversary builds more nuclear weapons, the United States
must build more too. If the United States builds more, so too will
Russia and China. Unchecked, nuclear arsenal sizes could quickly spiral
upwards, passing the heights of the Cold War when the United States had
23,000 nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union had 39,000.

The risks of great power war. War among great powers increases
existential risk in at least four ways. First, the global cooperative
system necessary to combat existential threats may be seriously damaged
or destroyed. Second, [**[combatants]{.mark}** might
[target]{.mark}]{.underline} and destroy
**[[infra]{.underline}]{.mark}**structure [[and **capacity**
necessary]{.mark} to implement existential **risk mitigation**
measures]{.underline}. Third, military necessity may accelerate the
development of technologies like artificial intelligence that create new
existential risks. Fourth, a great power war following nuclear abolition
could touch off rapid, unstable nuclear rearmament and proliferation.

dynamics in the very spaces in which geography reproduces
itself]{.underline}. This work has included developing decolonizing
frameworks in organizing conferences which were previously asserting
criticality (centering feminist, queer, anti-capitalist, critical race
approaches) absent a significant consideration of settler colonialism
("Decolonizing Cascadia? Rethinking Critical Geographies" conference
organizing committee, 2014). [Further, collaborative dialogue and
writing among Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars is a growing
practice in which dynamics of colonialism, decolonization, and
Indigenous resurgence can be thought through in order to make visible
some of the tensions in decolonizing work on the ground and in everyday
life]{.underline} (Holmes, Hunt, & Piedalue, 2015; Hunt & Holmes, 2015;
de Leeuw, Cameron, & Greenwood, 2012.) While some of this work is
difficult to find in standard search engines due to its circulation
among more localized networks---a purposeful effort to produce research
outcomes for the communities they are about---other publications have
been written for scholarly audiences. As discussed by Coombes, Johnson,
and Howitt (2014), unsettling community-based research and publication
with Indigenous communities requires "a new relational ethics which
unsettles any remaining binaries that survived the qualitative
revolution in human geography: Ethics becomes method; data becomes life;
landscape becomes author\' participants become family" (p. 850).
Geographers have reflected on their own relational processes for truly
shifting power of authorial voice within collaborative research (McLean,
Howitt, Colyer, Raven, & Woodward, 2016; Woodward & Marrfurra McTaggart,
2016); for example, working in the settler colonial context of
Australia, geographers Sarah Wright, Kate Lloyd, and Sandie
Suchet-Pearson have worked to center the agency of Indigenous peoples
and places by making the place itself, Bawaka Country, the lead author
in several research publications (see Bawaka Country et al., 2013, 2014,
2016). While this work is by no means complete, nor without potential
for scrutiny in the future, it does signal concrete practices meant to
disrupt normative colonial ways of thinking and being.

#### Critical geographies face institutional limitations that prevent radical change. 

**Kinkaid 19**, post-doctoral scholar in human geographies @ university
of Delaware. (Eden, 2019, "At the limits of critical geography: Creative
interventions into the exclusionary spaces of U.S. geography," Gender,
Place & Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography, Routledge, Taylor &
Francis Group)

Having introduced select pieces from the CFVA, I will now discuss some
of the institutional difficulties encountered in advocating for their
inclusion. I will focus on dialogues surrounding two works in particular
that arose during the planning of the exhibit. Upon critical analysis,
it seems that these works were seen as potentially controversial by
virtue of the fact that they worked to disrupt institutional space,
identities, and norms, a concern that was rather ironic given the nature
of the conference. [While]{.underline} intellectual
'**[disruption]{.underline}**,' especially 'spatial disruption,' is an
effect we might expect [of]{.underline} **[critical-creative geographic
interventions]{.underline}** -- [if not the entire purpose of engaging
these approaches]{.underline} -- [[it became]{.mark} clear that [**some
forms of disruption were** seen as **acceptable** while **others** were
less '**legitimate**.']{.mark}]{.underline}

This potentially disruptive character of some works produced tensions in
vetting and planning the exhibit. At the time of planning, there were no
agreed upon criteria for judging artworks; it was mostly left to the
curator (the author) to organize the exhibit. As the specter of
controversial content arose, conversations occurred between the curator
and a key organizer, as well as with a departmental administrator. The
larger committee (named 'the critical geography collective') composed of
faculty and graduate students was only brought in on these conversations
toward the end of the process, specifically to make sure everyone was
'on board' for a drag performance and to approve a list and descriptions
of the works. [Thus, [many]{.mark} of these **issues** and
[**decisions** were **engaged**]{.mark} **outside** of the
'**collective**,' [**closing down** opportunities for more sustained and
**democratic** forms of **debate** and
decision-making.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Envisioning 'critical geographies'

At the outset of this discussion, it is worth considering how [**[the
self-perception of critical geographers as 'critical']{.underline}**
[can ironically operate as an obstacle to identifying the inflection of
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}, sexism, homophobia, [[and]{.underline}
**[other forms of oppression and exclusion]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
this institutional space. Ahmed aptly remarks:

> [I suspect that criticality -- the self-perception that in being
> critical we do not have a problem or **that in being critical we are
> over it** -- is often used and performed in these academic spaces. I
> have called critical racism and critical sexism this: the racism and
> sexism reproduced by those who think of themselves as **too critical
> to reproduce racism and sexism**]{.underline}. (2017, 155)

These contradictions do not go unnoticed, at least by those of us who
experience the personal and professional impacts of such lapses in
criticality. Indeed, '\[t\]his 'not translation' is something we
experience: it is a gap between a symbolic commitment and a lived
reality' (2017, 90). It is in these moments of 'not translation' that
the lines delineating what we do and do not do as critical geographers,
who we are and are not, what we challenge and what we accept, are drawn,
articulated, and reinforced. [At the most benign, I argue, when we fail
to confront these moments critically, [we fail to provide models to
others of scholarship that challenges]{.mark} and addresses exclusionary
[norms]{.mark}, and we fail to educate each other]{.underline}. At
worst, when we do not intervene, [we send messages to students and
colleagues about what kinds of **knowledge**]{.underline},
**[meanings]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[experience]{.underline}** [will be recognized in the discipline, and
consequently, what **kinds of bodies** and **identities** will be
recognized.]{.underline}

This is to say that seemingly minor decisions, made in the heat of the
moment or without much thought, reinforce norms that constitute the
institutional and intellectual space of the discipline. For some, these
moments are experienced as anything but minor: the confusion and
internal conflict they spawn produces a sense of bodily and intellectual
alienation that becomes a constitutive, almost ontological condition of
one's experience of institutional space as a minority subject (Puwar
2004). Yet these difficult moments might also serve as a critical
intellectual resource: '\[w\]e might work over, mull over, these
experiences; we might keep coming back to them because they do not make
sense' (Ahmed 2017, 21). [While these ideas may seem abstract or removed
from everyday institutional life, in the following analysis, I aim to
demonstrate how they are actually very concrete and how 'minor'
incidents accumulate to reproduce structures and spaces of
inequality]{.underline}.

A critical reading of the production of the exhibit illuminates how
[**[particular understandings]{.underline}** [of 'critical geography'
shaped]{.underline}]{.mark} [the institutional [management of the
exhibit,]{.mark} while **[reinforcing]{.mark} normative [subject
positions and marginalizing others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here, the
erratic and at times [[contradictory discursive mobilizations of]{.mark}
the meanings of '[critical geographies']{.mark}, intellectual
'legitimacy', 'institutional optics', 'political climate', nonconsensual
or forceful intellectual confrontation, 'blowback', and 'family
friendliness' in relation to apparently worrisome interventions into
institutional space and disciplinary identity [prove instructive for
evaluating]{.mark} the potentials and [limitations]{.mark} of
critical-creative geographic scholarship.]{.underline}

Political climate' and the threat of 'blowback'

The various **[[departmental reactions]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the
prospect of displaying artistic works in the hallways [[speak to]{.mark}
the recognized ability of artworks to disrupt and challenge all kinds of
norms]{.underline}. In fact, [much of the discussion surrounding the
exhibit focused on]{.underline} **[[managing
controversies]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it might produce. [[One of the
first questions]{.mark} I [was]{.mark} asked by an administrator (who
was not otherwise involved in organizing the conference) was whether or
not the artwork would be suitable for public consumption.]{.underline}
When I asked for clarification, the question was rephrased as '**[[is it
going to be family friendly?']{.underline}]{.mark}** As it happened, one
of the 'potentially controversial' pieces to be discussed was a drag
performance. As a queer-identified person inhabiting a heteronormative
institution, I was incapable of answering this question: were drag
queens family friendly? Are non-normatively gendered people family
friendly?

[This vague signaling of controversy accomplished through the phrase
'family friendly' can be critically read as an attempt to draw on
commonsense norms and expectations about what (and who) does and does
not belong in this institutional space]{.underline}. Even before
specific works were discussed, certain terms -- 'family friendly,'
'political climate,' and 'blowback' -- were commonsensically deployed
and set the tone of the larger conversation. For example, as a preface
to a discussion of the exhibit, the administrator argued that 'in this
political climate' we had to be careful about displaying artwork in the
hallways. [These terms were never defined or described, they merely
functioned to heighten the sense of **risk and potential controversy
that attended the prospect of engaging artwork**]{.underline}.

While most of the works in the exhibit were anything but controversial,
there were a few submissions that I felt the need to discuss in advance,
given the general sense of concern voiced by my seniors. The first such
contribution was the drag performance, which I will detail at length in
a moment. The second work was a sculpture entitled 'Redbone,' submitted
by Ciara Newton, the artist who produced Slave Money. The sculpture was
not graphic or offensive in any way: it was a large, red sculpture of a
bone. However, given the title, which could be read as 'racially
charged' (though likely would be entirely overlooked by white people), I
felt the need to contextualize the work. The sculpture was a commentary
on the artist's racial identity as a person of white, black, and
indigenous heritage. In explaining the work to me, she described an
experience as a young girl walking in a parking lot in her Midwestern
hometown and having 'redbone' shouted at her. The work, then, was a
critical commentary and redeployment. I thus explained to the
administrator that 'redbone' could function as a slur if shouted at a
person in a parking lot, but that here it was not functioning as such. I
provided the analogy of queer: if someone shouts 'queer' at a person in
a parking lot, it functions as an epithet, if a person self-describes as
queer, its meaning is different. As such, it is nonsensical and
problematic (as a group of white people) to police the use of the term
in this case. [This discussion was met with discomfort, and it was
ultimately suggested that this piece be displayed apart from the other
works in a graduate lounge, with the implicit assumption that this would
prevent people from seeing it and being offended by it.]{.underline}

Here, we can see how certain **[[institutional code words function as
performatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [they serve [to]{.mark} produce
(and [police]{.mark}) the [reality]{.mark} they claim to merely
name]{.underline} (Butler 1990). Seemingly innocent questions about
'family friendliness' and 'political climate' are in fact loaded with
meanings and implications; as Ahmed remarks, '\[t\]hese questions only
appear to be questions; they often work as assertions' (2017, 117). When
an unspecified 'political climate' was commonsensically deployed to
interrogate and police potentially controversial content, 'political
climate,' along with the inevitability of 'blowback,' became a
performative code word that naturalized our individual and collective
decisions about particular works. [These terms function effectively as
political tools because they are sufficiently vague that they cannot be
fully interrogated -- they assume a common-sense meaning -- yet at the
same time, they function in very specific ways to produce consensus
about institutional boundaries and possibilities.]{.underline}

Legitimate geographies and illegitimate geographers

These concerns about 'blowback' 'political climate' and 'family
friendliness' surrounded the very idea of the exhibit, before its
specificities were even considered. However, these more diffuse concerns
about the disruptive potential of artworks particularly condensed around
one work: a proposed drag performance, which, after various discussions
and negotiations, ultimately took the form of The Future Looks Queer.
This contribution, partly by virtue of its genre and largely by virtue
of its content (or imagined content), raised particular concerns, ones
which, from the perspective of a queer person, allegorize the
heteronormative tendencies of the department's institutional and social
culture. [Accordingly, it is worth attending at length to the particular
discourses mobilized in the 'approval' of this piece.]{.underline}

[[The first concern]{.mark} to emerge [was]{.mark} that a drag
performance could '**delegitimize critical geography**.]{.underline}' If
a drag performance was part of the conference, [[people might not take
critical geography seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, [[if
members of the department]{.mark}, who do not know much about critical
geography or already hold it in disrepute, were to encounter a drag
performance, this could further [delegitimize the subfield]{.mark} in
their eyes [and make it difficult to **advocate** for **institutional
support**]{.mark} at the **departmental level**]{.underline}. [It was
argued that [these '**institutional optics'** did not bode well for the
future]{.mark} of critical **geographies in the
department**.]{.underline}

The concern that queer submissions would delegitimize the discipline
were difficult to stomach, or even understand, as a queer person
studying queer geographies and cultural forms. Drag has long been a site
of analysis for scholarly work and, with the institutionalization of
geographies of sexuality and queer theory, has long ceased to be a
controversial site for academic interest. This is not to argue that such
a performance would be without potential 'blowback' or discomfort, but
that, as critical geographers, we ought to be willing to take such risks
and defend such interventions on the grounds that we are committed to
working against these exclusionary norms of institutional space.
[Regardless, to be implicitly asked to reconsider the necessity of
including a queer performance to protect the future prospects of the
subfield -- a subfield in which, by logical extension, my identity and
work are marginalized -- put me, as the curator, in an uncomfortable
position.]{.underline}

Another concern raised during discussions on the 'drag queen issue,'
revolved around the content of the performance. Indeed, concerns about
'blowback' dominated the conversation before the details of the
performance were even established or discussed. The prospect of having a
drag performance in the conference space was likened to unspecified
incidents (i.e., sex scandals?) at other universities that resulted in
the resignation of a provost and several faculty members. This reaction
was presumably in response to an expectation that the performance would
involve sexual content, though this was never directly stated. At this
point, the exact content of the performance had not been determined, as
the artist had not come to the building to explore potential performance
spaces, and any such considerations were suspended until they could be
assured that the performance would be permitted and that the exhibit
would be a safe space. Accordingly, I could not specify exactly what the
performance would entail. This lack of information did not help in
discussions about potentially controversial content, yet, even with
assurances that there would be absolutely no sexual content, discomfort
and resistance remained.

As a queer person, I can only imagine that my assurances that there
would be no inappropriate (i.e. sexual) content were ineffective because
it seemed that, for the person with this concern (a heterosexual male),
queer men in drag seemed to already necessarily express a sexual
content. Indeed, homophobia and transphobia are often sustained 'by
reading the expression of gender identity as itself a sexual act'
(Salamon 2018, 5). Here, following Ahmed, we can understand gender 'in
concrete forms of accommodation' (Ahmed 2017, 122). If we understand
that space is produced as heterosexual through particular practices
(Bell et al. 1994; Bell and Valentine 2003), the failure to accommodate
persons of non-normative genders and sexualities necessarily upholds and
reaffirms the heteronormativity of that space. [Thus, in order to
protect and accommodate problematic aspects of heterosexual, white male
gender identity, we must un-accommodate the marginalized identities that
might cause them minor discomfort or self-reflection]{.underline}. Too
often, **[[the inclusion of 'diversity' in institutional spaces is meted
in this way]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [it is tolerated to the extent that
it does not call into question dominant identities, resulting in the
marginalization and 'affective inequality' (Rodo-De-Z arate 2017) of
bodies that disrupt (hetero)normative space.]{.underline}

Intellectual 'confrontation' and externalization

[What is most interesting (and deeply ironic) about the management of
the 'potentially controversial' art is the manner in which **space**,
**boundaries**, and even **maps**, were the **technologies** used to
**police** these works at a **critical geography
conference**]{.underline}. Space became a central issue in managing the
threat of the drag performance. The original proposal for the submission
involved several performers stationed in the elevators, who would engage
visitors, put on makeup, and improvise as visitors travelled from the
first to third floor for refreshments and to visit the exhibit. This
plan was eventually rejected because it was a violation of safety codes.
However, before that judgment was reached, various other concerns
emerged that speak directly to the management of institutional space and
intellectual boundaries.

[A major issue identified in the elevator performance scenario was that
the elevators did not belong to the department; they were used by people
on other floors of the building and we could not disrupt their
functioning]{.underline}. While this is surely reasonable, this concern
about physical safety and functionality blended easily with reoccurring
concerns about the 'content' of the performance and what would happen if
an 'inappropriately gendered' person were detected in the building. For
example, [it was argued that a student might come to the building
Saturday morning and use the elevator to get to the fifth floor to work
on their math homework. It was deemed that this hypothetical student did
not 'sign up' to encounter a drag queen, and while this moment of
unexpected encounter might be the very point of the performance, it was
seen as crossing a boundary]{.underline}. In the same discussion, one
organizer added that he had some information that there was a
'conservative' meteorologist on another floor, and if he encountered the
performance, there would certainly be 'blowback.' Here, a vague
reference to an unspecified person's conservatism (by which we mean
homophobia) was sufficient to cause us to second-guess what was
appropriate at the conference. Here, it is clear how '\[i\]nnuendo,
gossip, \[and\] hearsay... become indispensable forms of knowledge' in
the act of censorship (Tyburczy 2015, 59).

Ultimately, [the potential 'space invasion' posed by both the drag
performance and 'Redbone' were **managed with spatial
tactics**]{.underline}. For safety as well as political reasons, the
drag performers could not use the elevators. [It was resolved that they
could make use of various spaces on the third floor (one of the floors
belonging to the Dept. of Geography), including meeting rooms and other
miscellaneous spaces. It was also suggested that the time and location
of this performance would be clearly marked on a map of the conference
space, presumably so that one could make an informed choice about
attending it or not]{.underline}. This way, one would not unwillingly
encounter a nonnormatively gendered performance artist when they had not
explicitly 'signed up' to do so by attending a critical geography
conference. In the same discussion, it was suggested that the other
controversial piece, 'Redbone,' be sequestered in the graduate student
lounge, while the rest of the works were displayed prominently in the
hallway and that it also be placed on a map, so that people interested
in viewing it could find it (it was later excluded due to code issues).
Here, the map emerged as a key technology in including some works
differently. [Given that the rest of the artworks were all contained in
one stretch of hallway]{.underline} (making a map unnecessary), [we can
wonder if the map was meant to orient visitors to the works and to
render them more visible, or if it was a strategy proposed to hide works
that made political statements, particularly in light of the fact that
the only two works subjected to this treatment were ones concerned
explicitly with gender, sexuality, and race]{.underline}.

These spatial tactics were deemed necessary to avoid offending people,
be they participants in the conference or people who somehow happened to
be in the conference space. At various points, these concerns were
embodied and conjured up in the figure of 'old-school' department
members, conference-going children, conservative meteorologists, and
members of an unspecified, yet seemingly present reactionary polity. The
audience at issue never included us. In all cases, external threats
loomed over the process of including certain works. In retrospect, these
various substitutions projected the discomfort and concern of those
involved onto vaguely defined others, others we could not control or
communicate with rationally, others that would respond with 'blowback.'
It was these others and their conservative political viewpoints that
drew the boundaries of what we could and could not include. [This
tendency to externalize our own fears, racial privilege, and homophobia
onto imaginary others undercut the potential for collective reflection
on the boundaries of critical geographies. If we are concerned about the
future of critical geographies, it is worth reflecting on how this
silence was guaranteed and indeed, rendered apolitical, by our
self-assured status as 'critical geographers.']{.underline}

**[[New methods (of vetting), old forms of
exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**

What these negotiations demonstrate most forcefully is how social
positionalities, [**[relations of authority]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} [**imaginaries of the institution** [and its values
**constrain**]{.mark} potential **[interventions into]{.mark}
disciplinary [space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here, [[decisions about
what]{.underline} '**[belonged']{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the department's **[[intellectual]{.underline}]{.mark}** and physical
[**[space]{.underline}** [were closely sutured to the identities of
those with the power to make such decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
Beisel argues, decisions about if art is appropriate or inappropriate
necessarily draw on 'cultural schema that constitute, and are, in turn,
constituted by social structures' (Beisel 1993) including social
identities, creating real obstacles for marginalized subjects to
intervene in the dominant -- and institutionalized -- ways of imagining
and practicing space and knowledge production. [Here, the label
'controversial' functions as 'a broad category that covers any
representation or visitor experience that upsets the naturalized order
of normalcy,]{.underline}' (Tyburczy 2016, xvi) [serving to police and
reproduce what and who counts as legitimate within the halls of the
department]{.underline}. Given these dynamics, we should not be
surprised that, as scholars in creative geographies have suspected,
[[new forms of]{.mark} vetting and [inclusion]{.mark} indeed [function
to reinforce and maintain hegemonic identities and perspectives]{.mark}
in the field under the guise of commonsense decisions about what is or
is not 'appropriate']{.underline} (de Leeuw and Hawkins 2017).

As this article has argued, a close attention to the dynamics of staging
creative geographies can illuminate the moments in which decisions are
rendered that allow some works to appear and prevent others from being
recognized. [Mundane institutional processes, like the impromptu
functioning of committees, play a critical role in this
process]{.underline}. For example, [abstracts for the **conference**
**underwent** no form of **vetting for political** or **otherwise
controversial content**]{.underline} (they were merely scanned for
content and topically sorted). However, [as soon as a key organizer
learned about the prospect of the drag performance, a meeting was
specifically convened to examine the content of artworks, specifically
the drag performance.]{.underline}

**[[Philippines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not to mention
**[[Bangladesh]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[Brazil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Thailand]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and the **[[United States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Having previously
thought of themselves as Siriono and San, as indios, or even as no more
than residents of a particular region or community, through mapping many
of these groups were becoming indigenous in a novel political sense.
**[Mapping]{.underline}** [[helped foreground **common
struggles**]{.underline} [over]{.underline}
**[land]{.underline}**]{.mark} and resources and cast these [[in terms
of]{.underline}]{.mark} \"**[[territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} \"**[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"
[[recognized as rights]{.underline}]{.mark} through newly developing
legal standards being drafted at the United Nations and the
International Labour Organization (ILO).

The emphasis on legal rights to territory and autonomy echoed calls for
a more sweeping decolonization. In the run-up to the 1992 quin-
centenary of Columbus\'s arrival in the Americas, indigenous organiza-
tions across Latin America made plans for a countercelebration com-
memorating their 500 years of resistance. One of the biggest planning
meetings produced the 1990 Declaration of Quito, which called for the
decolonization of the Americas:

> The existing nation states of the Americas. their constitutions and
> fundamental laws are judicial/political expressions that negate our
> socio-economic, cultural and political rights.
>
> From this point in our general strategy of struggle, we consider it to
> be a priority that we demand complete structural change; change which
> recognizes the inherent right to self-determination throtgh Indians\'
> own governments and through the control of our territories.
>
> Our problems will not be resolved throtgh the self-serving politics of
> governmental entities which seek integration and ethno-development. It
> is necessary to have an integral transformation at the level of the
> state and national society; that is to say, the creation of a new
> nation.\'

The Fourth World envisioned by Nietschmann and George Manuel seemed
close at hand, its contours focused in a profusion of maps depicting
indigenous rights to territory and autonomy.

But the wave of **[[indigenous mapping]{.underline}]{.mark}** that began
in the 1990s [[did not usher in]{.underline}]{.mark} an unprecedented
era of **[[decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead [[it
heralded]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[mainstreaming]{.underline}]{.mark}** of indigenous mapping
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}, above all, a means of **[[governing]{.mark}
what]{.underline}** might otherwise have been an
[[unruly]{.underline}]{.mark} bunch of [[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} and
counterclaims [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} territory and
**[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead of being driven by the aims
and goals of Fourth World nations, [these [projects
were]{.mark}]{.underline}, by and large, [[funded by
NGOs]{.underline}]{.mark}. They were joined by an even more powerful set
of players: the **[[Ford Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the U.S.
Agency for International Development (**[[USAID]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
and the **[[World Bank]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\' In every case, [mapping
provided a means of nominally recognizing indigenous peoples\'
rights]{.underline}, while at the same time assimilating them into a
territorial order whose lines were codified by the law.\'

To understand how this happened, it\'s necessary to see how new mapping
technologies-many of them initially developed for military
applications-facilitated a proliferation of mapping projects. At the
same time its important to see how indigenous mapping fit into the
rather Bowman-esque challenge of fashioning :1 new global political
order fol- lowing the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold
War. But it\'s equally important to see how lines drawn by Cold War
proxy battles in places such as Nicaragua gave shape to the order that
was still to come. This was particularly true for places where
counterinsurgency tactics had broadened beyond armed conflict to engage
peoples\' normative desires for legal protection of their rights, for
development, and peace. All of those desires laid the groundwork for an
order that not only required states to be implemented; they laid the
very basis for the state\'s claims to legitimacy as the guarantor of
stable property rights, of economic growth, and of security.
Counterinsurgency engages these desires, as demonstrated throughout this
book, as a means of imposing a social order that facilitates
distinguishing civilians from combatants and friends from enemies . . .
in the name of more efficiently fighting wars where the perimeters of
the battlefield are socially rather than territorially defined.

As Isaiah Bowman had made clear in his work with The Inquiry during
World War I, organizing space politically according to ethnic identity,
common history, and language provided a means for trans- forming the
boundaries of war into a blueprint for governing. In much the same way,
the World Bank, USAID, and the Ford Foundation, along with countless
other organizations, picked up the techniques of indig- enous mapping by
way of making space gouemable.\' Along the way they transformed the
object of mapping from \"territory\" to \"property,\" replacing the
emphasis on autonomy with the language of markets and the rule of law.5
In short, indigenous mapping was swept into the domi- nant refrain of
capitalism\'s triumph at the end of the Cold War.

Counterrevolution by Other Means

[Central America proved to be pivotal for the mainstreaming of
indigenous mapping]{.underline}. In all accounts, the wars of the 1980s
had left the region in shambles. Their conclusion in the early 1990s did
not bring about peace, but did mark a shift from the violence of
military conflict to that of political and economic restructuring. This
change itself was a legacy of counterinsurgency in the region. Rebranded
by the U.S. military as \"low-intensity warfare,\" counterinsurgency
lowered the emphasis on decisive military victory. Instead, it aimed for
\"a level of internal security that permits economic, political, and
social growth through balanced development programs.\" The doctrine
proved effective at fighting conflicts in which the bat- tlefield
included all of society, weaponizing everything from social divisions to
the procurement of basic needs for food, shelter, and water. Of course,
counterinsurgency did fail to achieve decisive military victories.
Indeed, many of the wars in Central America ended as much because of
cuts in military aid from the United States and the Soviet Union as from
military stalemate and the exhaustion induced by attrition and terror.
The end of armed conflict no more solved the problems than it resulted
in peace. Instead, [it [opened the door for ways of fighting war by
other means]{.mark}, by planning for peace [through]{.mark} ongoing
**[efforts to forge an enduring social order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
From a U.S. policy perspective, this way of waging war by peaceful means
was already at hand in the form of development. Long used to buffer
security during the Cold War, development\'s goal of economic growth
provided a guide for remaking Central America in line with U.S. economic
and security interests.

Nicaragua was the most egregious example of this trend. As a 1991 USAID
report summarizing policy objectives for Nicaragua put it, \"the
strategy presented in this document is an extremely ambitious one. It is
difficult to overemphasize the degree of change in the Nicaraguan
economy and Nicaraguan society which it envisions.\" With former Contra
leaders and their allies in control, this transformation promised a
\"slow-motion counterrevolution\" executed through technocratic reforms
to property rights and the privatization of state assets.\" In
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, USAID officials faced a different
task: one of rehabilitating the legitimacy of states through
development. But in spite of the difference, the goals were similar to
those in Nica- ragua: making use of market-oriented reforms to contain
and neutral- ize political opposition while pursuing regional
unification and inte- gration with U.S. markets. International financial
institutions such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank reinforced the approach, urging states to privatize nationally
owned assets, cut social spending, and stabilize national economies.
Unsurprisingly, none of those efforts guaranteed any semblance of peace.
Instead, they merely forced the region to remake itself in accordance
with U.S. security and economic interests.

This market-oriented vision for rebuilding Central America com- pounded
the threats of dispossession and displacement faced by indig- enous
peoples throughout the region. One of the mandates of structural
adjustment programs directed states to auction off state-owned assets,
including access to natural resources found on so-called national lands.
Historically regarded as national frontiers, states claimed ownership to
these regions due to their lack of identifiable property rights, often
with blatant disregard for indigenous peoples living there. Violence in
these same regions during the 1980s had compounded the displacement of
indigenous peoples, as insurgent groups and proxy forces sought cover in
the dense forests that dominated frontier areas; and the conversion of
these regions to battlefields accelerated the displacement of indigenous
peoples as refugees, emptying them of their occupants and strengthen-
ing perceptions of these areas as \"empty\" national lands.

In addition to the pressure from extractive industries and the strain of
rebuilding lives displaced by war, indigenous peoples throughout the
region faced a third threat from efforts to settle frontier areas
through converting them from forests to farmland. Marching at the head
of this wave were newly demobilized soldiers from insurgent groups and
national armies whose efforts to claim frontier lands brought them into
direct conflict with the indigenous communities living there. As such,
so-called national lands quickly became the focal point for struggles
between competing attempts to bring a sociospatial order to post-war
Central America, pitting newly militant demands for indigenous rights
against state-led development plans. In short, it marked a return to the
standing war that had dominated Central American societies since colo-
nial times. If there was any hope for a peaceful way out of the
predicament, it was going to require an alternative way of valuing
resources and conceiving of social order. And that is precisely \\vhere
Nietschmann\'s call for indigenous maps came in.

conservation through cultural Survival

[In 1992 the National Geographic Society\'s Research and Exploration
journal published a special, bilingual map supplement that proposed just
such an alternative plan for ordering Central America]{.underline}. The
[Coexistence of Indigenous Peoples and Natural Ecosystems in Central
America]{.underline} **[demonstrated]{.underline}** the [coterminous
relationship between]{.underline} **[forests]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the areas in which **[indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** lived, the boundaries of indigenous homelands
coinciding with those of the region\'s remaining forests. In keeping
with National Geographic\'s house style, [[the map was a two- sided
affair]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[One side]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Figure
6.1) [[presented]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[cartographic
\"facts\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the argument, laying natural
ecosystems in a range of greens and blues over a beige-colored \"base\"
map with the boundaries of the seven Central American states: Guatemala,
Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. [[On
top]{.mark} of both [were]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[locations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in shaded black boundaries,
[[of]{.mark} what the map called]{.underline} \"**[[indigenous
territories]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" A trio of inset maps floating over
the blue of the Caribbean chronicled the deforestation of the isthmus,
showing forest coverage for the region in 8000 B.C.l\~2., the 19405, and
from 1987 to 1992. [[The point of the map]{.underline}]{.mark}, as its
title made clear, [[was the relationship between]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[indigenous [territories and]{.mark} natural
[ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially forests. [The map\'s
flipside **reinforced** the **argument** with National
Geographic-quality **photographs** and brief **overviews** of the
indigenous **peoples** and **environment** of each state.]{.underline}

[The map was produced by Mac Chapin, at the time the Central America
Program Director for Cultural Survival]{.underline}. During the 19805,
Cultural Survival had emerged as the leading outlet for advocacy-
oriented work by academics involved with indigenous rights in the
Americas, including Nietschmann. Through the pages of its journal,
Cultural Survival Quarterly, [scholarly contributors wrote about the
various struggles over territory and autonomy that [increasingly defined
\"**indigenous peoples**\" as a **political**]{.mark}, as opposed to an
**anthropological**, **[category]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Maps figured in
that conversation, with Cultural Survival directly contributing to
Miskito land tenure efforts in the early 1980s as participants in the
Polanco map effort we described in the last chapter.

Chapin knew this history personally, having visited communities
throughout Central America in his official capacity at Cultural Sur-
vival. Two decades earlier, he\'d also completed a PhD under cultural
anthropologist Keith Basso, whose interest in place had led him to
experiment with mapping methods.\' But the idea of making a map him-
self didn\'t strike Chapin until 1989 while reviewing a submitted manu-
script on \"Mapping the Distribution of Indians in Central America.\" As
Chapin tells it, the article\'s charting of indigenous populations made
an intriguing match with a National Geographic map that hung on his
office wall showing deforestation in Central America. Chapin admits he
knew next to nothing about how to transform his intuition into a map, so
he turned to Nietschmann for help. Nietschmann quickly latched on to the
idea. In his 1989 book on the Miskito struggle, he\'d already pro- duced
a map showing the \"states and nations of Central America\" IFig- ure
6.2).\" Nietschmann gave Chapin a crash course in cartography and helped
to secure funding for the project from the National Ceographic
Society\'s Committee on Research and Fxploration.

With the National Geographic money in hand, Nietschmann helped Chapin
organize the field teams tasked with gathering data for the map in each
of the seven Central American states. In-country experts headed the
field teams in Guatemala. Belize, and El Salvador, and Nietschmann
personally directed the work in Nicaragua. ln Panama and Honduras,
Chapin turned the task of leading the field teams over to a PhD stu-
dent trained by the lead author of the very article on the distribution
of indigenous populations that had sparked his interest. The student was
Peter Herlihy, the very Herlihy we met mapping the Sierra Juarez in
Chapter I.\"

In spite of Chapin\'s role in producing the map, Nietschmann\'s
intellectual influence on the message was unmistakable. In 1987
Nietschmann published an incendiary article in Cultural Survival
Quarterly that kicked off a two-issue series on \"Militarization and
Indigenous Peoples.\" Nietschmann\'s article drew together the worldwide
struggles of indigenous peoples into what he called \"The Third World
War.\"\'3 Fought continuously since the end of World War II on \"every
continent except Antarctica,\" these \"full-sized little wars\" pitted
state armies against the nation peoples who comprised the Fourth World.
These wars were not to be confused with conflicts between states and
insurgents like the Contras, battling over the control of states.
Insofar as the Contras, like the Sandinistas before them, were bent on
state con- trol, from the perspective of the Fourth World their efforts
amounted to \"colonialism by non-Europeans?\" Fourth World struggles
involved, quite literally, remaking the map of the world and challenged
the dominant geopolitical order imposed by states. Since these wars were
not fought between state forces, they were waged \"without rules,\"
outside the limits of the Geneva Conventions regulating state conflict.

Nietschmann\'s arguments captured the imaginations of fellow Fourth
World advocates. It also caught the attention of former Cold War
warriors scrambling to rethink geopolitical security following the
demise of the Soviet Union. Their interest led Nietschmann to reprise
and amend his arguments. In a return to his background on cultural
ecology, Nietschmann added an environmental element to his argument.
With his \"Rule of Indigenous Environments\" Nietschmann asserted that
\"where there are nation peoples with an intact, self-governed home-
land, there are still biologically rich environments.\" In contrast,
\"state environments\" were \"almost always areas of destructive
deforestation, desertification, massive freshwater depletion and
pollution, and large- scale reduction of genetic-biological
diversity.\"\'5 The 1992 [Research and Exploration map helped solidify
Nietschmann\'s argument by highlighting the coterminous relationship
between indigenous peoples\' territories-nations-and natural
ecosystems]{.underline}. Indeed, Nietschmann repeatedly referred to the
map as demonstrating his rule and holding it out as a blueprint for
decolonization.

But no matter how much the map seemed to demonstrate Nietschmann\'s
rule, its text and images equally lent themselves to a far less radical
reading. Over and against historical readings of indig- enous peoples\'
struggles to secure a place for themselves in the world, the [[emphasis
on their relationship to the environment presented]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**[territories as essential]{.underline}**, **[ecological
truths]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As much as both Nietschmann and Chapin
recognized this tension, the text that accompanied the map
[[emphasized]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[relations[hip]{.mark}]{.underline} [[between]{.underline} **[indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[environment]{.underline}** [as an essential
one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead of pointing to their rights, Chap-
in\'s text portrayed indigenous peoples as victims of colonial
aggression. \"Until recently,\" he wrote, indigenous peoples in Central
America \"had lived in isolation, in regions of refuge, largely
protected from the incur- sion of the outside world by the thick stands
of forest, the heavy rainfall, and generally inhospitable environment\"
that dominates the region\'s Caribbean lowlands. \"Now all this has
changed,\" he continued:

> Since the 1940. exponential population growth throughout Central Amer-
> ica, capitalist schemes utilizing new technologies. and advances in
> public health have combined to open up these areas to exploitation by

> minerals. As all of these forces advance. the forests are cut down and
> burned off at a steadily accelerating pace. and the native inhabitams
> are deprived of their resources. displaced. and driven into cultural
> extinction. 15

Chapin\'s text transformed the map from a blueprint for decolonization
to a proposal for better governing Central America through conservation
and development. It put indigenous peoples at the forefront of this
struggle, but not as nations, as Nietschmann advocated. [Instead it
emphasized their role as conservationists. Chapin underscored this
point, calling for international conservationists \"to form alliances
and to work with local people as a means of solving common problems and
reaching common obiectives\"]{.underline} \'7

### 1NC\-\--Science Good

#### Critical geography is combatible with numbers and scientific paradigms\-\--they throw the baby out with the bath water.

**Schwanen and Kwan 9**, professor in the school of geography @ Oxford;
Geographer @ Chinese University of Hong Kong. (Tim, Mei-Po, 2009,
""Doing" Critical Geographies with Numbers," in The Professional
Geographer, Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group)

[[Criticisms of **quantitative geography**]{.underline} [have a long
history]{.underline}]{.mark} in our discipline. Since the emergence of
early Marxist geography, the advent of new theoretical traditions has
been accompanied by sustained and sometimes vigorous critiques of
spatial analysis (e.g., Harvey 1972; Gregory 1978; Rose 1993; Dewsbury
et al. 2002). Critics often used the terms spatial analysis and
quantitative geography interchangeably to denote the utilization of a
diversity of methods---simple enumeration, statistical analysis,
mathematical modeling, and, more recently, also geographic information
systems (GIS)1---to address (particular sets of) geographical research
questions. Our intention in this introductory article is not to provide
a review of all those critiques in great detail. Instead, [we briefly
discuss the accuracy of some of the criticisms about the use(s) to which
spatial analysis is put and about the philosophical presumptions
underpinning quantitative geographies.]{.underline}

**[[Many critical geographers]{.underline}]{.mark}**---those actively
challenging the multiple processes of oppression and exploitation in
society---have [[pointed out]{.mark} that]{.underline}
[**[statistics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[GIS]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[have been]{.mark} [and]{.mark} still
[are used to sustain]{.mark} and justify [reactionary]{.mark} and
politically conservative interests and [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., Goss 1995; Hannah 2001). **[[There is no
point]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[in antagonistically positioning
**spatial analysis**]{.underline} [as incompatible
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the spirit of **[[critical
geography]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as others have noted, too (Plummer and
Sheppard 2001; Sheppard 2001; Kwan 2004). Moreover, the incompatibility
argument ignores the fact that [[many]{.underline} **[spatial
analysts]{.underline}**]{.mark} have [long since [sought to contribute
to progressive social change through quantitative
research]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Barnes (2009) notes, some of
the most [ardent representatives of]{.underline} the **[spatial
analysis]{.underline}** of the 1960s [hoped to contribute to progressive
politics]{.underline} and a better society [through]{.underline} their
**[mathematical geographies]{.underline}**. Additionally, early work
about women that was classified as feminist empiricism has in many ways
paved the way for later forms of feminist geography (Mattingly and
Falconer-Al-Hindi 1995; Nelson and Seager 2004). **[[Feminist
empiricism]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that strand of feminist scholarship
that [[uses]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[scientific method to
show]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[disregarding
women]{.underline}]{.mark}** and issues of gender [[results in flawed
and biased representations]{.underline}]{.mark} of the world around us
(Harding 1990). The heydays of feminist empiricism arguably fell in the
1980s in geography (e.g., Monk and Hanson 1982), but quantitative
research aimed at "making women visible" remains important to this day
(e.g., Schwanen, Kwan, and Ren 2008; Ren and Kwan forthcoming). Finally,
[the [nascent field of critical GIS]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g.,
Schuurman 2006; Kwan 2007) [[suggests that]{.underline} **[GIS can be
used effectively to challenge oppression and
inequality]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The four articles in this issue
provide further support for the notion that both statistics and GIS can
be mobilized for politically and socially progressive causes.

[Much has been written since the 1960s about the links among philosophy,
methodology, and quantitative methods]{.underline}. Marxist, feminist,
poststructuralist, and other **[[geographers]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
[[criticized]{.underline}]{.mark} the alleged objectivity; the
reductionism; the predisposition toward stability,
**[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, hierarchy, [[and]{.underline}
**[universality]{.underline}**]{.mark}; the idea that science is all
about creating mirror images of a preexisting world (cf. Rorty 1979);
and assumptions about spatiality and temporality thought to be
characteristic of spatial analysis. [[However]{.mark}, [many]{.mark}
geographers have [argued]{.mark} that [such criticisms conflate
quantitative methods with]{.mark} the methodologies and epistemologies
widely known as [positivism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sheppard 2001; Poon
2005).2 [The link between these predispositions and quantitative
analysis is historically contingent---a product of the particular
development of academic geography in the post--World War II
era]{.underline} (Barnes 2001, 2004; Kwan 2004). At the same time, some
critical geographers have become concerned to (re)consider the potential
contributions of counting, statistics, modeling, and GIS to their
projects from the perspectives of critical realism, pragmatism, and
poststructuralism (e.g., Pratt 1989; Jones and Hanham 1995; Pavlovskaya
2006).

Arguably, feminist geographers have interrogated the potentials of
quantitative methods for critical purposes most intensely. The special
issue "Should Women Count?" of The Professional Geographer has played a
key role in this process (Mattingly and FalconerAl-Hindi 1995; Lawson
1995; McLafferty, 1995; Moss 1995; Rocheleau 1995). Feminists have
concentrated in particular on the putatively neutral, detached observer
stance from above---Haraway's (1991, 189) "god-trick of seeing
everything from nowhere"---premised on the "epistemology of the grid"
(Dixon and Jones 1998, 251): the set of procedures that stabilizes,
orders, and segments the social world in such a way that it becomes
distinct from the researcher and can be subjected to analysis. [The
consequences of these premises are profound]{.underline}. For instance,
[the implications of the ways in which researchers see, interpret, and
understand the world from specific embodied locations]{.underline}
(i.e., their positionalities) [for the knowledge production process
become covered up]{.underline}. Those premises also result in
asymmetrical power relations between researchers and the researched.
[[Feminist methodologies]{.mark} for working with any kind of
**method**, including those [**based on numbers**, seek to circumvent
**conventional** **epistemological** arrangements by situating
**knowledge production**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Relevant tactics, such
as [**practicing self-reflexivity** when interpreting outcomes]{.mark}
and the adoption of embodied writing styles, [have]{.mark} also [been
used in]{.mark} **empirical research using GIS and
[statistics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hanson and Pratt 1995; Kwan 2002;
Pavlovskaya 2002, 2004).

Nonetheless, not all quantitative methods are met with equal approval in
feminist circles. Lawson (1995), for instance, considers descriptive
statistics more appropriate for feminist research than inferential
statistics. Lawson and many others have also pointed out that
quantitative techniques are best used for special types of research
problems---for instance, to map the broad contours of inequality and
oppression (McLafferty 1995). This has meant in practice that
quantitative methods (including GIS) are often used in combination with
qualitative methods.

Discussions about the use(fulness) of quantitative methods and GIS for
critical purposes of course extend beyond feminist geography. Two lines
of engagement with quantification can be distinguished. [The first can
be traced in queer geography, studies of race, and studies of natural
resources to name but a few]{.underline} (e.g., Ellis 2001; Brown 2007;
St. Martin this issue). [Work along these lines indicates that numbers
and the stable and stratified ontologies characteristic of conventional
Euro-American thought can be separated from one another]{.underline}.
[It suggests that quantitative geographies can do without the
essentialist categorizations, absolute notions of space and time, and
linear causalities of more conventional spatial analysis.]{.underline}
Rather than having fixed meanings and being instruments to produce
closures, numbers---and visualizations based on numerical
information---are full of potential, "buzzing" and "soft" (cf. Doel
2001): **[[Their meanings can be renegotiated]{.mark}, opened up,
[and]{.mark} thus [reappropriated for socially progressive
causes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Second, [critical geographers
have begun to analyze **geographies of calculation**]{.underline},
[which includes both the purely quantitative and such qualitative
processes as ranking, ordering, and measuring]{.underline} (Crampton and
Elden 2006). Much of this work draws on Foucault's theorizing of the
links of power and knowledge and of governmentality (e.g., Brown and
Knopp 2006; Legg 2006).

The preceding discussion makes it clear that **[[spatial analysis and
critical geographies should not be considered mutually exclusive of one
another]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But neither does this mean that numbers
and critical geographies are entirely comfortable with one another. Some
critical geographers remain deeply suspicious of using statistics and
GIS; others find it difficult to sidestep the legacy of spatial
analysis. Conversely, quite a few analytically inclined geographers
consider critical studies difficult, fuzzy, and based on anecdotal
evidence. [It leaves them "shaking their heads and wondering what is
happening to the rest of their discipline"]{.underline} (Fotheringham
2006, 237).

### 1NC\-\--We Should Care About the Climate

#### We should be pragmatic about the environment! 

**Minteer 12**, PhD, Associate Professor of Environmental Ethics and
Policy in the School of Life Sciences and is a Senior Sustainability
Scholar in the Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State
University (Ben, "Refounding Environmental Ethics," Temple University
Press, p. 35-36)

[Although environmental ethicists may have special skills]{.underline}
that will prove useful in specific public-policy deliberations (e.g.,
semantic sensitivity, the ability to make well-reasoned arguments), [[I
do not believe we have special knowledge of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
moral and [[metaphysical \"truths\" that must govern]{.mark}
communities\' [relationship with]{.mark} their natural and social
[environments]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, **[I do not believe such
absolute truths exist]{.underline}**; [[some strategies are simply
better or worse for achieving]{.underline}]{.mark} democrati- cally
determined [[environmental goals]{.underline}]{.mark}, and there are
more or less adaptive behav- iors and interventions in ecological
systems. [Because we seldom have the epis- temic luxury of knowing what
all these strategies and manipulations are a priori, [we need to assume
an experimental posture toward]{.mark} environmental [ethical argu- ment
and]{.mark} the [search for durable]{.mark} environmental
[policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that promote the values we collectively
choose to pursue as a democratic community. [These
policies]{.underline}---and their ethical
justifications---[are]{.underline}, in turn, [subject to further debate
and modifica- tion as we continue to learn within coupled natural and
social systems and as we absorb the lessons of our policy failures and
successes]{.underline}. Callicott responds to this line of argument by
doubling down on his view of the heroic, foundationalist task of
environmental philosophers, one that sees this kind of work, rather than
the experimental and pragmatic method, as essential to the very
existence of democracy: Environmental philosophers such as Rolston and I
have taken on \... (a) lofty and protracted task. We would like to
contribute to the kind of trans- formation of Western culture and
civilization that philosophers in the past--- such as Locke, Kant,
Bentham, and Mill---have effected\.... Democracy, the political practice
we know and cherish, owes its existence to substantive, foun- dational
philosophical work of the kind that Rolston and I, as well as many other
contemporary environmental philosophers, wish to continue. (2002b,
107-108) In the end, I simply have to conclude that [[environmental
philosophers]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as Callicott, Rolston, and Katz,
see the mission of environmental ethics very dif- ferently than I do.
They [[think]{.underline}]{.mark} it [is to invent
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} substantive
[[metaphysical]{.underline}]{.mark} and moral foundations that [[will
save us]{.underline} [from]{.underline}]{.mark} [our [political
mistakes]{.mark} by philosophically guaranteeing the correct
environmental policy agenda while at the same time [transforming]{.mark}
\"Western culture and [civilization]{.mark}\" into a nonanthropocentric
order]{.underline}. **[[I am wary of such
guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[and the mission of cultural
transformation]{.underline}---and think that [[environmental
philosophers should stick to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [philosophically
more humble (though far from easy) task]{.underline} I describe here:
[the [facilitation of improved methods of inquiry into **specific
environmental problems** and the continual shoring up of]{.mark} the
**democratic social [institutions]{.mark}** [that allow]{.mark} these
**[methods to run free]{.mark} in public life**]{.underline}. Callicott
(1999b) writes that this effectively means I Wish to \"silence
philosophers.\" I do not. I do, however, wish to see philosophical
environmental inquiry become more democratically accountable and more
experimental---and thus more publicly useful. [Otherwise]{.underline}, I
fear that, [[rather than building]{.mark} extensive [coalitions
for]{.mark} collectively agreed upon environmental [policy goals and
working toward]{.mark} the [reconciliation of empirical value
conflicts]{.mark} in critical environmental debates]{.underline},
**[[ethicists will end up only preaching to our own philosophical
choirs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That this would be a most regrettable
development is a conclusion on which I think all of us in environmental
ethics, despite our differences, can agree.

#### Extinction is informed by a shared concern for both settlers and indigenous to continue liberation --- allows material conditions to get better even if nothing else.

[And yet, [something]{.mark} has **[changed]{.mark}** in this landscape
[from]{.mark} the [initial erasures]{.mark} of Native
futurity]{.underline} we drew out in the first chapter. [In the
narratives of colonial actors]{.underline} like Duncan Campbell Scott,
[it was absolutely clear that "Indians" were disappearing because their
social worlds were being [superseded by]{.mark} more "civilized" ways of
living and being, ones that these Native subjects would also,
inevitably, in the end, adopt (or failing that, perish outright). There
was a future. It was **simply [a settler one]{.mark}**. **But the
[nightmare futures]{.mark} of that my Haida interlocutors ward against
in their own future-making reach beyond Haida life alone**.
**Environmental collapse**, most dramatically, **[threaten]{.mark}**s
the sustainability of **[all life]{.mark}**; toxins in the land and the
waters threaten human lives [regardless of]{.mark} their [relative
indigeneity]{.mark}, race, or gender]{.underline} (e.g. Choy 2011; Crate
2011). Put another way, [[the **impetus** for]{.mark} non-Haida (and
[**non-First Nations** subjects]{.mark} more generally) [to be
"united]{.mark} against Enbridge" [with their indigenous neighbours
comes]{.mark} in no small part **[because]{.mark}** an oil spill also
profoundly [threatens the]{.mark} lives and livelihoods of
**[non-Aboriginal]{.mark}** coastal residents]{.underline}, a fact which
Masa Takei, among others, made clear in Chapter 3. Nor is the anxiety
that young people might abandon their small town to pursue economic and
educational advantage in an urban context limited to reserve
communities. Instead, the compulsions of capitalist economic life compel
such migrations throughout the globe. [The **nightmare futures** that
Haida people constitute alternative futures to ward against are **not
just future of indigenous erasure under settler colonialism**. They are
**erasures of settler society itself**]{.underline}.

[There is thus [a]{.mark}n **extraordinary political [claim]{.mark}**
embedded in Haida future-making, a claim [which **gains**]{.mark} **its
[power]{.mark} precisely *[because]{.mark}*** Haida future-making as we
have seen [it]{.mark} does not (perhaps **[cannot]{.mark}**)
**[escape]{.mark} from the larger field of [settler-colonial
determination]{.mark}**. Instead, in Haida future-making we find the
implicit assertion that Haida people [can]{.mark} make futures that
**[address the dilemmas of Haida *and* settler life alike]{.mark}**,
ones that can **[at least "navigate]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} to borrow
Appadurai's phrasing, [**[towards possible futures that do not end in
absolute erasure]{.mark}**. If]{.underline} Povinelli and Byrd are
correct and [settler liberal governance makes itself possible and
legitimate through a perpetual deferral of the problems of the present,
then part of the power of Haida future-making is to **expose the
threatening non-futures that might emerge out of this bracketed
present**, to expose as lie the liberal promise of a good life always
yet to come and to attempt to constitute alternatives]{.underline}.

It is no coincidence that we find this in the midst of a struggle over
sovereignty. And this not just in the sense of the Council of the Haida
Nation's ongoing assertion of its sovereign right to govern the lands
and waters of Haida Gwaii on behalf of all Haida people, as we saw in
Chapter 5. Rather, as Joanne Barker has argued, over the course of the
latter half of the twentieth century sovereignty has emerged as a:
particularly valued term within indigenous scholarship and social
movements and through the media of cultural production. It \[is\] a term
around which analyses of indigenous histories and cultures were
organized and whereby indigenous activists articulate their agendas for
social change (Barker 2005:18). Through the assertion of sovereignty,
indigenous political leaders, activists and scholars refute "the
dominant notion that indigenous people \[are\] merely one among many
'minority groups' under the administration of state social service and
welfare programs." Instead, "sovereignty defines indigenous people with
concrete rights to self-government, territorial integrity, and cultural
autonomy under international law" (18). The trouble is, of course, that
indigenous claims to sovereignty are always made within the context of
colonial nation-states, ones whose own legitimacy is put at considerably
risk both by the prospect of self-determining indigenous Nations
(re)-emerging within their boundaries and the troubling of their own
historical narratives of sovereign rights (cf: Comaroff and Comaroff
2003b). (One of these narratives, which reinterpreted indigenous lands
as terra nullius and thus open to occupation, we've encountered already
in Chapter 3). Thus, while sovereignty might indeed "define" indigenous
peoples with concrete rights to territorial Title and
self-determination, in theory equal under international law to the
states who also lay claim to their territories, that definition does not
in and of itself make possible the practice of this sovereignty. In this
regard settler states such as Canada have shifted in their response to
First Peoples' sovereignty claims from outright rejection to a set of
policies of selective recognition,5 but even the latter still positions
Native nations as being subject to the authority and oversight (if not
the structural forms) of the state. This means, as we have seen in
Chapter 5, that indigenous governments such as the Council of the Haida
Nation are in a precarious position, attempting to constitute their own
sovereign authority without access to many of the conventional means of
sovereignty in Western political thought -- e.g., the monopoly on
legitimate violence (Weber 1946), decisive authority to make and enact
law (Schmitt 2005), or exclusive territorial control (Brown 2010; cf:
Hobbes 1994). Alongside this precarity is the equally anxious question
of whether or not sovereignty is even an appropriate analytical to
center indigenous rights around precisely because it is historically a
Western concept, one that had been drawn on to dispossess indigenous
peoples over the course of settler colonial history (Barker
2005:18--19). (Indeed, the very next essay in Barker's edited volume, by
Mohawk scholar Taiake Alfred, categorically rejects sovereignty as an
inappropriate tool for indigenous political assertions for these reasons
and, also, because it draws attention away from developing and
furthering "genuinely" Aboriginal political modes of thought (Alfred
2005; cf: Alfred 2009). The fact that sovereignty remains such a
preeminent concept in the struggle for indigenous rights even though it
is both epistemologically problematic and politically constrained has
meant that there has been a recent push in both anthropology and
indigenous studies to "widen" the definition of sovereignty, so that it
might encompass multiple forms of indigenous social, political and legal
practice outside of the conventional purview of "sovereign power" (e.g.
Cattelino 2008; Richland 2011; Simpson 2000; Simpson 2014). Or, as
Joanne Barker puts it: There is no fixed meaning for what sovereignty is
-- what it means by definition, what it implies in public debate, or how
it has been conceptualized in international, nation, or indigenous law.
Sovereignty -- and its related histories, perspectives, and identities
-- is embedded within the specific social relations in which it is
invoked and given meaning. How and when it emerges and functions are
determined by the "located" political agendas and cultural perspectives
of those who rearticulate it into public debate or political document to
do a specific work of opposition, invitation, or accommodation. It is no
more possible to stabilize what sovereignty means and how it matters to
those who invoke it than it is to forget the historical and cultural
embeddedness of indigenous peoples' multiple and contradictory political
perspectives and agendas for empowerment, decolonization, and social
justice (Barker 2005:21, emphasis original). The opening up of
sovereignty as flexible, multiple, and subject to all manner of diverse
rearticulations carries particular weight (and, perhaps, ambiguity)
since, as a historical concept in Western political theory, sovereignty
was overwhelmingly concerned with closure. As Wendy Brown argues in her
Walled States, Waning Sovereignty, the classic vision of sovereign power
rests in the capacity to divide the inside from the outside, to make
borders around a people -- a "nation" -- and separate that people from
those outside it. Thus Schmitt's "friend-enemy" distinction, for
instance, or even John Locke's consistent preoccupation with fences as a
way of marking the existence of territory (Brown 2010; cf: Schmitt 1996;
Locke 1988). The historical conditions of indigenous sovereignty claims
in the context of settler colonialism make such absolute closures
impossible for indigenous peoples. We might add, though, that their
persistent presence also challenges the closure of the settler
nation-state. Indeed, this is part of Brown's point. The very fact that
we see ever more spectacular performances of sovereign power on the part
of contemporary nation-states -- e.g., the titular "walls" that are
being constructed along the borders of an increasing number of states -
is a sign of the very insecurity of their political authority (Brown
2010).6 The conditions of settler colonial sovereignty, in other words,
may be rather more "open," and thus closer to those of indigenous
"nation-within-nations," then they may at first appear. If this means,
in turn, that the future of settler political life is becoming as
uncertain as the future for indigenous life has always been since the
advent of settlement, then this means only what we have already begun to
see: the dilemmas that Haida people confront in their future-making
practices are also the dilemmas facing settler society. Take Chapter 4,
in which the absence of any "one" definitive governing entity compels
the constitution of an aspirational framework of accountability which
could, were it realized, render navigable Haida relations to the many
governments that claim their loyalties. As I hinted at there, such
dilemmas are not restricted to the Haida sociopolitical world; rather,
they may in fact be endemic to contemporary democratic societies and the
multiple forms of governance (licit and otherwise) that emerge therein.
In suggesting that there are Haida ways of refiguring a shared
Haida-settler set of contemporary problematics, we might think of Haida
future-making as simultaneously an instantiation of the multiple,
flexible and always contingently located practices of sovereignty to
which Barker points and a different way of thinking about indigenous
political potentiality. In the former sense, Haida future-making is
without doubt concerned with carving out spaces in which Haida existence
can continue, expand, and change without losing the capacity to
reproduce itself as, precisely, Haida existence. Thus the processes of
homecoming we explored in Chapter 2, or Chapter 5's explicitly political
attempts to establish control over the islands for future generations.
If the absence of indigenous sovereignty is the absence of the capacity
of an indigenous people to (self)-determine their own futures, then the
constitution of Haida futures can be seen exactly as sovereign work,
whether in the overt sense of the Council of the Haida Nation's
assertions or the somewhat more implicit mode of Alice Stevens' proposed
mass adoptions. Significant here, though, is the fact that these acts of
future-making carry meanings beyond their status as "responses" to the
social and political dilemmas of contemporary Haida life. Thus Alice
Stevens' adoptions bring "hippie" children into the framework of Haida
kinship relations, in one sense neutralizing their potential threat, but
also constituting a complex new network of social relations between
Haida and non-Haida whose potential significances go well beyond the
protection of Haida territory and resources; thus the Council of the
Haida Nation emerges as a "state-like" governing entity through its
authorizing promise to "take care" of the islands, but in so doing takes
on a series of new roles in Haida political life whose full consequences
remain to be seen. If it is a sovereign action to envision an opening of
possible futures for Haida people, then this very openness might also
exceed the boundaries of sovereignty as a problematic for indigenous
people even as it responds to them. Which is also, perhaps, why Haida
futures seem so consistently to sketch out social, ecological, and
political fields that encompass non-Haida; more, that are futures for
Canada as well as for the Haida people living within the nation-state's
borders. Or, at least, futures that have the capacity to be so. What
would it mean to figure an indigenous sovereignty that speaks beyond
itself, one that promises to invert the order of settler domination
through reconfiguring the shared futures of indigenous and settler
peoples? This would not be a sovereignty premised on territorial
closure, or even absolute political autonomy. It would, however,
decisively overturn any settler colonial anticipations of the inevitable
erasure of Native peoples. Quite the opposite, it would position
indigenous practices of anticipation, aspiration, certainty, and anxiety
at the forefront of contemporary modes of political imagination.
Unsettling Futures

[A question remains, however. Could **[such a refiguring of the
temporal]{.mark} and political [horizon of]{.mark} settler and
indigenous [relationships remain possible even if]{.mark} the
[futures]{.mark} that indigenous people work to constitute [remain
unrealized in the settler colonial present]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Or,
put another way, we must always be careful not to conflate a capacity
*to* form new futures for settler nation-states with the actual
materializations of these futures. [The Haida futures that I have
discussed, even as they promise possible ways of navigating -- of
restructuring, even -- the settler-Haida present, remain firmly bound by
the colonial constraints of this present. But perhaps [the stakes here
have **never been about overthrowing**]{.mark} **the**]{.underline}
Canadian [**colonial order [outright]{.mark}**.
[Rather]{.mark}]{.underline}, what I hope this dissertation has shown is
that [Haida future-making **[has the capacity to *unsettle* the settler
colonial present]{.mark}**, to challenge its received categories and
demonstrate how, slowly, gradually, Haida people are reconfiguring its
terms through the work of producing the future]{.underline}. Certainly,
the sheer fact of Haida futurity should put to the lie any further
notion that Haida people exist only to replicate their past or live only
in the deferral of their eventual disappearance. The future is alive and
well in Old Massett, although this does not meant that it is not also a
site of profound anxieties. [In working to ward off]{.underline} those
[anxieties through the juxtaposition of nightmare futures against their
more desirable alternatives, then, Haida people unsettle the
epistemological foundations of]{.underline} the [forms of settler
colonialism and liberalism]{.underline} against which Byrd and Povinelli
write. [At the same time]{.underline} (if you'll pardon the pun), I
think [we can see the social work that futuremaking does iteratively, as
a gradual reshaping of the actual conditions of]{.underline} Canadian
[society]{.underline}. Here I borrow Judith Butler's suggestion,
following Foucault, that the regulatory norms of society function only
through their consistent and unstable reiteration (and materialization)
in everyday social life.7 From this perspective, [the [ways in which
Haida]{.mark} people **[work within]{.mark} and even reiterate the
constraints and demands of**]{.underline} Canadian [**[settler]{.mark}
mainstream [society]{.mark}** [can **also slowly and strategically
*shift***]{.mark} **those very [constraints and demands, materializing
a]{.mark}**]{.underline} HaidaCanadian **[[future]{.mark} that might in
fact be [quite different from the present even as it does not ever fully
"escape"]{.mark} from its dilemmas]{.underline}**. Perhaps [the most
unsettling potential of all here lies simply in the ways in which Haida
people **[incorporate the]{.mark} conditions of [the]{.mark} settler
colonial [present as]{.mark} being [paths towards Haida
futures]{.mark}**. Not vanished, or vanquished. Ongoing]{.underline}.

### 1NC\-\--Research Fails

#### Research does not challenge the university. 

**Webb 18**, Senior Lecturer in Education at the University of Sheffield
(Darren, 2018, "Bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the system: On forms
of academic resistance (or, can the university be a site of utopian
possibility?)," Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies,
40:2, 96-118)

But let us acknowledge the limitations. A seminar, **[[an undergraduate
module]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Masters program---these are going to
[[do little to challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[corporate]{.mark}-imperial [university]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
utopian educator may work hard to protect their autonomous learning
spaces, and to make these sites for experiments in new forms of thought
and practice, but [we should not overestimate their transformative
potential]{.underline}. Here I note **[four limitations]{.underline}**
to the utopian classroom:

**[[Firstly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there is often a [profound
[disjuncture between]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[claims]{.underline}]{.mark}** [made on behalf of a **particular
program**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[project]{.underline}**
[[and]{.mark} the [realities]{.mark} of its enactment]{.underline}. Mike
Neary's "student-as-producer," for example, sought "to design an
alternative model for the university, as a rehearsal for an alternative
social world within which it might subsist" (Neary 2010). Informed by
Marx, Benjamin, Lefebvre, Debord, and others, student-as-producer
"brings revolutionary pedagogy to life" and prefigures a postcapitalist
society characterized by "from each according to their abilities" (Neary
2012a, 5--6). [On paper, then, it seems that Neary---occupying a
position of power as Dean of Teaching and Learning at the University of
Lincoln between 2007--2014---was creating a transformative utopian space
in every classroom across the entire campus]{.underline}. The reality,
however, was somewhat more modest. [Beneath]{.underline} the [endless
references to [radical thinkers]{.mark}]{.underline} past and present,
what [student-as-producer]{.underline} **[actually did]{.underline}**
[was **[enhance]{.mark}** the **[research]{.mark} component** of the
undergraduate curriculum]{.underline} (Neary 2014) [[while being]{.mark}
pragmatically]{.underline} "[**[mindful]{.underline}** [of the need for
the university to survive]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
prosper"]{.underline} (Neary 2010). A worthwhile endeavor certainly, but
**[hardly]{.underline}** a **[revolutionary]{.underline}** project
prefiguring post-capitalist society. The field of critical
pedagogy/radical education is heavy on bombast and the realities of the
utopian classroom often [fall short of the theory-heavy
promises]{.underline}.6

**[[Secondly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a focus on the classroom as the
site of utopian practice is sometimes [accompanied by]{.underline} a
**[simplistic]{.underline}** model of **[[social
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even in its most revolutionary
formulations---in the work of Paula Allman (2001), for example---the
classroom [[interactions]{.underline}]{.mark} of the utopian educator
[are [directed towards transforming]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[individual
consciousness]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[assumed]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[enlightened
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, newly conscientized, [[will leave
the classroom and]{.underline}]{.mark} somehow
**[[bring]{.underline}]{.mark}** about **[social
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lissovoy 2009, 198; Cho 2013, 94). At
its worst, utopian pedagogy shares the quasi-colonial understanding of
change typical of the corporate-imperial university. Wink, for example,
tells us that radical pedagogy "starts in the classroom but goes out
into the community to make life a little better" (Wink 2011, 24).
Darder, too, talks about an emancipatory pedagogy that seeks to "reach
beyond the boundaries of the classroom into communities, workplaces, and
public arenas" (Darder 2009, 158). [Here we have a process [akin
to]{.mark} the manifold **["outreach" activities]{.mark}** undertaken by
higher education institutions, through which [communities are blessed by
interventions]{.mark} from the academy, "**reaching out**" to make their
lives a little better, [in]{.mark} a **[contemporary]{.mark} form** of
**[noblesse oblige]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Seybold 2008).

**[[Thirdly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [corporate-imperial [university
draws strength from the utopian classroom]{.mark}]{.underline}, happily
**[[accommodating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [sites of [resistance]{.mark}
in order [to recuperate]{.mark} them as **[symbols of]{.mark} its
[tolerance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Oparah 2014). The utopian classroom
might be seen as "a release-valve for intellectual dissonance ...
supervised by its very enemies" (Inoperative Committee 2011, 4). A
release valve because, as Michael Apple has long complained, radical
pedagogy is often adopted to resolve personal crises brought about by
the "contradictory class location" of academics who want to portray
themselves as politically engaged (2013, 14). [**[Spaces]{.mark} of
experimentation** within the academy may [have]{.mark} as much to do
with "[a]{.mark} certain **[ritual of self-display]{.mark}**" as they do
with **any** form of **genuine commitment** to **social
transformation**]{.underline} (Ĉiĉigoj, Apostolou-Hölscher, and Rusham
2015, 272). Students, too, are aware that **["[radical"
courses]{.mark}]{.underline}** on campus [[serve as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[vaccination]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [against
future outbreaks of radicalism in society at large]{.underline} (Anon
2010c, 32). As one group put it: "[A taste of the poison serves well [to
inoculate us against any confrontational
radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Anon 2010b, 15). This release of
dissonance is supervised by its enemies in the simple but very real
sense that contemporary university governance includes so that it can
control (De Nicola and Roggero 2011, 36).

**[[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [[utopian classroom will never
be anything more than]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[fringe
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be tolerated at the margins. The
university, of course, is hostile to radical learning spaces "trying to
establish outcomes contrary to the logic of the market" (Albert 2007,
324). It is well noted that **[critical/ radical/utopian
[spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}** within the academy [[are
shrinking]{.underline}]{.mark} (Shear 2008, 56; Canaan 2013; Amsler
2015, 169, Lawrence 2015) and that
**[[departments]{.underline}]{.mark}** offering perspectives challenging
the mainstream **[[risk closure]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Seybold 2008,
117--118; Adsit et al. 2015, 22). [It is also worth highlighting that
the [utopian university is unviable in the absence of wider systemic
change because]{.mark}, quite simply, "any [university]{.mark} that
operated along these lines [would quickly become irrelevant to the vast
majority of people who need an education]{.mark} that provides them with
a better chance of finding work]{.underline}" (Holmes and Research and
Destroy and Dead Labour 2011, 13). The utopian classroom, then, [will
remain a novelty to be **controlled**]{.underline} within the
corporate-imperial university. [And "as long as the radical is in the
minority, as long as the radical is unable to drive campus culture,
nothing is threatened"]{.underline} (Prashad 2014, 330).

#### Critical accounts of [research]{.underline} fail to articulate [meaningful alternatives]{.underline} and [sustain struggle]{.underline}\-\--focusing on the [material]{.underline} is necessary.

C. The Limits of Critique

The first thing that needs to be said about these [[critical accounts
of]{.mark} human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} is that they raise
crucially important and valid critiques of dominant liberal discourses
of human rights. With that said, these critiques also **[[fall
short]{.underline}]{.mark}** in several important ways. Three of the
[[main shortcomings]{.underline}]{.mark} in these critiques
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}: (i) the [[overemphasis on the **dominant
narrative**]{.underline}]{.mark} of human rights; (ii) the
**[[idealistic nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the critiques (in the
sense that they are, in the first instance, an engagement with and
critique of ideas and concepts [in the abstract]{.underline});
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (iii) the [[divorce]{.underline}]{.mark} of
this critique **[[from concrete struggles]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Each]{.underline}]{.mark} of these shortcomings, more pronounced in
some cases than others, reduces these critical accounts to a sort of
radical quietism; a stance which [[decries the]{.underline} **[extant
order]{.underline}**, [without conceiving]{.underline}]{.mark} or
countenancing **[[any meaningful alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The indeterminacy critique, highlighting the atavistic forms of
individuality at the heart of mainstream accounts of human rights and
the cynical deployment of human rights to justify imperialist
depredations, are all valid. [[The problem]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[is when]{.underline}]{.mark} these [legitimate
[critiques]{.mark}]{.underline} of liberal/dominant rights discourses
[[evolve into]{.mark} a **[rejection]{.mark} of rights**]{.underline} as
such.

It is undeniable, as Blackburn puts it, that human rights are cynically
deployed for "greatpower ends,"91 that liberal rights discourse
entrenches a truncated form of individuality,92 and that rights are not
the neutral, determinate rules that liberal legalism pretends they
are.93 [[All of this]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, merely demonstrates
the inaccuracy of the self-perception of dominant human rights
discourses, and [[says]{.underline}]{.mark} little or [[nothing about
how movements]{.mark} striving for]{.underline} fundamental social
**[change]{.underline}** can or [[should engage]{.mark} with
the]{.underline} **[language and concept of
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}** as such. Tied to this one-sidedness is
the idealistic character of these rights critiques. In a rather scathing
manor, Anthony Chase highlighted this shortcoming in the context of the
first wave CLS critique of rights in the 1980s. As Chase sardonically
put it:

> [[Nothing is more striking]{.underline}]{.mark} about the literary
> criticism approach [[than]{.underline}]{.mark} the

Though caustic, Chase's insight is valid and important. [[It is
not]{.mark} the [language]{.mark} of]{.underline} human
**[rights]{.underline}** [[that sustains]{.mark} the]{.underline} extant
**[social [order]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though it can and does play a
part in the broader ideological apparatus, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[an array of [material relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[Critiques]{.mark} of rights]{.underline} in the broad CLS tradition
routinely lose sight of this, and [[become trapped in a hall of mirrors
where the enemy is a discourse, rather than]{.mark} the [material
relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} that structure discourses one way or
another.95

Finally, then, [[these critiques are]{.underline}]{.mark} lacking
because they are [**[divorced from]{.underline}**]{.mark} concrete
[struggles and]{.underline} the **[[ideas which animate]{.mark} such
[struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So, for example, it is true to say
that rights can have myriad different meanings in the abstract, but in
concrete cases they are given a specific meaning. [This meaning is
fought over and determined in and through social struggles]{.underline},
which sometimes make their way to the rarefied environs of the
courtroom, but are not limited to this. [The [critique of
rights]{.mark}, in the abstract, [loses]{.mark} much of its
[veracity]{.mark} and efficacy [when]{.mark} the [messiness of]{.mark}
political and social [struggles have to be accounted
for]{.mark}]{.underline}. One way, then, in which the shortcomings of
human rights, rightly highlighted by these critiques, can be addressed,
is through embracing a substantive political or social vision of change.
As Morton Horwitz argued, [the "most promising way]{.underline} to
ensure that rights may be used on behalf of the socially weak, and to
mitigate . . . undesirable long-term risks of rights conceptions, [is to
ground rights theory in a substantive conception of the good
society."]{.underline}96

In a similar vein, Karl Klare, reflecting on the CLS tradition after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall, argued that "[perhaps the best conclusion
is that [rights **discourse** needs to be **transformed**, not
**abandoned**]{.mark}; that its **individualism** should be **tempered**
by an **infusion of communitarian** and egalitarian **values**; and that
rights discourse must be made more sensitive to issues of gender and
cultural difference]{.underline}."97 Divorced from concrete struggles
and visions of an alternative world, critiques of rights end up
accepting, much like the theories they critique, the extant, capitalist
order as their perennial premise.98 In the next section, we will see
how, by shifting our understanding of rights and situating it within the
broader, emancipatory theory of Marxism, it is possible to mobilize the
language of rights without succumbing to the siren call of liberal
legalism.

Resistance, and Criticism: A Response to Sloop and Ono," vol. 32)

My [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} with this movement [[centers
around]{.underline}]{.mark} an issue that Sloop and Ono seem to take as
a given, [namely]{.underline}, **[the role of [the
critic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On one hand, calling for the systematic
investigation of existing marginalized discourses is a natural extension
both of critical rhetoric (see McKerrow 1989, 1991) and of the general
ideological turn in criticism (see Wander 1983). On the other hand, the
ease of transition from criticism in the service of resistance to
criticism of resistance may obscure the need to address some fundamental
issues regarding the general function of rhetorical criticism in an
uncertain and contentious world. Beyond licensing the critic to engage
in political struggle, Sloop and Ono advocate the pursuit of covert
resistant discourses.

Such a move not only stretches our understanding of rhetoric and
criticism, but also alters significantly the relationship between critic
and outlaw. [Critical interrogation of dominant discursive practices in
the service of political/cultural reform is supplanted in favor of
positioning covert outlaw communities as **objects** of
**investigation**. Invited to seek out subversive discourses, [the
**critic** is positioned as]{.mark} the **[active agent]{.mark} of
change** and the out-law **discourse** becomes merely
**instrumental**]{.underline}. Rather than academic criticism acting in
service of everyday acts of resistance, everyday acts of resistance are
put into the service of academic criticism.

Rhetorical resistance

That we are \"caught within conflicting logics of justice that are
culturally struggled over\" (Sloop and Ono 1997, 50) and that rhetoric
is employed in these struggles seems an uncontroversial statement.
Despite the theoretical miasma surrounding judgment, Sloop and Ono
accurately note, the material process of rendering judgments (and of
disputing the logics of litigation) continues in the world of actually
practiced discourse. In the materially contested world, rhetoric is
utilized both by those seeking to secure the grounds of dominant
judgment and by those seeking to undermine or supplant dominant cultural
logics with some out-law notion of justice.

The distinction between these two cultural groups, \"in-law\" and out-
law, however, deserves some consideration prior to any discussion of the
role of the critic as implied in the out-law discourse project. The
discourse of the dominant or those within the bounds of superordinate
logics of litigation is reminiscent of Michel De Certeau\'s (1984)
strategic discourse. For De Certeau, strategies are utilized by those
who have authority by virtue of their proper position. Strategies
exploit the institutionally guaranteed background consensus by which
power relations (and litigations) are maintained and advanced. In
contrast, tactics are utilized by those having no proper place of
authority within the discursive economy who must seek opportunities
whereby the discourse of the dominant might be undermined and contested.
To extend Sloop and Ono\'s definition, out-law discourses are those that
can (and, by their analysis, do) take advantage of situations (e.g.,
race riots) to disrupt the regularity of dominant cultural groups.

The ongoing struggle between strategically instituted cultural dominants
and the \"out-law always lurk\[ing\] in the distance\" (66) is
acknowledged, even celebrated, by Sloop and Ono. [What their
[acknowledgment fails to provide]{.mark}, however, is [a]{.mark} clear
[need for critical intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, quite
**[[the reverse is presented]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [It is [the
critic]{.mark}]{.underline} (particularly the left-leaning critic) [who
[needs out-law discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the struggles over
justice, equality, and freedom have gone on, [the left-leaning critics
are those who have theoretically excluded themselves from the
disputes]{.underline}. The study of out-law dis- courses, then, provides
a means to reinvigorate the intellectual and re-institute (academic)
leftist thinking into popular political struggles (53-54). Thus, [Sloop
and Ono\'s project incorporates three types of rhetoric: the rhetoric of
the in-law, presumably the traditional object of critical attention; the
rhetoric of the out-law, the study of which may transform our
understanding of judgment as well as reinvigorate leftist democratic
critiques; and the [rhetoric of the critics]{.mark} who, having
[lost]{.mark} their political [potency]{.mark}, [can exploit]{.mark} the
discourse of the out-law to promote [ideological
struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is to this critical rhetoric that I
now turn.

Resistance criticism

Sloop and Ono (1997) clearly state the relationship they envision
between the rhetorical critic and out-law discourse: \"Ultimately, we
will argue that the role of critical rhetoricians is to produce
\'materialist conceptions of judgment,\' using out-law judgments to
disrupt dominant logics of judgment\" (54; emphasis added). Here the
critic seeks out vernacular discourse (60), focuses on the methods and
values embodied in these communities (62), listens to and evaluates the
out-law community (62-63), and chooses appropriate discourses for the
purpose of disrupting dominant practices (63). Essentially, it is the
critic who seeks out marginalized discourses and returns them to the
center for the purpose of provoking dominant cultural groups (63).

Despite acknowledging the efficacy of out-law discourses, Sloop and Ono
assume that the critiques generated and presented by the out-law
community have only minimal effect. The irony, and indeed arrogance, of
this assumption is evident when they claim: \"There are cases, however,
when, without the prompting of academic critics, out-law discourses
serve local purposes at times and at others resonate within dominant
discourses, disrupting sedimented ways of thinking, transforming
dominant forms of judgment\" (60; emphasis added). Sloop and Ono seem to
suggest that such locally generated critiques are the exception, whereas
the political efficacy of the academic critic is the rule. This seems an
odd claim, given that the justification for their out-law discourse
project is the lack of politically viable academic critique and the
perceived potency of out-law conceptions of judgment. [Their suggestion
that out-law communities are in need of the academic critic contradicts
not only the already disruptive nature of existing out-law
discourses]{.underline} (the grounds for using out-law discourse), but
also the impotence of contemporary critical discourse (the warrant for
studying out-law discourse).

By this I do not mean that the critiques and theories generated by
academically instituted intellectuals have not been incorporated into
subversive discourses. Just as out-law discourses inevitably mount
critiques of dominant logics, so, too, the perspectives on rhetoric and
criticism generated by academics are used in resistance movements.
Feminist critiques of patriarchy, queer theories of homophobia,
postcolonial interrogations of race have found their way into the
service of resistant groups. The key distinction I wish to make is that
the existence of criticism (academic or self-generated) in resistance
does not necessitate Sloop and Ono\'s move to a criticism of resistance.

What Sloop and [Ono [fail to offer]{.mark} is an [adequate argument
for]{.mark} \"[taking public speaking out of the streets and studying it
in the classroom]{.mark}, for treating it less as an expression of
protest\"]{.underline} (Wander 1983, 3) [and more as an object for
analysis and reproduction within the political economy of the
academy]{.underline}. Philip Wander made a similar charge against
Herbert Wicheln\'s early critical project, and this concern should
remain at the forefront of any discussion aimed at expanding the scope
and function of criticism. Sloop and Ono offer numerous directives for
the critic [without addressing whether the critic should be examining
out-law discourses in the first place]{.underline}. While it is too
early to suggest any definitive answer to the question of criticism of
resistance, some preliminary arguments as to why critics should not
pursue out-law discourses can be offered:

\(1\) Hidden out-law discourses may have good reasons to stay hidden.
Sloop and Ono specifically instruct us that \"the logic of the out-law
must constantly be searched for, brought forth\" (66) and used to
disrupt dominant practices. But [[are we to believe]{.underline}]{.mark}
that all out-law discourses are prepared to mount such a challenge to
the dominant cultural logic? Or, indeed, that the
**[[members]{.underline}]{.mark}** of out-law communities [[are prepared
to be brought into the arena of public surveillance]{.mark} in the
service of **reconstituting logics of litigation**]{.underline}? It
seems highly unlikely that all divergent cultural groups have developed
equally, or that all members of these groups share Sloop and Ono\'s
\"imperial impulse\" (51) to promote their conceptions and practices of
justice.

\(2\) Academic critical discourse is not transparent. Here I allude to
the overall problem of translation (see Foucault 1994; Lyotard 1988;
Lyotard and Thebaud 1985; Zabus 1995) as an extension of the previous
concern. Critical discourse cannot become the medium of commensurability
for divergent language games. Are we to believe that the \"use\" of
out-law dis- course by critics to disrupt dominant practices can fail to
do violence to these diverse/divergent logics? Are out-law discourses
merely tools to be exploited and discarded in the pursuit of returning
leftist academic dis- course to the center?

\(3\) Perhaps the academic translation of out-law discourse could be
true to the internal logic of the out-law community. And, [perhaps the
re-presentation of out-law logic within the academic community will
bestow a degree of **legitimacy**]{.underline} on the out-law community.
[Nonetheless, [the effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of legitimizing out-law
discourse **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** unknown and potentially
[[destructive]{.underline}]{.mark}. In an effort [[to
siphon]{.underline}]{.mark} the political
**[[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** of out-law discourse [[into academic
practice, we]{.underline}]{.mark} may ultimately [[destroy
the]{.underline}]{.mark} dissatisfaction that serves as a
**[[cathexis]{.underline}]{.mark}** for these out-law discourses. It
seems possible [that **[academic recognition]{.mark}**]{.underline}
might [[take]{.mark} the [place of **struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[for material opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Fraser 1997).
[But, will [academic legitimation create]{.mark} any [material changes
in the **conditions of** out-law **communities**]{.mark}]{.underline}? I
mean to suggest, not that it is better to allow the out-law community to
suffer for its cause, but rather that **[[incorporating]{.mark} the
[struggle into]{.mark}]{.underline}** an (admittedly) impotent
[**[academic critique]{.underline}** [does not
offer]{.underline}]{.mark} [a prima facie
**[alternative]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\(4\) Criticism of resistance denies the practical and theoretical
importance of opportunity. Returning to De Certeau\'s notion of tactics,
the crucial element of these discursive moves is their use of
opportunity to disrupt the proper authority of the dominant. The kairos
of intervention provides the key to undermining \"in-law\" discourses.
But when is the \"right moment in time\" for the academic reproduction
of out-law discourse? Mapping the points of resistance (ala Foucault and
Biesecker) entails interrogating \"in-law\" discourses for their
incongruities and contradictions, not turning the academic gaze upon
those communities waiting for an opportunity. Out-laws do not lurk in
the forefront (66), hoping to be exposed by academic critics; they wait
for the right moment for their disruption. Rhetoricians can provide
rhetorical instructions for seeking opportunities and for exploiting
these opportunities (literally making the culturally weaker argument the
stronger), but this does not justify interrogating (intervening in) the
cultural logics of the marginalized.

The concerns raised here are not designed to dismiss Sloop and Ono\'s
provocative essay. The divergent critical logic they outline deserves
careful consideration within the critical community, and it is my hope
that the concerns I raise may help to further problematize the
relationship between resistance and rhetorical criticism.

Rhetorical criticism

As I have suggested, my purpose is to use the provocative nature of
Sloop and Ono\'s project to extend disputes regarding the ends of
rhetorical criticism. Diverging perspectives on the ends of criticism
have been categorized by Barbara Warnick (1992) as falling along four
general lines: artist, analyst, audience, and advocate. Leah Ceccarelli
(1997) discerns similar categories around the aesthetic, epistemic, and
political ends of rhetorical criticism.

The out-law discourse project presents clear ties to the notion of
critic as advocate. For Sloop and Ono, the critic is an interested
party, discerning (and at times disputing) the underlying values and
forces contained within a discourse. Additionally, however,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} out-law discourse [[critic
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an analyst [[focusing on the
hidden]{.underline}]{.mark}, aberrant [[texts]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the out-law **[[and
\"rendering]{.underline}]{.mark}** an incoherent or esoteric text
**[[comprehensible]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" (Warnick 1992, 233). Now, I
am not suggesting that a critic must serve only one function or that the
roles of advocate and analyst are mutually exclusive; rather, these
entanglings of power (political ends) and knowledge (epistemic ends) are
inevitable. My concern is that we not neglect the complexity of these
entanglements. [Turning covert out-law discourses into objects of our
analyses [runs the risk of subjecting them]{.mark} both [to]{.mark} the
[gaze of]{.mark} the [dominant and]{.mark} to the [power relations of
the academy]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the works of Michel Foucault
(especially 1979, 1980) aptly illustrate, practices presented as
extending such noble goals as emancipation and humanity may endow
institutions of confinement and objectification. Any justification for
studying out-law dis- course because doing so may extend our political
usefulness in the pursuit of emancipatory goals must not obscure the
already existing power relations authorizing such studies. Our attempts
to extend our domains of knowledge and expertise (authority) must not be
pursued unreflexively.

\*Italics in original

Substantively, Norfolk seeks this Court\'s endorsement of City of
Chester\'s ownership litmus for transportation utilities. Norfolk
believes that the ownership focus arises out of Section 2702(a) of the
Public Utility Code, which establishes the PUC\'s jurisdiction over
rail-highway crossings in the first instance, *see* 66 Pa.C.S. §
2702(a), and in light of which, Norfolk asserts, Section 2704(a) must be
read. Norfolk contends that [[Section 2702(a) limits]{.mark} the PUC\'s
[jurisdiction to]{.mark} allocate costs associated with crossing
projects only to a transportation utility which has constructed \"[its
facilities]{.mark}\" across a highway or where a highway has been
constructed across \"the facilities of any such public
utility]{.underline},\" 66 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a). *See* Brief for Norfolk at

County presaged, Norfolk relies upon this Court\'s conclusion in
*Pittsburgh Railways* that \"\[t\]he transportation utilities

at 428, 161 A. at 424 (\"It is the presence and ownership of the track

this line of authority.

### 1NC\-\--Arctic Debates Good

#### Debates about arctic policy changes are [valuable]{.underline} for student skills, critical thinking, and ethical self-reflexivity. 

**Essex 24**, Department of Political Science @ University of Windsor.
(Jamey, 2024, "Coming in from the Cold: Arctic Council Debate Simulation
and the Political Geographies of a Global Region," The Geography
Teacher, Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group)

Liberal and realist theories---and the **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
between them--- have dominated the field of IR for decades and strongly
[[shaped]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[how we
understand]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[international state
system]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} states as territorial
and sovereign actors but also the actual practice of
**[[statecraft]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the makeup and operation of
many international institutions (Snyder 2004). The scenario exercise
described in more detail below, which builds from tensions between
realism and liberalism in institutions such as the Arctic Council, was
developed in the context of a senior seminar for university
undergraduate IR students. It is here, though, that geographic
perspectives on the international system, and the Arctic as a kind of
place, help complicate the liberal-realist dichotomy that dominates much
of IR thinking and that often presents geographic space in static ways.
Changes in the nature of the state and the conduct of international
relations together with economic globalization, climate change, and the
reemergence of nationalism have all challenged realist and liberal
notions of state sovereignty and territory. [This]{.underline} has
prompted a "**[spatial turn]{.underline}**" in the disciplines of
Political Science and IR, as scholars in those fields [have tried to
take spatial relations and geographic organization and representation
more seriously]{.underline}. Yet Clark and Jones (2013, 306; see also
Jones and Clark 2020) argue that attempts at working across disciplinary
divides often still founder on a basic sense of space as "an abstract,
uniform, featureless medium upon which human political action is played
out" [rather than building]{.underline} an understanding of [space and
geography as]{.underline} **[constitutive elements]{.underline}** [of
**international political relations**]{.underline}. Taking for granted
states as territorial units exercising sovereignty through
administration and defense of clearly bounded national space remains a
bedrock of mainstream IR theories.

By contrast, [[political geographers]{.underline}]{.mark} have attempted
to understand and **[[critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
[[taken-for-granted]{.underline}]{.mark} notions of
[**[sovereignty]{.underline}** [based in state
territory]{.underline}]{.mark} for at least three decades. Agnew's
(1994, 58) work on the "territorial trap" in Political Science and IR
approaches is most useful here, and in this he argues that "three
contextual factors have interacted to reproduce the dominant view about
state territoriality" that limits these disciplines' ability to
understand shifts in sovereignty and the state's basis in territorial
control. [These are]{.underline}, first, a "**[preference]{.underline}**
[for abstract]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
'**[closed-system']{.underline}** [thinking among advocates of a
scientific (positivist) approach]{.underline}" that takes the
territorial state as the pregiven basic unit of analysis; second, the
"muddling of two terms, state and nation" in a way that "endows the
territorial state with the legitimacy of representing and expressing the
'character' or 'will' of the nation"; and finally, an "intellectual
division of labour" that dates to the First World War and that too
neatly separates the international arena and domestic politics as
different areas of study and practice (Agnew 1994, 58--59). While some
Political Science and IR scholars (Ethington and McDaniel 2007; Kadercan
2015; Kristensen 2015; see also Murphy 1999; O\'Loughlin 2018; Jones and
Clark 2020) have tried to incorporate a more geographically nuanced
approach, [these three traits continue to shape how these fields see the
state, territory, and the conduct of international affairs.]{.underline}

[**[Political]{.mark}** and environmental
**[changes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the Arctic Council itself,
[[provide]{.mark} a [useful case for exploring]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[interplay between disciplines]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[challenges to narrow]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[territory-based
[understandings of the state as]{.mark} a [kind of political actor
contending with]{.mark} contemporary global
[issues]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Geographer Klaus Dodds (2018, 191) noted
in explaining the concept of the "global Arctic" that the northern polar
region "is not ... imagined to be a regional container with hard
boundaries but rather something created by the intersection of
territories and flows," the kind of place that makes borders hard to
demarcate and police while also disrupting rigid concepts of national
security. [Much of this need to rethink security and sovereignty in the
Arctic stems from the environmental processes at work in the region,
which is both a setting for some of the more extreme consequences of
climate change]{.underline} (e.g., rapidly decreasing sea ice, melting
of permafrost, ocean warming, and numerous positive feedback loops that
strengthen climate change processes) and a harbinger of wider
global-scale climate impacts, especially as the region opens more widely
to resource exploitation, maritime shipping, and geopolitical tensions
(Gerhardt et al. 2010; Steinberg & Dodds 2013; Steinberg et al. 2015).
It is no wonder, then, that many non-Arctic states and actors (i.e.,
those without national territory above the Arctic Circle) have taken a
greater interest in the use and management of the Arctic.

Lesson Overview

The lesson described here follows from the premises described above: The
Arctic is a global region but is divided and managed across many forms
of sovereignty; experiencing profound environmental changes with local,
regional, and global impacts; and a space in which traditional notions
and practices of state sovereignty and geopolitical thinking are being
both entrenched and challenged. It follows **[[a simulation]{.mark}
format]{.underline}** [[in which]{.underline}
**[students]{.underline}**]{.mark} are asked to [take on specific
roles]{.underline} representing various members of the Arctic Council
[and]{.underline} to [[act out]{.underline}]{.mark} via
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
a formal vote, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} subsequent
[**[writing]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} reports **[[a
particular hypothetical]{.underline}]{.mark}** question [that can
[demonstrate how]{.mark}]{.underline} liberal and realist **[[theories
in IR operate]{.underline}]{.mark}** in practice [[and
how]{.underline}]{.mark} **[critical [geographic
concepts]{.mark}]{.underline}** of region, scale, territory, and state
sovereignty can [help [push]{.mark}]{.underline} **[beyond the
[limits]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} these
[approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} in IR. The hypothetical question posed
centers on the addition of a non-Arctic state--- China---as a permanent
voting member of the Arctic Council. In the scenario for the simulation,
China has decided to move from being an observer "near-Arctic" state and
press for full membership on the Council. This follows from recent moves
by China to establish a stronger regional presence through economic and
scientific partnerships with Arctic states as well as China's
development of its own Arctic strategy, which was released in January
2018 and describes the country as "an important stakeholder in Arctic
affairs" (State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of
China 2018).

While there has been no specific push for China to move from observer
status at the Arctic Council to full voting member and it is unclear
whether such a move would even be possible given the constraints of the
organization and the Ottawa Declaration, a hypothetical scenario like
this permits some creative thinking based in real-world possibilities
and strategies and can help students overcome biases and preconceived
ideas that may be inherent in dealing with existing scenarios based on
current events (Taylor 2013; Shaw and Switky 2018). [Simulating a full
special Arctic Council meeting at which this application is
**presented**, **debated**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[voted
upon]{.underline}** [allows [students]{.mark} to
**[research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, present, [[and]{.underline}
**[debate]{.underline}** [the role of **non-** and near-Arctic
**states**]{.underline}]{.mark} in this global region and, given the
Council's varied membership, to investigate the meaning of territory and
sovereignty in relation to national interests, Indigenous rights, and
regional and global environmental stewardship. Guided by the core tenets
of liberal and realist understandings of international relations and the
political geographic critique of these approaches, [[students develop a
sense of]{.mark} the [complicated realities]{.mark} of international
institutions in practice [and]{.mark} the [intersection of multiple
issues]{.mark} across place and scale in the Arctic region.]{.underline}

Goals and Time Required

In this scenario, students represent different members of the Arctic
Council, with one representative from a member state acting as chair and
assuring that the agenda is followed and speakers are recognized and
held to time limits, as they debate China's application for full voting
membership. In doing so and presenting positions for or against the
inclusion of China as a full member, they may consider various points
addressed in background readings and primary documents, discussed below,
and the following specific questions, which can help prepare students
for the in-class Arctic Council meeting simulation itself:

• **[[What]{.underline}]{.mark}** major processes and
[**[trends]{.underline}** [are driving]{.underline}]{.mark} political,
social, economic, and environmental **[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the Arctic region**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}** [What are the pressing
issues]{.underline} that the Council might have to address in this, and
how would the addition of China as a full member enhance or complicate
the Arctic Council's capacity to fulfill its mandate[?]{.underline}

What are the principles that underlie the Arctic Council's existence and
mandate? What strategies and processes within and around the Council
ensure this mandate is met (or not)?

How do the different members and observers within the Arctic Council see
that body's role in managing the Arctic as a shared, global region and
providing a platform for pursuing national and international interests?

[[What are the specific national or organizational
interests]{.underline}]{.mark} of the different actors within the Arctic
Council, and how might China's more complete integration into that body
alter the dynamics of the Council and how other actors approach
it[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}

• **[[What forms of power are relevant to the hypothetical scenario
presented]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and how might different actors within
the Council present themselves within the context of a high-level
deliberation and potential vote on an issue of this
magnitude**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

How does the issue of China's status in the Arctic Council relate to
both the definition of the Arctic as a region and to broader themes and
trends beyond but affecting that region? [How does the Arctic's position
as a shared region shape different members' particular interests but
also how they view the intersection of issues across scales such as
climate change, economic development, cultural and political rights, and
global status?]{.underline}

This is a wide set of questions and, in practice, a full class meeting
of an undergraduate seminar course, totaling almost three hours, worked
well for this simulation, with additional outof-class time before and
after for preparation and writing of a summary report. This time allowed
for each member state, Indigenous representative, and observer state or
group to make a brief position statement, followed by open debate and a
final vote. This could be broken across two class periods, one for
statements and one for debate and vote, with time in between for side
meetings and negotiation, as would be common in any international body
that could take multiple hours or even days to consider and decide on
such a move. Like any high-level meeting, a clear agenda and
parliamentary procedure would guide the deliberations; a sample agenda
is shown in Figure 1.

Outcomes

The direct outcome of the discussion and debate about China's Arctic
Council membership application is a formal vote on the motion, "Should
the People's Republic of China be accepted as a full member of the
Arctic Council?" In practice, only the representatives of the Council's
eight member states would vote, while the six Indigenous peoples'
organizations that are permanent participants have the right to be
consulted on all Council decisions and negotiations and are supported in
this work by the Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat. Currently,
thirty-eight observers also have status within the Council, contributing
to projects, programs, and research initiatives through the Working
Groups that structure the body's primary activities. The observer group
consists of thirteen non-Arctic states (including China), thirteen
intergovernmental organizations, and twelve nongovernmental
organizations, providing a wide range of actors from which to assign
roles to students in setting up the simulation. While final
decision-making is in the hands of the eight Arctic state members, they
work by consensus rather than simple majoritarian votes, providing ample
room for students to negotiate and debate points of contention in
dealing with the particular scenario presented.

[While [Indigenous]{.mark} representatives do not vote, the duty to
[consult]{.mark} them [and]{.mark} their [right to address]{.mark} the
Council during meetings [give]{.mark} them a powerful voice and an
almost [de facto veto]{.mark} power in the Council's deliberations.
[These factors]{.mark} also [complicate]{.mark} the notion that
[sovereignty in the Arctic]{.mark} is exercised by states alone or that
it is [based]{.mark} solely [on territorial control]{.mark} by
states]{.underline}. As Indigenous peoples often reside across national
boundaries and have rights articulated through international framework
agreements, most importantly the UN Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples, incorporating their voices more directly in Council
deliberations and the simulation exercise also prevents national
interest and security from being read simplistically and directly from
state strategies. This also follows robust discussions within the
Council and Indigenous people's organizations about Indigenous
sovereignty and self-determination and highlights differences within and
between the permanent participants so that they are not read as a single
bloc with a unitary set of interests, capacities, or national contexts
(Cambou 2018; Landriault, Payette, and Roussel 2021).
[[Likewise]{.mark}, the wide array of [observer]{.mark} groups and
[states]{.mark} that would [provide]{.mark} consultative
[feedback]{.mark} on the question of **China's elevation** from
**observer** to full **voting member** introduces non-state actors into
consideration [and **forces a debate** over]{.mark} the **political**,
**social**, **economic**, and **environmental** [impacts of
allowing]{.mark} a [**near-Arctic state** to sit alongside **Arctic
counterparts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Following the statements,
deliberation, and vote in class, students write a report (at the senior
undergraduate level, students were asked to aim for five to seven pages)
on the primary issues that were debated, especially considerations of
sovereignty, territory, and geopolitics in a global Arctic; how these
related to their particular role in the simulation; and how these can
help students understand liberal and realist theories in IR. [[In
addition to building familiarity with]{.mark} the specific [empirical
content]{.mark} addressed in this simulation, such as issues [around
climate change, sovereignty and territory, and geographic
perspectives]{.mark} on IR theories, [students build research,

**Policy analysis is necessary to understand how settler colonialism is
reproduced THROUGH specific policies.**

We write **[as]{.underline}** two teacher **[educators]{.underline}**

**[another]{.underline}** **[kind]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
**[policy]{.underline}** **[analysis]{.underline}**]{.mark} in two ways.
First, we wanted to enact a participatory policy analysis, engaging in
collective research on something which impacts our labor. **[We also
wanted enact a different way of telling about our work, especially [by
attending to settler colonialism and antiblackness]{.mark}. [Too often
in education policy analysis, issues of race are discussed briefly, if
at all]{.mark}. Usually, [race is just another crosstab proffered as
part of the performance of policy analysis.]{.mark} In this way, [race
is equivocated with other social categories, including gender and
income; this equivocation is almost never useful for analyzing the
racialization of people in a settler
nation-state]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Of course, one is never
just racialized---we are also gendered, classed, and categorized
according to language, immigration status, indigeneity, ability, and
more, all at the same time. Yet, **[[our]{.underline}]{.mark}** more
**[enduring [concern is how the performance of disaggregating for race
ignores the need to more deeply consider what theories of race are being
enacted through policy, thus reifying connotations of race as natural,
inevitable, and permanent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It has been a central
tenet of critical race theory that race is a social construct (Omi &
Winant, 2014), an invention, a fiction with lived realities cultivated
in and supported in part through public policies (Atwood & López, 2014).
Black feminist legal scholar Kimberle **[Crenshaw]{.underline}** (1991)
**[has emphasized the material effects of the social construction of
race.]{.underline}** Our article shows the utility of theorizing settler
colonial constructions of race for analyzing education policy. As we
describe below, taking seriously the projects of settler colonialism as
they align to require particular constructions of race will inform
policy analyses and where they can go. **[Discussing the roles of race
and racism in education policy is difficult because, ironically in U.S.
society, calling someone a racist is an enormous offense, perhaps a
slur.]{.underline}** We say ironic because examples of interpersonal and
institutional, intimate, and state racism abound. Another insight of
critical race theory is that racism is an everyday occurrence; racism is
"pedestrian rather than spectacular" (Holland, 2012, p. 3). Yet **[to
point out racism, to say "this policy is racist" requires a mammoth
burden of proof]{.underline}** (Atwood & López, 2014). The instrument
mandated by the policy at the heart of this article, edTPA, is the
co-creation of a highly regarded education scholar who has been a
champion of young people of color in public schools. **[Is this policy
racist? Is the problem the way it has been adopted in New York State? Is
any standardized test not racist? These are questions that are difficult
to answer, because, as Jared Sexton (2008) has observed, almost "every
attempt to discern the elusive core of racism, to approach its shadowy
secret, drives it further from view"]{.underline}** (p. 27).

#### The United States Federal government should substantially increase its Arctic development by developing local governance structures that prioritizes indigenous leadership and Arctic wealth reinvestment. 

**Moeser 23**, Arctic Institute organizer and Alaskan SeaLife Educator.

Analysis of Resource Development in the US Arctic," The Arctic
Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/decolonization-arctic-engagement-critical-analysis-resource-development-us-arctic/,)

Background

The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867. Just over a century later, in 1968, the discovery of oil
in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national scale.7) [The
commercial export of oil to the lower 48 states was now possible for the
first time. Hindering this ambition, however, was the fact that the
planned pipeline to carry the oil south traversed lands claimed by
Alaska Native populations]{.underline}. 'Alaska Native' refers
collectively to the Indigenous populations who have lived in present-day
Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the
1700s.8) This term encompasses "many nations and tribes" and "widely
diverse cultures, languages, lifeways, art forms and histories".9) To
enable the construction of the pipeline to the contiguous United States,
land claims issues around Prudhoe Bay were settled with the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. [[ANCSA extinguished
Indigenous claims to]{.mark} nearly [400 million acres]{.mark} of land
throughout the state in exchange for \$962.5 million and ownership of
43.7 million acres.]{.underline}

[[ANCSA]{.mark} also [divided the state into]{.mark} twelve
[regions]{.mark}, [each with an **Alaska Native Regional
Corporation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The regional boundaries of the
corporations do not, however, equate to land ownership; [land in Alaska
is predominantly owned by the state and federal governments. Just 10
percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles are owned by Alaska Native
populations]{.underline}.10) [The Regional Corporations operate under US
corporate law to administer resources and serve the local communities.
[These for-profit corporations participate in the Alaskan natural
resource industry]{.mark}, both directly and indirectly]{.underline}.

**[[Federal Arctic policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the US has tended to
**[[emphasize]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Arctic resources for US
economic development.11) Within the new National Strategy for the Arctic
Region (released October 2022), **[[economic development continues to
receive a strong emphasis]{.underline}]{.mark}**---alongside
security---and Arctic investments are expected to increase over the
following decade.12) In the face of this ever-growing interest in Arctic
engagement, [Alaska Native communities may face new and renewed colonial
intrusion in the form of large-scale resource
development]{.underline}.13)

Effects of resource development

Continual 'boom and bust' with periods of financial growth and decline
characterizes resource development in the capitalist system.14) This
instability prohibits many communities from relying solely on economies
centered on resource extraction. Subsistence practices provide a source
of greater stability within what would otherwise be an unstable
extractive economy.15) Resource extraction has, however, had detrimental
impacts on the land, water, and wildlife that reduce the viability of
subsistence lifeways. Specifically, extractive activities have been
found to increase vulnerability to biological invasion,16) bring changes
to the land with built infrastructure,17) and introduce the risk of
contamination, such as oil spills.18) The resulting decreased viability
of subsistence practices is worsened by the threat climate change poses
to hunting and gathering activities.19)

Although some measures of physical health have improved since ANCSA,20)
resource extraction can compromise the health and wellbeing of nearby
Indigenous populations. Significant health disparities remain among
Alaska Natives compared to non-native Alaskans and other US residents.
Generally, Alaska Natives have a lower life expectancy, increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, and an elevated burden of infectious
disease.21) By exacerbating food insecurity, the negative impacts of
resource development may contribute to and worsen health outcomes. Many
of these disparities are rooted in the history of colonialism and
socio-political marginalization; in addition, their persistence today
may be attributed to the disproportionate exposure to environmental
health hazards.22) Moreover, some researchers have found that health
data fails to produce a holistic picture of well-being, suggesting that
there must be a greater consideration for context-specific
understandings of health status.23)

Importantly, [the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives. Instead, various facets of identity among individuals
and communities impact how they relate to extractive activities.
Socioeconomic class divisions]{.underline},24) [gender
identity]{.underline},25) [one's location in a rural versus urban
setting]{.underline},26) [and many other factors can all impact how
resource development is experienced]{.underline}. The complexity of the
relationship between resource development and Indigenous populations,
and the diversity within the Alaska Native population, must not be
ignored or simplified.

Sovereignty and the prioritization of state interests

**[[To decolonize resource development]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [Alaska
[Native populations must have greater control over the
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [one overarching aim of
decolonization in practice is Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline}.
However, (neo)colonial narratives shape and are ingrained within the
traditional concept of state-centered sovereignty. Within this concept,
the aims of the government are continually prioritized; a hierarchy is
established whereby the interests and concerns of the state are given
primacy.27) This dynamic is one of the reasons why, in the case of
Alaska and Alaska Native populations, resource development continues to
be experienced as a colonial enterprise. [[The gains]{.mark} from
extractive activities [do not necessarily or primarily benefit Alaska
Native populations]{.mark}]{.underline},28) [and the interests of
outside actors are prioritized]{.underline}.29) [Oftentimes,
[wealth]{.mark} from resource development has been extracted from
northern regions to [benefit other populations]{.mark}]{.underline}.30)
An evaluation of the Red Dog Mine in northwest Alaska, for instance,
found that the local population received a relatively modest share of
benefits in terms of employment, income, and mobility.31)

[As established through ANCSA, [the **Regional Corporations** are the
**primary route** for **Alaska Native participation** in **governing
resource development in the US Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[These
corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[operate under]{.mark} US
corporate law and]{.underline}, therefore, [within the frameworks of
[the capitalist order]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Participation]{.mark}
through the structure of the Regional Corporations, thus,
[limits]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark} for Alaska Native populations
to achieve self-determination outside of those conventions]{.underline}.
In action, considering the embeddedness of the corporations within the
capitalist and colonial dynamics of the state,
**[[decolonization]{.mark} may [necessitate enhancing]{.mark} the power
of and regard for [local governments]{.mark} rather than governing
resource development principally through the Regional
Corporations]{.underline}**.

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

A deep-rooted colonial mentality that remains pervasive is the assumed
supremacy of a Western knowledge system. This creates a paternalistic
relationship wherein decisions are made by external 'experts' and
imposed upon the Indigenous population. In short, Indigenous ways of
knowing are undermined.32) The term Indigenous knowledge is defined as
"the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with
long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings".33)
[[Efforts to decolonize resource development]{.mark} in the US Arctic
[must not only embrace these different]{.mark} worldviews, perspectives,
and [knowledge systems, but put them first.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The forms of organization this requires must go further than the

They attempt to lead the masses, not organize them, and that's a big
difference. The party model might in general be insufficient for mass

more appropriate, but only if they can overcome the assumption that the
looser the connections are, the better. [This assumption is

ever more [flexible **[market economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[but
not]{.underline}]{.mark} of effective **[[political
organizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [To "**have contacts**" is **not
enough**]{.underline}; you need to do something with them. And [[you
need to **stay committed**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the projects you
initiate. I will try to flesh this out by listing the aspects I consider
most important in organizing today.

1\. We need to leave sectarianism behind. The left is weak and each
additional division weakens it further. In a 2011 article titled
"Movement, Cadre, and the Dual Power," Joel Olson made a simple, yet
very important observation: "We believe that the old arguments between
communists and anarchists are largely irrelevant today." This must be
our point of departure.

2\. [We need theory that is adapted to our times]{.underline}. It must
[overcome]{.underline} the [false contradiction between "class struggle"
and "cultural struggle.]{.underline}" There is a fruitful debate about a
"new class politics" in the German-speaking world. Sebastian Friedrich,
one of its main proponents, drew these conclusions in an article
published by Counterpunch:

> A new **[class politics]{.underline}** [does not relegate
> **[gender]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[race]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
> [[and **imperial legacy**]{.mark} to]{.underline} issues that are
> **[supplementary]{.underline}** to class relations. These issues, and
> the struggles they imply, [[are an integral part of class
> relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, [**[feminist]{.mark}**,
> **[anti-racist]{.mark}**, [and **anti-colonial struggles** are the
> base on which]{.mark} effective [unified **class struggles must be
> launched**]{.mark}]{.underline}.... A new class politics must clarify
> where and how the specific experiences of workers based on gender,
> race, citizenship, and other factors converge. It must reveal the
> overlapping interests of workers as members of the class. This makes
> common struggles possible.

3\. We must not rely on the "objective forces" identified by historical
materialism. Subjective forces are important for change. It is easy to
underestimate how much neoliberalism shapes the lives even of people
opposed to it. In the Global North, [political activism has become a
leisure activity that people engage in or not, depending on their mood,
the identity they are trying to create for themselves, or the road of
"self-improvement" they have chosen]{.underline}. In almost all cases,
it is secondary to professional careers and personal comforts. Under
such circumstances, it is difficult to get anything done. There is
nothing wrong with being "voluntaristic." [[Radical change is dependent
on]{.mark} people [wanting radical change]{.mark}]{.underline}, no
matter how much Marxists still insist on economic realities determining
individual consciousness and, therefore, individuals' capacity for
political action. [An [organization's]{.mark} **efficiency [relies
on]{.mark}** the individual **qualities of its members**, that is,
**responsibility**, [**reliability**, and
**accountability**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Making Things Concrete]{.underline}**

If we want communism to be more than a pipe dream, [we have to be
willing to face reality, even if it confuses, challenges, or even
frightens us]{.underline}. We cannot ignore struggles that refer to
communist ideals, simply because they aren't the struggles we'd like to
see. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} our enthusiasm for
[**[communism]{.underline}** [remains limited to]{.underline} **[lecture
halls]{.underline}**]{.mark} and conference rooms, [[it won't be
anything]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[powerful]{.underline}]{.mark}**
will lose sleep over.

The struggle that currently receives most attention among communists of
all stripes in the Global North is the one in Kurdistan. In Rojava
(Syrian Kurdistan), forces affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party,
**[[PKK]{.underline}]{.mark}**, have [[established]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[direct-democratic council]{.underline}]{.mark} system, based on the
"democratic confederalism" conceived by the imprisoned PKK leader
Abduallah Öcalan. Öcalan describes democratic confederalism as "a
non-state political administration or a democracy without a state," and
cites Murray Bookchin's "libertarian municipalism" as a major influence.
There are people who celebrate this as a form of anarchism. But as an
observant friend of mine noted, an anarchism that is imposed by a leader
is a strange kind of anarchism. Besides, there are reports from the
ground that challenge the libertarian narrative. The editors of Lower
Class Magazine, an online project dedicated to "low budget underground
journalism," travel regularly to Kurdistan and have the following to
say:

> [The Western left sees Rojava as the realization of a democracy "from
> below]{.underline}": communes, councils, a confederation; no
> hierarchies, no party, a spontaneous mass project. Anarchists and
> "libertarian" communists wax lyrically about the dawn of a
> direct-democratic Shangri-La. \[...\] Yes, the
> [[change]{.underline}]{.mark} in Rojava [[comes "from
> below]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is based on]{.mark} the power of [the
> people]{.mark}]{.underline}, no doubt. Communes and councils are at
> the heart of decision-making, that is true. But as essential is the
> following: [[None of this would be happening if it wasn't for a
> vanguard]{.underline}]{.mark} leading the way. The revolution in
> [Rojava proves that Leninist vanguardism is correct]{.underline}, not
> false.

Another European journalist visiting the region noted that the cadres of
the [People's Protection Units, YPG, relate to the councils of Rojava in
the same way the Bolshevists related to the councils of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Furthermore, there are troubling pragmatic
alliances, which have included collaboration with the U.S. military. Yet
the people behind Rojava Solidarity NYC sum up the situation well:

> Rojava, an autonomous region in Northern Syrian, the largest
> [[revolutionary territory]{.underline}]{.mark} of the 21st century,
> has [[projected]{.underline}]{.mark} anarchist and [[communist ideas
> to the forefront of political discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} and into
> the pragmatic and messy reality of everyday life. ... From communal
> relationships to the councils and self-defense units, we can assess
> numerous potential routes by which we can create liberated communities
> at home, while learning from their possibilities and pitfalls.

[Rojava won't be the answer to our problems. No single struggle ever is.
But the developments in Rojava challenge us to discuss real-life
strategies for radical change]{.underline}. It is easy to focus on
shortcomings, but if this is all we ever do, where will it get us?

Councils are essential for communist projects. Their power, which is
based on the direct involvement and active participation of the masses,
is curtailed as soon as political interest groups, such as parties,
assume control over them. This conviction separated historical council
communism, represented by figures such as Otto Rühle and Anton
Pannekoek, from the Bolsheviks. Pannekoek wrote:

> The councils are no government; not even the most central councils
> bear a governmental character. For they have no means to impose their
> will upon the masses; they have no organs of power. All social power
> is vested in the hands of the workers themselves.

Unless we want the transition to communism to entail enormous human
suffering (which would be utterly absurd), we need to consider the fact
that [[billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of people [will [need to be

consumption---the standards of consumption in the Global North cannot
and should not be upheld, since they are unsustainable.) Furthermore,
[[we must]{.mark} collectively [dispose]{.mark}]{.underline} of
industrial and [nuclear waste]{.underline}, [**[w]{.mark}**eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} ticking **[[environmental
bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. None of this is possible without a level
of centralization, no matter how visceral the reactions are that the
word might provoke in some circles.

Only a council system can combine the centralization required by the
complexity of modern societies with participative democracy.
Centralization requires formal structures. Participative **[[democracy
requires]{.underline}]{.mark}** [these [structures]{.mark} to [be
**transparent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They need to be bottom-up rather
than top-down, and delegates must be directly responsible to their
constituencies. [The [council system is]{.mark} the [only]{.mark}
administrative [framework to provide that.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Romanticizing particular struggles rarely does any good]{.underline},
no matter how council-based they are---or claim to be. If radicals in
the Global North fail to address concerns with respect to struggles in
the Global South, it is not respectful but condescending. To escape into
the intellectual poverty of cultural relativism doesn't help.
[[We]{.mark} can only [evolve from critical
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[real-life struggles are our
starting point]{.underline}]{.mark}. It makes little sense to demand
struggles for communism if we shy away from engaging with the ones that
exist. Arundhati Roy put it simply after spending time with Maoist
Naxalites in the forests of central India, an experience she chronicled
in the book Walking with the Comrades. She said: "I went in because I
wanted to tell the story of who these people are." [[This
**informs**]{.mark} revolutionary **[theory]{.mark} and**, in turn,
**[improves]{.mark}** revolutionary **[practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Most importantly, it is crucial for saving communist struggles from
betraying their own principles. Everyone can watch failure unfold. The
challenge lies in helping to prevent it.

Rooted in the exploitation of labor,
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** has always produced deep
contradictions in social life, and it has therefore always [**[required
ideologies]{.underline}** [that explain away]{.underline}]{.mark} those
**[[contradictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Throughout the capitalist
era, [certain ideological strategies become dominant when]{.underline}
the advance of [technology]{.underline}, driven by private accumulation,
[brings]{.underline} about qualitative [changes]{.underline} that upturn
everyday life, as happened, for instance, in the early stages of
industrialization and resulting urbanization in Britain in the late
eighteenth century; at the height of European imperialism at the turn of
the 20th century; and in the shift to \"post-industrial\" capitalism in
the 1960s and 1970s in the global North. At such times, [**dominant
[discourses absorb]{.mark}** the **[material contradictions]{.mark}** of
the social **[into]{.mark}** the **[immaterial]{.mark} [realm of
language]{.mark}, feeling and thought**---**[where]{.mark}** the
[**sharp lines of class** are **blurred**]{.mark}, the **mechanistic
aspects** of life **are** made **fluid**, and the \"ugliness\" of the
city is replaced by the aesthetics of nature.]{.underline}

In the 21st century, global capitalism\'s commodification of all aspects
of life has reached new heights, requiring new modes of explaining away
the material roots. [[From]{.mark} cloning and **bioengineered food**,
to ever-newer forms of human-technological **hybrids**, to
**[overfishing]{.mark}** and **industrialization** of
**[slaughterhouses]{.mark}**, to the **[privatization of]{.mark} public
sources of [water]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[selling]{.mark} of
\"[hot air]{.mark}**\" (which makes it possible for rich nations to
avoid lowering emissions), to the \"synthetic biology\" by which
biocapitalists like J. Craig Venter hope new living creatures will be
produced to substitute fossil fuels---there is [no aspect of]{.mark}
social or natural [life]{.mark} that [is immune from]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark}]{.underline}. Capital\'s endless and inherently
crisis-ridden drive to accumulate profit has, on the one hand, led to a
new scramble among nations of the global North to privatize the world\'s
dwindling natural resources regardless of the human and ecological
consequences. What this competitive drive has lead to, among other
things, is the scientific explorations of new bio-horizons: what Venter
calls a \"new industrial revolution\" (Pollack). On the other hand, the
most recent effects of **[[capitalist
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**---beginning with the 2007 housing market
crash---[have been used to [justify]{.mark}]{.underline} further
**[[privatization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} **[social
resources]{.underline}**, [[leading to]{.underline}]{.mark} historically
unprecedented **[cuts [in wages]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[employment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[social
programs]{.underline}**]{.mark} throughout the global North.

[It is not surprising]{.underline}, then, [that cultural theory has
become more and more concerned with the relation between human and
non-human life and with the instrumentalities used by the former to
control the latter]{.underline}. Broadly characterized by a
\"**[posthuman]{.underline}**\" [displacement of]{.underline} humanist
priorities of **[reason]{.underline}**, **[rationality]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Cartesian dualism]{.underline}**, [at the center of
which is a **human subject**]{.underline} constructed as fundamentally
different from and superior to non-human animals and life and capable of
developing reliable knowledge of and control over the objective
world---a [wide range of [cultural writing]{.mark}]{.underline} today
has [**[become]{.underline}** [concerned with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[increasing [subjugation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of
nature]{.underline} **[to human calculation]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and control]{.underline}**, and call for a new inquiry into the
relation of the human and its other. Some, like Giorgio Agamben, address
the increasing efforts of the state to control and manage all aspects of
human and non-human life (Homo Sacer; The Open). [Others, like Antonio
Negri and Michael Hardt, focus on the efforts by corporations to
privatize the knowledges, affects and technologies that have been
developed through the collective energies of what they call the
multitude: the efforts to enclose the digital commons in the interests
of a powerful few]{.underline} (Commonwealth). Graham Harman goes so far
as to suggest that [the \"being\" of tools is constitutive of all being
in the contemporary moment]{.underline} (Tool-Being), while Peter Menzel
and Faith D\'Alusio celebrate the displacement of homo sapiens by the
notion of robo sapiens (Robo Sapiens). Among one of the most popular
developments in contemporary posthumanist theory, animal studies,
writers like Cary Wolfe, Donna Haraway, Kelly Oliver, and Matthew
Calarco, taking their cue from Derrida\'s later writings (i.e., The
Animal That Therefore I Am), address what is for them the
instrumentalizing and unethical discourses of humanism, which justifies
its violence toward non-human species by its epistemological centering
of the human: the \"anthropological machine\" (Agamben, The Open).

But what drives the \"new industrial revolution\" (Venter) is what drove
the \"old\" one: [the use of technology to appropriate surplus
labor]{.underline} (the source of profit) at the point of production.
[[**Profit** is **not derived** from \"**nature**\" but
**labor**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [in order for **nature** to **become** a
**commodifiable resource**, it **must become transformed by** human
**labor**, which is itself a dialectical outcome of nature.]{.underline}
This is another way of saying that the commodification of life on such a
planetary scale today is only possible on the basis of the
commodification of human labor power. **[[Biocapitalism is first and
foremost]{.mark} a regime of [wage labor]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Contemporary cultural theory\'s concern with the effects of capitalism
on non-human life, however, has mystified capital\'s material roots, and
one of the central means by which this has been accomplished is what I
call machine-thinking.

[**[Machine-thinking]{.underline}** [treats capitalism
as]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[instrumentalized]{.underline}]{.mark}**
mode of **[[thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [a mechanized mode of
knowing which subjects all (non-) human life to its logic.]{.underline}
Whether this logic is understood in the more positive terms of Henry
Jenkins, John Johnston or Bernard Stiegler, who sees a fundamental
connection between humans and technology and suggests that \"The human
invents himself in the technical by inventing the tool\" (Stiegler,
Technics and Time 141), or in the \"negative\" terms of those like Paul
Virilio or Horkheimer and Adorno, who suggest that \"A technological
rationale is the rationale of domination itself. It is the coercive
nature of society alienated from itself\" (Dialectic of Enlightenment
121), [machine-thinking **[(mis)reads]{.mark}** as the
**[instrumentalization]{.mark}** of society [**what is** in
reality]{.mark} the **marketization** of society---by which I mean the
**[domination]{.mark}** of all aspects of life **[by]{.mark} exchange
value and** the **subordination** of use value]{.underline} (which meets
human needs, including the need to preserve the earth\'s diverse
ecological systems) [**to [profit]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[These misreadings]{.underline}**, in effect,
**[[transcode]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[material relations]{.mark} of
production]{.underline} under capitalism [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[immaterial]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[translate]{.underline}** [the labor relations of the machine into
**[instrumental reason]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In different idioms, such
discourses consequently turn the problem of capitalism into the problem
of technologization and what Heidegger, one of the twentieth century\'s
most influential machine-thinkers, calls \"technē, a process of
reflection in service to doing and making\" (\"Letter on Humanism\"
218). On these terms, at stake is not exploitation but
instrumentalization. Contemporary discourses see capitalism in terms of
what Heidegger identifies in \"The Question Concerning Technology\" as
the truth of technology in the modern era: its \"enframing\" logic
(325), which ensures that in a technological age \"even the cultivation
of the field has comes under the grip of another kind of
setting-in-order, which sets upon nature. It sets upon it in the sense
of challenging it. Agriculture is now the mechanized food industry, air
is now set upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield
uranium, for example\" (320).

[But the focus on the way that]{.underline}, in a technological society,
[neither nature nor humans are meaningful in and of themselves but as
means toward an end---or the way that, as Heidegger puts it, an
instrumental approach \"expedites in that it unlocks and exposes\" and
is fundamentally oriented \"toward driving on the maximum yield at the
minimum expense]{.underline}\" (321)---**[[isolates technology
from]{.mark} both the broader [material conditions]{.mark} in which it
is developed [and]{.mark} the [class interests it
serves]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For capital \"drives on the maximum yield
at the minimum expense,\" not because of the \"dialectic of
enlightenment,\" as Horkheimer and Adorno contend, but for the purposes
of private accumulation. [Humans are \"set upon\" nature in order to
maximize surplus labor for the owner who buys the labor of others and
makes a profit from it.]{.underline} To put this another way, humans are
set upon nature because they are set upon themselves. And because the
material relations of society set the terms for the relations between
humans and nature, [**[only]{.mark}** under **[fundamentally changed
relations]{.mark} between humans [can humans develop new relations to
nature]{.mark}** and non-human species.]{.underline}

[[Yet the solution]{.underline}]{.mark} to the instrumentalization of
human and natural life [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} Heidegger and other
(neo)**[[romantics]{.underline}]{.mark}** like Derrida, Wolfe, and
Calarco [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a fundamental change in social
relations but [[a return to]{.underline}]{.mark} the \"material\" as
**[[non-]{.mark}instrumental [reason]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the
non-reason of nature, the body, feeling, spirit,
\"**[[poeisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" the non-human, and so on): in
short, [[a **de-materialized material**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Theorists
of capitalism-as-machine-thinking construct a post-rational linguistic
realm of higher values which are assumed to exceed restricting codes and
conventions. For \"mechanical\" modes of thought which focus on
classifying being and the \"metaphysics\" of presence (essentialism),
they substitute speculative, fluid concepts which foreground becoming,
flux, and hybridity---what Goethe refers to as \"morphology\" and
Derrida calls the \"double-session\" and later \"l\'animot.\" [For the
Cartesian separation of subject and object they posit a subject which
cannot be extricated from its embeddedness in the world except through a
violent act of human(ist) abstraction]{.underline}.

**[Machine-thinkers]{.underline}**, in other words,
[[oppose]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[effects of
capitalism]{.underline}** [by blurring]{.underline} **[social
boundaries]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[essentializing]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[epistemological
[distinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** in an effort, not to transform
capitalism, but to find a freer mode of life outside of the social
(outside the city). It involves, as Wolfe puts it in his annotation of
R.L. Rutsky\'s theory of posthumanism, \"participat\[ing\] in---and
find\[ing\] a mode of thought adequate to---\'processes which can never
be entirely reduced to patterns or standards, codes or information\'\"
(What is Posthumanism? xviii). [This is a]{.underline} (not so distant)
[[echo of Thoreau\'s]{.mark} romantic [desire to]{.mark} \"[wander far
beyond]{.mark}\... the narrow limits\" of restricting codes and
conventions in everyday]{.underline} life, into the realm of what he
calls \"Extra vagance!\": the fulfillment of the \"desire to speak
somewhere without bounds\" (Walden 270).

Not coincidentally, [the \"nature\" that thereby becomes valorized by
critics of machine-thinking is, in effect, a rewriting of romantic
discourses]{.underline}. As much as theorists locate themselves beyond
naïve (humanist) constructions of nature, nature in [**[contemporary
theory]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately **[[a
bio-fantasy of]{.mark} a nature \"[outside]{.mark}\" of [and]{.mark}
fundamentally [disruptive of]{.mark} the social relations of
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In opposition to techne, in other
words, machine-thinkers oppose (natural) \"life\" itself (\"bios\").
Along these lines, in some contemporary posthumanist discourse,
\"nature\" betrays a \"viral\" or \"mutational logic\" that \"exceeds
and encompasses the boundary between the living or organic and the
mechanical or technical\" and thus becomes \"parasitical\" (Wolfe, What
is Posthumanism? xviii-xix)---a \"natural\" logic that is represented as
breaking the bounds of existing (social) thought but that ends up being
a new species of deconstruction. Leaving aside for the moment
posthumanism\'s updating of deconstruction, one of the key points here
is that rather than changing the relations in which life is lived, the
new battle cry of the left centers on new ways of thinking about life as
excessive of human relations. Machine-thinking is in effect a romantic
means of disappearing the social. Life is re-articulated as \"machine\"
and \"nature,\" and as a consequence, what makes both---social
labor---becomes a fiction.

I argue that **[[such rewritings]{.mark} of capitalism]{.underline}** as
machine-thinking are part of a long line of romantic writings of the
social which [[emerge with]{.mark} particular [force at times of]{.mark}
economic [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Romanticism]{.underline}**, I
argue, is not merely a particular historical manifestation of a literary
sensibility. It [is a broader response]{.underline} (literary,
philosophical, cultural and political) [in the post-Renaissance West to
the contradictions of capitalism]{.underline}:
[**[contradictions]{.mark} which romanticism [reads in terms
of]{.mark}** science and technology and, in particular, **instrumental
[rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To put this another way, [the
[translation of]{.mark} the [material]{.mark} contradictions of capital
[into]{.mark} the [ideal]{.mark}]{.underline} (and in particular
\"machine thinking\") [is a structural feature of
capitalism]{.underline}. It is rooted in the way that capital, as it
develops, increasingly \"resolve\[s\] personal worth into exchange
value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms,
has set up that single, unconscionable freedom---Free Trade,\" one of
the central consequences of which is that \"for
[**[exploitation]{.underline}**, [veiled by]{.underline}]{.mark}
religious and **[[political illusions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [it has
substituted]{.underline} naked, shameless, direct, **[brutal
exploitation]{.underline}**\" (Marx and Engels, Manifesto of the
Communist Party).

Romanticism has always challenged the effects of capitalist relations
(giving it a semblance of radicality) but not its root cause
(exploitation). In this vein, Emerson, for instance, argues that
\"Poetry is the consolation of mortal men,\" because they \"live
cabined, cribbed, confined in a narrow and trivial lot---in wants,
pains, anxieties and superstitions, in profligate politics, in personal
animosities, in mean employments---and victims of these; and the nobler
powers untried, unknown\" (\"Poetry and Imagination\" 37). \"A poet
comes,\" Emerson continues, \"who lifts the veil; gives them glimpses of
the laws of the universe\" (37-8). And what the poet reveals, according
to Emerson, is that reality is only the phenomenal appearance of a
higher, spiritual reality. Romantics like Emerson confine their
understanding of capitalist conditions to its alienating effects and use
of technology in the city (the space of the most developed technology
and class divisions). [They therefore misread capitalism as primarily a
rigid, homogenizing and instrumental way of thinking]{.underline}.
**[[Poetry thus \"consoles\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** ~~men~~, for
Emerson, [[because]{.underline}]{.mark}, through it, **[[the \"veil\"
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** phenomenal [**[reality]{.underline}** [is
lifted to]{.underline}]{.mark} [reveal]{.underline} **[a [symbolic
universe]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[which resists]{.mark} the
**[instrumentality]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., the placing of ends
before means) of modern life. Which is another way of saying that
Emerson [[reduces]{.underline} **[capitalism]{.underline}** [to
something that **cannot be changed**]{.underline}, [only **thought about
differently**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The concern, in other words, is with
the ways in which, as Heidegger puts it, a technological age \"take\[s\]
thinking itself to be a technē, a process of reflection in service to
doing and making\" (\"Letter on Humanism\" 218). Nothing---and no
one---is meaningful in and of itself, but for something else (a means
toward an end).

This reading of instrumentality de-historicizes and de-materializes
instrumentality. In focusing only on the how of instrumentality---how
instrumental thinking equates the valuable with the efficient, with
efficaciousness---[the reasons why this has become the dominant logic in
capitalism fade into the background]{.underline}. In fact, the
marginalization of the why in cultural theory has become grounds for
treating Heidegger (among others) as a militant against the metaphysics
of origin and religious origin in particular. Along these lines, Timothy
Clark affirms that, for Heidegger, \"Ultimately, like human existence
itself, it \[Being\] is without a \'why\' (has nothing we might
recognize as a meaning): it happened because it happened\" (34). Yet in
the name of the destruction of religious and metaphysical origin,
[Heidegger has been instrumental in updating spiritualism and, in
effect, in dismantling the knowledge of material origin.]{.underline}

Poetry, for both Emerson and Heidegger, re-thinks the contemporary, and,
in a more or less overtly religious language, produces a subject that
recognizes the world\'s (material) insignificance from the vantage point
of a higher immaterial reality. \"Every natural fact,\" Emerson writes
in Nature, \"is a symbol of some spiritual fact\" (26).

The mode of romanticism I address in this essay is ultimately a class
response to the contradictions of capitalism which it reads in terms of
science and technology, and in particular instrumental rationality. To
be more specific, this romantic construction of nature (including
nostalgia for the past) is a response to the fact that, as Marx and
Engels argue,

[The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to
all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations]{.underline}. It has
pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his
\"natural superiors\", and has left remaining no other nexus between man
and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment\". It has
drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous
enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of
egotistical calculation. [It has resolved personal worth into exchange
value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms,
has set up that single, unconscionable freedom---Free
Trade]{.underline}. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious
and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct,
brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto
honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the
physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into
its paid wage labourers. (Manifesto 486-7)

Romantic machine-thinking is a response to capital\'s relentless
conversion of people into wage-laborers---a process which, in times of
crisis, hits the \"middle\" sectors of class society (i.e,
intellectuals, the petit-bourgeois) particularly hard. [[Facing]{.mark}
the [deep insecurity of]{.mark} their [class position]{.mark} yet
ultimately opposed to the working class struggle to transform capital,
the [first line]{.mark} of defense [among
intellectuals]{.mark}]{.underline} facing growing economic and social
crisis **[[has always been the turn to the immaterial]{.mark}, and often
the irrational.]{.underline}** That is to say, **[romantic idealism is a
discursive relay of the displaced
petit-bourgeoisie]{.underline}**---and, in the face of the rising
conflict between labor and capital, [signals a retreat into and [call
for]{.mark} some]{.underline} \"[**[other way of life]{.underline}**\"
[in order not to engage]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[material conflicts]{.mark} of the present]{.underline}**. This is
why it [surfaces with such force during]{.underline} moments of
**[intensified crisis]{.underline}**. Thus, **[for
instance]{.underline}**, the rise of romanticism in **[late
1700s]{.underline}** to the early 1800s is also the time of
revolutionary upheavals, [the intensified destruction of peasant life,
as well as the consolidation of the early industrial city]{.underline}
with its obvious class contradictions with life in the early factories
(before the period of \"social reform\" from the 1840s on in
England)---which romanticism sees in terms of the excesses of
Enlightenment rationality and the logic of quantification.

**[[Disney imagineers]{.underline}]{.mark}** have just [[rolled
out]{.underline}]{.mark} a powerful anecdote, connected to the November
release of its latest animation, **[[Moana]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[wherein]{.mark} an elder]{.underline} from Mo'orea, in French
Polynesia, is depicted as having [asked]{.underline} one of them, "For
years, [we have been swallowed by your culture]{.underline} ...; this
one time, **[can you be swallowed by ours?"]{.underline}**

The image of one of our **[[revered elders humbly
petitioning]{.underline}]{.mark}** agents of the gargantuan media and
merchandising conglomerate for just one moment of cultural attention
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} a historical wave of
[[western]{.underline}]{.mark} acculturative [[forces makes it sound as
if Moana]{.mark} the film [is a gift]{.mark} straight [from
Disney]{.mark} Inc.'s golden [heart]{.mark}]{.underline}. But make no
mistake about it, **[[any altruism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [associated
with]{.underline} this latest **[commercial]{.underline}**
ad-**[venture]{.underline}** [[will always be trumped
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the proverbial **[bottom line]{.underline}**,
but more depressingly, by an enduring colonial legacy in the Pacific
islands that is further animated in the 21st century [by]{.underline}
**[[neoliberal]{.underline}]{.mark}** and postcolonial
[**[desires]{.underline}** [for selling]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
consuming]{.underline} **[[native culture]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a
very specific type.

Indeed the anecdote appears to be part of Disney's push back against a
small but growing movement of Pacific Islanders who are expressing
outcry, mostly in social media, against the company's trafficking on
indigenous cultural heritage.

To date, charges of distasteful representation, cultural appropriation,
and crass commercialization of Islander culture and tradition have
focused on early roll-outs of merchandise, like a [[ghastly]{.mark}
tattooed [skin-suit of]{.mark}]{.underline} the Polynesian demigod
[**[Maui]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} [plastic figurines
that [demonize]{.mark} Pele as]{.underline} **["[the lava
witch",]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[or evil]{.mark} coconuts dancing
a]{.underline} thinly veiled Maori **[[haka]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
on broader colonial discourses of cultural commodification.

Indeed, Disney does not seem averse to pitting Islander against
Islander. For example, the gushing article -- apparently part of a
strategic targeting of Pacific Islander pop culture sites and networks,
including special screenings to Pacific islanders in the diaspora \--
[[acknowledges]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[contention]{.underline}**" by
academics and activists like myself, but [only to counter]{.underline}
the [**[criticism]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[happy
[news of]{.mark}]{.underline}** just **[[how
rigorous]{.underline}]{.mark}** and dedicated the **[[corporate
storytellers were]{.underline}]{.mark}** in doing their research, and
just how lovingly accepted they are in certain, key islands of the
Pacific.

The gist of the corporate storyline, and probably the company's talking
points, is that Disney really cares, that it really got it right this
time because it did its homework, and that the final products -- the
film, the merchandise, any licensed spin-offs \-- vouched safe by the
appropriate island authorities, will be the best thing ever for the
whole wide world. It would seem as if Moana -- **[the
Ocean]{.underline}** --truly **[beckons]{.underline}**.

[At the heart]{.underline} of this marketing claim and bid to silence
opposition [is]{.underline} the **[supposed blessing]{.underline}** that
**[Disney]{.underline}** has [received from]{.underline} what the
article's author dubbed as a kind of transpacific
"**[village]{.underline}**" [comprised of]{.underline} the region's
**[cultural experts]{.underline}**, talent, traditional chiefs,
[and]{.underline} **[especially "academic" experts]{.underline}**.
Before I return specifically to what's problematic about this supposed
indigenous certification of the disneyfication of Pacific-wide culture
and tradition, it merits always repeating, when it comes to anything
Disney, that there are a few other important backstories that need to be
foregrounded.

First, Disney has a long and [[demonstrable]{.mark} track [record
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[racist]{.underline}**]{.mark} and sexist
**[[depictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of minoritized and colonized
peoples [[as part of]{.underline}]{.mark} a larger and **[[intentional
social engineering]{.underline}]{.mark}** project of escaping the real
world. Cutting-edge historical context this motive would practically
ensure that such films would be widely and wildly received by mainstream
audiences, which would also render such depictions innocuous, indeed,
innocent and positive.

Second, critical scholarship has shown that **[[Disney's
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** to charges of racist and sexist
representations [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[been
to]{.underline}]{.mark} apologize contritely and desist, but rather to
**[[reinvigorate]{.underline}]{.mark}** its commercial
[**[venture]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} visual
**[[storytelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**, merchandising and entertaining
advertisement (aimed at children) [[by invoking]{.underline}]{.mark} the
"**[[cultural authenticity]{.underline}]{.mark}**" of its products in
ways [[that]{.underline} **[white wash historical
violence]{.underline}**]{.mark}. This bleaching would be accomplished by
seeking out influential spokespersons of the community or people whose
cultural heritage was being mined for the next story. In this Moana, it
would be bleaching by browning, and brown facing.

Third, in the face of what will surely be a wildly entertaining and even
inspiring if entirely formulaic tale -- you know, the one about a young
and beautiful **[[native heroine]{.underline}]{.mark}** (dubbed as an
"anti-Disney Princess") and her lovable sidekick [[on a]{.underline}
**[watery]{.underline}**]{.mark} (as opposed to a frozen)
[**[quest]{.underline}** [to protect]{.underline}]{.mark} some common
good [[by defeating]{.underline} **[evil villains]{.underline}**]{.mark}
and overcoming other formidable obstacles -- the media blitz for Moana
is also promising something new, and for which this film will surely be
a box office smash and merchandising bonanza for a long long time. For
what is new here is some of the Pacific's most compelling and powerful
cultural narratives, reaching into the realm of the spiritual if not the
sacred, and bolstered by the some of the region's finest and most
exquisite talent. Unfortunately, all of this will be in the service of
same old same old.

By all available evidence, this film is going to rock with some of the
most awe-inspiring sights and sounds from and for which this magical
place called "Polynesia" has long been famous. The real world, and any
possible need to confront especially its ugliest realities, like what
America is going through right now in the 2016 Presidential Election,
stand no chance when the culturally-exotic enchantment of Polynesian
style Pacific paradise colludes with the wonderful(ly technologized)
world of Disney. And because of the likelihood of stupefying bedazzle,
we also need to remember just how insidious it can also be when that
**[[indigenously--augmented]{.underline}]{.mark}** form of
**[[imagineering]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself [[colludes
with]{.underline}]{.mark} old and new fashioned
**[[colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and postcolonialim [[in
a]{.underline} **[neoliberal age]{.underline}**]{.mark} of
globalization.

For starters, in her blog, Non Plastic Maori, Ngati Porou researcher and
activist, Tina Ngata has shown us [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} patented
[[hypocrisy of]{.underline}]{.mark} Disney's [[celebration of]{.mark}
the power of the]{.underline} Pacific **[[Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[by]{.underline} pushing and [[profiting from]{.underline} **[plastic
culture]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[constitutes]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the
[[biggest]{.underline}]{.mark} actual [[threats to]{.underline}]{.mark}
our ailing [[ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Moreover, she has called out fellow Maori film-maker, Taika Waititi, for
his role in writing the first draft of the film script. Ngata has also
challenged the arrogance of Disney's nerve to "whitesplain" traditions
of Polynesian female figures of empowerment and traditions of Polynesian
women storytelling. Also, in a dialogue with award-winning Kanaka Maoli
filmmaker, Keala Kelly, Ngata argues that, just because white
storytellers desire compelling Pacific narratives (the way colonialism
covets Native land and resources) doesn't mean they are actually
entitled to them. Moana, the Disney film, originates not from Pacific
Islander efforts to tell their own stories, but in white male writers
actively seeking out raw cultural resources for the Disney machine.

[Underpinning]{.underline} and continuing to inform [this]{.underline}
entire project [is]{.underline} an [[enduring]{.underline}]{.mark}
modern and [**[colonial desire]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[romanticized primitivism]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and a]{.underline}
**[colonial nostalgia]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[lost
innocence]{.underline}**. If romanticized primitivism describes
modernity's long-standing want for the supposedly pure and innocent way
of life said to exist in places like Polynesia, **[colonial
[nostalgia]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is the]{.underline}]{.mark} same
longing but in the form of a **[[lament over having destroyed]{.mark}
such [purity]{.mark}]{.underline}** and innocence
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} its own history of **[colonial
[encroachment]{.mark}]{.underline}** and rule in the region.

If the indefatigable desire for noble primitivism is also a desire for
the supposedly positive aspects of Polynesia, its distant cousin,
colonial nostalgia, grieves over having done things in ways that
pre-empt the possibility of actually possessing Polynesia completely.

Whatever else we can say about how colonial nostalgia works, and I'll
return to it shortly, Disney's Moana can now be recognized as a 21st
century reanimation of a romanticized longing for the powerful story of
purity and innocence of native culture and nature. That the film is set
in Oceania's pre European past is the first dead give away. The second
is the extraordinary attention paid to tropical beauty and island
paradise, to exotic culture, to the mystical, and to the sacred. A third
giveaway is a familiar cast of characters found in both the fantasy land
of Disney and in the actual history of colonial discourse in the
Pacific: beautiful young girls who are considered highly lovable for
their spunk, a supporting cast of endearing, adorable, and highly
entertaining but also menacing figures, and finally, the awe inspiring
beauty and power of tropical islands and the ocean world.

At the same time, the nostalgia featured here is also not a lament but a
[[self-congratulatory pat]{.mark} on the back that Disney gives itself
[for capturing what does survive of]{.mark} Polynesian and Pacific
[culture]{.mark} and kinship with the island and ocean worlds so that
such a power can be harnessed and shared with the rest of the ailing
world]{.underline}. But this, too, is colonial same old same old.

Hence, where Disney afficionados might find only good in noble
representations of powerful island stuff for world consumption, it is
also important to understand how **[[colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[continues to [operate through]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[benevolent
narratives]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[practices]{.underline}**. Indeed, if **[Pacific
[islanders]{.mark}]{.underline}** [have become [stereotyped
as]{.mark}]{.underline} among the **[worlds most
[friendly]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[hospitable]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} **[entertaining]{.underline}** of
**[[peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}**, they may also well be the world's
most loved-to-death people. So, add to these colonial legacies that of
Disney's aforementioned track record and its strategic and lucrative use
of "cultural authentication" and its historical sanitization effects,
and then add to that formula (enchanting spell?) [Disney's]{.underline}
other [modus operandi]{.underline} of target-advertising children [in
the manipulation of]{.underline} family **[affect]{.underline}**, and
you will begin to see just how insidious is this whole Disney ad-venture
in the Polynesian Pacific.

But all this is only half the story, for the Polynesia that is being
projected so spellbindingly on the big screen and duplicated in
merchandising is also not just western and modern colonial fantasy and
longing. [What's especially powerful]{.underline} and compelling about
this story [derives from]{.underline} its **[stamp]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[cultural authentication]{.underline}** -- another
highly fraught idea and process. Who gets to authenticate so diverse a
set of cultures and so vast a region as Polynesia and the even more
diverse and larger Pacific Island region that is also represented in
this film? And what, exactly does it mean that henceforth it is Disney
that now administrates how the rest of the world will get to see and
understand Pacific realness, including substantive cultural material
that approaches the spiritual and the sacred. Under these conditions, to
criticize Disney and its indigenous cultural experts is to come
dangerously close to criticizing the Gods and the Ancestors.
Fortunately, many of us know still know the difference, the dismissive
rhetoric of our Disney-supporting critics notwithstanding.

In fact, [Disney's]{.underline} latest bid to proceed through the
[glossy veneer of **[cultural authenticity]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[involves]{.underline}]{.mark} the creation of a (woefully misnamed)
entity called the **[[Ocean Story Trust]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [whose
members are said to be]{.underline} hand-picked **[cultural experts,
elders]{.underline}**, scholars, artists, and talent who hail from a
handful of islands in Polynesia. With one exception, no other member of
the Trust has stepped forth to answer questions or explain motives or
reasoning behind any aspect of collaborating with Disney. Until then, we
can only speculate as to who they are, how they were selected, what
kinds of compensation, monetary or otherwise, was involved, especially
when it comes to the highly politicized and contested process of
authenticating Polynesian and Pacific wide culture and tradition.

From the rumor mill and from responses to criticism, it also appears
that Disney has received the most (but not all) support from islands
that also happen to be politically independent, like Samoa and Fiji,
with lots of talent from New Zealand, as opposed to from the majority of
islands that remain colonial possessions of, or are in some kind of
neocolonial relationship with, the US, France, or nations of the British
Commonwealth. If this composition is true, this makes it a post-colonial
"Trust," one whose members are not only rumored to have signed away
rights of full disclosure to Disney, suggesting not just to whom its
members owe allegiance and accountability when it comes to having to
answer questions concerning the safeguarding of Pacific narratives and
traditions, but also a political arrangement in which the elite of a
relatively autonomous segment of a larger "nation" is able to continue
to assert its authority by actively brokering the power of culture with
the colonizing power. Such is the composition and architecture of the
"village" that it took to make this particular film. Of course, [[none
of this]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[Disney]{.underline}** in
fact **[received [proper consent]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to traffic
on]{.underline} the **[materiality]{.underline}** [it does in order to
tell]{.underline} a **[faux positive story]{.underline}**, to
commoditize islander culture and heritage into merchandising, licensing
and trademark rights to sell to the populace and to other businesses in
commercial and consumption acts that are actually damaging to psyches
and the environment.

When our elder from Mo'orea pled with Disney's agents to give Oceanic
culture just one fleeting opportunity to reverse "swallow" the west,
s/he knew exactly what she was talking about. Too much of the last five
hundred years have been spent subordinated to western colonialism in our
own islands. Our cousins from Mo'orea in French Polynesia in particular
know what it is to be "swallowed" by colonialism, beginning with formal
colonial rule continuing into the 21st century and featuring nothing
less than the insidious effects of half a century of French underwater
nuclear testing. Like plastic and other forms of man-made climate
changers, nuclear testing also kills Moana the Ocean slowly but surely.

We know, then, that colonial predators like Disney will do what it must
to take what it wants. While some Islanders have resigned themselves to
capitulating, or mitigating some of the potential damage, and others
find opportunity, handsome consultant fees and commissions, fame,
fortune and glory, a growing number of us strive to see past the veil of
enchantment and not participate in self-destruction. Far from seeing
Disney as a gold standard for powerful storytelling, [we are
**beginning** to see the **insidiousness** of **swallowing** too much
**colonial toxicity**]{.underline}, of ingesting too irradiated marine
food, of uncritical buying into Disney's happy fantasies. Why in the
world would we now wish Disneyfied culture to swallow the rest of the
world?

The tragedy in Disney's culturally fortified re-animation of
[modernity's romanticized primitivism and colonial and postcolonial
nostalgia for **purity** and **cultural alterity**]{.underline} [is that
[any real power]{.mark} that **[Moana]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
magnificent and life-giving ocean [might]{.underline} still
[[possess]{.mark} may be [dangerously close to]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[the [point of no return]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the hand-off
from]{.underline} its **[original descendants]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} its **[first stewards]{.underline}** to the beast that
blinds [with]{.underline} the most **[artificial]{.underline}** of eye
popping **[visuals]{.underline}** and extinguishes life with the most
breathtaking of sonics. So, please for the good of the world, **[don't
swallow, or be swallowed up by, Disney's version of
Moana.]{.underline}**

Domestic Realism," *Artificial Labor*, e-flux,

There has been an excess of modesty in the feminist agendas of recent
decades. Carol A. Stabile is amongst those who have been critical of an
absence of systemic thinking within postmodern feminisms, remarking upon
[a "growing [emphasis on]{.mark} **fragmentations** and
[**single-issue** **politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Stabile dismisses
this kind of thinking which, [in]{.underline} "**[so]{.underline}**
resolutely **[avoiding 'totalizing']{.underline}**---the bête noire of
contemporary critical theory---\[...\] ignores or
**[[jettisons]{.underline}]{.mark}** a [**[structural analysis]{.mark}**
of capitalism." The [difference in]{.mark} **scope** and **scale**
between that [which is]{.mark}]{.underline} being [[opposed
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} being
used [to oppose it is **[generat]{.mark}**ive of]{.underline} a sense of
**[[disempowerment]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

On the one hand, Stabile argues, [postmodern]{.underline} social
[theorists]{.underline} "[accept the **systemic** **nature** of
capitalism]{.underline}, as [made visible in its consolidation of power
and]{.underline} its [global expansion]{.underline} \[...\]
[Capitalism's power as a system is]{.underline} therefore identified and
**[named as a totality]{.underline}**"; [on the other hand, these
theorists]{.underline} "[**celebrate [local]{.mark},
[fragmented]{.mark}**, or **[partial]{.mark}**]{.underline} forms of
[**[knowledge]{.mark}** as the **only**]{.underline} forms of
[**knowledge** available" and **criticize big-picture**]{.underline}
speculative [**thinking** for its potentially oppressive
tendencies]{.underline} or applications. Nancy Fraser, too, has
addressed this apparent "shrinking of emancipatory vision at the fin de
siècle," linking this with "a major shift in the feminist imaginary"
during the 1980s and 1990s---that is, with a move away from attempting
to remake political economy (redistribution) and towards an effort at
transforming culture (recognition).

The [legacies of this]{.underline} kind of [political
theorizing]{.underline}---legacies some might describe as "folk
political"---are still being felt today, and [continue to
**shape**]{.underline} the [perceived **horizons**]{.underline} of
possibility [for progressive projects]{.underline}. Yet [these
projects]{.underline}, which are frequently valuable, necessary, and
effective on their own terms, [[are **not sufficient**]{.mark} **as ends
in themselves**]{.underline}. To the extent that they are conceptualized
in detachment from an ecology of other interventions, [operating via a
diversity of means and]{.underline} across a variety of [scales, they
cannot serve as a suitable basis for]{.underline} any
[politics]{.underline} seeking [[to contest]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[imaginaries of the right or]{.underline} to contend with [the
**[expansive]{.mark}**]{.underline} hegemonic [project of neoliberal
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is for this reason that Nick
Srnicek and Alex Williams's work positions itself as somewhat skeptical
about fragmentations and single-issue politics, pointing out that
[[problems]{.mark} such as]{.underline} "**[global
exploitation]{.underline}**, planetary **[climate change]{.underline}**,
rising surplus populations, \[[and]{.underline}\] the repeated [crises
of capitalism [are]{.mark}]{.underline} abstract in appearance,
**[complex]{.underline}** in structure, [and
**[non-localized]{.mark}**]{.underline}." As such, a [politics based
around]{.underline} the ideas that "[the local]{.underline} is ethical,
[simpler]{.underline} is better, the [organic]{.underline} is healthy,
[permanence is oppressive, and progress is over]{.underline}" [is
not]{.underline} always [the]{.underline} best [weapon]{.underline} in
an attempt [to contend with]{.underline} the **[complex technomaterial
conditions]{.underline}** of the world as it stands. [[There is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} persistent kind of [**[abstraction anxiety]{.mark}**
hanging [over progressive politics]{.mark}]{.underline}; an anxiety that
haunts a contemporary leftist feminism still unwilling or unable to
critically reappraise the tendencies that Stabile identified in the 90s.

Recently, however, [a renewed appetite for
**[ambitious]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [**[future-oriented]{.mark}
emancipatory [politics]{.mark}** has begun to make itself
felt]{.underline} at the fringes of the left---[and]{.underline} indeed,
to [[gather momentum]{.underline}]{.mark} and popular support more
broadly. Perhaps the most remarkable example of this tendency within
philosophically-inflected political theory circles has been
[accelerationism]{.underline}, with its [calls to build]{.underline} an
"**[intellectual infrastructure]{.underline}**" capable of "[creating a
**new** **ideology**, **economic** and **social** **models**, and a
**vision of the good** to replace]{.underline} and surpass [the
**emaciated** **ideals** that rule our world]{.underline} today." These
so-called ["Promethean" ideas]{.underline} have generated widespread
interest, arguably both reflecting and contributing to the changing
tenor of activist discourse. Interestingly, this term has to some extent
[emerged in **opposition** to the]{.underline} pejorative **["folk
political,"]{.underline}** acting as a shorthand for a very different
set of values and perspectives. In a recent critical piece, Alexander
Galloway suggests that "[Prometheanism" could be]{.underline} defined as
"technology for humans to overcome natural limit." Peter Wolfendale,
meanwhile, sees it as [a **"[politics of
intervention]{.mark}"**]{.underline}---one [that [starts
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the insistence that
**[[nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}** be [[**exempted** in advance]{.mark}
from]{.underline} the enactment of [re/visionary processes]{.underline}.

In its defence, UCD recognises the reality of **[[a multiplicity of

that [[the international]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the time being,
[[consists of competing states]{.underline}]{.mark} at various levels of

realistic and practical perspective on the current system which can be
utilized to overcome ecological challenges.

**[[The Arctic is a case in point]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
[[indigenous people]{.underline}]{.mark} of this vast geographical area
[[have known the impacts of external meddling]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the surrounding landscape [[for years]{.underline}]{.mark}. The issue
received particular media attention in 2016 (Vidal, 2016, Agence

exacerbating territorial rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark} [over, [and

[[Such behaviour originates from]{.mark} the [nature of the

**over nature**]{.underline} (Smith, 2008, p.61) with little regard for
posterity. As Marx and Engels (1970\[1845\], p.53) observed: "The
community... takes an independent form as the State, divorced from the
real interests of individual and community." [As long as private
property, namely the commodification of nature, is accepted and
