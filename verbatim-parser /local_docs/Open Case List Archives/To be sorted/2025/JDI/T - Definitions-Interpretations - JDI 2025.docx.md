### Means Policy

#### "Resolved" before a colon reflects a legislative forum

the list is an appositive: Each scout will carry the following: (colon)
meals for three days, a survival knife, and his sleeping bag. The
company had four new officers: (colon) Bill Smith, Frank Tucker, Peter
Fillmore, and Oliver Lewis. b.  A long quotation (one or more

### Doesn't Mean policy

#### Resolved is expressing an opinion OR taking an action even in a legislative context

**Legal Information Institute 22**, Cornell Law School,
https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/resolution)

resolution [[A resolution is a]{.underline}]{.mark} formal [[statement
of opinion **or** a decision to take an action]{.underline}]{.mark} . In
judicial proceedings , "resolution" means a judgment or decision of the
court. [[In the context of a legislative practice, "resolution" is just
a form in which a legislative body expresses an opinion or a purpose
with respect to a given]{.underline}]{.mark} matter or
[[topic]{.underline}]{.mark} that is temporary in nature. It denotes the
adoption of [[a motion]{.underline}]{.mark} , the subject-matter of
[[which does not constitute a statute]{.underline}]{.mark} .

#### Resolve means to think clearly about something

**Candler 18**, Dean, What Does It Mean to "Resolve" Something?,
https://www.cathedralatl.org/goodfaithpostings/what-does-it-mean-to-resolve-something/)

[[What does it mean to "resolve" something? It means to distinguish
particulars]{.underline}]{.mark}; it means to pay close attention. Our
best "resolutions" are about distinguishing and realizing carefully
crafted assemblies of God's beautiful creation. Once we have resolved
objects or issues, we are set free from fog and confusion. Thus, [[to
"resolve" something means to decide or determine an issue with
confidence and clarity.]{.underline}]{.mark} To "resolve" means to be
set free from doubt and uncertainty and confusing desires.

#### Resolve means to analyze the resolution not advocate it---We engage in a resistant analysis of the resolution

#### Resolve means analyze 

**The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 6**

https://www.wordnik.com/words/resolve

[[Resolve: To analyze; reduce by mental analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### It can include choosing not to do

will be reported to Planning Committees as previous .[[Resolved is

planning application received v) Relevant notice served

#### Resolve means to make a decision about

**Sentelle 7**

Judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, United States Court of Appeals FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT Argued September 24, 2007 Decided
October 26, 2007 No. 06-1354 ASSOCIATION OF CIVILIAN TECHNICIANS, NEW
YORK STATE COUNCIL, PETITIONER v. FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY,

The union reads the statute correctly. "[[Resolve" means "to reach a
decision about]{.underline}]{.mark}" or "settle." Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 1933 (1993). Under the Authority's "no
obligation" rule, however, the grievance process may end without
deciding a union's unfair labor practice claim or settling it in any
meaningful sense. The claim can simply evaporate.

### At: Resolved means reduce by mental analysis

#### This definition assumes a radically different context. It assumes a context where we were resolving something into something else---That definition occurs when we are using the word we are resolving something into something else---The first meaning is to make a decision about.

#### Dictionary.com 15 http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resolve

Resolve (**resolved**, resolving):

verb (used with object), resolved, resolving.

[1.]{.underline}

[to come to a definite or earnest decision about]{.underline}; determine
(to do something):

I have resolved that I shall live to the full.

[2.]{.underline}

[to separate]{.underline} into constituent or elementary parts; break
up; cause or disintegrate (**[usually followed by into]{.underline}**).

3\.

[to reduce or convert by]{.underline}, or as by, [breaking
up]{.underline} or disintegration (**[usually followed by to or
into]{.underline}**).

4\.

to convert or transform by any process (often used reflexively).

[5.]{.underline}

[to reduce by mental analysis]{.underline} (**[often followed by
into]{.underline}**).

6\.

opinion or intention, as of a deliberative assembly.

7\.

to deal with (a question, a matter of uncertainty, etc.) conclusively;
settle; solve:

to resolve the question before the board.

#### They pick the wrong definition---Break down by mental analysis assumes it is a verb in a sentence and it is followed by into so that it is referring to something being resolved into something else---In the resolution resolved is a noun---it is the resolution that stands on its own followed by a colon it is not modifying something else. Their defintions are verb defintions---Resolved is not a verb in the topic---It is the topic.

## Colon (:)

#### Resolved is not part of the resolution---it is a convention---what follows the colon is all that matters

**Webster's** **2k**

(Guide to Grammar and Writing ,
<http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm>)

Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a
clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting
one to go on... [If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very
brief]{.underline} and [the clause **following** the colon represents
**the real business** of the sentence]{.underline}, begin the clause
after the colon with a capital letter.

#### As defined in the Constitution

**Oxford 11** Oxford Advanced Learner\'s Dictionary 2011
http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/federal-government

[[federal government]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[(in the US) the system of government as defined in the Constitution
which is based on the separation of powers among three
branches]{.mark}:]{.underline} the executive, the legislative and the
judicial. This system provides a series of checks and balances because
each branch is able to limit the power of the others. The executive
branch consists of the President and Vice-President, based in the White
House in Washington, DC, and government departments and agencies. The
President can approve or stop laws proposed by Congress, appoints senior
officials, such as heads of government departments and federal judges,
and is also Commander-in-Chief of the military forces. There are 15
government departments, the heads of which make up the Cabinet which
meets regularly to discuss current affairs and advise the President. The
legislative branch is the Congress which is made up of the two houses,
the Senate and the House of Representatives which both meet in the
Capitol Building in Washington, DC. The main job of Congress is to make
laws, but its other responsibilities include establishing federal
courts, setting taxes and, if necessary, declaring war. The President
and members of Congress are chosen in separate elections. The Senate has
100 members, two from each state, both of whom represent the whole state
and are elected for six years. The House of Representatives has 435
members, who are elected every two years. The number of members from
each state depends on the population of the state, with larger states
divided into districts, each with one representative. The judicial
branch of government has three levels: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of
appeal and many federal district courts. The Supreme Court has nine
members, called justices who are chosen by the President and headed by
the Chief Justice. The Supreme Court has the power to influence the law
through a process called judicial review.

## Should

### Requires immediacy

**"Should" means "must" and requires immediate legal effect **

4 [The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word
\"should\"]{.underline}13 in the May 18 order connotes futurity
or [may be deemed a ruling in praesenti]{.underline}.14 The answer to
this query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be
governed by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its
immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the
critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and the same hereby is\",
(1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge
will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in
in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge\'s
intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16

not only is used as a \"present indicative\" synonymous with *ought* but

[Used in auxiliary function to express duty, obligation,

### Should can't be conditional

**"Should" is mandatory, certain and leaves no room for discretion**

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto

(Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009 People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311
(Colo. Ct. App. 2009))

\"[Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should\"]{.underline} in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence **[as synonymous with the word \"must\"]{.underline}** and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that a legislature\'s or
commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty** or
**obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

**"Should" means must -- its mandatory**

**Foresi 32**

(Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of Pennsylvania, 106 Pa.
Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239, Lexis)

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used
with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express obligation,
necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be carried
out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense that the
word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When the
judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from all
the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of
the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\' is **not
used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of \'must\', or
\'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it the sense
of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in

OF APPEALS OF IOWA 2008 Iowa App. LEXIS 287 May 14, 2008, Filed, lexis)

Clyde\'s will provides, \"in the event any of my children should
predecease me leaving issue who survive me, then the share of such
predeceased child shall go in equal shares to his or her issue who
survive me, per stirpes.\" We find no error in the district court\'s
conclusion \[\*6\] that an intent to avoid the application of the
antilapse statute is not \"clear and explicit\" from the terms of the
will. The will states \"in the event\" Clyde was predeceased by a child,
when in fact Clyde had been predeceased by two of his children at the
time the will was written. If the will was referring to the children who
had already predeceased Clyde, there would be no need to say \"in the
event.\" By stating \"in the event\" it is clear Clyde was looking ahead
to possible future events, when one of his children who were alive when
the will was written might predecease him. [Brock and Kaitlyn look to
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in the phrase \"in the event any of my
children should predecease me\" [and claim the district court improperly
found the word looked to the future.]{.underline} [They claim the word
should be interpreted as the past tense of \"shall\"]{.underline} to
imply a duty or obligation. See Black\'s Law Dictionary 1379 (6th ed.
1990). [Looking at the **phrase as a whole**, however, rather than at a
single word, we determine the phrase is considering possible future
events]{.underline}. See In re Estate of Grulke, 546 N.W.2d 626, 627

**Tee 94**, Khaw Lake Tee LLB (Mal), LLM (Monash), PhD (London)
Associate Professor, Faculty of Law University of Malaya (12/1994).
Article: THE AUTHOR\'S MORAL RIGHTS UNDER THE MALAYSIAN COPYRIGHT LAW.
The Malayan Law Journal Articles,

The second right under s 25(2) is the right to prevent, and as a
corollary, to authorize the presentation of the work in a \'modified
form\'. \'Modified form\' is not defined but it probably refers to
changes or alterations made to the work. It may also cover distortions
or mutilations done to the work. A work may also be considered to have
been modified if it is presented in a way which was not intended by the
author, for example, a tragic play being presented as a farce or when a
work is parodied or burlesqued. 25 This right is not a right to
preserve, restore or repair the work 26 nor is it a right to prevent a
destruction of the work. It is solely a right to prevent modification of
the work and even then only if the modification \'significantly alters\'
the work and is such that it might reasonably be regarded as adversely
affecting the author\'s honour or reputation. [[The word
\'significantly\' does not denote the extent of the modifications. A
modification may be slight but may be so fundamental as to alter
significantly the work,]{.underline}]{.mark} while a major modification
may not necessarily have the same effect. The important consideration is
whether the modification \'might reasonably be regarded as adversely
affecting the author\'s honour or reputation\'. This would seem to
involve an objective assessment of the effect of the modifications
although whether the court would take it upon itself to substitute its
assessment in this regard for the opinion of the author, which must
necessarily be subjective, is arguable. Copyright law has so far spared
the courts the unenviable task of deciding whether a work qualifies as a
copyright work based on its literary, artistic or musical merit or
quality. 27 It is therefore likely that in deciding whether there has
been a breach of s 25(2)(b), the court may give considerably weight to
the views of the author. In this respect, the Canadian case of Snow v
The Eaton Centre 2 is illustrative. In that case, the Ontario High Court
accepted a sculptor\'s contention that the act of a shopping centre in
putting red Christmas ribbons around the necks of his sculptured
Canadian geese was a distortion which was \'prejudicial to his honour or
reputation\' in terms of s 12(7) of the Canadian Copyright Act 1970,
cC-30. In so deciding, the court declined to delve into the question of
whether the action of the defendant did have the effect of prejudicing
the author\'s honour or reputation, preferring instead to accept the
sculptor\'s contention that it did. In Frisby v British Broadcasting
Corp, 29 the plaintiff had objected to an attempt by the British
Broadcasting Corp (\'the BBC\') to alter or omit certain words from a
play based on his script. The court, in deciding whether the alteration
was structural, 30 admitted that this was a difficult question of fact
but felt that on this matter, the plaintiff was the \'best judge\' and
accepted the plaintiff\'s evidence as to the meaning and intent, and as
to the necessity of this line in its unaltered form. 31

#### Significantly can be quantitative OR qualitative

Hence, the Panel rebuffed Korea\'s effort to have it declare illegal the
DOC\'s purely quantitative assessments, as in the Nails II Methodology

qualitative assessment]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the Panel agreed with
America that \"significance\" can be judged in purely quantitative
terms: [[because the word has two dimensions does not mean both
dimensions must be studied.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Panel cited by
analogy the 2012 Boeing case. The Appellate Body interpreted Article
6:3(c) of the SCM Agreement, which it said does not mandate evaluation
of the underlying reasons for the \"significance\" of lost sales
allegedly due to subsidized subject merchandise.

In his dissenting opinion in Thornburgh, Justice White similarly
approved of the health exception in the Pennsylvania statute that
required that a woman be exposed to a \"significantly greater medical
risk\" before she could take advantage of the exception. 276 note He
concluded that [[the word \"significantly\" could be interpreted to mean
merely a \"meaningful,\" \"cognizable,\" \"appreciable,\" or
\"non-negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}\" health risk. 277 Justice White
argued that rather than requiring a \"trade-off\" between the mother\'s
health and fetal survival, the health exception required only that the
\"risk be a real and identifiable one.\" 278 He contended that a
requirement that a \[\*1128\] risk to a woman\'s health be
\"significantly greater\" was a proper expression of the state\'s
interest in potential fetal life, and a guaranty that the state\'s
interest would not be \"subordinated to a purported maternal health risk
that is in fact wholly insubstantial.\"

#### Significantly is a low standard---it is less than materially

On the other hand, taxpayers with a sophisticated legal background (or
who have tax advisors) could conclude that [[the word
\"significantly]{.underline}]{.mark}\" in the taxpayer publication
[[creates a lower standard than the word
\"materially.]{.underline}]{.mark}\" When addressing corporations\'
internal financial reporting controls, the U.S. Securities & Exchange
Commission has defined \"[[significant deficiencies\" as lesser problems
than \"material weaknesses.]{.underline}]{.mark}\" 186 Similarly, in
merger agreements, parties can exit signed deals if they discover a
material, as opposed to a significant, adverse change, signifying again
that, for corporate law purposes, [[material is a higher standard than
significant]{.underline}]{.mark}. Using this knowledge, taxpayers with a
sophisticated legal background (or their advisors) may assume a lower
standard is required by the taxpayer publication, relative to the
standard set forth in regulations.

## Increase

### Grammatical Note---In the resolution Increase is a transitive verb. A transitive verb is a verb that has an object that receives the action. An intransitive verb is a verb that stands on its own and does not modify a noun. Exploration or Development are increased under the resolution which makes it transitive. You should use transitive definitions.

### Make Greater

#### To increase in size or intensity

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/increase

increase

#### As a transitive verb it means simple addition

#### To make greater

**Ho 17,** J.D. Former Law Clerk to Justice David H. Souter (Derek T,
Silvija A Strikis, Hilary P Gerzhoy, H Blair Hahn, and Christiaan A
Marcum; August 18; Partner at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel, & Frederick
PLLC,; Westlaw, Appellate Brief for "In Re: Lipitor (Atorvastatin
Calcium) Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation,")

The district court held Dr. DeMicco\'s admission insufficient to avoid
summary judgment because it was "at best, evidence of association, not
causation." JA2055(CMO 97, at 22); JA2155(CMO 100, at 46). That ruling
is contrary to the \*64 plain language of Dr. DeMicco\'s email. The verb
"[increase," when used in the transitive]{.underline} active voice
(i.e., with a direct object, here, "the risk") [means "to make greater"
-- i.e., to cause an increase]{.underline}d risk. See Webster\'s Third
New International Dictionary 1145 (2002). That is the very definition of
general causation. See, e.g., Kuhn v. Wyeth, Inc., 686 F.3d 618, 626
(8th Cir. 2012) (defining general causation as the requirement "that use
of \[a drug\] increases the risk of \[a disease\]"); Jenkins v. Slidella
L.L.C., No. 05-370, 2008 WL 2649510, at \*4 (E.D. La. June 27, 2008)
(defining general causation in a toxic tort as the requirement that
"exposure to the substance at issue increases the risk of a particular
injury").43

### Must Cause an Increase

#### As a transitive verb it includes causing an increase

**Goldstein et al 1, former clerk to Justice Brennan,** (Thomas C,
Jonathan S Massey, Amy Howe, George J Fowler, III, Lawrence R Demarcay;
December 4; former clerk for Judge Patricia Wald of the D.C. Circuit,
Westlaw, Appellate Brief for "Republican National Committee v. Taylor,"

The rules of grammar confirm that the Contest Statement is untruthful
because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the Bill and
Medicare increases. When a subject and verb are not followed by an
object - e.g., in the sentence, "Under the bill, Medicare spending
increases" - the verb is intransitive[. When an object follows the
verb]{.underline}- as in the Contest Statement (the "bill\...
increases\... spending on Medicare")-[the verb is
transitive.]{.underline} The definition of the intransitive verb
"increase" is "to become greater in size, amount, degree, etc.; grow."
Webster\'s New World College Dictionary 684 (3d ed. 1995). Bu[t the
definition of the transitive verb "increase"]{.underline} - the verb
used in the Contest Statement - [is "to cause to become greater in size,
amount, degree, etc.; add to; augment."]{.underline} Id. (emphasis
added). It cannot be said that the Bill would have caused Medicare
spending to become greater in size in the period from 1995 to 2002, or
that the Bill would have added to or augmented Medicare spending in
those years.

### Must Already Exist

#### 

#### Increase requires prior existence

**Buckley 6** (Jeremiah, Attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co.
of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf>)

First, the court said that the ordinary meaning of the word "increase"
is "to make something greater," which it believed should not "be limited
to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual has
previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet the definition offered
by the Ninth Circuit compels the opposite conclusion. [Because
"increase" means "to make something greater," there must necessarily
have been an existing premium]{.underline}, to which Edo's actual
premium may be compared[, to determine whether an "increase"
occurred]{.underline}. Congress could have provided that "ad-verse
action" in the insurance context means charging an amount greater than
the optimal premium, but instead chose to define adverse action in terms
of an "increase." That def-initional choice must be respected, not
ignored. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10 (1979)
("\[a\] defin-ition which declares what a term 'means' . . . excludes
any meaning that is not stated"). Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that
because the Insurance Prong includes the words "existing or applied
for," Congress intended that an "increase in any charge" for insurance
must "apply to all insurance transactions -- from an initial policy of
insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This
interpretation reads the words "exist-ing or applied for" in isolation.
Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance Prong apply
only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy of insurance,
such as a "cancellation," "reduction," or "change" in insurance. Each of
these forms of adverse action presupposes an already-existing policy,
and [under usual canons of statutory construction the term
"increase"]{.underline} also [should be construed to apply to increases
of an already-existing policy]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S.
88, 101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it")
(citation omitted).

#### 

**You can't increase something that doesn't already exist**

**Brown 3** (US Federal Judge -- District Court of Oregon (Elena Mark
and Paul Gustafson, Plaintiffs, v. Valley Insurance Company and Valley
Property and Casualty, Defendants, 7-17, Lexis)FCRA does not define the
term \"increase.\" [The]{.underline} plain and [ordinary meaning of the
verb \"to increase\" is to make something greater]{.underline} or
larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\] Collegiate Dictionary 589 (10th
ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is increased in the statute is the
\"charge for any insurance.\" The plain and common meaning of the noun
\"charge\" is \"the price demanded for something.\" Id. at 192. Thus,
the statute plainly means an insurer takes adverse action if the insurer
makes greater (i.e., larger) the price demanded for insurance.[An
insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did not exist
previously]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

### Does Not Require Prior Existence

Division of St. Thomas and St. John, "AGF Marine Aviation & Transp. v.
Cassin, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90808," Lexis)//BB

The Court inadvertently used the word \"his\" when the Court intended to
use [the word \"its.\"]{.underline} [The **possessive**
pronoun]{.underline} was [intended to refer to the party preceding its
use]{.underline}\--AGF. Indeed, that reference is consistent with the
undisputed facts in this case, which indicate that Cassin completed an
application for the insurance policy and submitted it to his agent,
Theodore Tunick & Company (\"Tunick\"). Tunick, in turn, submitted the
application to AGF\'s underwriting agent, TL Dallas. (See Pl.\'s Mem. of
Law in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 5.)

**'Its' is a possessive pronoun showing ownership**

**Supreme Court of Oklahoma 34**

(Swindall v. State Election Board, 168 Okla. 97, Lexis)//BB

However, I view another phase of the act which is not considered in the
majority opinion. It is my opinion that the expression, \"its
nominees,\" should have been construed by this court. Had this court so
construed those words, it would have assisted the State Election Board
in the furtherance of its ministerial duties, and would have set to rest
the immediate question. It is my theory that the correct interpretation
to place upon those words, \"its nominees,\" is to the effect that those
words do not mean all the nominees of any particular party. [The word
\"its\" is the possessive case]{.underline}, or the possessive adjective
[of \"it\", meaning]{.underline} of or **[belonging to
it.]{.underline}** Webster\'s International Dictionary. In other words,
the expression, \"its nominees,\" as applied to the Republican party,
means nominees of it (the Republican party). The words, \"nominees\" of
the \"Republican party,\" do not and necessarily cannot mean all the
nominees of the Republican party. Those words, however, do mean more
than one nominee. It seems reasonable to conclude, in the absence of an
expression like \"all of its nominees,\" or words of similar import,
that it was not the intent of the Legislature to make those words, \"its
nominees,\" all inclusive. It seems to me that a fair and reasonable
interpretation would be that those words support and embrace the thought
expressed by the New York statute, to wit, that it is the intention of
the candidate to support generally at the next general election the
nominees of the party from which he seeks his nomination, or that it is
his intention to support a majority of the candidates of that party.

**If other actors would [possess]{.underline} and
[maintain]{.underline}-- that violates the core meaning of "its"**

**Appelate Court of Illinois 80**

("Hulett v. Central Illinois Light Co.," 83 Ill. App. 3d 195, Lexis)//BB

The plaintiff responded to the motion for summary judgment to the effect
that as to who owned or controlled the wires is immaterial, since CILCO
was required to maintain and inspect all electric supply lines carrying
its electricity and had failed to do so. In support of this contention
the plaintiff relies upon Illinois Commerce Commission General Order 160
\-- Revised, and effective as of June 1, 1963, which provides as
follows:

\"9. General Maintenance Requirements.

[Each public utility]{.underline} operating a system of power or
communication lines [shall maintain *its* \[italics in original\]
system]{.underline} of lines in such condition as will enable it to
furnish safe, adequate and dependable service.

Power and communication lines and their associated equipment shall
comply with the provisions of this General Order when placed in service,
and shall thereafter by systematically inspected, and when necessary, be
subjected to tests to determine their fitness for the service required
of them, and for conditions of safety. Any defects revealed by such
inspections and tests which could cause or create an unsafe condition,
shall be promptly corrected. If such corrections are not immediately
undertaken, a record of the condition found shall be made in the proper
plant office of the utility. Defective lines or their associated
equipment shall be placed in good operating condition, or otherwise
effectively disconnected or removed.\" (Emphasis added.)

The purport of the trial judge\'s order is to this court clear in that a
question of law is presented, namely, whether or not the Commerce
Commission General Order 160 places a duty upon CILCO to maintain,
repair and inspect the electrical lines in question, even though they
are not and never have been owned or controlled by the power company. We
note, however, that the plaintiff attempts to challenge the sufficiency
of the Volk affidavit which denies ownership or control of the lines by
CILCO. It is the plaintiff\'s argument that the affidavit referred to
records as to premises located at 821 Tremont Township, Tremont,
Illinois, and that the described premises have not been established as
the place where the plaintiff was injured. We find no merit in this
contention since it is \[198\] patently clear from the record that there
was no concern on the part of the trial court or the parties to this
action concerning the Volk affidavit or where the plaintiff was injured.
It should be noted that the plaintiff did not file a counteraffidavit
and consequently admitted that CILCO did not own or control the
electrical line. (See Carruthers v. B. C. Christopher & Co. (1974), 57
Ill. 2d 376, 313 N.E.2d 457.) To raise on appeal the question of
ownership appears to be an effort on the part of the plaintiff to
obfuscate the true issue, to-wit, the meaning and effect of General
Order 160.

We have set forth the pertinent provisions of the order and [attention
should be directed to the word **its** located in the first paragraph
and which we have emphasized. The word its as used is a pronoun and is
being used in its **possessive** form. By the use of the word it is
clear that each public utility]{.underline} system [shall]{.underline}
**[maintain]{.underline}** the power [lines which it
**owns**]{.underline}.

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id

This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that the agreement
(contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement (contract) between
Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other words, to accept AT&T's
argument the Commission must conclude that two separate contracts, i.e.
the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in Kentucky ("Sprint
Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between Cricket and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and the same.

Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that "***the
ICA*** was already extended"; id. at 14, and "***the ICA*** Cricket
seeks to extend was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and,
finally, "Cricket cannot extend ***the same ICA*** a second time . . .
." Id. (emphasis added in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the
AT&T brief (and elsewhere) [[AT&T uses vague]{.mark} and imprecise
[language]{.mark}]{.underline} when referring to either the Sprint
Kentucky Agreement, or the Cricket Kentucky Agreement, [i[n hopes that
the Commission will treat the two contracts as]{.underline}]{.mark} one
and [[the same]{.underline}.]{.mark}

But it would be a mistake to do so. The contract governing AT&T's duties
and obligations with Sprint is a legally distinct and separate contract
from that which governs AT&T's duties with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky
Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2001 in Case
Number 2000-00480. The Cricket Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2008 in Case Number 2008-033 1.

[[AT&T ignores]{.underline}]{.mark} the fact [[that these are two
separate and distinct contracts because it knows that the merger
commitments apply to ***each*** agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} that an
individual telecommunications carrier has with AT&T. Notably, Merger
Commitment 7.4 states that "AT&T/BellSouth ILECs shall permit ***a
requesting telecommunications carrier*** to extend ***its*** current
interconnection agreement . . . . As written, [[the commitment allows
any carrier to extend "***its***" agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Clearly, the use of the pronoun [["its"]{.underline}]{.mark} in this
context [[is possessive]{.underline}]{.mark}, such that [[the term "its"
means - ***that*** particular carrier's agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}
with AT&T **[([and not any other carrier's
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}**). Thus, the merger commitment applies
to each agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It
necessarily follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement
under Merger Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another
carrier's right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such
agreement has been extended).

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also

Substantively, Norfolk seeks this Court\'s endorsement of City of
Chester\'s ownership litmus for transportation utilities. Norfolk
believes that the ownership focus arises out of Section 2702(a) of the
Public Utility Code, which establishes the PUC\'s jurisdiction over
rail-highway crossings in the first instance, *see* 66 Pa.C.S. §
2702(a), and in light of which, Norfolk asserts, Section 2704(a) must be
read. Norfolk contends that [[Section 2702(a) limits]{.mark} the PUC\'s
[jurisdiction to]{.mark} allocate costs associated with crossing
projects only to a transportation utility which has constructed \"[its
facilities]{.mark}\" across a highway or where a highway has been
constructed across \"the facilities of any such public
utility]{.underline},\" 66 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a). *See* Brief for Norfolk at

that **only** transportation utilities that ***own*** facilities at

[subject to cost allocation.\").]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, as the
County presaged, Norfolk relies upon this Court\'s conclusion in
*Pittsburgh Railways* that \"\[t\]he transportation utilities
*\[c\]oncerned* for purposes of assessment under \[Section 2704(a)\'s

at 428, 161 A. at 424 (\"It is the presence and ownership of the track

this line of authority.

(David, ALI-ABA COURSE OF STUDY MATERIALS Environmental Impact
Assessment: NEPA and Related Requirements Cosponsored by the
Environmental Law Institute, Lexis)//BB

I. Issue¶ - [At what point does federal participation in a project
contemplated by a nonfederal entity, such as a private
entity]{.underline} or a state or local government, [federalize the
action]{.underline} and render the entire project subject to the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\")?¶ - The
way in which an action is defined determines the scope of the project
for federal purposes.¶ - Nonfederal actions are not subject to NEPA
requirements. Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 610
F.2d 322, 326 (5th Cir. 1980); Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation
Assoc. v. Gettysburg College, 799 F. Supp. 1571, 1577 (M.D. Pa.
1992).¶ - Federal agencies are subject to NEPA requirements if a
proposed project involves a \"major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)
(C).¶ - If subject to NEPA requirements, the federal agency must conduct
an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") and issue a Finding of No
Significant Impact (\"FONSI\") or an Environmental Impact Statement
(\"EIS\").¶ - The NEPA scope of analysis is significant because:¶ - It
is frequently determinative of the need for an EIS.¶ - Because NEPA
applies to at least the federal component of a proposal, the greater the
\"federalization\" of the action the greater the likelihood of
significant environmental impacts.¶ - Inclusion of the nonfederal
portion of a proposed project as part of the NEPA scope of analysis
often converts a typical FONSI into an EIS.¶ - Federal agencies must
comply with the alternatives analysis in Section 102(2) (E) even if they
do not have to prepare an EIS. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2) (E); Hanly v.
Kleindienst (II), 471 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S.
908 (1973).¶ - Inclusion of the nonfederal portion of a proposed project
as part of the NEPA scope of analysis increases the scope of the
alternatives analysis because the federal agency must consider
alternatives to the entire project, not just alternatives to the federal
portion of the proposed project.¶ - Inclusion of the nonfederal
component of a proposal as part of the overall federal action may
trigger other additional provisions of federal law, such as¶ - § 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. § 470f.¶ - Floodplain
Management, Executive Order No. 11988.¶ - Protection of Wetlands,
Executive Order No. 11990 (does not apply to issuance by federal
agencies of permits to private parties for activities involving wetlands
on nonfederal property).¶ - If more than one federal agency is involved
in a project proposed by a nonfederal entity, the federal agencies must
consider the cumulative federal involvement in determining the scope of
the NEPA analysis. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.7 & 1508.25(a) & (c).¶ II.
Common Situations Involving the \"Small Handle\" Issue¶ - Nonfederal
actions that require federal permits or approvals.¶ - Army Corps of
Engineers\' (the \"Corps\") issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 10
of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. § 403, for work in navigable
waters of the United States and/or pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, for discharges of fill or dredged material
into waters of the United States (including federal wetlands).¶ -
Construction of marina associated with upland development (e.g.,
commercial or residential).¶ - Construction of marina associated with
entertainment facilities.¶ - Components of a residential or commercial
development are in both upland and regulated waters.¶ - Other
combinations of in-water activity and upland activity:¶ - Utility
lines.¶ - River or wetlands crossing or filling as part of a larger
development or transportation project.¶ - Discharge outfalls from upland
industrial plant.¶ - Secretary of the Interior approval of Indian
contracts.¶ - Local road improvements associated with highway
improvements requiring Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA\")
approvals or funding.¶ - Nonfederal actions eligible for federal
assistance.¶ - Mass transit systems.¶ - Highway construction.¶ - Housing
developments.¶ - HUD mortgage insurance.¶ - HUD funding for a portion of
a project.¶ III. How To Determine When A Nonfederal Action Has Been
Federalized¶ - There are no clear standards for determining the point at
which federal involvement transforms a nonfederal project into federal
action. United States v. Southern Florida Water Management District, 28
F.3d 1563, 1572 (11th Cir. 1994). \"The touchstone of major federal
activity constitutes a federal agency\'s authority to influence
nonfederal activity.\" Id.; Sierra Club v. Hodel, 848 F.2d 1068, 1089
(10th Cir. 1988); see 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18. Put another way, does the
federal agency\'s involvement provide it with the ability to influence
materially the environmental impacts of the planned non-federal
activity?¶ - The Corps follows its own NEPA regulations. In 1980, the
Corps published a version of regulations that did not specify how it
should determine the scope of its NEPA analysis when issuing permits for
actions combining both federal and nonfederal components. In the same
year, the Fifth and Eighth Circuits decided to limit this scope to the
federally controlled or regulated aspects of such projects. These
immediately following Fifth and Eighth Circuit seminal cases addressed
the \"small handle\" issue and provide the essential historical
antecedents for the promulgation of the Corps\' Scope of Analysis
regulations, 33 C.F.R. § 325, App. B(7)(b) (1994).¶ - Winnebago Tribe of
Nebraska v. Ray (\"Winnebago\"), 621 F.2d 269 (8th Cir. 1980). A
nonfederal proposal was made to construct a 67-mile power line.
Approximately 1.25 miles of the 67-mile power line would cross the
Missouri River, triggering the need for a Corps Section 10 permit,
pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 403. Before issuing the permit, the Corps
prepared an EA on the impact of the 1.25 mile river crossing. The EA
concluded that there were no significant environmental impacts
associated with the river crossing; thus, an EIS was not required.¶
Plaintiff then commenced a lawsuit, alleging noncompliance with NEPA
because the Corps did not assess the environmental effects of the entire
67-mile power line. Plaintiff argued that without the Section 10 permit,
the power line would not be built; therefore, the Corps had sufficient
control over the proposal to require an environmental analysis of the
entire transmission line project, which would undoubtedly require an
EIS.¶ The District Court denied the plaintiff\'s request for a permanent
injunction to bar the construction of the proposed power line. The
plaintiff appealed from that decision, arguing, inter alia, that the
District Court had erred in holding that the issuance of a Corps permit
to cross the Missouri River was not a \"major federal action\" within
the meaning of NEPA.¶ In reviewing the District Court decision, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (\"Court\")
employed both an \"enablement\" (or legal control) and a factual (or
veto control) test in determining whether the Corps should have
considered the environmental impacts of the entire project. The Court
stated that in \"enablement\" cases, \"federal action is a legal
condition precedent to accomplishment of an entire nonfederal project.\"
Id. at 272. The Court found that 33 U.S.C. § 403 was too narrow to be
construed as a grant of legal control over the entire project.¶ The
Court then looked to the Corps\' factual, or veto control, over the
project. In applying this test, it articulated three factors to aid in
determining whether the Corps\' factual control required an
environmental assessment of the entire project:¶ (1) the degree of
discretion exercised by the agency over the federal portion of the
project;¶ (2) whether the federal government has given any direct
financial aid to the project; and¶ (3) whether \"the overall federal
involvement with the project \[is\] sufficient to turn essentially
private action into federal action.\"¶ Id. The Court stated that,
although the Corps had broad discretion to assess environmental impacts,
the discretion had to be exercised within the scope of the agency\'s
authority. Under Section 10, the Corps had authority to consider the
environmental impacts regarding only areas in and affecting navigable
waters. Thus, the Corps had no authority to consider the environmental
impacts of the entire proposed 67-mile power line. The Court also found
that the federal government was not providing any direct or indirect
funding for the project. Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that
the Corps did not have sufficient control or responsibility to require
an environmental assessment of the entire project.¶ - Save the Bay, Inc.
v. United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"Save the Bay\"), 610 F.2d
322 (5th Cir. 1980). A nonfederal proposal to construct and operate a
massive titanium dioxide manufacturing facility involved issuance of a
Corps permit for the construction of a 2200-foot, 24\" pipeline to
discharge 2 million gallons per day of industrial wastewater into the
Bay of St. Louis. The Corps prepared an EA, issued a Statement of
Findings with the conclusion that there would be no adverse effects on
air quality and only temporary effects on water quality, and issued the
permit authorizing building the outfall pipeline.¶ Plaintiffs initiated
a lawsuit, arguing that the grant of the pipeline construction permit
was a \"major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment\" and required preparation of an EIS. The District
Court, however, concluded that the EA was reasonable and based on
substantial evidence and that the Corps was not required to consider the
environmental consequences of the entire project, but only the effects
of the construction and maintenance of the outfall pipe. Thus, the
District Court found that the activity was not a major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Plaintiffs
then appealed the district court decision. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (\"Court\") held that issuance of the
Corps permit for the outfall pipe was not a sufficient nexus between the
Corps and the construction of the plant to make the agency a partner in
such construction and thereby \"federalize\" its construction, i.e., the
grant of the pipeline construction permit was not a \"major federal
action\" within the meaning of NEPA. The Court found that, in granting
the permit, the Corps was limited to considering the environmental
effects of the construction and operation of the pipeline itself. The
environmental consequences of the effluent were a factor to be excluded
from the Corps consideration.¶ The Court also noted that the pipeline
was not necessary to operate the plant; another method of discharge, not
requiring a Corps permit, was available. Although disclaiming the
adoption of a \"but for\" text, the Court found that there was
insufficient federal involvement to \"federalize\" construction of the
industrial plant.¶ - In 1984, the Corps proposed an amendment to its
NEPA regulations that would have codified Winnebago and Save the Bay.
The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"),
pursuant to the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7609(a) (1982) must review
proposed NEPA compliance regulations. The Administrator did not approve
the Corps\' amendment, and, therefore, the proposed regulation was
referred to the Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\"). 42 U.S.C. §
7609(b) (1982). On June 8, 1987, the CEQ approved the amendment subject
to a few proposed modifications. 52 Fed. Reg. 225120-22 (1987). On
February 3, 1988, the Corps revised and published the amendment; the
revision adopted the CEQ\'s proposals. 53 Fed. Reg. 3120, 3121 (1988).
This Corps regulation, set forth in pertinent part below, represents the
most systematic effort to address the \"small handle\" issue:¶ - Corps
Scope of Analysis: (1) In some situations, a permit applicant may
propose to conduct a specific activity requiring a Department of the
Army (DA) permit (e.g., construction of a pier in a navigable water of
the United States) which is merely one component of a larger project
(e.g., construction of an oil refinery on an upland area). The district
engineer should establish the scope of the NEPA document (e.g., the EA
or EIS) to address the impacts of the specific activity requiring a DA
permit and those portions of the entire project over which the district
engineer has sufficient control and responsibility to warrant Federal
review.¶ (2) The district engineer is considered to have control and
responsibility for portions of the project beyond the limits of Corps
jurisdiction where the Federal involvement is sufficient to turn an
essentially private action into a Federal action. These are cases where
the environmental consequences of the larger project are essentially
products of the Corps permit action.¶ Typical factors to be considered
in determining whether sufficient \"control and responsibility\" exists
include:¶ (i) Whether or not the regulated activity comprises \"merely a
link\" in a corridor type project (e.g., a transportation or utility
transmission project).¶ (ii) Whether there are aspects of the upland
facility in the immediate vicinity of the regulated activity which
affect the location and configuration of the regulated activity.¶
(iii)The extent to which the entire project will be within Corps
jurisdiction.¶ (iv) The extent of cumulative Federal control and
responsibility.¶ A. Federal control and responsibility will include the
portions of the project beyond the limits of Corps jurisdiction where
the cumulative Federal involvement of the Corps and other Federal
agencies is sufficient to grant legal control over such additional
portions of the project. These are cases where the environmental
consequences of the additional portions of the projects are essentially
products of Federal financing, assistance, direction, regulation, or
approval (not including funding assistance solely in the form of general
revenue sharing funds, with no Federal agency control over the
subsequent use of such funds, and not including judicial or
administrative civil or criminal enforcement actions).¶ B . . . .¶ C . .
. .¶ (3) . . . . In any case, once the scope of analysis has been
defined, the NEPA analysis for that action should include direct,
indirect and cumulative impacts on all Federal interests within the
purview of the NEPA statute. The district engineer should, whenever
practicable, incorporate by reference and rely upon the review of other
Federal and State agencies.¶ 33 C.F.R. § 325, App. B, § (7) (b) (1994).¶
The Corps regulations also provide certain examples of common permitting
actions that may implicate the \"small handle\" issue. In Montrose
Parkway Alternatives Coalition v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 405
F.Supp.2d 587 (D. Md. 2005), the plaintiffs challenged the Corps\'
failure to prepare an EIS for a locally planned and financed highway
project, for which a Corps permit was needed to fill 0.94 acres of
federal wetlands. The Corps limited the scope of its Environmental
Assessment to the area of filling and the area of roadway immediately on
either side of it. In doing so the Corps relied on one of the examples
in its regulations, which provide:¶ For those regulated activities that
comprise merely a link in a transportation or utility transmission
project, the scope of analysis should address the Federal action, i.e.,
the specific activity requiring a DA permit and any other portion of the
project that is within the control or responsibility of the Corps of
Engineers (or other Federal agencies).¶ For example, a 50-mile
electrical transmission cable crossing a 1 1/4 mile wide river that is a
navigable water of the United States requires a DA permit. Neither the
origin and destination of the cable nor its route to and from the
navigable water, except as the route applies to the location and
configuration of the crossing, are within the control or responsibility
of the Corps of Engineers. Those matters would not be included in the
scope of analysis which, in this case, would address the impacts of the
specific cable crossing.¶ 325 C.F.R. § 325, App. B, § 7(b)(3). The court
held that the Corps\' regulations were entitled to deference, and found
that the case at issue resembled the example quoted. On the plaintiffs\'
motion for preliminary injunction, the court held that the Corps\'
regulations \"expressly contemplate the appropriate scope of the Corps\'
environmental review for this type of construction and state that
projects such as \[this\] are not federalized.\" 405 F.Supp.2d at 599.
Thus, it held that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits
of the action and denied the motion.¶ Judicial reliance on the Corps\'
regulations has also had the contrary result: nullification of the
Corps\' determination of the appropriate scope of analysis where it does
not comport with the regulations. Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition v.
United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"Ohio Valley Environmental
Coalition\"), 479 F.Supp.2d 607 (S.D. W. Va. 2007), involved a
mountaintop removal coal mining operation for which Corps approval was
needed to fill streams in the adjacent valleys with mining overburden.
The Corps limited the scope of its NEPA analysis to effects on the
jurisdictional waters. The court held that while the actual mining
portion of the project was properly excluded from the analysis, the
Corps improperly failed to examine effects on the wooded valleys that
were being filled along with the streams. The Court based its holding on
one of the examples provided in the Corps regulations, which provides:
\"\[i\]f an applicant seeks a DA permit to fill waters or wetlands on
which other construction or work is proposed, the control and
responsibility of the Corps, as well as its overall Federal involvement
would extend to the portions of the project to be located on the
permitted fill.\" 33 CFR § 325, App. B § 7(b)(3).¶ Similarly, in
Baykeeper v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2006 WL 2711547 (E.D. Cal.
Sept. 20, 2006), the court invoked another example from the Corps\'
regulations in holding that the agency\'s NEPA analysis for a dredging
project was inappropriately circumscribed. In that case, the Port of
Stockton sought a Section 10 permit to dredge the berthing areas for two
docks, which the Corps characterized as a \"demonstration project\" to
help gauge the potential ecological impacts of dredging several other
berthing areas, for the ultimate purpose of greatly expanding the
Port\'s operations. In its NEPA assessment, the Corps only examined the
effects of this initial phase of dredging. The court granted a
preliminary injunction enjoining the dredging on the basis that the
plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their
claim that the Corps should have assessed the impacts of the entire port
expansion project.¶ One critical basis for the court\'s decision was
another example in the Corps\' regulations, providing:¶ \[A\] shipping
terminal normally requires dredging, wharves, bulkheads, berthing areas
and disposal of dredged material in order to function. Permits for such
activities are normally considered sufficient Federal control and
responsibility to warrant extending the scope of analysis to include the
upland portions of the facility.¶ 33 C.F.R. § 325, App. B § 7(b)(3). The
court additionally noted that EPA and the National Marine Fisheries
Service, in commenting on the application, had requested that the Corps
look at the entire project in one integrated analysis and that the
Corps\' own statements reflected the fact that the initial round of
dredging was for the purpose of enabling the larger project (thus
refuting the Corps\' \"post-hoc\" assertion that the dredging activities
had an independent utility).¶ The Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition
court distinguished, on the basis of the magnitude of the fill involved,
a case in which the court refused to hold the Corps to the
\"construction over filled areas\" example, Sierra Club v. U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, 450 F.Supp.2d 503 (D.N.J. 2006). That case involved
a large commercial development which would require filling of a total of
7.69 acres of dispersed wetlands (8% of the total project area). The
Corps limited its NEPA analysis to impacts on the wetlands from the
filling, and did not analyze the effects of the overall project or even
those portions of the project that would be constructed on filled areas.
The court upheld the Corps\' FONSI against the plaintiff\'s argument
that the Corps regulations themselves required such an analysis,
holding:¶ Contrary to the Army Corps\'s interpretation and application
of its own regulations, under Plaintiffs\' interpretation a provision
that is plainly set forth merely as an \"example\" would control the
outcome in effectively all cases where a permit applicant proposes to
conduct activities requiring a permit as a component of a larger
project. Such an interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the
regulations \[which\] require \"careful analysis of all facts and
circumstances surrounding the relationship.\"¶ Id., 450 F.Supp.2d at
518. While not relying on it as a factor in its decision, the court did
note the fact that the project had already been subject to an extensive
state EIS.¶ - The CEQ regulations afford only limited guidance for
determining the appropriate scope of analysis. They define \"major
Federal action\" to include:¶ actions with effects that may be major and
which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility.
Major reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of
significantly (§ 1508.27). Actions include the circumstance where the
responsible officials fail to act and that failure to act is reviewable
by courts or administrative tribunals under the Administrative Procedure
Act or other applicable law as agency action.¶ (a) Actions include new
and continuing activities, including projects and programs entirely or
partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal
agencies; new or revised agency rules, regulations, plans, policies, or
procedures; and legislative proposals (§§ 1506.8, 1508.17). Actions do
not include funding assistance solely in the form of general revenue
sharing funds, distributed under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance
Act of 1972, 31 U.S.C. 1221 et seq., with no Federal agency control over
the subsequent use of such funds.¶ 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18 (1994). This
definition has been found to be entitled to substantial deference. Save
Barton Creek Ass\'n v. Federal Highway Admin., 950 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th
Cir. 1992).¶ IV. Judicial Application Of Scope of Analysis Factors¶ -
\"Reasonably close causal relationship\"¶ - Only environmental effects
that have a \"reasonably close causal relationship\", akin to proximate
cause in tort law, with the federal agency\'s determination need be
considered in determining whether an EIS is needed. Those effects which
the federal agency has no power to prevent are not \"effects\" of the
federal action that would enter this analysis. Department of
Transportation v. Public Citizen (\"Public Citizen\"), 541 U.S. 752, 124
S.Ct. 2204 (2004).¶ - \"Enablement\" or Legal Control v. Veto or Factual
Control¶ - Enablement or legal control occurs when the federal action is
a legal precedent to accomplishing the nonfederal project. Landmark
West! v. United States Postal Service (\"Landmark West!\"), 840 F. Supp.
994 (S.D.N.Y. 1993), aff\'d, 41 F.3d 1500 (2d Cir. 1994); Goos v.

F.2d 1305 (8th Cir. 1987) (no federal action was a legal condition
precedent to construction of parking ramp next to Indian bingo
facility).¶ - In cases involving issuance of a permit by the Corps
pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. § 403,
n1 the issuance of the permit cannot be construed to provide legal
control over the entire project. Save Our Wetlands, Inc. v. Sands, 711
F.2d 634, 644 n.9 (5th Cir. 1983).¶ - The same analysis applies to cases
involving issuance of a Corps permit pursuant to Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. Macht v. Skinner, 916 F.2d 13 (D.C.
Cir. 1990) (where state light rail project required Section 404 permit
to cross wetlands, Corps\' ability to prevent the proposed route
insufficient to federalize project, even coupled with additional federal
funding for preliminary engineering studies and state EIS\'s).¶ - To
determine whether the federal agency has veto or factual control over
the nonfederal project, the judiciary has identified four somewhat
overlapping factors:¶ - the degree of discretion exercised by the agency
over the nonfederal portion of the project, Save Barton Creek Assoc. v.
Federal Highway Admin., 950 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir. 1992);¶ - whether
the federal government has given any direct financial aid to the
nonfederal project, Save Barton Creek Assoc. v. Federal Highway Admin.,
950 F.2d 1129, 1135 (5th Cir. 1992);¶ - where federal funding of a
non-federal project is \"active,\" or \"programmatic,\" and provided in
furtherance of a funding agency\'s goals, it is more likely to be
accompanied by indicia of control sufficient to federalize, the project.

\- Citizens Alert Regarding the Environment, 102 Fed.Appx. 167, 2004 WL
1336644 (D.C. Cir. June 15, 2004). [The plaintiffs sought an injunction
to prohibit the construction of a sewer pipeline]{.underline} by the
Jefferson Township Sewer Authority [until after EPA completed its
review]{.underline} of the project pursuant to NEPA. [The federal action
in question was a proposed]{.underline} \$ 1.5 million [grant from
EPA]{.underline}. Most funding for the \$ 15 million project had come
from the State of Pennsylvania, which in turn had received a grant
through a state-administered revolving fund program funded by EPA.

At the time of the suit, EPA\'s direct grant had not yet been issued
pending review of the project under NEPA. The Authority decided to begin
construction, using the state revolving fund grant. Plaintiffs sought an
injunction barring any construction until EPA completed its NEPA review.

[The D.C. Circuit held that EPA\'s participation was not substantial
enough to federalize the entire project. First]{.underline}, with
respect to the state revolving fund, **[EPA lacked substantial
control]{.underline}** over the distribution of funds by the state. The
plaintiffs challenged EPA\'s approval of Pennsylvania\'s program for
disbursing the funds, but this challenge was time-barred under the
six-year statute of limitations for actions against the United States,
as the approval had occurred in 1991.

[The court went on to hold that the direct grant by EPA was also
**insufficient to federalize the project,** because the withholding of
the grant would present no legal impediment to the sewer]{.underline}
pipeline, which was under the discretionary jurisdiction of state and
local agencies. Nor would the denial of the funding prevent construction
of the sewer line as a practical matter, as it represented only a small

It is true that the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, Title 42 U.S.C. §
1416, expands the coverage of the Bacon-Davis Act to \"contracts in
connection with the development or administration of Federal projects
and the furnishing of materials and labor for such projects\" (emphasis
by the Court). [42 U.S.C. § 1402]{.underline}(7) [defines a \"federal
project\" as \"any project owned]{.underline} or administered [by the
Authority]{.underline}\", and the \"Authority\" is defined to mean \"the
United States Housing Authority\", 42 U.S.C. § 1402(13), now known as
the Public Housing Authority (\"PHA\"). 2 The [construction]{.underline}
of the improvements on the properties known as Eastlake and Southbridge

the United States Housing Act of 1937. [However, the project was **not

of the Bacon-Davis Act) applied.¶ The claimants concede that the project
is not owned by the PHA. They maintain, however, that the project is
administered by the PHA. This argument that the project is administered
by the PHA finds four-square refutation in the fact that the PHA
rendered financial assistance to the WHA. This was authorized by the
Public Housing Act only if the project was to be administered by the
WHA. 42 U.S.C. § 1402(11) provides:¶ \"The Authority shall enter into
contracts for financial assistance with a State or State agency where
such State or State agency makes application for such assistance for an
eligible project which, under the applicable laws of the State, is to be
developed and administered by such State or State agency.\"¶ Since
federally-assisted housing projects must be projects \"administered\" by
state and local housing authorities such as WHA, these projects are not
\"federal projects\" within the meaning of the Housing Act. [Several

### Seeking information or knowledge

#### Includes gathering information

**Adolph et al 2K,** New York University (Karen E. Adolph, Marion A.
Eppler, Ludo Marin, Idell B. Weise, Melissa Wechsler Clearfield,
Exploration in the service of prospective control, Infant Behavior and
Development, Volume 23, Issues 3--4, 2000, Pages 441-460, ISSN
0163-6383, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0163-6383(01)00052-2.
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638301000522)

Exploration is the key to prospective control. One of the Gibsons'
Gibson 1969, Gibson 1979 important insights is that exploratory
movements are the link in the perception-action chain. Here[[, we define
exploration as movements which generate information or allow the
perceiver to gather information relevant for planning future
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Exploratory movements must be
self-initiated (e.g., information generated from passive locomotion
while an infant is being carried is not, by definition, the result of
exploration). Exploratory movements include varying levels of attention.
On one extreme of inattentiveness is spontaneous wiggles, thrashes, and
stereotypies which generate information about the position of the limbs
and body relative to gravity and the supporting surface. On the other
extreme of focused attention are concerted, directed movements produced
expressly for the purpose of generating or gathering additional
information about possibilities for action. Situated somewhere in the
middle of this continuum are casual exploratory scans (e.g., visual
exploration while walking along an open road) and information generating
movements which are the byproduct of another ongoing action (the walking
movements themselves generate visual flow, vestibular, and kinesthetic
information about the status of the body relative to the environment).

#### Exploration means pursuit of knowledge

**Parker et al 25**, Durham University Business Schhol, Durham
University, (Andrew Parker, Christian Waldstrøm, Stefano Tasselli, The
effect of perceptions of exploration and exploitation work activities on
dynamic organizational knowledge networks, Social Networks, Volume 82,
2025, Pages 201-212, ISSN 0378-8733,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2025.04.004.
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873325000218)

This paper addresses the lack of research on how perceptions of the
characteristics of work influences the dynamics of network choices. For
characteristics of work, we take as our starting point exploration and
exploitation in organizations (March, 1991). While the two concepts
originally focused on the strategies of firms (Benner and Tushman, 2003,
Ghemawat and Ricart Costa, 1993), business units (e.g., Gibson and
Birkinshaw, 2004), and teams (Hansen et al., 2001), they are also
relevant to how individuals engage with work in organizations. [[We
define exploration as "the pursuit of new knowledge, of things that
might come to be known"]{.mark} and exploitation as "the use and
development of things already known"]{.underline} (Levinthal and March,
1993, p. 105). At the individual level, there is burgeoning research on
how these two concepts contribute to the understanding of people's work
activities and how they relate to patterns of action and interaction in
organizational networks (Mom et al., 2007). From an intra-organizational
network perspective, we examine the links between how individuals engage
with work and the dynamics of individuals' knowledge networks (Argote
and Ingram, 2000, Kogut and Zander, 1992, Phelps et al., 2012). We
suggest different mechanisms linking the two work characteristics with
the network dynamics of knowledge seeking in organizations. Knowledge
networks are important in this context because individuals who perceive
their work as having a high versus low opportunity for exploration see
knowledge as a source of novel ideas (e.g., Burt, 2004); for those who
perceive their work as having a high versus low opportunity for
exploitation, knowledge is also important because it is associated with
improved processes and communication, which are specially relevant in
organizational contexts requiring interdependence across teams and
departments (Thompson, 1967). We theorize, however, that the
interpersonal knowledge network choices that employees make will be
different for individuals who perceive their work as having high versus
low exploration opportunities and for those who perceive their work as
having high versus low exploitation opportunities.1 We also take into
account that in dynamic work environments where the nature of work
changes over time an individual's perceptions of their work can also
change.

#### Means gathering information

[[Exploration refers to the act of gathering information about an
environment]{.underline}]{.mark} as result of being curious \[1\]. The
discrepant properties of objects and events arouse curiosity (e.g., in
the form of a question), and exploratory responses to satisfy this
curiosity expose one to information from the environment that was not
previously available \[5\]. [[By exploring the environment, new
information is acquired and learning ensues]{.underline}]{.mark}. After
a child becomes curious about an exciting new computer game, for
example, her passive exploration might entail merely observing how a
peer plays the game; active exploration would involve actually playing
the game to learn its properties. In effect, active exploration of an
environment is more likely to result in greater knowledge acquisition
than passive exploration \[2\].

[[Geological exploration is the process of finding commercially viable
mineral resource]{.underline}]{.mark} and the objective is to locate it
in the shortest possible time and at the lowest possible cost. The
development of exploration technology over a century is briefed along
with the emerging challenges for the exploration. Exploration approach
design and the myriad activities of exploration cycle are described. The
important ingredients of a successful exploration are (1) selection of
right geological terrain, (2) optimum level of funding, and (3) keeping
pace with the state-of-the-art exploration technology. Adoption of right
combination of techniques is warranted to conduct exploration in a
cost-effective manner. The Quality Control/Quality Assurance validated
exploration data are integrated to generate 3D models for better
interpretation and predictive targeting. Expected net present value and
the risks involved in the discovery of a resource are touched upon. A
combined R&D effort of University, Industry, and Government agencies
will help to achieve the desired result of better success rate in future
exploration efforts.

What, then, is exploration? Exploration is a human activity, undertaken
by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons; it has
components of national interest, scientific research, and technical
innovation but is defined exclusively by none of them.26 [[We define
exploration as]{.mark} an expansion of the realm of human
experience]{.underline}---that is, [[bringing people into new
places]{.underline}]{.mark}, situations, [[and
environments]{.underline}]{.mark}, and expanding and redefining what it
means to be human. Exploration in the context of space activity
addresses a number of key questions, such as: what is the role of the
Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the Earth?
Could it survive without the planet? Human presence, and its attendant
risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large
numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is
in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human
life. [[Exploration by this definition can be accomplished only by
direct human presence]{.underline}]{.mark} and may be deemed worthy of
the risk of human life. "Ships \[of discovery\] must voyage into a moral
universe that explains who a people are and how they should behave, that
criticizes and justifies both the sustaining society and those it
encounters."27

### Exploration K Links

**Exploration is inherently tied up with imperialism and colonization**

**Wills 18,** PhD Dissertation in English Univ of California Riverside
(Kacie, Fancy, Spectacle, and the Materiality of the Romantic
Imagination in Pacific Exploration Culture,
chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://escholarship.org/content/qt3rm3h3q4/qt3rm3h3q4.pdf)

I will be looking at exploration as connected with knowledge, popular
culture, science, fancy, and spectacle. Fulford, Lee, and Kitson
[[define exploration as "a social and political construct bound up with
the history of imperialism,]{.underline}]{.mark}" and as a form of
travel and engagement rather than the discovery of blank spaces (3).
Their approach, as I have pointed out, examines exploration from the
perspective of indigenous people, as well as white men, demonstrating
that exploration is multi-faceted, and, though bound up with this
imperial history, it encompasses a variety of perspectives that are
often overlooked. Jonathan Lamb argues that, within the popular vision
of the history of science, navigation, and empire, there were many
discontinuities that demonstrate that these endeavors did not run
entirely parallel to one another (80). In other words, that the history
of navigation and exploration, while being an integral part of the
colonizing vision, was made up of individuals and relationships that
were, in turn, caught up in a scientific community marked by
heterogeneity, and a public with its own understandings and
interpretations of the South Seas voyages (Lamb 81). [[Acknowledging
that exploration can never be wholly separated from a vision of conquest
and colonization]{.underline}]{.mark} I [[think makes the examination of
alternate perspectives, perspectives of women and indigenous
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, of non-canonical texts and unofficial
narratives, [[all the more important]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is this
approach that I will be taking with my dissertation, as I look to 11
ephemera and the productions of popular culture to find other voices
than the ones captured by history and the science of the period, to find
perspectives that speak to exploration as a heterogeneous and
wide-ranging cultural phenomenon.

## Development

#### Development means to improve or make better

**Brown 7,** Professor Emeritus of Adult and Continuing Education,
University of Glasgow (Lalage, WHAT DO WE MEAN BY DEVELOPMENT? ,
https://www.developmenteducation.ie/media/documents/What.pdf)

Dictionary [[definitions of development include such components as
"evolution]{.underline}]{.mark} or bringing out from a latent or
elementary condition", "growth and [[unfolding"]{.underline}]{.mark},
"[[gradual advancement]{.underline}]{.mark} through progressive stages"
\[Oxford English Dictionary\]. [[To develop is seen as to
"improve]{.underline}]{.mark} or to prosper" \[Collins Thesaurus\].
[[Development is about change]{.underline}]{.mark}, seen as change for
the better, and implicit in all change are concepts of movement and
process. If development is seen as a continuing process, then it follows
that no person or group will reach the end state of being "developed".
It is nowadays seen as a mistake to categorise any nation, for instance,
as 'developed' in distinction from other so-called 'developing'. This
may seem pretty obvious to us, but the notion of dividing the world into
developed and developing is quite strongly embedded in popular discourse
\[eg, among journalists\]. Development is a term used in a number of
fields -- in property matters \[about new building\], in music \[about
the structure of a piece\], in psychology \[about individual people\],
in management \[about training members of a work force\]. For us,
[[development is]{.underline}]{.mark} not about things or works of art
or individual human beings. It is [[about collectivities of
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, communities of all sizes, very often
nations or geographical regions, but also smaller groups. Ideas of
development of communities included \[and at the start were dominated
by\], the perceptions of economists, asking questions about growth and
prosperity. Collectivities of people relate to and influence each other
\[helping or hindering\]. So persons interested in development become
interested in the way development in one society impinges on development
in another. Today we often, therefore, attach the adjective
'international' to the noun 'development', as the UK government did by
renaming its development agency Department for International
Development. This is useful for governments, but we as educators may
also want to remember that there can be interconnectedness between
development \[its character and pace\] in adjoining villages or in towns
and suburbs, or in regions within a nation state \[England and Scotland,
say\] or in wider geographical regions \[Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa,
say\]. We therefore need to make it clear that the subject matter of
development education is not identical with that of international
education, while acknowledging that there are overlaps.
[[Development]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, is about: [[change for the
better]{.underline}]{.mark}; continuing processes; collectivities of
people; growth and prosperity; interrelationships. Further, concepts of
development are applicable all over the world, not just to one sort of
society or selected geographical areas.

#### Development means making socially responsible decisions

**Oberle et al 74**, Professor Department of Agricultural Economies and
Rural Sociology Texas A&M University Wayne H. with., Stowers, K. R., &
Darby, J. P. (1974). A Definition of Development. *Journal of the
Community Development Society*, *5*(1), 61--71.
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00103829.1974.10877525>

The authors assert that a paradox exists: teachers, researchers, and
practitioners recognize the need .for a general theory of development;
yet, many of these individuals perpetuate the need by referring to
"community development" or other types of development without attempting
to explicitly define the concept of development itself. They also assert
that this paradox can be resolved by [[a definition of development which
links]{.mark} the orientations of]{.underline} three
disciplines---[[economics,. sociology, and ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}.
To [[define development as a process in which increasingly more members
of a given area or environment make and implement socially responsible
decisions, the probable consequence of which is an increase in the life
chances of some people]{.mark} without a decrease in the life chances of
others]{.underline}, has two advantages. One is that it aids a focus on
the immediate *and* subsequent effect (s) which behaviour has on the
individual decision-maker *and* on the social structure of which he is a
part. The other is that it provides a basis for an orientation which
encourages the identification of individual behavior and structural
conditions that simultaneously advance the private and public welfare.

#### Development is an evolutionary process of change

**Pillah 23**, PhD Department Of Public Administration, Faculty Of
Management Sciences, Veritas University,, (Tyodzer, Unlocking the
Pillars of Sustainable Development: A Framework for Intergenerational

<http://ijeais.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IJAMSR231117.pdf>)

Development, as a concept, has been associated with diverse meanings,
interpretations and theories from various scholars. [[Development is
defined as 'an evolutionary process in]{.underline}]{.mark} which the
human capacity increases in [[terms of initiating new structures, coping
with problems, adapting to continuous change, and striving purposefully
and creatively to attain new goals]{.underline}]{.mark} (Peet,
Citation1999 cited in Du Pisani, Citation2006). According to Reyes
(Citation2001) development is understood as a social condition within a
nation, in which the needs of its population are satisfied by the
rational and sustainable use of natural resources and systems. Todaro
and Smith (Citation2006) also define development as a multi-dimensional
process that involves major changes in social structures, attitudes, and
institutions, as well as economic growth, reduction of inequality, and
eradication of absolute poverty. Several theories have been put forward
to explain the concept of development. They include the Modernisation,
Dependency, World Systems and Globalisation Theories.

#### Mineral based definitions allow a clean distinction between exploration and development

**Eggert 10**, Professor and Division Director Division of Economics and
Business Colorado School of Mines (Roderick, MINERAL EXPLORATION AND
DEVELOPMENT: RISK AND REWARD ,
https://www.miningnorth.com/\_rsc/site-content/library/education/Mineral_Exploration\_&\_Development_Roderick_Eggert_Eng.pdf)

Mineral exploration and development are the first stage in the process
of mineral supply. The stages of mineral supply are: - Mineral
exploration and development , in which mineral deposits are identified,
evaluated, and prepared for mining. [[Exploration and development can be
subdivided into four substages: (a) grassroots exploration prior
to]{.mark}]{.underline} detection of mineralization or [identification
of a geologic deposit, (b) advanced-stage exploration evaluating a
geologic discovery to determine whether it should 2 proceed to
development, (c) deposit development, in which full technical and
economic assessments are carried out]{.mark}, and a decision is made on
whether to proceed to mining, [[and (d) mine development, in which a
mine and all associated facilities and infrastructure are planned,
designed, and constructed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any precise boundaries
between these substages of exploration and development are somewhat
arbitrary. These substages perhaps most usefully are thought of as a
continuum of activities.

#### Exploration and development refer to distinct satges of resource discovery and production

**Bohl 98**, Attorney with Charles River Associates, (Douglas, CHANGING
PRODUCTIVITY IN U.S. PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT,
https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF-DP-98-38.pdf)

The activities of concern here are oil and natural gas exploration and
development. [[Exploration refers to the activities involved in the
search for hydrocarbon deposits]{.underline}]{.mark}, including initial
geological and geophysical information gathering (e.g., seismic
surveying and reservoir modeling) and drilling to confirm the location
of deposits (e.g., wildcat wells). [Development refers to the activities
involved in preparing a new reservoir for production, including drilling
and completing wells that will be used to extract the deposit]{.mark}.

The official title of the Outer Space Treaty ('OST') mentions both
exploration and use of outer space as the two 'activities of States'
which one has to take into account and which are therefore covered by
the Outer Space Treaty. The same pair of terms appears again in the
Preamble as well as further articles such as Article I and Article III
of the Treaty. Other articles and other space treaties either take up
only one of these two terms or use a general terms such as 'activities
in outer space' (Art. VI, OST) or generally deal with 'objects launched
into outer space' (Art. VII, Art. VIII, OST and the Registration
Convention) or 'space objects' (Liability Convention) or finally
'activities of States on the Moon and other celestial bodies' (Moon
Treaty). At first sight the distinction between exploration and use may
seem sufficiently clear. Indeed in connection with most space activities
there may be little doubt which of these two terms is applicable. First
doubts appear, however, because [[the Outer Space Treaty speaks of
exploration 'of outer space']{.mark}. [This]{.mark} [wording]{.mark}
could be interpreted to [mean that space must be the object of
exploration]{.mark}. The consequence would be that the great part of
[research]{.mark} which has to take place '[in space]{.mark}' in view of
the specific physical conditions there, but [which has as its object
specific materials]{.mark}, [would not be covered and might only be
considered as 'use' of space.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### "In" would be different

#### In is a preposition of place---It means an action that takes place in the Arctic

**Routh 25,** MA in Education and English Content Writer for Quilbot,
(Nicole, Prepositions of Place \| List, Examples & Exercises,
<https://quillbot.com/blog/sentence-and-word-structure/prepositions-of-place/>)

[[A preposition of place]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
"[[in,]{.underline}]{.mark}" "on," or "at") begins a prepositional
phrase that describes a location (e.g., "under the sofa"). The
prepositional phrase [[shows where a noun or action]{.underline}]{.mark}
from another part of the sentence [[is located in relation to the object
of the preposition]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., "The sock was under the
sofa"). The location can be physical (e.g., "in Paris" or "on the
table") or abstract (e.g., "on the radio" or "in the TikTok video").

#### The Choice of "of" vs "in" is an important difference

**9^th^ Circuit Court of Appeals 9 (**Doe 1 v. AOL LLC, 552 F.3d 1077
(9th Cir. 2009).
https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1075638.html)

The district court, without discussion, interpreted the forum selection
clause to refer to state and federal courts of Virginia. We determine
the meaning of the phrase \"courts of Virginia\" de novo, Hunt Wesson
Foods, Inc., 817 F.2d at 77, and look first to its plain meaning. We
have not previously addressed the meaning of a forum selection clause
designating the courts \"of,\" rather than \"in,\" a state. We hold that
the forum selection clause at issue here --- designating the courts of
Virginia --- means the state courts of Virginia 1082\*1082 only; it does
not also refer to federal courts in Virginia.

[[The clause\'s use of]{.mark} the preposition [\"of\"]{.mark} ---
[rather than \"in\" --- is **determinative**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Black\'s Law]{.underline}]{.mark} Dictionary [[defines \"of\" as a
term \"denoting that from which anything proceeds; indicating origin,
source]{.mark}, descent, and the like\....\"\[]{.underline}8\] Black\'s
Law Dictionary 1080 (6th ed.1990). Thus, [[courts \"of\" Virginia refers
to courts]{.mark} proceeding from, [with their origin in,
Virginia]{.mark} --- [i.e.,]{.mark} the [state courts of
Virginia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Federal district courts, in contrast,
proceed from, and find their origin in, the federal
government.\[9\]]{.underline}

[Our interpretation finds support among opinions by our sister
circuits]{.underline} who have addressed the meaning of forum selection
clauses designating the \"courts of\" a state --- all of whom have
interpreted such clauses to refer to the state courts of the designated
state, and not also to the federal courts in the designated state. See
Am. Soda, LLP v. U.S. Filter Wastewater Group, Inc., 428 F.3d 921, 926
(10th Cir. 2005) (interpreting \"Courts of the State of Colorado\" to
mean Colorado state courts; the clause \"refers to sovereignty rather
than geography\"); Dixon v. TSE Int\'l Inc., 330 F.3d 396, 398 (5th
Cir.2003) (interpreting \"Courts of Texas, U.S.A.\" to mean Texas state
courts; \"\[f\]ederal district courts may be in Texas, but they are not
of Texas\"); LFC Lessors, Inc. v. Pac. Sewer Maint. Corp., 739 F.2d 4, 7
(1st Cir.1984) (interpreting forum selection and choice of law clause
stating the contract shall be interpreted according to \"the law, and in
the courts, of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\" to designate the
state courts of Massachusetts; \"the word \`of\' as it appears in the
phrase in question must have been intended to restrict the meaning of
both \`law\' and \`courts\' to those that trace their origin to the
state.\").

Accordingly, we hold the plain meaning of the forum selection clause\'s
designation of the \"courts of Virginia\" is the state courts of
Virginia; it does not include federal district courts located in
Virginia.\[10\]

the former sense here. Presumably, many, if not all, of Allentown State
Hospital\'s other records concerning Dolores L. are just as much its
property as the peer review reports, but there is no doubt that PAMII
was meant to require the hospital to give PP & A access to those
records, as the hospital did. Accordingly, we hold that a peer review
report is a \"record\[\] of . . . an\[\] individual\" under PAMII. 42
U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4). Thus, under this provision, PP & A was entitled to

**Nelson 9** (Dorothy W., Circuit Judge -- Ninth Circuit of the United
States Court of Appeals, "Doe 1, Doe 2, and Kasadore Ramkissoon, on
Behalf of Themselves and All Others Similarly Situated,
Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. AOL LLC, Defendant-Appellee", 552 F.3d 1077;
2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 875, 1-16, Lexis)

OVERVIEW: The ISP made publicly available the internet search records of
more than 650,000 of its members. Under a service agreement, all
customers agreed to a forum selection clause that designated the
\"courts of Virginia\" as the fora for disputes between the ISP and its
customers. The ISP contended, and the district court agreed, that the
clause permitted plaintiffs to refile their consumer class action in
state or federal court in Virginia, but the customers contended the
forum selection clause limited them to Virginia state court, where a
class action remedy was unavailable; this violated California public
policy favoring consumer class actions and rendered the forum selection
clause unenforceable. [The court held that the use of the preposition
\"of\"]{.underline}\--rather than \"in\"\--[was determinative and that
the]{.underline} forum selection [clause referred to]{.underline} the
[state courts]{.underline} of Virginia [only, not]{.underline} the
[federal courts]{.underline} in Virginia. California had declared by
judicial decision the same forum selection clause contravened a strong
public policy of California\--as applied to California residents who
brought claims under California statutory consumer law in California
state court.

#### "Of" is a term of limitation

**Ellis 53** (Judge Advocate -- United States Army, "United States. v.
Private Frank Taylor, Jr.", United States Army Board of Review, 11
C.M.R. 428; 1953 CMR LEXIS 1428, 7-31, Lexis)

Appellate defense counsel argued orally that many facts indicated the
United States was not at war, for example: there has been no declaration
of war; the Coast Guard is still under the supervision of the Treasury
Department instead of the Navy Department as it usually is during war;
here in the United States, Armed Forces personnel are allowed to wear
civilian clothes during off-duty hours; it is not the policy to try
Department of the Army civilians serving with the Army in the field in
the United States by courts-martial; the various Army posts throughout
the United States are still open to public visitation; many reservists
and National Guard units are not on active service; and the Table of
Maximum Punishments had not been suspended for offenses committed in the
United States. He contended that the ratio of the cases cited in support
of the war status of the United States was limited to the locale of the
hostilities, Korea and its adjacent \[\*\*6\]  waters, and was
inoperative on offenses committed in the United States. Finally, he
anchored his argument on the interpretation to be given the language in
Article 43f(1) (post) of the Code. He conceded arguendo that the offense
at bar fell within the purview of this language, being a fraud against a
United States agency, the Army, but reasoned that the subject language
contemplated and embraced only \"hostilities as proclaimed by the
President or by a Joint Resolution of Congress.\" With this
interpretation the board of review cannot agree. [The preposition \"of\"
before the word \"hostilities\" shows plainly that the phrase \"of
hostilities\" is **adjectival**, **qualifying and limiting** the word
\"termination\"]{.underline}. The phrase \"termination of hostilities\"
is in turn modified by the participial phrase \"as proclaimed.\" In our
interpretation it is the \"termination of hostilities\" that must be
proclaimed, and such proclamation provides the initial date of a
three-year period in which the suspension of the statute of limitations
continues to operate rather than determines the date of the beginning of
the original suspension (emphasis supplied).

What is the Arctic? In the strictest sense, the Arctic is all of the
Earth north of the Arctic Circle, located at approximately 66 degrees,
34 minutes North Latitude. However, there are other definitions of the
Arctic that are based on specific scientific or political interest. For
instance, the U.S. Congress has decreed that all of the Bering Sea,
which extends southward to about 53 degrees North Latitude, is part of
the Arctic for internal U.S. planning and budgeting purposes.

### Arctic Circle

Geography from UCLA as well as a Master of Library and Information
Science (MLIS) from SJSU (Caitlin, Arctic Circle,
<https://www.geographyrealm.com/arctic-circle/>)

The Arctic Circle is a line of latitude that separates the Arctic zone
in the north from the Northern Temperate Zone in the south. The Arctic
Circle is the most northerly of the five major lines of latitude.

Where is the Arctic?

Th[[e Arctic is defined as everything north of the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}]{.mark}. The area of the Arctic is about 5.5 million
square miles (14.5 million square kilometers).

Where is the Arctic? [[The Arctic is defined by the Arctic
circle]{.underline}]{.mark} which wraps around the world at 66.5° north
of the equator. It is the northernmost region of the Earth with the
North Pole at its centre. Contrary to what some people mistakenly
believe, the Arctic is not a continent -- there is no land at the North
Pole -- it is a frozen wilderness of sea ice. Worldwide it is estimated
that there is a glacierised area of 726,000 km2 with the Arctic holding
44% of that total1. It is therefore an incredibly important part of the
cryosphere. Eight countries are found within the Arctic circle: the US
(Alaska), Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Canada, Denmark (Greenland)
and Iceland. This zone is called a polar region.

[[The Arctic is often delimited by the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}]{.mark} (66°32\'N) (Figure 2·1), which approximates
the southern boundary of the midnight sun. S[[uch a definition, however,
is simplistic, given variations in temperature, presence of mountain
ranges, distribution of large bodies of water, and differences in
permafrost occurrence.]{.underline}]{.mark} Outlined below are some
definitions of the Arctic region which take into account physical,
geographical and/or ecological characteristics. Following these, the
Arctic region, as defined for the purposes of the AMAP assessment, is
discussed.

### Arctic Council Definition

The Arctic as Defined by the Arctic Council

In addition to the International Maritime Organization definition of the
Arctic, various Arctic Council bodies have established differing
definitions for the Arctic. The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental
forum that promotes the cooperation, coordination and interaction among
the Arctic States, Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic
inhabitants on common Arctic issues. The definitions of the Arctic
developed by various Arctic Council groups vary based on criteria that
are relevant to each body's respective concerns. For example, the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) has established a definition of
the Arctic that incorporates numerous considerations including the
Arctic Circle, political boundaries, vegetation boundaries, permafrost
limits, and major oceanographic features.\[2\] With these criteria in
mind, the Arctic region covered by AMAP includes terrestrial and marine
areas north of the Arctic Circle (66°32'N), and north of 62°N in Asia
and 60°N in North America, modified to include the marine areas north of
the Aleutian chain, Hudson Bay, and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean
including the Labrador Sea.

The Arctic Council's Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response
Working Group (EPPR), the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF)
Working Group, and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP),
all have different definitions of the Arctic as detailed in Figure 2.

### IMO Definition

**HFO Free Arctic 21**, (HBO-Free Arctic is a Campaign led by the Clean
Arctic Alliance.
<https://www.hfofreearctic.org/hrf_faq/what-is-the-arctic/>)

The Arctic is defined differently by various domestic and international
organizations as well as legal agreements. Some common definitions of
the Arctic include (1) the areas above the Arctic Circle (66° 32'N) and
(2) areas delineated by the 10-degree isotherm (a line on a map
connecting points having the same temperature at a given time or the
same mean temperature for a given period). However, both the
International Maritime Organization and the Arctic Council have
different definitions of the Arctic as outlined below: The Arctic as
defined by the International Maritime Organization The International
Maritime Organization defines Arctic waters as "those waters which are
located north of a line extending from latitude 58°00'.0 N, longitude
042°00'.0 W to latitude 64°37'.0 N, longitude 035°27'.0 W and thence by
a rhumb line to latitude 67°03'.9 N, longitude 026°33'.4 W and thence by
a rhumb line to Sørkapp, Jan Mayen and by the southern shore of Jan
Mayen to the Island of Bjørnøya and thence by a great circle line from
the Island of Bjørnøya to Cap Kanin Nos and thence by the northern shore
of the Asian continent eastward to the Bering Strait and thence from the
Bering Strait westward to latitude 60° N as far as Il'pyrskiy and
following the 60th North parallel eastward as far as and including
Etolin Strait and thence by the northern shore of the North American
continent as far south as latitude 60° N and thence eastward along
parallel of latitude 60° N, to longitude 56°37'.1 W and thence to the
latitude 58°00'.0 N, longitude 042°00'.0 W."\[1\]

### Tree Line definition

Characterization Author(s): Nicholas Polunin Source: Journal of Ecology

In the restricted sense to which it seems desirable to limit the term,
the Arctic is thus the region lying to the north-poleward of an
imaginary but by no means meaningless line. Its character is too
impossibly complex and infinitely variable from place to place to define
scientifically, at least in our present state of ignorance: but in
general it may be said to be treeless, with the winters largely dark and
cold and the mean temperature of the warmest month plus one-tenth of the
mean of the coldest month over a cycle of years not more than 90 C.,
with high windchill and less than 50 days between spring and fall
frosts, with the subsoil in most places permanently frozen and
frost-heaving and allied phenomena important, with an annual
precipitation normally below 500 mm. (19-8 in.) and largely in the form
of snow which drifts and is packed tightly by the wind, with the soils
generally moist in summer but the air of low absolute humidity, and with
sheltered salt as well as fresh water frozen over for much of the
winter. But still there are some exceptions of areas which fail to
comply in one or two respects but from general consideration seem for
the time being best included within the arctic region. In the
accompanying circumpolar map I have attempted to indicate (by dots) the
northern limit of coniferous tree growth exclusive of minor outliers, so
covering much of the basis of the first criterion previously mentioned
and also of the second except in some places where arborescent
dicotyledonous growth occurs. I have also indicated the Nordenskiold
line (by long dashes), with some modification in a very few places to
include anomalous areas. The arctic region is then taken as starting
immediately north of which ever of these resultant lines lies the
farthest north on any meridian, this boundary line being smoothed out
(by alternate dots and short dashes) where tongues or outliers suggest
that it should be, or, similarly modified in accordance with other
considerations such as special knowledge of local conditions.

### Precise Definition Is Required

#### Arctic should hava a narrow and precise definition

**Polunin 51,** (Nicholas, The Real Arctic: Suggestions for its
Delimitation, Subdivision and Characterization Author(s): Nicholas
Polunin Source: Journal of Ecology , Dec., 1951, Vol. 39, No. 2 (Dec.,
1951), pp. 308-315 Published by: British Ecological Society Stable URL:
https://www.jstor.org/stable/2257914)

Although in the biological sciences satisfactory definition is often
difficult or even impossible, [[that is no excuse for not attempting to
be-precise. A bad blot in the literature is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
persistent [[vagueness surrounding the use of the term
\'arctic\']{.underline}]{.mark}, whether it be employed in the
adjectival form (in which case it is not now customary to capitalize the
initial letter) or as a substantive implying a region, viz., the Arctic.
It is common for an author to term a plant (or its range) arctic when it
reaches an area which according to his conception (or mere copying)
constitutes part of the Arctic; but what this last is, where it begins
or ends, evidently varies greatly in different authors\' minds. Indeed
the concept has come to be little more than relative, and, consequently,
of limited value at best or, at worst, dangerously misguiding.
Accordingly [[it seems necessary to attempt a
precise]{.underline}]{.mark} (and as far as possible [[concise)
definition or at least delimitation of the Arctic as a
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, variable though it is in character in
different component parts, and to exclude from citation as truly arctic
those entities which are not known to reach it.

### There is no single definition

**Raspotnik 19,** What about the Arctic? The European Union's
Geopolitical Quest for Northern Space By Andreas Raspotnik and Andreas
Østhagen,
https://fni.brage.unit.no/fni-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2623476/2019-ARA-AO-Geoplotics-What-about-the-Arctic.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

But what exactly does the term 'the Arctic' entail? The answer to such a
question is by no means straightforward. In considering 'the Arctic', a
geographical delineation is not enough, with an additional historical or
ideational angle needed in order to truly understand what 'the Arctic'
encapsulates (Archer 2010, 2--3). Despite the Arctic sub-regions varying
greatly in its physical geography, accessibility, climate, population
and related national identity perception -- the many 'Arctics' of the
Arctic -- the area has surfaced as one global region. Ideas emerged of
an area that developed from being considered a natural icy fortification
to a distinct political region, where first and foremost eight
heterogeneous states

and several non-governmental stakeholders jointly deal with a region in
a constant state of flux (Dolata 2015, 3). The Arctic Circle (66°32'N)
is used as the regional delimitation, defining the geographical area
north of it as 'the Arctic'. This area covers the territories of the
Arctic Eight (A8): Canada, Denmark (in relation to Greenland), Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. For some of these
states, their Arctic territories hold a prominent place in both domestic
and foreign policies with national concerns and priorities brought
together in specific Arctic policies/strategies over the last decade
(Bailes and Heininen 2012; Brosnan, Leschine, and Miles 2011)(AuthorA).
In varying degrees, the region plays a role in the national
self-perception of the A8 with a particular understanding of 'our Arctic
only' recently being challenged by a literally opened maritime Arctic
space and increasing regional interests of nonArctic states (AuthorB et
al). In an Arctic setting, sovereignty essentially relates to possession
goals -- land, waters and the resources they contain (Griffiths 2011,
7); 'natural' variables that were allegedly called into question by
increased global interest in the region with some Arctic states having
identified sovereignty problems of Arctic outsiders that essentially
lack such 'natural' Arctic possessions (Aalto 2013, 108; Wegge and Keil
2018, 93--96). Eventually, climate change was not only re-shaping the
physical geographies of the Arctic but essentially also its commercial,
political, and scientific relevance and importance (Wegge and Keil 2018,
88).

## Topic Ballot -- Things the Topic Ballot Says are topical

**NSDAA Ballot 25** Problem Area 1: Arctic,
<https://www.kshsaa.org/Public/Debate/DebateTopic.cfm>

On the affirmative, debaters will have the opportunity to take a deep
dive into different exploration, biodiversity, scientific research, and
trade opportunities. As glaciers melt and shift, there is opportunity
for exploration of the Arctic Ocean and its borders, research of
potential viruses and bacteria that may surface, and an ability to
develop military bases to protect certain areas of the Arctic. The
affirmative can also discuss different plans that can prioritize
Indigenous voices and protections for that land.

## FW---Artic Literacy Important

#### Developing Arctic literacy is vital for students in the U.S.

**Gold et al 21**, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental
Sciences, University of Colorado, Gold, A. U., Pfirman, S., & Scowcroft,
G. A. (2021). The imperative for polar education. Journal of Geoscience
Education, 69(2), 97--99.
<https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2021.1903242>)

Even though polar regions are far away from most of the world's
population, they profoundly impact lower-latitude weather patterns,
raise sea level, and figure prominently in the world\'s economy and
security (National Science Foundation (NSF), Citation2020). The changing
polar environments have created important scientific and societal
concerns, including disruptions to Northern Hemisphere weather, shifting
fisheries, and rising sea levels. Given these far-reaching impacts,
[[understanding polar regions]{.underline}]{.mark}, polar processes and
the connections between climate change at the poles and global climate
[[is important for people across the world. "What happens in polar
regions affects all of us"]{.underline}]{.mark} has been the theme of
the 2020 International Polar Week. [[There is a critical imperative for
polar education to reach]{.underline}]{.mark} education professionals,
[[students of all ages,]{.mark} and the public]{.underline}. The remote
polar regions and extreme conditions under which
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} is conducted [[in the Arctic provide
unique opportunities for capturing the imagination of learners and the
public on topics]{.underline}]{.mark} ranging from science, history,
culture, economics and geography to the arts. At the same time, lack of
accessibility makes it difficult to provide authentic field and at-sea
research experiences for those living outside the polar regions,
allowing only few scientists and many fewer teachers and students from
lower latitudes to participate. Initiatives that connect the Arctic and
Antarctic researchers to learners worldwide, using modern
telecommunication tools, and vetted polar education materials are two
key ingredients for increasing general public polar literacy. For over a
century, the U.S. and countries across the world have invested
significant resources in polar research, illustrated by large
international research campaigns during the four International Polar
Years (IPY) between 1882 and 2008. The U.S. intensified this investment
in polar research, when in 2017 Navigating the New Arctic was announced
as one of the agencies' ten big ideas aiming to improve observations
across the Arctic, the understanding of the Arctic system, and global
impacts. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of
Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition is one example of this renewed
national investment in polar research, which had a major public
engagement component. This year-long expedition (2019-2020) allowed over
500 researchers from over 20 nations to collect observations and
communicate findings on an on-going basis, as their research vessel,
frozen in sea ice, drifted across the Arctic Ocean. While many of the
large research programs have included significant investment in public
outreach and education, such as the 4th IPY (2007--2008), Study of
Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), and MOSAiC, a large proportion of
respondents on national surveys do not consider themselves informed
about polar regions, and [[knowledge about polar
regions]{.underline}]{.mark} has been and [[continues to be limited
among the U.S. population]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hamilton, Citation2016;
Hamilton, Cutter, and Schaefer, Citation2012). For example, the
nationally representative 2016 Polar, Environment, and Science (POLES)
survey showed that less than half of the U.S. public understand the
location of the north and the south poles (Hamilton, Citation2016;
Hamilton et al., Citation2019). Similarly, nationally representative
surveys show that more than half of Americans achieve the equivalent of
a failing grade on a climate knowledge survey (Ballew et al.,
Citation2019; Leiserowitz et al., Citation2010). However, at the same
time, six out of ten Americans indicate that climate change affects
their local community "a great deal" or "to some extent" (Funk &
Kennedy, Citation2019). So, while people are aware of local impacts of a
changing climate, their understanding of the climate system and related
connections to polar regions is limited. [[The lack of broad polar
literacy]{.underline}]{.mark} among the public [[combined with the
importance of the polar regions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the global
climate and socio-economic systems [[highlight the need for
engaging]{.underline}]{.mark} and effective
[[educational]{.mark}]{.underline} materials and [[experiences that
bring polar research and findings to learners in the lower latitudes.
Polar]{.underline}]{.mark} regions and [[topics are largely
absent]{.underline}]{.mark} from educational standards and few teachers
undergo training around polar topics as part of their education. Many
opportunities exist through formal learning in K-16 settings and
improved preparation of teachers, as well as through informal learning
environments, such as museums, parks, planetariums, and nature centers
in which both climate literacy and the understanding of connections
between polar regions and global climate change can be highlighted. A
Polar Literacy initiative, led by Rutgers University, has made progress
in identifying seven Polar Literacy Principles and corresponding topics
to support the work of educators and scientists to increase the public's
understanding of the importance of polar regions (McDonnell et al.,
Citation2020).
