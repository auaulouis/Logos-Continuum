### Example 1NC Colonialism K

#### Ice geographies from the West code the lives that must be sacrificed to keep the world in order -- extraction and capitalist accumulation structure the relationship the West has with the Arctic and you should be skeptical of the 2ACs spin to ever repair that relationship because it will always be cruelly optimistic. 

**Smith '25** Rose Smith is a dAXunhyuu (Eyak, Alaska Native) geographer
interested in the intersections of coloniality, race, and indigeneity as
read through aesthetic and literary contributions, archival evidences,
and experiential embodied knowledges. She received her Ph.D. @ UC
Berkeley in Comparative Ethnic Studies (Jen. Ice geographies: The
colonial politics of race and indigeneity in the Arctic. Duke University
Press, 2025.)//kay kay🧟

Ice geographies might be understood most straightforwardly as mappable
spaces: as territories of the North and South Pole, as the Arctic and
Antarctica. In that sense, these are the spatial, regional areas that I
take up through the chapters of the book. However, this characterization
itself is contested and compromised. As Klaus Dodds and I write
regarding the Arctic, [**Western desires have consistently worked to
render icy locales of the North legible to an audience further
south**.74 In this way, the **cryosphere** is often overwhelmingly
**dissected** and demarcated **not by Indigenous historical and ongoing
claims to space** but instead through nation- state borders]{.underline}
and the documented presence of particular biota as they correlate to
lines of latitude and/or cold temporalities. A circumpolar region of the
Arctic is often defined by lines of latitude such as 66° North,
otherwise known as the Arctic Circle, or the northern limit of the tree
line. Others have adjusted the lines of demarcation used to define the
Arctic depending on sectoral interests such as conservation,
environmental monitoring, shipping, and fishing. There has been
considerable investment in refining these regional categorizations, with
efforts made to distinguish between a high Arctic and a sub- Arctic,
which again use biogeographical objects such as surface vegetation to
tease out a transition zone between very cold and cold environments.
T[here is no one Arctic, in other words.75 Antarctica, while taking a
less central role in this monograph, as is unfortunately a trend across
polar studies, is nonetheless an important site for study of histories
and ongoing forms of coloniality and nationalized science.76 As Jean de
Pomereu and Daniella McCahey write, "Much of what happens in Antarctica
environments, whether natural or human induced, echoes across the Earth
through the effects of glacial melt, the formation of the ozone hole,
variations in the thermohaline circulation and the loss of
biodiversity." 77 In the contemporary moment, "the **Antarctic** is now
as much a **symbol of global anxiety** (with associated rescue
fantasies**), as it is a site of ongoing scientific collaboration and
knowledge exchange**--- snow, **ice**, and the cold are new
**geopolitical and scientific frontlines**."]{.underline} 78 While
Antarctica may be widely understood as the only unpeopled continent on
planet Earth, which makes it distinct from the Arctic, the southern
polar geography is not in any circumstance empty of Human relations or
inequity.79 A history of the Antarctic Treaty alone demonstrates the
claims and desires for access made by various nation-states' scientific
endeavors.80 While Antarctica is overwhelmingly identified as a place
for science, literary production emerges from the southern pole as well.
Men like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edgar Allan Poe, and H. P. Lovecraft,
as well as more contemporary writers, utilize Antarctica as a material
and imaginary locale for storytelling, often using tropes of danger and
lack of human life[. I also mean imaginary in the sense of the
militarized, scientific, and literary imaginaries of ice geographies.
Some might be compelled to separate out scientific information from
literary histories in the production of an imaginary, as well the
military force on which science so often depends, and vice versa. I see
both as constituting narrative imaginings of and about ice. As Dodds and
I have written, there has been no shortage of desire to document the
Arctic's frozen earth and sea ice, ranging from nineteenth- century
Russian surveying of permafrost in eastern Siberia to elaborate
monitoring of drifting sea ice. While these exercises were informed by
scientific laboring, both permafrost and sea ice attracted an array of
other stakeholders, including engineers and industrialists. These
scientific stakeholders were charged with planning Russian and then
Soviet agricultural and industrial development on the one hand. On the
other hand, Soviet and American military planners were desperate to
better understand the sea ice dynamics of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.
Submarine operations during the Cold War depended in large part on
having an up- to- date compendium of data on sea ice distribution and
thickness.81 In these ways, [scientific knowledge production is about
future **speculation** and **imagining worlds** and **how those worlds
might be created in any given spatial context**. It just so happens that
that imagined world-building is often funded by and allied with settler
colonialism, racial capitalism, and property relations--- but this does
not mean that science is not about imagination and producing an
imaginary]{.underline}. In the more explicit sensibility of imaginary, a
literary fascination with the Arctic and Antarctica has been abundant.
Quite simply, as Hester Blum puts it, "Polar exploration produces
writing." 82 A literary obsession with the Arctic is expansive and often
centers an individual protagonist and not a community of characters.
This obsession ranges from the pursuits of Arthur Conan Doyle's "Glamour
of the Arctic" to the wandering monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
From Melville's Moby Dick to Jack London's Buck, from Barry Lopez to
John McPhee--- the Arctic has long acted as setting and protagonist for
(mostly male) writers, especially in the long nineteenth century. As
Heidi Hansson writes, "[The idea of nothingness, pristine nature and
harsh natural conditions has been particularly conducive to adventure
stories and thrillers, as a kind of fictional development of the
narratives of discovery published by Arctic explorers." 83 Increasingly,
Hansson argues, the Arctic has come to function as a transitional space
between the familiar and the alien, as "a threshold that forces the
protagonist to go through a process of estrangement where all signs of
civilization are stripped away in preparation for the encounter with
utopia."]{.underline} 84 In so many ways, both in racialization and
rendering the sublime, ice geographies are coerced to work in
particularly dangerous forms and formations.

#### The 1AC's expansion of exploration and development in the Arctic discursively [trains]{.underline} debaters to view nature as a [resource]{.underline} to benefit national security.

**Harrington and Lecavalier 14**, Assistant Professor of International
Relations @ Durham University (Cameron and Emma, \"The environment and
emancipation in critical security studies: the case of the Canadian
Arctic.\" *Critical Studies on Security*, Vol. 2, No. 1)

[Traditional approaches to security generally focus on protection from
perceived threats **through** the use of **power**]{.underline}. [This
translates to the belief that studies of security should conform to the
'real side of politics;' that is, as policy action in an unchanging
international sphere, where **states** are the **only significant
actors** and their relations are naturalized because they are
structurally pre-determined]{.underline} (Hutchings 1999, 28). As
Sinclair (1996, 6) points out, [traditional theory 'assumes the
functional coherence of existing phenomena', meaning that there is
little interest on the part of analysts and practitioners to excavate
the meanings and assumptions of discourse or practice. Instead, problems
are seen to be emblematic of various deficiencies between
actors]{.underline}, usually [a result of misunderstanding]{.underline},
power disparities, or clashing interests.

Such approaches to environmental security are on vivid display in a
Canadian context, which holds generalizable assumptions about who is to
be secured and from what threats. Evidently, [the referent object is the
state. The environmental threats that are often highlighted and
reinforced in official and academic discourse are varied, containing
both domestic and foreign elements. They include the **struggle** to
**control shipping routes**]{.underline} from a newly opened Northwest
Passage (DFAIT 2013b), the need to **[protect]{.underline}** abundant
**[energy supplies]{.underline}** (Senate of Canada 2012), and the
[potential for environmental activists to block and/or sabotage
government and corporate interests]{.underline} (Public Safety Canada
2011; Payton 2012; Leahy 2013; Freeze 2013). All told, [these
traditional interpretations of environmental security]{.underline} in
Canada display continued traction within both historical and
contemporary official discourse. Crucially, they [rely upon an
understanding of the natural environment that confirms and abides a
homogenous vision of security, whereby the **state** is the **referent
object of protection**]{.underline}, and [the **natural environment
exists to be** managed, controlled, **exploited**, and preserved at the
behest of perceived national interests]{.underline}. The resultant
effects are important for not only a deeper understanding of the ways in
which hazards are judged, but also the ways in which the Welsh School
stands to benefit from incorporating an ecological point of view into
its programme of emancipatory politics.

There is no greater illustration of the intersubjective construction of
Canadian environmental security than in excavating the familiar trope of
Canada as [The Great White North]{.underline}. This [**narrative is
pivotal** in]{.underline} the **[ongoing securitization of the Arctic
region]{.underline}** in Canada. The **[region]{.underline}** has
[persistently been treated as a military object, and as a source of both
pride and vulnerability]{.underline}. It was largely ignored by defence
officials until after the Second World War, when it witnessed a 'variety
of attempts, some relatively minor, others extraordinarily ambitious, to
overcome what was perceived to be an antagonistic environment'
(Lackenbauer and Farish 2007, 923). During the Cold War, Arctic Canada
held important geopolitical significance as a bulwark separating an
expansionary Soviet Union from the North American industrial heartland
(Lackenbauer and Farish 2007, 923). In 1946, Lester B. Pearson, then
Canadian Ambassador to the United States, published an article called
'Canada looks "down north"', in Foreign Affairs, which outlined a vision
of the Canadian north as the strategic heart of the country, and perhaps
even the continent. He proclaimed that

> Canada, like Russia, is looking to the North as a land of the future.
> The reason is obvious. The war and the aeroplane have driven home to
> Canadians the importance of their Northland, in strategy, in
> resources, and in communications. We should no longer be deceived by
> flat maps and 'frigid wasteland' tales of our public school
> geographies. (Pearson 1946, 638)

For Pearson, and for subsequent Canadian governments, [the expansion of
sovereign control over vast swaths of seemingly uncharted, uninhabited
land with abundant resources compelled a heavy emphasis on the ways in
which the **environment** could be harnessed and **utilized** for
national **security**.]{.underline}

John Diefenbakers's election victory in 1958 was largely based on his
northern vision of development. In one of his most oft-cited speeches,
he proclaimed:

> This national Development Policy will create a new sense of National
> Purpose and National Destiny. One Canada! One Canada, wherein
> Canadians will have preserved to them the control of their own
> economic and political destiny. Sir John A. Macdonald gave his life to
> this Party. He opened the West. He saw Canada from East to West. I see
> a new Canada -- a Canada of the North. (Diefenbaker 1958)

Diefenbaker's northern vision, his 'roads to resources' policy, was
instrumental in advancing significant infrastructure projects in the
Arctic. Since then, similar [sentiments about]{.underline} Canada's
destiny to [the Arctic]{.underline} [have retained a high degree of
resonance and power for politicians eager to assert the sovereign
duty]{.underline} of Canadian officials [to discover, accumulate, and
preserve the riches provided by the abundant resource base]{.underline},
lest they be lost to competing interests, or left forever untapped.

In contemporary times, [the onset of climate change, shifting
geopolitical priorities, and continuing energy needs, has re-activated
the security connections with the Arctic.]{.underline} The region is
undergoing a series of significant transformations, which have been
identified by Prime Minister Stephen Harper as a national priority. In
2008, he invoked the spirit of John Diefenbaker in a major policy
address to audiences in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. He proclaimed
that

> Prime Minister Diefenbaker is no longer with us, but the geopolitical
> importance of the Arctic and Canada\'s interests in it have never been
> greater. This is why our government has launched an ambitious Northern
> Agenda based on the timeless responsibility imposed by our national
> anthem, to keep the True North strong and free .... We will protect
> the unique and fragile Arctic ecosystem for the generations yet to
> come. And of course, we will assert and defend Canada\'s sovereignty
> and security in this region. (Harper 2008)

The three central documents detailing Canada's current Arctic policy are
the 2008 Canada First Defence Strategy (National Defence \[Canada\],
2008), the 2009 Northern Strategy (Indian and Northern Affairs
\[Canada\]), and the 2010 document, Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy
(DFAIT 2010). Together the three documents represent an aggressive
expression of national sovereignty and security in the far North. The
Arctic Foreign Policy proclaims 'the first and most important pillar
towards recognizing the potential of Canada's Arctic is the exercise of
our sovereignty over the far north' (DFAIT 2010, 5). Indeed, Prime
Minister Harper declared the protection and promotion of Canadian
sovereignty over the Arctic 'a non-negotiable priority' (CBC News 2010).
All three documents illustrate the government's priorities of
'exercising sovereignty; promoting economic and social development;
protecting \[our\] environmental heritage; and improving and devolving
Northern governance' (Indian and Northern Affairs \[Canada\] 2009).
[These priorities have been reinforced by ongoing security manoeuvres
that increase state control over the farthest reaches of its territory.
In the form of material expression, security is being claimed via the
utilization of military ice-breakers; patrol ships; the creation of a
new deep water port in Nanisivik, Nunavut (Harper 2007a); the deployment
of military personnel including the Northern Rangers (Lackenbauer
2004--2005); and the undertaking of joint military operations with other
Arctic countries under Operation Cold Response and Operation Nanook. As
Wilfrid Greaves writes, 'Canada's approach to Arctic security remains
preoccupied with traditional, state-centric military threats, despite
the fact that all three documents explicitly specify that **no** such
military **threats exist'**]{.underline} (Greaves 2011, 230).

Adding complexity is the fact that, in May 2013, Canada assumed the
two-year Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, the leading
intergovernmental body of Arctic nations. The government's highlighted
priorities include 'responsible resource development', 'safe Arctic
shipping', 'sustainable circumpolar communities', and 'strengthening the
Arctic Council' (DFAIT, 2013a). These priorities have been identified as
part of a larger strategy to maintain northern control in the face of
growing competition for oil and mineral wealth located in the Arctic.
The Chairwoman of the Council, Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq
proclaimed, 'We must remember that the Arctic Council was formed by
Northerners, for Northerners, long before the region was of interest to
the rest of the world' (quoted in Koring 2013).

Effectively, [the results are that traditional **interpretations of
security** are being **transposed** onto the **physical geography of the
Arctic** region]{.underline} through official Canadian discourse[. In
other words, something labelled 'security' is being written on the body
of the Earth via discursive and material practices. Recent announcements
by Harper have described government investments in the region as
necessary for unlocking the north's 'potential' and the 'national
destiny']{.underline} (Harper 2009), for discovering buried resource
'treasures' (Harper 2007a), and for managing the vast, seemingly endless
'frontier' (Harper 2012). 3 The result is that the state has been able
to assert traditional means of control over the natural environment of
the far north. Concurrently, the natural environment conditions Canadian
security. [Official discourse has frequently incorporated the region's
'remoteness' into a vision of security where **physical enemies** and
**logical uncertainties** are forever **lurking** and where
**unfulfilled opportunities abound**]{.underline}. Both the environment
and Canadian security itself becomes constructed by mantras of sovereign
control, ownership, and exclusion, which in the face of rapidly
increasing climate change and resultant environmental changes, provides
ample contradiction. Harper proclaimed in 2007 that:

> Canada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty over
> the arctic. We either use it or lose it. And make no mistake, this
> Government intends to use it. Because Canada's Arctic is central to
> our national identity as a northern nation. It is part of our history.
> And it represents the tremendous potential of our future. (Harper
> 2007b)

Such statements are reflective of the powerful effects that the
environment holds in traditional security discourse. Government speeches
offer lessons on the ways in which interpretations of the vastness of
geography, the spectre of resource abundance, and the preoccupation with
control over nature can stimulate security logics. Lawrence Cannon, then
minister of foreign affairs, proclaimed to a UK audience in 2010 that
Canada was an 'Arctic Nation', an 'Arctic power', and that the 'Arctic
and the North are part of our national identity' (Cannon 2010). Such
rhetoric effectively demonstrates 'the ways in which "The North" is
imagined as a space of national pride, belonging, and exploration: a
space that is alternately normalized as a fundamental extension of state
territory and exoticized as a distant wilderness to be conquered'
(Steinberg 2010, 81).

Visions of the environment continue to be deeply implicated in the
writing of Canadian identity and in the operation of Canadian politics.
The idea of The Great White North defines the nation's security
interests -- who is to be secured, what way of life protected. The
invocation of [The Great White North denotes the natural environment as
an important source of economic value and a salient frame for
conceptualizing international geopolitics.]{.underline}

#### That conditions Native silencing, exacerbates climate change, and trades off with the environment's intrinsic value

**Harrington and Lecavalier 14**, Assistant Professor of International
Relations @ Durham University (Cameron and Emma, \"The environment and
emancipation in critical security studies: the case of the Canadian
Arctic.\" *Critical Studies on Security*, Vol. 2, No. 1)

By providing a critical reading of the national security vocabulary,
this section challenges [the naturalization of Canadian Arctic security
as The Great White North, highlighting the discourse\'s pernicious
implications and drawing attention to the peoples and narratives omitted
from its gaze. The approach to the Canadian north described in the
previous section has two important consequences: first, the
**exploitative** and **instrumental thinking** engendered by The Great
White North discourse **creates** new **vulnerabilities** for Canadian
**indigenous peoples**. Second, this **marginalization** is implicated
in the **silencing** of **alternative security discourses** emanating
from the Arctic like, for instance, Canadian Inuit peoples.]{.underline}
[The Great White North discourse effectively writes out the 1,172,790
First Nations]{.underline}, Inuit and Métis [peoples]{.underline} of
Canada (Statistics Canada 2006). By focusing on a subset of voices
within this population -- the Inuit peoples of Inuit Nunaat, stretching
from northern Laborador to the Northwest territories -- this section
seeks to outline an alternative Canadian Arctic security. Focusing on
the challenges of climate change and resource extraction, the discussion
below seeks to highlight how the processes driving these changes are at
odds with the understandings of nature among Inuit peoples and how Inuit
peoples are struggling to make their particular logic intelligible
within the wider Canadian context. In other words, they are striving to
make their particular experiences of environmental insecurity
understood.

According to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA), climate change
will acutely affect the Canadian Arctic, with annual mean warming
projected to range between 3°C and 9°C in winter months (ACIA 2005).
[The myriad consequences of warming in the Arctic are all too familiar:
rising sea levels, a multiplication of insect activity, and increased
vulnerability to air-, water-, and vector-borne diseases]{.underline}
(Furgal and Seguin 2006). These [hazards will be compounded by
additional changes in Inuit livelihood. Thinning sea ice in the winter
months may jeopardize forms of winter travel and limit access to
wildlife resources]{.underline} (Furgal and Seguin 2006). Moreover, [the
migratory patterns of food sources like caribou and geese may change.
For the many Inuit peoples who engage in subsistence activities, these
changes are likely to mean increased food insecurity, and may force
these communities to seek inappropriate food substitutions or expensive
alternatives: both options may put Inuit peoples\' **cultural live** at
risk]{.underline} (Wenzel 2009). As one report argues, 'the
contamination of country food (traditional food sources) raises problems
that transcend the usual confines of public health, and that cannot be
resolved simply by health advisors or food substitutions' (Van Oostdam
et al. 1999, 7). Inuit food defines the Inuit way of life and mode of
being (Egede 1995). Practices such as hunting and fishing are not merely
instrumental nutritional practices, but are also culturally important
traditions to Inuit peoples as sources of 'pride, worth,
distinctiveness, and identity' (Buell 2006, 26). [If identity is a
fundamental component of envisioning security -- that is, who or what is
to be secured -- it is clear that Inuit peoples\' food insecurity
portends a greater cultural and even **existential threat**]{.underline}
(Campbell 1992).

In addition to the challenges created by the spectre of climatic change,
[the **extraction** of **non-renewable** resource**s** in the Arctic
adds to the **fragility** of the social landscape in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Resource extraction increases fears of oil spills
and contamination, the loss of sacred spaces for hunting, trapping and
fishing, and disrupts traditional migratory routes of species such as
birds and caribou (Buell 2006). For many Inuit communities, the
[resource extraction industries as they currently operate are at odds
with their cultural practices of sustainable and respectful use of the
environment]{.underline} (NAHO 2008). At the Third Session of the United
Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2004, the representative
from the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) argued that thus far,
development projects have failed to take into account indigenous
priorities, but that this conflict was not necessarily predetermined:
the ICC representative further noted that 'Development projects could
either help indigenous peoples survive, or destroy them and their
cultural heritage, depending on how they are managed' (United Nations
2004). In other words, a [more **harmonious way** of **conceptualizing
development** that does not come at the expense of indigenous
livelihoods is sought]{.underline}. Such [conceptualizations are
emblematic of **indigenous security alternatives**]{.underline} that
challenge The Great White North security discourse.

Inuit leaders and members of the Inuit Circumpolar Council have
demonstrated security alternatives with emancipatory potential. It is
useful to examine these alternatives because they may provide critical
security scholars with a deeper appreciation of the role of the
environment in security and can offer a venue for more constructive
thinking about emancipation. In contrast to The Great White North
narrative demonstrated in the previous section, [the discourse of the
ICC analysed below demonstrates a belief that the natural world is
intrinsically rather than instrumentally important. This suggests a
broader and more profound idea that the **environment** is as much a
**source of identity** as it is **security**]{.underline}. It also
demonstrates that the environment is [not exogenous to]{.underline}
indigenous **[life]{.underline}**, but is rather a condition of
possibility for Canadian indigenous identity. It thus reflects many of
the assumptions of critical security by collapsing the idea of the
security subject as an abstract, detached actor, divorced from the wider
social and natural environments.

#### The alternative is a reading of the aff through [Alterlife]{.underline} -- a praxis grounded in [rejecting the Western frameworks]{.underline} constitutive of the affirmative and embracing the knowledge created by Indigenous people in the 'Arctic Wasteland'

softly)."]{.underline}** 14 [Each of us is implicated with ice melt.
Though, like the metabolization of chemicals, there is an unequal felt

this alterlife, in which we are all caught up in the differently
experienced melt, the generative capacity of emptiness can act as a
reframing. I will not rush to narratively fill emptiness, to beautify it
toward progress.]{.underline} **[Erica Violet Lee writes, "A wasteland
is a place where, we are taught, there is nothing and no one is

devastation."]{.underline}** [17 I add that wastelands are named
wastelands by the ones who have no relation, no history to lands deemed
empty, wasted, and/or destroyed. I'm unconvinced by the need to prove
otherwise, to fill emptiness. In looking closely at a snowflake, the
building material of ice, each snow crystal is shaped by its corners,
openings, bubbles, and empty spaces. **These characteristics are what
fundamentally constitute the productive and capacious nature of ice,

every knowable thing in every knowable aspect about our research
subject, object, place, and interlocutors, to name and intellectualize a
feeling into data before we've let it wash over and saturate
us**]{.underline}. [**In emptiness there is pause. There is no
requirement for full, complete interpretation or translation. In
emptiness, critical co-theorizing, productive touching, and
contamination among us can occur without a final answer,** magnifying
glass, dictation, a recording device, a funded grant, a performance of
complete mastery. In emptiness, there is also what I offer as careful
guessing or careful guesswork.]{.underline} **[Building from critical
Indigenous studies, guesswork honors emptiness, respecting the refusals,

new theories that displace Indigenous theorizing.]{.underline}**19

impossible.]{.underline} [Who and what shape my questions that seem

best of my knowledge, with accountability to place and peoples,20 and
with an ethic of anti- coloniality and decoloniality when
possible.]{.underline}21 **[Careful guesswork insists that objectivity
is an impossibility, that researchers are narrators who craft

## FRAMEWORK

### DA\-\--Scenario Planning

#### Scenario planning over the Arctic creates [spectator politics]{.underline} that entrench colonial dynamics and justify indigenous non-sovereignty

**Dodds** and Smith **23**, Professor of Geopolitics, University of
London (Klaus, and Jen Rose. \"Against decline? The geographies and
temporalities of the Arctic cryosphere.\" The Geographical Journal 189.3
(2023): 388-397. Accessed: 6/17/25)

As scholars of the Arctic have noted, a [dominant discursive formation
which continues to frame the Arctic as a circumpolar region is one
characterised by reference to cold climate and frozen
environment]{.underline} (for example, Bloom, 1993; Grace, 2000). For
the last 15 years, there has been a steady production of
**[articles]{.underline}**, books, documentaries and films [purporting
to track]{.underline} and trace **[transformations of the changing
Arctic]{.underline}**. There has been a relentless quest to identify a
'New Arctic', which is characterised by excessive change to ice, ocean
and air (for instance, Evengård et al., 2015). Physical change is [held
responsible for stimulating more extraction, more mobility and more
governance. What gets lost in these sweeping overviews are **two
fundamental things**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**, as Ruiz et
al. (2019) note, is ['Making sense of ice \[and we would add land,
ocean, air\] is not just a material question, but involves **ideas
rooted across** past, present, and future **socio-cultural contexts**
and environmental experiences']{.underline} (Ruiz et al., 2019, p. 8).
[The role of ice in the human history of the Arctic varies in meaning
and significance; so making sense of loss will itself reveal different
ontologies and epistemologies]{.underline} (Gearheard et al., 2013).
Second, [the power of story-telling remains profoundly
asymmetric]{.underline}. Recent **[calls for research]{.underline}**
into the 'Arctic Anthropocene' [reveal yet again a fondness for
**thinking** of the polar regions as '**lab**oratorie**s**' for
**non-polar audiences** to **extract**, **observe** and process **from
afar**]{.underline} (for example, Finger, 2016). [Indigenous and
northern communities have been telling their own stories for millennia
but still have to fight to be heard in a region that so often has been
framed by outsiders as a blank, people-less void]{.underline}.

As volumetric ice became 'quantifiable data' it encouraged conversation
across disciplines such as climatology and oceanography (Elzinga, 2017).
[Ice core research became less about the localised extraction of ice
from ice sheets and instead was rendered data to be interpreted as
global climate information and **planetary story-telling**]{.underline}.
Thus, [climate modelling]{.underline} in the 1960s and 1970s [made the
Arctic 'global' and trans-national]{.underline} far before the term was
being used as a shorthand to describe the growing interest from Asian
countries in Arctic geopolitics and governance (Sorlin & Lajus, 2014;
Woon & Dodds, 2020). The cryosphere became in short 'portable', in ways
that earlier maps and forms of aesthetic media had previously provided,
such as through early photographs, paintings and drawings of glaciers
and icefields by early colonial explorers, travellers and tourists to
northern spaces. [While ice had been considered portable, even pocket
size through a photograph or drawing, the technology of ice coring and
the infrastructure built to keep ice cores frozen created a new terrain
of the volumetric space of ice and the data it contains]{.underline}
(Antonello & Carey, 2017). [Ice data became part and parcel of
computerised climate modelling, intra-proxy environmental
research]{.underline} (for example, pollen, tree rings), and
geo-chronological analyses of human and non-human climate forcing
(Cosgrove, 2008; Achermann, 2020).

In addition to the ice core, [there has been no shortage of endeavors to
document the Arctic\'s frozen earth and sea ice]{.underline}, ranging
from nineteenth century Russian surveying of permafrost in eastern
Siberia to elaborate monitoring of drifting sea ice during the
International Geophysical Year (1957--8). While these exercises were
informed by scientific labouring, both permafrost and sea ice attracted
an array of other stakeholders, including engineers and industrialists
(Brunn, 2020). These [scientific stakeholders were charged with planning
Russian and then Soviet agricultural and industrial development on the
one hand]{.underline}. On the other hand, [Soviet and American military
planners were desperate to better understand the sea ice dynamics of the
Arctic Ocean. Submarine operations during the Cold War depended in large
part on having an up-to-date compendium of data on sea ice distribution
and thickness]{.underline} (Roberts, 2015). One main [intent of such
mapping projects was to create knowledge sets about ice as a dynamic,
transitional materiality that could either help or hinder movements of
military and capital, **buoying** or **tanking** **colonial
nation-state** financial **interests**]{.underline}. [What links
nineteenth century Russian exploration of eastern Siberia and
mid-twentieth century sea ice mapping is a sense that the Arctic\'s cold
qualities were sufficiently enduring to necessitate academic, financial
and infrastructural investigation and investment]{.underline} (Herzberg
et al., 2018). [Such was the scale and extent of frozen ground in Russia
and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean that the Arctic could be routinely
**framed** as a **place of frustration** due to the unruliness of ice in
**complicating** Euro-Western **exploration**, exploitation,
**industrial development** and trade, as well as acting as a buffer and
at times barrier to the shrinking of space--time as movements of capital
are enacted]{.underline} (Chu, 2020).

As [research connects the global cryosphere to debates about the
Anthropocene, the affordances provided by Arctic and Antarctic ice
became increasingly recognised and celebrated as integral to seasonal
regularity, shaping the wider benefit to the earth\'s (human)
inhabitants that have come to depend upon it since the Little Ice
Age]{.underline}. As scholars of ice have noted, the last 150 years have
been extraordinarily dependent on relationships and entanglements with
artificial and natural frozen water (Dodds, 2018; Heidbrink, 2020). In
the nineteenth century a global ice trade flourished involving the
extraction and transportation of Arctic glacial, river and lake ice that
connected, for example, Alaska to California and Norway to the United
Kingdom. T[hese global movements also demonstrate the role of ice in
fulfilling the need of certain racialised bodies to 'keep cool' in
tropical geographies, which signals and shapes oppressive interfaces
between colonial actors and Indigenous peoples, between the metropole
and the colony (Hobart, 2022). In this way, ice can act as both a
deterrent to movements of empire and colonialism in the Arctic and
Antarctic while also demonstrating aesthetics of colonial comfort of ice
as a comestible transported from the hinterlands. If tropical heat is
disorienting, and ice a mediating factor in providing stability and
comfort for temperate bodies and agents of colonialism, here ice can be
understood as a buffer]{.underline}, something that George Orwell
reflected upon in his ruminations about life in colonial Burma, entitled
Burmese Days (Orwell, 1934).

In the twentieth century, [scientific interest in the Arctic, especially
the island of Greenland, grew markedly as climate research began to
shift its attention away from natural variability towards the
perturbative role of human agency. The Arctic proved itself to be
strategically significant to colonial-capitalist militaristic endeavours
and initiatives during World War II and the appropriately named Cold
War. What connects the three developments is the role and value of ice:
as commodity, as locatable and portable scientific object, as substance
that challenged conventional military tactics and domain
awareness]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [civil-military resourcing could
also **enable** the material **presence** of scientific stations
dedicated to ice coring and ice surveying in the Arctic and Antarctic.
Domain awareness was not restricted to land, sea and air. Going
'underground' had its advantages; scientists were eager to discover more
about what lay underneath ice sheets and glaciers while militaries
experimented with plans to hide infrastructure including missile
installations under those same ice bodies]{.underline}. The [toxic
remains of such military projects and plans are easily found across
Arctic spaces. As the ice harvester, the scientist and the soldier/naval
officer quickly discovered what Indigenous people have already long
known and experienced, ice is highly dynamic, shape-shifting and capable
of frustrating, blocking and resisting human designs. As Michael Bravo
has alerted us, there is a cryo-politics to all of this]{.underline}
(Bravo, 2017).

In this moment of late modernity, however, [the Arctic now comes to
matter differently on the main stage and through the main stream. Now,
scholars, scientists, activists and journalists report that there is too
little ice, too much glacial retreat, and insufficient frozen
terrain]{.underline} (Balog, 2012). Ice is no longer performing as a
reliable buffer---containing subsurface carbon stores, reflecting heat,
and preserving the frigidity of polar waters. Nor is ice performing as a
constant or consistent barrier. [Whereas earlier dominant refrains
regarding the Arctic discussed it as an obstacle, if anything useful to
comment upon at all, now Arctic ice as it drastically transforms shape
and viscosity receives more press than ever. If the Arctic was largely
ignored and overlooked in previous eras of the Western master narrative,
in dominant discourse now, the **Arctic** in part **constitutes** what
it means to be a **human** being in a moment of **late**-stage
**capitalism**]{.underline}. As Morehouse and Cigliano (2020) report,
[glacial funerals are now being held in Iceland as a way of marking
disappearance and persistent sea ice loss is credited as ushering into
existence a 'new Arctic']{.underline} (on the 'new Arctic', see Serreze,
2018). Morehouse and Cigliano (2020) suggest that the [public mourning
of glacial disappearance operates as an opportunity to think of ice as
animate rather than inanimate]{.underline}, an idea similar to
Cruickshank\'s detailing of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Eyak philosophies
pertaining to **[glacial sentience]{.underline}**, and the long held
belief that **[glaciers are social actors that change physical, social
and spiritual landscapes]{.underline}**. This is a loss that cannot be
adequately captured by metrics such as ice melt and surface area
exposure but something that speaks to the connections between ice and
the life-worlds of others. In her account of life on either side of the
Bering Strait, Bathsheba Demuth reminds us of how sea ice is lively,
animate and life-affirming. As she notes:

> In forming, thawing and shifting under the wind, ice steadies the
> circulation of the world\'s oceans, making them hospitable for living
> things ... The sea ice shapes being, human and otherwise, on this
> planet. From its groaning surface, the world as we know it is made
> (Demuth, 2019, pp. 21 --36)

Here Demuth\'s attunement to the necessity of ice is understood as
relational, symbiotic and mutualistic in its crucial functioning. It
works, in sympathy, with the other accounts that consider Indigenous
life-worlds and the meaning of ice in shaping the lives of the peoples
of the Arctic (Gearheard et al., 2013).

Simultaneously to Demuth\'s descriptions, [the Arctic\'s liquefying
materiality presents a series of perceived dangers that create an Arctic
of alarmistic discourse: soon the Arctic Ocean will be open water,
glaciers will disappear, and a warming Arctic will result in a methane
bomb radiating ill-effects around the Earth\'s climate. In these
alarmist renderings of a melting North, a hidden and **invisible enemy**
lurks **within the ice** and its subsurface in the permafrost as stored
carbon]{.underline}. In its newly appreciated animacy by some,
**[ice]{.underline}** [becomes a]{.underline} **[villain]{.underline}**
[that melts and releases new forms of planetary havoc (]{.underline}with
perhaps earlier echoes of Soviet framings of permafrost as villainous
even mischievous, see Chu, 2020). In the last decade and a half, popular
writers and academics have warned about the geophysical transformation
of the Arctic and its likely implications for commerce, governance,
human security and even for an 'inhabitable climate' (for example,
Wallace-Wells, 2019). [The direction of intellectual traffic favouring a
medley of conflictual and co-operative scenarios for the future Arctic,
with a great deal of energy devoted to present and likely future
intentions of Arctic and non-Arctic states. The focus on ice-free lanes
of traffic open a Northeast/ Northwest passage that was once only fabled
and longer-term a trans-polar route]{.underline}, slicing through the
centre of the Arctic Ocean.

[In the midst of all this auditing and speculation by colonial
nation-states, Indigenous Arctic polities, especially those in smaller,
coastal communities in Alaska, are consistently overlooked yet
simultaneously placed with the burden of carbon consequence. The most
recent of which manifesting as enforced relocation via sea level
rise---a relocation not sponsored by the nation-states that carry most
participatory responsibility for the drastic change in sea levels. For
the large part, Indigenous communities of the Arctic are interpreted as
hyper vulnerablised due to effects of disappearing sea ice, as
noteworthy exemplars of resilience in relation to adjusting to a new ice
reality, and/or a (potentially) renewable resource of traditional
ecological knowledge that will assuage climate collapse for a white,
temperate world]{.underline} (Smith, 2021). **[Less often]{.underline}**
are [**Indigenous communities understood as sovereign polities with
legal, historical and spiritual claims** to land, water, air and ice.
Furthermore, rarely are Indigenous communities included as major
stakeholders in international and cross-organisational reports done in
regards to the Arctic]{.underline}. What makes volumes such as The
Meaning of Ice notable, however, is their explicit focus on the meaning
that Indigenous communities give to sea ice; as a facilitator of
mobility; as provider of food and supplies used in the acts of daily
life; as intimately connected to a sense of home; and as a source of
well-being and ontological security (Gearheard et al., 2013; Aporta et
al., 2014).

### Arctic Expansionism\-\--1NC

#### The Arctic is a construct to justify frontier expansion

**Keskitalo 9**, Professor of Political Science @ Umeå University,
Sweden. (E. Carina H. \""The North"--Is There Such a Thing?\" in *Cold
Matters*, ed. by Heidi Hansson and Catherine Norberg, (2009): 23.)

[However]{.underline}, today, [when looking for an answer to the
questions "What is the North? and What is the Arctic?" one is
immediately drawn to Canadian views, which seem to continue the ideology
of exploration and have been much criticised for this. While many
countries may apply an Arctic imagination as described above, Canada is
one of the few countries that clearly do so internally -- for areas
within its own state, rather than for a "far North."]{.underline} In
Canada, the **[term]{.underline}**s "**[Arctic]{.underline}**" and
"North" are **[regularly used]{.underline}** interchangeably and
generally refer to the same area, the administratively **[delineated
territories]{.underline}** above 60° north latitude -- a geographical
definition developed in the age of exploration, drawing upon the mirror
delineation of the Antarctic at 60° south (Shields 1991). The view of
this [internal Arctic, however, largely echoes views
elsewhere]{.underline}. The Canadian view of the North has been seen as
a way of **[describing]{.underline}** the **[North]{.underline}** to
southern Canadians as an indigenous "wilderness [zone of
purity]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} simultaneously as an area
"**[offering riches to developers]{.underline}**" from the outside
(Shields 1991: 181). The Canadian construction has been criticised by
many authors, such as Rob Shields and Ken Coates, who emphasise that the
space-myth of the "True North Strong and Free"--- words that appear in
the Canadian national anthem, reminiscent of one of Tennyson's poems
referring to Canada -- [places "the Arctic" in a specific role of
wilderness]{.underline}. Through this myth, "\[s\]outherners
**[construe]{.underline}** the **[North]{.underline}** as a
**[counter-balance]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[civilised]{.underline}** world of the [South]{.underline}ern cities
yet as the core of their own, personal Canadian identity" (cf. Coates
1991 Shields 1994: 163; ). Developed in this way, Shields argues that
the myth of the Canadian Arctic as the "True North Strong and Free"
forms "a mythology which is first of all practiced, and only second
consciously contemplated" (Shields 1994: 199).

In accordance with this view, Janice Cavell points out that "\[[i\]t has
become almost traditional to begin any discussion of the role played by
the North in the Canadian national consciousness with the suggestion
that Canadians 'have always been fascinated by the Arctic'"]{.underline}
(Cavell 2002: para. 1). Perhaps similar to the reasons for which the
British empire emphasised the Arctic, authors have argued that the
[notions of "the Arctic" or "the North" have been made integral in
Canadian economic, social and psychological development and have been
invoked internationally as well as domestically, and as a consequence
according Canada a national identity and a place in the
world]{.underline} (Nord 1991). **[Canada's]{.underline}** striving for
a **[self-]{.underline}**definition in relation to its southern
neighbour (the USA) [and a wish to deal with the "blank space on the
map" have contributed to this development]{.underline}. 1

Such a view can be seen as based on the idea of the
**[Arctic]{.underline}** as a '**[frontier']{.underline}** (Coates 1991)
--- again, [a particularly North American application, where Canada is
perhaps the main example with regard to the North (even if the concept
may have some application to Russia's wide Northern spaces). The concept
of the frontier has been described as "the central myth-ideological
trope of American culture"]{.underline} (Slotkin 1985: xx, quoted in
King 2000: 16) [and can be seen to have played a significant role in the
formation of Arctic categories. Subsequently, it has also been one of
the most contested ideas. The epitomal work in describing a frontier
perspective is that of Frederic Jackson Turner who used the frontier
concept to explain the development of the US and the American national
mentality and identity up through 1880.]{.underline} Turner's work,
originally published in 1893, sees the [frontier as existing at the
meeting of what is perceived as "wilderness," that is, areas of pure
natural environment that are only inhabited by indigenous peoples living
in traditional ways, and what is perceived as "civilisation," that is,
the **culture** of the **colonisers**]{.underline} (Turner 1976). In
[Canada, the role of the Arctic as a frontier was naturalised through
the state's development at the time when the frontier concept was most
prominent]{.underline} (Canada was established as a federal state in
1867). Historically, and with effects reaching into the present day,
[the frontier myth resulted in a separation of "wilderness" and "city,"
and the creation of specific roles for the populations of such
"wildernesses": as indigenous peoples, they were viewed as different and
were conceived of in terms of their relation to the environment. As the
wilderness was not a place 29 for non-indigenous everyday life until it
had lost its frontier role, the conception of wilderness also invited
boom-and-bust cycles where the "natural abundance" of the wilderness was
harvested]{.underline} (King 2000: 29). In this way, "the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**" became the wild lands across which progress
took place. It was [described in terms of]{.underline} an
**[outside]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** an
**[inside]{.underline}**, that is, as a unit, but one **[without a
cultural agency]{.underline}**.

the national budget as the method to intervene, these legislators

have been protesting and organizing on this issue for months, even
facing arrest (Bensonisen 2024]{.underline}**).[3What is remarkable
about the Socialist Left party's work to stop deep sea mining is how
none of these legislators were Sami, and many of them were not even from
the Arctic ("The People in SV ," 2024).]{.underline} As I conclude my
paper with the point of how the Arctic is a point of critical
environmental injustice due to its function as a boon to state power,

contemporary example of how everyone, even settlers, can band together

global experience.]{.underline}** **[When information is discovered in
the ice core, a human identity is created and meant to be shared among
us. Here, a "we" is shaped who occupies a planet in a moment of modern
climate crisis. In these headlines, however, pushback is present from
Māori researchers who see one use of applied ice core study as a kind of
"helicopter science" that does not engage rigorously with Indigenous
peoples or their histories of land use]{.underline}**. [Scholars have
criticized the utilization of ice core science toward universalizing
narrations that overlook the entangled nature of matter, science, and
story, especially when made toward a planetary and chronological project
that excludes difference of multiple kinds]{.underline}.26 [Critical
scholars describe the ice core as an epistemic object that emerges
through a linear, narrative reasoning wherein an imagined and pending
apocalypse can only be stalled by heroic intervention.]{.underline}27
Sverker Sörlin and ErikIsberg categorize **[the ice core as an
environmental object that eclipses a localized study of glaciology from
whence it emerged]{.underline}**. **[It now operates within a
geo-anthropological temporality that shapes Earth system science toward
a problematic planetary knowledge regime]{.underline}**.28 Alessandro
Antonello and Mark Carey assess **[ice core stories as reinforcing a
chronological time that is too neatly separated into "Earth time,"
"Human time," and "Future time." This temporal separation extracts ice
from Indigenous lands]{.underline}** [of Kalaallit Nuunat (Greenland)
and the data from which focus unevenly on the industrialized West,
Europeans, North Americans, and North Atlantic peoples.]{.underline}29
**[While the temporal dimensions of ice core science have been a central
arena for critique, so has the imbrication of ice core study with
militarism and nationalized science.]{.underline}** Yusoff describes
**[ice cores as spaciotemporal envelopes that archive global
atmospheres, which are caught up in a geopolitical infrastructure of
public activism, nationalized science, and militarism]{.underline}**.30
In a similar vein, Jessica O'Reilly characterizes **[Antarctic ice core
stations as facilitating and necessitating a kind of paramilitary
atmosphere]{.underline}**.[31 In Antarctica alone, she writes, "there
are sixty- eight national research stations . . . run by thirty states"
that are supported by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 that includes
territorial claims of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia,
Argentina, Norway, France, and Chile.32 In Kalaallit Nuunat, Johanne M.
Bruun writes that "the natural sciences were enmeshed with questions of
sovereignty, territory, and national security as science was seen as the
key to defeating the antagonistic Arctic environment and to protect the
American homeland."]{.underline} 33 **[Ice cores are taken and stored in
laboratories in and on behalf of US nationalized science, often far from
Indigenous homelands from whence they were extracted.3]{.underline}**4
**[These "portable cryospheres" 35 are located under the purview of the
Department of Homeland Security.36 However, some open access ice core
data is publicly available, and ice core research doesn't always require
trips to "the field" but can utilize previously accumulated ice core
data.]{.underline}** **[The earliest forms of ice core research were
completed at Camp Century, an extensive subsurface nuclear powered
American military facility in Kalaallit Nuunat by individuals associated
with the US Army Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Research Establishment
(sipre) in the early 1950s.]{.underline}**37 **[As part of the North
American Treaty Organization (nato), the United States and Denmark
struck a deal that allowed the United States to build military bases in
Greenland without consent from Indigenous peoples of those
lands.]{.underline}** [In 1959, the construction of Camp Century helped
to further facilitate early ice core practices. Camp Century was
utilized as an access point to subterranean ice worlds for testing sites
of the detonation of ballistic missiles under the ice.38 This
experimental nuclear powered subterranean camp was meant to act as a
year- round living facility for two hundred people.39 Now, the physical,
chemical, biological, and radiological wastes left at the camp are
leeching into the surrounding environment due to their abandonment and

### Ice Loss\-\--1NC

#### The loss of ice is spectacularized to justify colonial expansion

**Dodds** and Smith **23**, Professor of Geopolitics, University of
London (Klaus, and Jen Rose. \"Against decline? The geographies and
temporalities of the Arctic cryosphere.\" The Geographical Journal 189.3
(2023): 388-397. Accessed: 6/17/25)

In our reading of the Arctic, [we argue that contemporary Arctic
geopolitical discourse too often pivots around simple causalities such
as less sea ice equates to growth in maritime traffic and possible
geopolitical tension]{.underline} (for a critical review, Depledge,
2019). [This in turn invites a phalanx of technical-scientific experts
to qualify claims about the preponderance of open water or dampen down
expectations that the Arctic will inevitably be a global maritime
highway. These are particular and familiar colonial moves towards
possessing the Arctic]{.underline}. The relationship between colonialism
and northern territories, including water, is not straightforward given
that many of those lands incorporated into colonial-nation states such
as Canada, the United States and Russia that utilised varying projects,
tactics and techniques to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands,
lifeways and livelihoods (Kollin, 2001; Ruiz et al., 2019). [What is
often understood as a settler impulse to eliminate to replace by way of
genocidal warfare is not neatly projected onto landscapes of the Arctic,
especially in thinking of the particularly situated (ongoing) colonial
histories in Alaska and Canada]{.underline}. The enactment of allotment,
and terra-forming forest and plain into agriculture including ranching,
though attempted, was not successfully replicated further north. The
early needs for resource extraction as animating the core principle of
settler-racial-capitalism was not easily met by virtue of the presence
of ice and glacier fields of Arctic landscapes. [Colonial movements and
travels in search of the Northwest/east Passage of the white nationalist
race to the illusive North Pole were temporary and fleeting---apart from
later public policy directed towards the encouragement and support of
homesteaders and gold miners to populate northern spaces, colonial
actors in the North often did not come to stay. Elemental substances
such as frozen earth, sea ice and glaciers were surveyed, mapped and
manipulated, with colonial agents seeking to thaw out permafrost and
restructure parts of the Arctic landscape in terms of agriculture. The
needs of colonial desires to cultivate particular foods in particular
ways that aligned with property making through labour and land were
thwarted by ice and its liminal shapes of constituting land not
water]{.underline} (Smith, 2021).

The [coupling of scientific expertise and racist legal policies of
dispossession ultimately created similar outcomes of longstanding
oppressive colonial regimes that continue to constitute the
present.]{.underline} For one example, [plans such as the so-called
Inuit High Arctic relocations in the early 1950s were hatched in Canada
to resettle Indigenous communities in what is for now understood as
northern Quebec, as part of a strategic calculation designed to populate
a 'sparse and spartan' northern territory.]{.underline} The [relocation
strategy proved to be a costly and devastating failure, as it was built
upon the notions that all cold climates are ostensibly the same and
therefore Indigenous peoples should be able to live successfully within
them---racist thinking that either misunderstands or overlooks centuries
of relationships built across Indigenous peoples and more-than-human
kin]{.underline}. At the base of this thinking is a temperate-normative
assumption that an adapted cold weather community in one part of
northern Canada could simply be trans-located for the purpose of filling
a less populated area. The Inuit High Arctic relocations serve as a
poignant reminder of how the initiatives of relocation are currently
iterative---at one moment in the 1950s[, Indigenous peoples of the
Arctic are made to undergo enforced relocation by decision of a
colonial-nation-state meant to 'uplift' or to meet the end of an act of
colonial sovereignty, but in the contemporary moment in which Native
peoples find their homes underwater due to carbon consequences, those
same nation-states will not assist in relocation efforts]{.underline}
(Audlaluk, 2020).

The [storification of the extent and thickness of sea ice is integral to
Arctic geopolitics---often framed as loss followed by revelation and
enhanced activity and engagement by Arctic and non-Arctic states and
stakeholders]{.underline} (Dodds, 2010, Dittmer et al., 2011). There
have been three aspects to all of this that we believe deserve more
explicit and considered attention. [Fundamentally, further attention
needs to be given to how these analogies of sea ice work to produce
different framings and relationships within and beyond the Arctic.
First, we might ask what is the role of sea ice as 'buffer' rather than
'barrier' and/or 'hazard', and how does such an analogy complicate
iterative accounts of sea ice\'s annual rates of extent or shrinkage
(with the inference being that less sea ice extent and thickness means
more likelihood of activity and possible conflict over the use of polar
waters).]{.underline} [If sea ice is considered to be a barrier then
that implies that there is either an obstacle to movement (which someone
or thing wishes to cross) and/or that there is a distinction to be made
between one area or another. For example, the term barrier reef is used
to signify an ecological space betwixt shallow water and
shoreline]{.underline}. Whereas sea ice as a material barrier is often
used to help identify the Arctic Ocean as distinct from the warmer
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sea ice as buffer foregrounds something
quite different; in this rendering[, ice is said to perform a series of
ecological services including regulating ocean temperature, reflecting
heat away from ocean and absorbing the energy released by wave action;
whereas sea ice as hazard is framed as such because commercial and
military shipping wishes to traverse ice-covered waters]{.underline}.
Tropes such as 'polar Mediterranean' have long been used to re-configure
the Arctic Ocean and maritime passages as capable, at some point, of
being usable (Steinberg, 2014).

\[TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\]

This shift in the framing of sea ice has developed in two distinct
areas. In stories about climate change and coastal communities in
Alaska, it has become increasingly common to recognise the 'buffering'
effect sea ice plays in mitigating the erosive damage done by winter
storms to coastlines. The intersection between shoreland, water and ice
is thus recognised as interstitial space; with a capacity to absorb and
deflect wave energy away from the rock, soil and sand of the coastline.
A reduction in multi-year sea ice with thinner annual or young sea ice
in turn reveals buffering limits; thicker sea ice being far more likely
to be able to absorb the energy associated with wave action. We see this
enacted in real time with the recent typhoon Merbok that moved through
the Bering Strait and left many coastal communities with damaged homes
and destroyed subsistence infrastructure. Another way sea ice scientists
have framed sea ice is to posit it as a 'lid' to acidification, which is
caused by the ocean becoming saturated with carbon dioxide emissions.
Younger sea ice in particular being less able to act as a 'lid' to both
warming and amplification trends. With less sea ice, open water is
better able to absorb heat and disrupt in turn the relationship between
water, ice and air. Acidifying waters have direct implications for
future biodiversity, as some creatures including shell-building
organisms cannot tolerate acidification beyond a certain degree of
concentration. As Cheryl Katz (2019) noted in her investigation of the
acidification of the Arctic Ocean: But as marine carbon levels climb,
more and more carbonate ions are being used up, lowering the ocean\'s
ability to buffer, and causing acidity---measured as a drop in pH---to
rise. Those same carbonate ions are needed by creatures like starfish
and clams, whose shells or skeletons are made of the calcium carbonate
minerals aragonite or calcite ... Melting away the ocean\'s icy lid
exposes yet more water to take up yet more carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. The acidification of Arctic waters has direct implications
for local and Indigenous fishing and shellfish harvesting in coastal
Alaska, with the fastest rate of acidification occurring in the Beaufort
Sea and Bering Sea. Acidification affects growing seasons or molluscs
and crustaceans, reproduction rates and species distribution (for
example, clams and crabs). What the analogy of the 'buffer' does is to
highlight energy transfer rather than simply assume 'disappearance' of
sea ice per se. The relationship between land, sea and air in the Arctic
reveals well the 'vertical reciprocity' between the three, as more open
water means more heat absorption, rising air and water temperatures,
greater acidification and diminishment of multi-year ice (Adey, 2010).

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\]

S[econd, sea ice and its relationship to scientific-military imaginaries
and practices reveals polar waters to be hazard rather than buffer---an
obstacle to unfettered mobility. Contemporary iterations of Arctic
geopolitics owe their poignancy to earlier antecedents. During the Cold
War, sea ice was conceptualised as a barrier to movement]{.underline}
(Roberts, 2015). A slippery subject that would prove a difficult
adversary for submarine captains as rival naval forces. Countries such
as Canada established national ice services in the 1950s to provide
further coverage and assessment for shipping users. [Sea ice research,
and for that matter permafrost science, was in part funded by national
governments to enable and improve awareness and understanding of
ice-covered waters and cold environments]{.underline} (and Indigenous
knowledges and expertise enrolled if often under-acknowledged). In [the
military arena, institutions such as the Office of Naval Research and
the US Arctic Submarine Laboratory in Barrow Alaska were charged with
funding research that sought to make ice more knowable, predictable and
governable. And yet the memoirs of US nuclear submarine captains and
published research on sea ice revealed the opposite---sea ice was and is
notoriously dynamic, confusing and unsettling to those seeking to go
under it, transit it at the surface and/or break through from
below]{.underline} (for example, McLaren, 2008). Depending on
seasonality, wind direction, ocean temperatures and currents, militaries
and scientists were involved in a host of national and international
initiatives designed to improve seasonal charting, environmental
management plans, strategic patrols, and resource extractions plans.
Richard Powell\'s work on Canadian scientific authority in the 1950s
illustrates well the manner in which sea ice was caught up with
sovereign and security agendas (Powell, 2017).

[Coastal states such as Russia and Canada were also eager to ensure that
their ice-covered waters were properly protected--- environmentally and
legally---from transit traffic]{.underline} (Steinberg et al., 2015). In
the 1960s and 1970s, [Canadian governments in particular were alarmed by
the prospect of US oil tanker traffic going backwards and forwards from
Alaska via the Northwest Passage]{.underline}. The [presence of sea ice
acted as a politically helpful shipping hazard and thus possible
deterrent to foreign-registered ships wishing to cross through waters
the Canadian authorities considered to be 'historic' rather than subject
to transit rights.]{.underline} While Canada put in place additional
environmental regulatory safe-guarding measures (for example, the 1970
Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act), the Northwest Passage remains a
source of official legal disagreement between Canada and the United
States. [Diminishing sea ice, thus, acts as a catalyst for speculation
about whether this **waterway** might **become a source of future
friction** either because the waters are thought to be in principle less
hazardous (]{.underline}a point that is often contested by shipping and
sea ice experts alike) or because relevant details of the United Nations
Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS and Article 234) for 'ice-covered
areas' are thought to be less relevant in operational terms. As the
Article in question notes:

> Coastal States have the right to adopt and enforce non-discriminatory
> laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of
> marine pollution from vessels in ice-covered areas within the limits
> of the exclusive economic zone, where particularly severe climatic
> conditions and the presence of ice covering such areas for most of the
> year \[i.e. 6 months and one day\] create obstructions or exceptional
> hazards to navigation, and pollution of the marine environment could
> cause major harm to or irreversible disturbance of the ecological
> balance.

Article 234 was the only example of where UNCLOS recognised the presence
of ice-covered areas. Later the UN body the International Maritime
Organisation\'s Polar Code (entered into force in 2017) sets out
requirements for shipping entering and leaving polar waters. [While
acknowledging that coastal communities 'in the Arctic could be, and that
polar ecosystems are, vulnerable to human activities, such as ship
operation']{.underline} (emphasis added, Polar Code 2017). While the
Polar Code noted a 'could be' for possible impacts on Arctic coastal
communities of climate change[, it addresses the operational challenges
posed by sea ice with considerable assertiveness. Sea ice is framed
throughout as a technical problem that can be mitigated by collective
action. Solutions to sea ice will emerge through legal, technological
and training interventions.]{.underline}

Third[, sea ice as register of global rather than local or Indigenous
futures]{.underline}. [When coastal communities in Alaska are posited as
on the frontline of climate change, sea ice and permafrost are
**spectacularised** in the sense of being made to stand for a
**harbinger of an unwanted global future**]{.underline} (Bronen, 2010).
There is [often a slippage between the **everyday** and local and the
**global** and planetary]{.underline}. [What gets lost in this slippage
is the notion that ice/frost/snow become caught up in an extractive
economy which prioritises the ramifications for extra-territorial
parties, global elemental spaces and the 'buffering' affordances of ice
and frozen ground]{.underline}. The [Arctic is in crisis primarily
because it will not keep its frozen ground frozen and its sea ice
intact. The very thing that Cold War frontier engineers dreamed of
annihilating is now being cursed for not being resilient enough
(]{.underline}Fleming, 2010). [We further assert for a ground to
articulate an Arctic that does not lose the verifiable danger and
precarity of ice melt and the livelihoods that continue to be changed,
transformed and dispossessed, which is largely consequential from the
enactments of racial capitalism but that also holds a refusal to fall
victim to an alarmist, polemical, devastation and declensionist
narrative.]{.underline} The declensionist narrative is one that has been
historical and often wielded to discuss Indigenous peoples and their
inevitable disappearance conveniently from resource rich areas. Care
must be taken when reporting the disappearance of ice. As Inupiaq poet
Joan Naviyuk Kane writes:

> Much of the discourse around the Arctic and Indigenous people
> preoccupies itself with destruction ... It is couched in either the
> concrete documentation of disappearance---erosion or submersion of
> land due to climate change or climate-caused displacement, for
> instance---or in the figurative language of loss (cited in Nunatsiaq
> News, 2018)

Taking up Kane\'s project, [is there a way to identify the enactments of
colonialism without a spectacularised event of damage, loss and the
horror of that loss, as the vessel of discussion?]{.underline} And [is
it possible to have that conversation without lioning Indigenous
resilience as a life-lesson for non-indigenous peoples
elsewhere]{.underline}? As Eve Tuck and C. Ree put it:

> Damage narratives are the only stories that get told about me, unless
> I\'m the one that\'s telling them. People have made their careers on
> telling stories of damage about me, about communities like mine.
> Damage is the only way that monsters and future ghosts are conjured
> (Tuck and Ree, 2013)

[tek, then, is often **essentialized** and forced into a container as
though it could exist in an apolitical and ahistorical form severed from
the relations it co- constitutes. There is a tendency to reduce
Indigenous knowledges **to something only** botanical, **ecological**,
or somehow **about sustainability**, conservation, or preservation. As
Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq argues, "**Indigenous knowledges** are **not
secondary** to western, 'scientific' ones.]{.underline} Indeed Inuit
knowledges of our lands and waters are scientific, sovereign, and often
sacred . . . these knowledges come from our communities observing,
interacting, surviving together, and depending on the same lands and
waters where our ancestors existed." 62 There is a [drive to incorporate
local Indigenous knowledges on the ground]{.underline}, separate from
political relationships in which they are embroiled, [to build a better
set of representations for data, figures, and, inevitably, policy. This
**is an inadequate framing** as Indigenous science and knowledge sets
**cannot be bracketed**; **they are ongoing relations and practices**
that are political, juridical, and spiritual and must be consistently
maintained and reiterated]{.underline}.63 It is not Indigenous peoples'
responsibility to save what has been contemporarily cast as a dying
planet. [Native peoples, communities, and polities are boxed by colonial
regimes that make it appear as though they should save a dying earth as
mythologically, inherently land- based people--- and not that they might
have their own strategies as sovereign entities who govern as they best
see fit. One way that Arctic Indigenous knowledges have been usurped
through add- and- stir tactics of inclusion is through scientific
**research projects that laud collaborative methodologies without
meaningful engagement and representation**]{.underline}. In 2020,
Kawerak, Inc., a regional non-profit corporation serving the Bering
Straits Region organized under the auspices of ancsa, wrote a letter
addressed to the National Science Foundation's polar program Navigating
the New Arctic (nna). The letter indicted poor research practices and
included statements such as: We cannot overstate the need for true
collaboration among Indigenous Peoples . . . we have grave concerns
about the impacts from the nna process and funded projects to date. The
nna has funded projects that claim . . . to be collaborative, to do
knowledge coproduction, to include partnerships with Indigenous
communities, and to address questions that will 'help' or 'assist'
Arctic residents. [Many of these projects (and many more which were not
funded) do not and will not fulfill any of those claims.64 This
important statement resonates with Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq's urgent call
for equitable, meaningful collaboration with Indigenous peoples in
Arctic science research]{.underline}. Itchuaqiyaq writes, I have been
researched. My family has been researched. We have given access to
ourselves, our experiences, our ancestral knowledges, and our homes to
fulfill others' ambitions, all in the hope that these actions can help
our community. We have trusted others to depict our lives, experiences,
knowledges, and communities fairly and accurately. We have lent our
social capital to outsiders and vouched for them so that they may gain
access into the homes of others in our community. We have incurred risk.
/ Tell me: What risk have you incurred?65 These calls for responsible
scientific engagement with Arctic Indigenous communities don't arrive
from nowhere. In this moment of climate change, the most dominant form
of ordering and narrating ice geographies is made through understanding
ice as a scientific dataset. Ice as a material for objective
laboratorial analysis is often severed from the political and social
contexts from which it was removed toward the goal of telling planetary
stories. [Scientific data has long been extracted from the Arctic and
continues in contemporary forms such as through drone imagery and
satellite data that tracks sea ice melt and glacial retreat.66 The
technologies to surveil, track, speculate, and predict ice melt **seem
to proliferate** with the minute.]{.underline}

### Land Development Link\-\--1NC

#### Land is a flattened georgraphy that is weaponized by the Global North to force Indigenous people into submission.

**[Land as flattened geometry is just one part of the
issue.]{.underline}** As Meredith Palmer argues, **[the metrics of
measuring land are embroiled with histories of anti- Indigenous racism
in what she calls "the racist acre."]{.underline}** 11 **[Colonial and
imperial tools and tactics of measuring and observing land try to make
it into inanimate materiality for capitalist accumulation, sacrifice,
and often abandonment over and against Indigenous
relationship]{.underline}**s.12 Max Liboiron, following Sandra Styres
and Dawn Zinga, has described **[that process as one of making Land into
land.]{.underline}**13 In this formulation, **[Land refers to "the
unique entity that is the combined living spirit of plants, animals,
air, water, humans, histories, and events recognized by many Indigenous
communities. When land is not capitalized \[land\] refers to the concept
from a colonial worldview whereby landscapes are common, universal, and
everywhere, even with great variation."]{.underline}** 14 **[Capital L
Land is relations; small l land is resource.]{.underline}** Tuck and
McKenzie write correctly, then, that "**[Indigenous intellectual
contributions rarely fail to engage in issues of land and place---
especially via conceptualizations of tribal identity, sovereignty, and
treaty rights--- yet when these discussions are taken up by non-
Indigenous and settler scholars, the saliency of land and place is
frequently left out of the picture."]{.underline}** 15 Put another way,
**[it is not simply a problem that land is flattened into passive static
space through technology and narrative alike, but that those flattenings
are also the overlooking, undermining, and an attempted severing of
Native sovereignties and relationships.]{.underline}** [Staying
attentive to the ways that land has been designated, measured,
surveilled, and documented through technologies that are anti-
Indigenous demonstrate the need by Native thinkers to continue to
describe and reclaim land relationalities in scholarship and in
practice.**16 Enactments of colonialism also coerce Native peoples to
regard, discuss, and interact with land in strategic
formulations**]{.underline}. Often, **[those strategies are necessarily
iterative, as colonialism is as historical as it is a contemporary
project, maintaining and making itself anew]{.underline}**. [Native
polities, communities, and individuals have had to employ what Gayatri
Spivak has called "strategic essentialism" to keep homelands under
Native governance]{.underline}.17 [This is not always how Native people
may want to formulate relationships to their lands. Federal and state
sponsored colonial projects are often beyond the control and purview of
Native peoples, communities, and polities, such as allotment and
property- making, identity regimes of blood quantum calculations,
removal and relocation from homelands, theft of children and placement
into boarding schools, pollution, and environmental racism.]{.underline}
**[These are all colonial land relations that most often require(d)
military force and simultaneous if not subsequential bureaucratic
violences.]{.underline}** As Michelle Daigle has written,
**["Theorizations of colonial conquest, resistance, and liberation
require interrogations of the fixed spatialities and temporalities that
Indigenous peoples continue to be relegated to discursively and
materially."]{.underline}** 18 [These ongoing histories not only
continue to shape the lives and politics of Native peoples who relate to
more temperate lands, they also shape the ways that ice geographies and
Indigenous Arctic peoples must strategize and articulate their specific
relations to ice]{.underline}. **[Arctic Indigenous peoples feel the
climate aftermaths of lands extracted and turned inside- out in more
temperate Indigenous territories elsewhere. Indigenous Arctic ice
geographies are often negatively compared to more easily capitalist
extracted, temperate Indigenous lands further south and rendered
desolate, empty, or violable]{.underline}**. Yet, as Sheila Watt-
Cloutier writes, **["The Arctic may seem cold and dark to those who
don't know it well, but for us a day of hunting or fishing brought the
most succulent, nutritious food. Then there would be the intense joy as
we gathered together as a family and friends, sharing and partaking of
the same animal in a communal meal, to live in a boundless landscape and
a close- knit culture in which everything matters. . . . Like
generations of Inuit, I bonded with the ice and snow."]{.underline}** 19
[In a similar sentiment to Watt- Cloutier, Leslie Marmon Silko writes in
her essay "Interior and Exterior Landscapes" about relationships to
desert places: Hopi Pueblo elders said that the austere and, to some
eyes, barren plains and hills surrounding their mesa- top villages in
northeast Arizona actually help nurture the spirituality of the Hopi way
. . . the Hopi people might have settled in locations far more lush. . .
.But there on the high, silent, sandstone mesas that overlook the sandy,
arid expanses stretching to all horizons,]{.underline} **[the Hopi
elders say the Hopi people must "live by their prayers." Great
abundances of things . . . tend to lure human attention away from what
is most valuable and important.20 For Silko the desert offers a
relationship that supports and enriches a spiritual relationship, most
important above all in her sensibility.]{.underline}** Across Silko and
Watt- Cloutier, **[the landscapes of ice and desert are crucially life-
giving and sustaining. Many of the technologies used to measure and make
land into property don't neatly map onto desert or ice, defying what
settler law might try to make of it or make it into.]{.underline}**

**[The strategic, and often necessary, utilization of accepted colonial
interpretation of what counts as land and land relations has resulted in
keeping some homelands intact, yet it is not without
consequences]{.underline}**. As Goeman writes, **[To claim land, it is
set up through the court systems that we must claim difference from
settlers. In our pursuit to differentiate our- selves from settler
colonists, we have territorialized land and body. The legal tensions
between stability and static versus change, adaptation, and growth are
very real for indigenous people]{.underline}**. [They are in a
particularly difficult political situation in which recognition of
cultural and racial uniqueness is detrimental to the overall physical
and cultural survival of indigenous people.]{.underline}26 **[These
kinds of land relations framed through a categorical difference from
whiteness as enforced and determined by settler law are at once the
mechanism that allows Native peoples to claim their land and also
creates harm in an identification of self and community.]{.underline}**
[The original moment of articulating difference from colonists to make
claims to homeland is not a singular event. This difference must be
reiterated over time to maintain access to land and things like treaty
rights. Legal relationships to land are also not homogenous. The
opportunity to legally claim difference from colonists as precedent for
land claims and land rights, such as in Alaska, Hawaii, and in many
places in California, does not always exist.]{.underline} **[In many
places, no treaties were signed, and there is no legal or priority
access for Native peoples to their land relations. In Alaska, legal
conflict over what are called "subsistence rights" (access to whaling,
fishing, hunting, and gathering) continues into the contemporary moment.
When Alaska Native people demonstrated and lobbied for their subsistence
rights, those rights were denied by state legislature as
unconstitutional, race- based privileges.]{.underline}** **[Herein lies
one dimension of the problematic identified by Goeman: when rights are
articulated through racial difference in settler courts, they can also
be denied on those same grounds.]{.underline}** However[, in the case of
Alaska, the denial of subsistence rights flies in the face of
subsistence access legally falling under the auspices of federal Indian
law, not a state-level decision.]{.underline}27 **[Anti-Indigeneity that
operates to remove Native peoples from their lands continues the need to
further centralize the importance of land.]{.underline}** [This need,
unfortunately, also potentially minimizes conceptual space allowed for
water and ice and an analysis of how these elements cannot come into
categorial formation in ways that land is afforded. Put another way, the
colonial category of land as easily measured or captured by technology
and law can disallow other categories and relations, like water and ice,
to be claimed.]{.underline} **[Thus, Native studies must continue to
support Native polities' processes of land reclamation while
simultaneously contesting the legitimacy of settler- colonial
governments to determine such meanings.]{.underline}** **[The urgency
within the field toward land reflects the urgency of the politics on the
ground. The feedback loop of land relations, land theft, land rights,
land claims, land back, land scholarship is a loop precisely because of
the ongoing elements of land dispossession and enacted
coloniality.]{.underline}** Moreover, [because of the precarity around
land dispossession and the need to continually articulate land relations
in forms legible to settler courts, scholarship in Native studies that
pushes inquiries around reframing land differently can be read as
dangerous and potentially against grounded movements]{.underline}. With
this important reality in mind, **[I worry about the colonial grounding
of the concept of land that forces it to carry everything we ask it to.

categories.]{.underline}**

[**One cannot talk about climate change without discussing oil and gas,
of which the Arctic is a major site of extraction.** The Arctic
Environmental Responsibility Index was created in 2021 by a group of
multinational academics (]{.underline}Overland et al 2021). [Oil and gas
companies operating in the Arctic were evaluated on criteria of how they
were minimizing harm to local ecosystems and Indigenous people near
their operations (ibid). **Out of all the Arctic countries, the
companies that are headquartered in the American Empire average the
highest ratings while the Russian Empire has the worst environmental
ratings (ibid).** Trends within the data showed that oil and gas
companies have a better rating than mining, likely because mining is
inland while oil is offshore (ibid). However, the Arctic Environmental
Responsibility Index lacks an analysis of scale.]{.underline} **[The
lowest-ranking company, based in Russia, has a mere 2 percent of the
revenues of the highest-ranking company from Norway]{.underline}**
("Rating of the Largest Russian Companies by Sales Volume" 2018).
[**While larger corporations score higher on the index, their
environmental impact may be higher due to the sheer amount of resource
extraction undergone.** The oil, coal and gas extracted by these
companies create the chemical byproducts of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons]{.underline} (PAHs) ("Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"
2009). [**This group includes hundreds of compounds that are recognized
as carcinogens, impacting not only human health but also marine
microorganisms---such as bacteria and fungi---that form the foundation
of the entire food web (ibid).** Climate change and the release of PAHs
are intertwined in a positive feedback loop, as rising temperatures in
the Arctic accelerate the melting of sea ice]{.underline} (Christensen
2024). [Traditionally, sea ice has trapped PAHs, preventing their
harmful effects from reaching marine organism]{.underline}s (Stow, Sova,
and Reimer 2005). **[However, as this ice continues to melt, more PAHs
are released into the marine ecosystem]{.underline}** (Christensen
2024). **[Current climate projections suggest that an ice-free Arctic
summer could occur as early as 2030, even with substantial reductions in
emissions, potentially resulting in a dramatic increase in PAHs in
marine environments]{.underline}** (Kim et al 2023). **[It isn't just
marine Arctic ecosystems that are suffering. The evidence is in the
soil. Soil acts as one of the world's primary storage of carbon, keeping
it away from the atmosphere and thereby mitigating climate
change]{.underline}** (Volkova 2021). [Half of the global supply of soil
organic carbon is in the Arctic (Thawing Arctic Peatlands Risk Unlocking
Huge Amounts of Carbon" 2019).]{.underline} [These 1.7 trillion tons of
carbon in the Arctic predominantly come from peat, an organic soil that
is made out of partially decomposed plant matter]{.underline}
("Histosols" 2024). [Like sea ice, much of these soils remain frozen
year-round, hence the name permafrost]{.underline} (Tvid et al 2012).
**[But as accelerating warming thaws this permafrost, the previously
frozen soil gains moisture (ibid).]{.underline}** [As water moves
through the deepest layers of the soil, the wet peat gets exposed to
oxygen and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere]{.underline}
(Pearce 2017**[). The thawing of permafrost also awakens microbes deep
in the ground, who find these warming temperatures ideal for growing
(ibid).]{.underline}** [Like humans, microbes release greenhouse gasses
as a byproduct of their daily respiration]{.underline} (Barbato et al
2022). **[And so more microbes means more greenhouse gasses in the
atmosphere (ibid). However, not all microbes are reacting to climate
change equally, leading to uneven microbe population distribution which
threatens the microbial ecosystem and subsequently the health of the
soil]{.underline}** (Mallard & Pearce 2018). [These effects are
complicated by the soil ecosystem differences across the Arctic, all of
which remain vastly under-researched]{.underline} (Barbato et al 2022).
**[A possible analysis from the Arctic Responsibility Index is that the
blame for colonialism in the Arctic has shifted from the state to
corporations, but out of the 120 companies listed on the index, 15 are
state-owned]{.underline}** (Overland et al 2021). **[The most
environmentally responsible company is one of them.]{.underline}** [The
Norwegian government has a 67% stake in this company named Equinor ("Our
Shareholders"). In 2022 the oil corporation posted record profits,
leaving the government with a payout of 11.390 billion
dollars]{.underline} ("Equinor Fourth Quarter 2022 and Year End
Results").1 Another Norse state-owned oil company, Petoro is ranked
number 33 (Overland et al 2021). [This business also benefited from the
sanctions on Russian oil in 2022, pulling 48.356 billion dollars for the
country]{.underline} (SDFI and Petoro Annual Report 2022). [The
government revenues from these two companies comprised a full ten
percent of the 2022 national GDP (T]{.underline}rading Economics 2024).

[Known as Natchiq in the Inupiaq language, ringed seals are top
predators in the Arctic (NOAA Fisheries).]{.underline} **[Sea ice is
integral to the seal's livelihoods, which is why these animals stay in
the Arctic and surrounding regions]{.underline}** (National Wildlife
Federation). [They are the most common seal species.]{.underline} **[The
changing climate has melted the amount of sea ice that these seals
depend on, leading to increased cortisol levels that indicate chronic
stress]{.underline}** (Ogloff 2022). **[Seals with higher stress also
tend to have less blubber depth, which is correlated with a lower state
of health overall]{.underline}** (ibid). [Such grim health effects are
shown in how pollution is changing the cells and genes of the ringed
seals. **Ringed seals are now having significant expressions of the ARNT
gene, which is associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
dioxins (Boyi 2022).**]{.underline} [The cells of ringed seals also
produced increased levels of a protein called IL-2 (ibid). This is meant
to spur the body into an immune response, which means that the seals are
attempting to fight off the pollutants]{.underline}. **[However, this
state of constant defense against the pollutants can weaken the overall
immune response]{.underline}** (Ogloff 2022). [As such, the ringed seals
are susceptible to a mass casualty event in the case of an epidemic
(ibid). However, this is not the most pressing issue of seal consumption
by Indigenous people: the contaminants in the Arctic Ocean from shipping
and pollution also lead to increased mercury and selenium in the
fish]{.underline} (Simola 2024). [After consuming mercury and
selenium-laden fish, the seals metabolize these substances into a new
compound: mercuric selenide (ibid**). Although this is non-toxic to the
seals, it is harmful to human health once consumed, particularly to the
kidneys and the central nervous system**]{.underline} ("Mercury
Selenide" 2024). [These perilous effects are no doubt worsened by the
lack of access to medical care in rural areas of the Arctic, as
specialized doctors are only available through taking a flight. Seal is
a vital food source for the Inuit, as grocery prices remain exorbitantly
expensive in the Arctic due to high shipping costs. **As everything in
the Arctic is imported, prices like thirty-three Canadian dollars for a
two-pack of Nutella are commonplace (Allen 2023). In such remote areas,
there are few job opportunities except for hunting**]{.underline}
(Jessen 2015). [The Inuit use every part of the seal, not simply for
food but to create traditional water-resistant clothing for the winter
("Why is the Seal Vital for Indigenous Communities?" 2022). Even without
the necessity, hunting seals]{.underline} [is integral to passing down
cultural hunting knowledge to future generations]{.underline} (Sarmiento
2019). The Contradictions of the State and Settler Scientists **[As
settlers, we have historically benefitted from these government
assimilationist and polluting policies, and therefore the state's
actions reflect our own.]{.underline}** **[This shifting of
responsibilities should awaken settler colonial amnesia of those
involved in the Arctic. This is a phenomenon where people are not fully
aware of the colonialism that they benefit from (Said
1994).]{.underline}** **[It can manifest in obscuring the scale of the
atrocities or even flat-out denial. This misremembering leads to the
invalidation of those dealing with the effects of colonialism, and the
creation of false justifications for the violence.]{.underline}** **[The
settler scientific community is particularly culpable, as our research
into the specific effects of climate change not only ignores our own
role in creating such ecological violence through our privileged
membership in the state, but also how our scientific research is often
largely funded by the state.]{.underline}** [The National Science
Foundation, established in 1950, is a federal government agency of the
United States that funds scientific research]{.underline} ("History,"
2024).2 From the past fiscal year which started on October 1st, 2023 to
September 30, 2024, the National Science Foundation (NSF) was given 9.06
billion dollars. [**This funding is not solely for graduate students but
also undergraduates, academics and even companies, with the requirement
that they must be at least a permanent resident if not a citizen.** The
National Science Foundation has supported the work of at least 268
winners of the Nobel Prize. In 2024 alone, four of the six prize
categories were won by people who have received NSF funding]{.underline}
("NSF Continues Strong Legacy with Nobel Prize Winners," 2024). [This
does not include the multiple other government agencies in the United
States that fund scientific research, particularly the Department of
Defense, the Department of Energy and the Department of
State**.**]{.underline} **[Therefore it is not surprising that the vast
majority of the scientific studies cited in this paper are funded by the
state.]{.underline}** [This is functionally an oxymoronic system where
the state pays largely settler scientists to understand and critique the
systems that have been put into place by the state. This is not to scorn
or shame scientists who receive federal funding. In fact, I myself hope
to obtain a grant from the United States government to pursue a
master\'s degree in Arctic climate ecology.]{.underline} **[As a
researcher coming from a low-income background, such funding would be an
integral lifeline to my career. But in taking funding from the state,
scientists need to acknowledge that this fiscal sponsorship for
environmental research is not charity but rather a continuation of the
long legacy of scientists acting as agents of the state, from the
development of the atomic bomb to the Cold War space race. Even the
colonial developments discussed in this aper such as the Early Distant
Warning Line, oil and gas extraction, and continental shelf claims would
not have been possible without scientists.]{.underline}**

[**The crucial push to retemporalize the golden spike of the Industrial
Revolution to the sixteenth century demands an acknowledgment and
incorporation of histories of violence that shaped the climate of the
globe.** Importantly, this retemporalization argues not only for an
acknowledgment of those histories but that they constitute the political
present]{.underline}. [**I also suggest that there is danger in
replacing one golden spike with another.** Within humanities and social
sciences scholarship there exists an over-privileging and over-
centering of the violence of colonialism, imperialism, and corporeal
violence, especially as historically enacted upon Indigenous peoples in
the Americas.]{.underline} [These histories of violence have been
absented from dominant narratives, and this is not by accident. However,
this also means that narrations of violence overwhelm many fields, and
often testimony is called for if those histories are not rehearsed again
and again.]{.underline} **[Therefore, there is already a humanist
"golden spike" for critical Indigenous studies that becomes the stakes
of the argument in which corporeal, anti- Indigenous violence must
always be illustrated for the reader. Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang put it
this way: "The subaltern can speak, but is only invited to speak her/our
pain."]{.underline}** [Damage- centered research may operate, even
benevolently, within a theory of change in which harm must be recorded
or proven in order to convince an outside adjudicator that reparations
are deserved . . .we observe that much of the work of the academy is to
reproduce stories of oppression in its own voice .]{.underline} . .
**[the collection of pain narratives and the theories of change that
champion the value of such narratives are so prevalent in the social
sciences that one might surmise that they are indeed what the academy is
about.75]{.underline}** [Placing the concept of damage- centered
research into relation with ice core data rendered through the article
by Koch and colleagues, Indigenous populations are incorporated into the
long durée of climate change discourse but only through death and
disappearance. This is inclusion by narration of violence enacted upon
them.]{.underline} **[Critical scholars of race and indigeneity are
pushed to cite the work as evidentiary toward, at most, potential
reparations if not at least remedial education. One hope might be that
through a reckoning with the sixteenth century, experiences of violence
may be better attended, and a more just version of historical enactments
can become a fact to all. I understand Tuck and Yang's argument of
damage- based research and necessitated pain narratives as related to a
bind experienced by academic]{.underline}** fields that Katherine
McKittrick has called "**[identity- disciplines": The incorporation of
"identity" into disciplined learning systems--- the institutionalization
of identity within the context of the university--- has resulted in a
grim reification of biocentric order. . . studying identity so often
involves demonstrating that biology is socially constructed, not
displacing biology, but, rather, empowering biology--- the flesh--- as
the primary way to study identity]{.underline}** . . . and **[identity-
disciplines function to uphold misery and empire and the segregation of
ideas and idea makers precisely because all disciplines are differently
enfleshed and classified and hierarchized . . . For disciplines under
duress--- almost always identity- disciplines]{.underline}**!--- [there
are redoubled costs to doing anticolonial and decolonial work:
participate in the existing system, love and study the categories as
they are, or be harmed. . . . live with the racism and the awfulness you
walk through every day--- and economize it]{.underline}--- [or get
out]{.underline}.76 For McKittrick, there are multiple ways that the
university expects and rewards pain narratives. [Narratives that
reiterate colonial/­ imperial/ racist violence are especially rewarded,
but not only from identity disciplines. Identity disciplines are most
often populated by scholars of difference. Institutionally, those
disciplines are rendered most precarious by the workings of capital and
ongoing ideologies of white supremacy. We are pushed, coerced, and
expected to make violence our golden spike and our experiences of pain
as authentic economies that secure our futures]{.underline}. **[Within
the article by Koch and colleagues, through ice core science, the
violence of the Great Dying is read in the atmosphere. It is the primary
way that Indigenous lives are then rendered legible. This at once erases
Indigenous peoples of ice geographies entangled with ice and conceals
the nonhuman relationships enacted and maintained--- in particular ice,
air, and plant respiration as well as the pollen, trees, mud, and other
storied materialities. Those beings are reduced to data points and
invisibilized in their multidimensional living to make arguments about
the death of specific humans and the aftermaths of those
deaths.]{.underline}** [The use of ice core, charcoal, and pollen data
is toward a measure of reforestation and the change in atmosphere based
on a transition of plant activity, not necessarily a multidimensional
accounting of human life and/or lifeways with plants. Those plants
respirated differently because of a relationship made with specific
humans. As a result of imperial violence, plant life through
reforestation respirated air differently, and this shaped the global
climate through cooling.]{.underline} **[Tree breath and tree breathers
are the populations that hold atmospheric data and in part become the
data upon which ice core arguments rest. In attending to those specific
relationships, the information that plant respirators and other beings
and materialities lend us, there are ways to craft stories that don't
necessitate elision of process, tools, and enactments other than
violence.]{.underline}** **[There are forms of using ice core data,
proxy data, and other forms of coring processes in smaller, local scales
that Indigenous knowledges support. All data comes from somewhere and is
used to make inferences about something. This does not mean violence
needs to be inherent to those processes of retelling. What an
interesting imaginative premise to entertain: asking the mud, pollen,
ice, air bubbles, and tree pollen to be in conversation with one another
about a shared experience or story of being alive, to not again cordon
off and keep information from touching or to only touch if it serves the
dominant narrative.]{.underline}**

settler populations, the welfare state has historically been used as a
tool for Indigenous assimilation in the Arctic.]{.underline}** **[In

Family Allowances to help with the economic effects of the Great
Depression, and the dispatches of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
implemented this policy in the Arctic (McNicoll 1999).]{.underline}**
[As police encroachments continued to disturb the natural ecosystem, the
Canadian government created a system that led to forced reliance on this
government\'s welfare.]{.underline} **[It was only through cash from the

**[Utilizing Western agriculture and attendant sedentarism as a

foreclose other forms of livelihoods as meaningful]{.underline}**. As
Antonello and Carey write, "[All societies do not advance
mechanistically and uniformly through stages of civilization; nor do
they move homogenously and simplistically through modernization or
capitalism or boom- and- bust cycles."]{.underline} 72 **[To use these
markers, even in critique of other problematic indicators like the
Industrial Revolution, is to undermine Indigenous narrations of how they
arrived in any given place and various formations of interacting with

Anthropocene; these narratives mutually reinforce one another as they

specific temperate locales, and therefore one that is largely
incongruous to ice geographies]{.underline}. [Some of the findings in

Antarctic ice sheet, along with other proxy data such as charcoal and

**[histories of imperial violence such as the use of enslavement,
starvation, and biological warfare are not included.]{.underline}**
[Those Indigenous peoples who are most directly entangled with the
colonial histories of ice and ice geographies are again kept on the
periphery. **Ice is enlisted to tell a specific kind of story that does
not account for its particular relation to historical and ongoing
colonization, and the processes of analysis that ice undergoes to be

complexities of lives lived and nuanced seasons of climate but are
haphazard sealed bits of small atmospheric information saved at
random.]{.underline} **[Certainly, proxy data of all forms can provide

Price is emphatic in his assertion, '\[T\]here was no suggestion during
the Hague conferences that the use of asphyxiating shells was to be
regarded as legitimate against "uncivilized" nations.'37 Price insists,
'\[T\]here was no active establishment by those present that this
contractual language simultaneously legitimized and positively
sanctioned certain uses of asphyxiating shells (for example, against
nonparticipants) against those outside the ken of the civilized family
of nation.'38 On the contrary, there is a suggestion that '[one of the
qualifications of a civilized nation was to]{.underline} [partake in the
regulation of warfare]{.underline} that began among the European society
of states in the mid-nineteenth century' and '[the contractual language
of the]{.underline} [prohibition]{.underline} [was a legitimizing
inducement to join the society of civilized states]{.underline}, [an
invitation to self-discipline]{.underline}.'39 [The irony
of]{.underline} such [an 'invitation to self-discipline']{.underline}
[is]{.underline} succinctly [captured]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
[Albert Memmi as he observes how a]{.underline} deliberately
constituted, [asymmetrical relationship of power between]{.underline}
the [colonizers]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[colonized]{.underline} [emerged during this period]{.underline}:
[While]{.underline} **[it is pardonable for the colonizer to have his
little arsenals]{.underline}**, **[the discovery of even a rusty weapon
among the colonized is cause for immediate punishment]{.underline}**.
The Arab fantasia has become nothing more than the act of a trained
animal which is asked to roar, as he used to, to frighten the guests.
But the animal roars extremely well; and nostalgia for arms is always
present, and is part of all ceremonies in Africa, from north to south.
The lack of implements of war appears proportional to the size of the
colonialist forces; the most isolated tribes are still the first to pick
up these weapons. This is not a proof of savagery, but only evidence
that the conditioning is not sufficiently maintained.40 These
[limitations]{.underline} [were imposed by experiences of vulnerability
and fear that the colonial subjects might use]{.underline} [these
weapons against their]{.underline} own [colonial masters]{.underline}.41
This sense of fear and vulnerability in the West was further reinforced
with nineteenth-century memories of the African 'primary resistance' and
Indian 'mutinies for independence' which fundamentally altered
colonizers' attitudes toward their colonies.42The defeat of the Italians
by the Ethiopians in 1896 represented 'the first decisive victory gained
by troops that may be reckoned as oriental over a European army in the
open field, for at least three centuries.'43 The Japanese victory in the
Russo-Japanese war in 1905 was much publicized and 'presented not as a
local triumph of one nation over another, but as a victory with global
implications, of the Mongolian people over the European.'44 The
[military victories of]{.underline} the [non-European
powers]{.underline} [were touted to rouse racial anxieties]{.underline}
to 'hold the racial line.'45 Gunther et al. in their exploration of 'The
West: a securitizing community?' argue that '[the performative effects
of a security semantics in which "the West" figures as the
threatened]{.underline}, [yet]{.underline} notoriously [vague referent
object]{.underline} [that has to be defended]{.underline} against
alleged challenges' [generate a 'rhetorical heat']{.underline} [that
sanctions]{.underline} [a culture of 'self-assertion]{.underline},
self-authorization and self-immunization.'46 It is through [these
practices of 'rhetorical instrumentalization' that 'the West' exercises
a]{.underline} 'performative **[power to construct politically relevant
distinctions' between 'the West' and the 'non-West']{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [at the same time encourages allusive references to
the impending threats from the 'non-West]{.underline}.'47 There was a
need for 'constant preparedness,' and [weapons technologies
'considered]{.underline} [too horrific to use against
Europeans']{.underline} such as 'the notorious Maxim gun and dumdum
bullet or the French Coloniale bomber' [were]{.underline}
'[developed]{.underline} specifically [for]{.underline} [colonial
use]{.underline}.'48 Salter argues that 'the imperial origin of the
machine gun and strategic bombing is not insignificant' as 'aerial
bombing was first conducted in the colonial context' and Asia and Africa
had been 'pacified' with the help of the machine gun.49 It was [the
necessity of maintaining order]{.underline} [and]{.underline} exercising
[control over colonial possessions]{.underline} that
[constituted]{.underline} '**[a specific colonial form of arms control
as governmentality]{.underline}**, [whereby]{.underline} [mechanisms of
prohibition]{.underline} and prescription [were]{.underline} both [put
to the service of governing which peoples could legitimately use what
kind of arms]{.underline}.'50 For example, successive legislation was
enforced in British India in 1858, 1860, 1878 and 1909 to constantly
refine and revise 'who had the right to own, import, export, and produce
what kind of arms, where they could be transferred to, and under what
conditions.'51 These '[regulations]{.underline} [were not just
about]{.underline} the effective [management of arms]{.underline} flows
[but also]{.underline} an intrinsic [part of the process by which
imperial gradations of race, culture, and threat]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} actually [produced]{.underline}.'52 [They were
'predicated on a moral economy in which European norms of racial
superiority]{.underline} and imperialism [framed the standards of

### China Threat Link\-\--1NC

#### Their reading of China's rise is [alarmist]{.underline}, [self-fulfilling]{.underline} and leads to [racial profiling]{.underline}.

Sociology @ the University of British Columbia. (François, "Media
Securitizer and the Racist 'China-Threat' Discourse---Ascension, Peak,
And Downfall," Manuscript, University of British Columbia -- Vancouver,
p. 10-24)

This very short introduction should suffice to understand that for
securitizers subscribing to these views, [any report
suggesting]{.underline} how or predicting that [China is **catching up**
to the U.S. can quickly **provoke** an **alarmist response** and even,
in the logic of **self-fulfilling prophecy**, create a **real
China-Threat**]{.underline} (Pan, 2004; 2013). [One of the most
characteristic features of a securitizer's discourse is the]{.underline}
"[language of **certainty** and **inevitability**]{.underline}"
(Al-Rohdan, 2007: 64). Song (2015) explains why. Given its scientific
origin relying on deductive reasoning (Song, 555), the China Threat
discourse take on characteristics of predictability. Thus, [convinced
they are guided by an **unwavering scientific logic** couched in a
**pessimistic understanding** of China's rise]{.underline} (Goldstein,
2007), more often than none, [securitizing agents' rhetoric take an
**alarmist** and **worst-case tone**]{.underline}.

Song (2015: 156-159) also explains how historical analogies can provide
the most authoritative way for print media to securitize China,
especially for those news organizations catering to an educated public
or to political elites. In international-relations circles, [**Imperial
Japan** and **Hitlerian Germany** represent]{.underline} de-facto
[historical examples used to theorize the belligerent intentions of a
rising challenger like China]{.underline} towards a global order
(Overholt, 2008). In the print media, on the other hand, scholars have
identified the Cold War as a privileged historical analogy mobilized to
construct China as a security issue. As I have explained, following the
U.S.S.R.'s collapse in 1991, communist China was depicted as a new
ideological threat to U.S. way of life. "China r\[ose\] to fill a vacuum
caused by the demise of the Soviet Union" (Jeffery, 2009: 311). Overall,
[Song's framework help identify media securitizers' **key discursive
features**:]{.underline} **[pseudo-scientific]{.underline}** predictive
[**confidence**, an **alarmist** and **pessimistic tone**, and use of
historical analogies]{.underline}. Although scholars have criticized the
short-comings of the China Threat (Al-Rodhan, 2007; Jeffery, 2009), no
researchers have asked whether [its discourse's own **catastrophic
projections** and expectations **over-securitized**]{.underline}
Washington-Beijing **[relations]{.underline}**, and thus participated in
the Threat's mediatic downfall? If that were the case, however, it would
suggest that an internal factor---the discourse's own logic---rather
than external factors (e.g., U.S. foreign-policy changes) tend to lead
to its cyclical nature. This may even explain why the China Threat and
Beijing's containment never managed to become the U.S.'s dominant way of
dealing with China's rise.

Methods

This study investigates how media coverage of China's techno-scientific
expertise has changed over time. These changes form a compelling case to
assess the structure of the China Threat cycle and the role of media
discourse as China's securitizer. As we saw earlier, after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, communist China became the new enemy driving
American foreign-policy and security concerns in the 1990s. China-Threat
proponents claim that Beijing's sustained economic development and
military modernization are a menace to U.S. national security and global
hegemony. On the other hand, over the last 20 years or so China's techno
scientific development have driven Beijing's global ascension, playing a
key role in both economic and military realms, the very same domains
that tend to worry fearful American observers of China. Therefore, the
U.S. media's coverage of China's techno-scientific expertise allows for
an examination of the China-Threat cycle and the conditions ---that is,
the trigger mechanisms---causing this cycle to escalate and decline over
time. Analysis of this reporting will allow to analyze the role media's
way of writing China itself plays in these discursive episodes
constructing Beijing's rise as a security problem for U.S. global
hegemony. For instance, Al Rodhan (2007:62) indicates that dominant U.S.
media participate in "painting an all-powerful threatening China bent on
the destruction of the United States" (see Liss 2003 for a similar
argument on media's negative China coverage).

The data from this study come from a collection of news articles from
The New York Times. This choice was specific and deliberate. I collected
articles using Lexis-Nexis Academic, the world's largest electronic
database of legal and newspaper documents. I searched for eight keywords
between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2016: 'China' or 'Chinese'
'science', 'China' or 'Chinese' 'scientist(s), 'China' or 'Chinese'
'research', 'China' or 'Chinese' 'researcher(s)', 'China' or 'Chinese'
'professor(s)', and 'China' or 'Chinese' 'technology(ies)' (for a
keywords methodology, see Ghaziani and Ventresca, 2005). To also collect
documents where two keywords might be separated by more than one word
(e.g. the development of science in a previously underdeveloped country
such as China), I used a Lexis-Nexis advanced search option to limit the
number of words between two keywords to ten, since doing so would allow
me to capture more documents while controlling for contextual relevance.

I began my sampling frame in 1996 because the mid-1990s were pivotal for
China's modernization process and for Sino-American foreign
relationships. While on the one hand Washington was committed to a
building strong economic ties with Beijing, on the other there were also
increasing tensions between the two countries (e.g., the 1996 bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade; the escalation of tension over the
Taiwan Straight). There were also concerns about China's stability
following the death in 1999 of Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's
reform; and reports of developmental problems such as wealth disparity
and systemic corruption were also reaching historic highs at this time
(Vogel, 2011).

My data-collection strategy resulted in 1,845 articles. During the
review process, I identified and eliminated articles that were
irrelevant to the topic of China's techno-scientific expertise, i.e.,
those articles that had been electronically retrieved by Lexis-Nexis
based on my keywords search but that did not actually focus on the
subject matter. This data-cleaning process reduced the dataset to 1,185
documents. I then used a simple random sampling method to reduce the
number of documents I would analyse: after sorting these documents into
chronological order (from oldest to newest), I chose every fifth
document. Given the event-based nature of media coverage (Jones, 1993),
temporal distance is important in preventing the over-sampling of
specific events: selecting every fifth news story thus provided a
balance between over- and under- sampling.

The final sample consisted of 250 documents (13.5% of the original
result) that averaged 1,179 words but ranged from 92 to 8,793 words. Of
this sample, 239 were news stories (96%), 8 were op-ed pieces (3%), and
3 were essays (1%). As for their desk distribution, 130 were from the
foreign desk (51%), 40 from the business/financial desk (16%), 25 from
the national desk (10%), 20 from the science desk (8%), and the
remainder came equally from the editorial, education, and week-in-review
sections. Nearly one-fourth (26%; 65 documents) of all the sampled news
articles appeared on the front page of The New York Times. I coded
documents using a retroductive method (Ragin 1994) which alternates
between inductive and deductive approaches (see Table 1).

\-\-\-- TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \-\-\--

Amongst the reliability procedures available, intercoder reliability is
most relevant to qualitative content-analysis research (Campbell et al.,
2013). Intercoder reliability determines if different coders would code
the same data in similar ways (Campbell et al., 2013: 2). Therefore, to
evaluate the reliability of my coding procedure I conducted an
intercoder reliability test with an independent rater. The final coding
architecture was reduced to 20 codes (see Table 1 below for final node
names). To do so, I randomly selected 10% (23 articles) of my original
sample. This inter-coder reliability test involved training an
independent coder on how to use my codebook, and having her code my
subsample to assess how similarly we coded the same data (Krippendorff,
2004; Campbell et al., 2013). This inter-coder reliability testing
helped me to ensure that the themes I identified in the data were not
idiosyncratic, especially since the second coder had a strong
quantitative background and was not a China specialist.

Inter-coder reliability test that yields a proportional agreement of
0.80 (80%) or higher is considered reliable (Krippendorff, 2004: 241).
In our case, convincing results of above 80% were obtained after the
first round of coding by the second coder. As Table 1 below shows, all
of my codes were reliable, and were thus retained for analysis. The
lowest score registered was 94.79% well over the established 80%
benchmark.

A research design centered on the coverage that one news organization
(The New York Times) gave to China's techno-scientific expertise is
limited in how fully it represents the total American mediatic
environment on that topic. On the related themes of China's rise and the
China-Threat, however, studies indicate very little differences amongst
dominant liberal media agencies such as The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and The BBC (Griffiths, 2013;
Zengjun, 2004; Liss, 2003). Both earlier and more recent media studies
indicate how The New York Times can not only set the agenda for other
news media (in US and abroad) but also help shape the views of the
Washington establishment and of U.S. foreign policies (Cohen, 1961;
Weiss, 1974; Davison, 1976; Graber, 1980; Bradley, 1984; more recently,
see Yu and Leung, 2005, for an example of how the Times shaped George W.
Bush's approach to the 2003 SARS crisis and his handling of the
situation with Chinese Premier Jiang). Coverage by The New York Times is
also more likely to entice state agencies to respond to a foreign crisis
with disaster assistance that any TV network coverage (see Drury, Olson,
and Van Belle, 2005 for a similar measure of the Times's influence). The
dominant voice in American media, balancing between performativity and
objectivity and having the longest (according to Liss \[2003\], the
first reporting of news from China came as early as 1868) and most
extensive coverage of China (as revealed by my Lexis-Nexis analysis),
The New York Times is the ideal candidate for a study of which aspects
of China's scientific rise are covered; and more importantly, how
exactly that country's techno-scientific expertise interacts with a
powerful othering discourse representing China as a threat.

China-Threat Cycles: Media Securitizer and Racist Legal Practice

My results show the presence of two China-Threat episodes in the pages
of The Times between 1996 and 2016. The first cycle occurred between
1996 and 2001, and the second between 2010 and 2016. Both rounds
displayed similar rhythms: escalation, peak, and downfall. These
findings are consistent with the idea that the coverage content and
framing of dominant U.S. print media like The New York Times capture the
very concerns and ideologies of dominant social and political elites. In
this case, these China-Threat waves in The Times coincide with two
periods of tension in the Sino-American relationship. But beyond the
journalistic reporting capturing the political zeitgeist, my findings
uncovered two significant mechanisms clarifying the inner workings of
sinophobic4 moments. The first concerns the peak phase and media
securitizer; the second, the downfall phase and racism. Results from the
first China-Threat cycle reveal how The New York Times itself played a
key role as a securitizing agent in the case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee. Namely,
beyond the event itself, the mediatic way of writing the event acted as
a powerful trigger furthering the discursive construction of China as a
security issue, a perception that was well established by the
late-1990s. My analysis shows how in both episodes, racial profiling
against ethnic Chinese-American scientists who had been falsely accused
of spying for Beijing contributed to the China-Threat downfall. I argue
these judiciary moments acted as reflexive trigger revealing how this
American over-securitization of China by powerful U.S. political and
defense actors---a stance that was intended to protect U.S.
interests---in fact ended up harming some of its own citizens:
scientists of Chinese heritage.

1996-2001 -- Early post-Cold War Anxieties: Dr. Lee's Case and Atomic
Trigger as China Threat Trigger

By the mid-1990s, the China-Threat views were circulating widely in
American political and media circles (Broomfield, 2003; Al-Rodhan,
2007). A rising Communist China was increasingly understood as a
military, ideological, and economic threat to U.S.'s national interests
and global hegemony (Yee et al. 2002). A generational perspective helps
to explain the connection between Cold War perceptions lingering even
after 1991 and the origin of the China Threat. For a significant number
of Americans who had been adults during the Cold War, the rise of
communist China was most likely to be understood in the context of what
they had learned from their country's more than four decades of
confrontation with the Soviets; it was hard to think that things would
be any different with the exponential economic rise of China
(Bloomfield, 2003). Formalized as the successor-state image theory in
international relations (Kaplan, 2005; see Jeffery, 2009 for a
systematic critique), this view can be summarized by the argument was
that "China r\[ose\] to fill a vacuum caused by the demise of the Soviet
Union and thus represents a 'successor state' to the old Soviet power"
(Jeffery, 311; for similar arguments, see Gertz, 2000; Bernstein and
Munro, 1997).

This escalation phase was apparent in The New York Times as well. The
trigger accelerating the China-Threat episode into its peak phase came
with the story of Dr. Wen Ho Lee's case. Between 1996 and 2016, no other
event was covered more times by The New York Times than this case (17
out of 250 sampled documents). On March 6, 1999, The Times broke the
details of Wen Ho Lee's case in a lengthy news story entitled Breach At
Los Alamos: A Special Report. China Stole Nuclear Secrets for Bombs, US
Aides Say.5 The scientist, a Taiwan-born naturalized American citizen
working at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was accused of having stolen
and shared bomb secrets with Beijing's spies in the 1980s. The reporting
was alarming. Its very first lines showcased The Times's securitizing
discourse: "China has made a leap in the development of nuclear weapons:
the miniaturization of its bombs. \[...\] Until recently, China's
nuclear weapon designs were a generation behind those of the United
States, largely because Beijing was unable to produce small warheads
\[...\] the backbone of a modern nuclear force."6 Information about the
atomic trigger for the hydrogen bomb, known as a "primary," was believed
to have been passed to Beijing by Dr. Lee while he was travelling to a
scientific conference in the late 1980s.

The legal case would be dismissed more than two years later in February
2001 in an embarrassing fashion for the Justice Department and the
plethora of federal agencies that had been swept up in collective
paranoia (Lee and Zia, 2003). Records indicate that the FBI "carried out
its largest computer forensic investigation ever," interviewing more
than 1,000 individuals over nine months, "scouring the globe for
evidence that Dr. Lee had leaked his secrets." 7 But they found not a
single trace linking Dr. Lee to the claimed nuclear leak. Mr. Lee was
not a spy entist, simply an ethnic Chinese scientist working at one of
the most important nuclear laboratories in the country and who might
have been in contact with Beijing's or Taiwan's spies in the 1980s.
During this time, Wen Ho Lee spent more than twelve months in a federal
prison, including nine months in solitary confinement, facing the
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison (Lee et al., 2003).8
During his detention, a former FBI agent went as far as to suggest "it
is reasonable to suppose that \[...\] "100,000 Chinese Americans \[...\]
should, hence, be suspected of serving as intelligence agents for the
People's Republic of China" (Lyman, 2000: 685). Clearly, The Times'
story had triggered an unreasonable fear that China had deeply and
systematically penetrated the country's most strategic infrastructure.

Cold-War Securitizers

In Dr. Lee's case, the aspect of the situation that triggered the
China-Threat could be what was reportedly stolen, "the design of
America's most advanced nuclear weapon,"9 the miniature W-88 war-head,
the crown jewel of U.S. nuclear power; or where it was allegedly stolen,
Los Alamos National Laboratory, the iconic U.S. Department of Energy
location where the Manhattan Project and the world's first atomic bombs
were conceived. But I argue the key element was not merely the event
itself, but as the passage above captured, The Times's own securitizing
discourse. The way the media wrote the story was a crucial moving force
in further constructing Beijing as an imminent threat. As one journalist
involved in that story later candidly noted about The New York Times's
participation in the case, "Often what mattered was who the interpreters
were, and what perspective they brought."10 Apart from the print media's
own voice, one particularly efficient group of interpreters featured in
the media discourse were Cold War securitizers embracing an offensive
realist vision of the world. The article's closing sentences indicate
how securitizing agents used "the language of certainty and
inevitability" (Al-Rodhan, 2007: 64) and Cold War imageries: "Mr.
Redmond, the C.I.A.'s former counterintelligence chief, who made his
name by unmasking the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames, says he has no doubts
about the significance \[of these\] discoveries \[concerning Wen Ho
Lee\]. As he put it, 'This is far more damaging to the national security
than Aldrich Ames.'"11 Here a well-known securitizing agent was not
merely suggesting but affirming that Dr. Lee's actions were more serious
than those of Aldrich Ames, one of the most effective moles in U.S.
intelligence history, who admitted compromising "virtually all Soviet
agents of the C.I.A. and other American and foreign services known to"
him (Weiner, Johnston, and Lewis, 2014: 134). His role as a Soviet
double agent was subsequently tied to state assassination and the deaths
of C.I.A. agents (Weiner et al., 134-35). In other words, beyond the
alleged events directly related to Dr. Lee, The Times' securitization of
the narrative, in which Beijing was repeatedly constructed as an
imminent security issue, propelled the China-Threat cycle to its peak
stage.

The offensive **[realism]{.underline}** perspective that was prevalent
among the U.S.'s military and national security establishment
(Al-Rodhan, 2007: 62; Goldstein, 2007: 639-640) [suggested]{.underline}
that [China was]{.underline} at that point [on **nuclear par** with the
U.S]{.underline}. ---also known as cross-over (Jeffery, 312; Lim, 2015:
282-83), [which]{.underline} in turn [implied]{.underline} that [Beijing
would]{.underline} eventually [take a more **aggressive stand** in the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region. The point is not simply that offensive
realism can scientifically explain these bouts of China-Threat in the
media and political circles, but rather that The Times' own
[coverage]{.underline} gave voice to and therefore [legitimized
**Cold-War securitizers**]{.underline} holding such theoretical views.
Song (2015) argues that **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations **[theories]{.underline}** (e.g., offensive
realism, power transition theory) themselves [participated in the
development of **fearful perceptions** of a rising China
in]{.underline}to the **[China-Threat discourse]{.underline}**. From
Song's perspective, [theory does more than **explain** reality: it also
**shapes** reality.]{.underline} Bourdieu (1991: 194-198) calls this
effet de théorie. As he explains, "[\[t\]heory]{.underline} itself [can
be applied to reality, by **agents**]{.underline} and organizations
[capable of imposing principles of vision and di-vision, or
of]{.underline} producing or symbolically [reinforcing their propensity
to systematically **privilege** certain aspects of reality while
**ignoring others**]{.underline}." As Goldstein (2007: 99) elegantly
explains: "With a sense of conviction matched by urgency, writing on the
subject \[[the **China-Threat**]{.underline}\] often [seeks to
demonstrate the wisdom of a particular line of reasoning
and]{.underline} then to **[offer conclusions]{.underline}** about the
challenges currently faced, [**predictions** about the trajectory we
will witness in the future]{.underline}, [and **policy recommendations**
that logically follow from the **preferred interp**]{.underline}retation
[of **China's rise**]{.underline}." For instance, on March 6, 1999,
there was no hard proof that China had stolen the nuclear secrets or
that Beijing's nuclear program had even reached that level of
development. But [The]{.underline} Times' [narrative
**promoted**]{.underline} offensive [realism's **core idea** that parity
between **Beijing's nuc**]{.underline}lear
capabilitie**[s]{.underline}** [and the U.S.'s meant]{.underline} that
[China would **display**]{.underline} increasing **[belligerent
behavior]{.underline}** with its neighbours and the U.S. Consider the
following passage from the Breach At Los Alamos piece : "while officials
question whether China will actually deploy a more advanced nuclear
force soon, they acknowledge that Beijing has made plans to do so at
some point."12 As Song explains, for offensive realist or power
transition theorists and those holding such views, ["\[t\]he threat
posed by a rising China to international security is reasoned
'**scientifically**' to be **inevitable**]{.underline}" (Song, 2015:
155). [It is thus not surprising that]{.underline} "\[[a\]ssuming the
worst is what China-Threat Theory does]{.underline}" (Al-Rodhan 2007:
57).

Can one then say The Times's report was a balanced journalistic act? To
access the impact of mediatic power on other social fields is a delicate
thing to do scholars tell us (Zhang 2010). But in the case of Dr. Lee,
however, several elements allow to see how media's own influence went
far beyond negative framing (Liss, 2003) or representing (Huang and
Leung 2005) the China-Threat. I argue the news organization acted as a
powerful media securitizer. Times and times again, March 6 piece's
[reliance on **Cold War imagery** and **worst-case**, **alarmist
scenario** suggests the]{.underline} print [media was far from
performing its role of]{.underline} journalistic [objective
reporting]{.underline}. Indeed, several elements point at the
newspaper's securitizing participation. For one, following his release
from prison, Dr. Lee successfully sued The New York Times along with
four other news agencies (Lee, 2003). A more direct supportive evidence
is a rare mea culpa published by The New York Times, "an unusual
statement assessing its coverage,"13 two days before the final court
ruling would decide the atomic scientist's legal fate in a two-part
report totaling nearly 13,000 words. The document portrays the newspaper
as a reflexive media securitizer discussing its own participation in the
late-1990s wave of China-Threat. As The Times explained,

> \[t\]he spying charges gained wide public attention on March 6, 1999
> after The Times reported \[the case of Wen Ho Lee\]. The Times's

In this revealing passage, the U.S. newspaper acknowledges its role as a
China's securitizer as a result of its 1999 accounts failing to be
impartial. But at the same time, it points out how the newspaper was
caught in crossfire between two camps within the Washington
Establishment. As the reflexive media securitizer goes on to explain,
"The Times's stories echoed and often oversimplified by politicians and
other news organizations---touched off a fierce public debate,"16 a
debate between those fearing China and those eager to engage and
integrate China within the Western global liberal order. The stakes were
high. For instance, China-Threat proponents used The Times's story to
attack the Clinton administration's position. In the aftermath of the
Wen Ho Lee's story, the White House blamed the newspaper for giving
credence to securitizing forces. "At a time when the Clinton
administration was defending a policy of increased engagement with
China, any suggestion that the White House had not moved swiftly against
a major Chinese espionage operation was politically explosive."17 As one
journalist puts it, "Republicans were eager to score points against the
White House on China."18 The Republican camp's strongest effort to
securitized China, the Cox Report, is closely linked with The Times'
reporting.

Indeed, at the time of the Breach At Los Alamos article, the Selected
Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns
with the People's Republic of China, headed by Christopher Cox, a
Republican representative from California, was finalizing its report
investigating whether since the 1980s technology or information that
would have helped Beijing's military program had been sent to China.
Upon reading The Times article and without consulting with any nuclear
experts, the committee decided to expand their report with a chapter on
China's nuclear espionage. Two months later, in May 1999, a redacted
version of the 700 page classified Cox Report was released. The Times
later called this report "the hasty product of an ideologically
supercharged selected committee \[...\] led by Cox."19

To this day, the Cox Report (Congress, 1999) remains a classic
China-Threat document. In his history of "the yellow peril," a racist
discourse on Asian nations dating back to the late 19th century, Lyman
(2000) argues that the Cox report constitutes the most important
document in its re-emergence in the late 1990s and that the China-Threat
discourse is only the most recent manifestation of the yellow peril. If
it is so, my findings indicate very clearly that The New York Times'
Breach At Los Alamos article also constitutes a key text in the intense
China-Threat episode that permeated the media as well as political and
public attention at the end of the 20th century. Given the pre-eminence
of print media in the U.S. mediatic sphere, one wonders if Dr. Lee's
case would have even broken publicly if the newspaper had not decided to
run the story.

In China, IR scholars were also quick to link the China-Threat discourse
to the yellow peril fear and the genealogy of racist western doctrine
pertaining to China (Shi, 1997; Luo, 1997; Li, 1999; Shi, 2004; Chen,
2005). My analytical focus here is not on revealing whether the U.S.
mediatic portrayal of Lee borrowed from yellow peril imageries in its
construction of China as a security threat---although Hanser (2013)
found racist footprints in major U.S. print-media coverage of scandals
involving defective/contaminated products manufactured in China. Rather,
what I am concerned with is how [racial profiling appears to have played
a role]{.underline} in Dr. Lee's case. **[Racist or not as a discourse,
the China-Threat is racist in its consequence]{.underline}**. For
instance, in 1997 when the CIA and other security-related agencies took
stock of China's sudden advance in nuclear design, some voices of reason
noted that more than a few thousand scientists and federal workers had
had access to the W-88 warhead blueprint design, so it was premature to
think the alleged theft had occurred at Los Alamos. But, once Los Alamos
was nevertheless "established" as the institutional source of the said
leak, mostly because the W-88 was originally designed there, the
suspicion quickly fell on Dr. Lee, one of the few scientists with
Chinese heritage who had had contacts with Mainland Chinese colleagues
in the 1980s.

corroborate ice core data privileges a linear geologic timescale and a
European or Western set of historical events as markers.** When
scientists, academics, and journalists use events of human history to
make assertions, often only major events of Western histories are used
as key markers of suitable evidence]{.underline}. As Alessandro
Antonello and Mark Carey argue **[in their critique of the "Human Time"
created by ice core temporal logics, mainstream narratives emerging from
ice cores choose devices such as: "This snow fell around the time Christ
was born, during the American Civil War, during the life of Plato,
during Roman lead smelting, the landing of Columbus, Chernobyl, and of
course, the Industrial Revolution]{.underline}**." 64 [The analysis done
by Antonello and Carey stem from additional moments like the display of
"1765" that opened this chapter, or the first ice core placed on public
display at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, which
remains exhibited in the Hall of Planet Earth, and another ice core
displayed at the Melbourne Aquarium in Australia.]{.underline} The pair
write, **["The human time emerging from these simple timelines evades
analysis of the political- economic- social processes and structures
that have caused climate change, or that equipped Western nations with
the technical capacity, global military support, and geopolitical (Cold
War) drive to be drilling the cores in the precise places where local
people are invisible in the ice core presentations."]{.underline}** 65
Put another way, **[the use of Western events in relation to the import
of ice core data is the reproduction of the supremacy of whiteness and
specific forms of civilization. The ice core in its layers and depth-
correlation to years counted back into time synchronizes time periods
that are being forced to intellectually touch through a lens that
privileges particular historical events.]{.underline}** In the ice core
context, [comparisons of air degradation between pre--Industrial
Revolution and contemporary atmospheres are one version of correlated
events; the intentional alignment with specific historical events of
human history is another.]{.underline} **[Certain moments of breath and
breathing by specific kinds of humans and certain politics of breath and
breathing are made more important than others.]{.underline}** Further,
[the efforts to keep ice cores frozen and intact shows investment in the
protection against the loss of some histories over others. The fixity
and privileging of a certain past then legitimates and authorizes a
certain kind of politics in the present and imaginable futures. Proxy
data also complicates ice core narratives.]{.underline} For Sörlin and
Isberg, **[the technology and practice of ice core drilling are
marginalized activities in comparison to ice core data that allowed for
the emergence of "new epistemic geographies of climate
knowledge."]{.underline}** 66 **[Within dominant usages of ice core
science, the drill, the process of extraction, and the imaginative
choices of narration are often erased. Feminist science and technology
studies scholarship has critiqued this process of elision and the
naturalization of scientific analyses as apolitical.]{.underline}** As
Max Liboiron writes, ["It is impossible to distinguish an object of
study from such tools of observation such as microscopes and sensors
that collect some data and not others."]{.underline} 67 **[All knowledge
comes from somewhere, including scientific knowledge.68 Ice core data is
processed into information using proxy data taken from a diverse range
of sociohistorical geographies of Indigenous lands the world
over.]{.underline}** [The technologies and processes employed in the
procurement of other forms of proxy data like tree rings, coral, peat
bogs, stalactites, and marine sediment used to corroborate and measure
ice core data remain unacknowledged.]{.underline} **[The need for proxy
data results from the incompleteness of one form of information on its
own. Data and its proxy data are necessarily pieced together into some
kind of whole--- this whole also often obscures or leaves out the
violence of colonialism.]{.underline}**

#### Tying authoritarianism to aggression activates America's [crusader mentality]{.underline} and stokes the [new Cold War]{.underline} with China

Affairs and Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at Texas A&M
University. (Christopher, "Preventing the China-U.S. Cold War from
Turning Hot", *The Chinese Journal of International Politics*, Vol. 13,
No. 3, doi: 10.1093/cjip/poaa012)

[When it comes to US policy toward China, **great power politics** is
**only part of the story**]{.underline}. [American policy makers are
**revisiting the First Cold War** by characterizing Sino-American
relations as a **Manichean ideological struggle** between **freedom**
and]{.underline} (communist) **[authoritarianism]{.underline}**.
**[Discourse matters]{.underline}**, [and when American
policymakers]{.underline} and foreign policy analysts [**continually
play up** the fact that China's government is communist, they do so with
a **purpose**. At least **subliminally** they seek to: recall the most
dire First Cold War depictions of the Soviet 'threat']{.underline} ('the
grim oligarchy of the Kremlin'); [**delegitimize** China's
government]{.underline} in the eyes of the American public; [and create
an **'enemy image' of China** as a bad actor in international
politics]{.underline}. In short, [they seek to **unleash America's
'crusader state' mentality**]{.underline}.154 While not---quite (or
yet)---employing the kind of overwrought, lurid language of official US
pronouncements during the First Cold War, the rhetoric emanating from
Washington about China does evoke memories of documents such as
NSC-68.155 The Trump administration says great power politics is
'defined by geopolitical rivalry between free and repressive world order
visions \...',156 which means that [for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [the Sino-American relationship is **more about
ideology** than it is about the balance of power. Lest there be any
doubt that ideology is a driving force in the United States' China
policy, the IndoPacific Strategy report declares:]{.underline}

> [Yet while the Chinese people aspire to free markets, justice, and the
> rule of law, the People's Republic of China (PRC), under the
> leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), undermines the
> international system from within by exploiting its benefits while
> simultaneously eroding the values and principles of the rules-based
> order.]{.underline}157

Similarly, Vice President Pence's October 2018 and October 2019 speeches
on China also emphasized the ideological differences between the United
States and China.158 And speaking in London in January 2020, Secretary
of State Mike [Pompeo declared that the **C**hinese **C**ommunist
**P**arty]{.underline}---not China as a great power---[is 'the **central
threat of our times**'.]{.underline}159 Speaking at The Hague,
Netherlands in June 2019, Pompeo stated that 'China wants to be the
dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its
authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices
world-wide'.160

[The signs of the **Second Cold War** are **hard to miss**]{.underline}.
In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress passed the Hong Kong Human
Rights and Democracy Act. One of the bill's sponsors, Republican Sen.
Marco Rubio (Fla.) said, 'The United States and the international
community must make clear to Chinese leaders and power brokers that
their aggression toward Hong Kong risks swift, severe and lasting
consequences',161 Rubio warned that Hong Kong is not 'simply China's
internal affair'. Gordon Chang, who comments regularly on China, has
suggested that 'contagion' from Hong Kong could spill over onto the
mainland and cause the collapse of communism.162 Beijing's policy toward
Muslim's in Xinjiang has been widely denounced in the United States.163
And Congress has passed veto-proof legislation to compel the Trump
administration to punish China for its human rights violations.164
[While geopolitics and economics **play a role** in deteriorating
Sino-American relations, the salience of **ideology** is **increasingly
apparent** on the American side.]{.underline}

The post-Cold War policy of engaging China was based on
the---erroneous--- assumption that admitting China into the WTO would
result in economic liberalization and, ultimately, political
liberalization. Or, to use Robert Zollick's phrase, China would become a
'responsible stakeholder' in the international order (with Washington
defining the meaning of responsibility).165 As the IndoPacific Strategy
Report says, 'At the turn of the 21st century, the United States
advocated for China's admission into the World Trade Organization, with
the belief that economic liberalization would bring China into a greater
partnership with the United States and the free world'.166 Instead,
according to Pence, 'China has chosen economic aggression, which in turn
emboldened its growing military', and it 'has taken a sharp U-turn
toward control and oppression of its own people'.167 Within the US
foreign policy establishment, the belief that engagement failed has
fanned a widespread sense of disillusionment with China.

The growing disenchantment with China is a result of the American
foreign policy establishment's own naivete. There never was any
realistic basis for believing China would change its economic growth
model, or its political system, in response to American expectations. US
pressure on China to adhere to American norms and values serves only to
heighten Sino-American tensions. This is not a new story. Chinese
president Jiang Zemin's October 1995 remarks to the UN Security Council
are illustrative. In that speech, Jiang observed that 'certain big
powers, often under the cover of freedom, democracy and human rights,
set out to encroach upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfere
in their internal affairs and undermine their national unity and ethnic
harmony'.168 [It is commonplace for US leaders to assert that American
values are **'universal'**]{.underline}.169 **[Obviously]{.underline}**,
**[they are not]{.underline}**, [but when the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [acts on this belief, it is going down a path
fraught with peril.]{.underline}170

[Here we see influence of '**offensive liberalism**' on American foreign
policy]{.underline}.171 At its core,
[Wilsonianism]{.underline}---[liberal internationalism
American-style]{.underline}---[holds that the world is divided into
**'good' states** (**democracies**) and **'bad' states**
(**non-democracies**). The latter are deemed **incorrigible**,
**expansive**, and **aggressive**]{.underline}. As Vice President Pence
put it when speaking about China, 'History attests \[that\] a country
that oppresses its own people rarely stops there. And Beijing also aims
to extend its reach across the wider world'.172 [There is an
**eliminationist impulse** imbedded in Wilsonianism: if 'bad' states are
**troublemakers**, **regime change** is--- ostensibly---the **path to
peace** because, so it claimed, democracies: don't fight other
democracies]{.underline}; uphold an open international economic system;
[and **respect liberal values**]{.underline} both at home and abroad.173
[This **elminationist impulse** was very much on display in US relations
with the **Soviet Union**: American intervention in the **Russian Civil
War**;]{.underline} early **[First Cold War documents]{.underline}**
such as NSC 20/4; [U.S. **'psychological warfare' efforts** in the
Baltic States and Ukraine]{.underline} during the late 1940s/early
1950s; and, of course, NSC-68.174 [American policy makers ought to have
learned from the First Cold War that an
**important**]{.underline}---[and
**perilous**]{.underline}---[**threshold is crossed** when a great power
competition is **converted** into a **titanic ideological struggle**.
The former can be **modulated with**]{.underline} adroit
**[diplomacy]{.underline}** [but the latter invariably become **zero sum

Conclusion: [Can a **Train Wreck in Sino-American Relations Be
Avoided?**]{.underline}

Two powerful forces---America's liberal ideology and power transition
dynamics---are shaping the future of Sino- American relations.
[**Liberalism** is the **most potent generator of American hubris** and
**overreaching**]{.underline}. As I argued in The Peace of Illusions,
[liberalism is America's own distinctive '**myth of
empire**]{.underline}'.175 [This is evident today in the attitudes of
the American foreign policy elite toward China. For them, it seems that
the **real** 'threat' to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is not the rise of China's military or economic power. Rather, it is
the 'threat' to **America's identity**]{.underline}---[the **asserted
universality** of its model of political and economic
development]{.underline}---[posed by a non-democratic, state capitalist
China]{.underline}.176 China's rise has fueled doubts--- seldom
acknowledged openly---about the United States' future economic prospects
and, even more fundamentally, about whether America's model of economic
and political development remains superior to China's.177 As the Eurasia
Group's Ian Bremmer and David Gordon have argued, 'China's rise and
statecapitalist model present the most significant commercial and
geopolitical challenge that the United States has faced in two decades',
and 'China's state capitalism challenges the future of democratic
capitalism'.178 Indeed, as Princeton University Professor Aaron
Friedberg argues, 'For Americans the success of a mainland \[Chinese\]
regime that blends authoritarian rule with market-driven economics is an
affront'.179

[China is a **problem** for **American foreign policy establishment**
because it **taps into their deepest fear**: that a **powerful
non-liberal state** will be able to **close off** the world]{.underline}
(or a least its key regions) [from ideological and economic penetration
by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [This fear of 'closure'
is **inextricably rooted in American liberalism** and explains why the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has such a **difficult time
coexisting** with non-liberal states]{.underline}.180 [The **last
thing** we should want]{.underline}, however, [is for the Sino-American
relationship to **degenerate** into a **new, highly ideological Second
Cold War**]{.underline}. [When power transition dynamics are added to
America's liberal ideology, Sino-American relations are **highly
combustible**]{.underline}. Security studies scholars agree that [power
transitions are **powder kegs** because of what is at stake: nothing
less than the leadership, and nature, of the international]{.underline}
(or regional) [order are up for grabs. Power transitions are about
whether the status quo can prevail over the forces of geopolitical
change]{.underline} (revisionism). When rising challengers near parity
with the declining dominant power, invariably their dissatisfaction with
the existing international order bubbles up (as it did in pre-1914
Anglo-German rivalry, to which some have compared today's Sino-America
relationship).181 After all, the existing order was constructed by the
declining dominant power during better days to privilege its own
interests.182 Rising challengers, on the other hand, want to revise the
existing order and bring it into line with what they perceive are the
new relative power realities. They seek, as Gilpin said, 'to change the
international system in order to advance their own interests'.183 If the
United States really wants to avoid a head-on collision with China, it
will have to make difficult--- even painful---adjustments and adopt a
policy that accommodates China's rise. In this sense, the United States
and China are rapidly nearing what could be called an 'E. H. Carr
Moment'.184 The Carr Moment occurs when the power relations that
underpinned---and gave birth to---the prevailing international order
have shifted in favor of the rising---revisionist---power. Carr analyzed
the international political crisis of the 1930s caused by the breakdown
of the post-World War I order enshrined in the Versailles Treaty (1919).
The Versailles system cracked, Carr argued, because of the growing gap
between the order it represented and the actual distribution of power in
Europe.

The proliferation of populist conceptions of national identity in many
countries, built on racist, xenophobic conceptions of the "other," and
the physical violence it legitimates, is a stark reminder of the power
of discourse to shape relations between "us" and "them." [We
are]{.underline} all [aware of the racist Orientalism of the high
colonial period, in which the Orient was presented as the mirror image
of the West: "we" are rational and disciplined]{.underline}, ["they" are
impulsive and emotional]{.underline}; "we" are modern and progressive,
"they" are slaves to traditional practices and routines; "[we" are
compassionate and honest, "they" are treacherous and
devious]{.underline}. [Such
**rep**]{.underline}resentation**[s]{.underline}** do not merely drive
discourse; they [**legitimate interventionist policies** in]{.underline}
[the name of **maintaining a "civilised" world order** and bringing to
heel the irrepressible forces of an irrational other]{.underline}. They
subtend the exercise of power to maintain a hierarchical relationship of
putative supremacy between the "advanced" West and the "backward" rest.
What matters for us here is that **[the structure of the
nonprolif]{.underline}**eration **[regime]{.underline}** constructed
after World War II **[was]{.underline}** also **[defined by these
binaries]{.underline}** (Abraham, 2016; Biswas, 2014; Costigliola, 1997;
Gusterson, 1999; Walker, 2000; 2012). [Such]{.underline} stark
[divisions provided a]{.underline} [dominant mode of discourse for
dealing with the nuclear ambitions of some developed and most developing
countries]{.underline}. They were not only enshrined in
[the]{.underline} 1968 [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons]{.underline} [that formally restricted nuclear
weapons]{.underline} to the five countries that already had them at the
time (the United States, the USSR, the UK, France, and the PRC)---what
India [characterised]{.underline} as [a system of "nuclear
apartheid]{.underline}." They were also drawn upon by the Washington
policymaking elite to make sense of the nuclear ambitions of some of
their Western allies, especially those that did not want to toe the
Washington line. [The lens provided by contrasting the rational and
responsible "us" with the emotive and unpredictable "them" did not
"determine" US foreign policy in nuclear matters]{.underline}. It was
rather a subterranean resource to be drawn on at times of "psychic
crisis," a shared language that helped make sense of "their" behavior
and how to deal with it. I must stress that, in criticizing US
policymakers for dismissing the nuclear aspirations of others in
demeaning terms, I am not trying to turn their language against them or
justify the acquisition of nuclear weapons by the countries they have
othered. Rather I want to suggest that **[this language]{.underline}**
actually **[provokes the prolif]{.underline}**eration that **[Washington
wants to curb]{.underline}**. The [neo-colonial power
relations]{.underline} embedded in this rhetoric [fosters a **resentful
nationalism** that can find expression in the active pursuit
of]{.underline} [**nuc**lear weapon**s** by nuclear have-nots eager to
re-establish an equilibrium with the nuclear haves]{.underline}. [It
produces the backlash described in]{.underline} the case of
[Pakistan]{.underline}. [It drove the resentment of]{.underline} Libyan
President Muammar [Ghadafi]{.underline} [when he said that]{.underline}:
"[We should be like the Chinese]{.underline}---[poor]{.underline} and
riding donkeys, [but respected]{.underline} [and possessing an atomic
bomb]{.underline}" (Maddock, 2010: 8). [It leads]{.underline} the people
of [Iran]{.underline}, [angered by Washington's "incendiary rhetoric" to
argue that "as a great civilisation with a long history, Iran has a
right to acquire a nuclear capability]{.underline}" (Takeyh, 2006: 58).
[If having **nuc**]{.underline}lear weapon[**s** is defined as a marker
of "civilisation]{.underline}" [and a condition for being "respected" by
nuclear weapons states]{.underline}, [it is but a short step for
non-nuclear weapons states to seek them]{.underline}. Late in the 1950s,
[the French]{.underline} [Defense Minister told]{.underline} Le Monde
[that "it is impossible for France to give up the bomb]{.underline}....
**[It would give up its rank of world power]{.underline}**" (Vaïsse,
2007). This "rank" went along with branding "Third World" countries that
aspired to it as inferior and untrustworthy. [The hierarchical power
relationships that are intrinsic to a nuclear-based world order will
only be dismantled when the leading nuclear weapons states]{.underline}
stand by the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear

**Meiches 19**, is assistant professor of security studies and conflict
resolution at the University of Washington--Tacoma. (Benjamin,
12-9-2019, "Wars of excess: Georges Bataille, solar economy, and the
accident in the age of precision war", Security Dialogue, Volume 51,
Issues 2-3, Pg. 275-278, accessed on 6-17-2023)

[With the rise of industrial warfare, **accidents** became a part of the
**discourse** of armed conflict. In **international relations**
literatures, this is perhaps most **apparent** in the case of
**accidental** nuclear launch given the potential for nuclear use to
cause **planetary destruction** (Sagan, 1995).]{.underline} However, the
accident reappeared as a problem with the rise of precision warfare
because of the explicit emphasis on exactness, the reduction of war's
lethality, and the deliberate, even careful, character of war. In short,
the ability to govern war precisely existed in tension with the
probability of socalled accidental deaths. Precision warfare was, by its
nature, supposed to become accident free. Patricia Owens (2003) and Maja
Zehfuss (2011) have both offered excellent analyses of the dangerous
character of this logic. As Owens (2003: 599--600) opines, 'at issue
\[in this form of warfare\] is how civilian deaths are legitimated and
under what guises this occurs'. [According to Owens, the accident
**functions** as a way of explicating and extending **martial power**
and, more specifically, of **discursively** producing an event as
**accidental**: 'the events labelled "accidents" **were not** accidents
until they had been **narrated as such**, contrary to the liberal state
(and positivist) assumption that they must **self-evidently** be
accidents' (Owens, 2003: 616). Owens and Zehfuss explain how the
**category** of the accident **enables** advocates of precision warfare
to **deny** any relationship between supposed **precise** technologies
and their **capacity** to injure and **kill**.]{.underline} [In this
way, Owens and Zehfuss also confirm the **broader observation** of Paul
Virilio (2006) that the accident **constitutes** an integral part of any
**technology** (martial or not). According to this model, the birth of a
technology is also the birth of the accident, and, consequently, any
perspective that treats the accident as derivative is engaging in a
depoliticization of the dangers of technology and speed. This process of
depoliticization guts the possibility of democratic politics in
discussions of security and war]{.underline} (Glezos, 2013). Bataille's
writings on war illuminate several additional elements of accidents and
risk-transfer war. First, critical security studies literature chiefly
approaches the accident through the lens of ideology, discourse, and
narration. Here, [the **accident** functions as a kind of **discursive
trick** that separates **legitimate** and **illegitimate** violence and,
therefore, legitimate and illegitimate modes of warfare.]{.underline}
This point is an important rejoinder to the rhetoric of risk-transfer
warfare. However, Bataille's theories focus less on discursive or
epistemological claims about the accident and more on its ontological
status. As the previous section outlined, Bataille views warfare as a
mode of expenditure that emerges from conditions of excess. For Bataille
(1985), excesses emerge from a type of 'base matter' that is not subject
to representation and can only be testified to through inner experience.
This form of excess, which cannot be fully sensed or described, is thus
ontologically contingent and cannot be known in advance. Put
differently, for Bataille, contingencies are a constitutive part of
armed conflict regardless of the terminology or discourse that surrounds
them. Industrial warfare sought to eliminate these contingencies in
order to function according to a model of rational accumulation. The
recent rise of precision, risk, and the accident as frames for
understanding contingency occurs as part of this much larger
paradigmatic shift to reframe war as a problem of utility, rationality,
and ends. [The accident constitutes only the newest method not just of
legitimizing war but also of governing and eliminating the problem of
excess.]{.underline} Since warfare involves expenditures of excess, it
is necessarily rife with contingencies and accidents. [The **accident**
thus operates as a liminal event in modern armed conflict, both as an
**epistemological invention** to legitimate **specific deaths** and
**injuries**, and as the resistance of base matter and solar economy to
human efforts at **rationalization** and **governance**.]{.underline}
These theoretical observations make several interventions into debates
about precision warfare. First, Bataille extends existing critiques of
risk-transfer warfare by both situating them as part of a broader shift
in modern warfare and establishing that the very terms of the discourse
are antithetical to the conditions of solar economy. Bataille's thought
shows how the structure of rationality in riskless war relies on the
accident as a discursive supplement in order to comprehend the excesses
that will recur in a condition of solar economy even when armed conflict
is defined by utility, rationality, and accumulation. [The accident is
not only an **ideological trick** designed to **depoliticize**, but also
an **epistemological supplement** that **insulates** the precision
paradigm from its **inability** to grapple with excess. This provides an
alternative way of interpreting the concern for the accident since,
following Bataille, precision legitimates modern warfare by seeking to
eliminate the excesses that have continually reappeared in spite of the
broader transformation of war into a rational exercise.]{.underline}
Precision and the language of the accident constitute only the latest
effort to govern the excessive character of war. Second, this framing
also illustrates why accidents often receive unprecedented attention in
the context of modern armed conflict. Indeed, while critiques such as
those of Owens and Zehfuss reveal how the accident legitimates liberal
war, what might be called the affective dimensions of the accident
receives comparatively little scrutiny (Bataille, 1991a: 203). Here,
Bataille's work extends existing critiques of precision war by shedding
light on the formation of subjectivity in relation to the accident.
Recall that, for Bataille, the experience of sovereignty develops in
response to chance, the anguish of death, and expenditure without
reserve. Bataille further contends that human desires are constituted by
an ambivalent relationship to excess, transgression, and sovereign
experience. On the one hand, humans seek to conserve their life against
excess and, on the other hand, human societies emerge out of the
excesses of solar economy. Bataille (1991a: 243) posits that this
ambivalence generates an attachment to the possibility 'always
unexpected, \[of being\] relieved of the heaviness that the world of
utility imposes on us, of the tasks in which the world of objects mires
us down'. For Bataille, [the accident, as a form of contingency, reveals
a potential type of sovereign experience. The existence of this
possibility helps to alleviate the sorrow and futility of a world
defined by utility. Accidents function according to the model of the
miracle, the unanticipated, the unpredictable, or the impossible, which
nonetheless occurs]{.underline} (Bataille, 1991a: 242). Following
Bataille's reading, [the accident produces two reactions to sovereign
experience in modern warfare. On the one hand, the exposure to the
anguish of death **incites** the need to **control**, **manage**, and
**govern** accidents, a process that has been well documented by
critical security studies scholars (Bousquet, 2018; Campbell, 1998;
Rasmussen, 2006). On the other hand is the possibility that accidents
inspire **affective attachments** and fascinations as a form of exposure
to sovereign experience. Put differently, accidents spark a form of
excitement -- either in the midst of warfare or in **fantasies of war**
-- that has received comparatively little attention. The accident
becomes a site of desire because it ensures that warfare remains
**contingent**, implicitly resisting efforts to govern, rationalize, or
form, in Bataille's words, 'dull war'.]{.underline} This perspective
provides a model to explain why the fantasies, imaginaries, and even
experiences of martial accidents remain a point of intrigue, thrill, and
draw for modern subjectivities. Within the accident is the budding
potential of sovereign experience. Accidents thus support two
complementary forms of subjectivity. [The first responds to the
inevitability of accident as a means of securitizing and governing
contingency, while the second embraces the accident as a sovereign or
limit-experience that breaks with the overt rationalization of war and
social life. This point has significant implications for resisting or
contesting securitization regimes.]{.underline} In particular, if
Bataille's insight about the lure of sovereign experience is correct,
then classical strategies of critique, delegitimization, and demasking
power relations in precision warfare, and other contexts, are
problematic strategies because they do not confront the underlying drive
to embrace warfare's contingencies as moments of sovereign experience.
For Bataille, this desire for sovereign experience intensifies the need
to transgress, to explore prohibited zones and probe limits.
Consequently, delegitimizing the accident, emphasizing the transgressive
character of violence (or other parallel acts), paradoxically
strengthens the affective attachment to warfare by reinforcing the
notion that war holds out the possibility of sovereign experience.
Contesting security discourse on these lines would thus do little to
engage the frame of the accident because it does not support new modes
of expenditure, but simply re-emphasizes the transgressive character of
specific practices of securitization and violence. In this way,
Bataille's work shows the limits of existing critical studies of the
accident. To illustrate this point, claims about accidents involve not
only political questions about the meaning or significance of specific
injuries, but also issues of equipment malfunction, logistical
breakdowns, and encounters with surrounding ecology. Many of these
dimensions of the accident, as sites of excess and contingency, lead to
an enormous proliferation of new aesthetics, fantasies, and forms of
securitization in modern warfare. To briefly examine a single example, a
growing literature assesses the potential for 'birdstrike', collision
between aircraft and birds, as a threat to military readiness and
security (Richardson and West, 2000). In the birdstrike literature, a
multiplicity of different bird species appear as a new type of security
threat because of their possible interference with the mechanical
operation of airplanes or other airlift operations. Birdstrikes are
exceedingly rare events, which number in the dozens despite thousands of
airlift operations since the invention of flight. Nonetheless,
significant attention, monetary investment, major proposals to redesign
airports, and even plans to disrupt the ecological habitats of bird
species have all been framed as questions of security and military
necessity (Heims, 2011; Kitowski, 2011; Zakrajsek and Bissonette, 2005).
Accidents like birdstrikes exist far afield from the typical concern of
critical security analysis, yet the writing on this subject reflects
Bataille's point since this literature treats the threat of the
birdstrike as an event verging on the miraculous. As Bataille argues,
the transformation of war into a practice of accumulation generates new
excesses and expenditures -- in this context, the contingent encounter
between plane and bird. A martial paradigm defined by accumulation and
rationality views these excesses and expenditures (the needless loss of
a plane) as a threat to security. Hence, even statistically infrequent
birdstrikes constitute an interruption of the dynamics of accumulation.
These events attract incredible attention because they involve
contingency and the possibility of sovereign experience and,
accordingly, become the subject of intense, affective investment. The
vivid fear for multiple bird species and the consistent concern for
aircraft malfunction reveal a social imaginary drawn to the potential
for excesses and contingencies no matter the form and no matter how
statistically insignificant. Here, the birds become the object of a
certain kind of martial horror. Bataille predicts exactly this shift at
the level of desire and imaginary and goes so far as to suggest that,
for moderns living under a paradigm of utility, only the 'imagination
has sovereign moments available to it' (Bataille 1991a: 256).
[Bataille's work points to these more liminal **accidents** as key
places where excesses invite speculation about the potential for
sovereign experience and, at the same time, incite **new practices** of
securitization.]{.underline} In this way, the birds, as a partially
aerial ecosystem, become a new source not just of anguish and threat,
but also of sovereign experience, a new target in the expansion of armed
conflict to new ecologies, and a relief from the onerous character of
modern social life. While birdstrikes represents only a single case,
several studies have highlighted the importance of transgressive and
liminal roles in contemporary warfare, such as crowdfunding as a new
mode of martial organization or the insurgent potential of improvised
explosive devices (Grove, 2016, 2019). These examples also reflect
Bataille's insights about how expenditure, excess, and the possibility
of sovereign experience animate and shift practices of mobilization and
violence in contemporary armed conflict. In a similar way, Bataille
shows how the accident (along with other forms of contingency) is not
anathema to risk-transfer warfare, but instead functions as a
supplement, a moment of transgression amidst the overt rationalization
of warfare. Modern discourses on precision rest on a form of knowledge
that precludes Bataille's sovereignty: 'knowledge is never sovereign, to
be sovereignty would have to occur in a moment. But the moment remains
outside, short of or beyond, all knowledge. . .. \[I\]n short, we know
nothing about what ultimately concerns us, what is supremely important
to us' (Bataille, 1991a: 202--203, emphasis in original). The paradigms
of risk-transfer warfare, of the minimization of the accident, and of
securitization more generally are not capable of thoughtfully generating
new forms of expenditure. They derive, for Bataille, from a fearful
response to finitude and solar economy: 'we try to escape from this
elementary horror, but, in the darkness and dead silence, it maintains
the unpredictable and elusive movement of everything we have not been
able to reduce to the reassuring order, a movement to which we know we
shall later succumb' (Bataille, 1991a: 217), a paradigm that incites not
only risk transfer warfare but arguably the broader pursuit of security.
[As a consequence, **securitized subjectivities** seek opportunities for
expenditure in transgressions such as the **accident**. These desires,
in turn, transform the structure of contemporary
**warfare**.]{.underline}

Racialised politics of (in)security in Western IR

[Mainstream]{.underline} Western [security thinking is predicated on a
self-gratifying **imaginative geography**: the world is
divided]{.underline} roughly [into]{.underline} **[two]{.underline}**
contrasting [**zones**, one marked by **community**, **order**, and
**security** and the other by **disorder**]{.underline}, insecurity,
[and **threat**]{.underline}. [These imagined binaries are]{.underline}
both **[underpinned by]{.underline}** and emblematic of [a]{.underline}
thinly disguised **[Orientalist]{.underline}**, Eurocentric,
[and]{.underline} ultimately [**racist** idea, which equates the former
zone]{.underline} more or less [with whites and the West, and the latter
with non-whites]{.underline} (Barkawi and Laffey 2006; Howell and
Richter-Montpetit 2019). The idea, often passed off as fact (through the
Western-dominated subfield of security studies), has been constitutive
of the highly racialised realities in international relations (Bell
2013; Carrozza, Danewid, and Pauls 2017; Ling 2017; Howell and
Richter-Montpetit 2020).

Although by no means unique to the West, [racism is a **key source
code** of mainstream Western theory and]{.underline} practice of
**[security]{.underline}**. [Security presupposes a
subject]{.underline}, namely, what or [who needs security or should feel
secure]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, in turn, [implies]{.underline}
what or [whom is to be secured]{.underline} from or
[against]{.underline}. Central to security studies, therefore, is an
implicit ontological bifurcation between the subject of security and its
threat. And the [security]{.underline}/threat [boundaries
are]{.underline} often [drawn along a 'colour line']{.underline}
(Anievas, Manchanda, and Shilliam 2015).

[The racially-mediated binaries in security thinking and practice are
enabled above all by **an epistemic hierarchy**]{.underline}, which
insists on 'the inherent superiority of one's culture over all others'
(Le Melle 2009, 77). Indeed, [racism is first and foremost **epistemic
racism**]{.underline}, which is '[the **foundational form** ...of
racism]{.underline}' (Grosfoguel 2010, 29). [The West's
self-representation as the]{.underline} quintessential modern
[**knowing** subject, who has the **rational capacity** to **know** the
**objective world**]{.underline} (Pan 2012), [is **epistemic racism par
excellence**]{.underline}. Since '\[k\]nowing is then linked to the
possibility of control of the known' (Walker 1988, 51), [the knowing
Western subject can enjoy certainty, **dominance**, and security, hence
the self-image as a zone of security. The West's **epistemic
certainty**]{.underline} thus [helps **lay the groundwork** for its
sense]{.underline} [of]{.underline} moral, political, economic,
civilisational, and geostrategic **[superiority]{.underline}**
[vis-à-vis other]{.underline} races and [peoples]{.underline}, [whose
'epistemic inadequacy' makes them **irrational**]{.underline}, ignorant,
uncivilised, [and **ontologically threatening**]{.underline} (even if
occasionally blissfully innocent and/or exotically attractive).

[Threats from 'zones of insecurity' have **take**n **many
forms**]{.underline}: tribalism, terrorism, crime, disease,
overpopulation, unregulated migration, **[espionage]{.underline}**,
[unfair **trade**]{.underline} practice, anarchical,
**[illiberal]{.underline}** power **[politics]{.underline}**, or some
combinations of the above (Kaplan 1994; Huntington 1996). Intellectually
sophisticated and racially agnostic as they are, many
([Western]{.underline}) [security concepts]{.underline} and approaches
[are in effect about]{.underline} methodologies of
**[eliminating]{.underline}**, minimising, [or **containing**
the]{.underline} (largely non-Western) **['zone of
insecurity']{.underline}**, whether [through]{.underline} democracy
promotion, **[norm diffusion]{.underline}**, free trade, transnational
activism, emancipatory intervention **[and]{.underline}** developmental
assistance, or by ways of alliance building and expansion, [forward
defence]{.underline}, military **[deterrence]{.underline}**,
**[containment]{.underline}**, power balancing, and border control.

Of course, boundaries of zones of (in)security can change. But redrawing
such boundaries is again often the prerogative of scholars who
self-identify with the 'zone of security'. [They routinely play a
crucial cartographer's role in **mapping** and re-mapping zones of
(in)security]{.underline} (Huntington's civilisational map and the
'Indo-Pacific' come to mind).2 [Their dominance in the **process of
knowledge production**]{.underline} about (in)security and about IR more
broadly [exposes and]{.underline}, indeed, often [solidifies a **colour
line** in academia that mirrors the **racialised realities of
IR**]{.underline} (see also Henry, and Haastrup and Hagen in this
Issue). Scholars of colour and/or from the South are at best treated as
area specialists, a lowly ranked niche in the scholarly epistemic
hierarchy, thus perpetuating the epistemic status quo that has helped
produce the racially-mediated binaries in security thinking and practice
in the first place.

#### The 1AC superimposes Western geopolitics onto the Arctic, which marginalizes indigenous knowledges

**Körber** et al **17**, PhD, Scandinavian Studies, Humboldt-Universitat
zu Berlin, Germany (Lill-Ann, Scott MacKenzie, and Anna Westerstahl
Stenport, "Introduction: Arctic Modernities, Environmental Politics, and
the Era of the Anthropocene," in *Arctic Environmental Modernities*,
Palgrave Macmillan)

[Even in twenty-first-century environmental humanities, Indigenous and
local knowledge, with all its cultural, historical, and technological
rich- ness, is often marginalized: the strategic and ideological goals
of **Western modernity** and "progress" remain **superimposed** onto
**discourses** and prac- tices **of the Arctic**]{.underline}. And while
the popularity of Arctic studies is increasing, and an increasing number
of Indigenous and local scholars shape the field, it was outsider
perspectives that dominated research during the twentieth century (for a
salient critique of this form of intellectual colonialism, see Tuhiwai
Smith 1999). A survey of scholarly articles, published in
**[Arctic]{.underline}**, a leading multidisciplinary journal, indeed
showed that **[scholarship]{.underline}** about the Arctic [reflected
mostly "'southern interests,' (Harrison and Hodgson 1987: 330) for one
example, non-renewable resources, militarism and
sovereignty"]{.underline} (Keskitalo 2009: 30). This is **[not to
argue]{.underline}** in any way that [one form of "Indigenous knowledge"
can simply stand in for Western modernity; the question of locality, as
noted above,]{.underline} is central. For instance, Indigenous
scholarship looks very different in Sápmi and in Nunavut, and, of
course, varies within these locations as well. Rauna Kuokkanen shows the
significance of Sámi revitalization and political mobilization as evolv-
ing in very close connection with assumptions of the Nordic welfare
state, including its forms of parliamentary representation, emphasis on
consensus culture, and long-term strategies of subsuming political
struggle for gen- der equality as a subset of welfare state ideology and
politics (Kuokkonen 2011). In Sápmi, there is a long history of
emphasizing the significance of language policies and cultural
revitalization, but as of yet no coher- ent strategy for independence or
self-governance (e.g., Kuokkanen 2009). In Sápmi, conflicts regularly
arise about ownership of the land, raising questions as to when national
or international law applies. The [ILO-169 convention, regulating the
protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples, has, of the four nation
states with a Sámi population, so far only been rati- fied by Norway (of
the other Arctic states with Indigenous populations, it has been
ratified by Denmark, but not by Canada, Russia, or the USA). In Sweden
and Finland the Sámi are classified as a minority language group, not as
Indigenous populations. Russia's stance has been, for a long time, to
disregard any status of Sámi as an Indigenous population, just as the
suppression of Northern ethnic minorities has been consistently harsh
for centuries]{.underline} (Slezkine 1994). [Recently, Vladimir Putin
sought to suspend self-representation efforts through the Arctic Council
when the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North was
forcefully dissolved by state decree in 2012, and then re-opened with a
more government- friendly leadership.]{.underline}

Yet another **[aspect deeply intertwined]{.underline}** with both
**[knowledge]{.underline}** [and **political territory**]{.underline}
[is the question of land use and **resource extraction**]{.underline}.
In [Greenland, the Self-Rule Act, implemented in 2009, states that the
government of Greenland, Naalakkersuisut, has control of domestic
affairs, including the sovereignty over natural resources, while Denmark
retains control of foreign affairs and defense.]{.underline} As a point
of comparison, [contemporary discourse in Greenland emphasizes
Greenlanders neither as Inuit nor as Danish subjects, partly because to
be an Indigenous subject is to forego aspirations of statehood in
accordance with stipula- tions]{.underline} in the ILO-169 convention.
Greenland, as scholars such as Kirsten Thisted forcefully argue, is
indeed a globalized, urbanized society where especially the younger
generation is quite interested in forego- ing talk about whether the
current relationship to Denmark is colo- nial or post-colonial (Thisted
2013; see also Körber and Volquardsen 2014) in order to affirm a public
identity, or an imagined community, that emulates expressions of
national identity. Inuit of North Eastern Canada have achieved the right
to self-government as an Indigenous population in the Nunavut territory
(though the Inuit of Northern Québec, Labrador, and the Northwest
Territories have not, nor have the approximately 15,000 Inuit who live
in southern Canada), which, in the context of the long history of
Canadian political discourse about the "Arctic Frontier," offers yet
another version of politically, discursively, and negotiated Arctic
Indigeneity and self-governance (for a help- ful comparative perspective
on Greenland-Nunavut self-governance movements, see Loukacheva 2007).
Sherrill E. Grace (2007), more- over, argues that Canada's insistence on
the "North" for formulating a national ideology is unique; no other
country uses "North" as a badge of honor. Yet the Canadian government
have other badges that are not nearly as honorable. Canada's "Truth and
Reconciliation Report," which contained an Inuit sub-committee, was
released in 2015, and the recommendations have begun, after years of
neglect, to be taken on board by the government.

[These examples demonstrate that the questions of territory and sover-
eignty so central to the concept of modernity also lie at the heart of
the contested modes of politics and representation in the Arctic.
Concepts of sovereignty clearly have to be expanded beyond the 1648
"Westphalian model" of territorial nation states to include other actors
and agents, as scholars of European, Nordic, Canadian, and postcolonial
political sci- ence have argued]{.underline} (Adler-Nissen and Gad 2013;
Romaniuk 2013; Shadian 2014; Watt-Cloutier 2015).

Even as this debate became increasingly heated---Nordhaus at one point
accused Stern of "\[taking\] the lofty vantage point of the world social
planner, perhaps stoking the dying embers of the British Empire, in
determining the way the world should combat the dangers of global
warming"---Nordhaus applauded Stern's "\[selection of\] climate change
policies with an eye to balancing economic priorities with environmen-
tal dangers."16 [Conceptually, at least, the existential risk of
longtermism is not so far away from this quantified approach to the
commensuration of economic values with climate risks, and yet the former
seems radical while the latter seems relatively banal. From both of
these perspectives, the future is viewed through the **epistemological
lens of quantifiable risks and derivable discount rates**, populated by
statistical lives]{.underline}. [The policy implications of this
**should not be understated**]{.underline}. At one end of the spectrum,
[there are those who argue that our current happiness matters most and
that we should not make too many sacrifices today to help people in the
future; at the other end of the spectrum, there are those who argue that
no cost is too high to avoid existential risks, leading to a
characterization of events like the **Spanish flu** and the
**Holocaust** (and presumably the ongoing **COVID-19** pandemic) as
"**scarcely registering**" as **existential catastrophes.**]{.underline}

[In the anthropologist Ann Laura Stoler's work on the politics of co-
lonial archives, she identifies what she calls the vernacular
"**practicing epistemologies**" of powerful actors---"what they imagined
they could know and more importantly what epistemic habits they
developed to know it]{.underline}."17 From effective altruists like
Stephen to the data analysts, ESG advisers, and social impact
consultants we met in earlier chapters, the practicing epistemology of
sustainability professionals is relatively straightforward. [They
imagine that they can know the impacts of their various sustainability
projects in a way that allows these impacts to be compared with the
costs of these projects' implementation, whether it is a project geared
toward ending world hunger, mitigating the spread of HIV, reducing child
slavery, or promoting private-sector innovation in green technology.
Sustainability professionals want their interventions to be rational and
based on reason, for the positive impacts of these in- terventions to be
maximized relative to their investments, for the costs of sustainability
to be offset by its benefits.]{.underline} Their [practicing epistemol-
ogy presupposes that costs and benefits are **comparable and thus com-
mensurable** and that a common metric exists or can at least be
derived]{.underline}. The [epistemic habits they develop to know whether
an intervention or an investment is having the desired impacts are
equally straightforward: they develop and refine the definitions of
various social and environ- mental indicators]{.underline}, and they
amass a huge amount of data about those indicators.

**[Particular epistemologies]{.underline}**---that is, particular ways
of producing knowledge and particular ways of determining what counts as
knowl- edge in the first place---**[structure social reality and are
thus inseparable from ontology and ethics]{.underline}**.18 This
interrelatedness is fundamental to the notion of "[Indigenous
epistemology," which "assumes all epistemologi- cal systems to be
socially constructed and (in)formed through sociopo- litical, economic,
and historical context and processes."19 Recognizing the entanglements
of being, doing, and knowing is crucial to an ethics of worlding that
accounts for how various practices matter from per- spectives beyond the
myopic view of the market and the people whose power it obscures. If the
reality is that for-profit companies, "by their very nature," are
unsustainable and that the corporate form is inherently ecocidal, then
an **approach to sustainability that is grounded in produc- ing
quantitative data about impacts so the market can manage them is not
only a fool's errand but also deeply and irredeemably
unethical.**]{.underline}20

Reflecting on Indigenous practices of pyro-[regeneration, in which
controlled burns clear undergrowth and allow new plants and animals to
flourish, the archaeologist Paulette Steeves coined the term "pyro-
epistemology" to describe an important facet of critical Indigenous
scholarship: "A practice of Pyro-epistemology through the ceremony of
Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing is one **which cleanses the
academic landscape of discussions that misinform worldviews and fuel
misunderstanding and racism**. Such literary renewal clears the way for
**new discussions and intellectual growth in academic fields of thought
and centers of knowledge production**]{.underline}."21 Steeves's focus
on clearing the way for new discussions in centers of knowledge
production is relevant to the way sustainability professionals, through
the enforcement of their increasingly hegemonic practicing
epistemologies, reinforce enduring forms of oppression even as they
attempt to improve the lives of others. [Tracing the relationship
between the practicing epistemology of sustain- ability professionals
and the kind of future we might expect to emerge if that epistemology
remains dominant demonstrates the stakes of such a pyro-epistemology.
The politics of knowledge extend far beyond stilted academic
practitioner debates about what counts as evidence of sustainable; in
dismantling the practicing epistemology of neoliberal sustainability, we
come a step closer to what David Gegeo and Karen Watson-Gegeo call
"dehegemonization" and **rejecting** the **normalization of elite
visions of the future**]{.underline}.22

### Extinction Outweighs\-\--Defense\-\--2NC

#### 1. Calculating disasters as infinite makes it [impossible]{.underline} to accurately resolve any threat. 

**Bartha 24**, Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy,
University of British Columbia, Vancouver (Paul. \"23 Pascal's Wager and
the Precautionary Principle\". *Ontology of Divinity*, edited by

10.1515/9783111332536-026. Accessed: 7/18/24)

According to Munthe (2019), [given that the basic premise of the
precautionary principle is the avoidance of catastrophic harms, \...
there seems to be no rationally justifiable end to the amount of
resources and time that we should spend on trying to clarify an
existential risk further\... Each such risk, therefore, appears as a
'black hole]{.underline}' that, by the awesome normative power of the
mere ultimateness of the harm it threatens us with, **[sucks into its
void all other things that might have been mobilized for the pursuit of
the good in human decision-making]{.underline}**. (Munthe, 2019, p. 51)
As Munthe frames it, the black hole challenge involves a nightmare of
**[ceaseless dithering about disaster scenarios]{.underline}**: [the
threat of ultimate harms "suck\[s\] all available resources into endless
endeavors to clarify **ridiculous eventualities** of **horrific
things**]{.underline}" (Munthe, 2019, p. 58). I construe the problem
more broadly: [PP seems to entail that 100% of our time, money and
energy should be devoted to the prevention of catastrophe. As an
instance of the black hole challenge, consider NASA Budget, adapted from
Steel and Bartha (2022). Suppose that NASA has to decide how much of its
budget to devote to preventing a catastrophic asteroid impact with Earth
and how much to other valuable missions]{.underline} (space exploration,
the Webb telescope, etc.). [Given NASA's ability to reduce the
existential threat of an asteroid collision, PP appears to recommend
that the entire budget be spent on asteroid tracking, developing and
testing methods of asteroid deflection, and so forth. This absurd
recommendation is analogous to Tabarrok's fanaticism objection to
Pascal's Wager]{.underline}. 17

#### 2. It also breaks down: if I asserted the plan also CAUSED extinction, there would be no possible action to take!

**Bartha 24**, Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy,
University of British Columbia, Vancouver (Paul. \"23 Pascal's Wager and
the Precautionary Principle\". *Ontology of Divinity*, edited by

[Several authors have alleged that the precautionary principle is unable
to handle situations where there is more than one potential catastrophe.
They explicitly draw parallels to the many-gods objection, and as with
that objection, their criticisms take different forms.]{.underline}

The first is a charge of incoherence: [PP makes contradictory demands.
For example, Sunstein (2005) considers a version of PP that triggers
precautionary measures if there is any chance of catastrophic harm. But
if the precautionary measures themselves might have catastrophic
consequences, PP both recommends and prohibits them. In a similar
spirit, Manson (2002) imagines a scenario in which there is a tiny
probability that drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions might lead to
worldwide economic depression, political instability, war, and a
disastrous nuclear holocaust. It **appears that PP both recommends and
prohibits the drastic emissions cuts**]{.underline}. 15 Here, Manson
explicitly notes the parallel with Pascal's Wager and the many-gods
objection. Sandin (2009, p. 92) describes a similar dilemma:

Suppose someone argues, with reference to the precautionary principle,
that protocell research should be stopped because such research might,
through some possible but extremely unlikely causal chain result in the
end of all natural life on Earth\... It might then be countered that
there is an alternative scenario, also possible, in which not proceeding
with protocell research leads to the extinction of all natural life on
Earth\... \[Given that both scenarios are possible\] we should,
according to the precautionary principle, both proceed and not proceed
with protocell research.

[The second form of the many-disasters objection is a charge of
paralysis. Sandin (2009) points out that PP can be formulated as the
recommendation to "**abstain from all actions that might have harmful
consequences.**" In this case there is no incoherence, but "we are
**offered no action guidance** at all."]{.underline}

Finally, [the third form is a charge of non-discrimination.]{.underline}
Here, we modify an example due to Colyvan et al. (2010), Mangrove
Forest, to suggest that [PP fails to discriminate properly between two
remedies that might be adopted to prevent environmental disaster.
Suppose that both the destruction (D) of a mangrove forest and the
destruction (H) of half the forest are considered catastrophic outcomes.
Act A will destroy half the forest, while act B will destroy the entire
forest. It seems clear that B is worse than A, but PP provides no basis
for discrimination. For if we assign utility --∞ to both D and H, then
both A and B have negative infinite utility (Table 5), so the two
options are **equally bad.** This is **plainly wrong!**]{.underline}

Second, the [**fundamental opposition** between the aforementioned
discourses should compel practitioners to undertake a more **profound
rethinking** of the **environment**]{.underline}; in other words, [one
cannot divorce thinking about the environment from the broader ethical
environmental frameworks in which this knowledge is produced. TEK and a

this alterlife, in which we are all caught up in the differently
experienced melt, the generative capacity of emptiness can act as a
reframing. I will not rush to narratively fill emptiness, to beautify it
toward progress.]{.underline} **[Erica Violet Lee writes, "A wasteland

wastelands by the ones who have no relation, no history to lands deemed
empty, wasted, and/or destroyed. I'm unconvinced by the need to prove
otherwise, to fill emptiness. In looking closely at a snowflake, the
building material of ice, each snow crystal is shaped by its corners,
openings, bubbles, and empty spaces. **These characteristics are what
fundamentally constitute the productive and capacious nature of ice,
both scientifically and aesthetically. Empty spaces allow for matter to
temporarily cohere. Empty spaces allow for the unknotting of the bind

every knowable thing in every knowable aspect about our research
subject, object, place, and interlocutors, to name and intellectualize a
feeling into data before we've let it wash over and saturate
us**]{.underline}. [**In emptiness there is pause. There is no
requirement for full, complete interpretation or translation. In
emptiness, critical co-theorizing, productive touching, and
contamination among us can occur without a final answer,** magnifying
glass, dictation, a recording device, a funded grant, a performance of
complete mastery. In emptiness, there is also what I offer as careful
guessing or careful guesswork.]{.underline} **[Building from critical
Indigenous studies, guesswork honors emptiness, respecting the refusals,
the breaks, the pauses, the doors shut and not inspecting the windows.
Careful guesswork also urges a form of study that is not extractive,
that is desire- based]{.underline}**,18 **[that does not seek to build
new theories that displace Indigenous theorizing.]{.underline}**19
[Careful guessing is critically attentive to the ongoing dimensions and
histories of power relations that shape the responses to the question at
hand and the forms of questioning that seem possible and
impossible.]{.underline} [Who and what shape my questions that seem
naturalized to me? Careful guess-work upholds that I can guess to the
best of my knowledge, with accountability to place and peoples,20 and
with an ethic of anti- coloniality and decoloniality when
possible.]{.underline}21 **[Careful guesswork insists that objectivity
is an impossibility, that researchers are narrators who craft
compromised stories. We are guessing always, and our guesses must work
to be consensual among all forms of our interlocutors, relations, and
the careful guessing that has emerged before us.]{.underline}**2 [In my
own guesswork, I am studying, researching, and guessing about Indigenous
ice geographies, the spatial materiality of ice, and the experiences
that ice might be having. I cannot know with the normative performance
of certainty that is expected of a researcher. I can read, listen, and
participate thoroughly, widely, experientially and make careful
guesses.]{.underline} [The work of careful guessing in relation to
nonhuman kin, entities, and collaborators is not to anthropomorphize.
Guesswork upholds that ice geographies cannot and will not be enclosed
by the stretches of human intellectualizing or imagination. Instead, I
can try to the best of my careful, critical abilities to tell my
compromised reflections of the interlocking politics, stories,
histories, and affective embodiments of and with ice geographies that
existed before I had ideas about them.]{.underline} **[As Sai­diya
Hartman writes of her concept critical fabulation, there is a
political-ethical- moral container we make as our research protocols. It
is our responsibility to write within and against the intellectual
infrastructures that invent the limits of what and who counts and
matters.]{.underline}**23 In careful guesswork, [emptiness is a
political reality of the haunting of colonial theft,24 a choice or a
refusal,25 and the material embodiment of space and the infrastructure
of matter to contain emptiness. Emptiness does not equate to
meaninglessness or a void to be filled with meaning. For even if this
mischaracterization were true, that ice geographies are empty, would
they be less worthy of my time, attention, and care?]{.underline}

**[If colonial insistence on the unmoving category of the terrestrial
might undermine water and ice in some ways, water and ice can also help
break those categories.]{.underline}** As Philip Steinberg and Kimberley
Peters write, "**[State ontology . . . is profoundly terrestrial. . . .
The modern state system is premised on a distinction between solid land
and liquid sea . . . ice confuses and complicates acts of territorial
and sovereign control. . . . The three- dimensional extent of the sea .
. . makes observation and knowledge, and therefore geopolitical control,
problematic]{.underline}**." 28 [Ice is land, ice is not land. Non-
Native juridical systems and cartography along with other property
regimes built to dispossess Native land have never been capacious enough
to represent the full contours of Indigenous relationships.29 Due to the
hyperattention land is given, there is little legal recourse with which
to strategically]{.underline} claim [other forms as relations and
beings. There have been several outstanding examples against the trend,
such as the Yurok Tribe granting legal personhood to the Klamath River
in 2019; Mutehekau Shipu (Magpie River) was declared a legal person by
the Innu Council of Ekuanitshit; and the residents in Orange County,
Florida, voted to grant rights to the Econlockhatchee and Wekiva Rivers.
Outside of the United States and Canada, Native polities and communities
are using legal realms in creative ways to claim and protect waters.
**In Aotearoa in 2017, the Whanganui River was granted legal personhood
status following the efforts and mobilizing of Māori. In the following
pages, I'm concerned with how such relations and beings have been taken
up centrally across Black Diaspora studies and Oceania studies.** I co-
theorize with intellectuals and experts whose conceptualizations and
labors, in relation to their communities, are meant to somehow be
separate from ruminations on land and ice. In my ask to build alliance,
I wish to recognize that these formulations to water, land, and ice are
distinct and varied but certainly not unrelated]{.underline}. **[Land,
water, and ice thought together insist that to know land we must also
know water--- not a new formulation to many Black and Indigenous
thinkers across time--- and to know land and water we must also know
ice.]{.underline}** [Scholars writing about water and ocean as analytic,
either explicitly or inexplicitly, often upend the centrality of the
European continent. **In recent iterations, the turn away from the
continental has also been a turn away from land and terrestrial as
center. In much of Indigenous law, water relations are central to the
functioning of community and not in ways that divide water from
land.**]{.underline} [Enactments of water dispossession and theft
demonstrate its fundamental nature similarly to land. The privatization
of water rights, pollution of clean drinking water sources and other
forms of environmental contamination, and the damming of rivers by
colonial infrastructure, as well as attendant actions such as water
protection that emerge as a result, illustrate the crucial role of water
and access to water.30 Not unlike how land is regulated through settler
law, water has been legislated as a necessity, particularly in arid
regions needed for agriculture, and through the uneven protection of
tribal water rights. **Water cannot be overdetermined by colonial
bindings alone: the waters that run through Indigenous lands are the
arteries that feed and bind humans and their kin.31 As Melanie K. Yazzie
and Cutcha Risling Baldy write of water across Indigenous decolonization
stru**ggles, "Water is seen as an ancestor and as a relative with agency
within this network of life, one who deserves]{.underline} [respect,
care, and protection."]{.underline} 32 [These forms of relation are
common across Indigenous communities and in the same breath take
distinct]{.underline}, emplaced forms. In Natalie Diaz's poem "The First
Water Is the Body," she writes of a particular historical and ongoing
emplaced- ness with river:

**[The Colorado River is the most endangered river in the
United]{.underline}**

**[States--- also, it is a part of my body.]{.underline}**

**[I carry a river. It is who I am: 'Aha Makav. This is not a
metaphor.]{.underline}**

**[. . .]{.underline}**

**['Aha Makav is the true name of our people, given to us by our
Cre-]{.underline}**

**[ator who loosed the river from the earth and built it into our
liv-]{.underline}**

**[ing bodies.]{.underline}**

**[Translated into English, 'Aha Makav means the river runs
through]{.underline}**

**[the middle of our body, the same way it runs through the
middle]{.underline}**

**[of our land.]{.underline}**

**[This is a poor translation, like all translations.]{.underline}**

**[In American imaginations, the logic of this image will lend itself
to]{.underline}**

**[surrealism or magic realism---]{.underline}**

**[Americans prefer a magical red Indian, or a shaman, or a fake
Indian]{.underline}**

**[in a red dress, over a real Native. Even a real Native carrying
the]{.underline}**

**[dangerous and heavy blues of a river in her body.]{.underline}**

**[What threatens white people is often dismissed as myth. I
have]{.underline}**

**[never been true in America. America is my myth.33]{.underline}**

In these stanzas, '**[Aha Makav are inseparable entities simultaneously
land, water, and the human body, entwined and impossible to parse. Diaz
stresses that this is not metaphorical; she carries a river in her body,
and it is the first water]{.underline}**. [The water described by Diaz
is not something additional to land, nor are the two mutually exclusive.
Diaz insists that even this nonmetaphorical reality will be rendered
into an image, simplified into something American imaginations prefer to
interpret, something saturated in magical realism. **Native
relationships to land and water are often overdetermined by an outside
gaze more interested in a simulation of Indianness and not the reality
of, for instance, 'Aha Makav as it is lived and experienced under
settler capitalism. In the same way the translation into English can
never fully encapsulate the reality of the simultaneity of 'Aha Makav
the- people- and- the- river, the translation of Native water or land
into the law will always be insufficient and never fully
realized**]{.underline}--- it [has never been true in America. Water as
river, lake, or other waterbody is one central part of material Native
life, as is land. Ocean and island are key analytical modes of thought
in Pacific/Oceania studies as well as in Black diaspora studies,
especially of the Caribbean and the Black Atlantic.]{.underline}34 As
Hi'ilei Hobart writes, "**[Across time performance and literary works
produced by Pacific Islander artists recognize water as an agential
being." 35 The ocean has provided an epistemological arena for "the
lives and writings of those for whom the sea was simultaneously
workplace, home, passage, penitentiary, and promise]{.underline}**." 36
**[Authors, poets, and scholars whose works constitute conversations and
knowledge production about water have long articulated Indigenous and
Black relationships to sea and ocean in ways that trouble continental
and over- terrestrial thinking.]{.underline}** [In this discussion of
ocean and watery analytics, the intention is not to marginalize land as
less crucial but to highlight that a range of theoretical lenses and
opportunities buoy up in ways that may not occur if terrestrial- land is
permanently at the fore.]{.underline} **[In so doing it is possible to
not just bring critical attention to water and its forms but also to
push on the neatness of the categories themselves that potentially
operate to keep experience and expertise separate from one another, and
to also invite ice to join in the chorus]{.underline}**. [Across Oceania
and Black diaspora studies, ocean animates multiple kinds of movement,
mobility, theft, and offering.37 Such work analyzes, imagines, and
reimagines histories of ocean travel both as cosmologically central and
supremely violent through migrations both forced and
chosen]{.underline}. [**Across both orientations, ocean relationships
are writ as analytics of daily life, sociality, and origin for arrival
in place as well as a relation and connection to the rest of the world
through shared ocean waters. Scholars of Blackness and the aftermaths of
slavery in their situated particularities provide insight into what the
ocean might mean to that set of ongoing experiences.38 As Tiffany
Lethabo King writes,** "The enduring metaphor and actual space of the
ocean has pulsed through Black diasporic literature, criticism, art, and
theory. The Middle Passage and 'crossings' of African- descended people
in particular has animated and served as an arterial through line in
Anglo- African, Anglo- Caribbean, and Black Canadian, as well as
Hispanophone and Lusophone traditions."]{.underline} 39 **[The ocean and
the sea animate analyses and thought production around the Middle
Passage, the slave ship, and its multiplicity of
afterlives.]{.underline}**

will take your life. Modern technology and life delude people into a
false sense of security. This land will still kill you."]{.underline}**
57 [This philosophy is not meant to dramatize the severity or reinforce

writes, **["The Land has no hierarchy. The Land has no manners; you only
obey and enjoy what is afforded to you by her greatness]{.underline}**.
**[Only logic and great care ensure your survival. Only patterns of
skills gifted by our ancestors keep us living . . . we obey or we

**["In the Arctic, such attention is not an option but is necessary, and
it yields appreciation for the precarity, the contingency, of simply
being."]{.underline}** 59 [Jones writes in another essay about this
formulation as a particular kind of Yup'ik awareness, drawing from
Harold Napoleon's writing on yuuyaraq, or "the way of the human being."
60 Jones states, "Our laws were known by all, and every Yuk was
responsible for holding themselves and others accountable to yuuyaraq
laws and structures. Yuuyaraq is the product of thousands of years of
wisdom from people living and learning the lessons of the
North."]{.underline} 61 **[This Yup'ik sense of awareness is formulated
in co- constitution with the land and its particularities, making it
resonate with Bigjim's offering that an Inupiaq life is "so involved /
with the movement / of the ice floe."]{.underline}** [The necessities
for attentive excellence in ice geographies are repeated across
literature originating with some of the first Inuit novels ever
published, Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk's Sanaaq and Markoosie Patsauq's Hunter
with Harpoon.]{.underline} 62 [Both novels offer spare prose that
chronicle the daily and seasonal practices of hunting, harvesting,
cleaning, and preparing food.]{.underline} [Each novel features a
protagonist who leads us through the daily goings- on in their homeland
icescape. In Nappaaluk we follow Sanaaq, and in Patsauq we follow Kamik,
two kinds of coming- of- age stories about a young woman and man,
respectively.]{.underline} In each story **[we learn of the
relationships and constant presence and alertness needed for each task
in Arctic spaces. There is little room for mistake, and movements must
be made with care and attention.]{.underline}** Moreover, [the "setting"
of the icescape---the milieu or atmosphere of the cold--- is its own
character. For instance, in Sanaaq, characters dive beneath the ice to
gather mussels, and even though Sanaaq's mother, Qumaq, does not want
her young daughter to go gathering for fear she "might bang into
something," she relents. Nappaaluk writes: "Qalingu began bashing away
with the ice chisel to open up a tunnel down into a large qulluniq. With
his hands he removed the shards of ice. He looked really tired. When the
opening was wide enough, he knocked the last shards out and, with the
water level no longer falling, everyone rushed to climb down under the
ice. 'Let's go! Let's go down,' said Arnatuinaaq very happily. . . . And
they went down."]{.underline} 63 **[Sadly for Qalingu, when gathering
mussels under the ice, he does not look closely enough to see that what
he collects are empty shells, much to the humorous delight of his
friends who later share their harvest with him. The characters in Sanaaq
are below and above the ice, swimming through the water and tunnelling
through the opening--- not simply participating upon the
surface.]{.underline}**

### Arctic Debates Good\-\--2AC

#### Debates about arctic policy changes are [valuable]{.underline} for student skills, critical thinking, and ethical self-reflexivity. 

**Essex 24**, Department of Political Science @ University of Windsor.
(Jamey, 2024, "Coming in from the Cold: Arctic Council Debate Simulation
and the Political Geographies of a Global Region," The Geography
Teacher, Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group)

Liberal and realist theories---and the **[debate]{.underline}** between
them--- have dominated the field of IR for decades and strongly
[shaped]{.underline} not only [how we understand]{.underline} the
**[international state system]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} states as
territorial and sovereign actors but also the actual practice of
**[statecraft]{.underline}** and the makeup and operation of many
international institutions (Snyder 2004). The scenario exercise
described in more detail below, which builds from tensions between
realism and liberalism in institutions such as the Arctic Council, was
developed in the context of a senior seminar for university
undergraduate IR students. It is here, though, that geographic
perspectives on the international system, and the Arctic as a kind of
place, help complicate the liberal-realist dichotomy that dominates much
of IR thinking and that often presents geographic space in static ways.
Changes in the nature of the state and the conduct of international
relations together with economic globalization, climate change, and the
reemergence of nationalism have all challenged realist and liberal
notions of state sovereignty and territory. [This]{.underline} has
prompted a "**[spatial turn]{.underline}**" in the disciplines of
Political Science and IR, as scholars in those fields [have tried to
take spatial relations and geographic organization and representation
more seriously]{.underline}. Yet Clark and Jones (2013, 306; see also
Jones and Clark 2020) argue that attempts at working across disciplinary
divides often still founder on a basic sense of space as "an abstract,
uniform, featureless medium upon which human political action is played
out" [rather than building]{.underline} an understanding of [space and
geography as]{.underline} **[constitutive elements]{.underline}** [of
**international political relations**]{.underline}. Taking for granted
states as territorial units exercising sovereignty through
administration and defense of clearly bounded national space remains a
bedrock of mainstream IR theories.

By contrast, [political geographers]{.underline} have attempted to
understand and **[critique]{.underline}** these
[taken-for-granted]{.underline} notions of **[sovereignty]{.underline}**
[based in state territory]{.underline} for at least three decades.
Agnew's (1994, 58) work on the "territorial trap" in Political Science
and IR approaches is most useful here, and in this he argues that "three
contextual factors have interacted to reproduce the dominant view about
state territoriality" that limits these disciplines' ability to
understand shifts in sovereignty and the state's basis in territorial
control. [These are]{.underline}, first, a "**[preference]{.underline}**
[for abstract]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
'**[closed-system']{.underline}** [thinking among advocates of a
scientific (positivist) approach]{.underline}" that takes the
territorial state as the pregiven basic unit of analysis; second, the
"muddling of two terms, state and nation" in a way that "endows the
territorial state with the legitimacy of representing and expressing the
'character' or 'will' of the nation"; and finally, an "intellectual
division of labour" that dates to the First World War and that too
neatly separates the international arena and domestic politics as
different areas of study and practice (Agnew 1994, 58--59). While some
Political Science and IR scholars (Ethington and McDaniel 2007; Kadercan
2015; Kristensen 2015; see also Murphy 1999; O\'Loughlin 2018; Jones and
Clark 2020) have tried to incorporate a more geographically nuanced
approach, [these three traits continue to shape how these fields see the
state, territory, and the conduct of international affairs.]{.underline}

[**Political** and environmental **changes**]{.underline} [in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, and the Arctic Council itself, [provide a
useful case for exploring the]{.underline} **[interplay between
disciplines]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[challenges to narrow
territory-based understandings of the state as a kind of political actor
contending with contemporary global issues.]{.underline}** Geographer
Klaus Dodds (2018, 191) noted in explaining the concept of the "global
Arctic" that the northern polar region "is not ... imagined to be a
regional container with hard boundaries but rather something created by
the intersection of territories and flows," the kind of place that makes
borders hard to demarcate and police while also disrupting rigid
concepts of national security. [Much of this need to rethink security
and sovereignty in the Arctic stems from the environmental processes at
work in the region, which is both a setting for some of the more extreme
consequences of climate change]{.underline} (e.g., rapidly decreasing
sea ice, melting of permafrost, ocean warming, and numerous positive
feedback loops that strengthen climate change processes) and a harbinger
of wider global-scale climate impacts, especially as the region opens
more widely to resource exploitation, maritime shipping, and
geopolitical tensions (Gerhardt et al. 2010; Steinberg & Dodds 2013;
Steinberg et al. 2015). It is no wonder, then, that many non-Arctic
states and actors (i.e., those without national territory above the
Arctic Circle) have taken a greater interest in the use and management
of the Arctic.

Lesson Overview

The lesson described here follows from the premises described above: The
Arctic is a global region but is divided and managed across many forms
of sovereignty; experiencing profound environmental changes with local,
regional, and global impacts; and a space in which traditional notions
and practices of state sovereignty and geopolitical thinking are being
both entrenched and challenged. It follows **[a simulation
format]{.underline}** [in which]{.underline} **[students]{.underline}**
are asked to [take on specific roles]{.underline} representing various
members of the Arctic Council [and]{.underline} to [act out]{.underline}
via **[research]{.underline}**, **[debate]{.underline}**, a formal vote,
[and]{.underline} subsequent **[writing]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
reports **[a particular hypothetical]{.underline}** question [that can
demonstrate how]{.underline} liberal and realist **[theories in IR
operate]{.underline}** in practice [and how]{.underline} **[critical
geographic concepts]{.underline}** of region, scale, territory, and
state sovereignty can [help push]{.underline} **[beyond the
limits]{.underline}** [of these approaches]{.underline} in IR. The
hypothetical question posed centers on the addition of a non-Arctic
state--- China---as a permanent voting member of the Arctic Council. In
the scenario for the simulation, China has decided to move from being an
observer "near-Arctic" state and press for full membership on the
Council. This follows from recent moves by China to establish a stronger
regional presence through economic and scientific partnerships with
Arctic states as well as China's development of its own Arctic strategy,
which was released in January 2018 and describes the country as "an
important stakeholder in Arctic affairs" (State Council Information
Office of the People's Republic of China 2018).

While there has been no specific push for China to move from observer
status at the Arctic Council to full voting member and it is unclear
whether such a move would even be possible given the constraints of the
organization and the Ottawa Declaration, a hypothetical scenario like
this permits some creative thinking based in real-world possibilities
and strategies and can help students overcome biases and preconceived
ideas that may be inherent in dealing with existing scenarios based on
current events (Taylor 2013; Shaw and Switky 2018). [Simulating a full
special Arctic Council meeting at which this application is
**presented**, **debated**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[voted
upon]{.underline}** [allows students to **research**]{.underline},
present, [and]{.underline} **[debate]{.underline}** [the role of
**non-** and near-Arctic **states**]{.underline} in this global region
and, given the Council's varied membership, to investigate the meaning
of territory and sovereignty in relation to national interests,
Indigenous rights, and regional and global environmental stewardship.
Guided by the core tenets of liberal and realist understandings of
international relations and the political geographic critique of these
approaches, [students develop a sense of the complicated realities of
international institutions in practice and the intersection of multiple
issues across place and scale in the Arctic region.]{.underline}

Goals and Time Required

In this scenario, students represent different members of the Arctic
Council, with one representative from a member state acting as chair and
assuring that the agenda is followed and speakers are recognized and
held to time limits, as they debate China's application for full voting
membership. In doing so and presenting positions for or against the
inclusion of China as a full member, they may consider various points
addressed in background readings and primary documents, discussed below,
and the following specific questions, which can help prepare students
for the in-class Arctic Council meeting simulation itself:

• **[What]{.underline}** major processes and **[trends]{.underline}**
[are driving]{.underline} political, social, economic, and environmental
**[change]{.underline}** in the Arctic region**[?]{.underline}** [What
are the pressing issues]{.underline} that the Council might have to
address in this, and how would the addition of China as a full member
enhance or complicate the Arctic Council's capacity to fulfill its
mandate[?]{.underline}

What are the principles that underlie the Arctic Council's existence and
mandate? What strategies and processes within and around the Council
ensure this mandate is met (or not)?

How do the different members and observers within the Arctic Council see
that body's role in managing the Arctic as a shared, global region and
providing a platform for pursuing national and international interests?

[What are the specific national or organizational interests]{.underline}
of the different actors within the Arctic Council, and how might China's
more complete integration into that body alter the dynamics of the
Council and how other actors approach it[?]{.underline}

• **[What forms of power are relevant to the hypothetical scenario
presented]{.underline}**, and how might different actors within the
Council present themselves within the context of a high-level
deliberation and potential vote on an issue of this
magnitude**[?]{.underline}**

How does the issue of China's status in the Arctic Council relate to
both the definition of the Arctic as a region and to broader themes and
trends beyond but affecting that region? [How does the Arctic's position
as a shared region shape different members' particular interests but
also how they view the intersection of issues across scales such as
climate change, economic development, cultural and political rights, and
global status?]{.underline}

This is a wide set of questions and, in practice, a full class meeting
of an undergraduate seminar course, totaling almost three hours, worked
well for this simulation, with additional outof-class time before and
after for preparation and writing of a summary report. This time allowed
for each member state, Indigenous representative, and observer state or
group to make a brief position statement, followed by open debate and a
final vote. This could be broken across two class periods, one for
statements and one for debate and vote, with time in between for side
meetings and negotiation, as would be common in any international body
that could take multiple hours or even days to consider and decide on
such a move. Like any high-level meeting, a clear agenda and
parliamentary procedure would guide the deliberations; a sample agenda
is shown in Figure 1.

Outcomes

The direct outcome of the discussion and debate about China's Arctic
Council membership application is a formal vote on the motion, "Should
the People's Republic of China be accepted as a full member of the
Arctic Council?" In practice, only the representatives of the Council's
eight member states would vote, while the six Indigenous peoples'
organizations that are permanent participants have the right to be
consulted on all Council decisions and negotiations and are supported in
this work by the Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat. Currently,
thirty-eight observers also have status within the Council, contributing
to projects, programs, and research initiatives through the Working
Groups that structure the body's primary activities. The observer group
consists of thirteen non-Arctic states (including China), thirteen
intergovernmental organizations, and twelve nongovernmental
organizations, providing a wide range of actors from which to assign
roles to students in setting up the simulation. While final
decision-making is in the hands of the eight Arctic state members, they
work by consensus rather than simple majoritarian votes, providing ample
room for students to negotiate and debate points of contention in
dealing with the particular scenario presented.

[While Indigenous representatives do not vote, the duty to consult them
and their right to address the Council during meetings give them a
powerful voice and an almost de facto veto power in the Council's
deliberations. These factors also complicate the notion that sovereignty
in the Arctic is exercised by states alone or that it is based solely on
territorial control by states]{.underline}. As Indigenous peoples often
reside across national boundaries and have rights articulated through
international framework agreements, most importantly the UN Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, incorporating their voices more
directly in Council deliberations and the simulation exercise also
prevents national interest and security from being read simplistically
and directly from state strategies. This also follows robust discussions
within the Council and Indigenous people's organizations about
Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination and highlights differences
within and between the permanent participants so that they are not read
as a single bloc with a unitary set of interests, capacities, or
national contexts (Cambou 2018; Landriault, Payette, and Roussel 2021).
[Likewise, the wide array of observer groups and states that would
provide consultative feedback on the question of **China's elevation**
from **observer** to full **voting member** introduces non-state actors
into consideration and **forces a debate** over the **political**,
**social**, **economic**, and **environmental** impacts of allowing a
**near-Arctic state** to sit alongside **Arctic
counterparts**]{.underline}. Following the statements, deliberation, and
vote in class, students write a report (at the senior undergraduate
level, students were asked to aim for five to seven pages) on the
primary issues that were debated, especially considerations of
sovereignty, territory, and geopolitics in a global Arctic; how these
related to their particular role in the simulation; and how these can
help students understand liberal and realist theories in IR. [In
addition to building familiarity with the specific empirical content
addressed in this simulation, such as issues around climate change,
sovereignty and territory, and geographic perspectives on IR theories,
students build research, presentation, and collaboration skills and gain
an appreciation for the complexity and nuance of geopolitics, diplomacy,
and international relations in practice.]{.underline}

**Vickers 19**, Department of Education, Kyushu University (Edward
Vickers, 2019, "Critiquing coloniality, 'epistemic violence' and western
hegemony in comparative education -- the dangers of ahistoricism and
positionality," Comparative Education Journal, University of Kansas
Libraries, Taylor and Francis)

The empirical and theoretical flaws of this approach are intertwined
with the problematic language in which its arguments are typically
couched. Historical and anthropological scholarship on East Asia and
other regions amply demonstrates that colonialist or neo-colonialist
attitudes and strategies of domination are not and have never been a
Western monopoly. But decolonial theory posits the more or less uniform
victimhood of non-Western 'others,' deriving claims for the moral
superiority of 'authentically' indigenous perspectives. Debating the
validity of such claims is complicated by an emphasis on
'positionality.' Readers are exhorted to judge an argument less by
standards of evidence or logic (often portrayed as camouflaging a
Western 'will to power') than on the basis of the writer's
self-identification or 'positioning.' [The language of '**epistemic
violence**,']{.underline} 'secure spaces,' 'epistemological diffidence,'
'border thinking' and 'location' [suggests an **image** of the
**critical scholar** as revolutionary guerrilla, valiantly **sniping**
at Western **hegemony** from \[their\]]{.underline} ~~his or her~~
[marginal redoubt]{.underline}. In so far as this reflects a desire for
a more just, tolerant and sustainable society -- one that values
diversity as a resource for mutual learning -- it is admirable.
[However, if we seek to **combat oppression**, in the educational sphere
or beyond, it is **incumbent** on us to **pick our
enemies**]{.underline}, and our language, [carefully. Aiming a
**blunderbuss** at the supposedly illegitimate]{.underline} or
self-serving ['universalism']{.underline} of 'modern Western social
science,' [while **ignoring** how calls for indigenisation and
'**authenticity**' are used to **legitimate** highly **oppressive
regimes** across **Asia** and elsewhere, is to risk **undermining**
those **universal social** and political values (freedom of
**expression**, civil **liberties**, rule of **law**) upon which
**critical scholars themselves rely**]{.underline}.

An embrace of 'opacity' or 'epistemological diffidence,' advocated by
several of the CER contributors, threatens to be similarly
self-defeating. While they share an admiration for the Argentine
theorist of 'decoloniality,' Walter Mignolo, the work of his brilliant
compatriot, the writer, poet and essayist Jorge Luis Borges, is far
worthier of attention. Borges' famous fondness for 'labyrinths' and the
paradoxical was combined with a sharp eye for gratuitous obfuscation and
circumlocution (see, for example, his story The Aleph, in Borges 1998,
274--286). Offering his own critique of the fashion for opaque jargon in
mainstream social science, the émigré Polish sociologist Stanislav
Andreski wrote acerbically that 'one of the pleasures obtainable through
recourse to confusion and absurdity is to be able to feel, and publicly
to claim, that one knows when in reality one does not' (1974, 95).
'Opacity' in imaginative literature may intrigue or entertain, but in
interpreting and explaining unfamiliar societies, cultures and education
systems, comparativists especially ought to write in clear, accessible
language. And while all social scientists can understand the lure of the
sweeping generalisation, we should generalise with extreme caution,
especially when categorising large swathes of humanity.

Borges' earliest collection of stories is entitled A Universal History
of Iniquity. This appeared in 1935, when there were already rumblings in
both East and West of the conflict that would soon engulf Eurasia.
Implied in his title was a truth painfully obvious to many
contemporaries: that iniquity is indeed universal. The conflicts of the
mid-twentieth century starkly illuminated another truth: that iniquity
in the modern world, especially (though not only) that associated with
totalitarian societies, often consists in essentialising and
de-humanising 'the other'. Hannah Arendt -- a thoroughly Eurocentric
thinker, but one who addressed, in 'totalitarianism,' a theme with
global ramifications -- wrote of how, through 'the murder of the moral
person in man,' totalitarian systems transform their citizens into
'living corpses' capable of any outrage (2017, 591). But ironically, in
the very act of attacking essentialism as applied to 'non-Western'
cultures, the CER contributors propagate an essentialised view of 'the
West' itself. Iniquity in the form of coloniality is in their account
attributed solely to Western modernity. This view is both inaccurate and
dangerous.

The irony in this approach extends to the attribution of agency. Claims
to champion the dignity of subaltern, 'non-Western' actors are in fact
undermined by assertions of their uniform victimhood. This reproduces
the very Eurocentrism that 'decolonial' scholars quite rightly seek to
challenge. In fact, privilege and victimhood have many dimensions, by no
means all traceable to the 'phenomenon of colossal vagueness' that is
colonialism (Osterhammel 2005, 4). One group or individual can plausibly
be portrayed as victim, or perpetrator, or both, depending on context
and perspective. Were post-war German civilian refugees from Eastern
Europe, or Japanese civilians fleeing Manchuria, victims or
perpetrators? Or today, is a privately-educated, English-speaking,
upper-caste South Asian scholar more accurately to be seen as privileged
or under-privileged, in terms of access to power ('epistemic' or
otherwise) within South Asia or the global academy? 'Location' or
identity are not reducible to neat labels or discrete categories. As the
Anglo-Ghanaian philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah emphasises, according
dignity and agency involves recognising that our identities are not just
socially given, but also actively chosen. Culture is 'a process you
join, in living a life with others,' and 'the values that European
humanists like to espouse belong as much to an African or an Asian who
takes them up with enthusiasm as to a European' (2018, 211). The same
applies with respect to value systems we have reason to regard as
iniquitous, such as those associated with colonialism or neoliberalism.

What, then, are we to make of the traction that totalising
anti-Westernism appears to be gaining within the CIE field? On one
level, this may tell us more about the state of campus politics, and
politics in general, across contemporary America and the broader
'Anglosphere', than about the wider world. The worldview that the CER
contributors espouse, even as they strain at the shackles of Western
epistemology, is redolent of America's peculiarly racialised identity
politics. And notwithstanding claims to marginal positionality, the
increasingly widespread currency of such arguments in North American and
Anglophone CIE circles reflects their status as an emergent orthodoxy
that in key respects mirrors the very ethnocentrism it rejects.

Although the ideas in the CER special issue are presented as challenging
both the scholarly mainstream and a wider neoliberal or neocolonial
establishment, the seriousness of this challenge is doubtful.
[Exhortations to]{.underline} embrace 'opacity' or [to '**think
otherwise**' in the name of '**contesting coloniality**' imply no
coherent **programme**, and suggest an **overwhelmingly** negative
agenda]{.underline}. Meanwhile, far from risking ostracism, the
contributors can expect warm endorsement of their views from regulars at
the major international conferences. For many in the CIE community in
North America and beyond, [**sweeping critiques** of Western
'**hegemony**', '**coloniality**' and so forth hold a **strong
appeal**]{.underline}; it is those seeking to question the balance or
accuracy of such theorising who risk opprobrium. As Merquior wrote of
Foucault, Derrida and their postmodernist or 'deconstructivist'
followers, their 'skepsis', 'highly placed in the core institutions of
the culture it so strives to undermine,' has come to constitute an
'official marginality' (1991, 160).

The potential -- and actual -- consequences of this are troubling.
Takayama et al call for the WCCES in particular to embrace the agenda of
'contesting coloniality,' but one conclusion to be drawn from recent
events is that this is already happening, with damaging consequences for
civility within the Comparative Education field, and for the wider
credibility of its scholarly output.15 Reducing scholarship to the
projection of the scholar's own positionality can only lead to
fragmentation and irrelevance. To quote Merquior again (paraphrasing
Hilary Putnam), 'to demote rationality, in a relativist way, to a mere
concoction of a given historical culture is as reductionist as the
logical positivist's reduction of reason to scientific calculus' (160).
What he calls the 'Elixir of Pure Negation' (159) is an intoxicating
brew, [but it is **unlikely** to inspire **coherent** or constructive
**contributions** to addressing the **pressing problems** of our age:
climate change, poverty, inequality and the ethical crisis that
underpins them all.]{.underline}

Indeed, [it is **very likely** to **do the opposite**]{.underline}. The
neoliberal cadres of the OECD or World Bank, along with [nationalist
**autocrats** from **Beijing**]{.underline} to Budapest, [will be **more
than happy** for '**critical scholars**' to fulminate against a
vaguely-defined **'West'** while embracing '**epistemological
diffidence**']{.underline} (Takayama, Sriprakash, and Connell 2017,
S18). As one critic of 'postmodernism' has put it, the promotion of
'epistemological pluralism,' combined with rejection of any 'settled
external viewpoint,' means that, ['so far as real-life **ongoing
politics** is concerned,']{.underline} postmodernists, along with
de-constructivists, [decolonialists]{.underline} and their ilk, [tend to
be 'passively **conservative in effect**']{.underline} (Butler 2002,
61). If 'decoloniality' promotes a balkanisation of the Comparative
Education field into identity-based cliques that prize 'opacity,' the
risk is that in practice this will only serve to buttress the status
quo.

[**Every policy** is a **prediction**. Tax cuts will **boost** the
**economy**. Sanctions will **slow Iran's** nuclear **program**. Travel
bans will **limit** the spread of **COVID-19**. These claims all posit a
**causal relationship** between means and ends]{.underline}. Regardless
of party, ideology, or motive, no policymaker wants his or her \[their\]
recommended course of action to produce unanticipated consequences. This
makes every policymaker a forecaster. [But **forecasting** is
**difficult**, particularly when it comes to **geopolitics** --- a
domain in which the rules of **the game** are **poorly
understood**]{.underline}, information is invariably incomplete, and
expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting
future events.

These challenges present practical problems for decision-makers in the
U.S. government. On the one hand, the limits of imagination create blind
spots that policymakers tend to fill in with past experience. They often
assume that tomorrow's dangers will look like yesterday's, retaining the
same mental map even as the territory around them changes dramatically.
On the other hand, if policymakers addressed all imaginable threats, the
United States would need so large and expensive a national security
establishment that the country could do little else. By many measures,
it is nearing this point already. The United States has military bases
in more than 70 countries and territories, boasts more than four million
federal employees with security clearances, and fields 1.3 million
active-duty troops, with another million in reserve. According to one
estimate, the United States spends \$1.25 trillion annually on national
security. When it comes to anticipating the future, then, the United
States is getting the worst of both worlds. It spends untold sums of
money preparing yet still finds itself the victim of surprise ---
fundamentally ill equipped for defining events, such as the emergence of
COVID-19.

There is a better way, one that would allow [the **U**nited **S**tates
to make **decisions** based **not on** simplistic extrapolations of the
past but on smart **estimates** of the future]{.underline}. It [involves
**reconciling**]{.underline} two approaches often seen to be at
philosophical loggerheads: [**scenario planning** and probabilistic
**forecasting**]{.underline}. Each approach has a fundamentally
different assumption about the future. Scenario planners maintain that
there are so many possible futures that one can imagine them only in
terms of plausibility, not probability. By contrast, forecasters believe
it is possible to calculate the odds of possible outcomes, thereby
transforming amorphous uncertainty into quantifiable risk. Because each
method has its strengths, the optimal approach is to combine them. [This
**holistic method** would provide policymakers with both a **range** of
conceivable **futures** and regular updates as to **which** one is
**likely** to emerge]{.underline}. For once, they could make shrewd bets
about tomorrow, today.

PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTY

Although widely used in business today, the first element of this duo
--- [**scenario planning** --- grew out of post--**World War II**
national security **concerns**, specifically the]{.underline}
overwhelming uncertainty of the [**nuclear** revolution]{.underline}.
Previously, martial experience was thought to offer some guidance
through the fog of war. Nuclear weapons, however, presented a novel
problem. With the newfound ability to destroy each other as functioning
societies in a matter of minutes or hours, the United States and the
Soviet Union faced an unprecedented situation. And unprecedented
situations are, by definition, uncertain. They lack any analogy to the
past that would allow decision-makers to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes.

Still, [**early** U.S. efforts at nuclear-**war planning** sought to
turn that problem into a **calculable one**]{.underline}. During World
War II, the Allies had great success with the new field of operations
research, [the application of statistical methods]{.underline} to
improve the outcome of tactical engagements. After the war, [the
**RAND** Corporation]{.underline} --- a "think factory" that the U.S.
Air Force established as a repository for leading researchers --- [hoped
to **parlay** this success into a new, **more rational** approach to
**war**, based]{.underline} less on the intuition of generals and more
[on the **quantification** afforded by **models** and
**data**]{.underline}.

Unfortunately, methods that worked at the tactical level proved nearly
farcical at the strategic level. As the historian David Jardini has
chronicled, RAND's first attempt to model a nuclear strategy ignored so
many key variables that it nonsensically called for deploying a fleet of
aging turboprop bombers that carried no bombs because the United States
did not have enough fissile material to arm them; the goal was simply to
overwhelm Soviet air defenses, with no regard for the lives of the
pilots. In the wake of such failures, it became clear that analysts
could not entirely banish uncertainty. In 1960, even Charles Hitch, a
man predisposed to calculation by dint of being RAND's top economist and
president of what was then the Operations Research Society of America,
cautioned, "No other characteristic of decision-making is as pervasive
as uncertainty."

[That, of course, **raised** the question of **how to** formulate
sensible **strategy**]{.underline}. Unexpectedly, it was a RAND
mathematician and physicist, Herman Kahn, who offered an answer. If the
lived past could not shape strategy, [perhaps the **imagined future**
could. Frustrated with **RAND's** attempts to **scientize war**, Kahn
devoted himself to **craft**ing scenarios]{.underline} in the pursuit of
"ersatz experience" [that would **prepare** the **U**nited **S**tates
for the **future through** what were essentially **thought
experiments**. Policymakers could **use these** scenarios]{.underline}
as "artificial 'case histories' and 'historical anecdotes,'" Kahn wrote,
[thus **making up** for a lack of actual examples or meaningful
**data**]{.underline}. They would provide analogies where there were
none.

Early methods of generating scenarios were often freewheeling and
discursive. But after scenario planning migrated to the business world,
it took on more structured forms. The most recognizable is a two-by-two
matrix in which planners identify two critical uncertainties and, taking
the extreme values of each, construct four possible future worlds.
Regardless of the specific shape they take, rigorous scenario-planning
exercises all involve identifying key uncertainties and then imagining
how different combinations could yield situations that are vastly
different from what mere extrapolation of the present would suggest. By
then "backcasting" --- taking one of these imagined futures as a given
and asking what conditions produced it --- [scenario planners **derive**
both a **story** and a **system**. They come up with a **plausible
narrative** of how a **future happened** and an internal logic that
**describes** how it **operates**. Scenarios]{.underline} are not
supposed to be predictive. They [are **meant** to be **provocative**,
challenging planners' **assumptions**, shaking up their **mental
models** of how the world works, and giving them the **cognitive
flexibility** to better sense, shape, and **adapt** to the emerging
**future**.]{.underline}

#### Knowledge and understanding are possible based on empirical observations\-\--that is the best way to debate about and understand events. 

**Walt 5**, Robert and Renée Belfer Professor of International Affairs

in International Relations," Annual Review of Political Science, Vol. 8,
pp. 23-48)

[First]{.underline} and most obviously, [a good theory should be
**logically consistent and empirically valid**]{.underline}, because a
[logical explanation that is consistent with the available evidence
is]{.underline} more [likely to provide an accurate guide to the causal
connections that shape events]{.underline}.

[Second, a good theory is **complete**; it does not leave us wondering
about the causal relationships at work]{.underline} (Van Evera 1997).
For example, a theory stating that "national leaders go to war when the
expected utility of doing so outweighs the expected utility of all
alternative choices" (Bueno de Mesquita & Lalman 1992) may be logically
impeccable, but it does not tell us when leaders will reach this
judgment. Similarly, [a theory is unsatisfying when it identifies an
important causal factor but not the factor(s) most responsible for
determining outcomes]{.underline}. [To say that "human nature causes
war," or even that "oxygen causes war," is true in the sense that war as
we know it cannot occur in the absence of these elements]{.underline}.
[But such information does not help us understand what we want to
know]{.underline}, namely, [when is war more or less
likely?]{.underline} [Completeness also implies that the theory has no
"debilitating gaps,"]{.underline} such as an omitted variable
[that]{.underline} either [makes its predictions]{.underline}
unacceptably [imprecise or leads to biased inferences]{.underline} about
other factors (Nincic & Lepgold 2000, p. 28).

A [third]{.underline} desideratum [is **explanatory
power**]{.underline}. A theory's explanatory power [is its ability to
account for phenomena that would otherwise seem mystifying]{.underline}.
[Theories are]{.underline} especially [valuable when they illuminate a
diverse array of behavior that previously seemed unrelated and
perplexing]{.underline}, and they are most useful when they make
apparently odd or surprising events seem comprehensible (Rapaport 1972).
[In physics, it seems contrary to common sense to think that light would
be bent by gravity]{.underline}. [Yet Einstein's theory of relativity
explains why this is so]{.underline}. In economics, it might seem
counterintuitive to think that nations would be richer if they abolished
barriers to trade and did not try to hoard specie (as mercantilist
doctrines prescribed). The Smith/Ricardo theory of free trade tells us
why, but it took several centuries before the argument was widely
accepted (Irwin 1996). In international politics, it seems odd to
believe that a country would be safer if it were unable to threaten its
opponent's nuclear forces, but deterrence theory explains why mutual
vulnerability may be preferable to either side having a large capacity
to threaten the other side's forces (Wohlstetter 1957, Schelling 1960,
Glaser 1990, Jervis 1990). This is what we mean by a powerful theory:
[Once we understand it, previously unconnected or baffling phenomena
make sense]{.underline}.

Fourth, at the risk of stating the obvious, we prefer theories that
explain an important phenomenon (i.e., something that is likely to
affect the fates of many people). Individual scholars may disagree about
the relative importance of different issues, but a theory that deals
with a problem of some magnitude is likely to garner greater attention
and/or respect than a theory that successfully addresses a puzzle of
little intrinsic interest. Thus, a compelling yet flawed explanation for
great power war or genocide is likely to command a larger place in the
field than an impeccable theory that explains the musical
characteristics of national anthems.

[Fifth, a theory is]{.underline} more [useful when it is
**prescriptively rich**]{.underline}, i.e., when it yields useful
recommendations (Van Evera 1997). For this reason, George advises
scholars to "include in their research designs variables over which
policymakers have some leverage" (George 2000, p. xiv; also Glaser &
Strauss 1967, Stein 2000). Yet a theory that does not include
manipulable variables may still be useful to policy makers. For example,
a theory that explained why a given policy objective was impossible
might be very useful if it convinced a policy maker not to pursue such
an elusive goal. Similarly, [a theory that accurately forecast the risk
of war might provide a useful warning to policy makers even if the
variables in the theory were not subject to manipulation]{.underline}.

[Finally, theories are more valuable when they are **stated
clearly**]{.underline}. Ceteris paribus, [a theory that is hard to
understand is less useful simply because it takes more time for
potential users to master it.]{.underline} Although academics often like
to be obscure (because [incomprehensibility can]{.underline} both [make
scholarship seem more profound and make it harder to tell when a
particular argument is wrong]{.underline}), **[opacity
impedes]{.underline}** scientific **[progress and is not a
virtue]{.underline}** in theoreticalwork. [An obscure and impenetrable
theory is also less likely to influence]{.underline} busy [policy
makers]{.underline}.

#### Empiricism is [good]{.underline} and there's [no alternative]{.underline}\-\--the only [reasonable]{.underline} way to draw conclusions is to adopt the [best available]{.underline} theoretical explanation through [empirical adequacy]{.underline}.

He points out, however, that while all anti-realists must reject some
part of this position, they have two options: they can either reject the
idea that scientific theories should be literally construed or reject
the idea that accepting a literally construed theory requires belief
that it is true (Van Fraassen, 1980: 10). Whereas the first option is
instrumentalist, on Van Fraassen's (1980: 10--11) view 'the apparent
statements of science really are statements, capable of being true or
false' --- if a theory's statements include 'There are electrons', then
the theory implies the existence of electrons. He therefore pursues the
second option.15 He agrees with scientific realists (against
instrumentalists) that [scientific theories should be **construed
literally**, that is, as making **existential assertions** about
**unobservable entities**]{.underline}. He insists, however, [that
construing a theory]{.underline} literally:

[relates]{.underline} not at all to our epistemic attitudes towards
theories, nor to the aim we pursue in constructing theories, but only
[to the correct understanding of what a theory says]{.underline}....
After deciding that the language of science must be literally
understood, we can still say that there is no need to believe good
theories to be true, nor to believe ipso facto that the entities they
postulate are real. (Van Fraassen, 1980: 11--12)

In other words[, scientists can **accept** a **theory** and construe it
literally while, at the same time, '"**bracketing**" its **ontological
implications**']{.underline} (Van Fraassen, 1980: 81).

[On first inspection, this may **sound unpersuasive**]{.underline}. Most
scientists, we may suppose, are entity realists --- they believe (some
of) the theories they accept to be true and hence believe that (some of)
the unobservable entities to which they refer exist. Yet, Van Fraassen
would accept this! He is [not concerned with what scientists in fact
believe, but rather with whether it is **necessary**, for science, that
scientists believe the theories they accept to be true in what they say
about the **unobservable** parts of the world]{.underline}. His view is
[that the **extent** of belief **required** for theory acceptance is
**less**]{.underline} than scientific realists suggest --- scientists
can coherently resist entity realism by [remaining '**agnostic** about
the existence of the unobservable aspects of the world **described** by
science']{.underline} (Van Fraassen, 1980: 72).16

Van Fraassen therefore presents an alternative account of theory
acceptance. [**Accepting** a theory must]{.underline}, he notes,
[involve **belief** that it is '**empirically adequate**']{.underline}
--- [that it is **true** in 'what it **says** about the observable
things and events in the world]{.underline}' (Van Fraassen, 1980: 12).
No scientist can accept a theory that they do not believe at least to
this extent. [**Accepting** a theory also **involves** 'a **commitment**
to confront any **future phenomena**' with the '**conceptual
resources**' which that theory **provides**]{.underline} (Van Fraassen,
1980: 12). This commitment compels scientists to 'immerse' themselves in
the 'world-picture' that the theory constructs and also in its language,
including language that indexes unobservable entities (Van Fraassen,
1980: 81) --- scientists will therefore respond to questions about the
world in the language of and by reference to the picture given by the
theories they accept. Van Fraassen insists, however, that [scientists
can **believe** that a theory is the **best available**]{.underline}
([out of those that are empirically adequate]{.underline}), [and **hence
commit** to it and **employ** its **language** in talking about the
world, yet still **maintain** an **open mind** about **whether** it is
**true** in what it says about the **unobservable** parts of the
world]{.underline}.17 He therefore offers the following summary
statement of constructive empiricism, which is intended to bring out the
contrast with SR:

Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and
acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically
adequate (Van Fraassen, 1980: 12).

The difference between SR and constructive empiricism is therefore
subtle --- it concerns the extent of belief required for theory
acceptance in science. Van Fraassen argues that [**acceptance** requires
belief **only** that a theory is **empirically adequate**]{.underline}
and not, as scientific realists argue, belief that the theory is true
simpliciter. [In other words, acceptance of a theory that makes **truth
claims** about unobservable entities does not require a **commitment**
to]{.underline} entity realism --- [**agnosticism** about the
**reality** of the unobservable entities to which many scientific
theories refer is permitted]{.underline}. He also notes one important
reason for thinking that agnosticism is sufficient for science, namely,
if a theory is true in what it says about unobservable entities this
makes no difference to its empirical content, as compared to it being
[**empirically adequate** --- 'we can have **evidence** for the
**truth** of a theory only via **evidential support** for its
**empirical adequacy**']{.underline} (Van Fraassen, 1985: 255).
Consequently, he argues, belief that a theory is not only empirically
adequate, but also true in what it says about unobservables, is
'supererogatory' --- scientists may believe what theories say about
unobservables but it makes no difference for, and hence is not necessary
for, science.18 Significantly, it follows from this that there is no
theory that a realist-inclined scientist can accept that an agnostic
cannot accept. This is because a theory that is (believed to be) true
and is hence acceptable to the former is, therefore, also (believed to
be) empirically adequate and is hence equally acceptable to the latter.

[This view does **not** have the **negative methodological
consequences**]{.underline} that scientific realists attribute to
instrumentalism. Recall that both Bhaskar and Wight regard empiricism as
conservative. As Wight puts it: the 'realism principle ("is it really
the case?") provides the motor which keeps science running' --- science
progresses, in part, by developing new theories and exposing the
entities they postulate to critical scrutiny (Wight, 2007: 383; see also
Bhaskar, 2008 \[1975\]: 15--16; Patomäki and Wight, 2000: 218). Van
Fraassen notes, however, that 'there have always been reasons to doubt
the empirical adequacy of extant theories' (Van Fraassen, 1980: 93; see
also Chernoff, 2007: 402). One reason for this is that a theory that is
claimed to be empirically adequate is claimed to be true of all the
observable parts of the world, including parts not yet observed (Van
Fraassen, 1980: 72).19 A science that aims to develop theories that are
empirically adequate will therefore not, as Wight (2007: 383) suggests,
prematurely 'come to an end', but will rather be perpetually committed
to devising new and ever-more sophisticated tests of the empirical
adequacy of its theories.

These tests may, moreover, include tests of assumptions about
unobservable entities. Making the case that causal inquiry in IR should
focus on causal mechanisms, and hence should embrace SR, Bennett (2013:
466) notes that theories involving unobservable entities:

generate implications on what should be true in the observable world if
the posited mechanisms and our instruments of observation operate in the
manner that we theorize. We can test these observable implications ...
even though we cannot directly observe mechanisms.

This could have been written by a constructive empiricist, rather than a
proponent of SR, for to test the observable implications of a theory
that postulates an unobservable entity is precisely to test its
empirical adequacy. For reasons I examine later, Van Fraassen is
reluctant to embrace the term 'causal mechanism' to characterize such
entities. Constructive [**empiricism** nonetheless **endorses**
scientists making unobservable entities objects of **inquiry** in the
**only way** that is **possible**]{.underline} --- by [**constructing**,
and **testing** the **empirical adequacy** of, theories that **invoke**

\[\[Title\]\]

Yet this trivial episode invites us to think seriously about the role of
covert intervention and regime change in U.S. policy. [Just as the U.S.
sought to **undermine** or topple **unfriendly regimes** during the Cold
War, it may **look** to such methods **again** in its increasingly
heated **rivalry** with **China**]{.underline}. Caution will be
necessary: History tells us that while covert intervention can sometimes
be a cost-effective tool of competition, it is fraught with risks and
profound moral trade-offs.

Covert action came of age [during the **Cold War**]{.underline}. In the
late 1940s, when [the **CIA**]{.underline} and National Security Council
were born, the U.S. began developing a global capability for
intervention under the cloak of secrecy. Over the succeeding decades, it
[would seek to **destabilize** or replace numerous **governments** that
were **slipping** into the Soviet sphere]{.underline} or softening up
their countries for communist influence. [The U.S. **didn't** do this
**gratuitously**]{.underline}, or to protect American investments
overseas. [Washington resorted to covert action because its **leaders
believed** that the **geopolitical balance** was **fragile** and that
the U.S. **needed affordable** methods of **competing** along a nearly
**global periphery**. And because **waging** that struggle against a
**ruthless enemy** in an often-unstable Third World might require
**fighting dirty**, America must be able to do so in **quiet**,
non-attributable **ways**]{.underline}.

The CIA successfully overthrew, or helped overthrow, governments in
Guatemala and Iran in the 1950s. It prosecuted a shadowy struggle from
Central America to southern Africa to Afghanistan through the end of the
1980s. In most cases, the U.S. subverted communist or other unfriendly
authoritarian regimes, but it also targeted democratically
elected leaders such as Chile's Salvador Allende, who were seen as
taking the wrong side in the Cold War. "We are facing an implacable
enemy whose avowed objective is world domination," a classified report
on CIA operations concluded in 1954. "There are no rules in such a game.
Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply."

Yet that same statement showed why covert action felt awkward --- even
morally reprehensible --- to many Americans. The CIA suffered severe
blowback in the 1970s, when revelations of its role in Chile and its
efforts to assassinate foreign leaders came to light.

After the Cold War, covert intervention receded in importance. According
to published reports, the U.S. sought covert options for toppling the
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and other sworn enemies. Absent the Soviet
threat, however, the geopolitical imperatives of competing for influence
everywhere became less pressing.

[Meanwhile, the spread of **democracy** and the rise of **overt tools**
for **promoting** it, such as the quasi-autonomous National Endowment
for Democracy, gave the U.S. less **morally ambiguous** ways of shaping
political **outcomes**]{.underline}. Why send spooks to influence an
election in Georgia or Ukraine when Washington could send
nongovernmental groups and election monitors instead? As Allen
Weinstein, a founder of the National Endowment for Democracy, said, "A
lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA."

[It's **not so easy** anymore. American officials can **no longer
assume** the inevitable emergence of a **friendlier**, more
**democratic** world. U.S. **competition** with **China**]{.underline}
(and, to a lesser degree, Russia) [is intensifying and **sprawling**
geographically. A few **years** from now, Washington might find itself
**desperately** seeking **covert options** to prevent some important
country in sub-Saharan **Africa**, the **Middle East** or Southeast
**Asia** from **aligning** with **Beijing**.]{.underline}

If that seems far-fetched, [consider how much the **U.S.-China rivalry**
has **escalated** over the past three years, and where that
**trajectory** might lead in another **decade**]{.underline}. Or
remember that U.S. policymakers of the late 1940s probably never
imagined that America would wage a complex covert struggle over Angola a
quarter-century later. One timeless rule of international politics is
that [strategic **competition** takes countries **places** they may
**not** initially **expect**]{.underline}, or want, to go.

But is covert intervention a good idea? Some analysts argue that it
rarely works and should be avoided, yet this is probably the wrong
standard. Countries usually resort to covert action when other options
have either failed or are deemed undesirable, so the likelihood of
success is low to begin with. That built-in handicap notwithstanding,
the U.S. did, in some cases, get serious strategic mileage out of its
meddling.

In the late 1940s, covert support for democratic politicians in Italy
played a modest but probably important role in shoring up that country
against communist challenges at the polls. For the cost of a few hired
mobs, the U.S. facilitated the toppling of Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh of Iran in 1953, securing its strategic flank in the Persian
Gulf for 25 years. CIA support helped the Indonesian
military consolidate power after it toppled an increasingly
anti-American Sukarno in 1965, thus avoiding the prospect of Southeast
Asia's most important country turning hostile.

During the 1970s, when the Third World was convulsed by ideological
radicalism and the U.S. was experiencing its post-Vietnam hangover,
covert action was critical to holding the line. Finally, in the 1980s,
the Reagan administration used a wide-ranging covert offensive to
put intense pressure on Soviet clients in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and
Angola, and to drive up the costs of Moscow's global presence. Without
covert action, America might not have won the Cold War.

Unfortunately, some of [these **examples** also tell a **darker
story**]{.underline}. By aiding the Indonesian military in 1965, [the
U.S. **implicated** itself in **horrific violence**]{.underline} that
killed half a million people. The price the U.S. ultimately paid for
conspiring against Mossadegh and backing the shah of Iran was measured
in the enmity of the anti-American regime that took power in 1979. [The
U.S. supported some **decent people** fighting against Communist regimes
in the **1980s**, and some **truly awful** ones as well]{.underline},
including some who would go on to play an important role in a blossoming
international jihad. And in destabilizing Allende's regime in the early
1970s, the U.S. helped extinguish Chilean democracy for nearly two
decades.

The nature of covert intervention is that it is difficult to be choosy
in one's partners or their methods, which can create a moral mess for a
democratic superpower. A sense that almost anything would be better than
ascendant communism led the U.S. to embrace expedients --- authoritarian
regimes, efforts to kill foreign leaders such as Patrice Lumumba in the
Congo or Fidel Castro in Cuba --- that were ugly. When that happened,
covert action could become a cause of anti-Americanism in the Third
World rather than a solution for it.

Not least, because covert operations are high-risk endeavors, they can
backfire spectacularly. The U.S. created some of its own problems in
Indonesia in the 1950s by trying, and failing, to spur a separatist
movement against Sukarno's government. The Bay of Pigs fiasco in
1961 pushed Castro to undertake a covert offensive of his own, meant to
overthrow U.S. allies in Latin America. It also caused Nikita Khrushchev
to deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba, leading to the most dangerous crisis
of the Cold War.

[One **tragedy** of geopolitical **rivalry** is that it often presents
**great powers** with **unappealing** choices. The alternative to a
**bad outcome** may be one that is **worse**, both **morally** and
strategically. That's why the U.S. so often **resorted** to
behind-the-scenes **intervention** in the Cold War, and why it may prove
useful in the future]{.underline}. But history shows that covert action
is no cure-all for a country's geopolitical challenges. In some cases,
it can produce tragedies of its own.

order** as an **empire**]{.underline}. In our rendering, [the **U**nited

American foreign policy for the evolution of the international system,
and we do not in this confined treatment offer an explanation for the
origins of U.S. foreign policy. In short, we offer an argument about
impacts rather than the sources of America's anti-imperial and
pro-Westphalian role.

Empires and State Systems: Historical Patterns

Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world
politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no
global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent
imperial and colonial ventures connected desperate regional systems,
doing so approximately five hundred years ago.7 Prior to this emergence
of a global scope system, the pattern of world politics was
characterized by regional systems. These regional systems were initially
very anarchic, and marked by high levels of military competition. But
almost universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires
which had fairly limited interactions with polities outside their
regions.8 Thus, it was empires -- not anarchic state systems -- that
typically dominated the regional systems in all parts of the world.

Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order
was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.
Despite repeated efforts to consolidate Europe into one empire -- or
what the Europeans referred to as "universal monarchy" -- this region
remained a plural, multi-state political order. After the Peace of
Westphalia ending the Thirties Year War, this plural anarchic system,
the Westphalian system, and was sustained by a rough balance of power
among its autonomous states and the weakness of the claimants of
European empire. This Westphalian system was based on a roughly equal
distribution of power among its major units, sustained by various
balancing practices that thwarted a succession of regional European
empire-builders, and had an elaborate system of public international law
and ideological justification.9 While this system rested on a balance of
power, it was juridically crystallized into a system of mutually
recognized sovereigns.

Outside of Europe, however, the European states, including those that
were most active in preventing empire within Europe, were
extraordinarily successful in conquering and colonizing vast areas
across oceanic distances.10 The Europeans did not invent empire, but
they were spectacularly successful at empire building on a global scope,
largely because of the imbalance of power that stemmed from European
innovations in technology and organization.11 The Europeans conquered
and dominated empires, states, and peoples in every previously loosely
coupled or isolated regional system across the world. The Europeans also
successfully planted numerous colonies of settlers, mainly in the
temperate zones in North and South America, Oceania, and the southern
tip of Africa.12 States from the Western European core of the
Westphalian system thus brought into existence a global-scale political
system made up of vast multi-continental empires of conquered peoples
and a scattering of colonial "new Europes."13

This pattern of European empire building was different from its
predecessors, not just in its global scope, but also because the
European states were continuously warring against one another for
dominance within Europe. These struggles between states within Europe
against empire in Europe were fought on a global scale. Thus the first
"world war," defined as a war fought across multiple continents,
occurred in the later 18th century. In this struggle Britain sought to
thwart French attempts to dominate Europe and the battle lines were in
Europe, North America, South Asia, and across the global oceans. This
pattern of the globalization of intra-European warfare continued in the
20th century with the wars triggered by German efforts to dominate
Europe. The growing imbalance of power between the Europeans and the
rest of the world during the 18th and 19th century enabled the Europeans
to easily expand their empires at the expense of non-Europeans. But
during the same periods, the Europeans found it very difficult to
conquer each other within Europe. Thus vast armies wrought great
destruction fighting over tiny parcels of land in Europe, while
comparatively small European imperial expeditionary forces readily
mastered non-European armies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Thus a
balance of power underpinned the Westphalian system in Europe, while an
imbalance of power between Europe and the world underpinned imperial
expansion.

Anti-imperial and anti-colonial rebellions and resistance are as old as
empires, but successful rebellion against European imperial rule outside
Europe began in the 18th century with the revolt of the colonial settler
colonies in the Americas -- first in North America and then in South
America. This first wave of settler-colony rebellion marked the end of
what historians refer to as the "first British empire," as well as the
first great European empire in the Americas, that of Spain. The success
of this first wave of anti-imperial rebellion in Spanish America was
crucially facilitated by the weakening of Spain during the Napoleonic
wars for domination within Europe.

In the later-19th century, European empire building outside of Europe
entered a second wave, enabled by the new industrial technologies that
further amplified the imbalance of power between Europeans and
non-Europeans, which in turn allowed the Europeans to extend their
imperial domination into the large interior spaces of the continents,
particularly in Africa and Asia.14 In the 20th century, further wars
among the core European states weakened Britain, France, and Holland,
the leading European colonial powers, thus creating opportunities for
anti-imperial independence movements in Asia and Africa. Paradoxically,
the fact that the Europeans were continuously fighting one another
fueled their imperial ambitions and successes, while at the same time,
such wars weakened them and helped enable the success of rebellions
against their empires.15 Thus as the British empire was reaching its
territorial zenith in the early years of the 20th century, Britain was
critically weakened by the world wars in Europe and Asia against the
aspiring German and Japanese empire builders.

The territorial aggression of the Axis Powers constitute a third wave of
empire building which was short lived and thwarted by the successful
mobilization of the "United Nations," a coalition led by the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. A fourth wave of
empire building, by the Soviet Union and the international communist
movement in the second half of the 20th century, was thwarted and
dismantled by the United States and its allies.

The Pattern of American Anti-Imperial, Anti-Colonial, and
Pro-Westphalian Impacts

[Against the backdrop of this evolution]{.underline} of the
international system [and the **four waves** of empire **building** and
**dismantlement**, it becomes possible to see more **clearly** the many
ways in which the **U**nited **S**tates played important
**anti-imperial**, anti-**colonial**]{.underline}, and pro-Westphalian
[roles]{.underline}. 16

[In **each** of the four **waves** of empire building and dismantlement,
the **U**nited **S**tates had an **impact**]{.underline}. The United
States was the first "new nation" to emerge from a rebellion against
European imperial rule during the first wave of modern empire. [The
**U**nited **S**tates also supported the **independence** of other
European **settler colonies**]{.underline} throughout the Americas and,
[with the **Monroe Doctrine**, helped **sustain** their **independence**
against **European** efforts to **recolonize** parts of the
**Americas**]{.underline}. In the second wave of late 19th century
empire-building, [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, despite its
great relative power, [did **not establish** an **empire** of its
own]{.underline} of any significance or duration. And during the latter
part of the 20th century, [the **U**nited **S**tates pushed European
**decolonization**, thus **facilitating** the breakup of second wave
empires. In the great **world wars** in the 20th century, the **U**nited
**S**tates played an important **role** in thwarting a third wave of
**imperial projects** of **Germany**, Japan, and **Italy**]{.underline}.
In the second half of the 20th century, the United States played
decisive roles, both ideological and military, in thwarting the fourth
wave of empire building, the expansion of the communist great power, the
Soviet Union, as well as communist coups and revolutions in many weak
and small independent states.

The United States also played a variety of important roles in building
and strengthening Westphalian institutions, moderating inter-state
anarchy, and facilitating the ability of states to survive as
independent members of international society. From its inception, the
United States was precocious in its [support for the **law of nations**,
the **institutions** of the society of states, particularly the **laws
of war** and neutrality, and public **international law**, as a means of
**restraining war** and aggression]{.underline}. In both the 19th and
20th centuries, [the **U**nited **S**tates, first regionally and then
globally, **inspired** and helped legitimate **anti-colonial** and
anti-imperial independence **movements** and national **liberation
struggles** among **peoples** struggling against empires **all over the
world**]{.underline}. In the 20th century, the United States led the
efforts to institutionalize Westphalian norms of non-aggression and
sovereign independence, first with the League of Nations and then with
the United Nations Charter. In the second half of the 20th century, the
American-led liberal international order institutionalized free trade
and multilateral cooperation, thus providing the infrastructure for a
global economic system, thus enabling smaller and weaker states to
sustain their sovereign. Also in the second half of the 20th century,
[the **American** system of military **alliances** contributed to the
**dampening** of violent **conflicts** among allied states, particularly
in **Europe** and **East Asia**, thus protecting the **Westphalian**
system from the return of violent conflict and
**empire-building**.]{.underline}

Taken together, [these]{.underline} varied American [activities in the
world **clearly** provide strong preliminary **evidence** for our
**claim** that the **U**nited **S**tates has significantly contributed
to the **dismantlement** of **empires**]{.underline}, the thwarting of
further empire-building, and to the universalization,
institutionalization, and stabilization of the Westphalian state-system.

#### 2. If it [does result]{.underline} in global presence, that engagement is [voluntary]{.underline} and [liberally beneficial]{.underline} for partner countries.

Power," Hoover Institution,

\[\[Figure omitted\]\]

The global scope of American military power has been described in many
ways: [**hegemony**, primacy, and unipolarity]{.underline}. Brooks,
Ikenberry, and Wohlforth (2012)1 cover the nuances of the terminology
well, and I agree with their preference for the term "Deep Engagement"
that Joseph Nye coined in a 1995 article.2 The complex patterns and
nuances of engagement [remain **poorly understood**, with a focus on
**conflict** that ignores the **preponderance** of cases, where U.S.
forces have been **peacefully based** for decades]{.underline}. In
short, [foreign policy has focused on the **heat** instead of the
**light** -- countless **studies**, essays, and books on Vietnam,
Afghanistan, and **Iraq** stand in **contrast** to the negligible
**attention** given to countries where the U.S. maintained
**large-scale** and long-term **troop basing** such as Belgium,
**Korea**, Turkey, and **Kuwait**.]{.underline}

[Is the **U**nited **S**tates an **empire?** We **may** just **as well**
debate **whether** an **elephant** most closely **resembles** a
**T**yrannosaurus **Rex**]{.underline} or Triceratops. Some will point
to the imperial characteristics that are reflected in the United States
force posture.  But [characteristics of]{.underline} dinosaurs or
**[empires]{.underline}** (size, martial strength, breadth) really [have
**no meaning** in a world where that entire **order** is
**extinct**]{.underline}.  The 21st century is filled with a new order
of nation-states, markedly different from eras prior to 1945. 

American power is best understood not by its type: hard, soft, or smart,
but its motivation. This is not to say the "imperial" motivation has
disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and domination are
instinctive human qualities.  But there is a new aspect to international
relations that has been in place for more than a century, a form of
altruism, illustrated by the widespread support that exists in the U.S.
and other countries for universal human rights. For many decades now,
nations have routinely sought to advance something beyond their narrow
national interests. I call this a Promethean motivation, and America a
Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus -- repeatedly -- in order to help uplift the human race.

[Critics of American **intervention** reflexively use the term
"**imperial**" when discussing **foreign affairs**]{.underline}. By far
the dominant theme of imperialism in American foreign policy has been
voiced by Leftist thinkers such as Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce Kolko,
and Gore Vidal. But since 1990, the end of the Cold War,
[neo-**isolationists** on the **right** have **adopted** the term as
well]{.underline}, notably Pat Buchanan and Congressman Ron Paul. Thus
the tendency is for thinkers on the political extremes -- globalists on
the left, nationalists on the right -- to find common cause, whereas
centrists tend to view American power more favorably, as do many foreign
scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power."  The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." Hegemony refers to a coercive state, like an empire, but one
that aims to create mutually beneficial relationships. Trying to define
the nature of state power by the distribution of benefits (exploitative
or shared) misses the point. The point is: what are first principles
that motivate foreign action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. 
Consider again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more
than a poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James
Madison, "I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well
calculated as ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of
his final letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this
progress will stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been
receding before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I
trust, disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the advantage of the
empire and at the cost of the foreigners. And for the sake of clarity,
recognize a bright line that distinguishes imperial relationships as
those where subjugated peoples do not want but are forced to abide by
foreign intervention.  To be specific, [the U.S. **role** in South
**Korea** fails the **imperial test**, as does the post-1955 role of the
U.S. in **Germany** and **Japan**. Those three countries **accounted**
for nearly **three-quarters** of U.S. troop **deployments** since 1950.
Not to mention **Spain**, Turkey, **Taiwan**, and **Kuwait**. All of
these are **voluntary alliances**]{.underline}, and qualitatively
distinct from forces based in Iraq.

[For the Leftist **criticism** of American **empire** to hold, evidence
of **domination** should be **easy** to see]{.underline}. One would
expect to see the countries of the world that are occupied by American
troops suffering economic decline as a result, or at a minimum
a relative decline.  [Here **the critique falls** apart. The countries
of the world that have **hosted** the greatest number of American
**troops** since 1950 have **grown** the **fastest** economically.
Furthermore, **host countries** have experienced faster **declines** in
child **mortality**, faster **increase** in overall **longevity**,
faster growth in **infrastructure**, and even greater **improvements**
in the broadly measured **human development** index]{.underline} (HDI).
Consider as evidence the average economic growth rates presented in
table 2, reproduced from Jones and Kane (2012).4Table 2. Annual growth
rate effect of U.S. Troops, by host country GDP per capita level in 1960
and size of troop deployment during 1950-2000.

\[\[Figure omitted\]\]

The record shows that [America's **engagement** with allied nations is
**unequivocally beneficial** for those countries]{.underline}. But the
context is what matters for future policy choices. [Public
**perceptions** of world affairs are dominated by **negatives**:
bombings in Iraqi **cities**, AIDS rampant in Africa,
**genocides**]{.underline}, earthquakes. Foreign policy experts focus on
negatives of a subtler nature: the dilemma over Iran's pursuit of
nuclear weapons, the poppy trade and corruption in Afghanistan, the
strategic mystery that is China. [Yet **despite** real and looming
**crises**, the underlying **theme** of the American century is a
**patient** march of human **prosperity**, deepening and broadening as
economic **growth unfolds** in the free world.]{.underline}

The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S. troops,
even and especially when it is not self-interested, has benefitted our
allies and the world. America's engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945
created a security umbrella fostering peace and unprecedented
prosperity. If this model were applied to the Middle East -- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters -- it would reshape the region's
future for the better. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[The **question**]{.underline} that haunts contemporary foreign policy
[is **not** whether the U.S. **military** is a force for **good** around
the globe. **It is**. The question is: Can Promethean power **be
sustained**?]{.underline} Does the United States have the willpower to
maintain a forward force posture?

#### 3. BUT no impact\-\--hegemony doesn't cause global interventions or presence.

**Mazarr 20**, is a senior political scientist at the RAND corporation.
(Michael, Summer 2020, "Rethinking Restraint: Why It Fails in Practice,"
Elliot School of International Affairs, *The Washington Quarterly,* Vol.
32, Article 2, 7--32)

[Nor can US]{.underline} involvement in [foreign **wars** and
**interventions** usually be traced to a **hegemonic** desire to spread
**liberal values**]{.underline}. A missionary attitude in foreign policy
and liberal value promotion agenda may help lay the groundwork or
justify the public case for unnecessary commitments and may be
responsible for a few of them. [**But** the largest
**interventions**---Korea, **Vietnam**, the **Gulf War**, the Balkan
wars, **Afghanistan**, and **Iraq**---were all **primarily motivated**
by security considerations]{.underline}.19 [Some of these]{.underline}
actions [**may** have been **excessive** to begin with or become
so]{.underline} over time, [and the]{.underline} security [**concerns**
that drove them may have been based on **bad info**rmation or **inflated
fears**. But they were **not fueled** by the boundless commitment to
**primacy** and **liberal value** promotion]{.underline} described by
many advocates of restraint.

Limits to Ambition: By the Numbers

Broadly speaking, then, [the **default setting** of US foreign policy is
**hardly** one of fervent interventionism]{.underline}. In terms of
actual military posture and spending, if the United States had truly
embraced hegemonic policies, there would be a trajectory of continually
rising commitments, military spending, and interventions since 1945. Yet
the actual record is starkly different. Table 1 tells an interesting
story about one key focus of the restraint proponents---global military
presence.

[Between the late 19**80s** and roughly **2018**, US troop levels
**declined**]{.underline} slightly in Japan, more than 40 percent in
Korea, and 80 percent in Europe. [The result was that]{.underline}, as
the Pew Research Center put it, by 2016 [the "U.S. military **overseas**
presence \[was\] at a **60-year low**," falling well **below 200,000**
after having reached a peak of **1.2 million**]{.underline} in the late
1960s and remaining at over 600,000 as recently as 1990. In 2016, only
15 percent of active-duty US military troops were deployed
overseas---the lowest proportion since 1957.21

[One partial **exception** to this trend, of course, is the **Middle
East**]{.underline}, where after a history of "extremely light force
presence" 22 before 1990, US regional deployments expanded across the
region in the wake of the Gulf War and ramped up dramatically during the
Iraq War. Various factors---including the flow of units into and out of
the region, the use of private contractors to fulfill some functions,
and limits on public information---make it impossible to put a precise
figure on US deployments; the Congressional Research Service has
estimated that as of 2019, there were 60,000 to 80,000 US troops in the
Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility.23 [Yet **even here**,
these numbers are **well down** from the recent peak: the **Obama**
administration's **withdrawal** of most US combat **forces** from Iraq
meant that **numbers** there **plummeted**.]{.underline}

from over 160,000 in 2006-- 07 to residual levels by 2012.24

The story of [US defense **spending** from **1988** to **9/11** is also
one of **gradual decline**]{.underline}. All told, "inflation-adjusted
military spending fell by one-third in the 1990s." 25 [The defense
budget shows]{.underline} a similar pattern over a longer time
period---[a downward slope from]{.underline} about [16 percent of
GDP]{.underline} in the early 1950s [to **less** than **3
percent**]{.underline} by the end of the 1990s, and then, [after a bump
from **9/11** and the **war on terror**, back down]{.underline} to 3.1
percent in 2018.26 (Even before the current pandemic, the Congressional
Budget Office had projected a further decline to 2.8 percent of GDP by
2029.27) [The **U**nited **S**tates **also** took advantage of the end
of the Cold War to **slash** its nuclear **arsenal** from a peak of
**31,255** weapons to **fewer** than **5,000**]{.underline}.28

Therefore, had [an advocate of **restraint**]{.underline} called [in
**1989**]{.underline} for a one-third cut in defense spending, an 80
percent reduction in troops in Europe, and an 85 percent cut in the US
nuclear arsenal, they [would have gotten **everything** they asked
for]{.underline}. Restraint proponents would doubtless suggest that
spending remains too high and that US global posture---with hundreds of
bases and deployments across dozens of countries---remains too
elaborate. Both may be true, and further cuts may be called for. But
[the **record** of US foreign policy does **not reflect** a one-way
trajectory of **defense** posture and **spending** in service of
**primacy** and liberal **hegemony**]{.underline}.

The only problem with this argument is that every component of it is
wrong. [The **foreign policy** establishment is **not a closed cabal**,
American **statecraft** has **not** been a giant
**failure**]{.underline}, and scrapping professionalism for amateurism
would be a disaster. In truth, the [foreign policy]{.underline}
establishment [is an American **strength** rather than weakness. It is
more **open-minded** and **accountable** than its critics
allow]{.underline}. It acts as a storehouse of accumulated professional
wisdom, providing intellectual ballast to the ship of state. On balance,
[the establishment's practical **track record** has been **impressive**,
with some well-known **fiascos outweighed** by many quiet **successes**.
And the current administration's foreign policy **blunders**---including
in its response to the current **pandemic**---demonstrate what happens
when the establishment's **experience** and expertise are
**rejected**]{.underline}. In short, the Blob is not the problem. It is
the solution.

A CONTENTIOUS CLUB

Blob theorists view the establishment as a club of like-minded elite
insiders who control everything, take care of one another, and brush off
challenges to conventional wisdom. In reality, [the **U**nited
**S**tates actually has a **healthy market**place of foreign policy
ideas. Discussion over American foreign **policy** is loud, contentious,
**diverse**, and generally **pragmatic**---and as a result, the nation
gets the opportunity to **learn** from its **mistakes**]{.underline},
build on its successes, and improve its performance over time.

In both absolute and relative terms, [the expert community]{.underline}
dealing with foreign policy and national security [in the **U**nited
**S**tates is remarkably large and **heterogeneous**]{.underline}.
Inside government, cadres of professionals make vast amounts of
technocratic knowledge and institutional memory available to
policymakers. Every department and agency with an international role has
distinctive regional or functional expertise it can bring to bear. [This
inhouse **knowledge** is complemented by an even **larger** and more
diverse **network** of experts]{.underline} in the many hundreds of
think tanks and contract research institutions [that **surround** the
government and offer views ranging from **right** to **left**, hawk to
dove]{.underline}, free trader to protectionist, [technocratic to
ideological]{.underline}. Pick any policy issue and you can put together
a lively debate with ease. Should the United States engage with China or
contain it? Negotiate with Iran or squeeze it? Withdraw from the Middle
East or redouble its efforts? Reasoned arguments on all sides are widely
available, in any form you want---all supplied from within the
supposedly monolithic establishment.

Moreover, unlike such communities in other leading powers, the American
foreign policy establishment is connected to society rather than cut off
from it, because the top several layers of U.S. national security
bureaucracies are staffed by political appointees rather than civil
servants. The Blob comprises government officials, outside experts, and
many people who go back and forth between the two. Insiders know how
government works and what is practical. Outsiders think independently.
And in-and-outers bridge the gaps. Other countries simply do not have
comparably large, diverse, permeable, expert communities that encourage
[vigorous **debate** over national **policy**---which is why, say, the
caliber of U.S. debate about nuclear policy is **more nuanced** and
better **informed** than in other nuclear **powers**]{.underline}, and
which is why other countries would love to have such a Blob of their
own.

[The American **foreign policy** establishment]{.underline}, finally,
[is generally **more pragmatic** than ideological]{.underline}. It
values prudence and security over novelty and creativity. It knows that
thinking outside the box may be useful in testing policy assumptions,
but the box is usually there for a reason, and so reflexively embracing
the far-out option is dangerous. Its members have made many mistakes,
individually and collectively, but several features of the system
enforce accountability over time. [Foreign **policy
failures**]{.underline}, for example, [are politically **toxic** and
often **spur positive change**]{.underline}. The [monumental
intelligence **failures** that allowed the **September 11**
attacks]{.underline} to happen [were followed by policy and
**institutional reforms**]{.underline} that have helped prevent other
mass-casualty terrorist attacks on U.S. targets for almost two decades.
Early [misjudgments in the **Iraq war** led to the adoption of a **new**
counterinsurgency **strategy** that restored stability]{.underline}, at
least for a while. The international economic imbalances and financial
procedures that led to the 2008 global financial crisis were addressed
by policies that contributed to a decade-long recovery.

Taken together, these virtues reinforce one another and help the United
States tackle the countless national and global challenges that confront
a superpower. Blob critics claim there are no meaningful arguments over
U.S. foreign policy. But this is just not true. [Intense **disputes**
over the **Korea**n War, the **Vietnam** War, détente and **arms
control**, the opening to **China**, and policies in **Central America**
and the **Middle East** were followed by **battles** over **the Gulf**
War, **NATO** expansion, military **interventions** in Haiti,
**Somalia**, and the **Balkans**, and the wars in Afghanistan and
**Iraq**---not to mention heated **arguments** over positions toward
**China**, Iran, North Korea, **Russia**]{.underline}, and other issues
today. It is true that beneath all this controversy lies a relatively
stable consensus on the value of power, alliances, and constructive
global engagement. Most members of the establishment believe that global
problems usually improve when the United States engages responsibly and
worsen when the United States retreats. Yet that reflects not some
nefarious groupthink but the wisdom of professional crowds, arrived at
through painful trial and error over more than a century.

**Ravenal 9**, Professor Emeritus, Georgetown University School of
Foreign Service (Earl C. Ravenal, 2009, "WHAT'S EMPIRE GOT TO DO WITH
IT? THE DERIVATION OF AMERICA'S FOREIGN POLICY," Critical Review, Vol.
21, No. 1, pp. 21-75, University of Kansas Libraries, Taylor and
Francis)

[The underlying notion of "the **security bureaucracies** . . . looking
for new **enemies**" is a **threadbare** concept]{.underline} that has
somehow taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical left
(viz. Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the
liberal center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most
alleged "threats" as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted
Galen Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy
of the Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies).
[What is **missing** from most analysts' claims of "**threat
inflation**," however, is a **convincing theory** of why, say, the
American government significantly]{.underline} (not merely in excusable
rhetoric) [might **magnify** and even **invent threats**]{.underline}
(and, more seriously, act on such inflated threat estimates).

In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) suggests that such behavior might
stem from military or national security bureaucrats' attempts to enhance
their personal status and organizational budgets, or even from the
influence and dominance of "the military-industrial complex"; viz.:
"Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback from that
empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial
complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section:

In the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises" to satisfy
parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
projects--- a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182)

Thus, "bureaucratic-politics" theory, which once made several
reputations (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary.

So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory, "public choice,"6 which can
be considered the right-wing analog of the "bureaucratic-politics"
model, and is a preferred interpretation of governmental decision-making
among libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes:

Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the government itself can develop
separate interests from its citizens. The government reflects the
interests of powerful pressure groups and the interests of the
bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although this problem occurs
in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more severe in foreign
policy because citizens pay less attention to policies that affect them
less directly.

There is, in this statement of public-choice theory, a certain
ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: Bureaucrats are
supposedly, at the same time, subservient to societal interest groups
and autonomous from society in general.

This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups---about what
strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.

Ironically, "public choice"---not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation---is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub-rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives.

My treatment of "role" differs from that of the bureaucratic-politics
theorists, whose model of the derivation of foreign policy depends
heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and specific identification of
the roleplaying of organizationally situated individuals in a partly
conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that "results in" some policy
outcome. Even here, bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and
Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some players are not able to
articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics game because their
conception of their job does not legitimate such activity." This is a
crucial admission, and one that points--- empirically---to the need for
a broader and generic treatment of role.

Roles (all theorists state) give rise to "expectations" of performance.
[My point is that **virtually every** governmental **role**, and
especially **national-security** roles]{.underline}, and particularly
the roles of the uniformed military, [**embody** expectations
of]{.underline} devotion to the "national interest"; [**rationality** in
the derivation of policy at every functional level; and **objectivity**
in the treatment of parameters, **especially** external parameters such
as "**threats**"]{.underline} and the power and capabilities of other
nations.

Sub-rational models (such as "public choice") fail to take into account
even a partial dedication to the "national" interest (or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more parochial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the (perhaps
otherwise) self-seeking impulses of the individual. [Role-derived
**behavior** tends to be **formalized** and **codified**; relatively
**transparent** and at least **peer-reviewed**, so as to be consistent
with expectations]{.underline}; surviving the particular individual and
transmitted to successors and ancillaries; [measured **against** a
standard and thus **corrigible**]{.underline}; defined in terms of the
performed function and therefore derived from the state function; and
uncorrrupt, because personal cheating and even egregious aggrandizement
are conspicuously discouraged.

My own direct observation suggests that [defense **decision-makers**
attempt to "**frame**" the structure of the **problems** that they try
to solve on the **basis** of the most **accurate
intelligence**]{.underline}. They make it their business to know where
the threats come from. [Thus, threats are not "socially
**constructed**"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are).

[A major reason for the **rationality**, and the **objectivity**, of the
process is that **much** security **planning** is done]{.underline}, not
in vaguely undefined circumstances that offer scope for idiosyncratic,
subjective behavior, but rather [in **structured** and **reviewed**
organizational frameworks. Non-rationalities]{.underline} (which are bad
for understanding and prediction) [tend to **get filtered out**. People
are **fired** for presenting **skewed analysis** and for making bad
predictions. This is because **something important** is riding on the
causal **analysis**]{.underline} and the contingent prediction.

For these reasons, "public choice" does not have the "feel" of reality
to many critics who have participated in the structure of defense
decision-making. In that structure, obvious, and even not-so-obvious,
["**rent-seeking**" would]{.underline} not only be shameful; it would
[present a **severe risk** of career **termination**]{.underline}. And,
as mentioned, the defense bureaucracy is hardly a productive place for
truly talented rent-seekers to operate, compared to opportunities for
personal profit in the commercial world. A bureaucrat's very
self-placement in these reaches of government testifies either to a
sincere commitment to the national interest or to a lack of sufficient
imagination to exploit opportunities for personal profit.

The Shift to Great Power Competition

[The cracks in **liberal** internationalist **hopes** widened
during]{.underline} President Barack [Obama's terms]{.underline} in
office [as the **reality** of China's unchanging **nature set
in**]{.underline}. President [Obama took office believing]{.underline}
the [**U**nited **S**tates could **cooperate** with China
on]{.underline} issues in which the President believed both nations had
a shared global responsibility, such as the 2008-09 [**econ**omic
crisis, global **warming**, and nuclear **proliferation**. However,
China posed **immediate challenges**, including increased **aggression**
in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea and opposition to U.S.-**So**uth
**Ko**rean military **exercises**]{.underline}.41 Exasperated at the
lack of progress with North Korean denuclearization, President Obama
warned Beijing that he "would have to take steps to shield the United
States from the threat of a nuclear missile attack from the North."42 In
2011, the Obama administration proposed its "pivot" to the Asia-Pacific
away from the Middle East.43 Nonetheless, U.S.-China engagement was
preserved along more pragmatic lines by avoiding linking issues
together, dealing with points of contention behind the scenes while
publicly trumpeting successes, such as cooperation on climate change.44

The Trump administration declared China to be a strategic competitor in
the 2017 National Security Strategy, stating, "after being dismissed as
a phenomenon of an earlier century, great power competition returned.
China and Russia began to reassert their influence regionally and
globally" and that "China seeks to displace the United States in the
Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic
model, and reorder the region in its favor."45 The Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue ("the Quad") among the United States, Australia,
Japan, and India was revived and joint military training exercises among
Quad members are increasingly part of its agenda. Predictably, Beijing's
Cold War-era fear of American "encirclement" resurfaced.46 President
Donald Trump also bolstered U.S. support for Taiwan, including
increasing defensive arms sales and lifting restrictions on U.S.
diplomats meeting Taiwanese government officials.47 The Biden
administration is expected to continue the trend towards competition
with China. The Interim National Security Strategic Guidance states, "We
must also contend with the reality that the distribution of power across
the world is changing, creating new threats. China, in particular, has
rapidly become more assertive. It is the only competitor potentially
capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and
technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open
international system" and stresses the U.S. commitment to the Quad
alliance.48 Recently, the Biden administration approved its first arms
sales to Taiwan.49

Implications for U.S. Security Policy

[Understanding China's **realist worldview** is key to crafting a
**strategy** that is consistent with the **U.S. interest** in sustaining
a **stable** western **Pacific**]{.underline}. Engagement will prove
difficult in areas where U.S. and Chinese strategic interests clash.
Taiwan is the "lens" through which Beijing views other security issues,
such as North Korean denuclearization. Indeed, according to academic
Andrew Scobell, it was the Taiwan Strait crises of the 1950s that
influenced the PRC's decision to develop nuclear weapons, despite having
been previously dismissive of them.50 Because of its geostrategic
importance, a hostile, independent Taiwan is perceived as a dagger aimed
at the PRC's heart, and Beijing has never ruled out using force to bring
Taiwan under its power. 51 A stable western Pacific depends on a stable
Taiwan Strait. Three broad policy approaches, each with their own
dangers, are:

• [**Accommodating** Beijing's national **security** aims]{.underline}
by abandoning Taiwan, which [would **allow** the PRC to **annex
Taiwan**]{.underline}, likely through coercive means. After securing
Taiwan, [an **emboldened** China will be better positioned to
**aggressively** assert illegal **territorial claims** in the **S**outh
and **E**ast **C**hina **S**eas, leading to greater **instability** in
the **Pacific**]{.underline}.52 Furthermore, [appeasing Beijing risks
undermining the **credibility** of U.S. defense commitments in the face
of **Chinese aggression**.]{.underline}

• Backing Taiwan in a bid for de jure independence, which risks war with
a China that feels it has no other recourse on the Taiwan issue.

• Sustaining the status quo whereby Taiwan is independent in all but
name, preventing Taiwan from falling under PRC control by deterring
aggression while avoiding provoking Beijing.

The risks inherent in the first two approaches make them unpalatable.
The third approach is the most viable and has been sustainable since the
passage of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) in 1979, requiring the United
States to supply defensive articles to Taiwan necessary for self-defense
and, although the TRA is not a formal defense commitment, requiring the
United States to sustain its own capabilities for defending Taiwan from
aggressive coercion. 53 However, [since the Third **Taiwan** Strait
**Crisis**, Beijing has undertaken to develop \[**A2AD**\]
anti-access/area denial capabilities that make **U.S. intervention** far
**riskier** than it was 25 years ago. Such capabilities include
**a**nti-**s**hip **b**allistic **m**issile**s**]{.underline} (AShBM)
such as the DF-21D and DF-26, [as well as new]{.underline} capabilities
such as the DF-ZF [**hypersonic** glide vehicle]{.underline} (HSGV). 54
[The **greater** the **risk** to U.S. forces, the less **credible** U.S.
intentions for intervening]{.underline} on Taiwan's behalf [will
**appear** to Beijing]{.underline}.

[Therefore, to **sustain** the **status quo**, the **U**nited **S**tates
will **have to** make China's use of force **costlier**]{.underline}
than tolerating a de facto-independent Taiwan. It should be clear to
Beijing that its only hope for Taiwan reunification is through peaceful,
noncoercive means whereby Taiwan itself chooses to unify with the
mainland. A formal commitment to Taiwan's security that leaves no doubt
in the minds of China's leaders will be necessary. [Steps to
**credibly** deter Chinese **aggression**]{.underline} in the Taiwan
Strait [include:]{.underline}

• [Reducing the **vulnerability** of U.S. **forces** in the Pacific,
particularly U.S. warships, to **missile** attack]{.underline} via
bolstering theatre missile defenses.

• [**Raising** the **cost** of aggression against Taiwan intolerably
high]{.underline} by extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella to Taiwan.

• [Reinforcing the **credibility** of U.S. defense
**commitments**]{.underline} to Taiwan by making the National Missile
Defense system capable of defending the U.S. homeland from nearpeer
missile strikes.

• Investing in the development of [new **missile**]{.underline} defense
**[technologies]{.underline}**, such as directed energy weapons and
space-based interceptors, [to counter **new missile**
threats]{.underline} (e.g., the DF-ZF HSGV).

The final two steps will require law and policymakers to have the
political will for protecting U.S. interests in the Taiwan Strait.
[Critics may **object** that these two **steps** risk starting a
so-called "**action-reaction** cycle" but]{.underline}, [**even with**
the currently limited U.S.]{.underline} missile defense [capabilities,
the **Chinese** have developed **operational** advanced **missile
systems**]{.underline}, much as the Soviet ballistic missile stockpile
continued to grow despite inhibitions regarding U.S. missile defense
development during the Cold War.55 [Artificially preserving the
**vulnerability** of the **U**nited **S**tates and its **forces** to
missile attacks will **not convince** Beijing to **forgo** valuable
"assassin's maces" such as **a**nti-**s**hip **b**allistic
**m**issile**s**]{.underline} (AShBMs) [and **HSGVs**. The PRC is
**determined** that the Fourth **Taiwan** Strait Crisis will **not be a
repeat** of the Third.]{.underline} Additionally, [defending the
**homeland** from near-peer **missile threats** has become all the
**more relevant** with the]{.underline} recent public [revelations
regarding the **construction** of multiple new Chinese missile **silo
sites**]{.underline}, reportedly intended [to house]{.underline} DF-41
intercontinental ballistic missiles (**[ICBMs]{.underline}**) equipped
with multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs),
[which]{.underline} United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) head
Admiral Charles Richard [has called a Chinese "**strategic
breakout**."]{.underline}56

Conclusion

[U.S. cooperative **engagement** with the **PRC** has **not** made the
**interests** of the **U**nited **S**tates more **secure** -- indeed,
the American "**holiday from realism**"]{.underline} (as Mearsheimer
puts it) [has made the **Pacific** more **dangerous**. Rather than
**vainly hoping** China will politically **change** in ways that
**suit** the **U**nited **S**tates, Washington should **assert** its
self-interest in the **Pacific**. A strong, clear, and credible
defense]{.underline} commitment to Taiwan\'s security [will **promote**
a stable **Pacific region**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [it will
**boost** the confidence of **U.S. allies**]{.underline}, such as Japan
-- who, recognizing Taiwan's pivotal role in regional stability, has
recently become more outspoken in defense of Taiwan's security.57
Finally, a strong defense commitment to Taiwan, a peaceful and
prosperous democracy, is also an area where realist self-interest
happily coincides with American values.

## IMPACT

### Utilitarianism Good\-\--2AC

#### Consequentialism first.

**Greene 7**, Professor, Harvard University. (Joshua D., 2007, "The
Secret Joke of Kant's Soul," in *Moral Psychology Volume 3*)

What turn-of-the-millennium science is telling us is that human moral
judgment is not a pristine rational enterprise---that our [**moral
judgments** are driven by a **hodgepodge** of **emotional
dispositions**, which]{.underline} themselves [were shaped by a
**hodgepodge** of **evolutionary forces**]{.underline}, both biological
and cultural. Because of this, [it is **exceedingly unlikely** that
there is any **rationally coherent normative** moral theory that can
**accommodate**]{.underline} our **[moral intuitions]{.underline}**.
Moreover, anyone who claims to have such a theory, or even part of one,
almost certainly does not. Instead, what that person probably has is a
moral rationalization.

It seems then that we have somehow crossed the infamous "is" "ought"
divide.14 How did this happen? Didn't Hume (1978) and Moore (1903) warn
us against trying to derive an "ought" from an "is?" How did we go from
descriptive scientific theories concerning moral psychology to
skepticism about a whole class of normative moral theories? The answer
is that we did not, as Hume and Moore anticipated, attempt to derive an
"ought" from an "is." That is, our method has been inductive rather than
deductive. We have inferred on the basis of the available evidence that
the phenomenon of rationalist deontological philosophy is best explained
as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition (Harman, 1977).

Missing the Deontological Point

I suspect that rationalist [deontologists will remain
**unmoved**]{.underline} by the arguments presented here. Instead, I
suspect, [they will insist that]{.underline} I [have simply
**misunderstood** what **Kant** and like-minded deontologists are all
about. Deontology]{.underline}, they [will say]{.underline}, isn't about
this intuition or that intuition. It's not defined by its normative
differences with consequentialism. Rather, deontology is about taking
humanity seriously. Above all else, [it's about **respect** for
**persons**]{.underline}. It's about treating others as fellow rational
creatures rather than as mere objects, about acting for reasons that
rational beings can share; and so on (Korsgaard, 1996a, 1996b).

This is, no doubt, how many deontologists see deontology. However, this
insider's view, as I have suggested, may be misleading. [The
problem]{.underline}, more specifically, [is that it **defines**
deontology in terms of **values** that are not **distinctively
deontological**]{.underline}, though they may appear to be from the
inside. Consider the following analogy with religion. When one asks a
religious person to explain the essence of his religion, one often gets
an answer like this: "It's about love, really. It's about looking out
for other people, looking beyond oneself. It's about community, being
part of something larger than oneself." This sort of answer accurately
captures the phenomenology of many people's religion, but it is
nevertheless inadequate for distinguishing religion from other things.
This is because many, if not most, nonreligious people aspire to love
deeply, look out for other people, avoid self-absorption, have a sense
of a community, and be connected to things larger than themselves. In
other words, secular humanists and atheists can assent to most of what
many religious people think religion is all about. From a secular
humanist's point of view, in contrast, what is distinctive about
religion is its commitment to the existence of supernatural entities as
well as formal religious institutions and doctrines. And they are right.
These things really do distinguish religious from nonreligious
practices, although they may appear to be secondary to many people
operating from within a religious point of view.

In the same way, I believe that most of the standard
[deontological/**Kantian** self-characterizations **fail** to
**distinguish** deontology from **other approaches** to
ethics]{.underline}. (See also Kagan, 1997, pp. 70--78, on the
difficulty of defining deontology.) It seems to me that
[consequentialists, **as much** as **anyone else**, have **respect** for
persons, are against **treating** people as mere **objects**, wish to
act for reasons that **rational creatures** can **share**, etc. A
consequentialist respects other persons and **refrains** from treating
them as **mere objects** by **counting every** person's
**well-being**]{.underline} in the decision-making process. Likewise, [a
consequentialist attempts to act according to reasons that **rational**
creatures can **share** by acting according to **principles** that give
**equal weight** to **everyone's** interests]{.underline}, i.e., [that
are **impartial**]{.underline}. This is not to say that
consequentialists and deontologists do not differ. They do. It's just
that the real differences may not be what deontologists often take them
to be.

What, then, distinguishes deontology from other kinds of moral thought?
A good strategy for answering this question is to start with concrete
disagreements between deontologists and others (such as
consequentialists) and then work backward in search of deeper
principles. This is what I have attempted to do with the trolley and
footbridge cases and other instances in which deontologists and
consequentialists disagree. [If you ask a **deontologically minded**
person why it is **wrong** to **push someone** in front of **speeding
trolley** in order to save **five others**, you will get
**characteristically deontological** answers. Some will be
**tautological**: "Because it's **murder**!"]{.underline} Others will be
more sophisticated: ["The **ends don't justify** the **means**." "You
have to **respect people's rights**."]{.underline} As we know, [these
answers **don't** really **explain anything**, because if you give the
**same people**]{.underline} (on different occasions) [the **trolley
case**]{.underline} or the loop case (see earlier discussion), [they
will make the **opposite judgment**, even though their **initial
explanation**]{.underline} concerning the footbridge case [**applies
equally** well to]{.underline} one or [**both** of these
cases]{.underline}. Talk about rights, respect for persons, and reasons
we can share are natural attempts to explain, in "cognitive" terms, what
we feel when we find ourselves having emotionally driven intuitions that
are at odds with the cold calculus of consequentialism. Although these
explanations are inevitably incomplete, there seems to be "something
deeply right" about them because they give voice to powerful moral
emotions. However, as with many religious people's accounts of what is
essential to religion, they don't really explain what is distinctive
about the philosophy in question.

#### Policies must consider [consequences]{.underline}\-\--intent and moral imperatives are [incoherent]{.underline} AND risk [further violence]{.underline}.

relations from Yale University, and current Postdoctoral Research

The Widening Lens,
https://thewideninglens.wordpress.com/2016/04/19/in-defense-of-consequentialism-a-response-to-shadi-hamid/)

My difference of opinion is fundamental: I believe most US foreign
policy to be short-sighted, and consequentialism, or the weighing of
long-term ramifications against the initial intended effect of a
particularly intervention to represent the ideal method of policymaking.
[Policies cannot **solely** be **judged** on **intention**, due to the
**frequency** with which good intentions **produce negative outcomes**,
nor can they be judged **solely** on **initial effects** due to the
**long-running causal chains** produced by **order-altering**
things]{.underline} like military interventions. However, Hamid is right
that it is impossible to foresee some ramifications (even if we can see
general correlations) of foreign policy, but he doesn't apply that
standard of doubt consistently across his analysis.

Early in the essay, Hamid makes the point that to evaluate the Libyan
intervention, it is necessary to compare the current situation with the
counterfactual: what would Libya look like if the US hadn't intervened.
In general, the assertion is correct, but the practice of
counterfactuals is tricky. Hamid's analysis of where the Libyan conflict
was at when the US intervened is enlightening, but his conclusion that
Libya would likely look like Syria today had the US not intervened is
highly questionable. Political prediction, especially on rare events
like mass atrocities or civil wars, is really, really hard. And when you
consider all the differences between Libya and Syria (total population,
population density, salience of sectarian divides, regime configuration,
military capability of opposition, etc.) along with all contingencies
that could have occurred in the past four years, it is impossible to say
with any certainty that Libya would bear a resemblance to Syria. Syria
is merely a convenient standard of comparison because it's an ongoing
civil war in the Middle East, but saying Libya would be Syria doesn't
actually tell us that much about Libya or the effects of intervention.
It's not that the intervention can't be justified with counterfactuals,
but they need to be more carefully constructed.

The central thrust of Hamid's essay is to deride what he calls
consequentialism, or evaluating the efficacy of foreign policy based on
events years after the initial intervention in the target location. For
Hamid, such an approach is particularly problematic because it a policy
cannot be retroactively deemed a mistake if the limited goal of the
intervention is achieved initially. Therefore consequentialism creates
an impossibly high bar for foreign policy decisions: unless a foreign
policy results in a peaceful, liberal democracy, than it's a failure.
This is, however, a major straw man. Certainly there are some critics
that would deem the Libyan intervention a failure based on this
standard, but Hamid lumps in those with reasonable concerns that a civil
war (likely to continue for many years based on what we know about civil
wars and foreign intervention) at least partially produced by the NATO
intervention will have more negative long-term effects on Libyans than
Gaddafi's intended repression. [**Worrying** about **consequences** does
not **preclude** making **fo**reign **po**licy decisions.
**Recognizing** that every decision has potential **positive** and
**negative effects** is **no more** than an **accurate framework** for
**analyzing** policy]{.underline}.

There are an additional two problems with Hamid's argument here. First,
[the **dismissal** of **consequentialism** is one of the **central
dynamics** that **leads** Western policymakers to **struggle** with
**conflict prevention**. Short-term thinking produces short-term
solutions. Policymakers become **trapped** in a **vicious circle** of
**continual crises** that **overwhelm** them and prevent longer-term
thinking that could go a **long way** in **preventing
violence**]{.underline}. Second, Hamid's insistence that the initial
moral righteousness of an intervention negates any negative effects, is
deeply problematic. As many before me have argued, [focusing only on
**moral imperatives** disincentives **careful planning** and allows
policymakers to **wash** their **hands** of **responsibility** if the
situation starts to go **south**]{.underline}. Evaluating military
interventions isn't personal morality, because very rarely can doing the
right thing in your personal life lead to deaths of thousands of people.
Afghanistan is a valid example. The United States was going after the
Taliban in response to 9/11 initially, but the war has had disastrous
long-term effects for the country. It would take quite a bit of chutzpah
to declare it a success.

[Moral arguments **without** strategic and humanitarian]{.underline}
(writ large) [considerations are]{.underline} also [**prone** to abuse,
because **liberal** interventionists and **neoconservatives** aren't
actually that **far apart**]{.underline}: both believe in the wisdom of
Western democracies to improve the world through military force. Without
more consequentialist standards, there's not a clear line the prevents
Iraq-like decisions. So Hamid's own argument that Obama being right
about Iraq decreases his likelihood he'll be right about other
situations is undermined by a lack of a standard that allows leaders to
tell the difference between the two.

### Alt Fails\-\--2AC

#### Their geographies studies alt fails:

#### 1. Research doesn't influence reality. 

**De Leeuw and Hunt 18**, professor @ University of Northern British
Columbia; professor @ university of Victoria. (Sarah; Sarah, 2018,
"unsettling decolonizing geographies," Geography Compass,
https://doi.org/10.1111/gec3.12376,)

Importantly, [geographers are]{.underline} also
**[decolonizing]{.underline}** the [discipline through]{.underline} the
creation of [collaborative writing and organizing practices in which
Indigenous and settler scholars work side by side in disrupting
normative power dynamics in the very spaces in which geography
reproduces itself]{.underline}. This work has included developing
decolonizing frameworks in organizing conferences which were previously
asserting criticality (centering feminist, queer, anti-capitalist,
critical race approaches) absent a significant consideration of settler
colonialism ("Decolonizing Cascadia? Rethinking Critical Geographies"
conference organizing committee, 2014). [Further, collaborative dialogue
and writing among Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars is a growing
practice in which dynamics of colonialism, decolonization, and
Indigenous resurgence can be thought through in order to make visible
some of the tensions in decolonizing work on the ground and in everyday
life]{.underline} (Holmes, Hunt, & Piedalue, 2015; Hunt & Holmes, 2015;
de Leeuw, Cameron, & Greenwood, 2012.) While some of this work is
difficult to find in standard search engines due to its circulation
among more localized networks---a purposeful effort to produce research
outcomes for the communities they are about---other publications have
been written for scholarly audiences. As discussed by Coombes, Johnson,
and Howitt (2014), unsettling community-based research and publication
with Indigenous communities requires "a new relational ethics which
unsettles any remaining binaries that survived the qualitative
revolution in human geography: Ethics becomes method; data becomes life;
landscape becomes author\' participants become family" (p. 850).
Geographers have reflected on their own relational processes for truly
shifting power of authorial voice within collaborative research (McLean,
Howitt, Colyer, Raven, & Woodward, 2016; Woodward & Marrfurra McTaggart,
2016); for example, working in the settler colonial context of
Australia, geographers Sarah Wright, Kate Lloyd, and Sandie
Suchet-Pearson have worked to center the agency of Indigenous peoples
and places by making the place itself, Bawaka Country, the lead author
in several research publications (see Bawaka Country et al., 2013, 2014,
2016). While this work is by no means complete, nor without potential
for scrutiny in the future, it does signal concrete practices meant to
disrupt normative colonial ways of thinking and being.

[Geographers **theorizing**]{.underline} and enacting what they name as
**[decolonization]{.underline}**---[especially non-Indigenous settler
geographers]{.underline}---[tend to have in common a]{.underline}
**[series of ideals]{.underline}** [that they gesture
toward]{.underline}. [Such gestures]{.underline}, however,
**[are]{.underline}** often **[still decoupled from]{.underline}**
actual **[Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**, voices, [and]{.underline}
**[places]{.underline}**: [While there may be a **stated
allegiance**]{.underline} with Indigenous communities and scholars
[sometimes things as simple as locating oneself in an active colonial
context, citing a significant number of Indigenous scholars, or
including Indigenous voices, is lacking]{.underline}. **[Non-Indigenous
geographers]{.underline}** working on decolonizing geographies
**[idealize]{.underline}** a kind of **[hybrid
scholar-activism]{.underline}** that privileges on-the-ground
anticolonial work focused on unsettling the supremacy of settler states:
Here, geographers might be participating in rallies or anticolonial
online communities; they might be protesting pipelines, organizing in
support of land defense (McCreary & Milligan, 2014; Pasternak, 2014),
working with Indigenous youth organizations or even working with other
settlers toward "culturally safe" interactions (Matthews, 1998). Still,
[it is **important** to consider the **limits** of these
**aspirational** **practices** to truly **decolonize a field** which is
largely enacted by White scholars living off the spoils of colonialism,
including **White settler scholars**, and in which Indigenous presence
is largely facilitated by, or filtered through, **non-Indigenous
"experts."**]{.underline}

**[Decolonization]{.underline}** [as it is increasingly being
deployed]{.underline} by geographers seems to [rest on ideas
about]{.underline} (and only to a very limited extent, concrete
practices for) **[building relationships]{.underline}** with Indigenous
peoples and communities while simultaneously and continuously addressing
social power formations and identity politics that have always
privileged White non-Indigenous subjects (Panelli, 2008). [These ideals
are laudable: The question becomes]{.underline}, however, **[are
geographers achieving success?]{.underline}** [Are power dynamics
shifting? Should we be thinking and acting even more critically? Is
there more we can do if we are to continue to deploy, with ever-growing
usage, the concept of decolonization? T]{.underline}o answer these
questions, we turn next to the voices and words of Indigenous activists,
scholars, artists, and thinkers, the vast majority of whom are thinking
and working in eminently geographic realms.

#### 2. Critical geographies are institutionally ineffective.

**Kinkaid 19**, post-doctoral scholar in human geographies @ university
of Delaware. (Eden, 2019, "At the limits of critical geography: Creative
interventions into the exclusionary spaces of U.S. geography," Gender,
Place & Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography, Routledge, Taylor &
Francis Group)

Having introduced select pieces from the CFVA, I will now discuss some
of the institutional difficulties encountered in advocating for their
inclusion. I will focus on dialogues surrounding two works in particular
that arose during the planning of the exhibit. Upon critical analysis,
it seems that these works were seen as potentially controversial by
virtue of the fact that they worked to disrupt institutional space,
identities, and norms, a concern that was rather ironic given the nature
of the conference. [While]{.underline} intellectual
'**[disruption]{.underline}**,' especially 'spatial disruption,' is an
effect we might expect [of]{.underline} **[critical-creative geographic
interventions]{.underline}** -- [if not the entire purpose of engaging
these approaches]{.underline} -- [it became clear that **some forms of
disruption were** seen as **acceptable** while **others** were less
'**legitimate**.']{.underline}

This potentially disruptive character of some works produced tensions in
vetting and planning the exhibit. At the time of planning, there were no
agreed upon criteria for judging artworks; it was mostly left to the
curator (the author) to organize the exhibit. As the specter of
controversial content arose, conversations occurred between the curator
and a key organizer, as well as with a departmental administrator. The
larger committee (named 'the critical geography collective') composed of
faculty and graduate students was only brought in on these conversations
toward the end of the process, specifically to make sure everyone was
'on board' for a drag performance and to approve a list and descriptions
of the works. [Thus, many of these **issues** and **decisions** were
**engaged** **outside** of the '**collective**,' **closing down**
opportunities for more sustained and **democratic** forms of **debate**
and decision-making.]{.underline}

Envisioning 'critical geographies'

At the outset of this discussion, it is worth considering how **[the
self-perception of critical geographers as 'critical']{.underline}**
[can ironically operate as an obstacle to identifying the inflection of
racism]{.underline}, sexism, homophobia, [and]{.underline} **[other
forms of oppression and exclusion]{.underline}** in this institutional
space. Ahmed aptly remarks:

> [I suspect that criticality -- the self-perception that in being
> critical we do not have a problem or **that in being critical we are
> over it** -- is often used and performed in these academic spaces. I
> have called critical racism and critical sexism this: the racism and
> sexism reproduced by those who think of themselves as **too critical
> to reproduce racism and sexism**]{.underline}. (2017, 155)

These contradictions do not go unnoticed, at least by those of us who
experience the personal and professional impacts of such lapses in
criticality. Indeed, '\[t\]his 'not translation' is something we
experience: it is a gap between a symbolic commitment and a lived
reality' (2017, 90). It is in these moments of 'not translation' that
the lines delineating what we do and do not do as critical geographers,
who we are and are not, what we challenge and what we accept, are drawn,
articulated, and reinforced. [At the most benign, I argue, when we fail
to confront these moments critically, we fail to provide models to
others of scholarship that challenges and addresses exclusionary norms,
and we fail to educate each other]{.underline}. At worst, when we do not
intervene, [we send messages to students and colleagues about what kinds
of **knowledge**]{.underline}, **[meanings]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[experience]{.underline}** [will be recognized in
the discipline, and consequently, what **kinds of bodies** and
**identities** will be recognized.]{.underline}

This is to say that seemingly minor decisions, made in the heat of the
moment or without much thought, reinforce norms that constitute the
institutional and intellectual space of the discipline. For some, these
moments are experienced as anything but minor: the confusion and
internal conflict they spawn produces a sense of bodily and intellectual
alienation that becomes a constitutive, almost ontological condition of
one's experience of institutional space as a minority subject (Puwar
2004). Yet these difficult moments might also serve as a critical
intellectual resource: '\[w\]e might work over, mull over, these
experiences; we might keep coming back to them because they do not make
sense' (Ahmed 2017, 21). [While these ideas may seem abstract or removed
from everyday institutional life, in the following analysis, I aim to
demonstrate how they are actually very concrete and how 'minor'
incidents accumulate to reproduce structures and spaces of
inequality]{.underline}.

A critical reading of the production of the exhibit illuminates how
**[particular understandings]{.underline}** [of 'critical geography'
shaped the institutional management of the exhibit, while **reinforcing
normative subject positions and marginalizing others**]{.underline}.
Here, the erratic and at times [contradictory discursive mobilizations
of the meanings of 'critical geographies', intellectual 'legitimacy',
'institutional optics', 'political climate', nonconsensual or forceful
intellectual confrontation, 'blowback', and 'family friendliness' in
relation to apparently worrisome interventions into institutional space
and disciplinary identity prove instructive for evaluating the
potentials and limitations of critical-creative geographic
scholarship.]{.underline}

Political climate' and the threat of 'blowback'

The various **[departmental reactions]{.underline}** to the prospect of
displaying artistic works in the hallways [speak to the recognized
ability of artworks to disrupt and challenge all kinds of
norms]{.underline}. In fact, [much of the discussion surrounding the
exhibit focused on]{.underline} **[managing controversies]{.underline}**
that it might produce. [One of the first questions I was asked by an
administrator (who was not otherwise involved in organizing the
conference) was whether or not the artwork would be suitable for public
consumption.]{.underline} When I asked for clarification, the question
was rephrased as '**[is it going to be family friendly?']{.underline}**
As it happened, one of the 'potentially controversial' pieces to be
discussed was a drag performance. As a queer-identified person
inhabiting a heteronormative institution, I was incapable of answering
this question: were drag queens family friendly? Are non-normatively
gendered people family friendly?

[This vague signaling of controversy accomplished through the phrase
'family friendly' can be critically read as an attempt to draw on
commonsense norms and expectations about what (and who) does and does
not belong in this institutional space]{.underline}. Even before
specific works were discussed, certain terms -- 'family friendly,'
'political climate,' and 'blowback' -- were commonsensically deployed
and set the tone of the larger conversation. For example, as a preface
to a discussion of the exhibit, the administrator argued that 'in this
political climate' we had to be careful about displaying artwork in the
hallways. [These terms were never defined or described, they merely
functioned to heighten the sense of **risk and potential controversy
that attended the prospect of engaging artwork**]{.underline}.

While most of the works in the exhibit were anything but controversial,
there were a few submissions that I felt the need to discuss in advance,
given the general sense of concern voiced by my seniors. The first such
contribution was the drag performance, which I will detail at length in
a moment. The second work was a sculpture entitled 'Redbone,' submitted
by Ciara Newton, the artist who produced Slave Money. The sculpture was
not graphic or offensive in any way: it was a large, red sculpture of a
bone. However, given the title, which could be read as 'racially
charged' (though likely would be entirely overlooked by white people), I
felt the need to contextualize the work. The sculpture was a commentary
on the artist's racial identity as a person of white, black, and
indigenous heritage. In explaining the work to me, she described an
experience as a young girl walking in a parking lot in her Midwestern
hometown and having 'redbone' shouted at her. The work, then, was a
critical commentary and redeployment. I thus explained to the
administrator that 'redbone' could function as a slur if shouted at a
person in a parking lot, but that here it was not functioning as such. I
provided the analogy of queer: if someone shouts 'queer' at a person in
a parking lot, it functions as an epithet, if a person self-describes as
queer, its meaning is different. As such, it is nonsensical and
problematic (as a group of white people) to police the use of the term
in this case. [This discussion was met with discomfort, and it was
ultimately suggested that this piece be displayed apart from the other
works in a graduate lounge, with the implicit assumption that this would
prevent people from seeing it and being offended by it.]{.underline}

Here, we can see how certain **[institutional code words function as
performatives]{.underline}**: [they serve to produce (and police) the
reality they claim to merely name]{.underline} (Butler 1990). Seemingly
innocent questions about 'family friendliness' and 'political climate'
are in fact loaded with meanings and implications; as Ahmed remarks,
'\[t\]hese questions only appear to be questions; they often work as
assertions' (2017, 117). When an unspecified 'political climate' was
commonsensically deployed to interrogate and police potentially
controversial content, 'political climate,' along with the inevitability
of 'blowback,' became a performative code word that naturalized our
individual and collective decisions about particular works. [These terms
function effectively as political tools because they are sufficiently
vague that they cannot be fully interrogated -- they assume a
common-sense meaning -- yet at the same time, they function in very
specific ways to produce consensus about institutional boundaries and
possibilities.]{.underline}

Legitimate geographies and illegitimate geographers

These concerns about 'blowback' 'political climate' and 'family
friendliness' surrounded the very idea of the exhibit, before its
specificities were even considered. However, these more diffuse concerns
about the disruptive potential of artworks particularly condensed around
one work: a proposed drag performance, which, after various discussions
and negotiations, ultimately took the form of The Future Looks Queer.
This contribution, partly by virtue of its genre and largely by virtue
of its content (or imagined content), raised particular concerns, ones
which, from the perspective of a queer person, allegorize the
heteronormative tendencies of the department's institutional and social
culture. [Accordingly, it is worth attending at length to the particular
discourses mobilized in the 'approval' of this piece.]{.underline}

[The first concern to emerge was that a drag performance could
'**delegitimize critical geography**.]{.underline}' If a drag
performance was part of the conference, [people might not take critical
geography seriously]{.underline}. In particular, [if members of the
department, who do not know much about critical geography or already
hold it in disrepute, were to encounter a drag performance, this could
further delegitimize the subfield in their eyes and make it difficult to
**advocate** for **institutional support** at the **departmental
level**]{.underline}. [It was argued that these '**institutional
optics'** did not bode well for the future of critical **geographies in
the department**.]{.underline}

The concern that queer submissions would delegitimize the discipline
were difficult to stomach, or even understand, as a queer person
studying queer geographies and cultural forms. Drag has long been a site
of analysis for scholarly work and, with the institutionalization of
geographies of sexuality and queer theory, has long ceased to be a
controversial site for academic interest. This is not to argue that such
a performance would be without potential 'blowback' or discomfort, but
that, as critical geographers, we ought to be willing to take such risks
and defend such interventions on the grounds that we are committed to
working against these exclusionary norms of institutional space.
[Regardless, to be implicitly asked to reconsider the necessity of
including a queer performance to protect the future prospects of the
subfield -- a subfield in which, by logical extension, my identity and
work are marginalized -- put me, as the curator, in an uncomfortable
position.]{.underline}

Another concern raised during discussions on the 'drag queen issue,'
revolved around the content of the performance. Indeed, concerns about
'blowback' dominated the conversation before the details of the
performance were even established or discussed. The prospect of having a
drag performance in the conference space was likened to unspecified
incidents (i.e., sex scandals?) at other universities that resulted in
the resignation of a provost and several faculty members. This reaction
was presumably in response to an expectation that the performance would
involve sexual content, though this was never directly stated. At this
point, the exact content of the performance had not been determined, as
the artist had not come to the building to explore potential performance
spaces, and any such considerations were suspended until they could be
assured that the performance would be permitted and that the exhibit
would be a safe space. Accordingly, I could not specify exactly what the
performance would entail. This lack of information did not help in
discussions about potentially controversial content, yet, even with
assurances that there would be absolutely no sexual content, discomfort
and resistance remained.

As a queer person, I can only imagine that my assurances that there
would be no inappropriate (i.e. sexual) content were ineffective because
it seemed that, for the person with this concern (a heterosexual male),
queer men in drag seemed to already necessarily express a sexual
content. Indeed, homophobia and transphobia are often sustained 'by
reading the expression of gender identity as itself a sexual act'
(Salamon 2018, 5). Here, following Ahmed, we can understand gender 'in
concrete forms of accommodation' (Ahmed 2017, 122). If we understand
that space is produced as heterosexual through particular practices
(Bell et al. 1994; Bell and Valentine 2003), the failure to accommodate
persons of non-normative genders and sexualities necessarily upholds and
reaffirms the heteronormativity of that space. [Thus, in order to
protect and accommodate problematic aspects of heterosexual, white male
gender identity, we must un-accommodate the marginalized identities that
might cause them minor discomfort or self-reflection]{.underline}. Too
often, **[the inclusion of 'diversity' in institutional spaces is meted
in this way]{.underline}**: [it is tolerated to the extent that it does
not call into question dominant identities, resulting in the
marginalization and 'affective inequality' (Rodo-De-Z arate 2017) of
bodies that disrupt (hetero)normative space.]{.underline}

Intellectual 'confrontation' and externalization

[What is most interesting (and deeply ironic) about the management of
the 'potentially controversial' art is the manner in which **space**,
**boundaries**, and even **maps**, were the **technologies** used to
**police** these works at a **critical geography
conference**]{.underline}. Space became a central issue in managing the
threat of the drag performance. The original proposal for the submission
involved several performers stationed in the elevators, who would engage
visitors, put on makeup, and improvise as visitors travelled from the
first to third floor for refreshments and to visit the exhibit. This
plan was eventually rejected because it was a violation of safety codes.
However, before that judgment was reached, various other concerns
emerged that speak directly to the management of institutional space and
intellectual boundaries.

[A major issue identified in the elevator performance scenario was that
the elevators did not belong to the department; they were used by people
on other floors of the building and we could not disrupt their
functioning]{.underline}. While this is surely reasonable, this concern
about physical safety and functionality blended easily with reoccurring
concerns about the 'content' of the performance and what would happen if
an 'inappropriately gendered' person were detected in the building. For
example, [it was argued that a student might come to the building
Saturday morning and use the elevator to get to the fifth floor to work
on their math homework. It was deemed that this hypothetical student did
not 'sign up' to encounter a drag queen, and while this moment of
unexpected encounter might be the very point of the performance, it was
seen as crossing a boundary]{.underline}. In the same discussion, one
organizer added that he had some information that there was a
'conservative' meteorologist on another floor, and if he encountered the
performance, there would certainly be 'blowback.' Here, a vague
reference to an unspecified person's conservatism (by which we mean
homophobia) was sufficient to cause us to second-guess what was
appropriate at the conference. Here, it is clear how '\[i\]nnuendo,
gossip, \[and\] hearsay... become indispensable forms of knowledge' in
the act of censorship (Tyburczy 2015, 59).

Ultimately, [the potential 'space invasion' posed by both the drag
performance and 'Redbone' were **managed with spatial
tactics**]{.underline}. For safety as well as political reasons, the
drag performers could not use the elevators. [It was resolved that they
could make use of various spaces on the third floor (one of the floors
belonging to the Dept. of Geography), including meeting rooms and other
miscellaneous spaces. It was also suggested that the time and location
of this performance would be clearly marked on a map of the conference
space, presumably so that one could make an informed choice about
attending it or not]{.underline}. This way, one would not unwillingly
encounter a nonnormatively gendered performance artist when they had not
explicitly 'signed up' to do so by attending a critical geography
conference. In the same discussion, it was suggested that the other
controversial piece, 'Redbone,' be sequestered in the graduate student
lounge, while the rest of the works were displayed prominently in the
hallway and that it also be placed on a map, so that people interested
in viewing it could find it (it was later excluded due to code issues).
Here, the map emerged as a key technology in including some works
differently. [Given that the rest of the artworks were all contained in
one stretch of hallway]{.underline} (making a map unnecessary), [we can
wonder if the map was meant to orient visitors to the works and to
render them more visible, or if it was a strategy proposed to hide works
that made political statements, particularly in light of the fact that
the only two works subjected to this treatment were ones concerned
explicitly with gender, sexuality, and race]{.underline}.

These spatial tactics were deemed necessary to avoid offending people,
be they participants in the conference or people who somehow happened to
be in the conference space. At various points, these concerns were
embodied and conjured up in the figure of 'old-school' department
members, conference-going children, conservative meteorologists, and
members of an unspecified, yet seemingly present reactionary polity. The
audience at issue never included us. In all cases, external threats
loomed over the process of including certain works. In retrospect, these
various substitutions projected the discomfort and concern of those
involved onto vaguely defined others, others we could not control or
communicate with rationally, others that would respond with 'blowback.'
It was these others and their conservative political viewpoints that
drew the boundaries of what we could and could not include. [This
tendency to externalize our own fears, racial privilege, and homophobia
onto imaginary others undercut the potential for collective reflection
on the boundaries of critical geographies. If we are concerned about the
future of critical geographies, it is worth reflecting on how this
silence was guaranteed and indeed, rendered apolitical, by our
self-assured status as 'critical geographers.']{.underline}

**[New methods (of vetting), old forms of exclusion]{.underline}**

What these negotiations demonstrate most forcefully is how social
positionalities, **[relations of authority]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} [**imaginaries of the institution** and its values
**constrain** potential **interventions into disciplinary
space**]{.underline}. Here, [decisions about what]{.underline}
'**[belonged']{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the department's
**[intellectual]{.underline}** and physical **[space]{.underline}**
[were closely sutured to the identities of those with the power to make
such decisions]{.underline}. As Beisel argues, decisions about if art is
appropriate or inappropriate necessarily draw on 'cultural schema that
constitute, and are, in turn, constituted by social structures' (Beisel
1993) including social identities, creating real obstacles for
marginalized subjects to intervene in the dominant -- and
institutionalized -- ways of imagining and practicing space and
knowledge production. [Here, the label 'controversial' functions as 'a
broad category that covers any representation or visitor experience that
upsets the naturalized order of normalcy,]{.underline}' (Tyburczy 2016,
xvi) [serving to police and reproduce what and who counts as legitimate
within the halls of the department]{.underline}. Given these dynamics,
we should not be surprised that, as scholars in creative geographies
have suspected, [new forms of vetting and inclusion indeed function to
reinforce and maintain hegemonic identities and perspectives in the
field under the guise of commonsense decisions about what is or is not
'appropriate']{.underline} (de Leeuw and Hawkins 2017).

As this article has argued, a close attention to the dynamics of staging
creative geographies can illuminate the moments in which decisions are
rendered that allow some works to appear and prevent others from being
recognized. [Mundane institutional processes, like the impromptu
functioning of committees, play a critical role in this
process]{.underline}. For example, [abstracts for the **conference**
**underwent** no form of **vetting for political** or **otherwise
controversial content**]{.underline} (they were merely scanned for
content and topically sorted). However, [as soon as a key organizer
learned about the prospect of the drag performance, a meeting was
specifically convened to examine the content of artworks, specifically
the drag performance.]{.underline}

Nietschmann\'s crack about maps and guns may have captured the sentiment
and ethos of the self-styled \"**[counter-mappers]{.underline}**\" who
emerged in the 1990, but it didn\'t begin to get into the range of
indigenous mapping efforts going on around the world. While the Miskito
[were mapping]{.underline} **[coral reefs]{.underline}** and coastal
lagoons with Nietschmann, forest dwellers in Indonesia were [using maps
to leverage their role in]{.underline} **[managing
resources]{.underline}**. Aboriginal people in
**[Australia]{.underline}**, the Ye\'kuana in
**[Venezuela]{.underline}**, the Embera in **[Panama]{.underline}**, and
the Guarani in **[Bolivia]{.underline}** were all using maps [to
formulate land claims]{.underline} filed with state officials. [Black
communities in **Colombia**]{.underline} were doing the same. In Canada,
the controversial reopening of treaty negotiations with First Nations
kicked off a profusion of mapping projects in **[British
Columbia]{.underline}**. There were mapping projects in **[Papua New
Guinea]{.underline}**, **[Kenya]{.underline}**,
**[Namibia]{.underline}**, **[Nepal]{.underline}**, and the
**[Philippines]{.underline}**, not to mention
**[Bangladesh]{.underline}**, **[Brazil]{.underline}**,
**[Thailand]{.underline}**, and the **[United States]{.underline}**.
Having previously thought of themselves as Siriono and San, as indios,
or even as no more than residents of a particular region or community,
through mapping many of these groups were becoming indigenous in a novel
political sense. **[Mapping]{.underline}** [helped foreground **common
struggles**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** and
resources and cast these [in terms of]{.underline}
\"**[territory]{.underline}**\" [and]{.underline}
\"**[autonomy]{.underline}**\" [recognized as rights]{.underline}
through newly developing legal standards being drafted at the United
Nations and the International Labour Organization (ILO).

The emphasis on legal rights to territory and autonomy echoed calls for
a more sweeping decolonization. In the run-up to the 1992 quin-
centenary of Columbus\'s arrival in the Americas, indigenous organiza-
tions across Latin America made plans for a countercelebration com-
memorating their 500 years of resistance. One of the biggest planning
meetings produced the 1990 Declaration of Quito, which called for the
decolonization of the Americas:

> The existing nation states of the Americas. their constitutions and
> fundamental laws are judicial/political expressions that negate our
> socio-economic, cultural and political rights.
>
> From this point in our general strategy of struggle, we consider it to
> be a priority that we demand complete structural change; change which
> recognizes the inherent right to self-determination throtgh Indians\'
> own governments and through the control of our territories.
>
> Our problems will not be resolved throtgh the self-serving politics of
> governmental entities which seek integration and ethno-development. It
> is necessary to have an integral transformation at the level of the
> state and national society; that is to say, the creation of a new
> nation.\'

The Fourth World envisioned by Nietschmann and George Manuel seemed
close at hand, its contours focused in a profusion of maps depicting
indigenous rights to territory and autonomy.

But the wave of **[indigenous mapping]{.underline}** that began in the
1990s [did not usher in]{.underline} an unprecedented era of
**[decolonization]{.underline}**. Instead [it heralded]{.underline} the
**[mainstreaming]{.underline}** of indigenous mapping [as]{.underline},
above all, a means of **[governing what]{.underline}** might otherwise
have been an [unruly]{.underline} bunch of [claims]{.underline} and
counterclaims [for]{.underline} territory and
**[autonomy]{.underline}**. Instead of being driven by the aims and
goals of Fourth World nations, [these projects were]{.underline}, by and
large, [funded by NGOs]{.underline}. They were joined by an even more
powerful set of players: the **[Ford Foundation]{.underline}**, the U.S.
Agency for International Development (**[USAID]{.underline}**), and the
**[World Bank]{.underline}**.\' In every case, [mapping provided a means
of nominally recognizing indigenous peoples\' rights]{.underline}, while
at the same time assimilating them into a territorial order whose lines
were codified by the law.\'

To understand how this happened, it\'s necessary to see how new mapping
technologies-many of them initially developed for military
applications-facilitated a proliferation of mapping projects. At the
same time its important to see how indigenous mapping fit into the
rather Bowman-esque challenge of fashioning :1 new global political
order fol- lowing the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold
War. But it\'s equally important to see how lines drawn by Cold War
proxy battles in places such as Nicaragua gave shape to the order that
was still to come. This was particularly true for places where
counterinsurgency tactics had broadened beyond armed conflict to engage
peoples\' normative desires for legal protection of their rights, for
development, and peace. All of those desires laid the groundwork for an
order that not only required states to be implemented; they laid the
very basis for the state\'s claims to legitimacy as the guarantor of
stable property rights, of economic growth, and of security.
Counterinsurgency engages these desires, as demonstrated throughout this
book, as a means of imposing a social order that facilitates
distinguishing civilians from combatants and friends from enemies . . .
in the name of more efficiently fighting wars where the perimeters of
the battlefield are socially rather than territorially defined.

As Isaiah Bowman had made clear in his work with The Inquiry during
World War I, organizing space politically according to ethnic identity,
common history, and language provided a means for trans- forming the
boundaries of war into a blueprint for governing. In much the same way,
the World Bank, USAID, and the Ford Foundation, along with countless
other organizations, picked up the techniques of indig- enous mapping by
way of making space gouemable.\' Along the way they transformed the
object of mapping from \"territory\" to \"property,\" replacing the
emphasis on autonomy with the language of markets and the rule of law.5
In short, indigenous mapping was swept into the domi- nant refrain of
capitalism\'s triumph at the end of the Cold War.

Counterrevolution by Other Means

[Central America proved to be pivotal for the mainstreaming of
indigenous mapping]{.underline}. In all accounts, the wars of the 1980s
had left the region in shambles. Their conclusion in the early 1990s did
not bring about peace, but did mark a shift from the violence of
military conflict to that of political and economic restructuring. This
change itself was a legacy of counterinsurgency in the region. Rebranded
by the U.S. military as \"low-intensity warfare,\" counterinsurgency
lowered the emphasis on decisive military victory. Instead, it aimed for
\"a level of internal security that permits economic, political, and
social growth through balanced development programs.\" The doctrine
proved effective at fighting conflicts in which the bat- tlefield
included all of society, weaponizing everything from social divisions to
the procurement of basic needs for food, shelter, and water. Of course,
counterinsurgency did fail to achieve decisive military victories.
Indeed, many of the wars in Central America ended as much because of
cuts in military aid from the United States and the Soviet Union as from
military stalemate and the exhaustion induced by attrition and terror.
The end of armed conflict no more solved the problems than it resulted
in peace. Instead, [it opened the door for ways of fighting war by other
means, by planning for peace through ongoing **efforts to forge an
enduring social order**]{.underline}. From a U.S. policy perspective,
this way of waging war by peaceful means was already at hand in the form
of development. Long used to buffer security during the Cold War,
development\'s goal of economic growth provided a guide for remaking
Central America in line with U.S. economic and security interests.

Nicaragua was the most egregious example of this trend. As a 1991 USAID
report summarizing policy objectives for Nicaragua put it, \"the
strategy presented in this document is an extremely ambitious one. It is
difficult to overemphasize the degree of change in the Nicaraguan
economy and Nicaraguan society which it envisions.\" With former Contra
leaders and their allies in control, this transformation promised a
\"slow-motion counterrevolution\" executed through technocratic reforms
to property rights and the privatization of state assets.\" In
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, USAID officials faced a different
task: one of rehabilitating the legitimacy of states through
development. But in spite of the difference, the goals were similar to
those in Nica- ragua: making use of market-oriented reforms to contain
and neutral- ize political opposition while pursuing regional
unification and inte- gration with U.S. markets. International financial
institutions such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank reinforced the approach, urging states to privatize nationally
owned assets, cut social spending, and stabilize national economies.
Unsurprisingly, none of those efforts guaranteed any semblance of peace.
Instead, they merely forced the region to remake itself in accordance
with U.S. security and economic interests.

This market-oriented vision for rebuilding Central America com- pounded
the threats of dispossession and displacement faced by indig- enous
peoples throughout the region. One of the mandates of structural
adjustment programs directed states to auction off state-owned assets,
including access to natural resources found on so-called national lands.
Historically regarded as national frontiers, states claimed ownership to
these regions due to their lack of identifiable property rights, often
with blatant disregard for indigenous peoples living there. Violence in
these same regions during the 1980s had compounded the displacement of
indigenous peoples, as insurgent groups and proxy forces sought cover in
the dense forests that dominated frontier areas; and the conversion of
these regions to battlefields accelerated the displacement of indigenous
peoples as refugees, emptying them of their occupants and strengthen-
ing perceptions of these areas as \"empty\" national lands.

In addition to the pressure from extractive industries and the strain of
rebuilding lives displaced by war, indigenous peoples throughout the
region faced a third threat from efforts to settle frontier areas
through converting them from forests to farmland. Marching at the head
of this wave were newly demobilized soldiers from insurgent groups and
national armies whose efforts to claim frontier lands brought them into
direct conflict with the indigenous communities living there. As such,
so-called national lands quickly became the focal point for struggles
between competing attempts to bring a sociospatial order to post-war
Central America, pitting newly militant demands for indigenous rights
against state-led development plans. In short, it marked a return to the
standing war that had dominated Central American societies since colo-
nial times. If there was any hope for a peaceful way out of the
predicament, it was going to require an alternative way of valuing
resources and conceiving of social order. And that is precisely \\vhere
Nietschmann\'s call for indigenous maps came in.

conservation through cultural Survival

[In 1992 the National Geographic Society\'s Research and Exploration
journal published a special, bilingual map supplement that proposed just
such an alternative plan for ordering Central America]{.underline}. The
[Coexistence of Indigenous Peoples and Natural Ecosystems in Central
America]{.underline} **[demonstrated]{.underline}** the [coterminous
relationship between]{.underline} **[forests]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the areas in which **[indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** lived, the boundaries of indigenous homelands
coinciding with those of the region\'s remaining forests. In keeping
with National Geographic\'s house style, [the map was a two- sided
affair]{.underline}. [One side]{.underline} (see Figure 6.1)
[presented]{.underline} the **[cartographic \"facts\"]{.underline}** of
the argument, laying natural ecosystems in a range of greens and blues
over a beige-colored \"base\" map with the boundaries of the seven
Central American states: Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. [On top of both were]{.underline} the
**[locations]{.underline}**, in shaded black boundaries, [of what the
map called]{.underline} \"**[indigenous territories]{.underline}**.\" A
trio of inset maps floating over the blue of the Caribbean chronicled
the deforestation of the isthmus, showing forest coverage for the region
in 8000 B.C.l\~2., the 19405, and from 1987 to 1992. [The point of the
map]{.underline}, as its title made clear, [was the relationship
between]{.underline} **[indigenous territories and natural
ecosystems]{.underline}**, especially forests. [The map\'s flipside
**reinforced** the **argument** with National Geographic-quality
**photographs** and brief **overviews** of the indigenous **peoples**
and **environment** of each state.]{.underline}

[The map was produced by Mac Chapin, at the time the Central America
Program Director for Cultural Survival]{.underline}. During the 19805,
Cultural Survival had emerged as the leading outlet for advocacy-
oriented work by academics involved with indigenous rights in the
Americas, including Nietschmann. Through the pages of its journal,
Cultural Survival Quarterly, [scholarly contributors wrote about the
various struggles over territory and autonomy that increasingly defined
\"**indigenous peoples**\" as a **political**, as opposed to an
**anthropological**, **category**]{.underline}. Maps figured in that
conversation, with Cultural Survival directly contributing to Miskito
land tenure efforts in the early 1980s as participants in the Polanco
map effort we described in the last chapter.

Chapin knew this history personally, having visited communities
throughout Central America in his official capacity at Cultural Sur-
vival. Two decades earlier, he\'d also completed a PhD under cultural
anthropologist Keith Basso, whose interest in place had led him to
experiment with mapping methods.\' But the idea of making a map him-
self didn\'t strike Chapin until 1989 while reviewing a submitted manu-
script on \"Mapping the Distribution of Indians in Central America.\" As
Chapin tells it, the article\'s charting of indigenous populations made
an intriguing match with a National Geographic map that hung on his
office wall showing deforestation in Central America. Chapin admits he
knew next to nothing about how to transform his intuition into a map, so
he turned to Nietschmann for help. Nietschmann quickly latched on to the
idea. In his 1989 book on the Miskito struggle, he\'d already pro- duced
a map showing the \"states and nations of Central America\" IFig- ure
6.2).\" Nietschmann gave Chapin a crash course in cartography and helped
to secure funding for the project from the National Ceographic
Society\'s Committee on Research and Fxploration.

With the National Geographic money in hand, Nietschmann helped Chapin
organize the field teams tasked with gathering data for the map in each
of the seven Central American states. In-country experts headed the
field teams in Guatemala. Belize, and El Salvador, and Nietschmann
personally directed the work in Nicaragua. ln Panama and Honduras,
Chapin turned the task of leading the field teams over to a PhD stu-
dent trained by the lead author of the very article on the distribution
of indigenous populations that had sparked his interest. The student was
Peter Herlihy, the very Herlihy we met mapping the Sierra Juarez in
Chapter I.\"

In spite of Chapin\'s role in producing the map, Nietschmann\'s
intellectual influence on the message was unmistakable. In 1987
Nietschmann published an incendiary article in Cultural Survival
Quarterly that kicked off a two-issue series on \"Militarization and
Indigenous Peoples.\" Nietschmann\'s article drew together the worldwide
struggles of indigenous peoples into what he called \"The Third World
War.\"\'3 Fought continuously since the end of World War II on \"every
continent except Antarctica,\" these \"full-sized little wars\" pitted
state armies against the nation peoples who comprised the Fourth World.
These wars were not to be confused with conflicts between states and
insurgents like the Contras, battling over the control of states.
Insofar as the Contras, like the Sandinistas before them, were bent on
state con- trol, from the perspective of the Fourth World their efforts
amounted to \"colonialism by non-Europeans?\" Fourth World struggles
involved, quite literally, remaking the map of the world and challenged
the dominant geopolitical order imposed by states. Since these wars were
not fought between state forces, they were waged \"without rules,\"
outside the limits of the Geneva Conventions regulating state conflict.

Nietschmann\'s arguments captured the imaginations of fellow Fourth
World advocates. It also caught the attention of former Cold War
warriors scrambling to rethink geopolitical security following the
demise of the Soviet Union. Their interest led Nietschmann to reprise
and amend his arguments. In a return to his background on cultural
ecology, Nietschmann added an environmental element to his argument.
With his \"Rule of Indigenous Environments\" Nietschmann asserted that
\"where there are nation peoples with an intact, self-governed home-
land, there are still biologically rich environments.\" In contrast,
\"state environments\" were \"almost always areas of destructive
deforestation, desertification, massive freshwater depletion and
pollution, and large- scale reduction of genetic-biological
diversity.\"\'5 The 1992 [Research and Exploration map helped solidify
Nietschmann\'s argument by highlighting the coterminous relationship
between indigenous peoples\' territories-nations-and natural
ecosystems]{.underline}. Indeed, Nietschmann repeatedly referred to the
map as demonstrating his rule and holding it out as a blueprint for
decolonization.

But no matter how much the map seemed to demonstrate Nietschmann\'s
rule, its text and images equally lent themselves to a far less radical
reading. Over and against historical readings of indig- enous peoples\'
struggles to secure a place for themselves in the world, the [emphasis
on their relationship to the environment presented]{.underline} the
**[territories as essential]{.underline}**, **[ecological
truths]{.underline}**. As much as both Nietschmann and Chapin recognized
this tension, the text that accompanied the map [emphasized]{.underline}
the [relationship]{.underline} [between]{.underline} **[indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the
**[environment]{.underline}** [as an essential one]{.underline}. Instead
of pointing to their rights, Chap- in\'s text portrayed indigenous
peoples as victims of colonial aggression. \"Until recently,\" he wrote,
indigenous peoples in Central America \"had lived in isolation, in
regions of refuge, largely protected from the incur- sion of the outside
world by the thick stands of forest, the heavy rainfall, and generally
inhospitable environment\" that dominates the region\'s Caribbean
lowlands. \"Now all this has changed,\" he continued:

> Since the 1940. exponential population growth throughout Central Amer-
> ica, capitalist schemes utilizing new technologies. and advances in

> minerals. As all of these forces advance. the forests are cut down and

> extinction. 15

Chapin\'s text transformed the map from a blueprint for decolonization
to a proposal for better governing Central America through conservation
and development. It put indigenous peoples at the forefront of this
struggle, but not as nations, as Nietschmann advocated. [Instead it
emphasized their role as conservationists. Chapin underscored this
point, calling for international conservationists \"to form alliances
and to work with local people as a means of solving common problems and
reaching common obiectives\"]{.underline} \'7
