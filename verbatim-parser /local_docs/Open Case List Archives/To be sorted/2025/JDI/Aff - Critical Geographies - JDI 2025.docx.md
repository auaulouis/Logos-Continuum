[[Indigenous homelands]{.underline}]{.mark}, once
[**[refashioned]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}]{.mark} [capitalist
**[extraction points]{.mark}**]{.underline} and tourist destinations of
wild Alaska beauty, [[are now]{.underline} [**reconstituted** and
**remade**]{.underline}]{.mark} once again. [In this
iteration]{.underline}, [they are made [into]{.mark}]{.underline}
landscapes of [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[different]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[kind of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[loss]{.underline}]{.mark}**.4 As portraits of the destruction of
climate change proliferate, glaciers are placed center stage---[glacier
is now an icon made into]{.underline} **[nowhere]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} somehow, now, **[everywhere]{.underline}**. [Glacier's
face is melting]{.underline} in the news; [glacier melt is around us in
the sea and in the rise]{.underline}.
**[[Mainstream]{.underline}]{.mark}** climate change
**[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}** work to [**[universalize
glaciers]{.underline}** [as a kind of **commons**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[a commons [of scenery and of]{.mark} [assured]{.mark} environmental
[apocalypse]{.mark} for all humanity.]{.underline} Glaciers and ice come
to narrate a story about climate change that overlooks and undermines
Indigenous historical and ongoing social relationships to their
homelands.5

In many dominant narrations, the disappearance of glaciers and other
forms of ice are linked to the narration of the declension of Native
peoples. [[Native homelands become **rhetorically
de-peopled**]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus [reenacting actual attempts to
de-people the landscape]{.underline}. Not only are glaciers transformed
into the commons of scenery, of aesthetic value, but they are also
understood as dangerous in that their synchronized melting has the
potential to unsettle a temperate world that relies on sea level
stability, among other forms of stasis.

Ice and glaciers as part of the cryosphere have always been central to
the globe's stable functioning. This is particularly true for Indigenous
peoples who have already known such facts about glaciers and ice---that
home and homeland is of utmost importance. [[Ice has always been
consequential]{.mark}, understood [through]{.mark} generations of
**[Indigenous]{.mark} knowledge production and
[practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and not only through a contemporary
melting. Yet, now, in a moment of a quickly changing global climate
there is a new danger of ice in potentia. In its melting, the
catastrophic potentiality of glacier, of Indigenous ice, is marked as a
looming specter. In this framing, glacier ice is more than a landmark
that should be preserved because "there will come a time when your
grandkids . . . they'll want to see this."6 [If glacier ice in Alaska
rings out in the contemporary moment as abundantly consequential, ice in
a larger scope is also being studied, imagined, and thought of more
intensely in new, but also not so new, realms.]{.underline}

In my own lifetime, I've seen new shapes of ice and land. I also see
what surges and remains. te'ya'lee (king salmon), from aanguu'nuw, swim
fat in silty glacier water as baby fish and return to the same waters at
the end of their lives to spawn. When I make my way home in summer to
visit with people, fish, plants, and glaciers, I notice how these
relations, too, have changed. te'ya'lee are fewer and smaller, as are
the glaciers. Glacier's face retreats from mine each year that I visit,
and the cold lake between us grows with melt.

When I attempt to recount my concerns---emplaced, affective, and
embodied---of seeing glaciers of home change their shapes, before I have
formed the words into expression, the reflection feels overdetermined
and compromised. [[Is there a story]{.mark} I can tell [that isn't
inevitably circumscribed]{.mark} and interpreted [as
destruction]{.mark}, demise, disruption, and
declension[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [A recounting from home that can do
something other than **deliver** a **narrative of decline**]{.underline}
[not just of the **planet**]{.underline} [but also and always the
**devastation of Native peoples?**]{.underline} [Some [stories of ice
melt are **easy to tell** and]{.mark} **to
[consume]{.mark}**]{.underline}: one can witness representations and
mediations of ice melt, everywhere but also from nowhere in particular.7
This narrative of melt is so ubiquitous that it is nearly passé. Such
stories are also urgent and necessary.

Stories of decline did not emerge with glacier melt. [[Trauma and pain
have always]{.mark} served and **[satiated]{.mark} the [desires of
some]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at the expense of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang argue that the
overrepresentation of **[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**- and
pain-centered narratives [[animates]{.underline} **[academic
research]{.underline}**]{.mark}, particularly research completed on (not
for or with) communities that are "not White, not wealthy, and not
straight." 8 [The pair offer]{.underline} [[instead]{.underline}]{.mark}
what they call **[[desire-based research]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Desire
is time-warping]{.underline}. [It [troubles]{.mark} the work that
[damage]{.mark}-centered [research]{.mark} tries to accomplish in
reifying a settler temporality]{.underline} and suppresses other
experiences of time.9 [**[Desire is an antidote]{.underline}**; [it
centers]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [concerns]{.mark} and research
[desired by Native communities]{.mark} and communities in
solidarity]{.underline}, [[which may not always look like **offering our
specific orientations**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the world **[for eager
eyes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Desire can also be a]{.mark} studying-up,
a [studying-around to contextualize how]{.mark} the [politics]{.mark} of
the present [came into being]{.mark} historically]{.underline}. [It can
be a takedown that then serves to make space for and uplift Indigenous
knowledge production and co-theorizing]{.underline}.
**[Desire]{.underline}**-[based]{.underline} **[research]{.underline}**
[might also ask what the **land desires**]{.underline}, [as desire is
not only **unidirectional**]{.underline}.

[Desire-based research shapes]{.underline} my [concerns
about]{.underline} ice in part to disrupt the twinned narratives that
**[entangle apocalyptic]{.underline}** environmental
**[decline]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the **[disappearance of
Native peoples]{.underline}**. [[The language of
**crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} and disruption **[[is]{.mark} an
[enticing]{.mark} one]{.underline}**. [[It calls for action]{.mark}, it
[stirs rage and uproar]{.mark}, it is affective and therefore potently
effective]{.underline}. [[It calls for]{.mark} an **[uncritical
return]{.mark}**]{.underline} to sometime preindustrial and precontact,
to nowhere in particular. [Crisis is a road to nowhere.]{.underline}

In that nowhere, [[Native peoples will always be in
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}---[we will [always]{.mark} be
[declining]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[always
[diluted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[altered]{.underline}**, **[[verging
on extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.10 **[Extinction]{.underline}**
[was the narrative I grew up enmeshed and embroiled within]{.underline}.
[[The **damage-centered narrative of extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and decline [[is]{.mark} "enamored with [knowing]{.mark} through
[pain]{.mark}" [and makes unthinkable]{.mark} forms of [living
**outside**]{.mark} **of ideals** of **[progress or
beautification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.11 [We are]{.underline}
**[[extinct]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} we are
**[[revitalized]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [we are disappeared
or]{.underline} we are **[intensely studied]{.underline}** [before our
inevitable disappearance]{.underline}.

Having my experience as dAXunh narrated through the lens of loss--- of
language, of homelands, of salmon, of glaciers---is something that
informs the way I teach, research, and write. When I study ice, my own
concerns as a nonconsensual subject of crisis, of extinction, inform
that inquiry and method as one who has been unwillingly forced to
represent decline and mediate it back to an audience that is challenged
by other forms of story and storytelling.

**[Glaciers are contested terrain]{.underline}**, a material landscape
of memory and narrative, and are an agential force capable of enactments
not always legible to human faculties. Those dimensions of glaciers
knowable by human tools have been and continue to be dominated by polar
sciences: glaciology, paleoecology, geomorphology, and geophysics.
Science is often considered in this view as the default, proper form of
evidence, a reliance that has been crafted and maintained over time. In
that maintenance [other forms of **knowing** and
**recording**]{.underline} outside of the written word and of
collectable, legible, storable data **[have been intentionally
maligned]{.underline}**. [Many of those knowledges are not only
overlooked but actively erased and disparaged in the upholding of
colonial and dominant forms of comprehension. As a changing climate
transforms glaciers into nonfrozen states, scientific knowledge
production of ice and glacial activity as threat increases.]{.underline}

Glaciers loom and figure large in the dominant cultural imaginary, often
unmoored from the additional extinction narratives in which they are
entwined and co-constitute. If such knowledge production should grow, so
too should creative formations of knowledge about glaciers and ice as
active entities. Poetry and prose provide invitations, offerings, and
feeling-places, full with multiply sited and multitemporal relations and
experiences with glaciers and ice geographies.12 Literary contributions
add to scholarship that rethinks the glacier as a site of liveliness, as
opposed to an inanimate or dead metaphor.13 [[Rewriting and
thinking]{.mark} again [with glaciers]{.mark} and ice [attends to
Indigenous articulations and **ongoing historical
relationships**]{.mark} in ways [that **overturn**]{.mark} the
**colonial [fascination]{.mark}** []{.mark}and masculinist desire
**[for]{.mark} control over [glacial bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14
This conversation also critiques the violence inherent in flattening the
dense sociality of glaciers into a dataset. In this moment of climate
change, ice geographies are intensely monitored and measured by
scientific tools that collect data, which is often used to create future
climate models. These models take somewhere data and extrapolate it into
a story for everywhere and nowhere specific. A glacier melts in
dAXunhyuu territory, Łingít territories, et cetera, and the model tells
us by what year Lenapehoking (New York City) will be under water.

In my experiences with glaciers many things happen at once. [To be in
the presence of a glacier is singular and disruptive to space and time.
I also aim to offer glacial spaces as at once a pedestrian site of
mundane Indigenous activity as a co-relation and co-creator of humble
intimacies. Glacier is not simply a material manifestation of the
sublime, aesthetic value, or rugged individualism---or, in its newest
form, a locale for mourning the destruction of a modern warming
world.]{.underline}

Melting glaciers are used as evidence of a changing climate that
endangers a "human species," but glaciers are not and have not been
experienced by humans equally across time.15 [Native peoples at once
experience a rapidly changing climate, and before we can name that
change in our own words, **[the narrative of crisis and apocalypse has
monopolized the discourse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further, the global
climate and the narration of its transformation casts the idea of change
into the politics of liberalism of "good, social change" or "bad,
climate change." [This **complicates** how **Native peoples change**,
whether we can juridically change, and disrupts our ability to **narrate
our change** for **ourselves** on **our own terms**.]{.underline}

[While glacial movement is **currently** **narrated** through melt and
**transformation to water**, **glaciers** are always **moving**, even in
their solid **form**]{.underline}. [Pulled by gravity and transforming
the physical and social geographies around and beneath them, glaciers
are carving their own ideas onto this world.]{.underline} Glaciers are
not an easy modern object/subject of spectacularism to be chased and
surveilled. Glaciers watch, listen, make judgments, desire, and glaciers
respond. Glaciers move on their own accord, based on their own will and
sometimes at the request of human need.16 Glaciers exceed the confining
roles of scientific knowledge production that translate ice into data.17
[[Icy bodies]{.mark} are named and claimed, but they also usurp and
[override]{.mark} the [colonial bindings]{.mark} that distinct human
groups wish to make on and of them. Glacier is not mine, and glacier is
not yours]{.underline}. **[[Glacier is here and here and here and
here.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Debates centered on state development and exploration carry an epistemic baggage of conquest that overdetermine research and silence alternative modes of knowing.

When **[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}** about glacier motion emerged in
the second half of the 19th century, two central protagonists -- the
early leading glaciologists James Forbes and John Tyndall -- [[competed
for credibility]{.underline}]{.mark} by pinning their scientific
contributions to their abilities [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} 'manly'
mountaineers and **[[heroic conquerors]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
European Alps. Forbes theorized that glaciers behaved more like a
semi-fluid body, flowing downhill as a viscous fluid rather than as a
solid object. He highlighted his fieldwork in the mountains and among
the glaciers to legitimate his theory. Tyndall, on the other hand,
argued that glaciers moved more like a solid substance flowing over
bedrock. He eventually triumphed in this debate, contends Hevly (1996),
because Tyndall mobilized his greater fame as a mountaineer -- having
achieved many pioneering first ascents -- and deployed a rhetoric of
manly risk and exertion. There was what Hevly calls a 'culture of field
science' in the 19th century that favored 'authentic, rigorous, manly
experience', and scientists -- let alone women -- who did not explicitly
demonstrate that their glaciological conclusions stemmed from heroic,
manly adventures struggled to make their scientific claims credible.
[[Glaciology was for]{.mark} muscular [gentlemen scientists]{.mark}.
Women could read about glaciers in the Alps, but they were not fit for
glaciological research, field science, or even alpine tourism. And men
like Forbes who lacked the manly heroism of risk-taking mountaineers
lost scientific credibility that hinged on masculinism.]{.underline}

[[Heroic conquests were]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[central to
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic exploration from the 19th
century. [[The Arctic was]{.underline}]{.mark} an important [[site
of]{.underline}]{.mark} American **[[exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the 19th century [[because it was a space where]{.underline}]{.mark}
the nation's [[anxieties]{.mark} [about]{.mark}]{.underline} the perils
of **[[over-civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 'manly character and
racial purity' [[could be tested]{.underline}]{.mark} (Robinson, 2006).
Ice had a great hold on the British imagination at the same time, as
[[the Arctic was a space in which]{.underline}]{.mark} British
**[[explorers]{.underline}]{.mark}** could
[[manifest]{.underline}]{.mark} their evangelical Christianity while
simultaneously affirming the place of women in [**[the domestic
sphere]{.underline}** [through passive consumption
of]{.underline}]{.mark} heroic and manly
**[[stories]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Spufford, 1999). Antarctic
exploration in the first half of the 20th century continued this
emphasis on manly endeavor, especially through military structures, such
as through the centrality of the Royal Navy to British expeditions at
both poles, or the mid-20th-century American projections into Antarctica
(Belanger, 2006; Rose, 1980) and the Arctic (Farish, 2013;
Martin-Nielsen, 2012, 2013). [These same masculinist tendencies were
also reinforced through the scientific and geographical institutions
that sponsored research and exploration, such as the Royal Geographical
Society in London -- which did not admit women fellows until 1913
(Jones, 2003) -- or the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University
of Cambridge, where work, despite discourses of masculine adventure and
field research, relied on the (barely recognized) library and
administrative labor of women]{.underline} (Roberts, 2011).

Masculine and heroic rhetoric was so dominant that **[[attempts to
reframe discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Arctic work in the 1950s
and 1960s -- as part of broader attempts by environmental scientists to
make their science more 'scientific' through experimentation rather than
observation -- [[had limited success]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[scientific [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Canadian Polar
Continental Shelf Project (1958--70), for example, [[attempted to frame
the Arctic as]{.underline}]{.mark} an '**[[experimental]{.mark}
space']{.underline}** [[rather than]{.mark} an]{.underline}
'**[[expeditionary]{.mark} space']{.underline}**, as the basis of the
credibility of both their scientific work and Canada's territorial
aspirations. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, their
[[deployment]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'a precarious authority of
experiment' **[[fared poorly]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the course of
difficult Arctic field work; [[they could not
escape]{.underline}]{.mark} the '**[Boy Scout attitude]{.underline}** to
Arctic fieldwork' [and]{.underline} the '**[[epistemic baggage]{.mark}
of the exploratory tradition]{.underline}** and adventurous
observation'. Though these attempted reframings of Arctic work did not
preclude latent masculinities, they did suggest tensions with more
explicit masculinities (Powell, 2007).

**[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** masculinist and heroic **[[narratives
persist]{.underline}]{.mark}** today. [The Ohio State University
glaciologist]{.underline} Lonnie Thompson, who extracts and studies
high-mountain ice cores, for example, [has been described as today's
'Indiana Jones' and 'one of the true scientific heroes of our
age']{.underline} (Struck, 2006; Krajick, 2002). While Thompson
conscientiously studies ice and works with local communities (Bowen,
2005), media and popular accounts cast him, regardless of his actual
intentions, as a pioneer explorer, overcoming hardships and conquering
supposedly unknown mountains in distant places. Most popular accounts of
Thompson -- which often overlook the presence of his wife, Ellen
MosleyThompson, a world-renowned ice researcher -- focus explicitly on
his overcoming asthma and a host of other obstacles while conducting
fieldwork. [Overcoming personal hardship is also at the center of the
documentary film Chasing Ice]{.underline} (Exposure, 2012), and its
protagonist, [the filmmaker photographer James Balog. Instead of
focusing on the glaciers that Balog photographs, the film follows him
and his Extreme Ice Survey into 'treacherous terrain' where Balog
struggles with failing knees, strenuous conditions, falling rocks and
ice, and existential risk to tell the tale of vanishing
glaciers]{.underline}. Balog's assistants even wonder in one scene if
they should have stuck to their office job given the risks they face in
the field. Balog may not have chosen this approach, but [the filmmakers
and media adhere to tropes of masculine vigor, risk, adventurous
exploration, and heroic science to attract audiences and validate
research, thereby sustaining these masculinist glacier narratives into
the 21st century]{.underline}.

Thompson and Balog's work is impressive to be sure because collecting
the data they gathered was no easy feat and they are yielding insights
for science and climate change impacts. But read alongside older heroic
scientific narratives, the masculinist attributions ascribed to this
type of field science remain prevalent over three centuries. To be
credible, glaciologists, according to most commentators, still need to
be experienced mountain climbers to overcome high altitude, limited
oxygen, cold temperatures, circumscribed logistical support, and overall
rugged working conditions. As Savage (2015: 396) reports in the journal
Nature, 'Young scientists who are considering a career in ice-core
palaeoclimatology ought to have some experience with climbing, says Doug
Hardy of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, if only to know
whether or not they can handle it.' While Savage recognizes that those
without 'the inclination or the ability to climb glaciers' can find
other positions in glaciology, such as computer modeling, the article's
sub-headline ('Climb any mountain: Glaciology is an outdoors game')
certainly does not celebrate these indoor desk jobs. Nor does such a
depiction consider class barriers for entry into the field, such as the
high costs of acquiring and maintaining necessary alpine skills.
[[Alternative knowledges and practices are marginalized]{.mark} in this
sustained masculinist atmosphere, [restricting]{.mark} scientific
[questions asked,]{.mark} practitioners involved, [methods
employed]{.mark}, sites studied, [and results
achieved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Manliness in the field thus makes the science (and scientist) more
credible. A recent feature in the New York Times follows researchers
onto the Greenland ice sheet, for example, where they race against time
and a precarious helicopter, survive the 'frozen landscape' of this
hostile environment, and altruistically overcome death to get glacier
runoff data. As Lincoln Pitcher was quoted as saying, if his fellow
researcher fell into the river atop the ice sheet, 'the death rate is
100 percent' (Davenport et al., 2015). The article focuses very little
on the scientific questions asked, or even the scientific implications
of the study beyond broad claims about glacier shrinkage and sea level
rise. It focuses instead on the processes of doing glaciological
science, not the science itself. Yet New York Times coverage for these
researchers -- especially the graduate student at the center of it --
can significantly enhance a career. In this way, the portrayal of
masculinist researchers in the media (because that is what sells,
presumably) can shape scientific credibility in the academy, such as
with hiring and possibly even with peer reviewing. Being a pioneer,
being first, enduring physical hardship, risking death, overcoming wild
nature -- in short, being as manly as the Victorian
mountaineer-glaciologists were more than a century ago -- continues to
influence scientists' credibility, or on the other side, their lack of
credibility for those who cannot pitch their research through such
masculinist frameworks.

V Systems of scientific domination

[Feminist glaciology builds on feminist postcolonial science studies and
feminist political ecology to understand how gender, power, and
inequality are embedded in systems of scientific domination]{.underline}
(Schiebinger, 2014). Such **[power structures maintain
glaciology]{.underline}** [as a **discipline concentrated**]{.underline}
[in the wealthy developed world, often termed the Global North, with
generally weak institutional representation from the developing world or
indigenous communities]{.underline}. This pattern exists for global
climate simulations in general, which are conducted by European and
North American scientists with little to no representation from Central
and South America, Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia (Edwards,
2011). The feminist lens is crucial for effective analysis of what might
look on the surface like postcolonial or hegemonic structures of
development. [But **global power imbalances** and **gender inequality
co-constitute each other** -- and the natural sciences and **glaciology
in particular**]{.underline}. Current climate change
**[[discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example,
[[perpetuate]{.underline} **[power discrepancies]{.underline}**
[through]{.underline}]{.mark} what Israel and Sachs (2013: 34--5) refer
to as 'the centrality of mathematical and technological science
\...structured by masculinist ideologies of domination and mastery',
thus [[determining who can or cannot participate in]{.underline}]{.mark}
climate science and **[[policy-making]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Such
institutional, cultural, and scientific practices also affect
glaciological knowledge. While there are, on paper, few recognized
glaciologists from the Global South (for exceptions see Carey, 2010),
[[such **recognition**]{.underline} [is predicated
upon]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [specific type of **knowledge
production**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that is restricted to]{.mark} a
group of [scientists who often cannot be divorced from]{.mark} larger
[processes of]{.mark} **colonialism**]{.underline},
**[imperialism]{.underline}**, **[patriarchy]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[[capitalist resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Questions of who produces glaciological knowledge, and how such
knowledge is used or shared, take on real implications when considered
through feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political
ecology lenses. [Specifically, the feminist approach opens up
marginalized knowledge and exposes how larger [structures of
domination]{.mark} have worked historically to [suppress]{.mark} certain
[voices]{.mark}]{.underline}. It reveals how
**[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}** across the planet [have been [living
with **glaciers for centuries**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
have [[produced wide ranges of **glaciological
knowledge**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- folk glaciology -- [[that is
rarely]{.mark} [recognized]{.mark} within the scientific discipline of
modern glaciology]{.underline}. We use the term 'folk glaciology' to
refer to significant glacier-oriented knowledges [produced at different
times and places by diverse peoples, cultures, and social
groups.]{.underline}

#### The push to [Arctic]{.underline} research parallels [explorer epistemologies]{.underline} that tie [polar knowledge production]{.underline} to [colonial domination]{.underline} and [civilization]{.underline} of indigenous peoples.

**Stuhl 16**, Associate professor of environmental studies and sciences
at Bucknell University. (Andrew, *Unfreezing the Arctic: Science,
Colonialism, and the Transformation of Inuit Lands*, Introduction: "Is
the Arctic Out of Time, pg. 2-3, published 2016, RC)

We start with [scientists]{.underline}. Their [concepts and [research
practices]{.mark} have [accompanied efforts to conquer]{.mark}, cajole,
[civilize]{.mark}, capitalize, [consume]{.mark}, [and conserve the far
north since the late 1800s]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may feel odd for
some readers to link the pursuit of truths about the natural world with
colonialism, especially in such a sparsely populated zone. But [reflect
for a moment on the most popular chapter of Arctic history: the search
for the North Pole. As historians have deftly shown, American, Danish,
and Norwegian explorers scoured the Arctic Ocean at the turn of the
twentieth century not simply to seek out adventure but to find the
world's remaining unclaimed lands]{.underline}. [They returned south as
national heroes because they expanded their home country's territorial
possessions]{.underline}. [**[Redrawing maps to display]{.mark} their
[discoveries]{.mark}**, [they sprinkled]{.mark} the [names]{.mark} of
sponsors [on bays, islands, straits, and narrows]{.mark}. In these
material ways, **[explorers extended Euro-American authority over the
Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline}3 [Like their maps, **[explorers' tales
about]{.mark} an Arctic [terra incognita]{.mark} and savage Inuit
[helped southerners claim the north]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [With their
words, they painted the Arctic as isolated and
inhospitable]{.underline}. At times, [they portrayed Inuit communities
as backward for relying on Stone Age technologies for survival and
primitive because they appeared to know neither religion nor
law]{.underline}. [In other instances, Inuit were strong---superhuman,
even---for subsisting in an environment without trees, warmth, or
readily accessible game]{.underline}. Historians analyze these
depictions of the Arctic in relation to when they were produced and the
dramas playing out at that time. [**Explorers' narratives were products
of metropolitan societies concerned with the effects of
overcivilization**, a softness emerging from the urban existence that
replaced life on the farm over the end of the nineteenth
century]{.underline}. [Those who consumed scientific ideas measured the
Arctic against the norms of the Euro-American experience, reifying that
experience as superior.]{.underline} [An exotic place, one uninfluenced
by machines and morality, then, was not an objective observation, but a
view through imperial eyes]{.underline}.4 The ways historians have
unpacked polar exploration illustrates the conceptual framework of this
book. That is, [**[scientific representations]{.mark} of Arctic nature
[are entangled with human interventions]{.mark} in the region**. A map
of the North Pole in 1909 was not an exact reproduction of the physical
environment of coastlines and ocean currents. Instead, it was a document
born from particular field experiences in particular places and widely
held desires for global dominance.]{.underline} Philosopher Ian Hacking
puts it this way: "Science is said to have two aims: theory and
experiment. Theories try to say how the world is. Experiment and
subsequent technology change the world. We represent and we intervene.
We represent in order to intervene, and we intervene in light of our
representations." Perhaps readers already understand this relationship
intuitively, given the adage "knowledge is power."[**5 [Polar
exploration is]{.mark} just [one example of the pursuit of knowledge
converging with colonial ambition in the Arctic]{.mark}.** Ideas of
nature changed over time. [New paradigms pushed researchers to ask
different questions]{.mark} about the north [just as human activity
there altered the environment]{.mark}, requiring continued
analysis]{.underline}. I use the term scientist to refer to an unwieldy
group of people, from museum-based naturalists in the late 1800s to
geophysicists working for military agencies during World War II to
ecologists translating research into political activism in the 1960s.
The differences among them are many, but what they share is this: at the
moment they appear in this book, they compete for the mantle on
definitive questions of scientific understanding, natural resource
management, and national development. In these ways, [the
nineteenth-century specimen collector inhabits a social and intellectual
space similar to the climate scientist today. By bringing these
practitioners together in this way, [we thread diverse representations
and interventions]{.mark} in different historical periods in a
line---[thus reconnecting the Arctic's colonial past with its

I use the term **[[ice geographies]{.underline}]{.mark}** to conduct the
analyses in this book to [**[foreground]{.underline}** [how ice has been
marshalled to do certain]{.underline} ]{.mark}[kinds of [work in]{.mark}
various related and overlapping **[political
contexts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Ice geographies are constituted by the
large-scale categories of **polar**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other
ice-covered and **[high-altitude places]{.underline}**. [Ice geographies
are large in material form such as ice sheets and glaciers, as well as
small geographies of ice constituted by individual snowflakes and snow
crystals]{.underline}. [[Ice geographies]{.underline}]{.mark} are places
where there is proximity to ice in its many forms, in many scales, and
**[[is a constitutive element of Indigenous experience and
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, then,
**[[encompasses]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[sub-Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Antarctica]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [I offer characterizations of ice
that are uneasily categorized by perceptions of the colonial or
continental-theoretical]{.underline}. **[[Ice does not produce
agriculture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it does not give root, [[it does
**not generate arborescence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it is **not
rhizomatic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It has been written as]{.mark} a
[geopolitical zone that]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[defies bureaucratic
clarity]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as neither land nor water]{.underline}.2
**[[Ice is a conundrum]{.underline}]{.mark}** across academic
disciplines; it confounds an aesthetic determinacy through lens or by
brush. Immensity of glacier and icefield remains an artistic puzzle and
representational bane.3 Ice is slow and plodding as it shifts, breaks,
and hardens; [[it can be dangerously rapid when reconstituted]{.mark} as
meltwater]{.underline}. [[It is rendered
precarious]{.underline}]{.mark}, a disappearing artifact and
[[simultaneously]{.mark} a [deadly]{.mark} force]{.underline}
substantively [[equipped to annihilate]{.mark} a [temperate world
**outside**]{.mark} of the [**ice geographies** it is meant to]{.mark}
"**naturally**" or **[correctly constitute]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
materialities, spatialities, and imaginaries of ice are simultaneously
and equally consequential]{.underline}.4 [I analyze race and indigeneity
and matter together, as placing matter as a primary mode of study
assists in critically understanding the enactments of racialization and
dispossession.]{.underline}

[**[Ice geographies]{.mark}** in a contemporary, normative sense are
dominantly imagined and **[circulate as landscapes of
consequence]{.mark}** only in their **declining transitory states** [as
they pose]{.mark} **potential [problems to geographies imagined as more
meaningful]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5 In its most present form, ice
animates the look and feel of rapid, urgent climate change. Across all
versions of mainstream media, on tv screens, news headlines, and
internet memes, glaciers and ice sheets collapse. [Ice melt is
**mediated out to a mass audience**]{.underline}. However, [viewers
aren't always seeing the infrastructures of colonial-capitalism from
which that ice melt is a consequence]{.underline}. It is true that
today, ice is melting faster than ever before. Melt causes social
upheaval among northern coastal communities, as well as those lives
shaped by sea level rise. Alaska's western coast was pummeled by Typhoon
Merbok in 2022, a storm bigger than has been seen in decades and made
worse by an unusually warm Pacific Ocean, for instance.

Ice melt disrupts long-standing practices of mobility by Indigenous
peoples across all ice geographies. [Communities are meant to relocate
due to rising seas without aid from governments invested in **capitalist
extraction**]{.underline} [directly implicated in sea level
rise]{.underline}. [Relations with ice shift more quickly than ever
remembered, which challenge Indigenous fishing, harvesting, and hunting
practices]{.underline}. As of 2021, **[the Arctic is warming at a pace
four times faster than the rest of the planet]{.underline}**.6 [Sea ice
volume in the Arctic has reduced by two-thirds]{.underline} since it was
first measured in 1958.7 One of Antarctica's ice shelves named "Doomsday
Glacier" parts away from itself and into the ocean. Simultaneously, an
inundation of climate models anticipates a sea level rise over the next
decade, half century, and century that will reshape the sociality of the
globe. Readers, viewers, and listeners are told that melting ice will
continue to disrupt a more temperate world as sea levels rise in every
imaginable future because of and despite change in human behavior.
[Simultaneously, activism and pro-active initiatives by Arctic
Indigenous people(s) abound and multiply for climate
justice.]{.underline}

[Ice melt also creates and collides with other natural disasters
heightened under the conditions of capitalist resource extraction and
accumulation, like floods, fires, and freeze]{.underline}. That same
[[ice melt]{.underline}]{.mark} in the far North [[creates new
opportunities for]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[expansion of
profit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of [**[shipping lanes]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[mobility of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seemingly ever-**[[expanding resource extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Melting icebergs are transported by artists to well-trafficked city
squares and conferences that bring melt to a more temperate experience
of everyday life. Ice has become an unprecedented daily mediated
experience of modernity across the globe. As a result, [conditions of
ice are now a key interest for political, economic, academic, and
activist stakeholders]{.underline}. This unsettling potential of ice
thus spatially and temporally shapes the ways that contemporary humans
understand the past, respond to the present, and plan for the future.

Yet, ice has always been at the center of making sense of the world.
[**Ice as a de-peopled melting catastrophe**, as a threat that will
unsettle the settled and the settlers, is a modern iteration of
**long-standing ice anxieties**, **obsessions**, and normative
**orderings**]{.underline}. [[It has taken]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[considerable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [number of]{.underline}
[**[colonial enactments]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} certain
sets of [**[humans]{.underline}** [to imagine the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, and other ice geographies, [[as
empty]{.mark} and de-peopled.]{.underline} [Especially as ontologically,
cosmologically, and juridically, ice in part shapes and figures the
world for many Indigenous peoples who call the Arctic home and
homeland]{.underline}, and have for thousands of years.8 Reflections on
ice have also long been a constitutive element of Western political
thought and cultural imagination for hundreds of years.9 [The way that
ice geographies are figured in contemporary discourse are just one piece
of a longer story of ice relations and imaginings.]{.underline}

Ice is anything but an innocent, pristine entity or apolitical,
geographical soothsayer. Historically, ice has been cast as blank,
barren, empty and/or ahistorical and disconnected from ongoing
socialities, human or otherwise.10 [Often a description of emptiness
attends the desires of extraction in some form such as resource
extraction of crude oil or natural gas]{.underline}. In many colonial
cases, **[landscapes]{.underline}** [must be made empty for **white
masculinity** to be **tested against it** or **technological invention**
to be tested **within it**.]{.underline} [Across landscapes that are not
immediately identifiable as easily workable for capitalist enterprise
such as those of ice, desert, or swamp, [the **articulated**
"**emptiness**"]{.mark} of a landscape [**opens** it for **capitalist
improvement**]{.mark}, development, [or other]{.mark} forms of
**[extractive property relation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In the Arctic,
emptiness is articulated to identify it as
exploitable]{.underline}]{.mark}.11 [[The practical response has been to
evidence]{.underline} **[nonemptiness]{.underline}**]{.mark} through a
demonstration of liveliness and fullness, as clear evidence of why not
to harm and exploit what was previously interpreted as empty---**[[to
fill the empty Arctic with life]{.underline}]{.mark}**.12 It is not
empty; it is vibrant, it is full of history, stories, relations, and
peoples. [[These claims are correct]{.mark}, [and I pause at the impulse
to fill]{.mark} some [manufactured void]{.mark} with
information]{.underline}. **[[Who am I trying to
persuade]{.underline}]{.mark}**, exactly, with whose relations, and
[[with what tools]{.mark} and methods of proof[?]{.mark}]{.underline}

I'd like to push a bit on the strategic necessity to argue for the
legible fullness of ice geographies, both ecologically and socially.
[[The response to imbue **ice geographies**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} **[vibrancy]{.underline}** [is also to try to imbue
ice with]{.underline}]{.mark} [more **[acceptable
qualities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for those unfamiliar]{.underline} with
those spaces. [[The urge is to fill ice geographies
with]{.underline}]{.mark} notions of **[[normative
life]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[to unmake]{.mark} or improve its
"**[wasteland]{.mark}**" nature]{.underline} [into
something]{.underline} more recognizably [[aligned
with]{.underline}]{.mark} normative or **[[capitalist
value]{.underline}]{.mark}**, something vibrant or even pure. [[I'd like
to offer]{.mark} a way to relate to ice]{.underline} and ice melt
[in]{.underline} a similar way to what M. Murphy calls "**[chemical
alterlife]{.underline}**." 13 **[[Alterlife]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[questions]{.underline}]{.mark} the normative senses of [[what life is
and]{.mark} "[asks for an unflinchingly pessimistic
acknowledgment]{.mark} that [these chemical relations are
racist,]{.mark} harmful, even deadly, [and]{.mark} that [it is up to you
to take on **the ways that you are caught up in the killing**]{.mark}
([even if they are killing you too]{.mark}, just more
softly)."]{.underline} 14 Each of us is implicated with ice melt.
Though, like the metabolization of chemicals, there is an unequal felt
experience15 of that melt and, of course, the unequal contribution of a
capitalist-carbon "footprint" that makes melt in the first place.16

[[In this alterlife]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which we are all caught up
in the differently experienced melt, [[the **generative capacity of
emptiness**]{.underline} [can act as a reframing]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[I will not rush to **narratively fill
emptiness**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to beautify it toward
progress]{.underline}. Erica Violet Lee writes, "A wasteland is a place
where, we are taught, there is nothing and no one is salvageable. . . .
[Wastelands are spaces deemed unworthy of healing because of the scale
and amount of devastation that has occurred there]{.underline}.
[Wastelands are named wastelands by the ones responsible for their
devastation]{.underline}." 17 I add that [wastelands are named
wastelands by the ones who have no relation]{.underline}, no history [to
lands deemed]{.underline} empty, **[wasted]{.underline}**, and/or
destroyed. **[[I'm unconvinced by the need to]{.mark} prove otherwise,
to [fill emptiness]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In looking closely at a snowflake, the building material of ice, each
snow crystal is shaped by its corners, openings, bubbles, and empty
spaces. These characteristics are what fundamentally constitute the
productive and capacious nature of ice, both scientifically and
aesthetically. [Empty spaces allow for matter to temporarily
cohere]{.underline}. [[Empty spaces allow]{.mark} for the [unknotting of
the bind that yokes us]{.mark} as researchers [to]{.mark} believe that
we must know and **report on every knowable thing** in every **knowable
aspect** about our **research subject**, object, place, and
interlocutors, to [**name** and **intellectualize**]{.mark} a
**feeling** into **data** before we've let it **wash over** and
**saturate us**]{.underline}. [[In emptiness there is]{.mark}
pause]{.underline}. There is no requirement for full, complete
interpretation or translation. [In emptiness, **[critical
co-theorizing]{.mark}**, productive touching, [and contamination]{.mark}
among us [can occur **without** a final answer]{.mark}, magnifying
glass, dictation, a recording device, a funded grant, [a **performance
of complete mastery**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### You should be interested in [taking sides]{.underline}\-\--the [depoliticization]{.underline} of the Arctic designs research for the purpose of answering [racist questions]{.underline}. The grounds on which [think about emptiness]{.underline} and [encounter alterlife research]{.underline} is necessary in [un-asking]{.underline} the questions of colonialism.

[Arctic Indigenous peoples have long-standing relationships with
ice]{.underline}. [These ice relationships have been formulated
through]{.underline} a [millennium]{.underline} of lived experience;
[accumulation of expertise and science]{.underline};
[aesthetic]{.underline} and artistic [interpretations]{.underline};
[cosmological]{.underline}, philosophical, [and theoretical
rubrics]{.underline}; and [juridical structures of
accountability]{.underline}, [among other forms of
relating]{.underline}. In this book, I center literary and theoretical
contributions that Indigenous peoples have made in relation to their
homelands, environments, and the matter that constitutes their material,
psychic, and spiritual lives, especially regarding ice. [[My aim
is]{.mark} not extraction]{.underline} **[but [critical
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[through]{.mark} literary
[interpretation that can hold emptiness]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[My]{.mark} careful [guesswork searches for]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark}
that [theory is built]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[not only
through]{.underline}]{.mark} something called [**[environmental
knowledge]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}]{.mark} rendered through
**[[quantifiable measurement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, hard science,
[[and]{.underline} **[policy]{.underline}** [but also
through]{.underline}]{.mark} contributions of poetry, prose, and
[[story]{.underline}]{.mark}. These forms of knowledge production, of
course, are inseparable from the web of expertise of Indigenous law and
governance. By virtue of centering ice, I am interested in environmental
expertise. [However, I illustrate that those forms of expertise can come
in a range of forms and genres]{.underline}. [To this end, this text
will not rehearse or demonstrate specific details of Arctic and
sub-Arctic Indigenous cosmologies as rich, important, distinct, and
crucial as they are across but not limited to Sámi, Nenets, Khanty,
Evenk, Even, Yukaghir, Mansi, Chukchi, Yup'ik, Unangaxˆ, Sugpiaq, Dene,
Gwich'in, Athabaskan, dAXunhyuu/Eyak, Łingít, Haida, and Inuit worlds,
territories, and lands. Often these are not mine to share or relay
without permission]{.underline}. I keep my analysis to the materials of
published creative knowledge production to bring attention to Indigenous
intellectualizing through creative knowledge production.

I'm politically and ethically drawn to what literary forms offer and
generate for articulating capacious lived and conceptual relationships,
especially with ice geographies. Literary or aesthetic modalities offer
intricate expressions without the mediation of purported objectivity.
Native literature in this context offers understandings of ice
geographies, some of which emerge from ecological expertise, but does
not risk the same problematics inherent in representing those forms of
expertise especially to a non-Native world. [Part of understanding
crucial insights and distinctions brought to bear by emplaced and
embodied knowledges and their potential creative meditations is that not
all expertise will appear and appeal in the same fashion or
universally]{.underline}. [[Such productions]{.underline}]{.mark} [[may
allow for enunciations]{.underline}]{.mark} of experience and
imagination [[that exceed]{.underline}]{.mark} typical or [[traditional
modes of communicating]{.mark} ideas [within the
academy]{.mark}]{.underline}. And yet, [as Katherine McKittrick writes,
thinking specifically with what she writes as black methodologies,
"**[science and story are not discrete]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [rather,
we know, read, create, and feel science and story
simultaneously]{.underline}."47 While quantitative forms of normative
science are often heralded as more consequential through dominant forms
of knowing and interacting with the world, story and science are not
mutually exclusive. [They have always been formed and forged together,
which is particularly resonant in thinking about literary and
theoretical Indigenous conceptualizations of the world]{.underline}. As
this text will demonstrate, [Indigenous creative knowledge production
will always make and allow for more capacious worlds, and
representations of those worlds]{.underline}. This is true also of ice
geographies and experiences of cold. For instance, as Sarah Wright and
Matalena Tofa put it:

> [Weather is . . . mediated by, and itself mediates, power
> relations]{.underline}. **[[The cold weather
> feels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, makes and is experienced
> [**[differently]{.underline}** [by homeless people living rough in a
> major US city]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or by Inuk scholar]{.mark}
> Sheila Watt-Cloutier [as she calls for the right to be cold]{.mark} to
> support the survivances of Inuit cultures and co-emergent
> environments]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} differently by a
> [small]{.mark} scale [farmer with]{.mark} an [unseasonal
> freeze]{.mark}]{.underline}, or [a [politician in a heated
> office]{.mark} making climate policy]{.underline} at the behest of oil
> companies, or [by a [glacier]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a [migrating
> bird]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[frozen grass]{.underline}]{.mark},
> the [[building's heating]{.underline}]{.mark} system
> [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[communications]{.mark} and
> co-becomings [between them]{.mark}]{.underline}.48

[[Ideas of ice as a vibrant materiality]{.mark} and cold as an affective
dimension [have been deployed differently to **service projects of
anti-Blackness** and **anti-Indigeneity** through **environmental
determinism**]{.mark} and other **colonial enterprises**. I aim to bring
attention to some of these moments.]{.underline}

Relations with ice and other matter can constitute ontological and
cosmological orientations for particular humans and polities, and such
elements can also be organized and manipulated for violent means. Such
elements can be materialities and metaphors for violence itself. As
Christina Sharpe writes, "**[[Antiblackness is pervasive as
climate]{.underline}]{.mark}**," 49 [[in concert
with]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[the totality of the environments in which
we struggle]{.mark}; the machines in which we live; [what I am **calling
the weather**]{.mark}]{.underline}."50 In the context of ice, I follow
Emilie Cameron as she puts it: "[I am not willing to abandon an analysis
of how prevailing structures and practices shape . . . relations" and
that we should be "interested in taking sides on the question of who and
what matters in **the ordering of the contemporary
North**]{.underline}."51 **[[I am interested in taking
sides]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Analyses]{.mark} of materiality
[necessitates]{.mark} a critical [engagement with violence]{.mark} yet
cannot be fully encompassed by violence alone.]{.underline}

Part of this insistence is to avoid narrative problematics that continue
to accumulate in relation to Indigenous peoples and ice. By consequence
of their long-standing relationships to ice, they are some of the first
groups to experience the consequences of a rapidly changing climate.
However, those relationships to the Arctic are extremely
underrepresented in climate change research, scholarship, and media,
especially about ice geographies. [When present, they are most commonly
narrated through crisis and devastation singularly. Many of those
narrations instead cast a depeopled, melting icescape as an iconic
representation of climate change. This melt wreaks havoc on an inferred,
doomed white, settled planet, and all the while ice remains unmoored
from its social-political origins and contexts]{.underline}. These
generalizations of ice from nowhere melting into everywhere efface
differential capitalist and colonial violences and Indigenous peoples'
political, distinct, and long-standing relationships and organizing with
ice geographies. [Recent critical work on the Arctic offers a fuller
representation of long-standing Indigenous histories and ongoing
politics]{.underline}.52 [Other contributions arrive in the form of
assessing traditional ecological knowledge (tek), Indigenous mapping, or
examining environmental literary narrations]{.underline}.53

[[There is an additional problem around]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**[renewed attention]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[multicultural liberal inclusion]{.underline}** [of **Indigenous
politics**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[polities]{.underline}**]{.mark}. If Indigenous expertise and ongoing
presence is not overlooked in the telling of ice-narratives then a
different and equally thorny narration emerges: **[[depoliticized
traditional ecological knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[which are
**sought** as **salvation**]{.mark} to a climate
apocalypse]{.underline}.54 [The [extraction of Indigenous knowledges
undermines]{.mark} the [autonomy]{.mark} of Indigenous polities [and
overlooks]{.mark} their potential [entanglements with]{.mark} resource
[extraction]{.mark}, **particularly [in the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These land-related contestations also
find home in the reductive and essentializing stereotypes about Native
people(s) and a romanticized connection to the earth. In these
formations, [Native people(s) are expected to perform an ecological
Indian stereotype that binds them to an invented hyper-spiritualized
preindustrial past]{.underline}. [This figure can never be modern and
participates in visibly mourning the changes to land wrought by
capitalism and pollution]{.underline}. However, as Kyle Whyte has
written, if our ancestors could see the state of the earth in this
moment, they would most likely be less shocked at the alterations to the
land and more surprised by institutions of patriarchy and the
mistreatment of Native femmes.55 He writes of Native ancestors:

> [It is tempting to point out that they would have commented on the
> loss of plants, animals, insects and ecosystems and the loss of
> traditional practices in the precise ways that they were performed
> during their times. But I do not think that is actually what would
> stick out to our ancestors most. Instead, they would be quite
> surprised to see the disempowerment of women and the adoption of
> heteropatriarchy in Native communities, the lack of consent and trust
> within and across peoples and nations, and the absence and triviality
> of nonhuman agency in human affairs.56]{.underline}

[The flattened land relations desired by the ecological Indian
stereotype distracts from pressing forms of relations that keep
especially those who identify as women safe, supported, and
loved---which are also forms of land relations.]{.underline}

#### Debates about the arctic should participate in ethical forms of research\-\--instead of beginning with arctic policy, working towards attentiveness to the power relations that shape what questions and areas of research seem natural, valuable and important allows debates to push against the intellectual infrastructures that participate in dispossession.

[[In emptiness]{.mark}, [there is also]{.mark}]{.underline} what I offer
as [[careful]{.mark} guessing or careful
[guesswork]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Building from critical Indigenous
studies, [guesswork honors emptiness]{.mark}, [respecting]{.mark} the
[refusals]{.mark}, the [breaks]{.mark}, the [pauses]{.mark}, the [doors
shut and]{.mark} not inspecting the [windows]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Careful guesswork also urges a form of study that is **not
extractive**, that is **desire-based**]{.underline},18 that does not
seek to build new theories that displace Indigenous theorizing.19
[[Careful guessing is]{.mark} critically [attentive to]{.mark} the
ongoing dimensions and histories of [power relations]{.mark} that
shape]{.underline} the responses to the question at hand and **[the
forms of questioning that seem possible and impossible]{.underline}**.
**[[Who and what shape my questions that seem naturalized to
me?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Careful guesswork upholds that I can guess to
the best of my knowledge, with accountability to place and peoples,20
and with an ethic of anti-coloniality and decoloniality when possible.21
Careful guesswork insists that objectivity is an impossibility, that
**[[researchers are narrators who craft compromised
stories]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We are guessing always, and our guesses
must work to be consensual among all forms of our interlocutors,
relations, and the careful guessing that has emerged before us.22

In my own guesswork, I am studying, researching, and guessing about
Indigenous ice geographies, the spatial materiality of ice, and the
experiences that ice might be having. [I cannot know with the normative
performance of certainty that is expected of a researcher. I can read,
listen, and participate thoroughly, widely, experientially and make
careful guesses.]{.underline} The work of careful guessing in relation
to nonhuman kin, entities, and collaborators is not to anthropomorphize.
[Guesswork upholds that ice geographies cannot and will not be enclosed
by the stretches of human intellectualizing or imagination]{.underline}.
Instead, [I can try to the best of my careful, critical abilities to
tell my compromised reflections of the]{.underline} **[interlocking
politics]{.underline}**, **[stories]{.underline}**,
**[histories]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[affective
embodiments]{.underline}** of and with ice geographies that existed
before I had ideas about them. As Saidiya Hartman writes of her concept
critical fabulation, [[there is a **political-ethical-moral container**
we make as our **research protocols**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is our
responsibility to write within and against]{.mark} the **[intellectual
infrastructures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that invent]{.mark} the [limits
of]{.mark} **what and [who counts]{.mark} and matters**]{.underline}.23
In careful guesswork, **[emptiness]{.underline}** [is a political
reality of the haunting of colonial theft]{.underline},24 [a choice or a
refusal]{.underline},25 [and the material embodiment of space and the
infrastructure of matter to contain emptiness]{.underline}.
[**[Emptiness]{.underline}** [does not equate to
**meaninglessness**]{.underline} [or a void to be filled with
meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[For even if this mischaracterization
were true]{.mark}, **that ice geographies are empty**, [would **they be
less worthy**]{.mark} of my time, attention, and
care**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Toward that sensibility, **[[I'm not concerned with redeeming
ice]{.mark} as meaningful]{.underline}**. [Nor do I uphold a social
vibrancy of ice, demonstrate a value of ecological vitality, or unmake
it as a wasteland]{.underline}. From where I sit, [[ice is not in need
of **redemption**]{.mark} or **valorization**]{.underline}; it has
always been and will continue to be consequential in multitudinous ways
and especially to Indigenous peoples. I am also interested in how ice
geographies and the materiality of ice have been deployed to serve
colonial enterprises of anti-Indigeneity. [My curiosity in materiality
is not to deemphasize affect or to uphold a positivistic analysis that
**necessitates material evidence as the arbiter of Truth**. I show that
the research-need for material evidence necessitates violence against
Indigenous peoples, their ancestors, and their cultural
items.]{.underline} [Oftentimes the materiality of ice and other matter
are made into evidence to prove violent theses.]{.underline}

#### Simply adding and stirring 'Arctic perspectives' to research on [better policies]{.underline} reproduces colonial modes of [resource extraction]{.underline}\-\--the objectification of the Arctic and indigenous people [subtends]{.underline} domination.

**[[TEK]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, [[is]{.mark} often [essentialized
and forced into a container as though it could exist in an
apolitical]{.mark} and ahistorical [form severed from]{.mark} the
[relations]{.mark} it co-constitutes]{.underline}. [[There is a tendency
to reduce Indigenous knowledges to something]{.underline}]{.mark} only
botanical, **[[ecological]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or somehow about
sustainability, conservation, or preservation. As Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq
argues, "Indigenous knowledges are not secondary to western,
'scientific' ones. Indeed Inuit knowledges of our lands and waters are
scientific, sovereign, and often sacred . . . these knowledges come from
our communities observing, interacting, surviving together, and
depending on the same lands and waters where our ancestors existed."62
[[There is a drive to **incorporate**]{.mark} local Indigenous
**[knowledges]{.mark}** on the ground, **[separate from political
relationships in which they are embroiled]{.mark}**, [to build]{.mark} a
[better]{.mark} set of representations for data, figures, and,
**inevitably, [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This is]{.mark} an
[inadequate]{.mark} framing as Indigenous science and knowledge sets
cannot be bracketed; they are ongoing relations and practices that are
political, juridical, and spiritual and must be consistently maintained
and reiterated]{.underline}.63 It is not Indigenous peoples'
responsibility to save what has been contemporarily cast as a dying
planet. **[[Native peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}**, communities, and
polities [[are boxed by **colonial regimes**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
make it appear as though they should save a dying earth as
mythologically, inherently land-based people---and not that they might
have their own strategies as sovereign entities who govern as they best
see fit.]{.underline}

[[One way]{.mark} that]{.underline} [**[Arctic Indigenous
knowledges]{.underline}** [have been usurped through
**add-and-stir**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[tactics of
inclusion]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark} through scientific
[research]{.mark} projects that laud collaborative methodologies
[without **meaningful**]{.mark} engagement and
**[representation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2020,
[Kawerak]{.underline}, Inc., a regional nonprofit corporation serving
the Bering Straits Region [organized under the auspices of]{.underline}
**[ANCSA]{.underline}**, [wrote a letter addressed to the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**ational **[S]{.underline}**cience
**[F]{.underline}**oundation['s]{.underline} [polar program]{.underline}
**[[Navigating the New Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(**[NNA]{.underline}**). [The letter [indicted **poor research
practices**]{.mark}]{.underline} and included statements such as:

> We cannot overstate the need for true collaboration among Indigenous
> Peoples . . . we have grave concerns about the impacts from the NNA
> process and funded projects to date. [The NNA has funded projects that
> claim .  .  . to be collaborative, to do knowledge co-production, to

> questions that will 'help' or 'assist' Arctic residents]{.underline}.
> [Many of these projects]{.underline} (and many more which were not
> funded) **[do not and will not fulfill any of those
> claims]{.underline}**.64

This important statement resonates with Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq's urgent
call for equitable, meaningful collaboration with Indigenous peoples in
Arctic science research. Itchuaqiyaq writes,

> [I have been researched. My family has been researched. [We have given

[[These calls for responsible]{.mark} scientific [engagement]{.mark}
with Arctic Indigenous communities [don't arrive from nowhere]{.mark}.
In this moment of climate change, the most dominant form of ordering and
narrating ice geographies is made through understanding ice as a
scientific dataset. [Ice]{.mark} as a material for objective
laboratorial analysis [is]{.mark} often [severed from]{.mark} the
[political and social contexts]{.mark} from which it was removed toward
the goal of telling planetary stories]{.underline}. Scientific data has
long been extracted from the Arctic and continues in contemporary forms
such as through drone imagery and satellite data that tracks sea ice
melt and glacial retreat.66 The technologies to surveil, track,
speculate, and predict ice melt seem to proliferate with the minute.

#### Arctic [incorporation]{.underline} into frames of [policy-change]{.underline} and USFG action reproduce indigenous peoples are [resources]{.underline} to save a [white planet]{.underline}\-\--refuse Arctic [universality]{.underline} in favor of modes of [unsettling]{.underline} Arctic research. 

**Smith 20**, dAXunhyuu geographer, assistant professor at University of
Washington. (Jen Rose; 2020, ""Exceeding Beringia": Upending universal
human events and wayward transits in Arctic spaces," Environment &
Planning D: Society and Space, SAGE Publishing)

To interrogate this historical phenomenon, I offer the concept
temperate-normativity, which demonstrates how
**["[proper]{.mark}"]{.underline}** [[civilizations]{.underline} [are
said to arise from settlements]{.underline}]{.mark} [in temperate
locales that depend largely on cultivation via agricultural
practices]{.underline}. **[[Sedentarism]{.underline}]{.mark}** through
agricultural practice [[becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[universal
indicator]{.mark} and foundation for civilization]{.underline}**. Under
this rubric, [ice]{.underline}, in its resistance to root and hostility
to settlement, [is said to not only **racialize**]{.underline} [due to
"extreme" climate but the [Arctic]{.mark} also [becomes a space where
**pathological migrancy**]{.mark}]{.underline} and transit [[takes
place]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such narrations enmesh within the Bering
Land Bridge Theory wherein waves of human migrations are said to have
moved through the Arctic on the way to temperate zones, and those who
linger are exceptional and aberrant. Within this explanation,
**[[indigeneity becomes a temporal question]{.mark},]{.underline}** [and
Indigenous peoples who reside in the Arctic are read as recent arrivals
from elsewhere]{.underline}. [Temperate-normativity is also latent
within dominant conversations of the Anthropocene, [where the Arctic
becomes a space of consequence for **all humans equally** under]{.mark}
the **[conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} its [melting
unsettles]{.mark} a temperate world]{.underline}. Within such universal
explanations [that utilize the **Arctic uncritically**]{.underline} as
both setting and protagonist, [the specificities of Indigenous political
autonomies and their ongoing relationalities with one another and
more-than-human kin go overlooked and are **therefore made more
precarious**]{.underline}.

[To rethink co-optations of **Arctic space**]{.underline} [as
demonstrating something **inherently universal**]{.underline} about
human origins, endings, and land use along the way, I turn to poet Joan
Naviyuk Kane (Inupiaq) and her poem "Exceeding Beringia" (2016). Kane's
work undermines universal narrations of humanity's migration story
across a phantomatic land bridge and into the modern moment of climate
crisis. For the Arctic, scientific discourse and data collection operate
as dominant, and often preferred, forms of knowledge production that
draw conclusions about a changing climate, and about the origin and
migrations of humans. [A turn toward poetry as a form of evidence upends
an overreliance on Science as arbiter of truth both in a climate crisis
and toward a conclusion of human origins. Therefore, Kane's poetry
creates space and opportunity for long existing and complex
relationships to the Arctic come to the fore.]{.underline}

In considering Kane's poem alongside 18th century Natural History
capitulations, [I employ **transit** as a critique of **sedentarist
metaphysics**]{.underline}, [or the notion that to be fixed in space is
a necessary precondition of successful civilization]{.underline}
(Malkki, 1992). [Transit is not only a source of a critique but it is
also a mode of analysis]{.underline} (Byrd, 2011). [Transits and traffic
between poetry and Natural History abound, particularly so in the 18th
century and onward, where poetic reflections on land and landscape rub
elbows with geology, archaeology, and ethnology
documentations]{.underline} (Carter, 1987; Pratt, 1992; Schiebinger and
Swan, 2005). To place Kane's work in proximity to Natural Historian
reflections, then, is not unusual, but is one analysis of the transit of
ideas, world-making, and worldinterruptions (Lorde, 2007). "Exceeding
Beringia" works toward the action of its title by centering a kinship of
seasonal transit among red phalarope and Inupiat in Arctic spaces that
complicate temperate-normative ideas of unilinear directionality of both
human migrations and geologic time. [Furthermore, offering poetics as a
counterpoint to over-determined climate Science helps to reimagine an
Arctic geography that is not circumscribed to quantitative data alone
but offers a vibrancy both discursive and material, human and
morethan-human]{.underline} (McKittrick, 2006; Million, 2011).

In the next section I examine the specificities of Arctic ice and its
role in contemporary Anthropocene conversations to demonstrate how
**[[ice is currently enlisted to tell overarching stories about
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I then show that these enlistments are
as historical as they are ongoing. I bring together multiple 18th
century temperate-normative musings about the racializing effects of the
"extreme" nature of Northern environments that supposedly shape
inferiority, which is also read as a pathological migrancy due to
perpetual transits imposed by land bridge ideas. To interrupt these
multiple overlapping formations that utilize Arctic ice without critical
engagement, in the final section I analyze Kane's poem "Exceeding
Beringia" as a world-making narrative of emplaced historical and ongoing
relationships in geographies thought by many to be only for movement
through and not within.

Ice and the Anthropocene

While interest in ice has erupted in a current moment of rapid climate
change, ice---and [[Arctic ice]{.mark} in
particular]{.underline}---[[has]{.mark} long [been]{.mark} a
[focal]{.mark} [point of study for scientific knowledge
production]{.mark} and has held a key foothold [in imperial Western
cultural imagination]{.mark}]{.underline} (Blum, 2019; Dodds, 2018;
Wilson, 2003). Scholars have critiqued representation and reportage of
ice as blank, barren, and empty, or ice as essentially ahistorical and
disconnected from ongoing socialities (Bravo, 2018; Davidson, 2005;
Grace, 2001). [A range of [work]{.mark} has [intervened to
rewrite]{.mark} the [Arctic as]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} ecological
[ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bravo and Rees, 2006), as a space where
white masculinity and nationalism is tested (Bloom, 1993; Robinson,
2006), either verified or foiled (Craciun, 2016), [[and]{.mark} as a
[geopolitical zone that defies]{.mark} bureaucratic [clarity]{.mark} as
neither land nor water]{.underline} (Steinberg et al., 2015).

[The Arctic has also been writ as a space of historical human activity,
in particular in regard to archaeological research that aims to evidence
large-scale theories of human migrations through the Arctic to other
climes, largely in exit from Africa or East Asia]{.underline} (Graf and
Buvit, 2017; Turnbull, 2010). Material scientific data have long been
extracted from the Arctic (Bravo and Sorlin, 2002), and continues in
contemporary forms such as through icecore technologies (Antonello and
Carey, 2017; Elzinga, 2017), as well as drone imagery and satellite data
that track ice melt. [[While]{.mark} much [Arctic]{.mark} scholarship
[attends to Western presences]{.mark}, more recent work offers a fuller
inclusion of longstanding Indigenous histories and ongoing
politics]{.underline} (Banerjee, 2012; Cameron, 2015; Cruikshank, 2006;
Huntington et al., 2019; Routledge, 2018; Stuhl, 2016). Often these
contributions arrive in the form of assessing traditional ecological
knowledge, Indigenous mapping, or examining literary narrations (Aporta
et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2016; Kollin, 2001; Krupnik et al., 2010).

[These [transdisciplinary contributions]{.mark} of ice-analytics
[offer]{.mark} a [characterization of ice]{.mark} as a materiality that
is [uneasily categorized by perceptions]{.mark} of the colonial or
theoretical: **[ice does not produce agriculture]{.mark}, it does not
give root, [it does not generate arborescence, it is not
rhizomatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Ice is a conundrum across academic
disciplines; it confounds an aesthetic determinacy through lens or by
brush]{.underline}. Immensity of glacier and icefield remains an
artistic puzzle and representational bane (Balog, 2012; Bloom and
Glasberg, 2011). [Ice is slow and plodding as it shifts, breaks, melts,
and hardens, though scholars and artists often dramatize its
precarity]{.underline}. Within dominant conversations of the
Anthropocene, **[[ice is made a focal point as its melting is a danger
to a temperate world.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The crisis of climate change animating Anthropocene discourse is
explicit and straightforward: human-made environmental destruction is
immediately identifiable. Yet, many analytical offerings of the
Anthropocene are inadequate as they authorize a universal truth of how
the Arctic must be known, depicted, and managed. Dominant Anthropocene
discussions are constituted by three overlapping formations. [First, as
a Science that works to "save humanity" from a self-induced catastrophic
crisis]{.underline} (Chakrabarty, 2009). [Second, as a bureaucracy that
works to attend fully to claims of sovereignty by primarily colonial
nation-states and secondarily, if at all, to Indigenous
polities]{.underline} (Shadian, 2014; Zellen, 2008, 2009). [And third,
through a liberal multiculturalism that allows for multi-dimensional
aesthetic portrayals of the Arctic to exist simultaneously and
equally]{.underline}. Within the latter is a niche narration of
Indigenous peoples as apolitical and often ahistorical, repeating tropes
that herald alternative qualities of uninterrupted Indigenous lifeways
within Arctic spaces. [[This inclusion of "the alternative" articulates
Arctic Indigenous peoples not as so many autonomous sovereign polities,
but]{.mark} as a potential [resource of land-based knowledges]{.mark}
[that can recover a global "we" from self-inflicted destruction]{.mark}.
[Within this capitulation, the death **of a white**,]{.mark} temperate
[**planet** might be salvaged by]{.mark} an orchestrated return of a set
of **[once subjugated knowledges]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Anthropocene as the (unofficial) latest geologic epoch (Crutzen,
2002) has been roundly problematized (Baldwin and Erickson, 2020; Fagan,
2019; Ojeda et al., 2020; Simpson, 2020; Tsing et al., 2017; Tuana,
2019; Verges, 2017; Yusoff, 2019). Scholars critique the colonial,
racist foundations of the Anthropocene discourse and call for careful
interrogations of which sets of humanity must be held accountable for
capitalist activities that contribute most to a changing climate.
Franc¸iose Verges (2017) puts it most succinctly writing that the
Anthropocene is an easy story to tell, "because it does not challenge
the naturalized inequalities, alienation, and violence inscribed in
modernity's strategic relations of power and production." Bringing
attention to the white supremacist and anti-black underpinnings of the
Anthropocene, Verges invokes a more apt term "racial capitalocene" to
assess the current state of the world.

Similarly, Zoe Todd and Heather Davis argue that extractive logics of
climate change must be read as emerging from within conditions of longue
duree coloniality. They write that, "Indigenous philosophies and
processes of Indigenous self-governance as a necessary political
corrective, alongside the self-determination of other communities and
societies violently impacted by white supremacists, colonial, and
capitalist logics instantiated in the origins of the Anthropocene"
(Davis and Todd, 2017: 763). [In addition to accounting for the
violences intrinsic to capitalist relations, scholars also draw
attention to more-than-human kinships that have long animated Indigenous
socialities despite capitalist interventions]{.underline} (Davis and
Todd, 2017; Pulido, 2018; TallBear, 2017; Todd, 2015; Whyte, 2017). One
method of undermining a universal humanist position inherent within
dominant Anthropocene scholarship is to cultivate practices that serve
and attend to particularities and distinct historicities of relations
and coloniality embedded in place. [[Such practices disallow]{.mark} a
[managerial Science from maintaining authority and]{.mark} require an
adherence to the sovereignties of Indigenous polities, however they take
shape]{.underline}. One such practice, offered here, is an attendance to
poetic imaginings and articulations of space and sociality sidelined in
favor of more "legible" climate data.

[**[Within]{.mark} Anthropocene [conversations]{.mark}**, [ice]{.mark}
in particular [gets de-linked from the social histories of]{.mark} its
[origins and]{.mark} is [made to serve]{.mark} as **[evidence of]{.mark}
a [shared]{.mark} global [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As often as one
might see a melting glacier divorced from its socio-political context,
so too are many floating theories or critiques of the Anthropocene
unmoored from material stakes. In the following section, I analyze 18th
century Natural History descriptions of ice as a materiality and
geography to demonstrate how ice has been weaponized to produce a
subject that is categorized as racially inferior and pathologically in
transit. This transit is due to the extreme nature of ice-landscapes and
spatial proximity to a landform that is thought by some to have once
bridged continents.

[[Scholarship and research about]{.underline}

[[animates]{.mark} much of [Native studies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[Law]{.underline}** [is where land]{.underline}, [its
dispossession]{.underline}, [and colonial land relations]{.underline}
**[unfold and continue to be enacted]{.underline}**. Again, and more
importantly, Native communities have their own legal systems, legal
obligations, protocols, and practices that both predate colonial contact
and have been shaped, maintained, and revised in relation to gendered
colonial encroachment and dispossession.21 [[Native peoples']{.mark}
social organization and [political structures]{.mark} are vast and
diverse and [preexist]{.mark} any other form of [current]{.mark} federal
or state systems of [law]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Native studies]{.mark}
analyses [recognize]{.mark} this reality and are also interested in the
important ongoing problematics of]{.underline} signed,
**[[broken]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and unhonored
**[[treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[[land
cessions]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[allotment]{.underline}**; the
**[[theft of Native children]{.underline}]{.mark}** from Native
families; murdered, **[[missing Indigenous women]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and girls (mmiwg); [[and]{.underline} **[myriad
land]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and water [claims
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To make claims to land legible to
colonial governments, Native people(s) were often forced and coerced to
articulate themselves and their relationships to land in ways that were
deemed satisfactorily recognizable as Indigenous. [[These regimes of
recognition continue into the contemporary moment]{.mark} as some tribes
continue to **seek federal recognition**]{.underline}.22 Through this
centuries-long process, [[colonial courts]{.mark} have [created a
**politics of recognition**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that require Native
peoples to adhere **to a definition of fixedness**]{.mark} in space
[and]{.mark} a [long-**standing temporal**]{.mark} and **material
[attachment]{.mark} to land**]{.underline}.23

[[Land must be made **recognizable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[legible]{.underline}**]{.mark} [alongside formations of **indigeneity
and race**]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} often [excludes entities like
ice]{.mark}, river, and ocean]{.underline}. [Settler legal systems
require]{.underline} an articulated **[rootedness]{.underline}** and
fixedness in place, [countering]{.underline} **[many Native origin
stories]{.underline}** and cosmologies [that include ice, water, ocean,
and migrations across and between]{.underline},24 [as well as ongoing
Indigenous mobilities.]{.underline}25 Moreover, **[[the legal legibility
that requires stasis]{.underline}]{.mark}** and sedentarism
simultaneously [[necessitates]{.underline}
**[Western]{.underline}**]{.mark} forms of
**[[cultivation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and agriculture
[[through]{.underline} **[fertile soil and ground]{.underline}**]{.mark}
in which to root---[[something that ice geographies cannot

through **settler law**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} so must
**[land]{.underline}**, [and [that **rendering legible of
land**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[peoples are related
processes]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The articulation of land, race, and
political subjectivity through law iterated in documents like treaties
and land claims settlements later shape how ice and Indigenous peoples
who live with or near ice are juridically understood or misunderstood.
[The strategic deployments of land can have deleterious consequences for
peoples of water and ice who aim to use similar legal avenues toward
care of relations.]{.underline}

The strategic, and often necessary, utilization of accepted colonial
interpretation of what counts as land and land relations has resulted in
keeping some homelands intact, yet it is not without consequences. As
Goeman writes,

> To claim land, it is set up through the court systems that we must
> claim difference from settlers. In our pursuit to differentiate
> ourselves from settler colonists, we have territorialized land and
> body. The legal tensions between stability and static versus change,
> adaptation, and growth are very real for indigenous people. [They are
> in a particularly difficult political situation in which recognition
> of cultural and racial uniqueness is detrimental to the overall
> physical and cultural survival of indigenous people]{.underline}.26

These kinds of land relations framed through a categorical difference
from whiteness as enforced and determined by settler law are at once the
mechanism that allows Native peoples to claim their land and also
creates harm in an identification of self and community. [The original
moment of articulating difference from colonists to make claims to
homeland is not a singular event. This difference must be reiterated
over time to maintain access to land and things like treaty rights.
**[Legal relationships to land are also not
homogenous.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The opportunity to legally claim difference from colonists as precedent
for land claims and land rights, such as in Alaska, Hawaii, and in many
places in California, does not always exist. In many places, no treaties
were signed, and there is no legal or priority access for Native peoples
to their land relations. [In Alaska, [legal conflict over]{.mark} what
are called "[subsistence rights]{.mark}" (access to whaling, fishing,
hunting, and gathering) [continues]{.mark} into the contemporary
moment]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} Alaska [Native people]{.mark}
demonstrated and [lobbied]{.mark} for their subsistence rights, [those
rights were denied]{.mark} by state legislature [as]{.mark}
unconstitutional, [race-based privileges]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Herein
lies one dimension of the problematic identified by Goeman: when rights
are articulated through **racial difference in settler courts, they can
also be denied on those same grounds**]{.underline}. However, in the
case of Alaska, [[the denial]{.mark} of subsistence rights [flies in the
face of subsistence access legally falling under]{.mark} the auspices of
[federal]{.mark} Indian [law]{.mark}, not a state-level
decision]{.underline}.27

[**[Anti-Indigeneity]{.underline}** [that operates to
remove]{.underline} **[Native peoples]{.underline}**]{.mark} from their
lands [continues the need to further centralize the importance of
land]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} need, [unfortunately]{.underline},
[[also]{.mark} potentially [minimizes]{.mark} conceptual space allowed
for **[water and ice]{.mark}**]{.underline} and an analysis of how these
elements cannot come into categorial formation in ways that land is
afforded. Put another way, the colonial category of land as easily
measured or captured by technology and law can disallow other categories
and relations, like water and ice, to be claimed. Thus, [Native studies
must continue to support Native polities' processes of land reclamation
while simultaneously contesting the legitimacy of settler-colonial
governments to determine such meanings]{.underline}. The urgency within
the field toward land reflects the urgency of the politics on the
ground. [[The feedback loop of land relations, land theft, land rights,
land claims, land back, land scholarship is a loop precisely because of
the ongoing elements of land dispossession and enacted
coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, because of the precarity
around land dispossession and the need to continually articulate land
relations in forms legible to settler courts, scholarship in Native
studies that pushes inquiries around reframing land differently can be
read as dangerous and potentially against grounded movements. [**With**
this **important** **reality** in mind, I **worry** about the
**colonial** grounding of the concept of land that **forces** it to
**carry everything** we **ask** it to. We **need** to **blur** the

Abstract

**[[If methods are how we answer research questions]{.mark}, [then
theories are how we know what question to ask]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Therefore, [**[all research]{.underline}** [begins
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a necessarily **[high]{.underline}** level of
[**[abstraction]{.underline}** [which]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[informs decisions about]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[appropriate
[targets, goals, and scale]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[at which methods are
carried out]{.mark}.]{.underline} Numerous critics have argued that
fieldwork should not be extractive, meaning it should not collect data
for the benefit of the researcher without returning anything to the
community. The distinction between the "abstract" and the "on the
ground" work done by geographers is thus far from distinct. In this
essay, I discuss questions about how to do fieldinformed research of
intellectual value that is neither extractive nor perpetuates colonial
imaginaries of spaces of problem and solution. While a single essay
cannot answer these questions, I use research involving northern
Canadian communities, and in particular, my own focus group research on
the cultural politics of diamond mining in Nunavut, to add clarity to
these questions. Ultimately, I argue that methods not only should be
flexible and tailored to theory but also should be "field informed" in
the sense that informants help researchers shape reflexive accounts by
highlighting what is unknown, unknowable, or situationally contingent.

Introduction

In his excellent critique of social science methodology After Method,
Law (2004) argues that because [the world is not only difficult to
comprehend but also quite possibly complex beyond our ability to
adequately comprehend it]{.underline}, [**[we need a broader suite of
methods]{.underline}** [to apprehend]{.underline}]{.mark}[, relate to,
[and]{.mark} to [express what we do come to know]{.mark} about
it.]{.underline} More specifically, he says it is those realities that
are ephemeral and sometimes contradictory that are beyond the scope of
traditional social science methods. As such, rather than the
**[[traditional]{.underline}]{.mark}** rigidity and
**[[standardization]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[too conflated with academic
rigor]{.underline}]{.mark}, he argues that [[methods need to be]{.mark}
sufficiently [flexible]{.mark} and adapted to the particular research
project at hand]{.underline}. I agree with that point, and in this
article, I will use my experience researching the cultural politics of
diamond mining in northern Canada to both illustrate and expand upon
Law's observations.1

In short, I ran a series of focus groups in the Inuit village of
Kugluktuk, Nunavut, in 2011, as part of a project to triangulate the
history and practices of the global diamond industry, their construction
of Canadian diamonds as "ethical" alternatives to African diamonds
vis-à-vis images of polar bears, ice bergs, snowy white landscapes,
maple leaves, etc., and the reaction to the above by residents of
Kugluktuk, which exists about 425 km down the Coppermine River from
three of Canada's four diamond mines. This research, buttressed by
semistructured interviews and archival research, has been published
elsewhere (Schlosser 2013a, 2013b). Focus groups have a number of
advantages in such a context, especially their ability to facilitate
intragroup communication (Litosseliti 2003). Rather than extol the
benefits of one particular method, I prefer to begin with a brief story
of a particular focus group experience that exhibited the "messiness" of
which Law (2004) speaks. One focus group consisted of two sisters, Katie
and Kristin, 23 years and 20 years, respectively.2 They were asked to
react to a series of advertisements for Canadian diamond companies, such
as Maple Leaf Diamonds and Eskimo Diamonds, the former of which
portrayed Arctic Canada as a barren, valueless plain with hidden
treasures waiting to be unearthed by southern mining companies, and the
latter of which invited consumers of diamonds to identify with "Eskimos"
perfectly in tune with their environments. They were also asked about
their impression of mines (diamond or otherwise) and their impact on
their community. Of the sisters, Katie was more gregarious, though
generally less critical of the advertisements. Kristin spoke only after
her older sister, seldom made eye contact with me, and, perhaps regarded
me as a teacher and herself as a pupil in a classroom environment
(precisely the dynamic focus groups are intended to avoid), seemed to
search for what might be the "correct" answer. Kristin was bright and
articulate, but seemed unsure of herself. However, at the end of the
session, I asked the sisters if they had any more questions for me (as
per protocol), and Kristin immediately locked eye contact, sat up, and
confidently questioned my intention in Kugluktuk, remarking "Yes, what
are *you* going to do with this research?" (Her emphasis squarely on the
"you").

This story is instructive for my purposes for two reasons. First, it
illustrates **[methodological]{.underline}**
"**[messiness]{.underline}**," as what I first interpreted as
nervousness in the presence of an older (than Kristin), white, male
outsider may well have in fact been reluctance to discuss her community
(with said outsider). This [is]{.underline} precisely [why methods need
to be adaptable and flexible]{.underline}, as Law (2004) argues. Second,
and more importantly for this essay, Kristin's question shoots to the
core of the most fundamental issue involved with cultural geography
research in Arctic Canada, or indigenous communities anywhere: the role
of the researcher vis-à-vis the data being sought in the community. More
on this follows. For now, let me suggest that [this relationship extends
far beyond methods and even beyond methodology. It is fundamentally a
question of the dominance of empiricist epistemology in the social
sciences, as evidenced by the hegemonic "devotion in geography to
**experience**, **fieldwork**, and **data**"]{.underline} (Wainwright
2012, p. xiii; italics in original). [The basic difference between
methods and theory is that **[methods are how we answer]{.mark} a given
question**]{.underline}, [whereas [theory is **how we know what question
to ask**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kristin, like many Inuks, was no stranger
to research, and her question confronted the basic assumption of
empiricist epistemology---that her words were the data to be secured and
to which value would be added by the researcher somewhere else. This is
an issue of extraction. [[That empiricist relationship takes for granted
the questions needing to be asked]{.underline}]{.mark}, [making the
problematic Kristin raises more a theoretical than a methodological
one]{.underline}. While Law (2004) is right to say we need flexible
methods, [I would argue that his book is as much a call for informed and
**flexible theory**.]{.underline} [I would add to his analysis that
[tailoring methods to rigorously informed theory enables]{.mark} that
[flexibility]{.mark}. **[This is an issue of abstraction]{.mark}**,
hence my title.]{.underline}

While I answered Kristin's question to her satisfaction, in this essay I
will attempt to answer it in a more discipline-relevant register.
Hereafter, I offer a critique of the relationship between researchers
and communities as refracted through hegemonic empiricist epistemology,
and a few comments on how my use of focus groups as method (an empirical
one) is informed by and tailored to this theoretical critique. In the
next section, I further explain this critique in terms of how it fits
with broader theoretical trends in cultural geography, and in the
section following that I explain how these issues manifest in cultural
geography research in northern Canadian communities, including my own.

global environmental change research," Progress in Human Geography,

Glaciers are icons of global climate change, with common representations
stripping them of social and cultural contexts to portray ice as
simplified climate change yardsticks and thermometers. [[In
geophysicist]{.underline}]{.mark} Henry Pollack's
[[articulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, '**[[Ice asks no
questions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, presents no arguments, reads no
newspapers, **[[listens to no debates]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It is not
burdened by ideology and carries no political baggage as it crosses the
threshold from solid to liquid]{.underline}. **[[It just
melts']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Pollack, 2009: 114). [[This]{.mark}
perspective]{.underline} **[[appears]{.mark} consistently [in public
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**, from media to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). [But [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**['ice
is just ice' conceptualization]{.underline}**
[contrasts]{.underline}]{.mark} sharply [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
conclusions by [[researchers]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Cruikshank
(2005), [[who asks if glaciers listen]{.underline}]{.mark}, Orlove et
al. (2008b), [[who analyze]{.mark} the [cultural framing]{.mark} of
glaciers]{.underline}, Carey (2007), [who sees an endangered species
narrative applied to glaciers]{.underline}, Jackson (2015), [who exposes
how glaciers are depicted as ruins]{.underline}, and So¨rlin (2015),
[who refers to the present as a cryo-historical moment]{.underline}
because 'ice has become historical, i.e. that ice is an element of
change and thus something that can be considered as part of society and
of societal concern' (So¨rlin, 2015: 327).

Nu¨sser and Baghel (2014) also reject the 'ice is just ice' assertion.
**[[Glaciers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, they argue, '[[have increasingly
become]{.underline}]{.mark} contested and [**[controversial objects of
knowledge]{.underline}**, [susceptible to]{.underline}]{.mark} cultural
[**[framings]{.underline}** [as both **dangerous** and **endangered
landscapes'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nu¨sser and Baghel, 2014: 138).
Glaciers, after all, affect people worldwide by influencing sea level,
providing water for drinking and agriculture, generating hydroelectric
energy from glacier runoff, triggering natural disasters, yielding rich
climate data from ice cores, shaping religious beliefs and cultural
values, constituting identities, inspiring art and literature, and
driving tourist economies that affect local populations and travelers
alike (e.g. Carey, 2010; Cruikshank, 2005; Gosnell, 2005; Hewitt, 2014c;
Orlove et al., 2008a). Despite their perceived remoteness, **[[glaciers
are central sites]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- often contested and
multifaceted -- experiencing the effects of global change,
[[where]{.mark} science, [policy]{.mark}, [knowledge]{.mark}, [and
society interact]{.mark} in dynamic social-ecological
systems]{.underline}. Today, there is a need for a much more profound
analysis of societies living in and engaging with mountains and cold
regions (Halvorson, 2002; Byers and Sainju, 1994; Bloom et al., 2008),
including the social, economic, political, cultural, epistemological,
and religious aspects of glaciers (see e.g. Allison, 2015; Gagne´ et
al., 2014).

[A critical but overlooked aspect of]{.underline} the **[human
dimensions]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} glaciers and **[global change
research]{.underline}** [is the relationship between gender and
glaciers]{.underline}. [While there has been relatively little research
on gender and global environmental change in general]{.underline} (Moosa
and Tuana, 2014; Arora-Jonsson, 2011), there is even less from a
feminist perspective that focuses on gender (understood here not as a
male/female binary, but as a range of personal and social possibilities)
[and also on power, justice, inequality, and knowledge production in the
context of ice, glacier change, and glaciology]{.underline} (exceptions
are Bloom et al., 2008; Williams and Golovnev, 2015; Hevly, 1996; Hulbe
et al., 2010; Cruikshank, 2005). [Feminist theories and **critical
epistemologies**]{.underline} -- especially feminist political ecology
and feminist postcolonial science studies -- [open up new
**perspectives** and **analyses**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the
history of glaciological **[knowledge]{.underline}**. Researchers in
feminist political ecology and feminist geography (e.g. Sultana, 2014;
Mollett and Faria, 2013; Elmhirst, 2011; Coddington, 2015) have also
called for studies to move 'beyond gender', to include analyses of
power, justice, and knowledge production as well as 'to unsettle and
challenge dominant assumptions' that are often embedded in Eurocentric
knowledges (Harris, 2015: xx). [Given the prominent place of glaciers
both within the social imaginary of climate change and in global
environmental change research, a feminist approach has important
present-day relevance for understanding the dynamic relationship between
people and ice -- what Nu¨sser and Baghel (2015) refer to as the
cryoscape]{.underline}.

Through a review and synthesis of a multi-disciplinary and wide-ranging
literature on human-ice relations, [[this paper
proposes]{.underline}]{.mark} a feminist glaciology
[**[framework]{.underline}** [to analyze]{.underline}]{.mark}
human-glacier **[[dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, glacier narratives
[[and discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and claims
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} credibility and [**[authority]{.underline}**
[of glaciological knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} through the lens of
feminist studies. [As a point of departure, we use 'glaciology' in an
encompassing sense that exceeds the immediate scientific meanings of the
label, much as feminist critiques of geography, for example, have
expanded what it is that 'geography' might mean vis-a\`-vis geographic
knowledge]{.underline} (Domosh, 1991; Rose, 1993). As such, feminist
glaciology has four aspects: (1) knowledge producers, to decipher how
gender affects the individuals producing glacierrelated knowledges; (2)
gendered science and knowledge, to address how glacier science,
perceptions, and claims to credibility are gendered; (3) systems of
scientific domination, to analyze how power, domination, colonialism,
and control -- undergirded by and coincident with masculinist ideologies
-- have shaped glacier-related sciences and knowledges over time; and
(4) alternative representations, to illustrate diverse methods and ways
-- beyond the natural sciences and including what we refer to as 'folk
glaciologies' -- to portray glaciers and integrate counter-narratives
into broader conceptions of the cryosphere. These four components of
feminist glaciology not only help to critically uncover the
under-examined history of glaciological knowledge and glacier-related
sciences prominent in today's climate change discussions. The
[[framework]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
important [[implications for understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}
vulnerability, adaptation, and [[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} -- all
central themes in global environmental change research and
decision-making that have lacked such robust analysis of epistemologies
and knowledge production (Conway et al., 2014; Castree et al., 2014).

II Why feminist glaciology?

[Feminist glaciology asks how knowledge related to glaciers is produced,
circulated, and gains credibility and authority across time and
space]{.underline}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously [[brings to
the forefront]{.underline} **[glacier knowledge]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that has been [**[marginalized]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[deemed
'outside']{.underline}**]{.mark} of traditional glaciology. It asks how
glaciers came to be meaningful and significant (through what ontological
and epistemological process), as well as trying **[[to destabilize
underlying assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** about ice and environment
through the dismantling of a host of boundaries and binaries. The
feminist lens is crucial given the historical marginalization of women,
the importance of gender in glacierrelated knowledges, and the ways in
which systems of colonialism, imperialism, and patriarchy co-constituted
gendered science. Additionally, the feminist perspective seeks to
uncover and embrace marginalized knowledges and alternative narratives,
which are increasingly needed for effective global environmental change
research, including glaciology (Castree et al., 2014; Hulme, 2011). A
combination of feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist
political ecology provide the intellectual foundation for feminist
glaciology.

[Most existing glaciological research -- and hence discourse and
discussions about cryospheric change -- stems from information produced
by men, about men, with manly characteristics, and within masculinist
discourses]{.underline}. These characteristics apply to scientific
disciplines beyond glaciology; there is an explicit need to uncover the
role of women in the history of science and technology, while also
exposing processes for excluding women from science and technology
(Phillips and Phillips, 2010; Domosh, 1991; Rose, 1993). Harding (2009)
explains that the absence of women in science critically shapes 'the
selection of scientific problems, hypotheses to be tested, what
constituted relevant data to be collected, how it was collected and
interpreted, the dissemination and consequences of the results of
research, and who was credited with the scientific and technological
work' (Harding, 2009: 408). Scientific studies themselves can also be
gendered, especially when credibility is attributed to research produced
through typically masculinist activities or manly characteristics, such
as heroism, risk, conquests, strength, self-sufficiency, and exploration
(Terrall, 1998). The tendency to exclude women and emphasize masculinity
thus has far-reaching effects on science and knowledge, including
glaciology and glacierrelated knowledges.

Feminist glaciology is rooted in, and combines, both feminist science
studies and postcolonial science studies to meaningfully shift
present-day glacier and ice sciences. While feminist science studies
focuses explicitly on gender and the place (or absence) of women in
science, it can neglect specific analyses of the social relations of
colonialism and imperialism, emphasizing instead Western women without
sustained attention to indigenous, non-Western, and local knowledge
systems that are the centerpiece of postcolonial science studies
(Harding, 2009; Phillips and Phillips, 2010; Schnabel, 2014). [The
postcolonial perspective is crucial for understanding glaciological
knowledges because the science of glaciology has historically
participated in the imperialist, colonial, and capitalist projects
associated with polar exploration, mountain colonization, resource
extraction, and Cold War and other geopolitical endeavors.]{.underline}

More recently, glaciology has also been central to earth systems science
that often relies on remote sensing from satellite imagery to suggest
broader claims of objectivity but is actually akin to the 'god trick of
seeing everything from nowhere' (Haraway, 1988: 581; also see Shapin,
1998). [[Questions about epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} in climate
science, ice coring, and glaciology **[[are only beginning to be
asked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially focusing on Cold War polar
glaciology [(Martin-Nielsen, 2012, 2013; Elzinga, 2009; Korsmo, 2010;
Naylor et al., 2008; Turchetti et al., 2008; Macdougall, 2004; Finnegan,
2004; Heymann et al., 2010; Bowen, 2005; Hulme, 2010).]{.underline} Of
these studies probing the discipline of glaciology, only a tiny subset
analyze gender (exceptions include Bloom, 1993; Bloom et al., 2008;
Hulbe et al., 2010; Hevly, 1996) or approach humanglacier interactions
from the perspective of feminist postcolonial science studies or
feminist political ecology (exceptions include Williams and Golovnev,
2015; Cruikshank, 2005). [Fewer still recognize indigenous knowledges,
local perspectives, or alternative narratives of glaciers, even though
large populations of non-Western and indigenous peoples inhabit mountain
and cold regions near glaciers and possess important knowledge about
cryoscapes]{.underline} (Carey et al., 2015; Nu¨sser and Baghel, 2014;
Drew, 2012).

Feminist and postcolonial theories enrich and complement each other by
showing how gender and colonialism are co-constituted, as well as how
both women and indigenous peoples have been marginalized historically
(Schnabel, 2014). Feminist glaciology builds from feminist postcolonial
science studies, analyzing not only gender dynamics and situated
knowledges, but also alternative knowledges and folk glaciologies that
are generally marginalized through colonialism, imperialism, inequality,
unequal power relations, patriarchy, and the domination of Western
science (Harding, 2009).

An additional theoretical foundation for feminist glaciology is feminist
political ecology, which has generally emphasized unequal vulnerability
and disproportionate global change impacts, but which also contributes
significant research on knowledge production, ontologies, and
epistemologies. With hundreds of millions of people utilizing glaciers
for everything from drinking water and hydroelectricity to recreation
and spiritual sites, the disproportionate vulnerabilities and disparate
adaptive capacities in these societies are critical to acknowledge.
[Feminist political ecology addresses how **[inequality and unequal
power relations]{.mark}** -- mediated and co-constituted through gender
dynamics -- [have **silenced**]{.mark} the **knowledge** of
[people]{.mark} 'most affected and marginalized by neoliberal, colonial,
and patriarchal systems']{.underline} (Hanson and Buechler, 2015: 6).

Crucially for feminist glaciology, feminist political ecology argues for
[[the integration of alternative ways of knowing]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**[beyond]{.underline}** **[diverse]{.underline}**]{.mark} women's
[**[knowledges]{.underline}** [to include]{.underline}]{.mark} -- more
broadly -- the **[[unsettling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Eurocentric
**[[knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
**[[questioning]{.underline}]{.mark}** of dominant
**[[assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[diversification]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [modes and
[methods]{.mark} of knowledge production]{.underline} through the
incorporation of everyday lived experiences, storytelling, narrative,
and visual methods (Harris, 2015). This inclusion of alternative
knowledges and narratives alongside analysis of colonialism and
inequality, such as race relations (Mollett and Faria, 2013), fits
squarely into more recent feminist political ecologies that increasingly
go 'beyond gender'. [This [means]{.mark} that the [research builds
on]{.mark}]{.underline} 'a history of [**[boundary-breaking
ideas]{.underline}** \[[that]{.underline}\] [makes
possible]{.underline}]{.mark} the present-day [[spaces
where]{.underline}]{.mark} feminist **[[geographers
explore]{.underline}]{.mark}** power, **[[justice]{.mark}, [and
knowledge production]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ideas that encompass but
also surpass a focus on gender' (Coddington, 2015: 215).

Feminist glaciology raises critical conceptual, analytical, and
epistemological questions that are largely absent in the 21st-century
love affair with glaciers and ice. [[The framework]{.underline}]{.mark}
offered here strives to **[[open discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to
**[[introduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** avenues of
**[[investigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
**[[suggest ways forward]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only for scientific
enquiry that includes the environmental humanities and social sciences,
but also for public perceptions of glaciers. Examples within this review
and synthesis article are primarily meant to expose the value and
various dimensions of the feminist glaciology framework; [they are not
meant to be comprehensive, but rather starting points to indicate lines
of future investigation into this major gap in glacier studies and its
related contribution to global environmental change research and both
human and physical geography.]{.underline}

[[Considering]{.underline}]{.mark} Wittgenstein's notion of
**[[language]{.underline}]{.mark}**-games in a geographical context,
[the [Arctic]{.mark} region [provides]{.mark} an [interesting
case]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unlike many other geographical terms and
concepts -- such as space, place, region, and so on -- **[the Arctic
suggests a name]{.underline}**. However, as soon becomes clear, no more
than the nouns, verbs, etc. that Wittgenstein the elder argues against
the younger do not have essences, do not delimit logic and reality,
neither is the Arctic univocal (Spence, 2017). Rather, [[as Arctic
interest increases]{.underline}, **[it is
becoming]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[ever more [clear]{.mark} that [there
is no singular meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [no singular, locatable
place.]{.underline} [[What we are seeing]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
**[[is]{.mark} the continual "[spatialisation]{.mark}" of the
Arctic,]{.underline}** the ongoing making of a region
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[diverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** set
of **[[practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Knecht and Keil, 2013). These
processes of, inter alia, Arctic territorialisation, regionalisation,
and statisation have attracted attention from not only media and
politicians, but also geographers (Steinberg et al., 2015). [A
burgeoning field of [critical polar geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline},
for example, has **[[highlighted]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[complex
relationships]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}
**[actors]{.underline}**]{.mark}, environments, resources,
[[and]{.underline} **[politics]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in what many
consider the poster-region of climate change]{.underline} (e.g. Dodds
and Nuttall, 2015; Keil and Knecht, 2017a; Powell and Dodds, 2014).
Others have considered its cultural, historical, and economic
geographies, to mention but a few topics of recent interest (e.g. Arbo
et al., 2013; Cameron, 2015; Jensen, 2016; Lewis-Jones, 2017; Nuttall
and Callaghan, 2000; Shadian, 2012). [However, in contrast to Arctic
discourses and narratives, to date the specific language and
[language-practices of]{.mark} its denomination and [linguistic
spatialisation have not received]{.mark} extensive and in-depth academic
[analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, in spite of a rich body of work
on Arctic space-making practices, the [actual
language-practices]{.underline} -- **[[borders drawn by words and
metaphors]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [[are often noted in
passing]{.underline}, **[but rarely discussed]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
an extended manner. Indeed, [[the elasticity]{.mark} and multiplicity of
the region's own definitions [have]{.mark} arguably [become]{.mark} a
[taken-for-granted caveat]{.mark} of Arctic discourse -- in turn,
[risking]{.mark} the inadvertent [obfuscation]{.mark} of the
language-practices that produce this effect, as well as their
socio-political outcomes.]{.underline}

As part of ongoing Arctic "spatialisations" through cartography,
science, and politics, state actors have actively sought to assert
themselves as the key players in the Arctic field also through language
and practice (see Wilson Rowe, 2018b). These are in particular the eight
member states of Arctic Council: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark/
Greenland, Iceland, Canada, the US, and Russia. Nevertheless, the region
is also idiosyncratic in the inclusion of a wide spectrum of nonstate
actors in governance arrangements, most notably Indigenous peoples'
organisations partaking in the Arctic Council (Medby, 2019), as well as
the welcome of numerous "observers" from near and far (Knecht, 2017). It
is this broad, albeit hierarchical, inclusiveness that has led scholars
to describe Arctic political practices in terms of a "mosaic" (Young,
2005), a "bazaar" (Depledge and Dodds, 2017), and indeed global (e.g.
Bennett, 2014; Keil and Knecht, 2017b). [All of this hints at the
difficulty of demarcating what an Arctic "field" might be -- who are the
"players", and what are the "rules"? Drawing such a border is not the
aim here, however]{.underline}. On the contrary, [what is of particular
interest is how different language-games are played between diverse
stakeholders -- same words used, but with different meanings depending
on context, relation, and users]{.underline}. Again noting the
importance of the "game's" inherent playfulness and improvisational
"rules", this allows for a more nuanced conceptualisation of agency in
Arctic relations: [[There is no singular "**speaker**" or "**listener**"
in **Arctic discourse**]{.mark}; [there is neither a **monologue** nor
**dialogue**, but rather **conversation**(s)]{.mark} -- even if at times
dominated by certain voices, as will be returned to later in the
paper.]{.underline}

In the context of games, the Arctic is also a particularly fitting case
due to its frequent association with populist ideas of e.g. a "race",
"rush", and "scramble" to the Poles, even a "new Cold War" (Baev, 2007;
Craciun, 2009; Howard, 2009; Sale and Potapov, 2009). These seem
persistent imaginaries, despite great effort spent by experts and
academics in recent years to debunk sensationalist headlines (see Dodds
and Nuttall, 2015; Graczyk et al., 2017; Steinberg et al., 2014; Wilson
Rowe, 2013; Woon, 2014). Most recently, National Geographic published an
Arctic-themed issue with a cover that read "The New Cold War: As the ice
melts, old rivals scramble for position" (National Geographic Magazine:
The Arctic is Heating Up, 2019). Perhaps connected to historical
competitions between imperial powers, masculinity and bravery (Bloom,
1993; Drivenes, 2004; Lewis-Jones, 2017) -- brought to the present in
the shape of e.g. Olympic Games' torches reaching the North Pole
(Bennett, 2016) -- the Arctic does seem particularly prone to the
aforementioned game-metaphors. Such **[[metaphors are]{.mark} anything
but inconsequential]{.underline}**; [they are part of the above
"[spatialisation]{.mark}", of [constructing]{.mark} the [Arctic
as]{.mark} a certain kind of [space]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wilson Rowe,
2018a, 2018b). And, adding to this, non-linguistic signs frequently
feature too -- e.g. dice to illustrate Arctic meetings, and Arctic
inuksuit to illustrate (the Vancouver Olympic) games -- only bolstering
these associations (Wood-Donnelly, 2018). As such, [the Arctic is by
many imagined as a geopolitical playing-field in itself, where political
"moves" are made according to the "rules", e.g. of diplomacy and
international law]{.underline} (the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS)). However, what is interesting about such metaphors is not only
any mental picture produced, but how said picture -- [[the
"understanding]{.mark}" of the metaphor -- **[is]{.mark} also [premised
on]{.mark} knowing a social practice**, the **practical experience of
[playing a game]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[By here focusing on what seems to provide a demarcatable, geographical
space, it is brought into all the sharper relief that
**language**]{.underline} -- be it names, terms, tropes, or metaphors --
**[is anything but static,]{.underline}** anything but singular-essence.
While this is not a new insight per se, Wittgenstein's thought provides
a pertinent way of conceptualising (and indeed, articulating) the ways
in which [the languages of Arctic relations function and what they do
socially and politically.]{.underline} [**[The Arctic]{.underline}**,
like]{.mark} all the words in its "family" -- North, High North, etc. --
[[may]{.mark} then [be conceptualised not as]{.mark} the [field]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} in itself a "[move]{.mark}", [relying on]{.mark} the
"**[rules]{.mark} of the game**" to be **meaningful**]{.underline}. Or
rephrased, it is the active employment of the word -- how, when, where,
and by whom -- that gives it meaning and gives it life. [As will be
returned to in the paper's conclusion, it is these insights and
particular aspects brought to attention by Wittgenstein's work that
makes it so relevant to geographical scholarship.]{.underline}

In what follows, **[Arctic language-games]{.underline}** -- Arctic
meanings-in-use -- are explored through statements by Arctic state
personnel. [Focusing specifically on one of the eight Arctic states,
Norway, the empirical focus was chosen due to the state's employment of
identity discourse relation to the region: that is, an explicit
positioning as an **Arctic nation** in the face of international
interest and involvement at the time]{.underline}. While recent decades
have seen a surge in media interest in the region -- no doubt connected
to broader NATO-Russian relations -- the case also offers a useful
example in not being exceptional as such. [That is, another case study
could equally have been used to demonstrate the geographical
applicability and usefulness of Wittgenstein's philosophy -- as is
indeed the argument of the paper]{.underline}. Nevertheless, through its
Arctic and specifically Norwegian focus, the paper also adds a
linguistic aspect to the above mentioned critical polar geopolitics
scholarship, albeit acknowledging that there is much more that can and
should be said about other states and actors -- i.e. "players" -- in the
field.

The paper draws on 16 interviews conducted with state personnel in
2014--15, speeches, and formal policy publications relating to the
state's Arctic relations (N.Gov't, 2017; N.MFA., 2006, 2011; N.MTIF,
2015). Hence, these are what some would call "elite" use, and not a
review of national vernacular per se (nor an exploration of language-use
by e.g. non-Arctic or non-state actors). Moreover, interviews were
conducted in Norwegian, and all translations, and hence errors, are the
author's own. The interviews were conducted under the strict promise of
confidentiality, which means that no potentially identifying details are
provided about each respondent below.3 The semi-structured interviews
asked state personnel to reflect on their notions of Arctic statehood
and sense of Arctic identity (see Medby, 2017). And, as will be
elaborated below, these articulations of identity frequently happened
through stories of involvement, engagement, and even embodied
experiences (Medby, 2018a).

Worth noting however, interviews constitute a particular type of social
interaction, possibly conceptualised as a language-game themselves in
their semi-structured interplay, and so the data must also be
interpreted as such. As laid out in the discussion of Wittgenstein's
thought, language-use is relational, which means that those involved are
all "players", including here the interviewer. In other words, the
language used below -- words, similes, or choice of content -- are all
influenced by the author's presence too. Much more could be said about
positionality and situatedness of research, but in the context of the
present paper what it highlights is the contextuality of language too.
That is, recognising the "audience" becomes crucial to discussion, even
if language's reception can never be fully anticipated or known by the
speaker. In the same manner as the case is not the only that could have
been chosen, so too could other methods have provided equally valuable,
albeit different, insights. Thus, the below is written in the hope that
it opens up for further work to take up issues and concepts further.

The discussion below is ordered in four sections on (1) the Arctic
language-game, (2) related grammars e.g. of the (High) North, (3)
understanding and knowing through embodied experiences, and (4)
language-use as social and interactional. In short, the below
demonstrates how representing, imagining, and understanding the Arctic
cannot be divorced from the practical and the material too: the Arctic
languagegame is not only played in a moment of political speech, but
also in boardrooms, books, films, imaginations, and indeed the snow.

5\. Articulating the Arctic

5.1. Arctic

To begin with, the "Arctic" -- name, noun, adjective -- is, somewhat
ironically, of distant etymological origin, which was also something
interviewees frequently reflected on. From Greek \[arktos\], the
"Arctic" refers to "of the bear" -- not the polar bear, but the
constellation Ursa Major, which was used for maritime navigation in the
circumpolar north ('Arktisk', 2005). Of course, here one may consider
how "bear" too takes on a wholly different meaning than its furry
namesake -- a star, a position, a region -- based on navigational
practice. In short, in the language-game of historical seafarers, the
bear means something different -- but related -- to e.g. its zoological
counterpart, the stuffed toy on child's bed, the Russian Federation, and
so on, all within their specific games: they are a family of resembling
cases (see Wittgenstein, 2009 §67). Back to "the Arctic", what this
shows is how names can be traced back to practices. Today too, the name
takes its meaning from how it is employed, and as one interviewee
acknowledged, it is "a question of definition that is politically very
important". This is also what the article's opening quote by
Wittgenstein refers to: a name means nothing outside its context and
use. "[The Arctic" is meaningless until the region is engaged with as
such. Perhaps most often, it is invoked in international discourse, in
high-level geopolitical practice]{.underline}, and -- like the Greek
voyagers -- with and by those hailing far from the region itself. [These
different meanings may be considered as belonging to different
language-games, where the term refers to, inter alia, a specific region,
climate, geopolitical issue, or imaginary. Again, these are all related,
all share many commonalities, but point to different conversations and
activities taking place: multivalence as a matter of
multi-use.]{.underline}

[[If "the Arctic" means different things]{.mark} to different people
this is not a result of personal opinion: [they are playing
different]{.mark} language-[games]{.mark}, **[acting within different
forms of life]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Wittgenstein, 2009 §24).
[These games include those of biologists, climatologists, cartographers,
and of course, politicians]{.underline}. When Norwegian state personnel
were asked about the meaning of Arctic statehood, several started with
the political definition -- namely, the latitude of the Arctic Circle,
66 °33' degrees north. However, as shown in Fig. 1, even the Arctic
Council's thematic working groups (such as AMAP and CAFF, below) employ
different definitions depending on their focus: examples include the 10
°C July isotherm, the treeline, or socio-political populations4
(Grønnestad, 2016). This resonates with Wittgenstein's (2009 §26)
explanation that "naming is something like attaching a name tag to a
thing. One can call this preparation for the use of a word. But what is
it a preparation for?". Wittgenstein continues to consider the naming as
an act of communication, but points out the equal value of e.g. "here"
and "there" as spatial signifiers. What we are left with is the
importance of making sense in context, among peers. How the Arctic is
precisely bordered and bounded is only secondary to the social
recognition of this boundedness. The "preparation" is for the work to be
done within working groups, the Council, and other fora -- including
cartographic work that in turn produces Arctic spatialities
(Strandsbjerg, 2012).

### 2AC\-\--Militarism DA

#### Militarization DA\-\--geographical research [without]{.underline} specific commitments to anti-colonial work reproduces [cooption]{.underline} and [militarization]{.underline} while [preventing]{.underline} the formation of ethical knowledge. You should choose to [politicize]{.underline} the form of argumentation instead of [recuperating]{.underline} the aff back into TVA/SSD. 

**Koopman 16**, PhD from UBC, geography at Kent State. (Sara, 2016,
"Beware: Your Research May Be Weaponized," Annals of the American
Association of Geographers, Vol. 106, No. 3, pp. 530-535, JSTOR,)

[[To say that if you have]{.underline}]{.mark} any
[[doubt]{.underline}]{.mark} simply **[[do not
publish]{.underline}]{.mark}** it [[is too easy]{.underline}]{.mark} a
way out. [[That attitude would]{.underline}]{.mark} quickly [**[steer us
all away]{.underline}** [from doing research]{.underline}]{.mark} [with
peace]{.underline} and justice [groups]{.underline}, particularly in
conflict zones, but also in the United States and Canada, where these
groups are also increasingly under high police surveillance and even
infiltration. [[We need to have more]{.underline}
**[complicated]{.underline}**]{.mark} and sophisticated
[**[conversations]{.underline}** [about how to
manage]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[potential
[weaponization]{.mark}]{.underline}** of research, [[rather than]{.mark}
simply]{.underline} **[[avoiding]{.underline}]{.mark}** that sort of
**[[work]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Although I took three graduate methods seminars, including one on
feminist methods and one on decolonizing methodology taught by Linda
Tuhiwai Smith, in which we talked at length about what it meant to do no
harm, including research being used for unintended purposes, the issue
of [how]{.underline} our [research might be weaponized by armed actors
was never discussed]{.underline}. It seems that my experience is common
and that these conversations are rare in methods classes. Having
recently prepared my own first methods classes, I have been going
through the geography methods literature and textbooks (Hoggart, Lees,
and Davies 2002; Moss 2002; Hay 2005; Kindon, Pain, and Kesby 2007;
Clifford, French, and Valentine 2010; DeLyser et al. 2010; Gomez and
Jones 2010) and found surprisingly little on misuse of research more
generally and nothing about armed actors in particular. [I say armed
actors to include not only the military and police but other security
agencies, as well as rebel groups]{.underline}. [Especially after
the]{.underline} **[National Security Agency revelations]{.underline}**,
[it would be helpful to rethink together how to do research safely and
ethically in a time of high surveillance in general and high military
interest]{.underline} in the work of geographers in particular.1 We
could also offer each other more tools for how to look for and track the
use of our research by the military and share more stories of what we
have found. [As a discipline we can keep closer tabs on how the military
is both using and misusing geography.]{.underline}

The accompaniers I work with have reason to be cautious. In 2008, while
I was in Colombia, one of the organizations I collaborate with, the
Fellowship of Reconciliation (now FOR Peace Presence), confirmed that
[their e-mail account was hacked by the DAS]{.underline} (Departamento
Administrativo de Seguridad, state intelligence) because the Colombian
government used some of those e-mails in a court case. Although I was
always cautious, 1 [immediately worried again about having said
something in an e-mail to them that could have let the DAS know where
and when to find the threatened Colombian peace activists that FOR
accompanies]{.underline}. [The DAS was so enmeshed with]{.underline} the
**[paramilitaries]{.underline}** in Colombia that [it was eventually
closed down]{.underline} in 201 1 [after]{.underline} a series of
**[scandals]{.underline}**. Most of the surveillance equipment the DAS
used was provided by [the United States]{.underline}, which
[sent]{.underline} more than **[\$6 billion in military
aid]{.underline}** between 2000 and 2010 to Colombia, far more than any
other country in the Americas ever, making the United States a powerful
player there.2

[Accompaniers from the United States use this power, and the way it
makes their lives count more in Colombia, to \"make space\" (as they
themselves put it) for the threatened Colombian peace activists that
they walk with]{.underline}. Accompaniers\' bodies on the ground are a
signal to the military and paramilitary forces that threaten the
Colombian human rights workers, but their bodies alone are not enough.
When FOR got this proof that the Colombian army was monitoring their
e-mail, they sent an action alert to their supporter list and generated
some 800 pressure e-mails, which they used to get a high-level meeting
with the U.S. State Department. [They made specific requests for certain
messages to be sent to particular agencies of the Colombian government
and from them to local officials in the region where FOR works. This is
how accompaniment works, through leveraging these chains of connections
to people and places with power]{.underline} (Koopman 2014).

[My writing about the work of accompaniers could serve as another link
in these chains]{.underline}. One of O\'Lear\'s students could very well
end up being a military adviser in Colombia or teaching Colombian
military at the U.S. Army\'s School of the Americas (SOA; now formally
the Western Hemispheric Institute for Security and Cooperation, the most
elite of many such training institutes), [where they are the largest
group of students]{.underline}. Perhaps having read my article they
would have and teach more respect for Colombian peace communities or the
international peace activists who accompany them. 1do not doubt that
O\'Lear had this intention in teaching it to them. [Forgive
me]{.underline}, though, [if I am dubious and think that it is important
to think through how it might instead somehow be used against
them]{.underline}. In my own case I think my article is safe for
military use, but [I did black out portions of my
dissertation]{.underline}.

I am not saying that the military should never read our work but rather
that caution about what they might be able to do with it is warranted.
Neither the United States nor the Colombian military has a good track
record with peace workers. The Colombian DAS not only invasively tracked
human rights activists, to the extent of following and photographing
their children and sending death threats (using those photos), but also
tried to cause their political death through delegitimizing them in the
media and criminalizing them with false charges. These tactics might
well have come from U.S. training, as threatening the children of
activists was a method in the training manuals used at the SOA.3

The SOA winds through this story. [Peace and justice activists in Latin
America are more likely to be wary of working with geographers in
particular and know that there is heightened military involvement in our
discipline]{.underline}, [because Demarest]{.underline}, [the closest
military adviser to the Bowman Expeditions and one of the original
designers of the project]{.underline}, [is an SOA graduate]{.underline}
(Wainwright 2012b). The online documentary about the expedition in
Oaxaca was made by an SOA Watch activist, Simón Sedillo, and widely
distributed through antimilitarist movements.4 [[The **Bowman
Expeditions\'** gathering of **information** for **military use**, along
with its **failure** to gain truly **informed consent**,]{.mark}
including **knowledge** of the **military\'s role** and **failure** to
return **all data when requested**, according to the research subjects,
[have been well covered]{.mark} in **alternative** media in **Latin
America**- so if you do fieldwork there you will be more likely to be
seen as from a discipline with ties to the U.S. military and more likely
to be suspected of hiding those.]{.underline}

[My argument here is not specific to Latin America]{.underline},
however. If you collaborate with or do research on or related to peace
and justice organizing anywhere, [[it is now more important]{.mark} than
ever [to have]{.mark} a [heightened awareness]{.mark} of the likelihood
that [the]{.mark} military (or [police]{.mark}) [will]{.mark} not only
[be reading your]{.mark} published [work]{.mark} but could be tapping
your e-mails, phone calls, and even live conversations]{.underline}.
Yes, my paranoia has increased from working with Colombian human rights
movements, but recent leaks of files from the company the Hacking Team
confirm that their software is widely used around the world to listen to
ambient conversations held in a room with a cell phone, even when it is
off. [[We could all **benefit** from more **conversations**
about]{.mark} what **[ethical research practices]{.mark}** are in this
context and particularly [how it shapes]{.mark} **ethical
[collaboration]{.mark} with peace and justice groups**.]{.underline}

Geography for War

The AAG council discussed but never directly voted on the Oaxaca
scandal. A later vote to establish a committee to investigate relations
between geography and the military failed. Together these could be read
as acceptance of military use of and involvement in geography more
broadly. [This can cut us off from those working for peace]{.underline}.
Even though 1 have longstanding and deep ties throughout the movement I
work with, the scandal has made those who do not know me more
distrustful of me. [Perhaps they are right to be wary, for heightened
military interest in geography makes it more likely that our work could
be weaponized, even when that is not our intent.]{.underline}

[Because the field of anthropology has clearly stated that Human Terrain
Systems is \"an unacceptable application of anthropological
expertise,\"]{.underline}5 **[[military attempts to
know]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and control) [the so-called **[human
terrain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[have]{.mark} explicitly [**shifted** to
**geography**]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 Because even the term human terrain
has been so heavily critiqued by anthropologists, [the military has now
widely replaced it with the term **human geography**]{.underline}, [and
their materials now increasingly point to the importance of human
geography for waging war]{.underline}.

[[Medina]{.underline}]{.mark} (2016) [[made this]{.mark} all quite
[explicit in]{.mark} his astounding [article]{.mark}, actually
[entitled]{.mark}]{.underline} \"**[[From Anthropology to Human
Geography]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" He bluntly said that the shift has
been strengthened because the \"backlash\" among geographers in response
to the Bowman Expeditions has been much less than anthropology\'s
response to the enrollment of their discipline by the military. He
believes that geography is more welcoming to the military than
anthropology because we are less empathetic to and more distant from our
research subjects!

There are real costs to the silence of the AAG Executive Council, which
voted against even forming a broader commission to look at the
relationship between geographers and the military, and to the limited
response by all of us to the growing militarization and weaponization of
geography. [The [military\'s]{.mark} recent turn to [geography]{.mark},
and the **culture in geography of welcoming them**, makes it that much
more likely that they [will]{.mark} **read** and potentially
[**weaponize** your **work**]{.mark}. Your work might be added to the
**military\'s huge database** without you **ever knowing it**, as it is
unlikely to come up in Google Scholar]{.underline} (Wainwright 2012a).
[Morin, for example, had her chapter on landscape cited in an
operational guide for the Marines on how to read the cultural landscape
so as to better control a population quickly as soon as they arrive in
an area]{.underline}.7

Increasing military use of and involvement in our discipline threatens
our ability to do our work because it makes us more suspect,8 but it
also, more disturbingly, makes it more likely that our work could be
used to harm and even kill people. In my case, likely military scrutiny
means that accompaniers do not consider it safe to share much of the
internal movement debate about different ways to do accompaniment
because some groups worry that their work might then be jeopardized,
putting the lives of the threatened Colombian peace activists that they
accompany at risk. [This is a loss to peace work because having this
discussion publicly could affect the way this growing peace
tactic]{.underline} (new teams opened last year in Kenya and Burma) is
done around the world and its effectiveness. [Yet these concerns are
real, and I am cautious about what I share publicly.]{.underline}

We are the U.S. military\'s new favorite discipline. [They not only want
to read us]{.underline} (even on Twitter, where I have a fair number of
military followers despite, or perhaps because, of my handle,
\@spaceforpeace)- [but they want to **fund us**]{.underline}. [Not only
is there a fast-growing trend of **accepting military funding** for
**geography research**, often through front **organizations** like
**Minerva**]{.underline} (Wainwright 2013), [but there is a growing
trend of accepting **military funding** for **geography
teaching**]{.underline}. [Yours might be one of the many universities
approached]{.underline} by the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation
to take money to teach geointelligence certification courses.9 These
certificates are a direct pipeline to work in the huge new building of
the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The building houses more
than 10,000 of their 16,000 employees and is the largest built by the
Army Corp of Engineers since the Pentagon (Crampton, Roberts, and
Poorthuis 2014). As Crampton et al. pointed out, huge numbers of drones
create massive amounts of data that require many workers to process. [As
military funding for and use of geography becomes more common, **[it
seems all the more important]{.mark}** for those of us who are **not
accepting this funding** [to be **increasingly cautious** about]{.mark}
how [our **work**]{.mark} **might be used by the
military**.]{.underline}

Geography for Peace

[Geographers rarely focus on peace]{.underline}. It is not one of the
key concepts in geography (Clifford et al. 2008), nor even a key concept
in political geography (Gallaher et al. 2008), nor is it defined in the
Dictionary of Human Geography (Gregory et al. 2009) or in the massive
International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Kitchin and Thrift 2009),
the Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Warf 2006), or the Sage Handbook of
Geographical Knowledge (Agnew and Livingstone 2011)- although, perhaps
because of my repeatedly making this point, I was recently asked to
write such an entry for the new AAG encyclopedia.

To be fair, not all that much work has been done by geographers directly
using the word peace - although a great deal of critical geography is
both about and for peace, understood more broadly- the right to the
city, food sovereignty, responding to the climate crisis\-- which are
all parts of a positive peace, or peace with justice. [We rarely link
these different issues and struggles this way, though. Perhaps, as Ross
(2011) argued, this is because the word peace is widely perverted by war
makers and can mean the peace of oppression. The Bowman Expeditions
themselves claim to be promoting peace.]{.underline}

I suspect, though, that [[the issue has more to do with peace being
understood as simply not war]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It seems
that]{.underline} **[many geographers]{.underline}** who want peace have
[focused]{.underline} their [efforts on critiquing]{.underline} forms of
warfare, **[violence]{.underline}**, and inequality, [which we do have a
strong tradition of]{.underline}. Even recent geography collections and
the Annals special issue on war and peace have focused much more on war,
as if taking it apart were enough to achieve peace.10 Of course,
understanding the workings of war is important, but ending war does not
automatically lead to peace.

[Especially in these times of what Gregory (2011) called the
\"everywhere war,\" it is all the more important to think about and
contribute to the various ways in which peace and justice are built, and
can be built, even in the midst of conflict. [**Peace is spatial** and
**varies** widely across **time**, **space**, and **scale**]{.mark}- as
do the ways it can be **made**]{.underline}. [[Peace is]{.mark} not a
**static endpoint** but a **[constant process]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[As geographers, [we are]{.mark} particularly well [placed to
draw]{.mark} connections]{.underline}, what Katz (2001) called
**[[countertopographical lines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [between the
different ways not only capitalist violences takes shape but also
between the pieces of peace that are being built around the
world]{.underline} (Koopman 2011b). [Using the term peace with justice
broadly can be a way to foster alliances and strengthen that
work.]{.underline}

The profile of peace in geography is small but growing. In her recent
review of this literature, Loyd (2012) highlighted the contributions of
feminist geographers to this work. She also pointed to antiracist
feminist antiviolence activism as offering an analytic that serves well
to connect issues and movements and to the importance of drawing
connections across peace at home, peace on the streets, and peace
abroadparticularly in the face of international wars promoted to uphold
a purported domestic peace. [I agree and support her call for deepening
the conversation between that literature and work on peace and
justice]{.underline}. **[Critiquing war and violence]{.underline}** [is
**essential**]{.underline} [but not enough]{.underline}. [I echo Tyner
and Inwood\'s (2011) and Shepparďs (2013) final AAG presidential column
calls for geography to be not only antiwar but actually
pro-peace.]{.underline}

#### Colonial Erasure DA\-\--their interpretation places [anti-colonial content]{.underline} as less important than [topical form]{.underline} which operates in service of domination through marginalization and Erasure. 

**Stuhl 16**, Associate professor of environmental studies and sciences
at Bucknell University. (Andrew, *Unfreezing the Arctic: Science,
Colonialism, and the Transformation of Inuit Lands*, Introduction: "Is
the Arctic Out of Time, pg. 2-3, published 2016, RC)

As the auditorium emptied, and conference-goers began to queue by the
trays of cherry danishes, I introduced myself to the person in the aisle
behind me. The requisite exchange of hellos and credentials ensued. But
something in my introduction caught my new colleague off guard. "A
historian?" he remarked, kinking his head. "What are you doing here?"
[[In]{.mark} terms of [academic standing]{.mark}, [Arctic climate change
is the domain of]{.mark} the natural and social
[sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is not immediately obvious, to at
least some of these scholars, what history offers to the study of
environmental problems.]{.underline} The study of the past may seem like
a hobby, a luxury in a bygone age of planetary stability. And, to be
fair, many historians choose not to intervene in contemporary debates,
even if their scholarship bears directly on present conditions.22 For
those Arctic scholars in disciplines outside of history, this book
provides a backstory for climate change and globalization. [The Arctic
has been central to the development of scientific knowledge since the
middle of the 1800s,]{.underline} just as scientists have been central
to developments in the Arctic over the same period. [And, [while melting
ice is out of the ordinary, it is also nothing new]{.mark}: it is the
latest in a string of rapid environmental transformations in the region
over the last 150 years]{.underline}. [When we take seriously these
aspects of the Arctic's past, rising temperatures and shifting global
power dynamics become more than ecological or social problems. They
become matters of history as well.]{.underline}23 Quite literally,
[previous episodes of scientific exploration and exploitation permeate
northern societies and landscapes.]{.underline} [[Current frameworks of
governance and knowledge-making in the Arctic are also products of the
colonial experience]{.mark}, [established through]{.mark} acts of
[Congress and modern treaties]{.mark}.]{.underline} [If, in promoting
ambitious plans for adaptation in the Arctic, this history is concealed,
social and natural scientists may repeat it without realizing
it.]{.underline} Geographer Emilie Cameron has convincingly shown that
[[such politics]{.mark} are at [play in climate science
today]{.mark},]{.underline} [specifically in the literature on
vulnerability and adaptation.]{.underline} [Scientists in these fields
often frame Inuit ecological knowledge and existing natural resource
management regimes as inapplicable to physical conditions spawned by
climate change]{.underline}. [As a result, Inuit lose standing in
channels of Arctic decision making.]{.underline} [[Natural scientists
and social scientists can prevent this situation by examining
circumpolar phenomena in the context of a history of colonialism
there]{.mark}, and remaining committed to the principles of modern
treaties and participatory democracy]{.underline}---like fair
representation, informed consent, and self-determination.24 For my
colleagues in history---and especially environmental history and the
history of science---[I intend these pages as a call to
arms]{.underline}. We should engage more fully in current affairs, as
public intellectuals with valuable and relevant expertise. As historians
Mark Carey and Nancy Langston have argued for the issue of climate
change, historians have an ability---and duty---to reframe environmental
crisis in human terms. [[Circumpolar indigenous peoples have taken the
lead on this]{.mark}, reminding world power brokers that climate change
is not a problem of atmospheric chemistry---[it is a human rights
issue]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} historians with
interests in Arctic and polar regions [[must]{.mark} complement this
narrative by [help]{.mark}ing our [colleagues in]{.mark} the natural and
social [sciences]{.mark} [confront]{.mark} the [colonial
legacies]{.mark} of their disciplines. [We must]{.mark} also
[challenge]{.mark} the [pervasive misconceptions about]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} held in the [communities]{.mark} we call home,
misconceptions that, despite their deconstruction in the scholarly
literature, continue to produce troubling political and material effects
in the north. [This]{.mark} kind of [publicly engaged history]{.mark} is
not meant to discredit scientists, or reject science in meeting
environmental challenges.]{.underline} [Rather, it [reorients]{.mark}
our [discussions from]{.mark} the [sites where warming is most obvious
to the places and processes that drive climate change and
globalization]{.mark}.]{.underline} In these ways and for these reasons,
[historians should intervene in civil discourse]{.underline}.26 The
architecture of the narrative herein reflects this call to arms. Each
chapter presents a case study of an environmental transformation in the
western Arctic and its associated interventions. Taken together, they
constitute a history of northern colonialism from 1881 to 1984. The
chronology does not tally with standard narratives of the region, or
even the neat numbers of the Roman calendar, but with the intersecting
paths of North American politics, global economic history, Inuit
accounts of the past, and science's internal development (disciplinary
breakthroughs, for example). To foreground science as a prism onto all
of these processes, I organize the chapters according to ideas that
guided human interactions with nature at the time: dangerous,
threatened, wild, strategic, and disturbed. Readers may find some of
these terms anachronistic, unfairly confined to a period of years, or
similar to the ways scientists imagine other "last frontiers" in
Antarctica, Oceania, or the Amazon basin.27 I welcome these reactions as
part of continuing discussions of history and global change. The
individual cases I present do not so much replace one another as
entangle with each other, leaving today's landscape as the sum total of
the past. This analytical and organizational approach stays honest to
the historical records I have consulted, but it does something else
equally as important. It underlines the historian's roles as interpreter
and public scholar. That is, [historians turn to the past not to
discover what happened, but to make sense out of the world in which we
now live]{.underline}. As historian Howard Zinn observed, [humans
inflict pain on each other and the planet they share because they bury
social atrocities "in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are
buried in containers in the earth]{.underline}."28 The [[Arctic's
colonial legacies are being buried]{.mark}, unwittingly, [by a surge of
popular and scientific media]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unfreezing the Arctic
means that, as the circumpolar basin warms, [[we must dissolve notions
of the place as frozen in time]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It means
confronting the long colonial life of an environment]{.mark} imagined as
unspoiled, remote, or simply local---[so]{.mark} that [we can
reach]{.mark} a more [sophisticated understanding of climate
change]{.mark} and globalization. [It means releasing history
from]{.mark} the [past]{.mark}, [showing]{.mark} how [it matters]{.mark}
now [for all those contemplating]{.mark} the
[future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

feeling]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[how judges]{.mark} are able to [sleep at
night]{.mark} [and how the powerful]{.mark} [are]{.mark} able to pretend
that the normal running of things is in any way 'fair'.]{.underline}
[When the 2011 Eton entrance exam asks 13- year-old boys to hypothesise
being Prime Minister and to defend the shooting dead of protesters, we
catch a glimpse of **this [taught moral
flexibility]{.mark}**:]{.underline}

> The year is 2040. There have been riots in the streets of London after

But [[unfortunately]{.mark} for everyone else]{.underline},
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of [**[imaginative
exercise]{.underline}** [doesn't remain
hypothetical]{.underline}]{.mark} [for very long]{.underline}. [[These
people move from]{.underline} **[volatile
scenario]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on page [to violent action]{.mark} in
real life]{.underline}** [without ever encountering people who might
have reason to protest, protected as they are by gated communities,
boarding schools, poorly-treated nannies, private education, money to
burn, member's clubs and, above all, money, assets and private
property]{.underline}. **[[Being trained to argue
anything]{.underline}]{.mark}** [so long [as it preserves the **existing
order**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is the definition of law]{.mark} as
practiced by the state]{.underline}. The moral flexibility that private
schools and **[[debating societies teach]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [[the
rhetorical lubricant that ensures]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the]{.underline} **[ruling class will always
win]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[No one]{.mark} else [will ever win]{.mark}
'the debate' [because the]{.mark} entire [purpose]{.mark} of debate [is
to prevent **anything truly disruptive**]{.mark} **from
happening**]{.underline}, all the while masking real violence from being
seen. While Britain brutally colonised half the globe, its posh young
men were learning to equivocate over glasses of sherry. Just as the
police are trained to regard members of the public as dangerous,
incomprehensible beings best handled at the end of a baton, so the
people who give them orders are trained to eliminate all normal human
feeling. The notorious hierarchy and cruelty of British boarding schools
is no coincidence: how else to treat the rest of the world as inferior
without having internalised a hard, intractable kernel of inhumanity
inside your soft young self? [Debate is merely one disciplining
technique among many, but it's a technique that runs all the way up from
school to court to parliament.]{.underline}

[[If anyone deviates from the '**rules'**,]{.mark} [that is]{.mark} to
say sees the **debate-form** for the sham it is, or takes to the
streets, [displacing the]{.mark} imposed '[platform']{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the construction of a **[new order]{.mark}**, [then]{.mark}
the true face of all those who defend '**debate'** is
**revealed**]{.underline}: suddenly [[those]{.mark} who are [most
powerful pretend]{.mark} that [they are under siege by]{.mark}
[those]{.mark} who are '[unreasonable']{.mark}]{.underline} -- we see
this lately at universities where those with bigoted views pretend that
they are forced to pull out because of the menace of protest, to cities
when politicians responding to the riots fall over themselves not to
understand why people might resent being killed and harassed by police
officers who never suffer any consequences.

[[Debate is a cover-story]{.mark}: never having to be honest about your
true intentions **while [pretending to be
open-minded]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Debate dissociates argument from
passion]{.underline}; phony talking-points from real life. There are
multiple things we do not agree about -- and [we also disagree with the
way in which you want us to say it]{.underline}. [The narrowness of the
debate-form allows those with power to dictate the boundaries of
'**reasonable' discussion** and **ignore**]{.underline} (or police)
**[everything]{.underline}** that happens **[outside]{.underline}** it.
But really, from Oxbridge to courts to government, we can easily see
**[it's not a debate, it's a war.]{.underline}**

(Bronen, 2010). [[There is]{.mark} often a [slippage

**[[planetary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [What gets lost]{.underline} in

[holds a **refusal** to fall victim to]{.mark} an **[alarmist]{.mark}**,

that has been historical and often wielded to discuss Indigenous peoples
and their inevitable disappearance conveniently from resource rich
areas. [[Care must be taken when reporting the disappearance of

[Taking up Kane\'s project, is there a way to identify the enactments of
colonialism without a spectacularised event of damage, loss and the
horror of that loss, as the vessel of discussion?]{.underline} And is it
possible to have that conversation without lioning Indigenous resilience
as a life-lesson for non-indigenous peoples elsewhere? As Eve Tuck and

4 \| CONCLUSION

In this paper, we argue that descriptors such as 'Atlantification' are
the latest in a line of tropes and descriptors being used to account and
audit an Arctic that is said to be undergoing fundamental 'declinist'
state-change. Judged to be no longer satisfactorily described as a
circumpolar region, rigidly defined by coldness north of the Arctic
Circle, the Arctic\'s physical and environmental qualities are now being
cultivated as a 'new Arctic'. Ice and cold are fundamental to the
everyday working and spiritual lives of northern communities
(Aporta, 2002; Cruickshank, 2005; Nuttall, 2019; Routledge, 2018; Stuhl,
2016; Watt-Cloutier, 2018; Whyte, 2017); what so often gets prioritised
is the impact of melting and thawing for states and communities
elsewhere. [[Ice]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular, [[is being
extracted]{.mark}, hoarded, redistributed [and storified]{.mark},
empowered by a looming sense that it is disappearing [and]{.mark}/or
[retreating in]{.mark} the face of further **energy
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[shipping]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[transport projects]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline} [investment by **Arctic** and non-Arctic
**states**]{.underline}]{.mark} [eager [to secure
**competitive**]{.mark} or **strategic [advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Gornitz, 2019; Zellen, 2009).

[Going forward, a task for ice humanities scholars is to be ever mindful
of becoming inhumanities in the sense of erasing/ dispossessing those
who inhabit worlds where there are co-relationalities with ice,
multi-species relationships, and multiple spatialities, seasonalities
and temporalities that do not pivot around Euro-American/global framings
of time and space, geopolitical worlding and extractive
capitalism]{.underline} (Dodds & Sörlin, 2002; Tsing, 2005).

#### Settler Marxism DA\-\--their investment in [class analysis]{.underline} reproduces colonial enactments.

[[Settler Marxism has three]{.mark} crucial
[faults]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
[failing to account for all the people who don't fit this proletarian
form]{.underline}, settler Marxism [doesn't address the largest possible
bloc of revolutionary actors]{.underline}.
**[[Where]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this model, for example,
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** the people who aren't employed and the
people who are **[[structurally unemployed?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Where
are **[[incarcerated]{.underline}]{.mark}** people**[[?]{.mark}
[Land-based communities?]{.mark}]{.underline}** The shelter-less? All
those whose cosmologies don't recognize the wage relation or the settler
state? Where are the women, non-men, and queer people? [The so-called
"bread-and-butter" dispensation of most unions, in which wages and
working conditions are the sole priorities, assumes that the
aforementioned humans and their needs don't count.]{.underline}

**[[Two]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the site of
struggle---[labor]{.mark}---[is misplaced]{.mark}]{.underline}, since
the violence of commodification exceeds the violence of wage labor. Wage
slavery is not chattel slavery, as Marx averred, but [[why]{.mark} do we
organize around [the wage relation rather]{.mark} than the **[chattel
relation]{.mark}**:]{.underline} that is, **[[the hierarchy of human
value?]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Denise Ferreira da Silva has precisely
and rigorously theorized, the "whole field of modern representation"
inaugurated by Enlightenment thought to rationalize European imperialism
is predicated on a universal Subject (akin to Sylvia Wynter's
"Breadwinner/Investor subject of the nation-state") who seeks
self-determination through the elimination of objects: the unhuman
others of racial capitalism and settler colonialism. In 2666, Bolaño
effectively investigates this relationship between canonical modern
thought and the mortality of its others by connecting, in circuitous
fashion, European philosophy and its contemporary scholars to the
murdered and missing women in former New Spain.

[[What would happen if we organized around this violence of life and
death]{.underline}]{.mark}---of self-determination and
extermination---[[rather than]{.mark} the [abstract]{.mark} violence of
the [wage]{.mark}]{.underline} (which, after all, is a copy of the
former)? [What if we put murdered and missing Indigenous women (and
their descendants) at the center of our collective efforts for
transformation?]{.underline} Wouldn't ending violence in all its forms
mean the end of the wage relation too?

The third problem with settler Marxism is that if we maintain the wage
relation as the horizon of change, [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[other vio]{.mark}lences]{.underline} of settler colonialism and racial
capitalism [[will remain]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is to say,
[[after]{.mark} the [settler-Marxist revolution]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[we may have common ownership]{.underline}]{.mark} of the means of
production (and thus an end to capitalism), but [[settlement, white
supremacy, and heteropatriarchy will still be present and accounted
for]{.underline}]{.mark}, as will institutionality and, arguably,
nationalism and imperialism. [[So]{.underline}]{.mark}, too,
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} be the psychic economy that Silva adduces,
and **[[the hierarchy of human value overall]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
None of these issues simply "disappear" in the settler Marxist future,
as anyone who's been in a room with self-identified leftists can attest.
[Or [look at the rise of the alt-left]{.mark}]{.underline} (exemplified
by Chapo Trap House and works like Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies and
Mark Lilla's The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics) [[and
its inability to account for]{.mark} (its) [whiteness]{.mark}, let alone
hierarchy altogether]{.underline}.

#### Infighting DA\-\--their [investment]{.underline} in Party politics reproduces [chauvinistic]{.underline} fights between [radicals]{.underline} that increase [personal militarization]{.underline} and lead to [activist burnout]{.underline}.

A major force that has contributed to [**rigid radicalism is rigid
ideology and** its **tendency to generate certainties** and **fixed
answers**]{.underline} [that close off the potential for
experimentation.]{.underline} [Alongside]{.underline} the [**[Marxist
critique]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of capitalist ideology]{.underline}
[was an aspiration to [**replace it with**]{.mark} a **[revolutionary
anti-capitalist ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It was thought that
revolution [[required]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[unified
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}** among proletarians: [they needed to
be taught that it was in their interests to overthrow
capitalism]{.underline}. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** revolutionary
**[[vanguard]{.underline}]{.mark}** was [tasked with
**[developing]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline}
**[disseminating]{.underline}** [this [ideology]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and with everything in life subordinated to the goal of revolution,
**everyone and [everything]{.mark}** []{.mark}could be **[treated
instrumentally]{.mark}**, as a **means** [to]{.mark} the
**[seizure]{.mark} of state [power]{.mark} and the end of
capitalism.**]{.underline}

The philosopher Nick [Thoburn [links this
revolutionary]{.mark}]{.underline} anti-capitalist [[ideology
to]{.underline}]{.mark} what he calls a "[militant
diagram]{.underline}": a [[persistent affective]{.mark} and ideological
[tendency]{.mark} that]{.underline} **[first emerged through Bolshevism
and Leninism.]{.underline}**3 It was later [expressed in movements
throughout]{.underline} the twentieth century, from [Third
World]{.underline} national liberation struggles [to socialist
formations in North America and Europe to Black Power]{.underline} in
the 1960s and '70s. According to Colectivo Situaciones, a militant
research group in Argentina, this figure of militancy is **[[always
"setting out the party line,"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

> [keeping]{.underline} for himself a [knowledge of what ought to
> happen]{.underline} in the situation, which he always approaches from
> outside, in an instrumental and transitive way (situations have value
> as moments of a general strategy that encompasses them),
> [because]{.underline} his [fidelity is,]{.underline} above all,
> **[ideological and preexists all situations]{.underline}**.4

[The notion of a correct party line took different forms]{.underline}
among different movements, but [the basic]{.underline} (hierarchical,
[rigid]{.underline}) [structure was the same]{.underline}: a **[certain
privileged group]{.underline}** [would help **usher** in the
**revolution**]{.underline} [through a correct **interpretation of
theory**]{.underline} [and the **unfolding of history**]{.underline}.
Despite joyful transformations and insurrectionary openings, [tendencies
towards **[vanguardism]{.mark}** and **rigid ideology** often **[led
groups towards isolation]{.mark}** and **stagnation**.]{.underline}

Among many other groups, these tendencies can be [seen in]{.underline}
the US-based **[[Weather Underground]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a militant
white anti-imperialist group]{.underline} active during the 1970s. They
are best-known for their series of [bombings]{.underline} targeting
public [infrastructure]{.underline} and monuments, conducted in an
attempt to wake up white Americans to realities of US imperialism such
as the government's slaughter of Vietnamese people and its assassination
of Black Panthers.

They also **[[adopted Maoist self-criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
order to [**ferret** out]{.mark} any **trace of the dominant
[ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} within their group. [**[Criticism
sessions]{.mark}**, which could **last for hours or** even **days**,
**involved** members **[discussing weaknesses]{.mark}**, tactical
**[mistakes]{.mark}**, emotional **investments**,
**[preparedness]{.mark} for violence**]{.underline}, and even sexual
proclivities in an effort [to **[shed]{.mark}**]{.underline} all
[**[attachments to]{.mark}** the dominant **[order]{.mark}** and
**induce a revolutionary way of being**]{.underline}.5 Even the most
ruthless criticism could be justified as part of this process, and the
Weather Underground developed a whole regimen of practices designed to
purify themselves of any trace of dominant ideology, coupled with
constant injunctions towards (what they saw as) the most militant forms
of action possible.

While their tactics were controversial, they were also widely supported
at the time, and the Weather Underground was only one of many groups
that were bombing and sabotaging corporate and government
infrastructure. What we are interested in getting at is not particular
tactics, nor something specific to underground groups, but the way that
certain tendencies of thought, action, and feeling can congeal into
stifling patterns. As former Weather Underground member Bernardine Dohrn
writes,

> [[Weather succumbed to **dogma**]{.mark}**, arrogance, and
> certainty**]{.underline}. We were not alone. There was recovery, and
> amends that are still underway. But the [perceived necessity to have
> answers to everything]{.underline} and to struggle endlessly
> **[resulted in ungenerous and [damaging
> leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[harm to]{.mark} great
> [comrades]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and **wretched behavior**]{.underline}.
> 6

As Bill Ayers, another former member, explains, the attempt to escape
completely from a culture of white supremacy and capitalist conformity
enforced an intense, alternative orthodoxy:

> **[It was [fanatical obedience]{.mark}]{.underline}**, we militant
> nonconformists suddenly [tripping over one another to be exactly
> alike,]{.underline} following the sticky roles of congealed idealism.
> I cannot reproduce the stifling atmosphere that overpowered us. Events
> came together with the gentleness of an impending train wreck, and
> there was the sad sensation of waiting for impact.7

Though the goal was to create revolutionary forms of organization
capable of overthrowing the US government, their ideological rigidity
and norms of relentless self-sacrifice paradoxically isolated them
further and further from the "masses" that they sought to mobilize.

When we interviewed him, Gustavo [Esteva discussed]{.underline} his own
**[experience of Marxist-Leninist militancy]{.underline}** [[in Latin
America]{.underline}]{.mark} during this time:

> In the '60s, when I became associated with a group in the process of
> [organizing a guerrilla group]{.underline} in Mexico, [whose members
> were assuming that they were **already [the
> vanguard]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the proletariat [because they
> had]{.underline} the [revolutionary program]{.underline}, I was fully
> immersed in what we now call sad militancy. Our "program" was
> evidently an intellectual construction in the Leninist tradition. We
> had already our criticism of Stalinism, et cetera, but
> [we]{.underline} still [were in the tradition of [trying to seize the
> power]{.mark} of the state]{.underline} **[[for a
> revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the top down, **[through social
> engineering]{.underline}**. [We were thus preparing
> ourselves]{.underline} (military training, etc.) [and
> organizing]{.underline}. Of course, there were moments or conditions
> of joy, laughter, intensified emotion, exhilaration.... [The
> environment of conspiracy]{.underline} and clandestinity and the
> shared ideology shaped real camaraderie and episodes full of joy, but
> [it was clear that the experience itself was pure sad militancy, full
> of **[creating boundaries]{.mark}**, **making distinctions**,
> **[comparing]{.mark}**, **[making plans]{.mark}**, and so
> on.]{.underline}
>
> ... How the whole experience ended makes the point better than any of
> those stories: [[one]{.mark} of our [leader]{.mark}s [killed the

> accumulating]{.mark} in ourselves [and wanted to impose on]{.mark} the
> whole [society]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the military training, for
> an army or a guerrilla, to learn how to use a weapon is pretty easy;
> what is difficult is to learn to kill someone in cold blood, someone
> like you, that did nothing personal against you.... Nothing sadder
> than that.8

[The experience of the Weather Underground and Esteva both make it clear
that these [ideological tendencies]{.mark} are not just about
ideas]{.underline}; **[they also [contain]{.mark} their own
[pleasures]{.mark} and highs]{.underline}**[,
**[induced]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in part [by]{.mark} the [sense of
being]{.mark} clandestine and [more aware than "the
masses]{.mark}]{.underline}**." [Ideology is not simply rigid and cold:
it can include a warm sense of **belonging and camaraderie among its
adherents**.]{.underline}
