### Link---China threat

#### US orientalist narratives in China threat discourse further entrench neocolonial 'benignity' and entrap colonized peoples into acting against their own interests

political geography: Island perspectives on neocolonialism and the China
threat discourse)

The USA is pivotal to localising and activating the China threat
discourse in all four narratives even though only Guåhan has been
straightforwardly colonised by the USA.

[The China threat discourse is linked to a bipolar worldview.
[Through]{.mark} the workings of [Western]{.mark} historical
[analogy]{.mark}, [China replaces past enemies, such as Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union, as the 'Other' against which the West defines and
understands itself]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kopper & Peragovics, 2019).
[[Western]{.mark} and metropolitan [states]{.mark} frequently [contrast
their own benignity with the China threat]{.mark}. As a result, despite
arguments that engagement with China threatens islanders\' ability to
act in their own interests (due to 'debt traps'), threatens island
ecosystems (due to environmental destruction), and threatens the
demographic dominance of islander populations (due to large-scale
immigration), such island-centred arguments rapidly recede in the face
of assertions of Western superiority.]{.underline}

[The [China threat discourse is]{.mark} not merely [a means of
distancing]{.mark} an island or archipelago [from China but also a means
of bringing an island or archipelago into closer relation with
its]{.mark} existing [colonial]{.mark} or metropolitan [state]{.mark}.
The USA is prominent here both because it has militarised numerous
island territories worldwide and because other Western and metropolitan
powers]{.underline} (e.g. Japan relative to Okinawa, Denmark relative to
Kalaallit Nunaat, Australia relative to Papua New Guinea, France
relative to New Caledonia) [cannot represent themselves as equal
competitors with China in a multipolar world and must position
themselves as allies of the USA and potential alternatives to China.
[Such a bipolar perspective]{.mark} [is unhelpful]{.mark} [for
islanders, who are cast as "pawns in a geopolitical chess game between
larger powers,"]{.mark} included within this or that sphere of
influence, [rather than as actors in their own right]{.mark}

### Link---extraction

#### Extractivism displaces [Indigenous ways of relating]{.underline} to the land---both [fossil fuels]{.underline} and [green tech]{.underline} require sacrificing Arctic indigenous peoples

[[Extractivism]{.mark} describes those activities that [violently remove
or extract large quantities]{.mark} of [natural resources]{.mark},
[causing]{.mark} major social and [ecological
damage]{.mark}]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011). The type, character and
degree of extractivism vary depending on the sector, style of
extraction, and context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021),
extractivisms -- in the plural, as there are many forms, such as mining,
fossil fuels, commercial agriculture and forestry -- entail breaking
down existing local economies and their ecological relationships, with
extracted products profiting national or international business classes
or governments[. [Extractivisms]{.mark}, however, [are]{.mark} not
limited to biophysical [overexploitation and transformation of the
environment]{.mark} (Acosta, 2011; Kröger et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019).
They are [based on onto-epistemic violence against Indigenous]{.mark}
[ways]{.mark} of relating to the Mother Earth (de la Cadena & Blaser,
2018). For example, replacing the latter with [modernist
assumptions]{.mark} and ideas where nature is seen as external and
available, \"free\" of people or any constraints to [exploit and
appropriate]{.mark} in]{.underline} whatever manner, as fast as wanted.
Therefore, Durante et al. (2021: 20) refer to extractivisms as \"a
particular way of thinking and the properties and practices organized
towards the goal of [maximizing benefit through extraction]{.underline},
which [brings]{.underline} in its wake [violence and
destruction]{.underline}. \" Such forms of colonialism and extractivism,
when part of capitalism, do not only mean imposing domination from
foreign countries and corporations. [Colonialism can]{.underline} also
[be imposed]{.underline} and continuously sustained internally [within a
nation state]{.underline} (Casanova, 1965; Churchill & LaDuke, 1992;
Maldonado-Torres, 2016). Arctic extractivisms exist with several forms
of colonial relations (Hanaček et al., 2022). The concept of climate
colonialism refers to how glaciers melting, sea levels rising, and
storms negatively affect those who have least contributed to the climate
crisis, such as Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and the
impoverished (Landrum & Holland, 2020; Naykanchina, 2012). [Systems
supporting colonialisms, such as]{.underline} patriarchy, racism,
Eurocentrism, and [extractivism]{.underline} not only contribute to such
conditions, but [also further impose their own climate change
perspectives and \"solutions\" (Sheller, 2023). [Climate change is in
part a result of colonial extractivism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
and a greater discussion of this connection in the literature has long
been necessary (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Moore, 2016). For instance,
projected green solutions and global climate interventions reproduce
extractive understandings and dominant discourses, including viewing
climate as merely a biophysical problem to be remedied with
technologies, finance, and better economic modelling (DeBoom, 2022;
Sultana, 2022). [[Apolitical approaches]{.mark}, with little to no
acknowledgment of global colonial histories, also [include adaptation,
vulnerability, and mitigation strategies]{.mark} that [continue to
displace]{.mark} historically impoverished [peoples from their
land]{.mark},]{.underline} disrupting plural ways of life and knowledge
(Cameron, 2012). According to Gelderloos (2022) and Osborne & Carlson
(2023), industrial expansion and present forms of pollution are
intrinsically linked to the colonial state. The current climate crisis
is the result of a state-corporate nexus responsible for atmospheric
change. However, the mainstream crisis solution to this nexus is based
on a carbon reduction 2030 goal, which is inherently linked to existing
fossil fuel and green extractivist initiatives (ibid).

Put simply, both [[green extractivism]{.mark} and the climate crisis
[perpetuate logics of colonialism and imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}
through negative socio-environmental impacts, discursive (green)
ignorance, climate crisis denial, and attempts to create domination and
hegemony by extractivist forces -- all these actions further driving the
climate catastrophe (DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023; Sultana,
2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). The term \"necrocene,\" or the new
era of death and extinction on Earth, refers to such denial and
silencing of historical and present struggles against socio-ecological
breakdown (Batalla, 2020; Clark, 2021; Mbembe, 2019). Therefore, the
poly-crisis including climatic breakdowns should be seen primarily as a
political state and a colonial condition (Sheller, 2023). Combined,
green extractivism and climate crises form part of ongoing
colonialities.

There is however resistance to extractivisms, challenging their
long-lasting systemic and environmental oppression (Acosta, 2011;
Escobar, 2011; Kröger, 2020; Scheidel et al., 2020; Svampa, 2016;
Willow, 2016). Environmental conflicts exist around the appropriation of
nature through efforts to preserve and protect ways of relating to
nature (Jerez et al., 2021). Connecting climate change and green
extractivism with acts of colonialism allows us to see how such constant
invasion of territory, exploitation, and industrial infrastructure in
the name of saving the planet fit into the larger picture of oppression
(Bhambra & Newell, 2023). The [[Arctic is a colonized
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has been historically subjected to
extractivism and additionally, it has been colonized by climate change
(Fjellheim, 2023; Kuokkanen, 2023; Össbo, 2023; Stuhl, 2016). Most
recently, [[\"green\" developments elicit]{.mark} additional opposition
(Bruna, 2022; Willow, 2016). Bladow (2019) shows that in Northern
Sweden, for example, with various kinds of [protest]{.mark} going on
including artistic expression, activists create global networks and
links in their protests [against extractivism]{.mark}, climate change,
[and other challenges to Sámi
self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Our article shows how
[green extractivisms and climate colonialisms are two sides of the same
coin]{.underline} by analyzing sixteen socio-environmental conflicts
across the Arctic, identified in the Global Atlas of Environmental
Justice (ejatlas.org) (Hanaček et al., 2022; Scheidel et al., 2020;
Temper et al., 2015) and through a literature review. The article
contributes to the political ecology of green transition by
conceptualizing these processes as extractive, with climate colonialisms
continuously affecting the region and its people.

### Link---Nuclear fears

#### Nuclear policy rests upon colonial entrenchment in internation relations that dictates victims of colonialism shall not be allowed to gain ground against their colonizers\-\--\"Until the lion tells his side of the story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter."

**Mishra and Amir, 22,** New Tech Nuclear Officer at the European
Leadership Network and a doctoral researcher at the Department of
Defence, King's College London; contractor with the US Department of
State as a national security adviser (Sylvia; Wardah, 2022, "Racial
Inequalities and Nuclear Policy")

The effects of British colonialism in South Asia are not just limited to
historical conflict and bloodshed but also can be seen in modern-day
relations between two independent nuclear states. While both India and
Pakistan violated the [nonproliferation]{.underline} norms set under the
NPT, the historical context reminds us that the colonials and the
victims of colonization are held to different standards set under the
same norms. At present, both the colonial state and those formerly
colonized possess nuclear weapons, but only the colonial receives the
title of a "nuclear weapon state" while those that bore the brunt of
colonialism are the "violators" of the NPT. We must look equally to all
states in possession of nuclear weapons as "violators" of international
norms, keeping in mind the historical context---not just from the
perspective of Western states.

These inequalities are also seen in multilateral regimes, such as the
Nuclear Suppliers Group, that have faced criticism for being exclusive
since not all countries can be members of these regimes, such as India
and Pakistan. To participate in this multilateral regime overseeing
nuclear exports, participants must be party to a nonproliferation
agreement and in compliance with the agreement. This excludes the South
Asian nuclear powers, limiting participation to the P5 with nuclear
privilege.21 Mod ern-day multilateral regimes like the Nuclear Suppliers
Group not only fail to be inclusive but also sustain international
inequities on what states are considered to be in compliance with
international norms (such as the United Kingdom---the colonial) and
which are not (such as India and Pakistan---the colonized).

Even prior to the nuclearization of South Asia, according to Stephen
Herzog, there was little concern among European and American
policymakers, or their publics, about British and French proliferation,
but plenty of racist fears of a nuclear "Red China." According to
Herzog, "This sparked panic that other states outside the West might go
nuclear and great interest in nonproliferation."22 As Rodgers notes,
"Some academics and defense analysts have argued that the NPT creates a
system of 'haves' and 'have nots.'" Under this paradigm, four of the P5
states are predominantly white nations: France, the United Kingdom, the
United States, and Russia.23

The creation of the nonproliferation norm, if viewed through a racial
lens, may have been for these predominantly white countries to maintain
the upper hand and exclude certain others from developing a nuclear
weapons program. Herzog says the NPT "aimed at preventing developing
states from getting the world's most powerful weapon." He also points
out that conveniently, the treaty presents vague language on
disarmament, which "has often served the purposes of policymakers in
states who seek to permanently maintain stockpiles of these
indiscriminate and disproportionate weapons."24 It adds to a power
dynamic between states with "nuclear privilege" and those without.

There is an African proverb that says, "Until the lion tells his side of
the story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter." This
proverb applies to the drafters and creators of the nonproliferation
norms we have come to accept. According to Intondi, Western nations have
taken the charge in writing, backing, and rallying support for the
international treaties under which norms against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction are set, with little to no input from
countries in Latin America or Africa. Similarly, Intondi observes, "We
tend to analyze \[the Cuban Missile Crisis\] through the lens of the US
or Soviet Union. But what about Cuba? It got little say in what happened
and was used as a pawn in the entire ordeal."

25 6 More recently, the Iran nuclear deal is an example of how the
United States chose to enter and then back out of an agreement. While
the United States and its allies agree that Iran should not acquire a
nuclear weapon, the unequal playing field shows again when Israel's
compliance (or the lack thereof) with internation al norms is not met
with a consistent response. Israel has never openly confirmed the
existence of its nuclear program but is estimated to have about 90
nuclear warheads. Israel has not supported efforts to establish a
WMD-free zone in the Middle East, nor has Israel ratified the Chemical
Weapons Convention or even signed the NPT.26 Intondi notes, "Why is
there no discussion about Israel giving up their nuclear weapons? They
remain the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons."27

As exceptional as [[Antarctica]{.underline}]{.mark} is when [[compared
to the rest of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[earth in terms of]{.mark} [its
physical geography,]{.mark} [it is]{.mark}]{.underline} often
[[regarded]{.underline}]{.mark} as even [[more exceptional for its
political geography]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Antarctic Treaty and its
associated instruments, often known collectively as [[the Antarctic
Treaty System]{.underline}]{.mark} (ATS), [[have
become]{.underline}]{.mark} emblematic of [[an innovative approach to
governance.]{.underline}]{.mark}1 In the standard telling, [[the
International Geophysical Year]{.underline}]{.mark} (IGY) (1957--58)
[[marked a decisive shift because]{.underline}]{.mark} its provision
that [[scientific activities would not have consequences for
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark} claims paved the way for the successful
negotiation of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, which entrenched [[the
continent as a space for science and peace with
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark} claims frozen (though definitely not
extinguished).2 [[Today]{.underline}]{.mark}, such [['Antarctic
exceptionalism' no longer stands up to scrutiny.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Declaring that [[Antarctica is not and has never been isolated
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the social[, [political and
economic]{.underline}]{.mark} contests that shaped the rest of the world
has fortunately become uncontroversial. James Cook's circumnavigation of
the continent in the late eighteenth century took place in the context
of British naval imperialism; the brutally effective harvesting of
Antarctic fur seals at the start of the nineteenth century made sense
only in the context of international capitalism; the [[Protocol on
Environmental Protection]{.underline}]{.mark} at the end of the
twentieth century [[injustice responded to concerns over political, as
well as environmental, through the potential effects of mining;
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the current [[failure to agree on the
designation of new Marine Protected Areas in the Southern
Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark} reflects [[wider]{.mark} [geopolitical
tensions, with Russia and China]{.mark}]{.underline} repeatedly
[[blocking proposals]{.underline}]{.mark}.3 Even [[the
Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[is now]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[recognized]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} many ways
[[a]{.underline} [product of its political
circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than being wholly exceptional
to them.4 [[Setting asid]{.underline}e]{.mark} a portion of the earth
from [[militarization dovetailed neatly with the overarching aims of the
superpowers]{.underline}]{.mark} -- to [[establish]{.underline}]{.mark}
a space where prior claims to [[supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}
(sovereignty) would be negated, and the [[dominant currency of prestige
would be science, which in turn was a function of financial resources
and political will.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[As Arctic states grapple with]{.underline}]{.mark}** changing
conceptualizations of their northern frontiers and consider
**[[expanding]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omic
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** there, unresolved **[[questions
regarding]{.mark} the [limits of]{.mark} state
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Arctic Ocean
**[[constrain]{.mark} their [efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is
our contention that [ongoing contestation of sovereignty]{.mark} in the
Arctic is [rooted in]{.mark} the region's indeterminate and [unstable
geophysical characteristics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Historically,
**[[ideals of sovereignty]{.mark} have [assume]{.mark}d a basic
elemental [distinction]{.mark} [between land]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
recognized as amenable to sedentarization and hence
territorialization**[, [and water]{.mark}]{.underline}**, designated as
resistant to these assertions of control (Steinberg 2001, 2009).
**[[Even those who argue]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} fundamental
[shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the relationship between land power and
sea power **[[occurred]{.mark} in the late nineteenth
century]{.underline}** (e.g., Mackinder 1904; Schmitt 2006)
**[[expand]{.mark} the [ontological]{.mark} [distinction between]{.mark}
Earth's two essential surface features---boundable [land and]{.mark}
unboundable [water]{.mark}---[into]{.mark} an [epistemological
principle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[This]{.mark} pairing of two
apparently fixed and totalizing binaries]{.underline}**---land versus
water and boundable territory versus unboundable
nonterritory---**[[resonates with a]{.mark} long-standing [tendency
to]{.mark} assert difference and belonging by [fus]{.mark}ing
"[meta-geographic" reifications]{.mark} of territorial landmasses [with
appeals to "commonsense" materiality]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lewis and
Wigen 1997). However, **[[commonsense
materiality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is always contestable**[, is
particularly [problematic in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Lopez 2001; Davidson 2005), especially amidst climate change. At the
most basic level, the binary division of Earth into land and water is
confounded in the Arctic by the presence of ice, a liminal substance
that combines and confuses properties of the two. Beneath the cover of
ice, it is not always clear where land ends and water begins (Pyne 1998;
Laidler 2006), a situation that has long frustrated state constructions
of power and knowledge in polar regions, whether gazing from the bow of
a research vessel or analyzing an image taken by a satellite (Wrakberg
2004; Yusoff 2005). Furthermore, today's ˚ ice could be tomorrow's
water. Like the ever-shifting tectonic plates of Massey's (2005, 2006)
landscape (cf. J. T. Wilson 1963), [[Arctic materiality]{.mark}, stable
in neither time nor space, [complicates]{.mark} the [ideal of permanence
that underpins]{.mark} modern [concepts of
sovereignty]{.mark},]{.underline} just as it complicates the practice of
polar science (Frazar 2008). **[[Given this disparity]{.mark}
between]{.underline}** the **[idealized]{.underline}** [materiality of
the system of territorially delimited sovereign states]{.underline}
**[and]{.underline}** the **[actual materiality]{.underline}** of the
Arctic[, **[it is]{.underline}**]{.mark} perhaps **[[not
surprising]{.mark} that]{.underline}** practices of
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** and statehood in the region have
**[[diverged from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[modern
[norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For many northern coastal peoples, for
example, materiality is not limited to land and water but incorporates
sea ice, seasonal land-fast ice, and the shifting spaces in between,
together with localized connections among varying types of wind and
water currents, animal behaviors, tidal stages, snow, temperature, and
the processes that operate underneath the ice cover (Kerttula 2000;
Aporta 2002; Jolly et al. 2002). Such varying conceptions of **[the
Arctic's materiality]{.underline}** can **[lead to political
institutions that stray even further from the modern
ideal]{.underline}**. **[Because the Arctic has been governed from
non-Arctic capitals, the region has seen a number of variations on the
practice of sovereignty]{.underline}**. For instance, British
sovereignty in the Canadian Arctic historically was mediated by the
relatively autonomous territorial control exercised by the Hudson's Bay
Company. The Spitzbergen Treaty of 1920 gives Norway sovereignty over
Svalbard but with certain provisions that limit Norway's control over
economic resources. In several countries in the region, indigenous
peoples have some level of autonomy. Further complicating these
gradations of sovereignty, northern peoples often assert circumpolar
bonds that transcend state structures and cross state borders, as in the
case of the Barents Euro-Arctic Region, which brings together nonstate,
state, and suprastate (the European Union) actors for regional
governance. Even the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS; United Nations 1982), a document that fundamentally reinforces
the idealized political--juridical separation of water from land,
establishes a special regime for areas with "particularly severe
climatic conditions and the presence of ice covering such areas for most
of the year" (Article 234), where coastal states are granted additional
jurisdiction with respect to the environment in their Exclusive Economic
Zones (EEZs). In short, **[the [history of sovereignty in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} [reflects]{.mark} ongoing [attempts to square
the]{.mark} multifaceted and unstable nature of [Arctic materiality
with]{.mark} a [constructed ontology]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[(or, to
use Schmitt's term, a nomos) [that assumes]{.mark} a fixed [division
between land and water]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, **[[as states pursue
this]{.mark} goal, the [Arctic's climate]{.mark} is [becoming more
volatile]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Past ambiguities and inaccessibility
can no longer be relied on by coastal states, and [this]{.mark} is
[lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} a [scramble]{.mark} [for]{.mark} new
material [foundations]{.mark} on which [to base sovereign
claims]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[In Canada]{.underline}**, one of
several Arctic states in which current and past governments have
directed resources to the northern frontier, **[officials have been
particularly eager to classify the region's dynamic
materiality]{.underline}**. In support of these efforts, some have
suggested that Canada is less a continental landmass than an
archipelago: a nation of land and water (and the liminal ice that
mediates this division; Vannini et al. 2009). Indeed**[, [if ice creates
ambiguity, it allows water to be]{.mark} construed as solid
[territory]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Canadian jurist Donat Pharand has
written, when arguing for drawing straight baselines around Canada's
coasts, **["The quasi-permanency of the ice over the enclosed waters
bolsters the physical unity of land and sea"]{.underline}** (Pharand
2007, 19). A senior official with Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs
and International Trade (DFAIT) elaborated on this point: We're dealing
with virtually the world's only archipelago, certainly the world's only
large archipelago, which has ice-covered areas throughout its surface.
The question is what is the status of that ice vis-a-vis the land around
it \` . \... At some point we may end up before an international court
\[and\] we will bring evidence that shows the people of the Canadian
North, or Canadian citizens, in the winter time have treated the ice
exactly the same as the land, and we'll make a very strong argument for
that. (Interview, June 2008; see also Byers 2010; Fenge 2007--2008)
**[The [focus on ice]{.mark} has been [so intense that]{.mark} Canadian
[nationalists]{.mark} [have not considered]{.mark} the other aspects of
Article 234, "[severe climatic conditions]{.mark}," which some models
forecast will become even more extreme with a hitherto unexperienced
Arctic hurricane season]{.underline}** (Kolstad and Bracegirdle 2008).
**[[This suggests that geopolitical arguments]{.mark} are [driven
by]{.mark} popular idealizations of a place---[territorial
imaginaries]{.mark}---as well as legal precedents and
statutes.]{.underline}** Historically[, [territorial
imaginaries]{.underline}]{.mark} [have [served as]{.mark} [foundations
for]{.mark} constructions of [sovereignty by referring to territory
as]{.mark} solid and stable---boundable [units of land that can
be]{.mark} charted, [demarcated]{.mark}, and mapped to signify the
"body" of the nation.]{.underline} In the Arctic, [[states]{.mark} often
seek to [perpetuate these traditional]{.mark} and assumed [ways
of]{.mark} defining and [delimiting sovereign jurisdiction]{.mark},
[notwithstanding the]{.mark} region's increasing material [instability
brought]{.mark} about [by climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
expound on this proposition [[we turn to three
debates]{.underline}]{.mark} in the contemporary Arctic: [[the question
of sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Northwest Passage[,
[conflicts over control]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic Ocean,
[[and]{.mark} the [potential for]{.mark} enhanced multilateral
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. [[Through]{.mark} our
study of [these debates]{.mark}, [we engage the Arctic]{.mark} both
[as]{.mark} a region that is [undergoing climate change]{.mark}'s most
extreme impacts [and]{.mark} as [a space for understanding how these
impacts]{.mark} can [modify]{.mark} the [territorial organization
of]{.mark} political [authority in the region]{.mark} and

### Link---Surveillance (radar)

#### The form of American colonization is internal- [militarized radar]{.underline} is surveillance to dehumanize the relationship between the Indigenous peoples' and land, using policy and law to oppress- made into ghosts haunting the stolen land

The other form of colonialism that is attended to by postcolonial
theories and theories of coloniality is **[[internal
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the biopolitical and
**[[geopolitical management of people, land]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
flora and fauna **[[within the "domestic" borders]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the imperial nation. This involves the [**[use of]{.mark}**
particularized **[modes of control]{.mark}**]{.underline} - prisons,
ghettos, minoritizing, schooling[**[, policing]{.mark}** - to ensure the
ascendancy of a nation and its white3 elite.]{.underline} These modes of
control, imprisonment, and involuntary transport of the human beings
across borders - ghettos, their policing, their economic divestiture,
and their dislocatability - are at work to authorize the metropole and
conscribe her periphery. [Strategies of internal colonialism, such as
**[segregation]{.mark}**, divestment**[, surveillance]{.mark}**, and
criminalization, are both **[structural and
interpersonal]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Our intention in this descriptive exercise is not be exhaustive, or even
inarguable; instead, we wish to emphasize that (a) decolonization will
take a different shape in each of these contexts - though they can
overlap4 - and that (b) neither external nor internal colonialism
adequately describe the form of colonialism which operates in the United
States or other nation-states in which the colonizer comes to stay.
Settler colonialism operates through internal/external colonial modes
simultaneously because there is no spatial separation between metropole
and colony. For example, in the United States, many Indigenous peoples
have been forcibly removed from their homelands onto reservations,
indentured, and abducted into state custody, signaling the form of
colonization as simultaneously internal (via boarding schools and other
biopolitical modes of control) and external (via uranium mining on
Indigenous land in the US Southwest and oil extraction on Indigenous
land in Alaska) with a frontier (the US military still nicknames all
enemy territory "Indian Country"). **[The horizons of the settler
colonial nation-state are total and require [a mode of]{.mark} total
[appropriation of Indigenous life and land]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
rather than the selective expropriation of profit-producing fragments.

Settler colonialism is different from other forms of colonialism in that
settlers come with the intention of making a new home on the land, **[[a
homemaking]{.mark} that [insists on settler sovereignty]{.mark} over all
things]{.underline}** in their new domain. Thus, relying solely on
postcolonial literatures or theories of coloniality that ignore settler
colonialism will not help to envision the shape that decolonization must
take in settler colonial contexts. Within settler colonialism, the most
important concern is land/water/air/subterranean earth (land, for
shorthand, in this article.) Land is what is most valuable, contested,
required. This is both because the settlers make Indigenous land their
new home and source of capital, and also because **[[the disruption of
Indigenous relationships to land represents a profound epistemic,
ontological,]{.mark} cosmological [violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This
violence is not [[temporally]{.underline}]{.mark} contained in the
arrival of the settler but is **[[reasserted each day of
occupation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is why Patrick Wolfe (1999)
emphasizes that settler colonialism is a structure and not an event. In
the process [of **[set]{.mark}**tler **[col]{.mark}**onialism,
**[land]{.mark}** is remade **[into property]{.mark}** and human
**[relationships to land]{.mark}** are **[restricted]{.mark}** to the
relationship of the **[owner to]{.mark}** his
**[property.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Epistemological, ontological, and
cosmological relationships to land are interred, indeed [made pre-modern
and backward. **[Made savage]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

In order for the [settlers to make a place their home, they must destroy
and disappear the Indigenous peoples that live there]{.underline}.
Indigenous peoples are those who have creation stories, not colonization
stories, about how we/they came to be in a particular place - indeed how
we/they came to be a place. Our/their relationships to land comprise
our/their epistemologies, ontologies, and cosmologies. [For the
settlers, Indigenous peoples are in the way and, in the destruction of
Indigenous peoples, Indigenous communities, and **[over time]{.mark} and
[through law and policy,]{.mark}** Indigenous peoples' claims to land
under settler regimes, **[land is recast as property and]{.mark}** as a
**[resource.]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** must be erased, must be **[[made into
ghosts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Tuck and Ree, forthcoming).

At the same time[, settler colonialism involves the subjugation and
forced labor of chattel slaves5 , whose bodies and lives become the
property, and who are kept landless. Slavery in settler colonial
contexts is distinct from]{.underline} other forms of indenture whereby
excess labor is extracted from persons. First, [chattels are commodities
of labor and therefore it is the slave's person that is the
excess.]{.underline} Second, [unlike workers who may aspire to own land,
the slave's very presence on the land is already an excess that must be
dis-located]{.underline}. Thus, t[he slave is a desirable commodity but
the person underneath is imprisonable, punishable, and
murderable.]{.underline} The violence of keeping/killing the chattel
slave makes them deathlike monsters in the settler imagination; [they
are reconfigured/disfigured as the threat, the razor's edge of safety
and terror]{.underline}

**[[The settler]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if known by his actions and how
he justifies them, **[[sees himself as holding dominion over the
earth]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its flora and fauna, [as the
anthropocentric normal, and as **[more developed, more human, more
deserving]{.mark}** than other groups or species.]{.underline} The
settler is making [a new \"home]{.underline}\" and that home is rooted
in a homesteading worldview [**[where the]{.mark}** wild **[land
and]{.mark}** wild **[people were made for his
benefit]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He can only make his identity as a
settler by making the land produce, and produce excessively, because
\"civilization\" is defined as production in excess of the \"natural\"
world (i.e. in excess of the sustainable production already present in
the Indigenous world). In order for excess production, he needs excess
labor, which he cannot provide himself. The chattel slave serves as that
excess labor, labor that can never be paid because payment would have to
be in the form of property (land). The settler\'s wealth is land, or a
fungible version of it, and so payment for labor is impossible.6 The
settler positions himself as both superior and normal; the settler is
natural, whereas the Indigenous inhabitant and the chattel slave are
unnatural, even supernatural.

Settlers are not immigrants. Immigrants are beholden to the Indigenous
laws and epistemologies of the lands they migrate to. Settlers become
the law, supplanting Indigenous laws and epistemologies. Therefore,
settler nations are not immigrant nations (See also A.J. Barker, 2009).
Not unique, the United States, as a settler colonial nation-state, also
operates as an empire - [utilizing external forms and internal forms of
colonization simultaneous to the settler colonial project.]{.underline}
This means, and this is perplexing to some, that dispossessed people are
brought onto seized Indigenous land through other colonial projects.
Other colonial projects include enslavement, as discussed, but also
military recruitment, low-wage and high-wage labor recruitment (such as
agricultural workers and overseas-trained engineers), and
displacement/migration (such as the coerced immigration from nations
torn by U.S. wars or devastated by U.S. economic policy). In this set of
settler colonial relations, colonial subjects who are displaced by
external colonialism, as well as [racialized and minoritized by internal
colonialism,]{.underline} still occupy and settle stolen Indigenous
land. Settlers are diverse, not just of white European descent, and
include people of color, even from other colonial contexts. This tightly
wound set of conditions and racialized, globalized relations
exponentially complicates what is meant by decolonization, and by
solidarity, against settler colonial forces

## Impact

### Impact---colonial violence

#### Colonial Expansion in the Artic means forced migrations, genocide, and wipes indigenous identity

geopolitics) "State Expansion and Indigenous Response in the Arctic: A
Globally Integrated Northern Borderland Emerges from the Historical
Synthesis of Northern Frontier and Northern Homeland" chp 5. In Coates,
Kenneth, and Carin Holroyd, eds. *The Palgrave handbook of Arctic policy
and politics*. Vol. 569. Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2020.

[Since [the state and its colonial proxies]{.mark} first
[encroached]{.mark} upon [their homeland]{.mark} three centuries ago,
[natives of the North have]{.mark}]{.underline} [[continued to
assert]{.mark} and defend their Aboriginal [rights and]{.mark} cultural
[traditions]{.mark}, and have sought to preserve as much of the
autonomy]{.underline} of [[their independent polities now threatened by
state expan]{.underline}sion as they could]{.mark}. As natives learned
more about the many systems and structures of governance that were
exported from Eurasia, from the commercial trading posts and early
global networks they were part of, to the representative constitutional
democracies that took root in their homelands, they found many new ways
to reassert and, increasingly, restore their autonomy---through
innovative domestic diplomacy, protracted (sometimes multi-decade)
negotiations, and various forms of political protest and engagement
(including the omnipresent threat of litigation to delay development
projects proposed for their homeland). This contrasted sharply with
elsewhere [[in the Americas]{.mark} where [the]{.mark} modern [state
collided]{.mark} more [forcefully]{.mark} (and with greater kinetic
energy) [with]{.mark} [the interests and sovereign aspirations]{.mark}
of hundreds [of indigenous empires, nations, and
tribes]{.mark}]{.underline} from the late fifteenth century
onward---[[the result]{.mark} of which [was annihilatory warfare,
genocide, forced migrations, and coercive assimilation policies]{.mark}
reminiscent of what took place elsewhere in the world [when states
expanded onto indigenous]{.mark}ly self-governing
[lands]{.mark}---[resulting in]{.mark} the general [extinguishment of
indigenous identity]{.mark} even as [tribes brilliantly and heroically
fought back]{.mark} against the state, [but inevitably lost to the
state]{.mark}'s superior military power.]{.underline}

[[Global temperature rises]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[led
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[rapid increase in]{.mark} permafrost
[temperatures]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}, and this has
[[caused fast-expanding permafrost thawing especially in the Northern
Hemisphere]{.mark}]{.underline} (Biskaborn et al. 2019). The degradation
of the permafrost system has been dramatic between the 1970s and 2018
for example in the Western Russian Arctic (Vasiliev et al. 2020). This
[[thawing of the permafrost has already passed a **tipping
point**]{.underline}]{.mark} and will continue for hundreds of years
even if the emission of greenhouse gases by humans were immediately
halted (Randers & Goluke 2020). The [methane and other greenhouse gases
that the Arctic thawing is now releasing will further accelerate this
process]{.underline}, making developments in the near decades unstable
for an assumed continuation of extraction. Scientists have warned that
this process will be further increased as there are very few signs of
decreasing emissions; instead **[the [focus has shifted toward net-zero
targets in the distant future and dubious offsetting schemes and other
false solutions to address the climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(e.g.
https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/12/11/10-myths-net-zero-targets-carbon-
offsetting-busted/). The potential of carbon that will be emitted from
permafrost thawing is massive, estimates running from 260 to 360 billion
tonnes of carbon, a considerable part of which will thaw abruptly and
not gradually, these abrupt emissions greatly increasing the release
projections (Merritt et al. 2019). Just a tiny fraction of this emission
potential would have catastrophic impacts (Smith 2011).

There are a few studies which have started to incorporate the
aforementioned situation into their prognoses, although the vast
majority, based on my review, suggests that most analyses are oblivious
to these facts, or ignore them. Hjort et al. (2018) claims to be the
first study detailing the fundamental infrastructure which is at risk
across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost area due to climate changes.
They argue that [**[by 2050, about 69% of]{.mark}** the **pan-[Arctic
infra]{.mark}structure** that is **[essential to human life]{.mark}** in
these conditions, including housing, transport, and industry facilities,
will be **[in areas of high potential for permafrost thaw]{.mark}** near
the surface]{.underline}. They also note that even if the Paris
Agreement target is reached, most Arctic infrastructures would be at
risk. This includes such central extractive infra-structures as the
1,590-kilometer Eastern Siberia--Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, 1,260
kilo-meters of gas pipelines originating in the Yamal-Nenets region, and
550 kilometers of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (Hjort et al. 2018).
This suggests that especially [hydrocarbon extraction will become
extremely difficult, too costly, or socio-environmentally
hazardous]{.underline}, as the [constant thawing will require
re-building]{.underline} the [pipelines]{.underline}. As the costs of
merely trying to upkeep the existing industrial structures, buildings
and essential logistics of extraction are extremely high, there will be
fewer funds for expansion projects. For example, Streletskiy et al.
(2019) estimate that by 2050, Russia will need to spend over 100 billion
USD to sustain its existing infrastructures that will be damaged by
thawing. Producing cheap commodities that rely on massive
infrastructures, such as hydrocarbons, is thus likely to be hard, even
impossible. Moreover, the situation will become even worse due to the
currently rapidly decreasing funding given to hydrocarbon expansion
projects, and the massive and rising costs, and lowering returns, that
the pumping of oil and gas in the Arctic would produce. Similarly,
slurry pipelines for pumping minerals with water are likely to be
unfeasible in the Arctic. A more likely, and less costly, outcome in the
worst thawing regions is for the people now living in extractive towns'
old buildings which are collapsing to be moved to other regions, where
upkeeping infrastructure will be less costly, and where the rapidly
cascading effects and risks of thawing are less likely. This suggests
that very large areas of Siberia and North America would become more
akin to wasteland than usable targets for land grab-bing, as investing
would be far too risky and short-lived.

These barriers set by climatic catastrophes are not limited to land, but
also affect the seas. Coastal and offshore operations will suffer from
increasing storms and drifting ice, which already make the situation so
perilous that, along with other factors such as the unavailability of
funds, or close enough ports, make other Arctic seas except the
Norwegian-controlled Barents Sea highly unlikely, even impossible sites
of expanding drilling (Eliasson 2017). The melting perennial and
multi-year Arctic ice will not only raise sea levels, but will lead to
extinctions of microorganisms dependent on ice. This will lead to
dramatic existential problems for Arctic life, including the many
fishing and hunting dependent populations (Dodds & Nuttall 2019).

These prognoses make it clear that not only will forecast expansions
into permafrost and ice cover areas be much more difficult than
expected, even impossible, but that the existing logistics and
extraction operations relying on steady ground are also likely to be
damaged. Those who have invested in Arctic extraction and exploitation
permits, leased land and extraction rights, or have already invested in
infrastructures and operations, are [going to face rising and unexpected
risks.]{.underline} As Francis (2018: 17) notes in her Scientific
American climate change special issue article, which showcases how the
Arctic is changing much faster than predicted, coming closer to tipping
points with feedback loops, it is time to "prepare for the unexpected."

Neglect of the Climate Crisis in Arctic Government Policies

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the above and other scientific studies
and local peoples' complaints, which clearly point toward the
[[necessity to take]{.mark} future and already happening [crises
seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[governments interested in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** or situated there
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** mostly **[[going in]{.mark} the [opposite
direction in]{.mark}]{.underline}** their
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Newlin et al. (2021) note how
extremely ill-equipped current Russian regional governments are to
respond to the above challenges, due to lack of funds: they are already
in heavy debt and falling into bankruptcy. In this haphazard situation,
ecological catas-trophes such as leakages from pipelines and factories
into rivers and elsewhere have increased, as [environmental regulations
and infrastructural investments are overlooked]{.underline}. The time of
cheap commodities seems to be thus already ending, as Moore (2015) has
generally noted, and as I can confirm from my studies about the Arctic
and the case of the Finnish mining boom, where costs of investing and
operations have exceeded the returns in the key expansion projects
(Kröger 2016). However, [[**governments** across the Arctic
still]{.mark}]{.underline} seem to [[**push**]{.mark} the [**Arctic land
and resource rush further**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are major Arctic
pulp investment, mining, tourism, and wind energy booms currently in
Finland, and some of these booms are also present in Norway, Sweden,
Iceland and Greenland. Instead of investing in alter-natives, Russia is
focusing heavily on increasing its capacity of hydrocarbon power
pro-duction (Newlin et al. 2021). The actual and political costs of
these moves, which tie the energy matrix for years to come to fossil
fuels, will increase.

There also seem to be [diverging resource grabbing trajectories between
the Arctic regions]{.underline}. The EU (2020) estimates that North
America will not engage in large-scale Arctic oil extraction as it has
also less costly and smaller-scale options. The EU (2020) Arctic Policy
paper suggests that it is much more likely that [[Norway and Russia will
continue their Arctic oil extraction expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}, due
to sunk costs in Norway, that being possibly the easiest option seen for
GDP growth in Russia by its current decision-makers. Staalesen (2020),
assessing the Russian energy and climate policies, shows how [[climate
change]{.mark} is [recognized in Russia, but]{.mark}]{.underline}
basically [[nothing has been done]{.mark} to prepare for
it]{.underline}: instead, expanding hydrocarbon extraction is framed as
essential and no alternatives are seen as viable. This has made many,
including Sukhankin (2020), who wonders about the Russian 2035 coal
strategy (which foresees major expansion), ask "Why does Russia ignore
this rapidly shifting reality?" This refers to Russia merely preparing
to adapt to some climate changes, but not combating them (Staalesen
2020). Tynkkynen (2018) assesses the reasons for this. According to him,
the Russian state has a specific, hydrocarbon giant rhetoric directed
toward domestic audiences, which makes the negative effects of climate
change social ta-boos. This rhetoric also exaggerates the economic
potential of Arctic industrialization and downplays the dependence on
just hydrocarbons. [The practice of [compensating Indigenous people for
pollution and loss of habitat]{.mark}]{.underline} in a way that
[[merely seeks to stifle criticism]{.underline}]{.mark} is another
example of the balancing act by the Russian state to keep the
constructed hydro-carbon identities alive, argues Tynkkynen. The longer
this hydrocarbon rhetoric continues, the more likely the aforementioned
predictions on the magnitude and timing of planetary catastrophes due to
climate disruptions will become.

These kinds of moves suggest that technological lock-ins are being
built, based on existing grabbing trajectories, such as in the Norwegian
focus on offshore drilling and the so-called blue economy of extracting
everything from the seabed that is possible. The propensity of such sunk
costs tends to be for invested-in projects to be continued, even if they
would be highly problematic, unprofitable, or destructive. This is
because someone has already invested in them and wants -- or even needs
-- to make money to pay debts, or to continue resource grabbing in other
places. Yet, at some point in the near future, it is likely that this
situation of ever-expanding resource frontiers for at least the past 550
years, will come to loggerheads with the harsh realities. This is
expected to happen faster **[[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** than
elsewhere, as **[[the temperature rises there are two to three times
higher than elsewhere]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the natural
condi-tions are much more fragile. Francis (2018: 52) calls the Arctic
the "canary in the coal mine" for the whole earth. While there are more
natural resources in the Arctic than in many other places, these are not
available for extraction in sensible terms.

Besides natural barriers, [there are also **particular [international
politics]{.mark}** which strongly **[impact]{.mark}** the [**pace**
**and style of extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Leroux and Spiro
(2018) note the [**[crucial]{.mark}** importance of [interstate
competition]{.mark}: if **[one starts to extract, others]{.mark}** can
make use of the solutions and technologies, and have the impetus to
**[invest as well]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [Russian will to
expand]{.underline} hydrocarbon [extraction]{.underline} has been
[greatly affected by West]{.underline}ern sanctions, without which it
has proven to be impossible for Russian operators to expand oil
operations in the Arctic, as this would require extensive technological
developments and Western funds (Morgunova 2020). Nationalist agendas,
such as Russia's 2007 planting of its flag by submarines on the ocean
floor of the North Pole, seem to have slowed down a joint capitalist
rush to the Arctic. Inter-state rivalry between some Arctic nations,
visible in the race for who gets to first claim and grab sea areas has,
curiously, been an impediment to starting offshore and port-expanding
projects in the same manner as forecasted earlier. In this setting,
imposing greater environmental regulation has been interpreted by other
would-be Arctic extractive nations as a sign that a country would not be
so interested in expanding to the Arctic -- something that Leroux and
Spiro (2018) argue has deterred expansion thrusts. But national thrusts
of expansion remain. Besides Russia, Morgunova (2020) explains that the
will to expand into the Arctic, and citizen support for this, is high
also in Norway. This makes Norway the most likely candidate for being
the first nation to start Arctic extractive operations, as it has funds,
making what happens in Norway and its initial operations extremely
important for the whole region's future.

Market and Social Responses to Worsening Extraction Possibilities

While governments are trying to promote Arctic resource rushes, global
markets and investors have already started to look in other directions.
The drastic decrease in oil prices in 2020, linked to COVID-19 pandemic
politics, and to Russian and Saudi Arabian maneuvers to make use of a
multiple global crisis to push oil prices down (as they can sustain
lower prices longer than other oil producers, thus capturing markets in
the end), and the rising flow of investments to so-called renewables
instead of hydrocarbons, have dramatically lessened the likelihood of
Arctic offshore oil investments. Carayannis et al. (2021) estimate that
in this current situation, oil and gas companies are unable to utilize
their unique competencies, and that only one or two large projects may
materialize in the Arctic. Considering this slowdown of investments from
the viewpoint of Leroux and Spiro (2018), who emphasize that not
investing does not cause leakage to other regions, but in fact creates a
strong regional policy of not engaging in extraction, COVID-19, low oil
prices, and the shift to renewables investments that have taken place in
the past two to three years, give some hope in the timeline. Since the
longer the perilous investments that would increase emissions are
postponed, the harder and less likely it will become for companies to
realize them.

This consideration of timelines is essential and suggests that the
currently budding re-sistance to Arctic resource extraction projects is
essential and well-timed and would need to be supported and expanded in
scale and scope. The Arctic context is changing so rapidly that even a
few years can show the instability of this setting for investments -- in
which case the would-be investors, at least those losing money, should
in fact be grateful for the current resistance against their ill-thought
moves to expand extraction. Shell had to pay a heavy prize of several
billion USD when abandoning its Alaska offshore oil exploration, amid
rising Greenpeace and other global protests against these moves. Other
companies are likely to take note of the risks of consumer boycotts as
well, as even one oil leakage in the Arctic seas would be devastating
for the fragile environments and the people relying on them. Such an
accident would signify a drastic end to the extraction pushes, but
hopefully Norway or other actors are not going to test their luck so far
as to realize those risks.

Arctic Social Scientific Contributions to Global Land Grabbing Studies

The aforementioned discussion has focused on the biophysical changes
which strongly suggest that future resource rushes in the Arctic will
not take place in the way fathomed thus far. The bulk of global and
Arctic resource extraction has focused on hydrocarbons. This energy
sector is also the most important due to the pivotal role it has played
and continues to play in emissions. There are, however, also other
[important sectors]{.underline} that [are]{.underline} also [causing
climatic and ecological impacts, and are involved in land grabbing
across the Arctic]{.underline}. Hydrocarbon [**[projects have been
placed on Indigenous lands and]{.mark}** periodically **[put]{.mark}**
Indigenous and **[conservation areas at risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
studies in Alaska and Russia (Kumpula et al. 2011) have shown. Wilson
and Stammler (2016) have introduced a special issue around Arctic
extractivisms, arguing how [[extractivist logics have pushed many locals
into supporting extractivist projects]{.underline}]{.mark}. However,
there are variations to this, and since 2016, there has been significant
mobilization against extractivism in the Arctic, for example among the
Sámi (Kuokkanen 2019). Locals have engaged in such acts of resistance as
countermapping their territories against mining projects' mapping of
"resources," and in emphasizing the place-specific, unique qualities
which cannot be compensated if destroyed by open-pit mines (Lassila
2018; 2020). In comparison to the Global South, with its heavily
oppressive and violent polities and contexts of extraction, the Arctic
setting does seem to offer some more room for agency by locals and
would-be resistance against extractive projects, even in Russia
according to Stammler and Ivanova (2016). Yet, here as elsewhere, this
resistance does not surge automatically as a response to grievances but
needs to be built by active agency and specific resistance strategies
(Kröger 2013; 2020).

While I have argued here that much of the Arctic land and resource rush
remains at the level of hype and will not be realized due to the climate
and ecological collapses, there are several existing and new projects in
parts of the Arctic that are currently expanding. These include mining
projects to secure rare earth and other minerals for the transition to
battery- based electric vehicles as a supposed solution in a move away
from hydrocarbons. The moves to expand wind energy have been heavily
criticized for the damage it causes, and because it leads to land
grabbing of Indigenous land in the Global South (Dunlap & Jakobsen
2020). Lapland is now starting to experience these conflicts related to
wind farm expansion plans. Resistance experiences of what works in the
Global South, where **[[people have already experienced heavily violent
extractive expansions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and learned how to resist
them (see Kröger 2020), could be used by the Arctic populations to
resist land grabs in their region. In fact, this is already happening,
as the Arctic is becoming increasingly global, and connected to all
sorts of global politics and interactions (Finger & Heininen 2019).

### Impact---ice melts

#### Ice melts are catastrophic for indigenous arctic peoples---it wrecks cultural heritage and economic independence, forcing relocation

[[Climate change has had a profound impact on the living environment of
Arctic indigenous peoples]{.mark}, and thus, it merits special
attention]{.underline}. The Artic is characterised 'as the world's
climate change barometer'.^25^ According to the reports of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC[), 'surface warming in
the Arctic will continue to be more pronounced than the global average
warming over the 21st century']{.underline}.[26 It is expected that
['additional warming will lead to more frequent and intense marine
heatwaves and is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing and
loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, land ice and Arctic sea
ice]{.mark}']{.underline}.^27^ A significant decline in sea ice and
glaciers is already being witnessed in the Chukchi and Beaufort
seas.^28^ [Decline in seasonal sea ice and higher sea levels increase
coastal hazards, such as flooding and coastal
erosion]{.underline}.^29^ [[Such changes have resulted
in]{.mark},]{.underline} and are projected to further lead to[[,
restrictions on indigenous peoples' access to ancestral lands and
natural resources, loss of land and houses or forced relocation and mass
resettlements,]{.underline}]{.mark} which directly affect the enjoyment
of the right to property.^30^ In addition, [there have been serious
consequences for the main sources of income of indigenous
communities]{.underline}, as [the [thinning of ice makes it more
difficult to hunt and fish and climate change has led to the degradation
of reindeer pastures and to a lack of available food for reindeer
herding.31]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Ocean warming and acidification]{.underline} [are also responsible for
the depletion of fish stocks and decline in other marine species,
limiting the opportunities of Arctic indigenous people to access marine
resources, threatening their income, food security and cultural
heritage]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}^32^ Reduction in sea ice
may facilitate overfishing, which, in turn, is likely to affect the fish
stocks and the fishing practices of Arctic indigenous peoples, many of
whom rely on small-scale subsistence fishing.^33^ Sea-level rise can
also change coastal configuration or lead to the partial or complete
loss of islands. This will affect the baselines from which maritime
zones are measured and may result in their reduction or
disappearance. ^34^ Such scenario could severely limit the access of the
Arctic indigenous communities to natural resources, including their
fishing rights.

Beyond the direct impact that rising temperatures have on the enjoyment
of the living environment of the indigenous communities, it is worth
evaluating the indirect impact that climate change has had on it[. [The
receding ice cap has made the waters more navigable. Enhanced
accessibility has been associated with a growth in all forms of
shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 [Ship operations are [associated with
high risks for the marine environment, such as pollution (oil, air and
noise pollution, sewage and garbage) and damage or disruption to the
marine ecosystem through ballast water and hull biofouling or by
icebreaking and animal deaths caused by ship strikes.]{.mark}36 Black
carbon emissions from shipping and oil spills have been a major cause
for alarm because of the disastrous impact they could have on the
fragile ecosystem of the coastal communities]{.underline}. The rapid
expansion of extractive activities has also caused concern to the Arctic
indigenous communities. [[Pipelines, oil and gas extraction and
production]{.mark} are known for transforming and polluting the
environment in diverse ways [forcing the Arctic indigenous peoples to
relocate or adapt their social and economic practices to different ways
of living, such as by adapting their harvesting, hunting and fishing
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}37 Considering the changes reported in
the Arctic environment, which have a significant impact on the
livelihoods of indigenous peoples, the next section explores the extent
to which regional human rights law can contribute to protecting the
right to property against some of the effects of climate change.

#### Racial securitization constructs a permanent war machine -- the state survives by turning the Other into terror and militarizing against it.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [always]{.mark} had [a tricky
relationship with immigrants]{.mark} and refugees]{.underline}, [even if
part of the American mythology is that we are a land of
newcomers]{.underline}. In this mythology, they---migrants---[are a part
of us]{.underline}. [At the same time]{.underline}, [the United States
has also gone through periodic spasms of intense anti-immigrant
feeling.      ]{.underline}

[So it is [now]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with the Trump
[Administration]{.mark} [weaponizing]{.mark} the [fear of the
other]{.mark} and [promoting]{.mark} a [moral panic about
strangers]{.mark} coming to our shores]{.underline}. When these people,
including those who are also Americans, [[become seen as]{.mark} a
[threat to the nation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [they are no longer a part
of us]{.underline}. Instead[, [they become the other to our collective
self]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a country]{.underline}.

[[This is not new]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In the late 1800s]{.underline},
many Americans believed that Chinese immigrants brought disease, crime,
[and vice]{.underline}, along with an inhuman work ethic. [The result
was the burning of Chinatowns]{.underline}, [the lynching of Chinese
immigrants]{.underline}, [and the banning of most Chinese
immigration]{.underline}. With his tariffs, [President Donald
[Trump]{.mark} may be [targetting]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} even more
explicitly than [when he characterized COVID]{.mark}-19 [as]{.mark} the
["kung flu,"]{.mark} but he did campaign on sealing American borders to
protect the nation against Mexican "rapists" in 2015 and alleged
Venezuelan gangsters in 2024]{.underline}. [His promised deportation
campaign recalls the 1920s and 1930s when the government
indiscriminately rounded up roughly 1 million Mexicans and Mexican
American citizens and dispatched them to Mexico.    ]{.underline}

[[Punishing]{.mark} this [other]{.mark} [takes]{.mark} the [form of
theater and spectacle]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[meant to entertain]{.mark}
and satisfy [some]{.mark} [while silencing]{.mark} and disciplining [the
rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, [renditioning alleged Venezuelan
gangsters]{.mark} to El Salvador on flights operated by ICE is [flaunted
before cameras that record them as subhuman]{.mark}, heads shaved bald,
anonymous]{.underline}, [and humiliated in infantilizing uniforms of
white shirts and shorts]{.underline}.

[Renditioning is a more appropriate word than deportation]{.underline},
since many people are being returned not to their country of origin but
to somewhere else, [like the migrants of many nationalities who ended up
confined in a hotel and jungle camp in Panama]{.underline}.
[Renditioning also evokes the practice inflicted by the CIA on suspected
terrorists vanished into so-called black sites]{.underline}, which suits
how Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, [a wartime authority
last used to intern Japanese immigrants and Japanese American citizens
in World War II]{.underline}, [to describe alleged Venezuelan gangsters
as "terrorists" who are "infiltrating" the United States]{.underline}.
(Though, [federal judges in both New York and Texas have challenged this
action in the court system.)]{.underline}

[Presidents and [states describing alleged criminals as
terrorists]{.mark} should [frighten us]{.mark} all [because
"terrorist"]{.mark} is [a name]{.mark} of infinite flexibility [that can
be applied to anyone]{.mark} whom [the state says is subverting
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [What is worse is that a ["War on
Terror,"]{.mark} such as the one President George W]{.underline}. [Bush
declared in the wake of 9/11]{.underline}, can never be won. [It is [a
state of permanent war]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [inflicted on an unending
parade of others while]{.underline} ]{.mark}[also [enforcing domestic
conformity in a bipolar world]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Bush signaled
when he said, [["You're either with us or against
us."]{.underline}]{.mark}

[While it may be possible to win a war against a particular set of
enemies]{.underline}, [[how does one defeat terror?]{.mark} The [threat
of terror continues because]{.mark} [terror]{.mark} has [existed]{.mark}
as long as curiosity and fear]{.underline}, [love and hate]{.underline},
[light and dark]{.underline}---[[as long as the human heart has
beat]{.underline}]{.mark}. Communism, [or any other ideology the
administration in power doesn't agree with]{.underline}, might be
defeated---[but [the terrorist never can]{.mark}]{.underline}, [since
[terror]{.mark} is [an unending wellspring]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[embodied by actual threats]{.underline}]{.mark} [but also [coming from
within us and giving birth to ever-new
demons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The War on Terror might have resonated with Americans because terror
has been a part of American life since the first European settlers came
to these shores]{.underline}. [Perhaps the [first]{.mark} terrifying
[others]{.mark} [for]{.mark} these [settlers were]{.mark} the
[Indigenous]{.mark} peoples]{.underline}, [followed by the kidnapped and
enslaved Africans whose labor and bodies made the United States
possible]{.underline}. [Or perhaps the first other for the settlers was
the vast land itself]{.underline}, [promising bounty and threatening
disaster]{.underline}. That is still true today, [as [those
invested]{.mark} in fossil fuels [promise]{.mark} that the [land can be
dominated and rendered profitable]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[just as
the]{.mark} particular [others]{.mark} who worked the land]{.underline},
from enslaved people to migrant laborers, could be exploited.

[Whether it was through other humans or the land]{.underline}, [the
settlers had encountered what the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas
called the face of the Other]{.underline}, [which Levinas argued could
elicit feelings of compassion or terror]{.underline}. [These polar
opposite reactions continue to define our American political and
cultural landscape]{.underline}. As some call for empathy for others,
[the [Trump Administration]{.mark} characterizes these gestures as part
of a "diversity, equity, inclusion" ideology that must be
destroyed.]{.underline} [Whereas Levinas thought the face-to-face
encounter with one's other was a crucial ethical task]{.underline},
[Elon Musk [believes]{.mark} that the ["fundamental weakness of Western
civilization is empathy,"]{.mark} opening it up to be taken over by
non-Western and nonwhite people]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that
those sent to El Salvador's prison are paraded with their heads forcibly
bowed. We are not allowed to see their very human faces.

[It is [not simply gangsters who are terrorists]{.mark} in the
imagination that fear the other]{.underline}, [[it is refugees and
immigrants]{.underline}, [documented and
undocumented]{.underline},]{.mark} who are said to be seeking to replace
white people. [To protect themselves from the threat of
expulsion]{.underline}, migrants are expected to profess uncompromising
loyalty. [Their [difference from]{.mark} the [norms]{.mark} of the
nation]{.underline}---white, male, heterosexual, Christian---[seemingly
[precludes them from the right to dissent]{.mark} that is supposed to be
a part of Americanism]{.underline}. Thus, [all of the international
students who have so far been arrested and detained incommunicado for
protesting what they argue is Israel's genocidal attack on Gaza are
nonwhite]{.underline}, with origins in countries like Syria, Turkey,
[and South Korea. ]{.underline}

[Whether or not one agrees with their speech]{.underline}, they, too,
[have free-speech rights as permanent legal residents and international
students]{.underline}, [protected by the U]{.underline}.S. Constitution.
[But it's worth asking how much separates a citizen]{.underline},
[especially a nonwhite one or a naturalized one]{.underline}, from
Columbia-graduate Mahmoud Khalil, [who is a permanent legal
resident]{.underline}---or Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, an
international student, arrested by masked ICE officers who barely deign
to show identification or badges. An erosion of those rights can be
extended to citizens as well. [[As the line]{.mark} between arresting
and kidnapping]{.underline}, [official police and secret police, [is
blurred, we]{.mark}]{.underline}---citizen or noncitizen---[[are meant
to be intimidated]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[We are meant to submit to
power]{.mark},]{.underline} [[to any]{.mark} masked [person saying they
are]{.mark} the [law]{.mark}]{.underline}, [just as the Venezuelans
dispatched to El Salvador are meant to crouch before
menacing]{.underline}, masked, armored guards.

[Domestically]{.underline}, [the mechanisms of deportation or the state
punishing its enemies are unlikely to stop with Venezuelans or advocates
of a Palestinian state]{.underline}, [since the mechanism of power is
based on paranoia]{.underline}, [with one threat metastasizing and
expanding]{.underline}. [The Trump Administration's crusade against
pro-Palestinian students]{.underline}, for example, [is enmeshed with
its argument that it is defending Jewish people on and off
campuses]{.underline}. But this is a weaponization of antisemitism,
[turning a very real racism into a tool to advance a political agenda
whereby Palestinians become the new others]{.underline}, [temporarily
replacing Jewish people as perpetual others]{.underline}.

[Punishing assorted others quells empathy and dissent]{.underline}, for
we do not want to be targeted ourselves. [Hence the sight of those who
might be considered other turning against those already marked as
others]{.underline}, [as in the case of documented immigrants condoning
the deportation of undocumented immigrants]{.underline}.

[[This goes deeper than paranoia]{.mark} precisely because this is a
classic divide-and-conquer political strategy]{.underline}, [illustrated
by the Trump Administration methodically attacking university after
university]{.underline}, law firm after law firm, immigrant group after
immigrant group, individual after individual. [Each hopes to be spared
by the figurative firing squad]{.underline}, but predictably, none will
be. [The lesson to be learned is that we are not safer by sacrificing
others]{.underline}. [[Authoritarian power]{.mark} will [not]{.mark} be
[satisfied]{.mark} [with]{.mark} one sacrifice or one enemy or [one
other but will require more]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[since]{.mark} that
[power thrives on]{.mark} the spectacle of
[punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the rendition]{.underline}. [[Each
punishment]{.mark} further [diminishes]{.mark} the [ability of
everyone]{.mark} else [to resist]{.mark} that power]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [[the more power]{.mark} that [authoritarianism
accrues]{.mark} in its willingness to break any rule or
law]{.underline}, [[the less power there is in]{.mark} those [rules and
laws to protect us]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[The solution]{.mark} to such an approach [has always been the
same]{.mark} but bears repeating]{.underline}: [[unity is our only
hope]{.underline}]{.mark}, solidarity our primary strategy. [[We must
refuse to be divided]{.underline}]{.mark}, [even as we are offered the
temptation of sacrificing others]{.underline}, [or the bargain of giving
up one right after another in the hopes of securing safety from unending
terror]{.underline}. [We are at a moment now where Trump is pursuing the
idea of eroding]{.underline}, even ending, birthright citizenship, [with
the idea of sending "homegrown" Americans to El Salvador's
prisons]{.underline}. [His Administration is also seeking an expansion
of a for-profit immigrant detention system]{.underline}, with a budget
of \$45 billion. When do detention camps become concentration camps,
[which is what Franklin Delano Roosevelt initially called the places
where Japanese Americans were interned? At what point will enough of us
say enough? ]{.underline}

[What might destroy our society is not immigrants or refugees or
Palestinians or women seeking abortions or trans people or any of the
other assorted others that have been posited as undermining American
society]{.underline}. [[What might destroy us is our own
fear]{.underline}, [not just of the other who is a neighbor and a
stranger but also of ourselves]{.underline}]{.mark}, of that black hole
of abiding mysteries within us that so many of us cannot solve on our
own.

[What might help us overcome that fear and terror is not to banish
others but to keep company with them]{.underline}, to speak with them,
to meet them face to face.

### AT: "Russia worse"

#### Russian policies towards Arctic Indigenous people may be [imperfect]{.underline} but it does build in safeguards for [linguistic]{.underline}, [spiritual]{.underline} and [cultural preservation]{.underline} 

**Tishkov et al 2015** (Valery Alexandrovich Tishkov
academician-secretary of Department of Historical and Philological
Sciences, N. I. Novikova Doctor of History, Candidate of History E. A.

In this context, let us consider certain sociocultural realities of the
present inhabitants of the Arctic. [[Academic studies on the history and
culture of Arctic peo ples have a deep and remarkable
background]{.underline}]{.mark}, starting from the first scientific
expeditions and descriptions of the peoples living in that region. [[The
Soviet scientific school on studying Arctic peoples is especially merito
rious. Studies in this area were dedicated not only to issues of the
historical, social, and ethnocultural development of the region's
indigenous peoples but also to the search for ways of their development
by pre serving traditions]{.underline}]{.mark} and applying state
paternalism (see, for example, numerous "memos to directive agencies" by
associates of the Institute of Ethnography of the USSR Academy of
Sciences in the 1950s and 1980s \[1\]).

The socioeconomic and political processes that involve these peoples
pose new tasks before science. They include determining further
perspectives of the development of Arctic communities under the current
economic and military--strategic projects. This prob lem enjoys serious
attention throughout the world. The main point to which human society
has come is the understanding that it is necessary to reject pater
nalism with regard to "backward" peoples and to rec ognize the
originality and inherent worth of their cul tures.

Studies on the Arctic peoples have become more active of late. Within
the basic research program of the RAS Presidium, the project Indigenous
Peoples and the Industrial Development of the Arctic: Coping with Risks
and Development Strategies has been imple mented since 2014. A large
number of regional histor ical--cultural and ethnographical studies are
being conducted, and joint international projects have been implemented.

The Arctic zone of our country was determined in 2014 by Decree no. 296
of the Russian president On Land Territories of the Arctic Zone of the
Russian Federation. It includes the territories of eight constit uent
members of the Russian Federation: (1) Mur mansk oblast; (2) seven
municipal units of Arkhangel'sk oblast; (3) the Nenets Autonomous
District; (4) the urban district Vorkuta of the Komi Republic; (5) the
Yamalo--Nenets Autonomous District; (6) the urban district of Noril'sk,
the Taimyr Dolgano-- Nenets Municipal Region, and the Turukhanskii Dis
trict of Krasnoyarsk krai; (7) five uluses (districts) of the Sakha
(Yakutia) Republic; and (8) the Chukotka Autonomous District. The area
of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation is about 9 million square
kilo meters; its population is more than 2.5 million people, which is
less than 2% of Russia's population and about 40% of the population of
the entire Arctic. Out of about 250000 people of this category of the
Russian population, 82500 representatives of indigenous small nations
live in the Russian Arctic. By their ethnic composition, they are
Nenets, Chukchi, Khanty, Evens, Evenks, Selkups, Sami, Eskimos, Dolgans,
Chuvans, Kets, Nganasans, Yukaghirs, Enets, Mansi, Veps, Koryaks,
Itelmens, and Kereks (Tables 1, 2). Some of them are nomads or
seminomads, which implies traditional types of nature use, such as
reindeer husbandry, fishery, seal hunting, hunting, and foraging. The
majority are settled residents living in villages and towns. According
to our estimates, about 20000 people in the Arctic, i.e., about
onefourth of its native popula tion, migrate parttime or yearround. Note
that about 60% of the country's nomadic population falls on the
Yamalo--Nenets Autonomous District \[2\].

The demographic situation and social problems. Not long ago, our
scientists and the public rang the alarm concerning a decrease in the
population (and even the "extinction") of the Arctic indigenous peoples.
How ever, the data of recent censuses show that these fears are
exaggerated. In reality, the population of the largest Arctic groups
(Nenets, Chukchi, Khanty, and Evens) is even increasing, while the
smallest groups manage to preserve a more or less stable demographic
dynamics. In the medium term, at any rate, we do not expect any dramatic
demographic changes in this portion of the Russian population. We have
even fewer grounds to expect that a vast administrative territory will
emerge with the dominance of representatives of the Arctic groups, as
was the case, for example, in Canada, where this resulted in the
formation of a new autonomous ter ritory, Nunavut, dominated by Canadian
natives.

At the same time, very topical are social problems associated with the
organization of healthcare in remote regions of the Russian Arctic,
because access to hospitals and outpatient clinics for nomads is diffi
cult and the only means for emergency rescue is heli copter
transportation. Even general therapeutic aid is often inaccessible for
tundra nomads, to say nothing about specialized treatment. The most
pressing social problem is still alcoholism, which is one of the causes
of high mortality among northern natives, their low life expectancy, and
their social alienation.

From the point of view of ethnocultural develop ment, the Arctic Zone of
the Russian Federation shows a tendency toward a decrease in the number
of those from the local ethnic groups who can speak their native
languages, which is a consequence of centuries long contacts with
neighboring peoples and the policy of integration pursued starting from
the 1930s. With regard to small nations of the North, this tendency is
especially acute, because ethnic languages in their environment,
primarily due to their vocabulary specif ics, are a mechanism of
adapting to survival in the severe natural conditions.

Questions about languages and ethnic identity (nationality) have
invariably been present in all domestic censuses since 1920. These data
and scien tific studies show that the ethnic languages of small nations
of the North are prone to displacement by dominant languages, primarily
Russian. For example, the census of 1989 showed that language
assimilation was no less than 35% on average (such was the share of
natives who could not speak their mother tongues). The real scales of
language assimilation are even greater, because domestic censuses poorly
reveal the degree of language competence of the population owing to
incorrect formulation of the questions \[3\].

The content of Table 3 reflects the degree of the languages skills of
the indigenous small nations of the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation according to the 2010 census. We can see that only 37% of
partici pants in the census specified that they could speak the language
of their ethnic group, while 96% said that they knew Russian. Our field
materials show that the Khanty, Nenets, Selkup, Chukchi, and Eskimo lan
guages most fully preserve their positions as the main means of
communication. More than 85% of Nenetscan speak Nenets \[4, pp. 82,
83\]. Overall, the language situation described by linguists in the
1990s for the largest northern peoples persists: sustainable bilin
gualism (for example, Nenets and Russian or Chukchi and Russian) was and
is typical of it \[5, p. 162\]. Today, however, the Russian language is
the main language of knowledge and communication for the overwhelming
majority of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation.

The general situation is that practically all Arctic natives of Russia
know Russian and almost 30% of them call it their mother tongue (Table
4). However, if we view the main language of knowledge and commu
nication as the mother tongue rather than merely the language that
coincides with one's ethnicity irrespec tive of the degree to which one
knows it, the real share of representatives of the indigenous peoples of
the Arctic North for whom their mother tongue is Russian would be
noticeably higher. As for the natives' lan guages as such, the situation
is extremely heteroge neous: relatively large groups, for example, the
Khanty, Chukchi, and Nenets, who, in addition, enjoy titular
ethnoterritorial autonomy and live in areas ofrelatively compact
settlement, preserve the languages of their nationalities to a
sufficiently high extent, including teaching in these languages in
elementary school. Evenks, who are equally numerous but are scattered
over vast territories (about half of them live in China) and speak
different dialects, have preserved the Evenki language considerably
worse. Sociolinguists and professionals in enlightenment and education
contribute much to the preservation of the languages of northern
peoples. They study endangered lan guages, register and publish their
vocabularies and folklore texts, and prepare learning aids and radio and
television programs.

It is necessary to understand the socalled language transition, i.e.,
transfer to bilingualism or fully to the Russian language, as primarily
a result of individual choice and one of the strategies of modernizing
this part of the Russian population. Important in this respect is not so
much to conserve obligatorily minority languages for their fullfledged
functioning as to preserve ethnic identity and to prevent assimilation
in favor of others. According to our data, no noticeable process of this
kind is taking place in the Russian Arctic.

A considerable part of the cultural legacy of the peoples of the Russian
Arctic has survived, manifest ing itself in economic techniques,
artistic crafts, pop ular memory, spiritual culture, and folklore. This
helps to preserve ethnic selfawareness even if one has lost the
knowledge of his/her native language. Individual elements of native
cultures have become symbols--- signs characteristic of one people or
another (a Nenets with a khorei in his hands on a reindeer team, a Chuk
chi with a lasso, an Evenk riding a reindeer, a Khanty in a dugout,
etc.).

The socioeconomic situation. The activity of enter prises of the
fuel--power complex yields colossal money, part of which is used to fund
target programs on the development of indigenous small nations of the
North, to help enterprises of the agroindustrial com plex, to support
indigenous peoples\' communities, and to compensate for the losses
incurred by territorial development. Overall, this leads to growth of
the local population's wellbeing. At the same time, due to var ious
factors (natural, historical, sociocultural, and biomedical), northern
natives are in a less favorable situation compared to the inhabitants of
Russia's other regions. The Concept of the Sustainable Development of
Indigenous Small Nations of the North, Siberia, and the Far East of the
Russian Federation (2009) emphasizes that the living standards of local
rural inhabitants or nomads are largely lower than those of the average
Russian. The level of unemployment is 1.5--2 times higher than the
national average.

One of the ways to involve indigenous small nations of the North in
modern spheres of employment is to develop ecological and ethnographical
tourism and the production of souvenirs. This is associated with
presenting traditional culture; hence, such occupa tions can be regarded
as a modern trend in the tradi tional economy. To develop ethnotourism
successfully, it is necessary to create the respective infrastructure,
which is envisaged by the industry of travel business as a whole and
requires qualified professionals with higher education. Another social
problem is provision of housing for natives. It is especially topical
among nomads because the overwhelming majority of rein deer herders have
no permanent homes. Young people from reindeer herder families would
like to live in set tlements, but this desire is hindered by two serious
problems: the lack of housing and unemployment. Apropos of this, it is
necessary to account for this fac tor when regulating the herd of
domestic deer, the population of which on the Yamal Peninsula alone
exceeds 700000 head today.

Unfortunately, the industrial development of the Arctic is sometimes
destructive for the natural environ ment and the communities of natives.
The situation is aggravated by the fact that industrial activity had
begun before respective legal regulations protecting the inter ests of
indigenous peoples were adopted. Russia has not reached the necessary
parity in relations between the natives and industrial companies from
the point of view of mutual account for interests, mutually profitable
development, and risk counteraction. Our and other studies show that it
is necessary to elaborate special state requirements on the companies'
activity--- requirements that would account for the vulnerability of
Arctic nature, as well as for special rights of popula tion groups
engaged in traditional nature use.

To compare the situations in different regions of the Arctic, of
interest is the experience of the Yamalo-- Nenets Autonomous District,
which occupies a spe cial place among the regions of the North. It
concen trates unique reserves of natural minerals. At present, the
district ensures the production of 14% of liquid hydrocarbons and 85% of
gas in Russia, remaining the country's singleoption gas foothold.
Another charac teristic feature of this region is the significant share
of nomads, who preserve their traditional lifestyle, asso ciated with
reindeer husbandry. According to the 2012 data, the district had about
15000 nomads, i.e., almost 40% of all its natives. The previously
planned transfer of reindeer herders to a sedentary lifestyle and their
move to settlements have proved to be senseless; this is why the issues
of combining traditional nature use and industrial development in the
district have become especially topical of late.

The common requirement of native organizations in the Yamalo--Nenets
Autonomous District is to transfer from charity support by industrial
enterprises to establishing partnership relations and agreeing upon
issues of mutual interest. One can note that the enterprises seek ways
to mitigate the impact of indus trial development on the life activity
of the indigenous population to avoid open confrontation. To accom plish
this, they conclude agreements with the district's government and local
administrations. On the basis of such agreements, the companies transfer
money but have no effective control over its distribution and use. The
drawback of this system is that it is closed to the public, not ensuring
the target use of funds and not guaranteeing the participation of the
indigenous pop ulation in their distribution. As a result, the
efficiency of such financial injections is low.

In considering issues of interaction with industrial companies, we
should take into account that industrial development provides different
opportunities for dif ferent population groups and leads to different
conse quences. For tundra inhabitants, these are the reduc tion of
pastures and environmental pollution. Those who live in settlements
expect that the development of industry in the North will give new jobs.
If the compa nies developed infrastructure in settlements, the local
population, including the Nenets, would be more enthusiastic about
industrial projects. It is believed at the local level that a systems
approach should be applied to the development of the Yamal natural
resources, which will help build interaction between the interested
parties, such as authorities, industrial enterprises, and natives. For
this, we need social tech nologies that would account for alternative
ways of development \[6, 7\].

Today, in the Russian Arctic, the specific weight of employees in
traditional sectors reaches 18--25% only among the Nenets, Dolgans,
Chukchi, and Enets; in other ethnic groups, it does not exceed 9--13%.
Small production volumes, high transportation expenses, and the lack of
stateoftheart enterprises and tech nologies for processing raw materials
and biological resources determine the low competitiveness of tradi
tional economic activities.

The present legal and sociocultural status of indige nous small nations
of the North, Siberia, and the Far East is regulated by the Constitution
of the Russian Federation and a large number of regulatory docu ments.
In the first place, these are the federal laws On Guarantees of the
Rights of Indigenous Small Nations of the Russian Federation (1999); On
General Princi ples of the Organization of Communities of Indige nous
Small Nations of the North, Siberia, and the Far East of the Russian
Federation (2000); and On Terri tories of Traditional Nature Use of
Indigenous Small Nations of the North, Siberia, and the Far East of the
Russian Federation (2001). These laws are targeted at preserving the
historical--cultural legacy and at sup porting the languages and
cultures of the indigenous peoples, which implies developing cultural
centers and creative teams; organizing TV programs; creating doc
umentary films; publishing educational and scientific literature and
fiction; developing Internet [p[rojects in the languages of
indigenous]{.mark} small [nations of the North; conducting thematic
festivals]{.mark} and [feasts of reindeer herders, hunters, and
fishermen;]{.mark} and [holding traditional sports competitions.
]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The rights and benefits granted to indigenous]{.mark} small
[nations]{.mark} of the North [are aimed at]{.mark} ensuring their
social adaptation to the market economy and at [preserving their group
integrity.]{.mark}]{.underline} State guarantees and benefits--- social
preferences and quotas on the use of resources---often become the main
argument in choosing ethnicity by children from hybrid families in favor
of the native one. By the way, this is one of the sources of the growth
of this population category.

Noteworthy are the ethnopsychological and sym bolic peculiarities of
using nature in the Arctic zone by its indigenous inhabitants. They are
predetermined by their traditional ideas about land, and many contra
dictions concerning approaches to industrial develop ment follow from
them. Note that the native popula tion is socially heterogeneous; only
some part of it seeks to preserve the lands for managing the traditional
economy and developing traditional culture. Yet pub lic hopes for the
preservation of the unique northern nature and culture are pinned on
this group. The natives who continue their traditional economy have
conflicts with industrial companies. However, many authoritative studies
on Arctic communities show that the development of the Arctic has always
rested on partnership rather than on enmity, many sea and tun dra nomads
playing a substantial role in this. As for Northern multiculturalism, it
has historically been based on dynamic interaction between cultures and
implies a high potential of movement \[8\].

The ideas about land reflect the legal ideals of indigenous peoples of
the North, which are character ized by the sense of proportion in using
resources, the necessity to care for land, and the awareness of the
"land right" as an effective normative regulator in relations between
people. Characteristic of native nature use is also the idea that
boundaries are perme able and people are mobile and that, at the same
time, the developed space is limited. Such boundaries of a habitat,
called in the legislation the primordial living environment, are natural
and economic--cultural fea tures of the cultural landscape. Under the
present con ditions, the indigenous peoples combine the idea of
themselves as "a part of the North" and the idea that it is necessary to
coexist with strangers. To create a just system of interaction,
industrial companies should be more trustworthy with the indigenous
peoples and should include norms of traditional nature use into the
country's legal system. It seems important to create "conference venues"
where the state (the legal sys tem), industrial companies (corporate
law), and the natives (customary law) could receive not only the right
to vote but also a system of principles and mech anisms that would
ensure their interaction \[9\].

Within customary law, relations with regard to land use are of a public
character. We mean collective and individual rights, the division of the
public status of developed territories and proprietary interests, and
the inalienability of land use when land and water resources can be
transferred by succession or within a group but cannot be sold.
Indigenous inhabitants of the North perceive negatively the alienation
of land for purposes different from traditional nature use, espe cially
if reindeer pastures are destroyed. Today, the pastures are endangered
not only by the anthropo genic impact of oil and gas enterprises but
also by cli mate change. It is important to account for the opin ion of
the indigenous peoples in this respect, combin ing scientific and
traditional ideas to ensure partnership in the "production" of
knowledge, as well as for joint control over the Arctic region.

The Association of World Reindeer Herders initi ated the special EALAT
project, Climate Change and Reindeer Husbandry, which was largely
implemented in Russia. There are also other studies, but their results
are badly coordinated and poorly used in practice. Board Chair of the
Association of World Reindeer Herders M.A. Pogodaev emphasized \[10, p.
278\],

Although reindeer herders are not against economic development in
principle but do understand its necessity and inevitability, they are
becoming increasingly concerned with the growing needs of society and
the necessity to ensure the balanced development of this activity in
interconnection with the interests of traditional forms of the economic
activity of Arctic peoples and the preservation of biodiversity.

One of the ways to translate traditional knowledge can be ethnological
examination. Our working experi ence within OOO Ethnoconsulting on
Sakhalin Island and the Yamal Peninsula has shown the usefulness of
scientific review by ethnologists and anthropologists.

An important aspect of nature use for many natives of the Russian Arctic
is the idea of sacred places \[11\]. These can be nature reserves or
places of solemnization and communication with gods and spirits. Of
special importance among sacred places are cherished "points," which
connect different parts of the living space. According to the customary
law of peoples of the North, they are sacred because people constantly
(sometimes, in imagination) perform certain actions with respect to such
places to ensure the wellbeing of their families and the continuity of
their cultural space. Specialists know that such cherished places can be
identified only by ethnographical methods; in addition, people often
hate to draw the attention of strangers to them, because they are afraid
of negative consequences. These and other elements of the nonmaterial
cultural legacy of northern natives need legal protection.

The status of sacred places is not defined in the fed eral legislation,
and the required historical--cultural examination is limited to
archeological studies; it should be strengthened through ethnological
monitor ing in cooperation with indigenous peoples. Note that the sacred
places are part of the territory of traditional nature use, and, as
such, they have a legal status defined and protected at the federal
level. [[According to Articles 10 and 16 of the]{.mark} Law On
Territories of the Traditional Nature Use of Indigenous Small Nations of
the North, Siberia, and the Far East of the Russian Federation,
[historical--cultural heritage sites, includ ing houses of worship;
places of ancient settlements; ancestors' grave places; and other sites
of cultural, his torical, and religious value are singled out within the
territories of traditional nature use and should be pro
tected]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are dealing with a gap in the
legislation here, because the above law implies but does not men tion
sacred places. The main point is that no territory of traditional nature
use of federal significance has been created thus far; within regional
territories of this kind, industrial companies and the authorities often
correct their protection regime.

During ethnological reviews in the Yamalo--Nenets Autonomous District,
we encountered situations when claims by the natives were insufficient
to protect their rights to their culture and the worshipping of sacred
places \[6, 12\]. In such cases, anthropologists' work is necessary, and
it should include studies, the compila tion of expert opinions, and the
drawing of the public opinion to such issues. However, the process of
con ducting ethnological examinations is not regulated.

The most acute contradictions arise in connection with the
industrialists\' ideas about "no man's" land. We can often hear that a
company has finalized a license on a territory on which, as it turns
out, reindeer herders move. Industrialists often do not know about and
do not account for characteristic features of the nomadic life style,
and Russian laws do not require conducting an examination. Only an
obligatory ethnological examina tion can determine potential threats of
the industrial development of one territory or another.

Irrational use of resources, as well as the pollution of the forest and
tundra with household waste and a huge amount of both household and
industrial wastes, which lead to the death of reindeer, causes the
greatest antagonism on the part of the native communities. This leads to
deep stress in tundra native inhabitants, who, under such conditions,
also sometimes neglect and violate rules of behavior. There are also
cases when the behavior of "educated" oil and gas workers becomes the
model for the natives.

As for prospects for development, in the opinion of scholars and the
indigenous peoples themselves, state policy should be based not on
oneshot support but rather on a system of measures of state
protectionism and active cooperation with indigenous peoples. Nei ther
compensations, nor donations, nor sponsorship can solve the problem of
the indigenous population's sustainable development. The measures and
programs under elaboration should be targeted at creating condi tions
for the independent development of traditional economic sectors and the
culture of the indigenous population of the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federa tion. For a significant part of it, the awareness of its orig
inality and connection with its native land and people is associated
with the preservation of traditional culture.

At the same time, it is understood that, under the present conditions,
it is important for natives to estab lish a more active dialogue with
the authorities and industrial companies. Topical today is the concept
of culturally oriented modernization and multiple self development of
indigenous small nations of the North, which implies not merely "ethnic
survival" but also creating conditions for the sustainable development
of Northerners under the combination of different eco nomic activities,
including the mastering of modern professions, the establishment of
selforganization mechanisms, and state support \[13\].

[[The culture of indigenous small nations of the North is a strategic
resource of the development of the Russian economy based on knowledge,
innovation, and creativ ity]{.underline}.]{.mark} Note that the Strategy
of Developing the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and Ensuring
National Security until 2020 envisages a more active use of the
experience of indigenous small nations in practical eco nomic activity
and municipal and state management. Importantly, the integration of
ethnic culture and the development of ethno tourism and the elaboration
of original brands and urban planning (the architectural design of
Arctic cities) should support the traditional knowledge of peoples of
the North. []{.mark}

[[For the development of the Russian Arctic in the long term, it is
necessary to establish partnership rela tions between all the
participants in nature use and economic activity]{.underline}.]{.mark}
State control is also necessary; however, the activity of Northerners
themselves is equally important. Over the past two decades, they have
established authoritative organizations, have grown strong leaders, and
have achieved success in culture and in the development of crafts and
arts. However, as long as the "big economy" takes no notice of the
natives, they will have no right to participate in it and to develop
truly profitable local business. Instead, they are facing the eternal
problems associ ated with public health, education and employment for
the young, adequate support on the part of private extracting companies,
and compensations for actual and potential damage. All these problems
should be solved without delay in order not to accumulate socio cultural
risks in the development of the Arctic and in the national security
system as a whole.

### Russia worse---Arctic indigenous peoples

#### Russian [dominance]{.underline} of the Arctic is [even more]{.underline} destructive for Arctic indigenous peoples---cultural elimination and [unapologetic]{.underline} displacement.

When speaking about [[the history of the Russian state]{.mark}, we
should note the periods of certain allied (trade based) relations
[between the indigenous population and the authorities of the Russian
Empire,]{.mark} its involvement in the Russian tributary system (through
paying Yasak, i.e., fur tribute) several centuries ago, and full or
partial Christianization. [We should recall the total and rough Soviet
modernization, which included cultural revolution and partial transfer
to sedentism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as collectivization
enforcement and tough social problems of the Soviet era. [Overall, [the
policy relative to the Arctic population was subjected for a long time
to utilitarian economic interests, ideological attitudes, and
military--strategic considerations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[From [the point of view of ethnocultural development, the Arctic Zone
of the Russian Federation shows a tendency toward a decrease in the
number of those from the local ethnic groups who can speak their native
languages]{.mark}, which is a consequence of centuries long contacts
with neighboring peoples]{.underline} and the policy of integration
pursued starting from the 1930s.

[For example, [the census of 1989 showed that language assimilation was
no less than 35% on average]{.mark} (such was the share of natives who
could not speak their mother tongues). The [real scales of language
assimilation are even greater,]{.mark} because domestic censuses poorly
reveal the degree of language competence of the population owing to
incorrect formulation of the questions \[3\].]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, [the industrial development of the Arctic is sometimes
destructive for the natural environment and the communities of
natives.]{.mark} The situation is aggravated by [the fact that
industrial activity had begun before respective legal regulations
protecting the interests of indigenous peoples were
adopted.]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia has not reached the necessary
parity in relations between the natives and industrial companies from
the point of view of mutual account for interests, mutually profitable
development, and risk counteraction.

The most acute contradictions arise in connection with the
industrialists\' ideas about "no man's" land. [We can often hear that a
company has finalized a license on a territory on which, as it turns
out, reindeer herders move. [Industrialists often do not know about and
do not account for characteristic features of the nomadic lifestyle, and
Russian laws do not require conducting an examination.]{.mark} Only [an

[threats of the industrial development of one territory or

inhabitants, who, under such conditions, also sometimes neglect and

[[Since the fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1991,
[[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark} legally [[recognized 47 Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}, [though]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more than 150 groups

Indigenous activism in Russia during the more open politics of the
1990s. [[Between 1999 and 2001, the government passed]{.mark} several
[new laws ensuring Indigenous rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as
cultural autonomy and access to territories traditionally used for
hunting and pastureland. [[But Indigenous peoples remain among the most
socially and economically marginalized groups in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Socioeconomically, [[their health,
