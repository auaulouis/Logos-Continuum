### UX -- Air Incursions Increasing

#### China\'s Air Incursions causes mistrust between countries -- test of American air defense

**Pike 25**, Historian and author of Hirohito's War, The Pacific War
1941-1945 and Empires at War: A Short History of Modern Asia Since World
War II(Francis, 03/02/25, China and the strange history of balloon
warfare,
https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/china-and-the-strange-history-of-balloon-warfare/)

**[China's 'spy' balloon]{.underline}**, (or is it an errant weather
balloon?), is currently being tracked across America. Picked up [above
the Aleutian Islands]{.underline}, it was buzzed by US planes above
Montana and is now headed eastwards as it is pushed by the prevailing
Jet Stream. The Pentagon has decided not to shoot it down; it does not
want debris landing on middle America. China insists the balloon is used
for meteorological research and strayed because of bad weather. But [the
incident has prompted US]{.underline} Secretary of State Antony Blinken
[to postpone his trip to China]{.underline} that was scheduled for next
week. Was the balloon inspired by Japan's Emperor Hirohito? Starting in
November 1944 the Japanese army sent Fu-Go (Operation Fu) balloon bombs
across the Pacific from various sites along the east coast of Japan's
main island of Honshu. The idea was to start forest fires in the
northern states of America. During the five-month campaign some 9,300
Fu-go bombs were launched of which about 385 are thought to have made to
the US. They carried several 11-lb incendiaries and a 33-lb bomb. The
balloons were made of washi, the beautiful paper from mulberry bushes
that Japan still produces today albeit for more artistic purposes. The
washi strips were then glued together by Japanese high school girls and
the balloons were brought for final assembly at Ryogoku Kokugikan, the
sumo wrestling arena in Tokyo. Whatever is going on, the balloon isn't a
one off They were a pathetically inaccurate weapon. The bomb balloons
were found as far apart as North Dakota and Hawaii. One reached as far
east as Michigan. There were no reports of forest fires despite Japanese
propaganda claims. But there were casualties. Elsie Mitchell, the wife
of a preacher, was killed along with five young children when they
stumbled upon one of the balloon bombs during a picnic in Fremont
National Park in Oregon. It is thought that one of the kids kicked it.
They died instantly. However, one of the bombs did significant damage of
some strategic importance. By extraordinary luck rather than judgment
one of Hirohito's bombs landed on the power lines that fed the Hanford
Engineer Works located in Washington State. This top-secret facility,
part of the Manhattan Project, was producing the plutonium later used in
Fat Man, the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945. Fortunately
for the US -- though perhaps not Japan -- the reactors were only shut
for three days. Most popular Brendan O'Neill Glastonbury has become a
sinister festival of anti-Semitism Overall however, Hirohito's balloons
were one of those useless fantasy weapons that Japan used in desperation
to turn around its fortunes in the Pacific War. [Why, then, might
Beijing be turning to balloons in its ongoing tussle with the US?
Chinese state media is following the balloon's flight closely; 'If
balloons from other countries could really enter continental US
smoothly, or even enter the sky over certain states, it only **proves
that the US's air defence system is completely a decoration** and cannot
be trusted,]{.underline}' the paper said. Whatever is going on, the
balloon isn't a one off: **['this kind of balloon activity have been
observed previously over the past several years]{.underline}**,' the
Pentagon said[. The current Chinese projectile is the latest episode
then in the long history of balloon warfare]{.underline}. They were
first used as military signalling devices by chancellor Zhuge Liang, a
famous Han dynasty leader in the 3rd Century. He is still celebrated in
China's annual Lantern Festival. In Europe, silk balloons were used in
the wars of the French Revolution, though Napoleon did not think much of
them and disbanded the specialist balloon brigade in 1799.

### I/L -- Air Control k2 S Incursions

#### Airspace control is key to solve air incursions

[[Airspace is]{.underline}]{.mark}, on another register, increasingly
[[subject to military competition]{.underline}]{.mark}, blockades,
incursions and surveillance too; precisely [[because of the
visualities]{.underline}]{.mark} and what McCormack (2018) has called
'[[soundings']{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[forms of listening and 'making
explicit']{.underline}]{.mark} -- it (threatens to) afford. In recent
years, [[more and more]{.mark}]{.underline} politically sensitive
[[airspaces]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [been]{.mark}]{.underline} outrightly
[[prohibited from use]{.underline}]{.mark}, often unilaterally. In 2013,
China singularly announced that the sky above the East China Sea would
be designated an air defence identification zone for military purposes
(Bilal 2014). This prompted retaliatory declarations by Japan and Korea,
but also presented confusing overlaps with flight information regions
used for civilian ATM (Lee 2014). Such claims to large swaths of the
stratosphere are sometimes supported by military displays of air power,
most commonly in the form of ballistic missile launches or fighter jet
incursions into disputed (air) territories (e.g. by China across the
Taiwan median line). These are on the one hand reminders of state power
and even national identity, such as those seen at military airshows
(Rech 2015). But on the other, as Closs-Stephens (2022) has explored in
relation to witnessing a national airshow, they may also be felt far
more weakly, divisively and dissonantly.

[[Concerns for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[atmospheric and affective
geographies of air power are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [[attuned to
the 'allure' of things that fly such as the high-altitude
balloons]{.mark}, [drones and other remote sensing equipment that act
as]{.mark}]{.underline} stealthy [[monitors]{.underline}]{.mark} of
(others') airspaces, [[as]{.underline} r]{.mark}ecently [[demonstrated
by the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2023 [[US shoot-down of a Chinese 'weather'
balloon]{.mark}.]{.underline} Simultaneously, the ambiguities of
affective relations mean such events have multiple and unstable
valences, operating in what Garrett and Anderson (2018) call the
Nephosphere -- a vertical zone of experimentation and ambivalence.
Indeed, [[these missions can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[fuel
interstate mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}, hypervigilance and a
counter-politics of seeing, as exemplified in the wild-goose chase for
more (and phantom) balloons -- harking back to, or even resurrecting the
Cold War -- and the discovery of several unidentified flying phenomena.
Where the spectral traces of aerial presence have frustrated observers
and spy agencies, they also evoke wonder, joy, fear and concern among
the public. [[Geographers are]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly
[[realising the limits of the apparent control of
airspace]{.mark},]{.underline} tamed by visual and other (remote)
sensing practices in the 'affective atmospherics that accompanied the
prospect of seeing something in the sky' (McCormack, 2018: 187).

### I/L -- BMD S Air Incursions 

#### BMDs are essential for preventing adversary attacks from the high north.

Implications for the United States and NATO,\" CEPA,

1\) Arctic-specific capabilities Continued investments in
Arctic-specific hardware and [[equipment]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
[paramount]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} successfully
[[deterring]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} contestation
[[efforts]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}
regional [[encroachments]{.underline}]{.mark}. More than ever, Arctic
capabilities must respond to specific missions. NATO and allies must
define what capabilities they will require to operate in the region. As
noted above, across the NATO 7 nations critical capabilities gaps
abound, in cold weather hardware, ice-strengthened assets, ice-capable
ships with anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities,129
infrastructure suited for effective early warning threat detection
systems and air defense,130 radar coverage and aerial domain awareness,
subsea sensing, and Arctic-related logistics and resupplies, among
others. An essential part of the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} DoD Arctic
strategy's "monitor-and-respond" [[approach]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[enhance]{.underline} [US]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[critical]{.underline} [areas]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
[[domain]{.underline} [awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} and dedicated cold
weather equipment.50 [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[US]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Arctic 7 as a whole
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[low]{.underline} [starting]{.underline}
[point]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark} terms of cold weather and
ice-strengthened [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Regarding
conventional capabilities, the [[current]{.underline}
[environment]{.underline} [has]{.underline} [shown]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[need]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [increase]{.underline}]{.mark}
physical [[access]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [presence]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[region]{.underline}]{.mark} thanks to
icebreakers. Recognizing that it will not close the "icebreaker gap" on
its own, the US recently unveiled a trilateral partnership with Canada
and Finland called the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact.131
The ICE Pact will help build polar icebreakers and other surface assets
in the logic of burden sharing and comparative advantages --- although
it heavily leans on ensuring job security and retaining skills in US
shipyards. [[Another]{.underline} [paramount]{.underline}
[priority]{.underline}]{.mark} in conventional capabilities
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[continued]{.underline}
[modernization]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [North]{.underline}
[Warning]{.underline} [System]{.underline} [assets]{.underline}]{.mark}
and NORAD more widely[[. The 2023 incident with "Chinese spy
balloons"132 depicted not only the importance of NORAD for threat
identification and destruction but also how vulnerable the system was in
terms of blind spots]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially early threat
identification and wider domain awareness. NORAD modernization is slow
to materialize but essential: A [[modern]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[robust]{.underline} [air]{.underline} [defense]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [instrumental]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[keeping]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[whole]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline} [secure]{.underline}]{.mark}, and not just North
American skies. As part of North Warning System upgrades, new
over-the-horizon radars will partly solve the issue of early threat
detection and tracking. This must happen in parallel with improvements
in multilayered and multipurpose remote sensing capabilities, including
for space-based threats. Finally, the [[Arctic]{.underline}
[7]{.underline} [must]{.underline} [continue]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [invest]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[offensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[standoff]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [can]{.underline}]{.mark}
help [[counter]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n regional
military assets. This [[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} better air defense
and [[long]{.underline}]{.mark}-[[range]{.underline}
[missile]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}]{.mark} to contest Russian
ambitions of control (Bastion defense) and denial (extended anti-access
and area denial systems) beyond the AZRF. It also involves
anti-submarine warfare, mine counter-measure capabilities, and maritime
patrol aviation capabilities --- an area where NATO lacks operational
practice.133 Another important aspect is to harden Western Arctic
military infrastructure and systems against Russian cyber and
electromagnetic warfare capabilities. 2) Arctic domain awareness [[The
US and the Arctic 7 critically lack comprehensive aerial, maritime, and
situational domain awareness in the Arctic. In simple terms, the lack of
eyes and ears means gaps.]{.underline} [Yet]{.underline}
[domain]{.underline} [awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[key]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [anticipating]{.underline}
[current]{.underline} [threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and predicting
future ones in a region characterized by vast distance, complex
geography, and harsh climate. The Arctic 7 has largely acknowledged and
identified existing domain awareness gaps and the need for increased
capabilities on both sides of the launch.134 First, more situational
awareness [[capabilities]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} required
such as [[radars]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [tracking]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [forecasting]{.underline} [remote]{.underline}
[sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}. These [[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} will
also be [[instrumental]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
search-and-[[rescue]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[environmental]{.underline} [protection]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline} [climate]{.underline} [change]{.underline}
[mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark}.77 Second, [[C5ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) capabilities will [[help]{.underline}
[improve]{.underline} [comm]{.underline}]{.mark}unication, positioning,
[[and]{.underline} [navigation]{.underline} [across]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such capabilities will also be used
for civilian operations such as search and rescue. Finally, domain
awareness rests on better left-of-launch threat detection and
tracking.134 With the introduction in the US of the concept of missile
defeat,135 [[modern]{.underline}]{.mark} early
[[detection]{.underline}]{.mark} and remote sensing
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[needed]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [better]{.underline} [identify]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [target]{.underline} [adversary]{.underline}
[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} complexes before missile launch. As part of
multidomain threat detection, comprehensive domain awareness must take
place across all domains: Aerial surveillance --- notably with maritime
patrol aircraft rotations, NATO Air Policing missions in Iceland, and
the deployment of F-35 fighter jets in Norway, Greenland, and Finland136
Maritime domain awareness --- for instance, surface and subsurface
sensors for seabed warfare threat detection and Arctic underwater
listening posts Space-based assets for missile warning and observation
Cyber domain and across the electromagnetic spectrum Better domain
awareness must also happen jointly between the Arctic/NATO 7 and their
partners. Individually, the [[Arctic 7 possess highly developed
capabilities but often lack the capacity to seamlessly share data and
consequently achieve full circumpolar awareness. This will therefore
require increased intelligence sharing and interagency
cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark} Ultimately, the goal is to reach full
seabed-to-space circumpolar awareness with multidomain data fusion;
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and networks of
overlapping sensors.137

**BMD is uniquely key for detecting various types of air
incursions---Ukrainian radars prove**

**Michalski and Radomyski 21**, \*Professor at the Military University
of Aviation Safety, \*\*Faculty at the Military University of Aviation
Safety, Poland. (\*Adam Radomyski and \*\*Daniel Michalski, "A Diagnosis
of Russia's Military Capability in a Situation of an Escalation
of Hostility in Ukraine and Possible Implications for the Safety of the
Eastern NATO Flank",

The primary mission of the Air Force is protecting the airspace over
Ukraine. In peacetime, this task is executed within air patrols aimed at
air policing over the entire territory of Ukraine (603,700 km2). Combat
air patrols also prevent possible incursions into the Ukrainian airspace
along air borders (almost 7,000 km, including 5,600 km on land and 1,400
km sea borders). [A [crucial element in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[protection]{.mark} [of air borders is]{.mark}]{.underline} air
[[defense forces]{.mark}]{.underline} equipped with a variety of
[[missile systems and radar]{.underline}]{.mark}
station[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along with the Air Force, they are
[[responsible for]{.mark} the [safety]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Ukrainian [[airspace]{.underline}]{.mark}.
They are assigned to the Air Force Command. Every day, the tasks are
performed by military personnel and over 2,200 civilian employees of the
Air Force. On average, Ukrainian [[radars]{.underline}
[detect]{.underline} [and track]{.underline}]{.mark} daily over 1,000
[[aerial targets]{.underline}]{.mark}. Due to a well-organized airspace
control, the number of **[[air incursions]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[**[dropped]{.mark}**]{.underline} by **[[35%]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
compared to previous years, despite the fact that air traffic has
increased by 30%. The three commands play a crucial role in the
structure of the Air Force and Air Defense Command. They are equipped
with a definite air and missile potential. Four hundred sets of [[air
defense missile sets and radars]{.mark}]{.underline} are prepared to
[[defend]{.underline}]{.mark} the country's
[[airspace]{.underline}]{.mark}. The assets are assigned to Ukrainian
air and missile defense. Apart from the above-mentioned missile sets, we
should also bear in mind a high potential of air defense assets
available for the Land Forces. Organic air defense subunits, whose task
is to ensure an efficient and direct protection from an aerial assault,
are in their structure. TUNGUSKA, S-10, OSA, KUB mobile anti aircraft
systems and IGLA and S-2M portable anti-aircraft man-portable, short-
range, air-defense systems are in the inventory of the anti-aircraft
defense of the Land Forces. Overall, it is possible to identify [over
two hundred objects]{.underline} (areas) [associated with air defense
over]{.underline} the territory of [Ukraine]{.underline}. It is assumed
that the number includes about 135 active air defense missile sites
operating in combat duties, while 133 locations field air defense
systems, and 106 objects are so-called air defense service support
units. In Ukraine, [[early warning]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[executed by
radars]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed [around the entire
country]{.underline}. In the sites (posts), on average, there are
several types of radar stations. On the territory of Ukraine, there are
forty-one active regions of electromagnetic radiation. The basis of
airspace reconnaissance systems is a group of older radar stations from
the former Soviet Union. They are often exploited in various
configurations, which allows using the capabilities of individual radar
systems. As a result, these systems [are]{.underline} [capable
of]{.underline} practically [[monitor]{.mark}ing the entire Ukrainian
air space as well as]{.underline} a large part of [the Black Sea
and]{.underline} the [Azov Sea.]{.underline} In conclusion, it may be
stated that the active [air defense]{.underline} of Ukraine was
organized to [protect]{.underline} key industrial centers and the most
important cities ---in particular, [[geographical
regions]{.mark},]{.underline} mainly the capital city of Kiev and other
important industrial centers such as Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkov, or Odessa.
The majority of air defense posts have been scattered throughout the
entire country along the western border. It is worth emphasizing that
the whole territory of Ukraine is covered by a network of
[radar]{.underline} and electronic warfare station[s]{.underline}, and
the key regions and cities [have]{.underline} a multi layer air defense,
which ensures a [strong cover against]{.underline} possible air
[strikes]{.underline}. The Integrated Air Defense System, which was
created using all forces and assets from each branch of the armed
forces, is efficient and economic, although it requires a strict and
centralized control system. Ukrainian military commanders are aware that
[[a modern air defense system]{.underline}]{.mark} must be
multifunctional, [[able to fight]{.underline}]{.mark} not only with
airplanes and helicopters, but also with missiles and other [[unmanned
aerial vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark} (platforms). In this respect, it is
assumed that the efficiency of air defense must be fulfilled by
exploiting combat capabilities, taking into account cooperation, a
centralized system of command, and control over the operations of
aviation and missile air defense systems. Thus, the achievement of high
efficiency by Ukraine's air defense forces, with in the existing
political and military situation, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
conditions of forming [[a joint air defense system]{.underline}]{.mark},
following a coherent concept, properly divided tasks, taking into
account the properties of its own reconnaissance, weapons and command
assets.

#### The plan increases the quality of radars and sensors\-\--Making current BMDs more effective

**Weitz 15**, Senior Fellow and Director, Center for Political-Military
Analysis (Richard Weitz, Jan 5, 2015, "Avoiding Ballistic Blindness,"
https://www.hudson.org/national-security-defense/avoiding-ballistic-blindness)

Although these are important issues, [[an emergent
requirement]{.underline}]{.mark} will be to field sufficient numbers [of
[radars and]{.mark} other [sensors]{.mark} to [support]{.mark} these
ballistic missile defense ([BMD(.)]{.mark})]{.underline} systems.
Indeed, [[without adequate]{.mark} sensor [coverage to detect]{.mark}
and track missile [threats,]{.mark} [interceptors]{.mark} will be
[fly]{.mark}ing [blind and rendered useless]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
United States relies on sensors for [[such essential
roles]{.underline}]{.mark} as searching, acquiring, detecting and
tracking ballistic missiles, as well as discriminating between warheads
and decoys. In effect, [radars [play a critical role
in]{.mark}]{.underline} warning that a missile has been launched,
[[tracking and establishing the missile]{.mark}'s path, guiding the
interceptor to the warhead and [verifying its
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### I/L -- BMD S China War

#### BMD is key to stop Taiwan Invasion

**McIntyre, 6-2** Jamie 2025 American journalist best known for his
stint as CNN\'s military affairs and senior Pentagon correspondent "In
Singapore, Hegseth threatens 'devastating consequences' if China
attempts to conquer Taiwan," Washington Examiner, Available at:
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3428109/hegseth-threatens-consequences-chinaconquer-taiwan/
(Accessed: June 28, 2025).

"[Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result
in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the
world.]{.underline} There's no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China
poses is real," Hegseth said in a keynote address at the annual
Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference in Singapore on Saturday. "And
**[it could be imminent]{.underline}**. We hope not. But it certainly
could be." While Hegseth stopped short of explicitly committing the U.S.
to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion or blockade by the Chinese
military, he vowed that President Donald Trump would not allow it to
happen. [President Trump has also said that Communist China will not
invade Taiwan on his watch. "So, our goal is to prevent war, **to make
the costs too high**, and peace the only option,]{.underline}" Hegseth
said. "But if deterrence fails, and if called upon by my commander in
chief, we are prepared to do what the Department of Defense does best
--- fight and win --- decisively." 'ALLIES AND PARTNERS MUST DO THEIR
PART': Hegseth's message to Asian Pacific allies was the same as the
Trump administration's to its European allies: increase defense spending
and military capabilities. "We ask --- and indeed, we insist --- that
our allies and partners do their part on defense. Sometimes, that means
having uncomfortable and tough conversations," Hegseth said, arguing
that only a strong, united defense will deter China from acting.
"President Trump does not seek war. We do not seek to dominate or
strangle China. To encircle or provoke. We do not seek regime change,
nor will we instigate or disrespect a proud and historic culture,"
Hegseth said. At the same time[, he warned that China aims to become "a
hegemonic power" hoping "to dominate and control" the IndoPacific.
"Through its massive military buildup and growing willingness to use
military force to achieve its goals, including **grey zone tactics and
hybrid warfare**, China has demonstrated that it **wants to
fundamentally alter the region's status quo**]{.underline}." "China's
behavior towards its neighbors and the world is a wake-up call, and an
urgent one," he said. "We cannot look away, and we cannot ignore it." "I
urge all our allies and partners to seize this moment with us. Our
defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face
today. Because deterrence doesn't come on the cheap, just ask the
American taxpayer." TOUTS 'TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET': "[We are preparing
for war in order to deter war --- to achieve peace through
strength,]{.underline}" Hegseth said. "[We're equipping American
warfighters with the most advanced capabilities]{.underline} so that we
remain the strongest and most lethal fighting force in the world."
"President Trump is spending --- for the first time ever --- over \$1
trillion next year to do this. A 13% increase in American defense
spending. **[The Golden Dome for America]{.underline}**, our new
sixthgeneration fighter --- the F-47, our new stealth bomber --- the
B-21, new submarines, destroyers, hypersonics, drones, you name it**[.
It's all part of it. The best military equipment in the
world]{.underline}**."

As Biden acknowledged, by extending diplomatic recognition to Beijing in
1979, Washington had indeed accepted China's future sovereignty over
Taiwan. For the next 40 years, [presidents from both parties made public
statements opposing Taiwan's independence]{.underline}. In effect, they
conceded that the island was a Chinese province and its fate a domestic
matter (even if they opposed the People's Republic doing anything about
it in the immediate future). Nonetheless, [Biden has persisted in his
aggressive rhetoric.]{.underline} He told CBS News last September, for
instance, that he would indeed send US troops to defend Taiwan "if, in
fact, there was an unprecedented attack." Then[, in a significant break
with long-standing US policy, he added: "Taiwan makes their own
judgments about their independence.... That's their
decision."]{.underline} Within weeks, at a Communist Party Congress,
Chinese [President Xi]{.underline} Jinping [responded with a strong
personal commitment to the unification of Taiwan---**by force if
necessary.**]{.underline} "We insist on striving for the prospect of
peaceful reunification," he said, "but we will never promise to give up
the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures."
After a long burst of applause from the 2,000 party officials massed in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People, he then invoked the inevitability of
Marxian dialectical forces that would insure the victory he was
promising. "The historical wheels of national reunification and national
rejuvenation are rolling forward," he said, "and **[the complete
reunification of the motherland must be achieved]{.underline}**." As the
political philosopher Hannah Arendt once reminded us, a [sense of
historical inevitability is a dangerous ideological trigger that can
**plunge authoritarian states like China into** otherwise unthinkable
**wars** or unimaginable mass slaughter]{.underline}. War Preparations
Move Down the Chain of Command Not surprisingly, the forceful statements
of Biden and Xi have been working their way down the chain of command in
both countries. In January, a four-star US Air Force general, Mike
Minihan, sent a formal memo to his massive Air Mobility Command of 500
aircraft and 50,000 troops, ordering them to ramp up their training for
war with China. ["My gut tells me," he concluded, that "**we will fight
in 2025**]{.underline}." Instead of repudiating the general's statement,
[a Pentagon spokesman simply added, "The National Defense Strategy makes
clear that China is the pacing challenge for the Department of
Defense."]{.underline} Nor is General Minihan even the first senior
officer to have made such foreboding statements. As early as March 2021,
the head of the Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip [Davidson, warned
Congress that **China was planning to invade the island by
2027**]{.underline}: "Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions.... [And
I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next
six years]{.underline}." Unlike their American opposites, China's
service chiefs have been publicly silent on the subject, but their
aircraft have been eloquent indeed. After President Biden signed a
[defense appropriation bill last December with \$10 billion in military
aid for Taiwan]{.underline}, [an unprecedented armada of **71 Chinese
aircraft** and many more military **drones swarmed that island's air
defenses** in a single 24-hour period]{.underline}. As such tit-for-tat
escalation only increases, [Washington has matched China's aggression
with major diplomatic and military initiatives]{.underline}. Indeed, the
assistant defense secretary for the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, has
promised, ominously enough, that "2023 is likely to stand as the most
transformative year in US force posture in the region in a generation."
During a recent tour of Asian allies, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
claimed some significant strategic gains. On a stopover in Seoul, he and
his South Korean counterpart announced that **[the United States would
deploy aircraft carriers and additional jets for expanded live-fire
exercises]{.underline}**---[a distinctly escalatory move after the
curtailment of such joint operations during the Trump
years]{.underline}. Moving on to Manila, Austin revealed that the
Philippines had just granted US troops access to four more military
bases, several facing Taiwan across a narrow strait. These were needed,
he said, because "the People's Republic of China continues to advance
its illegitimate claims" in the South China Sea. China's Foreign
Ministry seemed stung by the news. After a successful diplomatic
courtship of the previous Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, that
had checked US influence while accepting the Chinese occupation of
islands in Philippine waters, Beijing could now do little more than
condemn Washington's access to those bases for "endangering regional
peace and stability." Although some Filipino nationalists objected that
an American presence might invite a nuclear attack, according to
reliable polling, 84 percent of Filipinos felt that their country should
cooperate with the United States to defend their territorial waters from
China.

Analysts and commentators often argue that [[the eruption of a Taiwan
conflict could intersect with the South China Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}
disputes[, [implicating the maritime interests and
security]{.underline}]{.mark} of Southeast Asian countries. Some suggest
that should such a spillover take place, maritime Southeast Asian
countries, especially those that have ongoing disputes with China, could
support the United States against China to protect their sovereignty and
national interests.

[[The likelihood of the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea [becoming a theater of operations]{.mark} [in a]{.mark}
[Taiwan conflict is high]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Military
actions]{.mark} [could]{.mark} well [take place]{.mark} [in the]{.mark}
[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline} if China were to
stage its operations from its bases in the Paracel Islands or Spratly
Islands, or if it attempted to seize Pratas Island or Itu Aba (Taiping
Island), currently occupied by Taiwan's forces. [[The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} [its]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark} [also might not confine their actions]{.mark} to Taiwan
and the surrounding area.]{.underline}

Nonetheless, if Beijing's most important objective vis-à-vis Southeast
Asia during a Taiwan conflict scenario were to ensure that Southeast
Asian countries stay out of hostilities, then it would be in Beijing's
interest not to conflate its military actions on Taiwan with disputes in
the South China Sea. Simply put, it would not be rational for Beijing to
use force to press its claims in the South China Sea during a Taiwan
crisis, which would only multiply the number of belligerents. Instead,
China would focus on defeating its main adversaries: the military forces
of Taiwan, the United States, and their allies.

Southeast Asian claimant states, for their part, will likely prefer to
stay out of the conflict. Public opinion surveys show that most
Southeast Asians would not support cutting economic ties with China if
it invaded Taiwan. Moreover, there would be little incentive for Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, or Vietnam to take escalatory action against China
unilaterally in the South China Sea unless China took aggressive actions
targeting them. The Philippines is likely the one major exception.

Taiwan's military installations in the South China Sea, Pratas Island
and Itu Aba, could complicate the picture and draw China to open a front
in the South China Sea. China likely would be able to attack Pratas
Island without embroiling Southeast Asian claimant states. Pratas Island
is located near to China and far away from any of the features occupied
by Southeast Asian claimant states. It is also not a disputed feature
between China and Southeast Asian claimant states. Itu Aba, however, is
surrounded by features occupied by Southeast Asian claimant states,
especially Vietnam and the Philippines. Chinese military actions against
Itu Aba could inadvertently pull these states into the conflict,
especially if China were to evict their forces and take control of these
features in the process of attacking Itu Aba. China would then find
itself creating new enemies in the course of action. The cost would be
high for China and could outweigh the military value of occupying Itu
Aba. Hence, it is more likely that China will be very careful in any
operation against Itu Aba and seek not to provoke these states in hopes
that they stay out of the fight.

[These Southeast Asian claimant states may also fear that if they do not
join the fight against China, and China later prevails over the United
States and Taiwan, they would be the next victims of Chinese
hegemony]{.underline}. As Asian security expert Drew Thompson argues,
"it would be disingenuous and delusional for those states to ignore the
precedent set by a cross-Strait conflict initiated by Beijing since they
would eventually also be subject to Chinese military coercion over their
own disputes." Based on this logic, it could be better for claimant
states to seize the opportunity afforded by a Taiwan conflict to push
back against China in the South China Sea once and for all, and seek to
ensure that the U.S.-led coalition prevailed over China. This argument
might be met with a warm reception in the Philippines, but would be
considered a risky strategy in the rest of Southeast Asia.

#### Taiwan conflict will spill to the scs\-\--leading to WW3

**[Klare 21]{.underline}**, Michael T. Klare is the five-college
professor emeritus of peace and world security studies at Hampshire
College and a senior visiting fellow at the Arms Control Association. He
is the author of 15 books. (Michael T. Klare, 12/3/2021, "War With China
in 2027?," CounterPunch,
https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/12/03/war-with-china-in-2027/)

From this circumscribed perspective, all that's holding China's leaders
back from using force to take Taiwan right now is their concern over the
PLA's inferiority in intelligentized warfare. Once that's overcome ---
in 2027, [[by the Pentagon's reckoning]{.mark} --- [nothing will stand
in]{.mark} [the way of a]{.mark} Chinese invasion or possibly [World War
III]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Under such circumstances, it's all too imaginable that Washington might
move from a stance of "strategic stability" to one of "strategic
clarity," providing Taiwan's leadership with an ironclad guarantee of
military support in the face of any future attack. While this wouldn't
alter Chinese military planning significantly --- PLA strategists
undoubtedly assume that the U.S. would intervene, pledge or not --- it
could lead to complaisance in Washington, to a conviction that Beijing
would automatically be deterred by such a guarantee (as Senator Cotton
and many others seem to think). In the process, both sides could instead
find themselves on the path to war.

And take my word for it, [[a conflict]{.mark} between them, however it
began, [could prove hard]{.mark} indeed [to confine to]{.mark} [the
immediate neighborhood of Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. In [[any]{.mark}
such [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}, the principal job of Chinese
forces would be to degrade American air and naval forces in the western
Pacific. This could end up involving the widespread use of cruise and
ballistic missiles to strike U.S. ships, as well as its bases in Japan,
South Korea, and on various Pacific islands. Similarly, the principal
job of the U.S. military would be to degrade Chinese air and naval
forces, as well as its missile-launching facilities on the mainland. The
result [[could be instant escalation]{.mark}, including relentless air
and missile attacks, possibly even the use of the most advanced
hypersonic missiles then in the U.S. and Chinese arsenals.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} [result]{.mark} [would]{.mark} undoubtedly [be]{.mark}
tens of thousands of [combat casualties on both
sides]{.mark},]{.underline} as well as the loss of major assets like
aircraft carriers and port facilities. Such a set of calamities might,
of course, prompt one side or the other to cut its losses and pull back,
if not surrender. The likelier possibility, however, would be a greater
escalation in violence, including strikes ever farther afield with ever
more powerful weaponry. Heavily populated cities could come under attack
in China, Taiwan, Japan, or possibly elsewhere, producing hundreds of
thousands of casualties.

Unless one side or the other surrendered --- and which of these two
proud nations is likely to do that? --- such a conflict would continue
to expand with each side calling for support from its allies. China
would undoubtedly turn to Russia and Iran, the U.S. to Australia, India,
and Japan. (Perhaps anticipating just such a future, the Biden
administration only recently forged a new military alliance with
Australia and the United Kingdom called AUKUS, while beefing up its
"Quad" security arrangementwith Australia, India, and Japan.)

[[In this way,]{.mark} however haltingly, [a new "world war]{.mark}"
[could emerge]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, worse yet, [could easily
escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Both]{.mark} the U.S. and China
[are]{.mark} already [working]{.mark} hard [to]{.mark} deploy hypersonic
missiles and more conventional weaponry meant to [target the other
side]{.mark}]{.underline}'s vital defense nodes, including early-warning
radars, missile batteries, and command-and-control centers, only
[[increasing the risk]{.mark} that either side could misconstrue such a
"conventional" attack as the prelude to a nuclear strike
and]{.underline}, out of desperation, [decide [to strike first]{.mark}.
[Then we're really talking about World War
III]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Today, this must seem highly speculative to most of us, but to war
planners in the Department of Defense and the Chinese Ministry of
Defense, there's nothing speculative about it. [[Pentagon officials are
convinced]{.underline}]{.mark} that China is indeed determined to ensure
Taiwan's integration with the mainland, by force if necessary, and
believe that there's a good chance they'll be called upon to help defend
the island should that occur. [As history suggests --- think of the
years leading up to World War I --- planning of [this sort can]{.mark}
[all]{.mark} [too]{.mark} [easily turn into a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Uncertainty is an important attribute of war.13 While it might be

[has]{.mark} [become]{.mark} even more [important]{.mark}.]{.underline}

per cent credibility to reassure the Europeans'.14 McGeorge Bundy has
also argued 'they \[thermonuclear weapons\] make it necessary to achieve
a kill rate very near 100 per cent. Anything less is not good enough for
safety -- only good enough, at best, [[for

concept of 'ﬁrst strike uncer-tainty' in dealing with the strategic

leaders about whether it is possible to destroy all of the victim's
nuclear weapons before it can retaliate.'16 In other words[[, 'ﬁrst
strike uncertainty' means the probability that the attacker, which
launched a ﬁrst strike, will receive the victim's nuclear
retaliation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The idea was also [used in analyzing
Sino-Soviet relations]{.underline}, although without referring to the
term explicitly. Gregory Treverton believed that'Moscow must reckon that

missiles launched in a retaliatory strike would reach Soviet
targets.'17[[First strike uncertainty is]{.mark} always [connected with

invented by McGeorge Bundy in analyzing US--Soviet strategic relations.
His assumption was that the nuclear forces of the opposing sides were

date accessed 6/27/2025, ST).

President Donald Trump left out a key detail this week when he outlined
his plans for a massive missile and air defense shield over the
continent[: He [**can't build it without Canada**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
And it's not clear America's northern neighbor wants in.
[[Canada]{.mark} would need to [play]{.mark} a [**pivotal role**
in]{.mark} Trump's signature, potentially [\$500 billion]{.mark} effort
to build the so-called [Golden Dome]{.mark},]{.underline} according to
U.S. officials and experts, with Ottawa providing radars and airspace
needed to track incoming missiles in the Arctic. And while Trump insists
the country wants to participate[, [Canadian]{.mark} leaders appear more
[tepid]{.mark}.]{.underline} "There's a lot we just don't know," said
Shuvaloy Majumdar, a Conservative member of Canada's parliament.
"There's a lot that needs to be revealed about how the economic and
security partnership with America and Canada will unfold." Trump, in his
Golden Dome announcement on Tuesday[, [dismissed]{.mark} [what]{.mark}
[Canada]{.mark} could [offer]{.mark} the project]{.underline}. "They
want to have protection also, so as usual, we help Canada," he said. Yet
whether he realizes it or not[, [Trump]{.mark} suddenly finds himself in
**[need]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an ally he has largely
forsaken]{.underline}. He has singled out **[Canada]{.mark}** for free
riding on American military might and preferential trade ties, and has
engaged in a tariff battle that has stilted relations. [Prime Minister
Mark [Carney]{.mark} has [warned]{.mark} the [United]{.mark}
[States]{.mark} [can't]{.mark} [take]{.mark} [Ottawa]{.mark} for
[granted]{.mark}]{.underline} and has [begun [searching]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [other]{.mark} security [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
shield, therefore[, gives [Canada]{.mark} some new [leverage]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the countries' tenuous [relationship]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"None of \[the Golden Dome partnership\] has been spelled out or
negotiated," Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. "[The president, because
of his rhetoric, has [alienated]{.mark} a large part of the [Canadian
population]{.mark}, and that's being reflected in the political
leaders]{.underline} ... [it's [not]{.mark}, you know, [good]{.mark} old
[Canada]{.mark}-[USA]{.mark}.]{.underline} It's like, '[We can't do this
easily, because our people are very upset.]{.underline}'"

### Solvency -- BMD Fails \-- Tech

#### Trump's Golden Dome is a waste of money and will provide zero protection from missiles 

**Dorf 2025** - Professor of Law at Cornell University Law School. He
has written hundreds of popular essays, dozens of scholarly articles,
and six books on constitutional law and related subjects.

(Michael C. Dorf, 5/28/25, "Golden Dome is the Worse Stars wars sequel
ever,"
https://verdict.justia.com/2025/05/28/golden-dome-is-the-worst-star-wars-sequel-ever6/28/2025,
ST).

In addition, even if building Golden Dome were justified to defend
against a nuclear missile attack from North Korea (or Iran or some other
rogue state), one must take account of the [impact]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[deploying]{.mark} any missile [defense]{.mark} [system]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the military [thinking]{.mark} [of]{.mark} sophisticated
[adversaries]{.mark}. [Suppose that the U.S. developed and deployed
Golden Dome but announced to the world that it was [intended]{.mark}
only [to]{.mark} [defend]{.mark} against an attack from the likes of
North Korea. [How]{.mark} [credible]{.mark} [would]{.mark} that
assurance [b]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}?

A strategic planner in Moscow or Beijing [would worry that the
[U.S]{.mark}. was [planning]{.mark} a first
[strik]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. Why? Because a missile defense
that works against an adversary with fewer than a hundred nuclear
weapons (as North Korea has) could also work against an adversary whose
nuclear launchers have been hit, disabling them before any missiles take
to the skies.

During the Cold War and even through today, the U.S. and its principal
potential adversaries (first the Soviet Union, now Russia and China) had
incentives to [build]{.mark} gigantic [stockpiles]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[nuclear]{.mark} weapons so that they would have the [capacity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [deliver]{.mark} a devastating second [strike]{.mark}: even
if a very high percentage of the stockpile was hit before launch, there
would be enough surviving missiles to inflict such heavy damage on the
first striker as to deter such a strike in the first place. However, [if
the party launching a first strike has a pretty good missile defense, it
might **[not]{.mark}** [be]{.mark} **[deterred]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
For that reason, the [period just before deployment of such a
[**m**issile]{.mark} [**d**efense]{.mark} [**s**ystem]{.mark} is
**incredibly [dangerous]{.mark}**: during that period, an adversary may
worry that if it does not launch its own first strike it will lose the
ability to credibly threaten a retaliatory strike.]{.underline}

To be sure, submarine-launched nuclear weapons are not vulnerable to a
first strike, but that might not be enough to provide Russia and China
sufficient assurance that any missile defense is not aimed at them or
that the U.S. is not contemplating a first strike. Moreover, President
[Trump has indicated that [Golden]{.mark} [Dome]{.mark} would be
[designed]{.mark} to [protect]{.mark} [against]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} from major powers]{.underline}---although it is
difficult to be certain because the only information about Golden Dome
on the White House website consists of a short video and photographs of
the Oval Office announcement.

In any event, suppose Trump were to announce unequivocally that the U.S.
intends missile defense only against rogue states. That would [not
necessarily be reassuring to Russia and China.]{.underline} Even
generally honest national leaders have been known to dissemble about
their national security goals and strategy, and [[Trump]{.mark} himself
has frequently said that he [favors]{.mark} [unpredictability]{.mark} in
the conduct of international relations]{.underline} because he believes
it gives the U.S. a strategic advantage. And beyond all of that, given
[[Trump's]{.mark} particular penchant for [lying]{.mark}, [no]{.mark}
potential [adversary]{.mark} would [take]{.mark} [anything]{.mark}
[he]{.mark} [said]{.mark} at face [value]{.mark}]{.underline}

The dream of a missile shield is noble. Other things being equal, surely
it is better to deploy a shield than a sword in self-defense. But other
things are not equal. Star Wars, even rebranded as Golden Dome, remains
science fiction. [[It is at best a **huge waste of money** and at worst
**a new danger**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Golden Dome is a piece of nostalgia and is a scam -- hasn't worked then and it won't work now

**Mecklin: **And that's going to probably be a continuing problem,
right? I mean, they're going to claim all of this is classified, aren't
they? **Cirincione:** Well, normally there's a general presentation
that'll be done, a general architecture or general plan. I mean, that's
how it's been done in the past anyway. So I would expect we'd have some
cartoons that would be released, some PowerPoint slides. But there's no
indication of when that would be. **Mecklin:** I'm presuming that the
opinion you shared with our readers a while back hasn't really changed
for you. [**So why don't you quickly recap [why]{.mark} you think this
[Golden Dome is]{.mark} a [bad]{.mark} idea for our
readers?**]{.underline} **Cirincione:** Sure**[. I think [national
missile defense is the longest-running scam]{.mark} in the history of
the Department of Defense. And what the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[has now]{.mark} done is to [revive an old, discredited
idea]{.mark},]{.underline}** pump it full of new expectations, and
market it as an instant fix to America's vulnerability to ballistic
missiles. **[This, of course, is [nonsense.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[Trump claims it's]{.mark} only going to cost [\$175 billion,
and]{.mark} it'll be all [done by the end of his term.]{.mark} Which is
[insane.]{.mark}]{.underline}** You probably won't even get the
architecture of the system settled by the end of his administration.
**[[Missile defense]{.mark} is an old idea that has been [proven not to
work,]{.mark} and it's not for lack of effort.]{.underline}** Ever since
we deployed the first missile interceptors in 1962, we have spent over
\$531 billion on various failed missile-defense schemes. **[[None have
worked.]{.mark} All we have to show for these decades of effort are 44
interceptors in Alaska and California that are so bad]{.underline}**
that the Department of Defense just awarded Lockheed Martin an \$18
billion contract to build a brand-new replacement system. **[So none of
this has worked. [Trump claims]{.mark} that Reagan didn't have the
missile-defense technology, but [we]{.mark} now [have "super]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology." That is simply [not true.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
While there have been improvements in computers and miniaturization and
lethality of kill vehicles, these are comparatively incremental
considering the challenge that a defensive system faces. **[As the
[American Physical Society
report](https://www.aps.org/publications/reports/strategic-ballistic-missile-defense)
concluded earlier this year, any [conceivable missile defense system can
be]{.mark} easily [overwhelmed]{.mark} by an enemy firing a salvo of
missiles instead of just one.]{.underline}** And by deploying
rudimentary countermeasures that can spoof the system's sensors. And if
you can't see the warhead, you can't hit it. **[So I [wouldn't expect
anything to come out of this]{.mark} program except for hundreds of
billions of dollars in contracts.]{.underline}**

### Solvency -- BMD Fails \-- TF

#### **BMD takes way too long to develop\-\--nearly 10 years**

The acquisition schedule is about one-half as long as the
Safeguard\'s\--the only other U.S.-based ballistic missile defense
system.\\3 The NMD schedule is also shorter than schedules projected for
acquisition of most other U.S. missile defense programs. For example,
the Theater High Altitude Area Defense program is currently projected to
require 13 years to reach its first unit-equipped milestone. The Patriot
[PAC-3 system is projected to take 5 years from the beginning of
engineering and manufacturing development to reach the first
unit-equipped date,]{.underline} even though it is only a modification
to an existing air defense system. The NMD acquisition schedule is also
shorter than the average time projected to acquire and field 59 other
major weapon systems that we examined.\\4 These are the programs for
which DOD had Selected Acquisition Reports in December 1996. [[These
systems are projected to take an average of just under **10 years** from
the beginning of their development until they reach an initial operating
capability date. The estimated fielding times for the 59 programs ranged
from **5 years to 19 years**.]{.underline}]{.mark}\\3 Development of
Safeguard system components began in 1963 and the system\'s single site
at Grand Forks, North Dakota, achieved full operational capability in
1975. The program was terminated in 1976. \\4 [We reviewed all of the
December 31, 1996, Selected Acquisition Reports for systems that
contained both (1) an acquisition milestone I date (approval to begin
developing a new system) or a milestone II date (approval to begin
engineering and manufacturing development) and (2) an initial operating
capability date.]{.underline} [[We]{.mark} [measured the time estimated
from either milestones I or II to the initial operating capability
date]{.mark}]{.underline} for the 59 programs that met that criteria.

### NonUX -- Squo S BMD

NATO-13 Feb. 2025-( NATO directly contributes to the security, the
prosperity, and liberty of the people of the United States and every
Ally. <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_8206.htm> "NATO
Integrated Air and Missile Defence"feb 13, 2025 [)]{.underline}

[NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence ([NATO IAMD]{.mark}) is an
[essential]{.mark} and continuous mission [in]{.mark} [peacetime, crisis
and conflict,]{.mark} safeguarding and [protecting Alliance
territory]{.mark}, [populations]{.mark} and [forces]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} any air or missile [threat or attack]{.mark}. This
mission is conducted with a 360-degree approach and tailored to address
all air and missile threats,]{.underline} [emanating from all strategic
directions, and coming from both state and non-state actors. To that
end, it [incorporates]{.mark} all measures -- such as [24/7]{.mark} air
policing and ballistic [missile defence]{.mark} -- to contribute to
deterring any air and missile threat, or to nullify or reduce their
effectiveness.]{.underline} NATO IAMD is an essential element of NATO's
deterrence and defence posture, contributing to the Alliance's
indivisible security and freedom of action, including NATO's ability to
reinforce its deployments and to provide a strategic response.
[[NATO]{.mark} Integrated Air and Missile Defence [provides]{.mark} a
[highly responsive]{.mark}, robust, time-critical and persistent
[capability]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is aimed at ensuring a desired
level of control of the air, so that the Alliance is able to conduct the
full range of its operations and missions in peacetime, crisis and
conflict. NATO IAMD is particularly crucial in the current strategic
environment, which is characterised by a significant proliferation of
various types of air and missile capabilities and their excessive use in
conflicts, as demonstrated during Russia's war of aggression against
Ukraine. In response to Russia's war against Ukraine, Allies have
deployed additional IAMD capabilities to NATO's eastern flank,
demonstrating Allied solidarity and resolve. [Allies continue to
strengthen NATO IAMD by improving its readiness, responsiveness and
integration through various initiatives, such as the implementation of
the IAMD Rotational Model across the Euro-Atlantic area,]{.underline}
with an initial focus on the eastern flank. Allies remain committed to
enhancing the effectiveness of IAMD and taking all necessary steps to
respond to the security environment NATO IAMD is implemented through the
NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence System (NATINAMDS), a network of
interconnected national and NATO systems comprised of sensors, command
and control assets, and weapons systems. NATINAMDS comes under the
authority of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). Activities
NATO Air Policing is one of the permanent peacetime missions conducted
within the framework of NATO IAMD. NATO Air Policing is a strong
demonstration of cohesion and solidarity among Allies, as countries with
fighter aircraft capabilities, both individually and in multinational
teams, help to ensure the integrity of the airspace of countries that do
not possess them. The enhancement of NATO Air Policing along NATO's
eastern flank in response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine
continues to demonstrate Allied solidarity, as well as the importance of
this mission for deterrence and reassurance of NATO Allies. NATO
Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) is a permanent mission to defend NATO's
European populations, territory and forces against the increasing threat
posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The US European Phased
Adaptive Approach (EPAA) is one of the central pillars of NATO BMD. It
includes ground- and sea-based radars and effectors provided by the
United States. Other Allies are also providing, developing and acquiring
BMD assets, which are integrated into NATO BMD. The IAMD Rotational
Model provides for regular deployments of combat aircraft and
surface-based air and missile defence systems, as well as enablers such
as sensors, to different NATO Allies. It also provides significant
training and exercise opportunities. The Rotational Model is applied
across the entirety of SACEUR's Area of Responsibility. In light of the
current security environment, it is initially focused on the Alliance's
eastern flank. Deployments of IAMD assets within this framework are a
sign of Allied solidarity and the indivisibility of Allied security.
Integration Integration is an essential requirement for NATO IAMD, as
[it provides coordination of all available air and missile defence
capabilities.]{.underline} A key prerequisite for integration is
interoperability (procedural, technical and human). Training and
exercises play a significant role in this regard. They also demonstrate
Allied resolve and can have a deterrent effect. [A key example of
integration is the NATO Air Command and Control (Air C2) systems, which
allow the Alliance to manage NATO air operations in and out of the
Euro-Atlantic area. The systems cover a theatre of operations of 81
million square kilometres (not including deployable capability) [from
the northernmost point of Norway]{.mark} to the Mediterranean Sea, and
from the easternmost point of Türkiye [to the North
Atlantic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### No Impact -- China War

#### China and the US will not go to War -- non-violent competition, allies check, de-escalation protocols 

**Nye 2023 -** Political scientist and former Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Security** **

(Joseph Nye Jr, 10/3/23, "China and America are not destined for War,"
https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/china-and-america-are-not-destined-for-war/,
date accessed 6/27/2025, ST).

Enduring rivalry' itself is a misleading term. Just think of all the
phases the [[Sino-American relationship]{.mark} has gone
through]{.underline} since the Chinese Communist Party came to power in
1949. In the 1950s, American and Chinese soldiers were killing each
other on the Korean peninsula. In the 1970s, after US President Richard
Nixon's historic visit to China, [the two countries [cooperated
closely]{.mark} to counterbalance the Soviet Union]{.underline}. In the
1990s, economic engagement increased, and the [[US supported
China]{.mark}'s entry into the **World Trade
Organization**]{.underline}. Not until after 2016 did we enter the
current phase of great-power competition, with one US official
describing China as a 'pacing threat'---meaning 'the only country that
can pose a systemic challenge' to America 'economically,
technologically, politically and militarily.'

But even if enduring **[[rivalry doesn't imply violent
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, what about a 'cold war'? If that term
refers to an intense prolonged competition, we are already in one. But
if it's a historical analogy, the comparison is inapt, and risks
misleading us about the real challenges the US faces from China. [The US
and the Soviet Union had a high level of global military
**interdependence**, but virtually no economic, social or ecological
interdependence. Today's Sino-American relationship is different in all
those dimensions.]{.underline}

For starters[, America can't decouple its trade]{.underline} and
investment completely [from China without causing enormous damage to
itself and the global economy]{.underline}. Moreover, the [[US]{.mark}
and its allies are [threatened not by]{.mark} the spread of [communist
ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}, but by a [system of economic and
political interdependence]{.underline} that both sides routinely
manipulate. Partial decoupling or 'de-risking' on security issues is
necessary, but total economic decoupling would be prohibitively costly,
and few US allies would follow suit. More countries count China rather
than the US as their leading trade partner.

Then there are the ecological aspects of [interdependence]{.mark}, which
make decoupling impossible. [No country can tackle [climate
change]{.mark}, the [pandemic threat]{.mark} or other transnational
[problems alone]{.mark}.]{.underline} For better and worse, [we are
locked in a ['cooperative rivalry' with China]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
need of a strategy that can advance contradictory objectives. The
situation is nothing like Cold War containment.

Meeting the China challenge will require an approach that leverages the
alliances and rules-based system the US created. [Allies like Japan, and
partners like India, are assets that China lacks.]{.underline} Although
the center of global economic gravity has shifted from Europe to Asia
over the past century, [[India]{.mark}, the world's most populous
country, is one of [China's longstanding rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Clichés about the 'global south' or solidarity among the BRICS (Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa) are highly misleading, because
they ignore internal rivalries within those categories[. Moreover, the
combined wealth of Western democratic allies will far exceed that of
China (plus Russia) well into this century.]{.underline}

To succeed, America's China strategy must set realistic goals. If the US
defines strategic success as transforming China into a Western
democracy, it is likely to fail. The CCP fears Western liberalization,
and [China is too big to invade]{.mark} or fundamentally change through
coercion. This reality cuts both ways: the US has domestic problems, but
they certainly don't owe anything to the attractiveness of Chinese
communism. In this important respect, [[neither China nor]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} [poses]{.mark} an existential [threat to the
other]{.mark}]{.underline}---unless they blunder into a major war.

[There is [no]{.mark} [shortage of bad ideas]{.mark} circulating [in
U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} discourse.]{.underline} On occasion,
[however, a particularly poor argument can be helpful insofar as it
reveals something noteworthy about the assumptions and ideology that
produced it.]{.underline} With an [[article]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[The]{.mark} [National Interest]{.mark} entitled "Don't Rule Out
Intervention in the Solomon Islands," Julian Spencer-[Churchill]{.mark}
[provides]{.mark} such an [example]{.mark}.]{.underline} The piece ---
[which [makes the case]{.mark} that [Australia]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [ought to consider military
intervention]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [topple]{.mark} the [government]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [Solomon Islands]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [wake]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [small nation's]{.mark} [adoption]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a

[presents]{.mark} an inartful mix of [threat inflation]{.mark}, outright
[factual]{.mark} [error]{.mark}, and [regurgitations]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[basic]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
[theory]{.mark},]{.underline} and is not particularly worth engaging
with in and of itself. Yet Spencer-[Churchill's [argument]{.mark} is
[useful]{.mark} [in]{.mark} that it [draws]{.mark} out some
[important]{.mark} [contradictions]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[strat]{.mark}egy [of]{.mark} [liberal]{.mark} [heg]{.mark}emony
[that]{.mark} [drives]{.mark} [U.S]{.mark}. [foreign]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the ["rules-based international
order"]{.mark} it [supposedly]{.mark} [upholds]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[piece [begins]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a brief [recitation]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [origins]{.mark} and importance [of
self-determination]{.mark} and state sovereignty to the international
system.]{.underline} This is [[immediately]{.mark} [followed]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} a [claim]{.mark} on [behalf]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
["coalition of democracies"]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a [right]{.mark} to
[violate]{.mark} these [principles]{.mark} [more or less at
will.]{.mark} This coalition, Spencer-[Churchill]{.mark}
[writes]{.mark}, [has]{.mark} "[legally and morally valid justifications
for intervention in a foreign country"]{.mark} [first]{.mark},
"[when]{.mark} there is a [dire security]{.mark} [threat]{.mark} that
[emerges]{.mark} [within]{.mark} its [sphere]{.mark} [of
influence]{.mark}" and second, "because liberal democracies have an
unprecedented understanding of the world population's aspirations for
human rights-based rule of law and innovation-based prosperity for
middle-income countries."]{.underline} The policies of liberal
democracies, he asserts "are moving in concert with the broader
direction of history." The citation for this last statement is a link to
a brief summary of Francis Fukuyama's "End of History." The [first
[claim]{.mark} [bears]{.mark} a [notable]{.mark} [resemblance]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [Russia's]{.mark} [justifications]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
ongoing aggressive [war]{.mark} [against Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Such [claims of "dire security threats]{.mark}" can be [asserted by
great powers with little evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} and no need for
ratification by any third party, and, as Spencer-Churchill demonstrates,
it is [[easy]{.mark} to [gin up a grave security]{.mark} [threat]{.mark}
[out]{.mark} [of developments]{.mark} that [pose no significant
danger]{.mark}.]{.underline} The second claim is even more striking. In
essence, Spencer-Churchill argues that [[all peoples self-evidently
desire liberal democratic capitalism]{.mark}, and therefore [capitalist
democracies]{.mark} [like]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[have]{.mark} a [right]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [deliver]{.mark} this system
to them [by]{.mark} [force]{.mark}, [whether]{.mark} [asked]{.mark} for
[or]{.mark} [not]{.mark}.]{.underline} This contention, of course, is
nothing new. [[It]{.mark} has [helped]{.mark} [sell]{.mark}
[numerous]{.mark} [U.S. military interventions]{.mark} [since]{.mark}
the [Second World War]{.mark} and itself is only a refinement of the
"civilizing missions" of earlier European imperialisms.]{.underline}
Yet, in a year when the United States has rallied global opposition to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the name of upholding the rules-based
international order, state sovereignty, and self-determination, the
absurdity of Spencer-Churchill's claims is shown in stark relief. In
Spencer-Churchill's formulation, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [serve]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the
[guarantors]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [rules-based international
order]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} also [enjoy]{.mark} [license]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [violate]{.mark} these [rules]{.mark} [under]{.mark}
[broad]{.mark} [circumstances]{.mark} [of]{.mark} their [own]{.mark}
[determination]{.mark}.]{.underline} While it is not often laid out so
bluntly[, this is [largely how American foreign policy has operated for
over seven decades]{.mark}. The United States points to a liberal order
as the justification for and result of its predominant military power
and global influence, and will invoke that order in the face of other
parties' abuses, but will accept no restraints on its own freedom of
action.]{.underline} This is [[well]{.mark} [demonstrated]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} [Washington's]{.mark} [habitual]{.mark} [rejection]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [international]{.mark} [treaties]{.mark} produced
[by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations system (the creation of
which, of course, was led by the U.S. itself). The [U.S]{.mark}. will
nonetheless [wield]{.mark} these [treaties]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the
[behavior]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [other]{.mark} [nations]{.mark},

### Impact Turn -- BMD Bad \-- Cost

#### USFG does not have resources for the Golden Dome.

'Golden Dome' Will Raise the Risk of Attack on US", CATO Institution,

The [[Trump administration should reconsider creating]{.mark} the
[Golden Dome.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not only would such a missile defense
system be [[costly and unlikely]{.mark} to pull off]{.underline}, but it
would also run new risks.

The first problem is that [the project appears to be [based on]{.mark}
the [idea that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can
replicate]{.mark} the [successes of]{.mark} Israel's [Iron
Dome]{.mark}]{.underline} system. The analogy is a bad one.
First[,]{.underline} the United States' territory is vast, whereas
Israel's is tiny. While Israel has to worry about shooting down missiles
over its 8,500 square miles, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
need to defend]{.mark} all nearly [3.8 million square
miles]{.mark}]{.underline} of its territory. Since each Iron Dome system
defends roughly 150 square miles, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[would need]{.mark} at least tens of [thousands of similar
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} to have a chance of defending most of
America's territory. The basic question of scale makes [Trump's claim of
the [\$175 billion price]{.mark} tag [for]{.mark} the [Golden Dome
highly dubious.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even if somehow the Trump administration could field such a massive
system so cheaply, a second problem remains: [ballistic missiles are
[much more difficult to intercept than]{.mark} the [short-range missiles
and rockets]{.mark} that Israel's [Iron Dome]{.mark} was [built to
counter.]{.mark}]{.underline} The missiles Golden Dome would be aiming
at, namely intercontinental ballistic missiles launched by peer
adversaries, travel hundreds of times faster than those targeted by
Israel's system. To make matters worse, a large number of high-end
ballistic missiles have up to 16 warheads on them. Moreover, militaries
also attach decoy warheads atop these ballistic missiles to evade
missile defenses. Even [[Israel's]{.mark} recent experience
[defending]{.mark} itself [with Iron Dome from]{.mark} a fusillade of
missiles and drones launched by [Iran]{.mark} came to
[disappoint]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite the fact [that [Iran's
missiles]{.mark} are much [easier to intercept]{.mark} than]{.underline}
those that would be launched at the United States by [Russia or
China,]{.underline} [[some of them still got
through.]{.mark}]{.underline} What makes the Trump administration think
that a system modeled on Iron Dome could stop a much larger launch of
much more highly advanced missiles -- potentially armed with nuclear
warheads -- from a country like Russia or China?

Lastly, [a missile defense system on this scale [increases]{.mark} the
[probability of preemptive strikes.]{.mark}]{.underline} For deterrence
to be most effective, each side must be made to believe it cannot win a
war. A Golden Dome [could [give]{.mark} the [United States]{.mark} the
[false belief that it can strike an enemy first and protect itself
from]{.mark} retaliatory [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same
time, America's adversaries would be conscious of America's perception
that it can strike first. They would then be tempted to take two courses
of action. First, to further improve their own missiles, an inexpensive
endeavor compared to the costs of missile defenses. [It is [easier and
cheaper to make missiles harder to target]{.mark} than it is to
effectively target them.]{.underline}

of launching nuclear weapons first. America's adversaries could well
view this first-strike option, coupled with the prospects of an
elaborate missile defense system, as dangerous**[. If the United States
can rest securely behind its Golden Dome, [what is to stop the United

#### The Trump Administrations' ambitious "Golden Dome" faces immense financial, technical, and geopolitical hurdles

**Glosserman 25, Brad Glosserman is a Senior Advisor at Pacific forum
and the author of "Peak Japan." (June 10th, 2025, "Golden Dome is a
glittering gamble -- and likely a mistake", the japan times,
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2025/06/10/world/golden-dome-gamble/)**

The physics and the math prompted Joe Cirincione, a national security
analyst, to conclude that **[[Golden Dome is]{.mark} "economically
[ruinous]{.mark}, strategically [unwise and]{.mark} technically very
[challenging, if possible]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Yeah, that's right:
**[Those space-based sensors and interceptors don't yet
exist.]{.underline}** **[Moreover, [gov]{.mark}ernment[s are developing
weapons]{.mark} systems [that defy]{.mark} the logic of the [Golden
Dome]{.mark}. China and Russia are eyeing a "Fractional Orbital
Bombardment System," or FOBS, that consists of orbiting, nuclear-armed
space-based missiles.]{.underline}** (China tested the system in 2021.)
Space based means no boost phase. Those difficulties haven't stopped
governments from protesting the plan. In a joint statement issued on May
25, **[Russia and China called [the proposal]{.mark} "[Deeply
destabilizing]{.mark} in nature," capable of "directly undermining
global strategic stability, [spurring an arms race and increasing
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** potential both among nuclear-weapon
states and in the international arena as a whole." In another important
objection, **[they said it was a "significant strengthening of the means
to conduct combat operations in space]{.underline}** \...
**[[turning]{.mark} outer [space into an environment for]{.mark} placing
[weapons]{.mark} and an arena for armed confrontation." [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea piled on, [complaining that it could "turn]{.mark} outer
[space into a potential nuclear war field]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
Pyongyang used more florid language to echo China's objection, calling
it "the height of self-righteousness (and) arrogance," and warned that
Golden Dome might spark "a global nuclear and space arms race." **[While
Golden Dome remains very speculative, the [prospect of]{.mark} an
[arms]{.mark} race [or]{.mark} a [space race is]{.mark} very
[real]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The logic of nuclear stability is simple:
Countries need sufficient nuclear forces to hold an adversary hostage.
**[As long as a government has enough weapons to survive a first strike,
it can retaliate and inflict unacceptable damage on that enemy. In
theory, that deters nuclear use. [M]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured
[d]{.mark}estruction thus [ensures peace.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Defensive weapons upend that logic. In theory, a country could launch a
first strike, then use its defenses to prevent the remaining weapons
from getting through. To prevent that, **[[a country must]{.mark} either
s[trike first or build]{.mark} lots [more weapons to ensure
survivability]{.mark}. That's the definition of an arms race, as China
and Russia warned.]{.underline}** Another area of contention is simpler:
International law, specifically the Outer Space Treaty, prevents putting
nuclear weapons in space. Golden Dome would rely on lasers, not nuclear
weapons, so technically it wouldn't violate the OST. (Meanwhile, Russia
is reportedly developing a nuclear anti-satellite weapon that would
cross the line.) **[The argument though is that [any weaponization of
space is dangerous]{.mark},]{.underline}** not only because of the
potential effects --- **[[blinding satellites]{.mark} essential to
command and control and which warn of launches [would]{.mark} likely [be
seen as an act of war]{.mark}, no matter how it's done]{.underline}**
--- **[but because it [would prove to be a slippery
slope]{.mark}.]{.underline}** (A tricky metaphor in space, but don't
think too hard about it.) Ultimately, Matthew Bunn, a Harvard scholar
whose life's work is in this field, concludes that **["the weight of
evidence points to the defenses making their host country less safe from
nuclear attack."]{.underline}** We've seen this movie before --- twice.
Not only is **[there the [nostalgia for Reagan's]{.mark} vision of an
[impenetrable shield]{.mark} --- [revealed as fantasy]{.mark} by laws of
physics]{.underline}** that remain stubbornly defiant despite progress
in technology --- **[but there is the experience of the Terminal
High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system]{.underline}** that the U.S.
deployed in South Korea against the North Korean missile threat. China
complained mightily that a system that targeted North Korea was a threat
to its own nuclear weapons, undermining its retaliatory capability and
strategic stability. It imposed sanctions against South Korea that are
reckoned to have cost between \$7.5 billion and \$15.6 billion. China
eventually relented but not before Seoul concluded that it couldn't
afford to defy Beijing like that again. And for many countries, the U.S.
was the bad guy for "forcing" the anti-missile system on Seoul. There is
a version of history in which Star Wars succeeded even without being
deployed. In this telling, the threat of the system so frightened Moscow
that it bankrupted itself trying to respond, forcing the collapse of the
Soviet Union. For all its complaints, China insists that it learned that
lesson and would never get into an arms race with the U.S., even though
its economy and that of the Soviet Union cannot be compared --- and
today, it's not clear which country is which when analogies are made.
**[[Golden Dome promises the worst]{.mark} of both experiences. The
Trump administration is preparing to invest in another pie-in-the-sky
\"scheme\"]{.underline}** (a metaphor that works this time) **[that
[will]{.mark} not only [impose huge costs]{.mark} on the U.S., [but will
earn it criticism]{.mark} for destabilizing relations with strategic
adversaries, [weaponizing space and driving a wedge between Washington
and its allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (who won't be covered by the
system). None of this is likely to have much effect, however. Sam Nunn,
the former senator who made a career working on national security,
rightly noted, in the **[[U.S. national missile defense is a theology,
not a technology.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Abstract

[While international relations has increasingly begun to recognize the
political salience of Indigenous peoples, the related field
of]{.underline} [[security studies has not]{.mark}]{.underline}
significantly [[incorporated Indigenous peoples either theoretically or
empirically.]{.underline}]{.mark} This article helps to address this gap
by comparing two Arctic Indigenous peoples -- Inuit in Canada and Sámi
in Norway -- as 'securitizing actors' within their respective states. It
examines how organizations representing Inuit and Sámi each articulate
the meaning of security in the circumpolar Arctic region. It finds that
Inuit representatives have framed environmental and social challenges as
security issues, identifying a conception of Arctic security that
emphasizes environmental protection, preservation of cultural identity,
and maintenance of Indigenous political autonomy. While there are some
similarities between the two, Sámi generally do not employ securitizing
language to discuss environmental and social issues, rarely
characterizing them as existential issues threatening their survival or
wellbeing.

Drawing on securitization theory, this article proposes three factors to
explain why [[Inuit have sought]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
construct]{.underline} [[serious challenges in the Arctic as security
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} while Sámi have not: ecological differences
between the Canadian and Norwegian Arctic regions, and resulting
differences in experience of environmental change; the relative degree
of social inclusion of Inuit and Sámi within their non-Indigenous
majority societies; and geography, particularly the proximity of Norway
to Russia, which results in a more robust conception of national
security that restricts space for alternative, non-state security
discourses. This article thus links recent developments in security
studies and international relations with key trends in Indigenous
politics, environmental change, and the geopolitics of the Arctic
region.

Introduction

The ongoing ecological, political, and social transformation of the
Arctic has, among many consequences, caused various reassessments of
what security means for the region and its inhabitants. [States have
released new Arctic foreign and security policies emphasizing sovereign
territoriality, militarized defence against conventional and
unconventional threats, and expanded natural resource
extraction]{.underline} (Heininen, 2012), but other actors articulate
alternative conceptions of (in)security in the Arctic that suggest its
meaning is contested.1 This article explores one aspect of the contested
nature of Arctic (in)security by examining the discourses of two
Indigenous peoples: Inuit in Canada and Sámi in Norway. It employs
securitization theory to compare how Inuit and Sámi representatives
define (in)security and identifies three factors to explain why Sámi
have not sought to construct environmental and social concerns as
security issues within public policy, as Inuit have. It thus applies
constructivist approaches to (in)security to the under-examined area of
Indigenous peoples in order to explain variation in different
understandings of (in)security. The article offers an indigenist
contribution to Arctic security studies by incorporating the
perspectives of the region's original inhabitants into a discourse from
which they have typically been excluded.

Section one outlines securitization theory and provides an overview of
Indigenous peoples in the Arctic. It emphasizes that Inuit and Sámi are
organized, legitimate, and empowered political actors with
constitutional and legislated standing as self-governing rights-holders
within their respective national contexts, and situates this article
within an indigenist research agenda that seeks to decolonize Arctic
security discourse. Sections two and three examine how Inuit and Sámi
leaders and organizations, respectively, have articulated (in)security.
Based on discourse analysis and primary interviews, Inuit and Sámi
identify similar understandings of (in)security that emphasize
protecting the natural environment, preserving cultural identity, and
maintaining political autonomy within settler-colonial Arctic states.
However, since Inuit have attempted to construct their priorities as
security issues within public discourse, while Sámi have not, section
four identifies three explanatory factors for Inuit attempted
securitization and Sámi non-securitization: differing degrees of
environmental change between the Canadian and Norwegian Arctic regions,
the relative inclusion of Inuit and Sámi within their respective
societies, and Norway's geographic proximity to Russia and a resulting
national security discourse that restricts space for alternative
security claims. These factors suggest that how groups articulate
(in)security reflects their distinct histories, patterns of political
and social development, and material contexts, and illuminate some of
the conditions under which securitization -- as the process through
which security threats are constructed -- may fail to occur.

Constructing (Indigenous) (in)security

Securitization and identity

(In)security is an essentially contested concept that is contextual,
ambiguous, and inherently political (Smith, 2005). One prominent
framework for explaining how (in)security is socially constructed is
s[[ecuritization]{.underline}]{.mark}, a '[[radically constructivist'
theory developed to account for the changing nature of security threats
following the Cold War.]{.underline}]{.mark} Securitization explains how
security issues are designated through the intersubjective
(re)production of certain phenomena as threatening (Buzan et al., 1998:
35). The process occurs when an actor employs (in)security grammar and
vocabulary -- security, insecurity, threat, danger, existence, survival,
etc. -- to claim that something threatens the continued existence or
wellbeing of a specific referent object. These security claims, called
securitizing moves, transform into successful securitizations only when
accepted by an authoritative audience with the power to respond to the
threat. By making a securitizing move, an actor seeks to elevate a
threat-referent relationship to the highest level of priority within a
particular political context, thus mobilizing political and material
resources to defend the specified referent object.

[[A securitizing move's likely success is structured by three
'facilitating conditions': **the use of securitizing language**, the
authority and social capital of the securitizing actor, and the features
of the threat]{.underline}]{.mark} (Buzan et al., 1998: 33). These shape
whether securitizing moves invoke an existential threat, whether actors
are heard, and which phenomena can be credibly securitized. Thus, a key
variable is identity, but there is no consensus as to which role it
plays in securitization. Initially, securitization theory incorporated
identity as a component of societal security, wherein 'the referent
object is large-scale collective identities that can function
independent of the state' (Buzan et al., 1998: 22). Subsequent analysts
theorized various relationships between identity and (in)security,
including: how identity is (re)produced through security practices and
discourses (Campbell, 1998; McSweeney, 1999); how identity constrains
what issues can be considered threatening (Hayes, 2012); and how certain
threats affect non-dominant identity groups (Hoogensen and Rottem,
2004). However, (in)security is generally recognized as a 'structured
field' characterized by unequal 'social power' that constrains some
actors' capacities to successfully securitize 'their' issues (Buzan et
al., 1998: 3; Balzacq, 2005: 190--191). The identities of securitizing
actors thus operate 'as a catalyst or gate-keeper in accepting a
particular idea as a threat' (Sjöstedt, 2013: 153). Identity is key for
understanding securitization because it contributes to what is
understood as a security issue, and how securitizing moves operate based
on relations of power and dominance that can facilitate or inhibit
securitization.

Arctic Indigenous peoples

In the Arctic, a relevant identity group for securitization analysis is
Indigenous peoples, who inhabit seven of the eight Arctic states and
comprise ten per cent of the region's four million residents. While
debates over defining indigeneity remain relevant (Corntassel, 2003;
Guenther, 2006), Arctic Indigenous peoples retain transboundary
identities and demonstrate continuity with pre-colonial patterns of
settlement and activity. Most enjoy some degree of self-government and
are represented in regional politics through the six Permanent
Participants of the Arctic Council, which Indigenous peoples helped
establish (English, 2013). Indeed, while historically marginalized
within their respective states, the political inclusion of Indigenous
peoples is a defining feature of post-Cold War Arctic order (Koivurova
and Heinämäki, 2006; Tennberg, 2010). With the exception of those in
Russia, Arctic Indigenous peoples also enjoy social benefits as citizens
of wealthy states in the Global North, including public welfare,
employment insurance, health services, and support for Indigenous
language and education; and certain rights to land use, title, and
collective ownership (Poppel, 2015).

[But despite this progress,]{.underline} [[relationships between Arctic
Indigenous peoples and governments remain structured by settler-colonial
values, institutions, and interests.]{.underline}]{.mark} Permanent
inclusion on the Arctic Council, ratification of the United Nations
Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and domestic
acknowledgement and reparation for certain historical wrongs reflect
state efforts to reconcile with Indigenous peoples, but the terms of
Indigenous political inclusion remain constrained. [[While 'the most
egregious expressions of colonialism have been discredited ... what
remained untouched are those "colonial agendas]{.underline}]{.mark}"
that have had a controlling (systemic) effect in privileging national
(white) interests at the expense of indigenous rights' (Maaka and
Fleras, 2005: 12). As discussed below, [[one manifestation of this
'colonial agenda' is the constrained ability of Indigenous peoples to
advance a conception of]{.mark}]{.underline}
(in)[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} that is distinct from those of
settler governments. In so far as (in)[[security denotes real or
perceived challenges to the survival or wellbeing of a specified group
of people, the inability to successfully securitize may have grave
implications. Though more empowered than ever before, **Arctic
Indigenous peoples lack the power to defend against the challenges they
identify as threatening their collective futures.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Indigenist Arctic (security) research

Indigeneity is constituted by social and political non-dominance
reflected in both material and ideational forms. Conditions of material
non-dominance vary, but generally include worse qualities of life,
greater governmental control, and restrictions upon Indigenous rights
and autonomy resulting from 'the demoralising effects of dispossession,
forced removals, open racism and discrimination, and destruction of
language, identity, and culture' (Maaka and Fleras, 2005: 26). Less
overt but more pernicious is the ideational non-dominance that results
from privileging settler-colonial legal and political systems while
marginalizing Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Efforts to render
Indigenous peoples legible to the colonial state required structuring
the social terrain on which Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations occurred
in a manner favourable to the colonizer, including subjecting Indigenous
knowledge, social organization, and legal orders to alien (i.e.,
settler) values, impeding their transmission to younger generations, and
later co-opting them into certain political processes (Tuhiwai Smith,
1999). The result has been widespread discrediting of the validity,
legality, and morality of Indigenous knowledges precisely because they
differ from settler-colonial and scientific rationalist modes of thought
and behaviour.

**[[Academic research has contributed to the (re)production of
Indigenous non-dominance through the explicit and implicit privileging
of settler perspectives, resulting in the erasure and denial of
Indigenous histories, epistemologies, and interests. Research pertaining
to Indigenous peoples that excludes their voices and perspectives
contributes to the 'cognitive imperialism' that has underpinned
colonization]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Battiste, 2000: xvii). Disciplines,
such as international relations and security studies, that focus
primarily on state behaviour, the international system, and interstate
interaction have taken little account of Indigenous peoples or other
sub-altern actors (Tuhiwai Smith, 1999: 35; see also Barkawi and Laffey,
2006). The omission and delegitimization of Indigenous knowledge is a
precondition for Indigenous non-dominance, particularly as it pertains
to basic decisions over how they can and should live in the modern
world. Researchers must therefore be conscious of their role in
supporting or **[[silencing the voices of Indigenous peoples and other
non-dominant groups, and of the ethical implications of writing them out
of accounts of contemporary politics.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

To this end, some scholars have advocated an '[indigenist' research
agenda that contributes to the methodological and epistemological
decolonization of academic scholarship.]{.underline} In outlining what
[indigenist research might entail]{.underline}, Linda Tuhiwai Smith
(1999: 142--153) identifies 25 [different projects that incorporate
Indigenous knowledge or knowledge production. Some -- such as claiming,
naming, or giving testimony to Indigenous experiences]{.underline} --
are unavailable to non-Indigenous researchers like myself. Others --
such as revitalizing, restoring, and returning Indigenous practices,
language, culture, or territory -- are beyond the scope of this
research. However, in providing the first comparative analysis of
Indigenous understandings of Arctic (in)security, this article reflects
three indigenist projects. It reframes how issues that Indigenous
peoples consider vital may be understood by scholars and policymakers.
In so doing, it represents the issues they have articulated as
threatening their survival and wellbeing as security issues. And by
examining Indigenous understandings of Arctic security and their absence
from the policies of circumpolar states, it helps indigenize Arctic
security discourse and extend security analysis beyond states and elite
actors.

By examining Indigenous perspectives on Arctic security, this article
complements other recent works that centre Indigenous peoples in the
foreign and security policies and praxis of settler states (Beier, 2005;
Broadhead, 2010; Crosby and Monaghan, 2012). As an academic study that
purposively incorporates Indigenous voices that have typically been
excluded from security studies, undertaken by a non-Indigenous scholar
rooted in Western social science epistemology, it reflects a hybrid
indigenist project. Examining **[[Indigenous peoples' security claims
involves analyzing them through a theoretical lens that is
non-Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but this does not entail
distorting the views of Indigenous leaders. To the contrary,
highlighting Indigenous leaders' articulations of (in)security that
emphasize social and environmental factors may contribute to
decolonization by pushing back against the dominant construction of
(in)security as military violence, territorial borders, and the national
interests of sovereign states. Decolonizing how security is understood
and enacted in the circumpolar Arctic is thus an analytical and
normative goal of this research. But decolonization

structured as military bases and manned by American and Canadian air
force personnel. There was the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line of 63
radar sites, situated approximately along the 70th parallel from
northwestern Alaska to Iceland. Forty-two of these radar sites were
located across 3,500 kilometres of the Canadian Arctic, yet flew the
American flag. Below the DEW Line, along the 55th parallel, was the
Mid-Canada Radar Line (MCRL), also known as the McGill Fence, with eight
manned and 90 unmanned stations stretching from Dawson Creek, British
Columbia, to Hopedale, Labrador. The Canadian government funded and
built the MCRL. Further below, spanning the 50th parallel, was the Pine
Tree Line, with 34 radar stations reaching from Vancouver Island to
Newfoundland. Although these three radar lines crossed Indigenous lands,
Indigenous peoples were not consulted and had no control over these
sites. In the late 1980s, Canada and the US abandoned most of these
radar lines, including their buildings, fuel tanks, barrels containing
degreasers and antifreeze, batteries, vehicles, and garbage dumps,
simply leaving them to decay and contaminate the surrounding land and
water. **[[It took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up

development of their natural resources, and take action on the climate
crisis and protect the environment. During the consultations, Inuit

security, and the preservation of Indigenous language and culture. Yet,
in an annual report released last year, federal housing advocate
Marie-Josée Houle explained that **[the majority of Inuit people are
still living in overcrowded, unsafe housing. As well, many Indigenous
people lack adequate water and sanitation as well as access to reliable
heat and energy for their homes.]{.underline}** As Houle emphasized,
"the level of distress cannot be understated." The federal government's

#### The 1ACs is a neo-colonial Security Policy that ignore indigenous rights and further colonialization the arctic 

**Gricius 22 \***a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science
at Colorado State University. (Gabriella Gricius, September 13, 2022,
"Neo-Colonial Security Policies in the Arctic", The Arctic Institute,

JuKo

Often, security policies are framed as neutral decisions that are made
for the benefit of the entire population. However, a history of
colonialism influences those policies. For whom are security policies
created? Who decides how security threats and solutions are defined and
implemented? Ignoring colonial history when thinking more seriously
about how states behave particularly in the Arctic -- is a foolhardy
approach. This brief article will look at how Arctic security policies
-- in the **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Canada, and Norway -- [[**rely
on colonial hierarchies** and power relations to reinforce a worldview
that consistently puts Western needs and conceptualizations of security
as primary.]{.underline}]{.mark} When these state-level security
policies do not consider colonialism, they miss consequences such as the
prioritization of economic and national security needs over human, the
historic ignorance of climate change as a security threat, and the lack
of current acknowledgement of food and societal insecurities.

Security policies across the United States, Canada, and Norway

In contrast to its allies Canada and Norway, the United States is very
much a late player to the Arctic security table. Most current U.S.
Arctic security policies have been published since 2019. However, [the
vast array of policies across all areas of their government points
towards a distinct focus on national state-based
security.]{.underline}^1)^ What they all have in common is an
overarching emphasis on threats coming from Russia and China -- more
broadly, nation state competition. While some documents address broader
trends such as climate change and how that is making the Arctic more
navigable -- it is discussed in the context of this competition.
In *Blue Arctic* -- the US Navy's Strategic Blueprint (2021), for
example, second paragraph of the introduction opens the document by
claiming:

"In the decades ahead, rapidly melting sea ice and increasingly
navigable Arctic waters -- a Blue Arctic -- will create new challenges
and opportunities off our northern shores. Without sustained American
naval presence and partnerships in the Arctic region, peace and
prosperity will be increasingly challenged by Russia and China, whose
interests and values differ dramatically from ours."

Thus, in many ways, this type of Arctic security approach takes bigger
questions of global geopolitical competition and focuses on the Arctic
as one theater of many. [What is easy to miss without considering the
role that colonial thinking plays in these policies is that [the
American approach to the Arctic is founded on ideas of state security
rather than the security of individuals.]{.mark}]{.underline} There is
hardly any mention of increasing food insecurity of Americans in Alaska
throughout these documents, nor do the documents touch on questions of
permafrost^2)^ and infrastructure concerns. However, the United States
is certainly not alone in this privileging of Western conceptions of
security.

Canada takes a very different approach to Arctic security, although in
some ways quite like the United States. In 2010, for example, Canada's
Arctic Foreign Policy adopted a traditional sovereignty approach that
focused on protecting their borders. However, after much negotiation and
collaboration, the Trudeau government established the Arctic and
Northern Policy Framework in 2019.^3)^ This framework takes a much
different approach to security. Rather than the traditional state-based
security of the United States, the framework more broadly defines
security as including, for example, access to health, energy, and
education, with statements such as "Canadian leadership will be advanced
bilaterally and in multilateral forums in order to promote Canadian
values and interests such as human and environmental security" with
large portions of the document dedicated to food and energy security.

It additionally includes statements touching on the longstanding impacts
of colonialism in the Arctic and climate change as a serious national
security threat. However, according to commentators, the framework --
while it may use the right language -- doesn't fundamentally change how
Canada acts in the Arctic in terms to its security. According to Rob
Huebert, for example, the Trudeau policy is "nothing new."^4)^ In
similar fashion to the United States, security is thought of in this
policy as something that is obtained for the state and individual
security is framed through achieving economic safety rather than through
prioritizing the security of Indigenous or local values and needs.

Norway has a relatively similar approach to Canada when it comes to its
Arctic Policy, published in 2021.^5)^ There is a focus on cooperation
and climate change as the two main pillars through which the Norwegian
government frames its security, with the document opening with the two
sentences: "Norway's Arctic policy revolves around security, stability,
and interest-based international cooperation. For us, foreign and
domestic policy converge in the Arctic." Rather than looking at it
through a lens of geopolitical competition, much of the policy focuses
on domestic issues such as economic growth, future-oriented jobs, and
the societal security of Indigenous communities such as the Sami.
However, it does recognize Russia's military buildup in the region and
points to NATO as one key for maintaining security. What some Indigenous
commentators note, regardless, is that in using Western ideas of
security and progress, Norway may promote ideas of green
colonialism.^6)^ Green colonialism is defined as programs that promote
'green' development but that often comes at the expense of people living
in areas, for example, that see massive construction of wind farms. In
Norway, for example, the Sami have protested against wind farm
development^7)^ because it not only infringes on their territory but
also threatens their livelihood because it disturbs reindeer populations
that they rely on for food and societal security.

**What that misses**

[When these [state-level security policies aren't put into the broader
context of colonialism,]{.mark} any type of analysis misses the type of
consequences that such policies have on residential, [particularly
Indigenous, Arctic residents.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, [[the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} and Canadian [[Arctic security policies have
often prioritized economic and national security needs over the needs of
people, **putting Arctic residents at harm**]{.underline}]{.mark} --
making a conscious decision to put the needs of the economy over the
needs of people. Residential schools across Canada and in Alaska were
[[often rationalized by claiming that Indigenous youth would suffer from
a lack of economic prosperity unless they were helped by Western
society. The implication relies heavily on the idea that Western
economic ideas of security were more important than the needs of
Indigenous children to grow up with their cultures and families. It also
had the dual impact of forcing these children to assimilate -- many
times violently -- into Western culture.]{.underline}]{.mark}

More broadly, past security strategies from national governments have
often ignored the role of climate change as a security threat. Instead,
these policies have focused on national state-level security issues such
as interstate conflict or transnational threats that originate from
terrorism. While these decisions have been framed as neutral and the
best-suited for the times, they are certainly not neutral. Patterns of
thinking from colonialism, particularly the idea that humanity can and
should conquer nature, has led to a way of thinking that deprioritizes
the environment as a source of any security concerns. Today that is
changing -- with many governments addressing climate change as an
existential threat in the Arctic, However, even with this
acknowledgement, the only solutions that are proposed are technocratic
and solely reinforce neoliberalism rather than a more ecological
approach to security. Moreover, none recognize the role that colonialism
itself has had in exacerbating climate change as a phenomenon.

On a local level, and where the influence of colonialism is the most
insidious is how national security policies focus on questions of state,
economic and in some cases climate, security but ignore local-level
insecurities such as food insecurity and societal insecurity. This is
notable across the U.S. security documents as there is clear evidence
that climate change is having consequential impacts on Indigenous
communities' ability to find their traditional sources of food, and
their ability to maintain their societal resiliency. Melting permafrost
is even forcing some communities to move their entire towns inland in
what is known as managed retreat.^8)^ [Choosing what to prioritize in a
security document is by no means neutral, and by leaving out questions
of these local-level existential security threats instead to focus on
the threat of Russia and China, these policies often imply what they
find important.]{.underline}

Thus, [a history of]{.underline} [[colonialism matters when considering
questions of security in the Arctic today,]{.mark} both in the policies
that are made by states as well as the types of security that are
conceptualized and prioritized. [Their legacies influence how security
policy is formulated, what priorities are focused on, and what
populations matter. Rather than considering these policies and
approaches to Arctic security as neutral, we should instead think about
them within the broader historical context and acknowledge how deeply
rooted they are in colonial legacies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The development of the artic is part of the neo-extractivist colonialist mindset

Colonialisms and the New Ones: The Arctic Resource Boom as a New Wave of

Old colonialisms and the new: legacies, continuities and further issues

While contemporary projects of economic development in the Arctic have
reached new scales and exploit new resource frontiers, they are closely
related to the continuity of 'old' Arctic colonialisms. In their
development, [[the perpetuation of the settler-colonial logic of
capitalist economic development coupled with reasons of the
Euro-American polities that claim the Arctic as part of their territory
constitute the basis of 'Arctic geopolitics'.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Another new element is the growing importance of the Arctic as a
geopolitical hotspot in world politics. While economic reasons are an
important driver for territorial reorganizations in the Arctic, national
security and defence issues also play an important part in such
processes. The reorganization of military structures and the
redefinition of military strategies and objectives in the Arctic -- seen
in Russia, in the US and Canada, encompassing all of the Inuit homeland
-- points to a tendency of increased control being exercised over
hyperborean spaces by States.

[[The emergence of neo-extractivist]{.mark} capitalist
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}^21)^ [[might be the defining feature
of emerging Arctic colonialisms.]{.mark} Neo-extractivist capital
accumulation is characterized by pressure over natural resources and the
demand for greater capitalist control over space, reinforcing a
relationship between humanity and nature based on the economic value of
land and natural resources. [While colonial projects attempt to recast
themselves as necessary in the face of external threats or as the
reasonable way of seizing the Arctic resource boom, their objectives are
similar to those of old colonialisms]{.mark}]{.underline}: subsume
indigenous territories and subjectivities under [[the logic of
capitalist accumulation and extending State (and capital) control over
the populations that inhabit them. It is possible to note that, if their
scale and methods are somehow different from eighteenth and nineteenth
century colonialisms, they still represent a continuity of the colonial
project.]{.underline}]{.mark} Moreover, the [[long history of the
nefarious impacts of colonialism and the deep disarticulation it brought
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the Inuit [[peoples allowed the erasure of
indigenous presences and the emergence of 'empty Arctic' narratives --
used by both neo-extractivist capitalism and the national-territorial
State in legitimizing the rationale behind such
projects.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Another important aspect of the colonial project]{.underline} in Inuit
Nunaat (and, in fact, in many other colonized regions), brilliantly
explored in Demuth's work, is [the remodelling of the relation between
humanity and nature in colonized spaces. Be it with land, the sea, sea
ice or animals, capitalism as a mode of production, and neo-extractivism
as a path of economic development under such system, demand the
construction of an instrumental relation to these non-human elements of
the environment.]{.underline} This understanding entails a relation
between human and non-human nature developed under the mediation of
value and valorisation -- the main goals of capital accumulation and
economic activity under capitalist relations of production. This
forecloses a range of different social practices, seen as something to
be moulded under the logic and temporality of (capitalist) economic
practices. While Demuth discusses how Beringian cultures in general did
not have stark distinctions between humanity and non-humanity, Shadian,
on the other hand, highlights how such relations, among the Inuit are
expressed through the concept of *inua*. Rather than seeing man as a
separate of and dominating nature, Inuit populations understood
themselves not only as part of nature, but also as being stewards of the
non-human nature and of their homelands and home-environments.

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices; this is not the only
history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact [[Indigenous peoples in
the Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of resistance to and
struggle against colonialism.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Inuit Circumpolar
Council is an institution born of such efforts and, to this day, it
disputes the contents and objectives of Arctic policies through the
development of its own political instruments and Arctic policies in many
dimensions. Rejecting the acritical acceptance of policies based on
settler-colonial understandings of Arctic geopolitics and economic
development, the ICC articulates understandings of autonomy,
self-government and economic development other than those deployed by
settler-colonial, capitalist, westphalian States.

[Understanding colonialisms and their development is an important step
in reckoning with the colonial violence underlying present-day
rationales for dealing with geopolitical and economic issues in the
Arctic. It is important to know and tell the histories of struggle and
resistance to colonialism, but [it is]{.mark} also [important to
understand how the understandings deployed by indigenous populations and
their social and political practice might inform future debates on
Arctic geopolitics and economic development.]{.mark} While such
struggles put in question the Euro-American definitions of economic
development, sovereignty and self-government, they were also invested in
the construction of alternative understandings and alternative social
practices. [Unearthing such understandings and their impact over
present-day Arctic Indigenous policies, as well as understanding how
they can articulate alternative visions of Arctic economic development
is an urgent task.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Arctic "empty, but full"]{.underline}]{.mark}

Natural resource endowment has contributed to constructing the Arctic
region as a resource base. Resource colonialism, understood as
economically driven discourses, programs, and policies promoting
extractive activity on the periphery backed up by administrative,
political and/or financial centers,^4)^ discursively turns the Arctic
into a space "empty, but full".^5)^ **[[Scarcity of local population has
resulted in an image of the Arctic as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** terra
nullius, a **[[people-less space that can be
explored]{.underline}]{.mark}** and conquered. Over the past four
centuries, populations of marine mammals, deposits of coal, minerals,
oil, and gas have been interpreted by explorers as "Arctic riches" and
exported as valuable commodities to distant consumer markets. From whale
oil to offshore drilling, the patterns of material production in the
Arctic corresponded to international energy flows, embedding the history
of Arctic exploration within the context of human's ever growing energy
needs.

The forces driving the incorporation of the Arctic into the global
energy landscape came from outside the region. In the eighteenth
century, Europeans hunted Arctic whales, walruses and seals for their
fur, blubber, skin, and meat so extensively, that "from 1669 to 1800,
86,644 whales were killed by English, Dutch, and German whalers in the
seas around Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen", bringing the population of
bowhead whales in the North Atlantic to the verge of extinction within
two centuries.^6)^ Now in the twenty-first century, Russia has been
pushing forward risky Arctic oil and gas drilling projects to boost its
falling production.^7)^ Over the centuries, [[Arctic colonialism has
changed its shape, but it still strongly influences the design of Arctic
policies, as well as sustains the asymmetrical power relations between
the Arctic as an extractive frontier and the centers of consumption
located thousands miles away.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Fragile Arctic

Environmental discourses on the Arctic highlight both local and global
implications of Arctic climate change -- based on decades of scientific
research. And this is what scientists predict: At the local level,
extreme weather events, storms, strong winds, are likely to
increase.^8)^ The changing weather patterns will most likely constitute
serious obstacles to economic activity in the Arctic, as well as
negatively affect indigenous communities.^9)^ Since traditional
lifestyles pursued by many Arctic indigenous peoples depends on reindeer
herding, tensions are likely to arise when pasture areas will shrink due
to soil degradation. The movement of sea ice will be less predictable
making maritime navigation more hazardous.^10)^ Increase in
precipitation combined with warming will lead to desertification, add
freshwater to the ocean, and potentially affect ocean currents in the
North Atlantic.^11)^ Coastal infrastructure will be challenged by
increasing storms and rising sea levels. Thawing ground will disrupt
transportation and infrastructure by damaging railway lines, airport
runways, oil and gas pipelines, as well as buildings.

In the interdependent global climate system, Arctic changes are likely
to have detrimental effects upon the rest of the world. Methane release
from the Arctic Ocean and tundra could turn into one of the largest
contributors of GHG at a global scale.^12)^ This means that steadily
increasing deglaciation will lead to an even greater increase in global
temperature, as atmospheric methane release from seas and soils in the
Arctic grows due to ice melting and permafrost thawing. The Earth's
surface will be warming more and more as Arctic snow and ice melt, since
the amount of the sun's energy reflected back to space will decrease.
The melting of glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet is predicted to
contribute significantly (up to 90 cm) to global sea level rise until
the end of the 21st century.^13)^

Climate change will also affect biodiversity, which is important to the
functioning of the global climate system, as habitats will be shrinking
for polar bears, seals, walrus, and other ice-dependent animals.
Shrinking habitats will also put at risk migratory species, such as
birds and fish.^14)^ Due to all these reasons environmentalists are
utterly concerned about the state of the Arctic, campaigning for turning
the waters around the North Pole into a protected
sanctuary.^15)^ Through a series of public campaigns, including the
'Arctic Sunrise' protest action organized by Greenpeace in 2013 against
Arctic drilling at the Prirazlomnaya platform in the Kara Sea, activists
attempt to draw media attention to the controversies related to Arctic
hydrocarbon exploration, and to present the consumers of fossil fuels
with an understanding of the social and environmental impacts of Arctic
energy utilization.

Where the two Arctics meet

Over the past 30 years, the September ice cover has declined by more
than 30 percent. Satellite data shows that snow cover over land in the
Arctic has decreased, and glaciers above the Arctic Circle are
retreating. Thawing permafrost, receding ice caps and glaciers, as well
as melting sea ice constitute a global threat. Yet, the threat has been
turned into a bold promise: earlier unavailable deposits of oil and gas
located in the Arctic shelf can soon become accessible for commercial
exploitation. Energy companies backed by the official rhetoric of the
Arctic states largely adopted the "bringing civilization" approach that
maintains energy development and associated infrastructure as a proxy
for increasing social well-being in remote communities. Thereby,
resource colonialism manifests not only through extending extractive
frontiers, but also through interpreting industrialization as a form of
development that benefits the extractive communities by resolving
economic underdevelopment.

Placed at the heart of climate debates, the Arctic has little to offer
to the global energy transition apart from "remaining untouched." With
the increasing salience of climate issues in global energy governance,
Arctic hydrocarbons cannot be considered solely as a source of useful
carbon energy, but must be seen also as a source of carbon pollution.
Disconnecting the Arctic from global energy flows, however, goes against
the [[dominant colonial logic]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[promoted
Arctic exploration for the past four centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Turning the Arctic into a global sanctuary is also not a flawless plan,
as it ignores the fact that the Arctic is home to four million people
who want to preserve their traditional lifestyle while enjoying the
latest advances of technology.
