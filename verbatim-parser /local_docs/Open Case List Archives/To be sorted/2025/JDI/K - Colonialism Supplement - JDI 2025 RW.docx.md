[Whiteness is remarkable in its ability to render itself
invisible]{.underline} to those who possess and benefit from it. Many,
if not most, of the (often liberal humanitarian) authors of '[end of the
world' discourses]{.underline} seem unaware of its integral influence on
their thinking, and would almost certainly be horrified at the thought
of their work [entrenching racialized injustices]{.underline}. We are
not suggesting that these authors espouse explicit, intentional and/or
extreme racist ideals, on which much public discussion by white people
of racism tends to focus.7 Nor do we wish to homogenize or present as
equivalent all of the viewpoints discussed in this paper, which display
a range of expressions of whiteness and levels of awareness thereof.8 On
the contrary, we work to center broad, everyday, [structural ways in
which underlying logics of whiteness and white supremacy frame and
permeate mainstream paradigms and discourses]{.underline}, including
those identified as liberal, humanitarian, or progressive. Even amongst
white people who consciously and explicitly disavow racism,
[unconscious, habitual, normalized, structurally-embedded assumptions
circulate, and are reproduced in ways that perpetuate race9 as a global
power structure]{.underline}. This includes one of the authors of this
paper (Mitchell), who, as a white settler,10 continues to benefit from
and participate -- and thus 'invest'11 -- in structures of whiteness,
and therefore has a continual responsibility to confront them (although
total divestment is not possible).12

The 'habits' of racism13 are reflected strongly in the way that
contemporary 'end of the world' narratives frame their protagonists:
those attributed with meaningful agency and ethical status in the face
of global threats; those whose survival or flourishing is prioritized or
treated as a bottom line when tradeoffs are imagined and planned; and,
crucially, those deemed capable of and entitled to 'save the world' and
determine its future. This is expressed in several key features of the
genre, including its domination by white thinkers; the forms of
subjectivity and agency it embraces; and the ways it contrasts its
subjects against BIPOC communities.

First, contributors to fast-growing [fields like the study of
'existential risk' or 'global catastrophic risk' are overwhelmingly
white]{.underline}. As we will see, almost all of the authors identified
by the literature review on which this paper is based, and certainly the
most influential thinkers in the field, are white. For example, the
seminal collection Global Existential Risk,14 which claims to offer a
comprehensive snapshot of this field, is edited by two white male
Europeans (Nick Bostrom and Milan Circovic) and authored by an almost
entirely white (and all-male) group of scholars. Likewise, the most
senior positions within influential think tanks promoting [the study of
'existential risk]{.underline}', such as the Future of Humanity
Institute, the Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential Risk and
Humanprogress.org, are [dominated by white men]{.underline}, with few
exceptions.15 Another expression of this [tendency toward epistemic
whiteness is found in the habit, prominent amongst white academics, of
citing all or mostly-white scholars, which entrenches a politics of
citation16 that privileges whiteness]{.underline} and acknowledges only
some intersectionalities as relevant.17 As mentioned above, Mitchell's
(2017)18 work offers an example of this tendency: while it engages
critical, feminist, and queer post-apocalyptic visions written by white
authors, it does not center BIPOC perspectives or knowledge systems.

These examples do not simply raise issues of numerical representation,
nor can whiteness necessarily be dismantled simply by altering these
ratios. More importantly, all-white or majority white spaces create
epistemes in which most contributors share cultural backgrounds,
assumptions, and biases that are rarely challenged by alternative
worldviews, knowledge systems or registers of experience. In such
epistemes the perceived boundaries of 'human thought' are often elided
with those of Euro-centric knowledge. For example, influential American
settler journalist David Wallace-Wells19 contends that there exists no
framework for grasping climate change besides 'mythology and theology'.
In so doing, he ignores centuries of ongoing, systematic observation and
explicit articulations of concern by BIPOC knowledge keepers about
climactic change. The bracketing of BIPOC knowledges not only severely
limits the rigor of discourses on global crises, but also, as bi-racial
organizer and thinker adrienne maree brown20 argues, it produces
distorted outcomes. For instance, it smuggles normative judgments that
'turn Brown bombers into terrorists and white bombers into mentally ill
victims' into apparently 'objective' claims. Similarly, the influential
work of Black American criminologist Ruth Wilson Gilmore21 demonstrates
how white imaginaries of the threat posed by BIPOC bodies has produced
the massive global penal complex and the radically unequal distribution
of life chances. In short, imaginaries create worlds, so it matters
greatly whose are privileged, and whose are excluded.

Further, emerging [narratives of the 'end of the world' **explicitly
center** figures of whiteness as their protagonists]{.underline} -- [as
the survivors of apocalypse, the subjects capable of saving the world
from it, and as those **most threatened**]{.underline}. In these
discourses, '[survivors' are framed as saviors able to protect and/or
regenerate and even improve Western forms of governance and social
order]{.underline} [by]{.underline} leveraging resilience, [scientific
prowess, and technological genius]{.underline}. For example, the cover
of American settler scientists Tony Barnosky and Elizabeth Hadley's book
Tipping Points for Planet Earth features a stylized male 'human' whom
they identify as former California governor Jerry Brown (a powerful
white settler politician) holding the earth back from rolling over a
cliff.22 Similarly, presenting a [thought experiment about the planet's
future]{.underline}, Homer-Dixon23 asks his readers to imagine 'an
average male -- call him John' (in fact, the most popular male name
globally at the time of writing was Mohammed). This is followed by
images of a Caucasian male dressed in safari or hiking gear -- both
emblematic of symbols colonial conquest24 -- tasked with choosing from
two forks on a path, as [imagined]{.underline} by white American poet
Robert Frost. This [image of rugged masculine whiteness, embodied in
physical strength, colonial prowess, and the ability to dominate
difficult landscapes]{.underline} is mirrored in his framing of his
former co-workers on oil rigs in the Canadian prairies25 as models of
resilience. Similarly, [American settler science]{.underline} writer
Annalee Newitz26 proposes the Canadian province of Saskatchewan as a
'[model for human survival']{.underline}, based on her perceptions of
the resilience, persistence and collaborative frontier attitudes of its
people. Saskatchewan is a notoriously racist part of Canada, in which
violence against Indigenous people continues to be integral to its
white-dominated culture27 -- yet this polity and its culture are held up
by Newitz as a model of 'human' resilience. By imagining subjects in
whom whiteness is elided with resilience and survival, these discourses
not only normalize and obscure the modes of violence and oppression
through which perceived 'resilience' -- or, in blunt terms, preferential
access to survival -- is achieved. They also work to displace the threat
of total destruction 'onto others who are seen as lacking the
resourcefulness of the survivor'.28

In addition, many ['end of the world' narratives interpellate subjects
of white privilege by assuming that readers are not (currently) affected
by the harms distributed unequally by global structures of environmental
racism]{.underline}. For instance, Barnosky and Hadley29 (italics ours)
state, 'if you are anything like we are, you probably think of pollution
as somebody else's problem. . . you probably don't live near a tannery,
mine dump or any other source of pollution'. [For many people of color,
living near a source of pollution may be nearly inescapable as a result
of structural-material discrimination]{.underline}, including zoning
practices and the accessibility of housing.30 [Viewing ecological harms
as 'someone else's problem' is a **privilege**]{.underline} afforded to
those who have never been forced contemplate the destruction of their
communities or worlds.31 At the same time, these [authors]{.underline}
-- along with many others working in the genre -- [invoke narratives
akin to '**all lives matter**' or '**colour-blindness**]{.underline}'32
[that erase unequal distributions of harm and threat]{.underline}. For
instance, during their international travels for scientific research and
leisure, Barnosky and Hadley (italics ours) describe a dawning awareness
that 'the problems we were writing about. . .were everybody's problems.
. .no one was escaping the impacts. . . including us'. They go on to
[frame as equivalent flooding in Pakistan that displaced 20 million
people and killed 2000 with the inconveniences caused by the temporary
flooding of the New York subway system]{.underline} in 2012. In
addition, they cite evidence of endocrine disruption in American girls
caused by pollution, stating that the youngest of the cohort are African
American and Latina but that 'the most dramatic increase is in Caucasian
girls'33 (italics ours). In this framing, even though BIPOC children
remain most adversely affected, white children are pushed to the
foreground and framed as more urgently threatened in relative terms.
[These comparisons background the disproportionate burden of ecological
harm born by BIPOC, and reflect a stark calculus of the relative value
of white and BIPOC lives]{.underline}. The '[all lives matter' logic
employed here constructs 'a universal human frailty]{.underline}'34 in
which responsibility for ecological threats is attributed to 'humans' in
general, and the assignment of specific culpability is avoided. While
Newitz avers that 'assigning blame \[for ecological harm\] is less
important than figuring out how to. . .survive',35 we argue that
accurately attributing responsibility is crucial to opening up futures
in which it is possible to dismantle the structural oppressions that
unequally distribute harms and chances for collective survival.

[Preoccupation with the subjects of whiteness in 'end of the world'
discourses is also reflected in the framing of BIPOC communities as
threats to the survival of 'humanity]{.underline}'. These fears are
perhaps most simply and starkly expressed in [anxieties over population
decline within predominantly white countries, paired with palpable fear
of rising birth rates amongst BIPOC communities]{.underline}.
Chillingly, such fears are often connected to the mere biological
survival of BIPOC, and the reproductive capacities of Black and Brown
bodies -- especially those coded as 'female', and therefore 'fertile'
within colonial gender binaries.36 For instance, in his treatise on
'over'-population, American settler science writer Alan Weisman
addresses the 'problem' raised by the likely significant increase of
survival rates (especially amongst children) as a result of
widely-available cures for illnesses such as malaria or HIV. Since, he
avers, it would be 'unconscionable' to withhold these vaccines, Weisman
suggests that malaria and HIV research funding should also promote
family planning -- that is, control of BIPOC fertility -- since 'there's
no vaccine against extinction'.37 Here, [BIPOC survival]{.underline} and
reproductivity is literally -- even if not strictly intentionally --
[framed as an incurable disease that could culminate in
'extinction]{.underline}'. Although some of these discussions examine
total growth in human populations globally,38 much of this research
focuses on relative population sizes, usually of BIPOC-majority places
to those inscribed as white. For instance, British doctor John
Guillebaud predicts a 'birth dearth' in Europe while likening
'unremitting population growth' in other parts of the world to 'the
doctrine of the cancer cell'.39 Although these regions are described in
various ways throughout the genre -- for instance, as 'poor' or
'developing', the areas slated for growth are almost always
BIPOC-majority. For example, Hungarian demographer Paul Demeny (italics
ours) argues that Europe's population is steadily shrinking 'while
nearby populations explode'.40 Drawing on Demeny's work, Homer-Dixon
warns of a future 3:1 demographic ratio between North Africa/West Asia
and Europe, along with 70% growth in Bangladesh, 140% growth in Kenya,
and a doubling of the populations of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and
Nigeria. Directly after sharing these statistics, he appends a list of
international news reports referring to, for example, clashes between
Indigenous communities in Kenya, riots in Shanghai, and murder rates in
Mexico.41 In so doing, he directly juxtaposes BIPOC population growth
with stereotypes of violence and 'incivility'.

BIPOC are often represented in these narratives as embodiments of
ecological collapse and threat, embedding the assumption that 'black
people don't care about the environment',42 and that the global 'poor'
will always prioritize short-term economic needs above ecological
concerns. This belief is reflected in travelogue-style descriptions of
ecological devastation, including Barnosky and Hadley's musings, while
on holiday in Utah, that the ancient Puebloan society collapsed because
they had run out of water -- a situation which they project onto future
Sudan, Somalia, and Gaza. In addition, they diagnose the fall of what
they call the 'extinct' Mayan community to overpopulation and
over-exploitation of resources -- despite the survivance43 of over
6 million Mayan people in their Ancestral lands and other places at the
time of writing.44 These descriptions chime with the common refrain on
the part of settler states that BIPOC are unable to care properly for
their land, even in the absence of conflicting data. This constructed
ignorance allows those states to frame BIPOC territories as 'wasteland'
awaiting annexation or improvement, or as dumping grounds for the
externalities of capitalism.45 What's more, the use of BIPOC communities
as cautionary tales for planetary destruction strongly suggests that the
redistribution of global power, land ownership, and other forms of
agency toward BIPOC structures would result in ecological disaster.

#### The affirmative deploys white tears for extinction in order to colonize emotional spaces, dispossess and retraumatize indigenous people, and avoid responsibility for colonialism.

This is a common story. The [emotions of white and other privileged
children (and adults]{.underline}) [are continually **mobilized** to
generate support for global conservation efforts]{.underline}. [Grief
amongst white and other privileged people for the plight of 'endangered'
or 'soon to be extinct' life forms is amongst the most potent of these
emotions]{.underline}, along with anger and frustration. The social
power of these emotions became obvious in the international furore over
the 2015 killing of 'Cecil' the lion by an American recreational hunter.
More recently, video footage of an emaciated polar bear, released by
photographer Paul Nicklen, went viral, igniting an outpouring of regret
and anger on social media. Nicklen described the footage as
'soul-crushing' and related that his entire team had to 'push through
tears' as they watched the bear scrounge for food in the last hours of
its life. (See this article in which Inuk hunters peer review the video,
showing how a lack of understanding of polar bears is often manipulated
by conservation discourses)

[The emotion generated by white and other privileged people]{.underline}
when confronted with images of impending extinction is real, and quite
powerful. It makes its participants feel as though they are involved,
that they care about the beings at stake. And it may generate
substantial donations to conservation organizations with good intentions
and a genuine desire to 'save' the 'endangered'.

But these releases of emotion can also be [deeply problematic, and can
entrench the forces and structures that drive global patterns of
extinction]{.underline} -- including racialized patterns of ecological
violence. I am beginning to understand them as [manifestations of 'white
tears']{.underline}.

'[White tears' refers to the eruption of emotion that occurs when white
people are confronted with the violence and harm that our ways of life
and the structures that benefit us enact against People of
Colour]{.underline}. It is an expression of distress and frustration
that emerges when we find that we are complicit in deep injustices, in
spite of our professed values or conscious intentions. Whether or not
they are expressed as a gesture of solidarity or caring, white tears
have serious and destructive implications for People of Colour.

First, as Robin DiAngelo notes, they involve the appropriation of grief
and other emotions from those who are directly experiencing violence and
harms to their communities, relations and worlds. They divert attention
and social resources such that "rather than focusing on the lived
experiences and traumas of People of Colour...the focus is placed on the
host of emotions that white people go through when confronted with
racism".

[White tears involve the **colonization of emotional
space**]{.underline}, along with the labour required to attend to those
experiencing grief. Indeed, one of the most insidious aspects of [white
tears]{.underline} is that they [make People of Colour **responsible**
for dealing with the guilt their white friends or colleagues feel -- for
participating in systems that oppress them]{.underline}. Instead of
directing this energy towards their own emotional wellbeing and healing,
or performing the hard work of mourning (which I'll return to in a
moment), People of Colour are pressured to shoulder the weight of white
guilt in liquid form.

In many cases, [white tears can be **(re)traumatizing**]{.underline},
and they can remind People of Colour of the depth of white peoples'
indifference to their struggles. In particular, DiAngelo points out that
white tears tend only to emerge in times of public crisis, or when harms
to People of Colour puncture the protective boundaries of white
privilege. This downplays everyday structural violences (including
environmental racism) which People of Colour confront in societies
constructed to privilege white needs and aspirations.

In addition, white tears are a powerful move to innocence. They offer
white folks confronted with injustices in which they're implicated
release, relief and a sense of having 'responded' to the suffering of
others. However, they do not tend to translate into concrete action
against racism or other forms of structural violence, which cause the
harms in question. In some cases, they might detract from this kind of
work by making white folks feel as though they have already 'done
something' (see my story above). What's more, this sense of having
'responded meaningfully' may be used to mask complicity and to disavow
one's responsibility to dismantle structural violence.

How do white tears function in the context of extinction? Let's look at
each of these aspects in turn.

Appropriation, displacement and colonial crying:

[When white and other privileged people grieve for the beings destroyed
by the structures and forces that privilege us, we **take space** from
those who are directly affected]{.underline}. As I have discussed in
previous posts (Decolonizing Against Extinction P I and P II, )
'extinction' is a deeply racialising phenomenon. Driven by modes of
global structural violence such as colonization and extractive
capitalism, it targets and primarily impacts Indigenous and other
peoples of colour -- and their other-than-human relations. In
particular, the plants and animals threatened with what Western science
calls 'extinction' are the relatives -- Ancestors and offspring,
sisters, brothers, cousins and kin -- of these peoples. [Their
'extinction' is the destruction of these relations, and of the (human
and other) peoples nourished by them.]{.underline} Indeed, in my
research I argue that one of the hallmarks of what Western science calls
'extinction' is the destruction of these relationships.

For the most part, the [white and other privileged people who cry 'for'
'endangered species' in the abstract simply do not have these relations
with the beings in question]{.underline}. We are not directly
experiencing the destruction of the intimate relationships -- with
plants, animals, Ancestors, land, water air and more -- that have
sustained our collective existence for millennia, and that are necessary
for its continuation. We do not daily tend and depend on these
relationships, or put their bodies on the line to defend them. In short,
the beings targeted for extinction are not 'ours' to mourn.

Crying for someone else's kin is problematic in (at least) two senses.
First, as in other [manifestations of white tears]{.underline}, this
dynamic [diverts attention, energy and resources away from the
people]{.underline} (human and otherwise) [who are directly affected,
channeling it toward anxiety and guilt of those who **benefit** from the
harms in question]{.underline}. Note that the [global conservation
movement focuses on protecting 'biodiversity' for 'humanity', rather
than directly addressing the harms, losses and violence experienced by
specific peoples whose relations face extinction]{.underline}. However
well-meaning, these efforts are oriented more towards securing and
reassuring donors and their futures -- whom the term 'humanity'
interpellates -- than to addressing the direct trauma of extinction in
ways appropriate to the communities affected.

Second, [this kind of crying can be deeply **dispossessive**: it asserts
proprietary claims over grieved beings]{.underline}. Indeed, this
sentiment -- worry over losing 'our' 'biodiversity', or my childhood
anxieties about not 'having' rhinos or koalas when I grew up --
[embodies the colonial impulse]{.underline} in which the global
conservation movement has its roots. As Bill Adams' critical history
shows, the global conservation movement was rooted in colonial policies,
initially in southern Africa and India, then later in the west of Turtle
Island, designed to protect 'stocks' of large game for elite hunting.
Contemporary conservation organizations have largely moved away from
this approach. In fact, the case of Cecil the lion demonstrates the
extent to which contemporary supporters of conservation oppose the
killing of what they consider to be 'their' endangered species,
protected by their donations. Yet the proprietary impulse remains:
[anger and sadness]{.underline} over Cecil's death [relates directly to
the belief]{.underline}, propagated by conservation organizations, [that
the 'world's biodiversity' is a **commons**, to be protected as a source
of enjoyment, economic stability and scientific knowledge for
'humanity']{.underline}. This is particularly clear in the case of
UNESCO 'World Heritage Sites', which actively name and claim areas of
'particular cultural and biological significance' as the property of
'humanity'.In a related sense, many conservation strategies -- in
particular zoos -- involve an implicit tradeoff in which support for
conservation grants open access to the life forms in question. Indeed,
it is rare to hear of strategies oriented towards the protection of
beings for the sole use of the communities who depend on them, or in
ways that restrict the access of white and other privileged people to
them. Within this global regime, conserved lives are the property of
'humanity'.

As I have argued elsewhere, the idea of humanity enshrined in global
governance discourses is framed in terms of Western ideals such as
individualism (or 'identity'-based collectives), self-sufficiency,
integration into market economics and biopolitically-regulated forms of
health. In other words, it is modelled on liberal-universalist norms
that map well onto modern Euro-American social imaginaries -- and
exclude or marginalise others. So, when land, life forms or even peoples
are claimed as the property of 'humanity', it is a very particular
version of homo sapiens (one that possesses these qualities by birth or
assimilation) that is intended to benefit. By [mobilizing the tears of
white and other privileged people, global conservation encourages these
members of 'humanity' 'save', annex or accumulate other peoples'
relations for their own (future) use and enjoyment]{.underline}. At the
same time, [treating these beings as part of a 'commons' belonging to a
'humanity' defined in their image **erases relations between Indigenous
peoples**]{.underline} and their kin. In this sense, [the mobilization
of white tears contributes to a globalised dispossession of kin that
helps to sustain contemporary global colonialism.]{.underline}

Offloading labour onto those most affected

PMJT regularly engages in white tears, often during formal apologies to
the people he's crying about.

When white and other privileged people cry for beings who are not our
relations, and whom we continue to colonize, we make our feelings
someone else's problem. Specifically, we offload them to the communities
who are directly affected by the destruction of their relations,
expecting them to absorb the costs and labour of protecting them for
'humanity' (meaning us). This is not primarily to ensure the ongoingness
of these communities and their relations, their sovereignty or
well-being, but rather to assuage our guilt, and our fear of 'losing'
beings that might prove essential to our own well-being (or that of an
abstract 'humanity').

In the context of global conservation movements, this can take many
forms. One of the most common is the expectation that Indigenous people
give up their land, practices of hunting, gathering and growing or other
ways of life in order to create parks or other 'protected' spaces.
Indeed, as Dan Brockington and Jim Igoe have shown, the creation of
national parks in southern Africa involved the eviction and displacement
of thousands of Indigenous people from their Ancestral or traditional
lands, continuing well into the 1990s, in order to meet goals derived
from Western conservation practices. In other cases, the process of
offloading responsibility is more subtle. It may involve framing
Indigenous people as 'stewards' of 'biodiversity' and simply presuming
that they will take on the labour of protecting it; or encouraging
Indigenous communities to engage in 'biodiversity banking' or
offsetting. These strategies are essentially means for stockpiling
biodiversity to hedge against its continued destruction and ensure the
'sustainability' of the systems that exploit it.

Indeed, [white tears for extinction not only **divert attention away**
from those who are directly experiencing the harms, and the violent
nature of those harms, but also from the structures that perpetuate
them]{.underline}. By [**outsourcing the labour** of conservation to
Indigenous communities]{.underline}, this [system expects those
communities to provide cushions and guarantees for the same systems that
oppress, expropriate and target them]{.underline}.

The tears themselves are also a potent move to innocence. They enable
white and other privileged people to feel that we are performing
constructive emotional labour that generates empathy, compassion or
solidarity with the others whom our structures have harmed. In some
cases, these acts may (re-)traumatize or provoke anger amongst those
whose relatives and worlds are targeted for destruction. Having to deal
with this additional emotional labour, or the need to 'educate' and
confront those shedding white tears, drains vital energy from the
crucial work of resurgence and caring for one's relations carried out by
Indigenous and People of Colour.

We only care in a crisis, or when it affects us

The primary reason that I and other white children were taught to 'love'
endangered species was that we grew up during an era in which extinction
had been identified as a crisis that might effect us. Specifically,
extinction was, and continues to be, framed as a trend that might
endanger 'human security' or the wellbeing of 'humanity' as a whole. In
other words, the crisis was becoming large enough to endanger the
futures of some of the most privileged people on the planet. The same
kind of fear animates contemporary concerns with 'global catastrophic
risks' -- phenomena so enormous in their scale and totality that they
even threaten the global elite. Indeed, if billionaires such as Elon
Musk consider it necessary to colonize other planets as an 'insurance
policy' against the total destruction of earth, then it is clear that
the threat has spread to the world's most privileged niches.
Preoccupation with moments of spectacular collapse or disruption that
puncture the protective bubble of white and other forms of privilege can
be deeply destructive. Specifically, they draw attention away from the
everyday, persistent, 'slow' and deep forms of everyday structural
violence that drive global patterns of extinction.

Understood in this way, tearful fear and anxiety about the 'loss of
species' is linked to the desire to protect white futures, and the
beings that are considered necessary -- or simply desirable -- to them.
The selectiveness of globalized grieving for the extinct is telling
here. The poster children of conservation campaigns are
disproportionately megafauna that dwell in places colonized by Europeans
-- from polar bears and lions to koalas and lemurs. Through colonial
education systems, they have become so thoroughly embedded in cultural
imaginaries that Western children are more likely to recognize megafauna
from other continents than plants endemic to the lands where they live.
The 'loss' of these beings creates ruptures in this possessive imaginary
and the models of global political order it supports.

In this way, the stimulation of white tears for 'endangered species'
privileges certain relationships and futures over others. Indeed, while
it is common for conservation organisations to promote the protection of
animals that white tourists find 'majestic' or scientifically
fascinating, it is much rarer to see global campaigns to protect life
forms that primarily enable Indigenous food sovereignty. For instance
the decimation of the buffalo on the great plains of Turtle Island is
not often held up as an example of extinction, nor are the buffalo
prioritized as images of the urgency of conservation. This is almost
certainly because this attempted buffalo genocide was integral to the
foundation of settler colonial states of Canada and the United States,
and does not fit within the passive, non-violent, 'natural' notion of
extinction upon which global conservation focuses. More to the point,
the buffalo are integral to Indigenous futures on Turtle Island, but not
to white imaginaries of how this land should be occupied. This helps to
explain why there is relatively little grieving for them, or demands for
their urgent return, amongst the settlers of Turtle Island.

Moves to innocence, or, crying away complicity

[White tears for 'endangered' or 'extinct' life forms help to **gloss
over** one's complicity in the structures of destruction.]{.underline}
As mentioned above, [focusing attention on spectacular crises that
affect the world's privileged helps to distract it from the formations
of everyday, cross-cutting violence -- land-based, gendered, racializing
and more]{.underline} -- of which 'crises' are one aspect. This is one
of the reasons why '**[extinction']{.underline}** is so rarely
understood [as a **manifestation of violence**]{.underline}. Failure to
recognize the nature of the oppressive relations that drive extinction
precludes meaningful responses to it. In short, performing grief for
beings with whom we do not have intimate relationships -- either out of
guilt and shame or fear of 'loss' -- is unlikely to translate into
concerted action to dismantle the systems that drive the violence in
question. Instead, it enables white and other privileged people to feel
that we have cared, or responded, without having to make substantial
changes to our own conditions or lives.

#### Settler colonial literature [weaponizes]{.underline} extinction as a metaphor to veil [decolonization]{.underline} into order to emphasize settler identity over [erasure]{.underline} of indigenous people

remarked how surprising it is that this theme is so present. For
settlers, of all people, to obsessively ruminate on their own finitude
is counterintuitive, for [few modern social for- mations have been more
resistant to change than settler colonialism]{.underline}. With a few
excep- tions (French Algeria being the largest), the settler societies
established in the last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and
Southern Africa have all retained the basic features that define them as
settler states [-- [namely]{.underline}]{.mark}, the structural
[[privileg]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[of settler]{.mark}s [at the expense
of indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the
[normalization of whiteness]{.mark} as the marker of pol- itical agency
and rights]{.underline} -- and they have done so notwithstanding the
sustained resistance that has been mounted whenever such an order has
been built. [[Settlers think]{.underline}]{.mark} all the time that
[[they might]{.mark} one day [end]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} even
though (perhaps [[because]{.underline}) [that ending seems unlikely ever
to happen]{.underline}]{.mark}. The significance of this paradox for
settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article.

Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional
analyses of settler- colonial narrative, which typically examine
[settlers' attitudes towards [history]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to
[[highlight(s)]{.underline}]{.mark} a [constitutive [anxiety]{.mark}
[about the past]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- about origins]{.underline}.
Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with historical
narration that arises from a contradiction in its founding mythology. In
Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler subject is by defi- nition one
who comes from elsewhere but who strives to make this place home. [[The
settle- ment narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} must explain how this gap --
[[which is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has been
bridged]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the settler transformed from outsider
into indigene.

Yet the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because
the desire to be at home necessarily invokes [the spectre of [the
native]{.mark}, [whose existence]{.mark} ([which]{.mark} cannot be
disavowed completely because it [is needed to define the settler's
difference, superior- ity, and hence claim to the
land]{.mark}]{.underline}) in[scribes]{.underline} the
[settler]{.underline}'s [foreignness]{.underline}, thus reinstating the
gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to efface.

[Settler-[colonial narra- tive is]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[shaped
around its need to erase and evoke the native]{.mark}, [to make]{.mark}
the [indigene]{.mark} both [invisible]{.mark} and present in a
contradictory pattern that prevents settlers from ever moving on from
the moment of colonization.]{.underline} As [evidence of
this]{.underline} constitutive contradic- tion, critics have identified
[in]{.underline} [[settler-colonial discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}
symptoms of psychic [[distress]{.underline}]{.mark} [such as disavowal,
[inversion]{.mark}, [and repression]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, the
frozen temporality of settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment
of the frontier, recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the
'repetition compulsion' attending trauma. As Lorenzo Veracini puts it,
because: 'settler society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a
perception of a constant struggle is jux- taposed against an ideal of
'peace' that can never be reached, [settler projects embrace and reject
violence at the same time. The settler colonial situation is thus a
circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses produces
long-lasting]{.underline} psychic [conflicts]{.underline} and a number
of associated psychopathologies.

Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on [settler-colonial
narrative's view of the past]{.underline}, [ask]{.underline}ing
[how]{.underline} such a contradictory and
[[troubled]{.underline}]{.mark} relationship to
[[history]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[affect present-day ideological
formations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Critics have rarely considered what
such narratological tensions might produce when the settler gaze is
turned to the future. Few social for- mations are more stubbornly
resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that a future beyond
settler colonialism might be simply unthinkable. Veracini, indeed,
suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never contemplate an
ending: that settler decolonization is inconceivable because settlers
lack the metaphorical tools to imagine their own demise.

This article outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I argue that
the narra- tological paradox that defines settler-colonial narrative
does make the future a problematic object of contemplation. But that
does not make settler decolonization unthinkable per se; as I will show,
settlers do often try to imagine their demise -- but they do so in a way
that reasserts the paradoxes of their founding ideology, with the result
that the radical poten- tiality of decolonization is undone even as it
is invoked. I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, [there
is]{.underline} [a [metaphor]{.underline} via]{.mark} [which [the end of
settler colonialism unspools -- the]{.mark} quasi-biological [concept of
extinction]{.mark}, which, when deployed as a narrative trope, [offers
settlers a chance to consider and disavow their demise]{.mark}, [just as
they]{.mark} consider and then [disavow the violence of their
origins]{.mark}.]{.underline} This article traces the importance of the
trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial litera- ture, with
a focus on South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It explores variations
in how [[the]{.mark} [death of]{.mark} settler [colonialism is
conceptualized]{.mark}]{.underline}, [draw]{.underline}ing a distinction
between his- torio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of
empires, and [[a]{.mark} species-oriented [notion of extinction]{.mark}
that [draws]{.mark} force [from public anxiety about climate
change]{.mark} -- an invo- cation that adds another level of ambivalence
[by drawing on 'rational' fears for the future]{.mark} (because climate
change may well render the planet uninhabitable to humans) [in order to
narrativize a form of social death]{.mark} that, strictly speaking,
belongs to a different order of knowledge altogether.]{.underline} As
such, my analysis is intended to draw the attention of settler- colonial
studies toward futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia, while
highlighting a potential point of cross-fertilization between
settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.

That 'extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise. In

Patrick Wolfe's phrase, settler colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of
elimination' that

tends towards the extermination -- by one means or another -- of
indigenous peoples.

This logic is apparent in archetypal settler narratives like James
Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans (1826), a historical novel
whose very title blends the melancholia and triumph that demarcate
settlers' affective responses to the supposed inevitability of
indigenous extinction. Concepts like 'stadial development'-- by which
[[societies]{.underline}]{.mark} progress through stages, [progressively
[eliminat]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[earlier social forms -- and 'fatal
impact']{.underline}-- [which names the biological inevitability of
strong peoples supplanting weak]{.underline}]{.mark} [-- all contrib-
ute to [the notion that settler colonialism is a kind of
'ecological]{.mark} [process]{.mark}' that [necessitates the extinction
of inferior races.]{.mark}]{.underline} What is surprising, though, is
how often [the trope of [extinc- tion]{.mark} also [appears]{.mark}
[with reference to settlers]{.mark} themselves]{.underline};
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} [[makes]{.underline}]{.mark} sense for
[[settlers]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[narrate how their presence entails
others' destruction]{.mark}, but it is less clear why their attempts to
imagine futures should presume extinction to be their own logical end as
well]{.underline}. The idea appears repeatedly in English-language
literary treatments of settler colonial- ism. Consider, for instance,
the following rumination on the future of South African settler society,
from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm: It was one of
them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those pictures there.
He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make something, so he
made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never
see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild
bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone
soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at everything like they
look now.

This article enters the debate between [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} two
[[perspective]{.mark}s]{.underline} by asking what it means for settler
writers to [[imagine the future via the trope of
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Does extinction offer]{.mark} a
meaningful [way(s)]{.mark} [to]{.mark} think about [end]{.mark}ing
[settler colonialism]{.mark}, [or does it re-activate
settler-colonial]{.mark} [patterns]{.mark} of thought that allow
exclusionary social structures to persist?]{.underline} I explore this
question with reference to examples of contemporary literary treatments
of extinction from select English-speaking settler-colonial contexts:
South Africa, Australia, and Canada. The next section of this article
traces key elements of extinction narrative in a range of
settler-colonial texts, while the section that follows offers a detailed
reading of one of the best examples of a sustained literary exploration
of human finitude, Margaret Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I
advance four specific arguments. First, [extinc- tion
narratives]{.underline} [take]{.underline} at least [two
forms]{.underline} depending on whether [the 'end' of settler society is
framed primarily in historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger,
biological sense;]{.underline} [the]{.underline} key [question
is]{.underline} whether [the 'thing' that is going extinct is a society
or a species]{.underline}. Second, [bio- logically oriented extinction
narratives rely on a more or less conscious slippage between 'the
settler' and 'the human']{.underline}. Third, [this]{.underline}
slippage [is]{.underline} [ideologically ambivalent]{.underline}: on the
one hand, [it]{.underline} contains a radical [charge(s)]{.underline}
that invokes [environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to
imagine social forms]{.underline} that re-write settler-colonial
dynamics; on the other, [it replicates]{.underline} a [core aspect of
imperialist ideology by normalizing whiteness as equivalent to
humanity]{.underline}. Fourth, these ideological effects are mediated by
gender, insofar as [extinction narratives invoke issues of biological
reproduction, community protection, and violence]{.underline} that
function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine roles in the
puta- tive de-colonial future. Overall, my central claim is that
[extinction is a core trope through which settler futurity emerges, one
with crucial narrative and ideological effects that shape much of the
contemporary literature emerging from white colonial
settings.]{.underline}

### Alternative Cuttings of Dalley

#### Extinction is a settler narrative that excuses indigenous genocide as a biological inevitability.

That ['extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler
colonialism is predicated on a **'logic of elimination'** that tends
towards the extermination]{.underline} -- by one means or another -- [of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal
[settler narratives]{.underline} like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last
of the Mohicans (1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the
melancholia and triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to
the [supposed inevitability of indigenous extinction.]{.underline}
Concepts like 'stadial development' -- by which societies progress
through stages, progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and
['**fatal impact'**]{.underline} -- which [names the **biological
inevitability** of strong peoples supplanting weak]{.underline} -- all
[contribute to the notion that settler colonialism is a kind of
'ecological process']{.underline} 9 that necessitates the extinction of
inferior races. What is surprising, though, is how often the trope of
extinction also appears with reference to settlers themselves; it makes
sense for settlers to narrate how their presence entails others'
destruction, but it is less clear why their attempts to imagine futures
should presume extinction to be their own logical end as well. The idea
appears repeatedly in English-language literary treatments of settler
colonialism. Consider, for instance, the following rumination on the
future of South African settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883
Story of an African Farm: It was one of them, one of those wild old
Bushmen, that painted those pictures there. He did not know why he
painted but he wanted to make something, so he made these. \[...\] Now
the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a yellow face peeping
out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild bucks have gone, and those
days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only the stones
will lie on, looking at everything like they look now.10 In this
example, the narrating settler character, Waldo, recognizes prior
indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes freighted with an
expected [sense of biological superiority]{.underline}, made apparent by
his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack of mental
self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation of
**[colonial genocide]{.underline}** should turn immediately to the
assumption that a similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar
presumption of racial vulnerability permeates other late
nineteenthcentury novels from the imperial metropole, such as Dracula
and War of the Worlds, which are plotted around the prospect of
invasions that would see the extinction of British imperialism, and, in
the process, the human species. Such anxieties draw energy from a
pattern of settler defensiveness that can be observed across numerous
settler-colonial contexts. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of
the emergence of transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical
fact that while white male settlers have been arguably the most
privileged class in history, they have routinely perceived themselves to
be 'under siege', threatened with destruction to the extent that their
very identity of 'whiteness was born in the apprehension of imminent
loss'. 11 The [fear of looming annihilation serves a powerful
ideological function in settler communities, working to foster racial
solidarity, suppress dissent, and **legitimate** violence against
indigenous populations]{.underline} who, by any objective measure, are
far more at risk of extermination than the settlers who fear them. Ann
Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this pattern in Australia and
Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 This scholarship suggests that
narratives of settler extinction are acts of ideological mystification,
obscuring the brutal inequalities of the frontier behind a mask of white
vulnerability -- an argument with which I sympathize. However, this
article shows how [there is more to settler-colonial extinction
narratives than bad faith.]{.underline} I argue that we need a more
nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically
[settler-colonial framework for imagining the future,]{.underline} one
that has implications for how we understand contemporary literatures
from settler societies, and which allows us to see extinction as a
genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage social change. In the remainder
of this paper I consider extinction's function as a metaphor of
decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke, without completely
endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that to treat decolonization
figuratively, as I argue [extinction narratives]{.underline} do, is
necessarily to preclude radical change, [creating opportunities for
settler 'moves to innocence' that re-legitimate racial
inequality]{.underline}.13 The counterview to this pessimistic
perspective is offered by Veracini, who suggests that progressive change
to settler-colonial relationships will only happen if narratives can be
found that make decolonization thinkable.14 This article enters the
debate between these two perspectives by asking what it means for
settler writers to imagine the future via the trope of extinction. Does
extinction offer a meaningful way to think about ending settler
colonialism, or does it re-activate settler-colonial patterns of thought
that allow exclusionary social structures to persist? I explore this
question with reference to examples of contemporary literary treatments
of extinction from select English-speaking settler-colonial contexts:
South Africa, Australia, and Canada.15 The next section of this article
traces key elements of extinction narrative in a range of
settler-colonial texts, while the section that follows offers a detailed
reading of one of the best examples of a sustained literary exploration
of human finitude, Margaret Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I
advance four specific arguments. First, [extinction
narratives]{.underline} take at least two forms depending on whether the
'end' of settler society is framed primarily in
historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger,
[biological]{.underline} sense; the key [question is whether the 'thing'
that is going extinct is a society or a species]{.underline}. Second,
biologically oriented extinction narratives rely on a more or less
conscious slippage between 'the settler' and 'the human'.
Historical-civilizational narratives of extinction thereby literally
enact what Tuck and Yang call a 'move to innocence'. By [looking beyond
the end of settler colonialism, they imagine futures in which 'settler
guilt and complicity' will be washed away]{.underline}, and the settler
him- or herself will metamorphose into a liberated subjectivity.

#### Focus on far-off extinction is settler rhetoric that comes at the expense of the indigenous.

**Dalley 16**, Associate Professor and Chair of English at Daemen
College, Amherst; Phd (Hamish, 2016, "The deaths of settler colonialism:

[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}; to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come. This tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced since the 1980s[: the possibility of an ending -- the
likelihood that the settler race will one day die out -- is a common
theme]{.underline} in literary and pop culture considerations of
colonialism's future. Yet it has barely been remarked how surprising it
is that this theme is so present. For [settlers]{.underline}, of all
people, to [obsessively ruminate on their own finitude]{.underline} is
counterintuitive, for few modern social formations have been more
resistant to change than settler colonialism. With a few exceptions
(French Algeria being the largest), the settler societies established in
the last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and Southern Africa
have all retained the basic features that define them as settler states
-- namely, the structural privileging of settlers [at the expense of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}, and the normalization of whiteness as
the marker of political agency and rights -- and they have done so
notwithstanding the sustained resistance that has been mounted whenever
such an order has been built. [Settlers think all the time that they
might one day end, even though (perhaps because) that ending seems
unlikely ever to happen]{.underline}. The significance of this paradox
for settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article.
Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional
analyses of settlercolonial narrative, which typically examine settlers'
attitudes towards history in order to highlight a constitutive anxiety
about the past -- about origins. Settler colonialism, the argument goes,
has a problem with historical narration that arises from a contradiction
in its founding mythology. In Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler
subject is by definition one who comes from elsewhere but who strives to
make this place home[. The settlement narrative must explain how this
gap -- which is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has
been bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into
indigene]{.underline}. Yet the transformation must remain constitutively
incomplete, because the desire to be at home necessarily invokes the
spectre of the native, whose existence (which cannot be disavowed
completely because it is needed to define the settler's difference,
superiority, and hence claim to the land) inscribes the settler's
foreignness, thus reinstating the gap between settler and colony that
the narrative was meant to efface.1 [Settler-colonial narrative is thus
shaped around its need to erase and evoke the native]{.underline}, to
make the indigene both invisible and present in a contradictory pattern
that prevents settlers from ever moving on from the moment of
colonization.2 As evidence of this constitutive contradiction, critics
have identified in settler-colonial discourse symptoms of psychic
distress such as disavowal, inversion, and repression.3 Indeed, the
frozen temporality of [settler-colonial narrative, fixated
on]{.underline} the moment of [the frontier]{.underline}, recalls
nothing so much as Freud's description of the 'repetition compulsion'
attending trauma.4 As Lorenzo Veracini puts it, because: ['settler
society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a perception of a constant
struggle is juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be
reached, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the same
time.]{.underline} The settler colonial situation is thus a circumstance
where the tension between contradictory impulses produces long-lasting
psychic conflicts and anumber of associated psychopathologies.5 Current
scholarship has thus focused primarily on settler-colonial narrative's
view of the past, asking how such a contradictory and troubled
relationship to history might affect present-day ideological formations.
Critics have rarely considered what such narratological tensions might
produce when the [settler gaze is turned to the future]{.underline}. Few
social formations are more stubbornly resistant to change than
settlement, suggesting that a future beyond settler colonialism might be
simply unthinkable. Veracini, indeed, suggests that settler-colonial
narrative can never contemplate an ending: that settler decolonization
is inconceivable because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine

potentiality of decolonization is undone even as it is invoked. I argue
that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, there is a metaphor via which
the end of settler colonialism unspools -- the quasi-biological concept
of extinction, which, when deployed as a narrative trope, offers
settlers a chance to consider and disavow their demise, just as they
consider and then disavow the violence of their origins. This article
traces the importance of the trope of extinction for contemporary
settler-colonial literature, with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and
Australia. It explores variations in how the death of settler
colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction between
historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of empires, and
a species-oriented notion of extinction that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that adds another level of
ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the future (because
climate change may well render the planet uninhabitable to humans) in
order to narrativize a form of social death that, strictly speaking,
belongs to a different order of knowledge altogether. As such, my
analysis is intended to draw the attention of settlercolonial studies
toward futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia, while
highlighting a potential point of cross-fertilization between
settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.

[A **common epistemological premise of research with Indigenous people**
in Russia is that state governance **is grounded in domination, economic
exploitation, and environmental injustice**]{.underline} (Donahoe,
2009). [Scholars h**ave provided** elaborate accounts of the
**Indigenous peoples' suffering** and resistance]{.underline} (Anderson,
2000). In this context, the support of Indigenous
**[organizations]{.underline}** and individuals for the Russian war in
Ukraine raises many questions. Indigenous people seem not only loyal to
Russian authorities but also **[willing to make huge sacrifices,
including the loss of Indigenous lives]{.underline}**. In this article,
I cast light on this contradiction by analysing ethnographic data
collected between 1996 and 2017 that uncovers how
**[militarization]{.underline}** in Russia **[is a realm for governance
of people and land and produces Indigenous subjectivities that are more
likely to live with, tolerate, and accept war]{.underline}**. Kola
Peninsula, the geographical region of this study, is a borderland with
Finland and Norway and a key part of a heavily militarized area known as
Russia's Barents Sea bastion (Regehr, 2023). Russia's Northern Fleet is
located there with some of the most important ports for servicing
nuclear submarines in Gremikha, Zapadnaia Litza, Poliarny, and Vydiaevo.
Air force bases Olen'ia and Pechenga, and nuclear missile bases
Ostrovnoi and Severomorsk, were constructed in the 1950s--1960s, and
after a period of decline in the 1990s are now being rebuilt (Melino et
al., 2020). Reorganizations in 2010 and 2014 elevated the status of the
Northern Fleet and made the region the headquarters of Russia's Arctic
military command (Kjellén, 2022). Here, I apply the notion of
militarization as described by social scientists: A process of social
**[and material production by which states apply violence in order to
achieve certain results, (such as sovereignty, defense or even expansion
of state territory)]{.underline}**, which they present as legitimate
(Lutz, 2002). Militarization in the Kola Peninsula **[has been justified
as defending against the West]{.underline}** both during the Cold War
and during the present war in Ukraine. Militarization includes the
construction of military infrastructure, and stationing a large number
of military personnel in the area. Of equal importance are the long‐term
formation of social institutions, knowledge, identity reconstruction,
ideology, and values, driven by historical and Communist legacies, that
all serve militarization and help justify its purposes and cost (Lankina
et al., 2016; Lutz, 2002). **[Militarism]{.underline}**, as defined by
scholars, **[is]{.underline}** a much narrower term, attending to how a
society forms its values [around war as **a way of protecting its
sovereignty and security**]{.underline}. Milit[a]{.underline}rism's
focus is o[n]{.underline} the political sphere **[and]{.underline}** on
social transformation driven by war‐centred values, while militarization
**[incorporates both the material and discursive aspects of military
domination]{.underline}** (Lutz, 2002). In this study I do not
distinguish between these terms as I believe that material
infrastructure is instrumental in knowledge and value formation (Bruno,
2019). Materiality is a mechanism of state power and is formative of
Indigenous subjectivities as much as ideology. Previous studies on
post‐communist societies shed light on the power of propaganda and media
on social behaviour, public opinion, trust, and attitudes (Ambrosio et
al., 2022; Arpino & Obydenkova, 2020; Demchuk et al., 2022; Hall et al.,
2022[). **Indigenous people in the**]{.underline} Russian Arctic
**[are]{.underline}** influenced both by the historical legacies and the
contemporary "information war" of ideological indoctrination.
Subjectivity is understood in this study as constitutive of governance
over Indigenous subjects. Subjects are **[constituted by power, both
power over and the power to act]{.underline}** (Burchell et al., 1991).
Subjectivities shape individuals' will and identity. [Dominant knowledge
and discourses orient subjects in terms of what is "normal" and
expected. Subjects internalize a continual reflexive self‐discipline
that enforces normality and collective social control over
individuals]{.underline}. Feminist theorists (Butler, 1997) contribute
to the analysis of subjectivities by stressing their plural and dynamic
character, and how they are constituted by material and embodied
practices. Studies on animal subjectivities emphasise the importance of
material things within a complex ecology (Holloway, 2007). As Anderson
et al. (2017) argue, human relations with animals are inscribed in
material infrastructures, such as fences and corrals. In reindeer
husbandry, human and animal subjectivities evolve in constant
interaction with each other and militarization and its materiality are
important factors in the process. Andy Bruno, who writes about
environmental subjectivities in Russia, provides a review of research on
subjectivity in the region (Bruno, 2019). [Despite discourses of
demilitarization]{.underline} in the 1990s, grounded in regional
international cooperation for peace and environmental sustainability in
the Arctic (Regehr, 2023), Kola Peninsula did not actively move away
from militarized governance, partially due to entrenched Communist
legacies. In this article, I explore continuous militarization by
engaging with two phenomena: (a) the impact of fencing off territories
for military use and infrastructure, and (b) the impact of nuclear
pollution and international cooperation around it. These have been
selected as reflecting directly perceived material infrastructure, as
well as the more invisible and slowly evolving impact of nuclear
pollution on local residents and land users' environmental knowledge,
everyday spatial practices, and bodily activities. I reveal how both
visible and invisible infrastructures and impacts of militarization are
being normalized as part of the terrain, air, and water, and define
human movement and activities in the environment. I discuss how
materiality and knowledge are interrelated in maintaining Indigenous
subjectivities in line with the objectives of militarization. Following
the recent literature on regionalism and its relation to autocracy,
propaganda, and Communist legacies (Libman & Obydenkova, 2018;
Obydenkova, 2022a; Obydenkova & Libman, 2019), I show how Russia uses
its participation in the Barents Euro‐Arctic Region (BEAR), to support
the objectives of militarization and justify them among local
population. My premise is that continuous militarization, naturalized in
the environment and normalized in the bodily and knowledge practices of
local residents is being employed by the authorities to solidify the
present autocratic regime in the Arctic. Social scientists emphasize the
intersectionality of **[militarization]{.underline}** (Enloe, 2000). As
part of state formation, it **[produces inequalities along ethnic,
cultural, economic, and gender divides]{.underline}** (Gill, 1997).
**[Discriminatory attitudes towards certain ethnic groups]{.underline}**
in Russia are pronounced today, as pointed out by studies on historical
legacies (Libman & Obydenkova, 2019, 2020). In the Kola Peninsula
**[militarization intersects with processes, such as stereotypical
representations of Indigenous culture and individuals as less developed,
and of Indigenous economic activities as primitive and incompatible with
modern econom]{.underline}**y (Vladimirova, 2014). These make excluding
territories from reindeer herding for military purposes easier to
justify or conceal. This article incorporates ethnographic material
collected by the author through numerous trips among Indigenous reindeer
herders and village residents in the Kola Peninsula between 2001 and
2014. I quote published data and media sources, and I preserve the
anonymity of individuals involved in this research due to personal
security reasons. The region has been off‐limit for ethnographic
fieldwork for foreigners since 2017, but the period presented here
(1990s--2017) is highly relevant for understanding the mechanisms of
ongoing militarization with bases being rebuilt and military propaganda
strengthened in recent years. In Section 2, I briefly describe reindeer
herding in the Kola Peninsula in the light of militarization. Section 3
shows how militarization is an area for spatial practices and social
relations among Indigenous reindeer herders. In Section 4, I turn to
nuclear pollution as a source of environmental knowledge and spatial
practices, but simultaneously of normalization of militarization through
international cooperation. [Throughout the article, I analyze how
**militarism is instilled in Indigenous life activities through
materiality and knowledge practices, and** how it is **being
normalized**. This analysis contributes to often overlooked dimensions
of regional governance in the Arctic that transformed the life and
subjectivities of Indigenous people and aligned them with the military
goals of the state]{.underline}. Politics and Governance • 2024 • Volume
12 • Article 7505 3 2. Indigenous People and Militarization in the Kola
Peninsula Kola Peninsula is the home of the Sami Indigenous minority in
Russia. A small group of reindeer herding Komi migrated to the region in
late 19th century. These groups continue to be involved in reindeer
husbandry today, despite the latter's insignificant role in the local
economy. According to Russian legislation, only groups under 50,000
people who live in their ancestral territories are classified as
Small‐Numbered Native Peoples of the North, a category that only Sami
fit. This article, however, focuses on phenomena that affect equally
Komi and Sami reindeer herders, who share a marginal status and
historical legacies of Russian colonization. Despite Russian
definitions, I use here Indigenous for both groups, as the concept is
applied globally. Other local residents also experience varieties of
**[militarization]{.underline}**, but I focus on Indigenous reindeer
herders as a strongly marginalized category (Vladimirova, 2006).
Reindeer herding was collectivized by the Soviet state and transformed
to meet official ideas about the modernization and industrialization of
the Arctic. At the time of this research, two reindeer enterprises
operated. Cooperative Tundra whose territories border several military
bases, is the focus of the present study. According to official
documents, it is organized as follows: The reindeer are divided into 9
herds with 1,500--2,000 reindeer each. Herding teams (brigades in local
parlance) of 7--9 people take care of each herd. Each brigade has a
territory where its herd is supposed to follow its seasonal migration,
in most cases over a few hundred kilometres. Despite Soviet ideas of
controlled intensive reindeer breeding, at least since the 1990s
extensive free‐range herding has been dominant (Vladimirova, 2014).
Brigades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, located in the north‐western part of the
territory are called left‐wing, and ethnic Sami are well represented in
them. Brigades 1, 2, 8, and 9 in the eastern part constitute the
right‐wing and the majority of herders in them identify as Komi. Once or
twice a year each wing jointly drives all brigade herds into a corral
for the purposes of counting the animals, marking calves and selecting
animals for slaughter. Konstantinov (2023) describes de facto reindeer
herding organization of Tundra in the 2020s which shows a further
decrease in herds and depopulation of the sector. Militarization and
industrialization have been major drivers of territorial planning in the
Kola Peninsula. They have caused major transformations of landscapes and
spatial and social practices. In addition to the large number of
incoming population to service the military and industrial production,
they forcefully moved Sami residents of old villages from the Barents
Sea coastal area to a smaller number of villages in the interior of the
peninsula in the course of the 1950s--1960s (Konstantinov, 2005). In the
Census from 2010, Sami numbered approximately 1,600, with the biggest
group in the village of Lovozero, and Komi also numbered 1,600.
Centralization has contributed to the consolidation of administrative
power over local people. Reindeer herders, living and moving about over
the territory, have been perceived as a hindrance both to industrial
exploitation and militarization. Soviet spatial planning **[excluded
Indigenous people from large territories with outcomes extending far
beyond limitations on movement and land use. This has transformed the
economy, culture, and identities, and imposed new knowledge about the
surrounding social world, where the Military‐Industrial
Complex]{.underline}** as it is designated in Russia**[, are a superior
power, answerable to their own centralized command and not subject to
local administration or police]{.underline}** (Hønneland & Jørgensen,
1998). **[Narratives of Indigenous displacement have become an important
part of identity formation and ethnic mobilization among Sami people.
Narratives blaming militarization for violence to Indigenous people are
common in Indigenous oral culture, as in other parts of the
world]{.underline}** (Kuletz, 2001). Politics and Governance • 2024 •
Volume 12 • Article 7505 4 3. Fencing off Territories The visible
impacts of militarization in the Kola Peninsula are the partitioning of
land, fencing off big territories for military use, and excluding
Indigenous people and animals from the land. These processes intersect
with major Soviet policies of transformation of Indigenous people in the
name of modernization, such as re‐organization of land use and economy,
Indigenous social organization, and cultural practices. These have
resulted in reconceptualizing reindeer as a species, and transforming
ideas about their behaviour, methods of breeding, and economic and
cultural importance. Material infrastructure has an important place in
this reformation (Anderson et al., 2017). In the sphere of
militarization, materiality is of special interest, because for security
reasons it is simultaneously hidden from the uninitiated and present in
order to maintain the fear of potential enemies. The territory of
military installations and personnel is carefully marked off, i.e.,
fenced, creating a material and symbolic barrier to stop both movement
and scrutiny of the uninitiated. In addition to fencing, military
facilities and their testing have material impacts on human, animal, and
plant populations, through polluting discharges and waste.
**[Militarization's hazardous nature creates environmental injustice
(Gregson & Crang, 2010). Military pollution, such as organic materials,
chemicals, and landmines constitute dangerously altered ecosystems that
reshape human individuals and communities (Kim, 2016). Fencing off
territories from Indigenous use transforms space and creates new spatial
configurations]{.underline}**. Knowledge of these militarized landscapes
is slowly internalized as people re‐learn the territory and adapt
environmental practices and relations. Embodied spatial practices among
reindeer and herders who use and know such landscapes best are heavily
affected by military infrastructures and personnel. Below in this
section, I offer ethnographic examples of spatial knowledge practices
shaped by militarization. These narratives both critique and acknowledge
complementarity between reindeer herders and the military. Their
evaluations also point to the wide acceptance of militarization in life,
reindeer economy, and land. Contemporary theory offers a sophisticated
analysis of borders' profound impact on humans and nature (Netz, 2004).
Human and animal mobility and knowledge about space and the surrounding
world are shaped by human‐created borders (Hodgetts & Lorimer, 2020).
One of the most striking forms of fenced‐off military spaces oLooking at
the map, later Konstantinov noticed the road continuing for another 25
kilometres to the notorious Olenegorsk Eight. Herders of Brigade 3,
called the town Tsar Gorodok (King of Towns), or diminutively "Tsarka,"
and pointed to it as the home of most poachers on their herd. It is part
of the military base Olen'ia, built in the 1950s as a Russian Navy
reconnaissance post, and since 2011 a long‐range aviation base.
Konstantinov describes the stretch of road leading to ZATO as empty with
military installations visible on both sides: "A huge building with a
concavely curved facade was said to have jet‐planes flying out from the
various floors"n the Kola Peninsula is the "closed towns" that were
hidden on Soviet maps, and designated by numbers instead of names. The
existence of ZATO (in Russian, zakrytoe administrativno‐territorial'noe
obrazovanie, a closed administrative‐territorial unit) was officially
admitted only in the 1990s, but they continued to be under the
administration of the Ministry of Defence. Each ZATO is connected to a
particular base and provides housing for its personnel's families
(Hønneland & Jørgensen, 1998). While for locals the ban on visits to
ZATOs is part of tacit knowledge, anthropologist Yulian Konstantinov
describes how in 1995 he and his companion took the road to a town that
does not appear on any map in order to see what would happen. A railway
line ran parallel to the road and no sign indicated where it led ): A
cross‐beam appeared and a sergeant in a navy uniform and a black fur‐hat
with ear‐flaps emerged wearily out of a sentry‐box. ---You cannot
continue from here---he said in Russian---You have to turn back. ---What
is the name of this town?---Helena asked innocently. ---Olenegorsk
Eight. In the right‐wing, Brigade 9 is adjacent to the ZATO of
Ostrovnoi, or Murmansk‐140. The adjacent Gremikha Naval Base is one of
the Soviet Northern Fleet's main facilities for servicing nuclear
submarines. [The naval base had a considerably decreased budget in the
1990s and early 2000s and the population of the ZATO diminished from
5,032 in the 2002 Census to 2,171 in the 2010 Census. It has been
severely affected by the economic crisis where civil budgets of
neighbouring administrative units had to fund military personnel and
infrastructure (Hønneland & Jørgensen, 1998). At present, the ZATO
experiences difficulties in receiving regular food supplies due to its
island location and is dependent on small‐scale privately‐arranged
deliveries from the coast, that often consist of poached reindeer meat
(Konstantinov, 2023). I have collected multiple stories about
large‐scale poaching of reindeer by personnel from the military base and
town]{.underline}. "Voiaki s'eli stado" ("military ate up the herd") is
an often‐repeated phrase in interviews. Most severely affected are
animals grazing near the base or accessible by military transport in the
summer or snow scooters in the winter. Military personnel reportedly not
only use the meat for subsistence but also sell it in nearby cities. The
climax of poaching on the herd of Brigade 9 took place in the period
between 2002 and 2007. In the winter of 2001, I observed Brigade 9
corral a herd far exceeding 2,000 animals, at that time the largest in
Cooperative Tundra. By the winter of 2008, the herd was not readily
gathered and its number remained uncertain, but was lower than 1,000
according to the brigade leader. At present, the brigade herd is
extinctIn this section, I show how nuclear contamination as an essential
but less visible part of militarization, determines social relations and
spatial practices and eventually becomes materialized. Sources of
nuclear pollution are decommissioned nuclear‐powered submarines, large
amounts of spent nuclear fuel, liquid and solid radioactive waste in
storage along the coast, the civil nuclear‐powered ice‐breaker fleet,
sunken reactors, and accidents, such as the Kursk disaster in 2000, and
finally the Kola nuclear power plant (Baklanov & Bergman, 1999).
Scholars assert that present contamination on land mainly reflects the
contributions from testing on Novaya Zemlya and transfer from sources
outside the region by the Atlantic currents, discharges from the nuclear
installations in Siberia (Chelyabinsk, Tomsk, and Krasnoyarsk) into the
Siberian rivers, and radioactive deposition from Chernobyl (Hanaček &
Martinez‐Alier, 2022). Officially reported levels of radiation do not
exceed the norms (Bergman, 2001), but territories around military bases
can be heavily polluted and constitute a danger to human health (Hanaček
& Martinez‐Alier, 2022). In 1982, 700 tons of water containing highly
radioactive elements were released into the Barents Sea at Andreevo Bay.
[**Social scientists have so far ignored how Indigenous communities in
the Russian Arctic have been affected by** what Kuletz (2001) calls
"**state sanctioned violence" to the environment and people in the
vicinity of nuclear and militarized landscapes**]{.underline}. The
concept of nuclearism captures the value shift of militarization where
humanitarian objectives and suffering of living subjects, human and
animal, are deemed insignificant against the values of war. In her
research with Indigenous people in America, Kuletz (2001) describes
nuclearism as a colonial project, "unofficial internal colonialism":
nuclearism and **[militarization]{.underline}** have contributed to the
preservation of colonial domination over Indigenous peoples in the era
of alleged decolonization. Military installations and nuclear weapon
production and testing tend to be located in territories popularly seen
as expansive and empty with little population, like deserts, oceans, and
tundra. Those "landscapes of vastness" are the domains of 20th‐century
nuclear colonialism: "The violence of militarized and nuclear landscapes
are some of the most extreme in the world today---invisible, hidden,
unnoticeable for most people---low public profile and high insider's
(government) profile" (Kuletz, 2001, p. 241). These insights are
grounded in testimonies and critical voices of the victims of
nuclearism, native

### Militarization Link

#### Militarization of the Arctic undermines Sámi security and accelerates settler colonialism

Laura **Junka-Aikio 25,** 2025-06-12, Professor of Northern Politics and
Government at the University of Lapland and researcher at the Tromsø
University Museum, University of Tromsø / The Arctic University of
Norway, \"Decolonising Arctic geopolitics and security: Subaltern
security dilemmas of the Sámi in times of the green transition and
militarisation of the Arctic\", Nordic Review of International Studies,
https://nris.journal.fi/article/view/156181

The ongoing Sámi resistance against green colonialism has contributed to
a paradigm shift from the green to just green transition in Arctic
social sciences. Meanwhile, another large change[,
[remilitarisation]{.mark} and [securitisation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} region, has gone largely unaddressed despite the fact
that it, too, has a potentially very **large [impact on land
use]{.mark}** and [regional development]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline} The change is [**p[articularly visible]{.mark}**
[in Sápmi]{.mark} and the northernmost parts of [Norway, Sweden and
Finlan]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark}, whose geopolitical positioning
has shifted drastically in the context of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Especially following Sweden and Finland's NATO memberships and
the Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCAs) with the US, this area has
become a [hot spot of military training and build-up]{.underline}. [From
the **US and NATO [military points of view]{.mark}**, the Nordic
cross-border [region]{.mark} now forms one single area of operation that
**[has high strategic value]{.mark}**, not only due to its vicinity to
Russia but also by virtue of its Northern and Arctic dimensions. Rather
than peripheric borderlands of the Nordic nation-states, Sápmi and the
Nordic High North is at the heart of the "global Artic" that
**[is]{.mark} thoroughly [immersed in global flows and
tensions]{.mark}** and [subject]{.mark} [to]{.mark} considerable
[extractive interest]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Finger and Rekvig eds.,
2022). Militarisation is commonly defined as the material and discursive
process whereby a society organises itself ideologically and materially
around the idea of war as a way of protecting its sovereignty and
security (e.g., Vastapuu et al., 2024; Lutz, 2002). A decolonial
perspective on militarisation centres attention especially on military
land use (Junka-Aikio, 2024a; 2024b). [**[Military land use]{.mark}**
can mean, for instance, **construction of [military bases and barracks,
radar stations]{.mark}, weapons [storage facilities]{.mark}, and using
land or fencing it off for the purpose of military
training**]{.underline}. More widely, military land use also includes
roads, railways, airports and harbours that are needed for the movement
of troops or for the security of supply, or population centres and
settlements that emerge in response to the housing and service needs of
militaries. Rather than merely serving militaries, military land use has
far-reaching impacts on society and the environment. Accordingly,
geographer Rachel Woodward (2004) speaks about military geographies to
highlight its role in shaping societies through spatial organisation.
Military geographies produce certain kinds of spaces, places,
environments, landscapes, connections and chains, facilitating
particular subjects, futures and forms of regional development while
overriding others. [Historically, [military geographies are]{.mark}
deeply [entangled with **colonialism and
imperialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the Arctic, [the connection was
[particularly **clear during**]{.mark} **the [Cold War]{.mark}** which
[turned]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} [into]{.mark} a [hot spot of]{.mark}
the [nuc]{.mark}lear [arms]{.mark} [race]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Vladimirova, 2024; Bernauer, 2018; Lockenbauer and Farrish, 2007). For
instance, in Arctic Canada, Indigenous lands that, until then, had
remained beyond solid state control due to the cold and demanding
environment were territorialised as sites of military training and
preparation through massive investment in transport infrastructures such
as the Alaska Highway, the network of airports serving the Canadian and
Alaskan military forces, and an extensive system of radar stations
(Distant Early Warning Line, DEW). These infrastructures brought large
numbers of settlers to the region, resulting in the establishment of new
population centres across Indigenous lands. [**[Noise and
pollution]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} [military]{.mark} training and
low-flying aircraft **[disturbed people and animals, over-hunting and
fishing became issues, and new livelihoods challenged traditional
ones]{.mark}**. Although some of the infrastructure has, since then,
become a lifeline for the region's Indigenous communities, at the time,
they **[drove settler colonial land appropriation and
assimilation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bernauer, 2018; Lockenbauer and
Farrish, 2007). Today, Sápmi and the Nordic High North exist at the
centre of Arctic military geographies. The change is most visible in the
arrival of foreign troops and a steep increase in large international
military exercises that are organised across civilian and
civilian-military areas. In Northern Finland, international interest in
military training is currently so high that it cannot be met, according
to the Finnish Defence Forces (De Fresnes and Martikainen, 2023).
Militaries consider Northern Finland particularly attractive because of
its supposed "emptiness" and due to the Arctic environment, which allows
training for Arctic warfare (Junka-Aikio, 2024a; 2024b; De Fresnes and
Martikainen, 2023). In local Finnish and national media, the massive
increase in military training and presence has so far been represented
mainly in highly positive terms. Militaries are expected to bring
economic opportunities and investments and boost regional development
(Pylkkänen, 2023; Lapin Kansa, 2024).Rarely discussed, however, is what
kind of development militarisation brings to the Northern regions, for
whom, and at what cost. [What is the impact of these new military
geographies on the environment and on traditional livelihoods, and how
does the arrival of troops affect local life?]{.underline} Likewise,
missing from public debate is the fact that much of the training takes
place in Sápmi., where the Nordic states have a responsibility under
national legislation and international law to respect Sámi Indigenous
rights and self-determination, and to negotiate with the Sámi on any
land use that may have a considerable impact on Sámi culture and
livelihoods.Although few people in the Nordics, the Sámi included,
currently dispute the need to strengthen military defence, the Sámi
Parliaments and the Saami Council have already expressed concern over
militarisation's broader impact on Sámi rights and culture. The UNDRIP
Article 30 particularly cautions against the military use of Indigenous
lands without proper consultation, and there are growing worries,
especially among Sámi reindeer herders, over the damage that extensive
military training, noise, traffic and installations cause to reindeer
pastures, reindeer work, and reindeer wellbeing (Junka-Aikio, 2024b[).
Unless these concerns are properly addressed, there is a **[great chance
that]{.mark} the ongoing [efforts to boost national security]{.mark} end
up [produc]{.mark}ing [significant insecurity]{.mark}** for the
Sámi.Whether the Nordic states and Defence Forces understand their legal
responsibilities to the Sámi]{.underline}, and whether they are ready to
apply them in the present context of strong military alliances, is a
question that merits close attention. [[For instance,]{.mark}
[Finland's]{.mark} Defence Cooperation Agreement ([DCA]{.mark})
[with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates was [drafted
in]{.mark} **complete [secrecy]{.mark} and [without hearing]{.mark} the
[Sámi]{.mark} at al**l, [despite]{.mark} the Agreement also
**[designating]{.mark} an [area]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the [Sámi
homeland]{.mark} region** (Ivalo Border Guard Base**[) for US]{.mark}
use**]{.underline}. Like anyone else, representatives of the Sámi
Parliament learned about the Agreement's contents for the first time
from the news a couple of days before the Agreement was signed (Paltto,
2024). In addition to an increase in military training and presence,
militarisation reshapes land use on the level of transport and other
infrastructures, which are planned increasingly in response to the
stated interests of military defence and security, rather than a broader
vision of regional social and economic development and future.

#### Arctic defense is rooted in colonialism and prioritizes the state over individuals

**Gricius '22** Gabriella Gricius, Senior Fellow at The Arctic
Institute, 9-13-2022, \"Neo-Colonial Security Policies in the Arctic\",
Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/neo-colonial-security-policies-arctic/

Security policies across the United States, Canada, and Norway

In contrast to its allies Canada and Norway, the United States is very
much a late player to the Arctic security table. Most current [[U.S.
Arctic **security policies**]{.underline}]{.mark} have been published
since 2019. However, the vast array of policies [across all areas of
their government points towards a distinct [focus on national
state-based security]{.mark}.]{.underline}1) [What they all
[have]{.mark} in common is an overarching [emphasis on **threats**
coming from **Russia** and **China** -- more broadly, nation state
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline} While some documents address broader
trends such as climate change and how that is making the Arctic more
navigable -- it is discussed in the context of this competition. In Blue
Arctic -- the US Navy's Strategic Blueprint (2021), for example, second
paragraph of the introduction opens the document by claiming:

"In the decades ahead, rapidly melting sea ice and increasingly
navigable Arctic waters -- a Blue Arctic -- will create new challenges
and opportunities off our northern shores. Without sustained American
naval presence and partnerships in the Arctic region, peace and
prosperity will be increasingly challenged by Russia and China, whose
interests and values differ dramatically from ours."

Thus, in many ways, [[this]{.mark} type of Arctic security approach
takes bigger questions of global geopolitical competition and focuses on
the Arctic]{.underline} as one theater of many. What is easy to miss
without considering the role that colonial thinking plays in these
policies is that the [American [approach to the Arctic is founded on
ideas of state security rather than the **security of
individuals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is [[hardly]{.mark} any
[mention]{.mark} of [increasing **food insecurity**]{.mark} of Americans
in Alaska throughout these documents, [nor]{.mark} do the documents
touch on questions of **[permafrost]{.mark}**2) [and **infrastructure**
concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the [United States is certainly
not alone in this privileging of Western conceptions of
security]{.underline}.

[[Canada]{.mark} takes a very different approach to Arctic security,
although in [some ways]{.mark} quite [like the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. In 2010, for example, Canada's Arctic
Foreign Policy adopted a traditional sovereignty approach that [focused
on protecting their borders]{.underline}. However, after much
negotiation and collaboration, the [Trudeau government established [the
**Arctic and Northern Policy Framework**]{.mark} in
2019.]{.underline}3) This framework takes a much different approach to
security. Rather than the traditional state-based security of the United
States, [the framework more broadly [defines security as
including]{.mark}, for example, [access to health, energy, and
education,]{.mark}]{.underline} with statements such as "Canadian
leadership will be advanced bilaterally and in multilateral forums in
order to promote Canadian values and interests such as human and
environmental security" with large portions of the document dedicated to
food and energy security.

It additionally includes statements touching on the longstanding impacts
of colonialism in the Arctic and climate change as a serious national
security threat. However, according to commentators, the framework [--
while it may use the right language -- [doesn't]{.mark} fundamentally
[change how Canada act]{.mark}s in the Arctic in terms to its
security]{.underline}. According to Rob Huebert, for example, the
Trudeau policy is "nothing new."4) [In [similar]{.mark} fashion
[to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [security]{.mark} is
thought of [in this policy]{.mark} as something that [is obtained for
the state]{.mark} and [individual security is]{.mark} framed through
achieving [**economic safety** rather than]{.mark} through
[prioritizing]{.mark} the [security of **Indigenous**]{.mark} or local
[**values and needs**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Norway has a relatively similar approach to Canada when it comes to its
Arctic Policy, published in 2021.5) There is a focus on cooperation and
climate change as the two main pillars through which the Norwegian
government frames its security, with the document opening with the two
sentences: "Norway's Arctic policy revolves around security, stability,
and interest-based international cooperation. For us, foreign and
domestic policy converge in the Arctic." Rather than looking at it
through a lens of geopolitical competition, much of the policy focuses
on domestic issues such as economic growth, future-oriented jobs, and
the societal security of Indigenous communities such as the Sami.
However, it does recognize Russia's military buildup in the region and
points to NATO as one key for maintaining security. What some Indigenous
commentators note, regardless, is that in using Western ideas of
security and progress, Norway may promote ideas of green
colonialism.6) Green colonialism is defined as programs that promote
'green' development but that often comes at the expense of people living
in areas, for example, that see massive construction of wind farms. In
Norway, for example, the Sami have protested against wind farm
development7) because it not only infringes on their territory but also
threatens their livelihood because it disturbs reindeer populations that
they rely on for food and societal security.

What that misses

When [these state-level security policies aren't put into the broader
context of colonialism]{.underline}, any type of analysis [misses the
type of consequences that such policies have on]{.underline}
residential, particularly [Indigenous, Arctic residents]{.underline}.
For example, the U.S. and [Canadian Arctic security policies have often
prioritized economic and national security needs over the needs of
people, putting Arctic residents at harm -- making a conscious decision
to put the needs of the economy over the needs of people. [**Residential
schools** across Canada and in Alaska were]{.mark} often [rationalized
by claiming that Indigenous youth would **suffer** from a **lack of
economic prosperity** unless they were **helped by Western
society**]{.mark}. The implication [relies]{.mark} heavily [on the idea
that Western economic ideas of security were more important than the
needs of Indigenous children **to grow up with their cultures and
families**.]{.mark} It also had the dual [impact of forcing these
children to **assimilate** -- many times violently -- into Western
culture.]{.mark}]{.underline}

More broadly, past [[security strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} from
national governments [have often [ignore]{.mark}d the role of [**climate
change** as a security threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, these
[policies have [focus]{.mark}ed [on]{.mark}]{.underline} national
state-level security issues such as [interstate [conflict or]{.mark}
transnational [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} that originate from
terrorism. While these decisions have been framed as neutral and the
best-suited for the times, they are certainly not neutral. [Patterns of
[thinking from]{.mark} [colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
the idea that humanity can and should conquer nature, [has led to a way
of thinking that [deprioritizes the environment]{.mark} as a source of
any security concerns.]{.underline} Today that is changing -- with many
governments addressing climate change as an existential threat in the
Arctic, However, even with this acknowledgement, the only solutions that
are proposed are technocratic and solely reinforce neoliberalism rather
than a more ecological approach to security. Moreover[, none recognize
the role that colonialism itself has had in [exacerbating climate
change]{.mark} as a phenomenon]{.underline}.

On a local level, and where the influence of [[colonialism]{.mark} is
the most insidious is how national [security policies focus on questions
of state]{.mark}, economic]{.underline} and in some cases climate,
security [[but ignore local]{.mark}-level insecurities such as
[food]{.mark} insecurity [and **societal
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [notable [across]{.mark} the
[U.S. security documents]{.mark} as [there i]{.mark}s clear
[ev]{.mark}idence [that climate change]{.mark} is having consequential
[impacts]{.mark} on [Indigenous communities' ability to find their
traditional sources of food, and]{.mark} their ability to
[maintain]{.mark} their [societal resiliency]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Melting permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} [is even [forc]{.mark}ing some
[communities to]{.mark} [move]{.mark} their entire towns inland in what
is known as managed retreat.]{.underline}8) Choosing what to prioritize
in a security document is by no means neutral, and by [leaving out
questions of these local-level existential security threats instead to
focus on the threat of Russia and China, these policies often imply what
they find important]{.underline}.

Thus, a history of colonialism matters when considering questions of
security in the Arctic today, both in the [policies that are made by
states as well as the types of [security]{.mark} that are conceptualized
and prioritized.]{.underline} Their legacies influence how security
policy is formulated, what priorities are focused on, and what
populations matter. Rather than considering these policies and
approaches to Arctic security as neutral, we should instead think about
them within the broader historical context and [acknowledge how deeply
[rooted]{.mark} they are [in colonial legacies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Arctic Council Link

#### The Arctic Council is rooted in colonial narratives

Perhaps the most recent significant period of US active engagement with
the Arctic was from 2015 to 2017 when it hosted the chairmanship of the
Arctic Council. At first glance[[, the US chairmanship appeared to move
towards a more inclusive perspective]{.mark} with its theme of 'One
Arctic: Shared Opportunities, Challenges, and Responsibilities', [but
**neocolonial narratives** continued]{.mark} to play a role.
[The]{.mark} United States' [three lines of focus]{.mark} within the
Arctic Council [were]{.mark} 1) [strengthen]{.mark}ing [international
coop]{.mark}eration, 2) [steer]{.mark}ing [the Arctic in the right
directio]{.mark}n, and 3) [promot]{.mark}ing **[security]{.mark}**
interests]{.underline} by safeguarding peace and considering science and
traditional knowledge (Hossain & Barala, 2017). The mention of
traditional knowledge is notable. Nonetheless[, a decolonial lens
immediately brings attention to [the idea of **'right
direction**]{.mark}.' Who decides what is the right direction? Who is
involved in that decision? Given that the US interest in the Arctic was
and is driven by both **security and commercial needs**, it [suggests
that]{.mark} many of the people living in the Arctic, such as
[Indigenous peoples, do not]{.mark} actually [play a]{.mark} significant
[role]{.mark} in these decisions.]{.underline} Here, we can see domestic
sovereignty at play with the United States exerting its control over
territory and people by promoting infrastructure and resources
development[. By **excluding** the involvement of Indigenous peoples in
the development of this Arctic security policy, social and political
hierarchies [place only **Western states at the forefront**]{.mark} of
decision-making.]{.underline} One of the other hallmarks of the US
chairmanship of the Arctic Council was its drive to improve economic and
living conditions of Arctic residents by creating a Water Resources
Vulnerability Index. While this does aim to help individuals living in
the Arctic, it also creates an explicit numeric scale that places those
without a Western perceived need in an 'othering' position. All of this
is not to say that the United States did not have many notable successes
in the Arctic Council. The United States worked on and concluded many
legally binding agreements on Arctic maritime cooperation, improved
cooperation, responded to black carbon pollution, and addressed marine
diversity (Hossain & Barala, 2017). Nonetheless, much of its success
relied on reproducing hierarchies that consistently marginalized the
voices of Indigenous peoples and served only to place Western states'
needs and wants on top. Policy documents that date after or during 2016
paint a much different picture of Arctic security from a domestic lens.
The Department of Defense's [[2016 Arctic Strategy only references
Indigenous people three times]{.mark} throughout the entire
document]{.underline}. It instead focuses on state threats, particularly
from Russia, and the continued policy of the US to preserve the freedom
of the seas. [In this policy, [the US is]{.mark} clearly [expressing
**Westphalian sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline} through
non-interference in the sea[. [This]{.mark} mode of expressing
sovereignty **[reinforces political hierarchies]{.mark}** that the US
has created as the hegemon to propagate Western values and
ideology.]{.underline} In 2018, more attention began to be paid to the
Arctic as Russian militarization and Chinese interest began to worry
American policymakers. That year[, the US Navy announced that it would
reestablish the 2nd fleet, citing Russia as the primary concern for the
new force]{.underline} (Larter, 2019). The 2nd fleet, according to the
Navy, would respond to high-end naval warfare in the Atlantic[. [The
choice to reestablish the 2nd fleet]{.underline}]{.mark} [is a
particularly interesting one using a decolonial lens, because it
refocuses attention [towards how the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[felt]{.mark} that [they needed to]{.mark} arrange for a fleet to
essentially [monitor the Arctic against]{.mark} unwelcome [advances that
threatened a Western-centric order]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United
States does not have traditional sovereignty over most of the Arctic
Ocean but felt it had the right to protect the freedom of the seas under
the auspices of that order. This aggression from the United States stems
from both Westphalian and domestic sovereignty. Interestingly, the
United States extended its version of Westphalian sovereignty as a way
of claiming that no non Western state should interfere in the Arctic in
ways that Western practices that enforce a multilateral legal order deem
problematic.

#### Arctic Council Fails, Nations Ignore Native groups

It is important to note that such [[set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialist

#### **The arctic council oppresses and excludes the indigenous peoples.**

Nicholas **Parlato 22**, interdisciplinary PhD candidate, Arctic and
Northern Studies, Nov 8, 2022, "Re-envisioning the Arctic Council",
East-West Center,
https://www.eastwestcenter.org/news/web-article/re-envisioning-arctic-council

FAIRBANKS (Nov. 8, 2022) \-- In 2017, Dalee Sambo Dorough, Chair of the
Inuit Circumpolar Council, pointed out that the Ottawa Declaration, the
founding document of [the [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil, explicitly
[declares]{.mark}]{.underline} in a footnote that [the term peoples
"shall not be construed as having any implications as regard the rights
which may attach to the term under international law.]{.underline}" In
other words, I[ndigenous Permanent Participants]{.underline}, or
[[IPPs]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the Council [[**cannot**
act]{.underline}]{.mark} from the position of [[self-determining and
sovereign]{.mark} peoples]{.underline} as enshrined in the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Labor
Organization Convention 169.\[i\]

Recognizing the political validity of peoples, Dorough suggested, would
better fulfill the Arctic Council's mandate to support Arctic Indigenous
Peoples in receiving an equal seat at the table in the event of future
reform or restructuring of the Council. Even for an organization as
young as the Council, however, her suggestion to revisit its founding
documents in light of emerging political realities lands far afield of
the consensus on the adequacy and appropriateness of Arctic Council
structure. [Still]{.mark}, many have noted that the balance, if not the
structure, of [[the Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is indeed already
changing, with 38 Observers (13 states, 13 intergovernmental
organizations, and 12 NGOs) today [[outnumber]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[IPP]{.mark} [rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entatives [by]{.mark} a [factor
of]{.mark} nearly [five]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Power imbalance\
IPPs spearheaded efforts between 2008 and 2013 to strictly define and
delimit the role played by non-Arctic Observers, resulting in the
Observer Manual for Subsidiary Bodies, but the right of often
well-resourced Observers to invest in working groups and co-lead
projects remains an evolving source of power imbalance.\[ii\] Such
Observers have expressed interest in enhancing their role in the Arctic
Council, but IPPs have expressed concern over the potential impacts on
their rights,\[iii\] noting that [[only 16 of the Council's 90
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2019 [f[eatured an IPP
co-lead]{.mark}]{.underline}. The recent pause in Council activities
stemming from Russia's military assault on Ukraine should prompt leaders
to address this and other Indigenous concerns as the Arctic Council
determines its future structure and function.

The category of IPP in the Arctic Council is enshrined in the Ottawa
Declaration "to provide for active participation and full consultation
with the Arctic indigenous representatives within the Arctic Council."
Indeed, many Arctic Indigenous leaders have rightfully praised the
comparatively progressive nature of this arrangement, noting the open
and consequential communication it facilitates between IPPs and Member
States. Andrew Chater points out that the status of Permanent
Participants, as evidenced in Council documents, adheres to this
conservative, mostly benign formulation of participation, but
[[also]{.mark}]{.underline} that IPPs such as the Inuit Circumpolar
Council have publicly signaled their interest in having a more
substantive role.\[iv\]

The fact that [[voting rights]{.underline}]{.mark} remain
[[exclusive]{.underline}]{.mark}ly [[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Member States]{.underline}]{.mark} means that [**[IPPs depend on
them]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only to solicit their opinion, but to
validate and advocate for their perspectives in final negotiations.\[v\]
That the five Arctic coastal [[states are also able to conclude
agreements outside the]{.underline}]{.mark} structure of the
[[Council]{.mark}]{.underline} likewise [demonstrates [an **imbalance of
power**]{.mark} with IPPs]{.underline}.\[vi\]As in nearly all other
major international fora, it is the nation-state actor whose de facto
sovereignty, territorial hegemony, and ability to mobilize resources
qualify it to make decisions.

Integrating Indigenous knowledge with Western research orientations and
methodologies Academic knowledge systems work to construct and replicate
the world they profess to study and describe (Barth, 2002) but are not
inclusive to all epistemologies and ways of knowing (Clement, 2019).
[The knowledge systems of those considered on the margins of society,
especially Indigenous peoples, have often been historically
misinterpreted, devalued, trivialized,]{.underline} and [excluded from
the academic construction of knowledge]{.underline} (Foucault, 1980;
McGuire, 2010). These ways of knowing can be considered "subjugated
knowledges" (Foucault, 1980, p. 81) and are seen as "epistemic\[ally\]
inferior" (Grosfoguel, 2013, p. 74) to the dominant Western knowledge
paradigm partially because "most of the 'traditional' disciplines are
grounded in cultural world views which are either antagonistic to other
belief systems or have no methodology for dealing with other knowledge
systems" (L. T. Smith, 2012, p. 68[). For Indigenous peoples,
colonialism has been a pervasive factor in this process of exclusion and
dominates the mental universe of the colonized]{.underline} (McGuire,
2010; Wa Thiong'o, 1986), and even social justice--[minded scholars
often ignore issues of Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline} (Ardill,
2013). Thus, recent scholars have considered how dominant [Western
research methodologies should be decolonized because for many Indigenous
peoples, "the term 'research' is inextricably linked to European
imperialism and colonialism"]{.underline} (L. T. Smith, 2012, p. 1).
Decolonization involves deconstructing colonialist practices in
institutional structures and unveiling the mindset of those who enact
these practices (Ashcroft et al., 2000; Balestrery, 2012), as well as
relegating power to historically colonized groups. [Omitting Indigenous
perspectives]{.underline} from the research process [maintains
oppression]{.underline} (Stone, 2002). Therefore, non-Indigenous and
Indigenous researchers who work with Indigenous communities have argued
[there is an urgent need to include Indigenous voices and ways of
knowing]{.underline} into the public health research process (Bartlett
et al., 2007; Cochran et al., 2008; Held et al., 2019; Simonds &
Christopher, 2013[). Incorporating Indigenous knowledge
into]{.underline} health [research can rebalance power between academics
and communities and create better science through decolonizing
approaches]{.underline} (Denzin et al., 2008; Dickerson et al., 2020).
Non-Indigenous and Indigenous researchers working in partnership have
called for research methodologies that "encompass cultural contexts" of
AIs, AN, and Native Hawaiians in health promotion interventions
(Dickerson et al., 2020, p. 1), develop culturally grounded health
promotion interventions (Walters et al., 2020), utilize Indigenous
research principles (Ninomiya & Pollock, 2017), apply research
approaches like CBPR to build tribal capacity (Jernigan et al., 2015),
and focus on a strength-based approach that simultaneously builds trust
(Rink, Bird, et al., 2016)) and empowers families and communities
(Lambert, 2013; Rink, Bird, et al., 2016). Indigenous knowledge and
epistemologies represent a diversity of cultural practices, but some
general characteristics are consistent across Indigenous communities.
[Indigenous knowledge "includes a deep belief in the connectedness of
all creation across time and space, with relationships between past,
present, and future entities"]{.underline} (Walters et al., 2020, p. 3).
[Indigenous knowledge tends to incorporate holist,
contextualist---versus reductionistic, spiritually and socially
focused---versus biomedical, strengths-focused---as opposed to
problem-focused, and relational---as opposed to intrapsychic,
approaches]{.underline} (Cajete, 2014; Wendt et al., 2019). The
diversity of Indigenous ways of knowing has often been deliberately
excluded and silenced from Western knowledge systems, however inclusive
they currently attempt to be, [because holistic ways of knowing and
ceremony do not necessarily fit into the way Western knowledge is
corroborated and validated. The West has imposed a "positional
superiority" in the production and diffusion of knowledge since the
Enlightenment that typically excludes other worldviews]{.underline}
(Clement, 2019, p. 277; Said, 1978/2006). Research from the perspective
of the dominant Western---and largely White---paradigm does not
adequately address the cultural norms and values related to social
science research in Indigenous communities. [One way to integrate
Indigenous voices into public health interventions involves positioning
local meanings directly into the fabric of the research
design.]{.underline} [Tribal language, context, underlying value
assumptions, emphases on story-telling as a valid way of communicating
knowledge]{.underline} (Simonds & Christopher, 2013), and group meanings
must be important considerations in the crafting of survey, interview,
or focus group questions. [Moreover, an Indigenous cultural identity
alongside social support may be a protective factor against outcomes
such as substance use, depression, and risky sexual behavior for AI
youth]{.underline} (Baldwin et al., 2011[). As a Western epistemology
constructed using Western knowledge claims, intersectionality is still
rooted in a traditional Western research that has oppressed AIs for
centuries, discounts Indigenous ways of knowing, and ignores a history
of colonial trauma. We argue that decolonizing social science research
related to AI health involves integrating an Indigenous standpoint at
the outset of the research design, within instruments, during
implementation and must include Indigenous authority over the research
findings.]{.underline} For example, tribal Community Advisory Boards
(CABs) and Institutional Review Boards may supervise the research
process from start to finish. [Privileging an Indigenous standpoint and
sovereignty may thus work to combat colonialist knowledge claims and
reduce health disparities in Indigenous communities. Ensuring benefits
of research for AI communities According to Foley (2003), IST maintains
that any benefits of research with Indigenous communities should remain
within those Indigenous communities and asserts that Indigenous
researchers must be supervisors who are directly involved in the
research. Integrating Indigenous community members as full research
partners in social science research enables the science to be both
relevant to the communities and rigorous (Balazs & Morello-Frosch,
2013). Within research approaches such as CBPR, tribal communities have
the authority to control the research process, and any data are owned,
shared with, and returned to the tribes (Wallerstein et al.,
2018]{.underline}). In some cases, tribal institutional review boards
help to ensure that any benefits from the research go to the tribal
communities (Becenti-Pigman et al., 2008). [Community ethics boards can
also help to ensure that researchers adhere to principles of justice and
equitability. In other words, using IST alongside research approaches
such as CBPR aids in decolonizing research by giving the Indigenous
communities ownership and authority over the research process. This
oversight also safeguards against outside researchers seeking to profit
or outside interests forced onto Indigenous communities.]{.underline}
Discussion Health care policies that focus on only one identity such as
gender, without simultaneously focusing on race, culture, and
colonization, are inadequate (Crenshaw et al., 1996; A. Smith, 2003), as
is the focus on Western knowledge theorization and construction. Public
health strategies that do not consider structural violence and power
imbalances in our social system risk evasion of underlying factors
implicated in disease (Shannon et al., 2008). [Simply conducting
research on Indigenous subjects with humanist ideals, rather than
partnering with Indigenous communities, risks replicating structures of
oppression, domination, and "epistemicide" or the extermination of ways
of knowing of marginalized groups]{.underline} (Grosfoguel, 2013, p. 74;
de Sousa Santos, 2016). In short, when the current lived realities of
historical trauma are disregarded in social science research related to
AI health and Indigenous cultural meanings are omitted, interventions
lack context and meaning for intended recipients, which contributes to
ineffective policy or public health interventions and simultaneously
risks further epistemicide.

Personal Reflection:

When did you start to consider decolonization and what brought you to
this thought? What may have caused the delay in considering
decolonization earlier in your life? How do you think colonialism plays
a role in maintaining barriers to decolonial thinking \-- yours or
possibly your community's? Take a few minutes to write your answers to
these questions.

Diving in Part 1: Decolonizing Education & Knowledge Production

[Decolonization can start in many places. This is largely because
colonialism's influence spans across so many different aspects of our
lives. [Capitalism, racism, heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, and
Eurocentric forms of knowledge production are]{.mark} all things that
perpetuate [**colonial power dynamic**s]{.mark}]{.underline} and
structures that determine the distribution of power among people. [By
[deconstructing]{.mark} each of [these aspects]{.mark} of colonialism
\-- among others \-- [we]{.mark} can **[begin to
decolonize]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} very [foundations of our written histories are
colonized]{.mark}. School [textbooks provide a selective retelling of
what happened]{.mark} and why, [often from the]{.mark} sole [perspective
of]{.mark} the [powerholders]{.mark} throughout history: settlers,
colonizers, and even academics. One dimension of **[decolonization is
correcting these partial histories]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In her book
Connected Sociologies, Gurminder Bhambra, a professor of Postcolonial
and Decolonial Studies at the University of Sussex, advocates for
[[correcting]{.mark} partial histories [with a
**deconstruct-reconnect-reconstruct** approach to create a history
that]{.mark} not only [critically examines the role of enslavement and
oppression,]{.mark} but [also gives space to incorporate overlooked
histories]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- the people written out of history,
many of whom had expansive societies before colonization. [The
[reconnect and reconstruct]{.mark} aspects [make an effort to
acknowledge marginalized cultures]{.mark} in their resilience and
complexity beyond their classification as colonized
subjects]{.underline}. Bhambra argues that the reworking of incomplete
histories will help us destabilize Western/European exceptionalism and
dominance and gain a better understanding of the world from multiple
perspectives. [[Looking]{.mark} back [to understand the globe and vastly
different cultures on it is also key to creat]{.mark}ing [space
for]{.mark} those [cultures to]{.mark} continue to exist and
[flourish]{.mark}.]{.underline}

in a satirical portrait. Wendy is wearing a Halloween native american
costume and is surrounded by an inflatable deer in front of an
artificial background of a prairie.

Image: Wendy Red Star (Apsáalooke Crow) created the artwork titled
"Fall" (2006) to poke fun at colonial misrepresentations of Indigenous
history which often memorializes Indigenous people in the past without
recognizing contemporary Indigeneity and ongoing resilience. Red Star
uses an inflatable deer, Halloween store costume, and artificial
backdrop to respond to the stereotypical depiction of Indigenous people
in art and museum displays.

In our conversation on filling the historical gaps, [it is important to
understand that [knowledge, science, and data are not "discovered" or
"found," but created and co-constructed]{.mark}. We can ask ourselves
about the knowledge we encounter. Who created it? Who does it benefit?
How is it prioritized (or not prioritized)? [Colonial efforts]{.mark}
from Western and European nations often [work to manage]{.mark} what
counts as [knowledge]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [science, controlling and
dominating knowledge production]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Using Southern
Theory, sociologist Raewyn Connell argues that this monopoly results in
knowledge that is homogenous, standardized, and limited in diversity.
This power dynamic limits different cultures' capabilities to contribute
their unique and legitimate knowledges. By questioning the selective
nature of academia we can reprioritize cultural and scientific
knowledge, expanding its possibilities.

In the following 7 minute video, Dr. Lwazi Lushaba breaks down what it
means to decolonize education by using post-apartheid South Africa as an
example. As a lecturer at the University of Cape Town, he studies
decolonial thought and politics. In this video, he discusses the
necessity of incorporating different cultural wealth into our teachings
of knowledge and science in education. Note his call that "\[t\]here is
no discipline that is immune from this task of decolonization."

Decolonised Education Explained in Simple Terms

Personal Reflection:

Are you aware of how colonial thinking intersects with and informs your
field of study? How might you learn more about that topic?

Diving in Part 2: Is removing Indigenous imagery decolonization?

In recent years, there has been a cultural reckoning around the use of
Native American imagery in society. Sports teams, consumer brands,
universities and more have made several high-profile moves to remove
Indigenous names, images, and references from their logos, packaging,
buildings and marketing.

Not Your Mascot: Native Americans and Team Mascots

The initiatives to remove Indigenous imagery have been undertaken by
Indigenous activists and students and in many cases have been years in
the making. That these images were (and still are) used is indicative of
the colonial project to erase Indigenous people and replace them with
racialized, imaginative depictions for exploitative means. However,
while the removal of this imagery is perceived by many as progress,
others, such as prominent Comanche author Paul Chaat Smith comments:
"one wishes for an alternative besides stereotype or erasure." Indeed -
many of the brands which have changed or dropped objectifying Indigenous
language from their brandings have only done so under threat of
financial loss. Seen from this lens, these initiatives have failed the
decolonization movement by focusing on settler moves to innocence \--
the action of removing imagery not to benefit Indigenous people, but to
affect the settler's financial bottom line. Put simply \-- these efforts
are not enough. All control of Indigenous identity should come directly
from Indigenous communities.

Reflection Activity:

Did you know that there is a long history of using Indigenous imagery
for the profit motive, a prevailing notion that "Big Chief can Sell
Anything"? In addition to the contemporary uses that we covered above,
you can learn about settlers' historical monetization of Indigenous
identity and imagery through this Smithsonian museum virtual exhibit:
"Americans". Take a few moments to click around the different examples
and view the articles at the bottom of the page.

Diving in Part 3: Critiquing Action

[[Decolonial action]{.mark} requires discomfort. It [requires settlers
to]{.mark} truly [come to terms with]{.mark} our shared [colonial
history and how we continue to benefit from it]{.mark}. It [requires
settlers to realize that we will need to give up some]{.mark} of our own
[comforts]{.mark} in the name of creating more just, sustainable and
equitable communities. Not all decolonial action is equal or
helpful.]{.underline} Land acknowledgements, which are meant to pay
tribute to the Indigenous people traditionally from the region (and
often carried out before a public event), can easily become
performative, empty acts if not done in a thoughtful way or followed up
with tangible action such as supporting Indigenous communities with
financial donations. Other movements that lack Indigenous
representation, fail to center Indigenous people, or result in no
tangible change serve as poor attempts at decolonization. Such acts of
fake decolonization abound to the detriment of the movement's goals.
When considering the merits of a proposed decolonial action, examine it
in the light of this non-exhaustive list of questions:

Does the decolonization effort, initiative, or movement involve input
and continued representation from Indigenous people?

Does the effort provide resources to Indigenous people?

Does the effort replicate colonial relationships and power structures?

Is the effort a one-time, short-term initiative? If so, is there a plan
for new or continued efforts beyond this initial step?

In response to the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in
Standing Rock, North Dakota in 2016, writers Berkley Carnine and Liza
Minno Bloom created a list of actions that one can start with in working
towards decolonization. Read through their list and approach it with the
above questions: How to Support Standing Rock and confront what it means

#### Indigenous populations of the Arctic have historically contributed to high north security.

[Arctic Indigenous people have **historical roots** in supporting the
security and safety within the Arctic. The knowledge on what looks
right, understanding the unique Arctic climate, and being skilled to
traverse difficult terrain in challenging conditions are relevant
knowledge and skills that must be integrated into future SOF Arctic
deployments]{.underline}. Indigenous knowledge is essential for US troop
deployments aimed at securing the most northern borders of North
America. [More so in Alaska and Canada, many Indigenous people take
**exceptional pride** in their respective countries' armed services. In
the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives have been the
leading minority groups to join the armed serves per capita than any
other demographic group]{.underline}. Both Alaska Natives and American
Indians contribute to the volunteer force five times more than any other
demographic group.12 There is precedent for leveraging Indigenous
knowledge for homeland defense purposes. [Alaska Natives and Indigenous
people of Canada have a legacy of being frontline observers having a
watchful eye against hostile incursions into North America since World
War]{.underline} [II.]{.underline}[13]{.underline}

United States

The Alaska Territorial Guard (ATG), more commonly known as the Eskimo
Scouts, was formed during World War II as a military reserve force
component of the US Army. Its organization in 1942 was a response to
Japan's attacks on Hawai\'i and the occupation of parts of Alaska's
Aleutian Chain. The ATG served to identify potential Japanese incursions
in Alaska along the territory's expansive coastline.14 There was some
initial controversy in recruiting and arming Alaska Natives as at the
time there was legal and social segregation by race across Alaska. The
participation of Alaska Natives in the military during World War II,
despite these bitter circumstances, speaks well of the patriotism and
hopefulness of that generation of Alaska Natives. However, the ATG has
since dissolved, and there are no subsequent similar organizations in
Alaska.

Canada

Above 60 degrees North latitude, Canada is sparsely populated and
possesses little infrastructure. The Canadian Rangers, a subcommand of
the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), live and work in remote and isolated
areas, serving as forward observers, of sorts, for the Canadian Arctic.
Mostly comprised of First Nation members, the Canadian Rangers provide
local information on unusual activities and events that may have
military interests.15 [Additionally, local patrols contribute to
domestic efforts led by the CAF, share local knowledge, and perform
search-and-rescue activities **in support of military
operations**.]{.underline} Further, Canadian Rangers provide mentoring
and coaching to the Junior Canadian Ranger Program, which engages local
youth to build skills and knowledge related to the roles the Canadian
Rangers fill.

[The Canadian Rangers model serves as a useful reference point when
considering a **formal Indigenous militarized organization** with an
**active role** in defending the homeland and supporting crisis
response]{.underline}. Although many lessons could be learned from the
Canadian Rangers integration into the CAF's military efforts,
establishing a comparable United States Indigenous force in Alaska with
similar command relationships has inherent challenges. However,
recruiting Alaska Native individuals to join the Alaska National Guard
is one avenue, albeit different. Nonetheless, there are regulatory and
structural limits that constrain the prospect in forming something that
parallels the Canadian Rangers. Budgetary vulnerabilities, political
dynamics, limited resources, and a lack of urgency make such an endeavor
unlikely at this time, either at the state or federal levels.

Greenland/Denmark

The history of Indigenous people formally integrated into Western
military forces in Greenland does not have the same legacy as found in
the United States or Canada. Greenland is an autonomous territory within
the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland relies on the Danes---and a
twentieth-century US-backed treaty---for its defense and security. The
Danish Special Operations Command coordinates the Sirius Dog Sled
Patrols under the auspices of the Danish naval SOF that actively patrols
the northern portions of Greenland six months out of the year as a means
of asserting Danish sovereignty in the Arctic.16 This northern patrol is
the only active and recurring Arctic patrol executed by a special
operations unit among the United States, Canada, and Denmark. Although
the Greenlandic Inuit people make up most of the island's population,
there is no formal force arrangement between Greenland's Indigenous
people and Denmark's military.

Discussion

[US special operators, leaders, and planners are uniquely skilled,
organized, and trained to build and implement a cohesive strategy that
**integrates** native leaders, communities, and elders in support of
defending our homeland.]{.underline} US SOF have long engaged nonstate
actors and societal influencers in overseas security force assistance
and foreign military training operations as an essential element of
cultural assimilation efforts. The same approach can, and should, be
pursued in the United States and Canada between US SOF and Indigenous
peoples. Working with and through Indigenous people is what SOF
do.17 Therefore, [when considering special operations in the High North,
the Arctic Indigenous people **partnered** with national SOF would
improve northern security and offer a unique resource for safety in the
remote and isolated Arctic region.]{.underline}

Integration of SOF and Indigenous peoples in North America will be
different than it has been for overseas special operations.
Unconventional and irregular warfare doctrine orients toward foreign
partners, not Indigenous people who are US, Canadian, or Danish
citizens. National laws influence how SOF might appropriately interact
with Indigenous populations, which can affect knowledge exchange, skills
development, and Indigenous community support. North American Indigenous
peoples are a valuable future partner for collaboration, cooperation,
and learning, but recalibrating the SOF enterprise to work with its own
citizens requires intentional planning and inclusive dialogue with
partners and other stakeholders.

The Way Ahead

[Defending the homeland requires **a unified effort.** The Indigenous
peoples living in the High North have a vested interest in preserving
and reinforcing their sovereignty: economically, politically, and
culturally. SOF is **uniquely poised** to build relationships with
Indigenous people, prepare for operations in remoted and austere
conditions, and indirectly supporting defensive lines of effort with
small units.]{.underline} Simultaneously, though, SOF is still learning
how to conduct sustained operations under North American Arctic
conditions across the varied special operations mission sets. Therefore,
there is a natural alignment---an operational and tactical
imperative---for SOF and Indigenous communities to build and sustain
enduring relationships to improve security and safety in the North
American Arctic.

[Native communities have **contributed to securing** the **homeland**
since World War II.]{.underline} However, to advance the defense of the
homeland in the twenty-first century, a coherent and resourced strategy
must begin with advancing the relationships between SOF and Indigenous
communities. Working with local law enforcement, conducting training and
exercises in the High North, [and learning some of the cultural ways
that have sustained Native people for **thousands of
years**]{.underline} are a few efforts US, Canadian, and Danish SOF
could immediately pursue. By engaging in such activities[, SOF units
operating in the High North will forge productive relationships while
developing essential knowledge and skills for enhanced Arctic
operations. Making and sustaining trust relationships with Indigenous
communities will allow for future opportunities to collaborate and
evolve the relationships.]{.underline} Connecting SOF with Indigenous
communities promotes formalized partnerships in time, thus opening
pathways for improved doctrinal and policy development integrating
SOF--Indigenous relationships. Identifying tensions, co-constructing
collaborative solutions, and learning from those lessons during
peacetime training, exercises, and other shared experiences will
contribute to building trust and enduring relationships.

The relationship established via the Arctic Council between states and
indigenous representatives is unique in diplomacy. While it is usual in
international organizations to create a category of observers, including
[[indigenous groups]{.underline}]{.mark} and non-governmental
organizations, who can come to meetings to advise states, comment on the
proceedings and watch what occurs, [the Permanent Participants [are not
observers. They are an **integral part of the
institution.**]{.mark}]{.underline} That states and the Permanent
Participants sit together as equals in a multilateral organization is
not something found elsewhere.

[The Permanent Participants ("PP's" in Arctic Council parlance) ensure
that the views of the Arctic Indigenous are a vital part of the work of
the Council,]{.underline} providing a more direct and effective
perspective than if the states relied on consultations with their
Indigenous citizens for information and guidance. The PP's also
represent in most cases a cross-section of nationalities, which provides
cross-border perspectives. The Aleut International Association (AIA),
for example, consists of membership in the United States of America and
Russia. The Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) consists of membership in
Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, the United States of America, as well as
Russia. In the current political climate it's important that we
collectively understand there is more than one avenue of diplomacy.

Not everyone appreciates why Indigenous participation is important in a
body like the Arctic Council. One reason is that the Arctic Indigenous
over the centuries have built up knowledge about conditions in the
Arctic and how to thrive there, often in naturally sustainable hunting
and fishing economies, and always in deep connection with nature.
[[Their ancient knowledge is]{.mark} an **[essential]{.mark}** element
[for]{.mark} their continued [survival]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
region, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} their contemporary
[understandings]{.underline} about the changes they've experienced in
the Arctic are [needed for [sound public policies]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the region. After all the Arctic is their homeland,
[[they]{.mark}]{.underline} have human rights and [[are]{.mark} the
**[essential stakeholders]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region, and
often, though not always, comprise the vast majority of the inhabitants
of the area. Thus, [[their participation provides]{.mark} substantial
[value that the gov]{.mark}ernments of the states]{.underline} (national
and subnational) [[don't provide]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The diversity of the Indigenous representation within the Council is
also important. Although many in, and outside, the Arctic think
primarily of maritime matters given the importance of the Arctic Ocean,
many Indigenous live far away from coastal areas. In these inland
communities, their lives focus on non-maritime concerns, including these
days the impacts on infrastructure caused by thawing permafrost,
policies with implications for managing wildfires, the health of rivers
and streams, and the fish that are found there. The Gwich'in live
in-land and provide a perspective that may be different from coastal
Indigenous brethren. The Arctic isn't just about the sea ice or shipping
lanes. Indeed, much of the story of the Arctic can't be told as a
maritime tale; for example, the setting of the Arctic and subarctic
includes the largest forest on planet Earth, the boreal forest.

Indigenous-led Arctic Council Projects, Participation and Impact

Gwich'in Council International has two projects centered on impacts to
the boreal forest from wildland fire within the Arctic Council
currently: one in the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Working
Group (CAFF) and the other in the Emergency Preparedness Prevention and
Response (EPPR) Working Group. Both projects were spurred by the
devastating fires Gwich'in communities, many north of the Arctic Circle,
have already endured. Some 64 percent of the Yukon Flats National
Wildlife Refuge, home to the Gwich'in, have burned since 1960. This is
the third largest wildlife refuge in the United States and is roughly
five times the size of the State of Delaware. This area was established
as a refuge for its unique status as a vast Arctic wetland, with much of
it covering permafrost soils (permanently frozen soil rich in
sequestered greenhouse gases), much of which has been impacted by the
wildfires in the Arctic. Some four Delawares worth of land have burned
within Gwich'in homelands alone.

The Gwich'in projects at the Arctic Council hope to draw attention and
science to the Arctic to better understand the changes to wildfire in
the Arctic and its impacts that they have already seen, as well as to
draw international cooperation and resources to the issue. Northern
latitude forests and Arctic tundra have removed tremendous amounts of
CO2 from the atmosphere over time, and that carbon has been stored
(sequestered) in plants and especially soils. For example, circum-boreal
forests contain more carbon than any other forest types on Earth (1,095
billion tons of carbon), and permafrost soils (found in both northern
boreal and Arctic regions) store up to of 1,580 billion tons of carbon.
To put these amounts into perspective, the carbon stored in permafrost
is twice what is currently in the atmosphere (860 billion tons of
carbon), meaning that permafrost thawing or burning from wildfires could
release that stored carbon back into the atmosphere as the greenhouse
gas CO2, accelerating global warming.

The situation is terrifying and clear: the largest terrestrial stores of
carbon on the planet are flammable, and we have increasingly seen large
mega fires in the north burning millions of acres, and releasing vast
and unquantified amounts of greenhouse gases. In addition, permafrost
regions have historically served as a natural insulator keeping the
sequestered greenhouse gases in soils contained, but, as the Arctic
warms the vast Yukon Flats and other areas in the far north have shown
this is less true now than before. As Gwich'in Council International
have publicly stated their concern, the region has warmed three times as
fast as the rest of the globe, and there is an acute need to better
understand how much of the carbon stored in our northern ecosystems will
be released to the atmosphere, and how fast will this occur given rapid
Arctic change.

[[The A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [is **critical**]{.mark}ly
important for the space it creates **[for Indigenous
perspectives]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and leadership on issues like
wildfire response in the Arctic. [GCI's projects create international
space for cooperation and awareness on critical issues like the
climate]{.underline} driving impacts of wildland fire in the Arctic and
subarctic regions. The CAFF project, Arctic Fire, hopes to expand our
understanding of wildland fire ecology in the Arctic, exploring
Indigenous knowledge on the topic, and creating space for experts around
the circumpolar north to discuss these timely issues. The GCI project at
EPPR, Circumpolar Fire, evaluates the legal frameworks of current
wildfire cooperation between Arctic States and has proposed that new
areas of cooperation and agreements may be warranted in the current
climate of Arctic wildland fire. Naturally, these are only a couple of
the examples of the [[many important projects Arctic Indigenous Peoples
are engaged in]{.mark} at the Arctic Council.]{.underline}

The Indigenous groups also in many cases represent peoples who live in
different countries. The Gwich'in communities are located in both Canada
and in the United States. Thus, t[he perspective of Indigenous
groups]{.underline} can be broader than found in a single nation, and
[can point to new areas of needed bilateral]{.underline} cooperation
between neighboring states that can sometimes be forgotten in southern
capitals. For example, the Indigenous groups have led efforts to focus
on the importance of removing obstacles to travel across borders where
families of particular tribes or groups live in different countries.
Only recently, President Biden and Premier Trudeau recognized the need
to improve conditions for visa-free travel between the United States and
Canada to aid contacts between these families, and it was Indigenous
groups who have pressed for this over many years. The complex nature of
the Jay Treaty and Canadian immigration policy as they affect Indigenous
Peoples are bound by a particular reality: these are one people, one
language, families, who have lived and governed their own areas for tens
of thousands of years, who have been separated by relatively recently
established borders, and they have the right to continue their
relationships.

[[The Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} are close to the land and nature
and [[have a direct understanding of]{.underline}]{.mark} what is going
on in the Arctic, especially [[environmental change which is at the
heart of the issues the Council cares about.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Whether it is intricate changes to sea ice, plant, animal, insect life,
or ecosystem-wide rapid changes like wildfire, [[the Indigenous peoples
are **vested stakeholders** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} who are
keen and longtime observers of the region, and their knowledge is
integral in getting things right for the Arctic.

reflecting the little ambient light there is. [The team conducts its
reconnaissance of the radar site to ensure it is secure and look for

scenario is part of a US **joint military exercise** that is conducted
every two years in Alaska. Native communities **provide resources,
knowledge, and information** to US and Canadian forces developing
capacities to **secure and defend** the North American
Arctic.]{.underline}

[The increased accessibility to natural resources and navigational
routes in the Arctic]{.underline} due to rapid climate changes has
elevated interest, both [domestically and from foreign national states,
such as Russia and China. As a result]{.underline}, the Arctic region
experiences [**increased competition** for resources and access to and
through the Arctic]{.underline} which [has led to **Arctic security
postures.**]{.underline} For the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,
reinforcing rule-based order and maintaining consistent domain awareness
are a couple of the strategic measures to support securing the
Arctic.\[i\] [The people who live in]{.underline} and near [the Arctic
have a vested interest to ensure that all domains]{.underline} (i.e.,
air, land, space, and waters) [are **secured and** sovereignties are
**legitimized**.]{.underline} The Arctic, as a polar region, can be
viewed through different zones (see Figure 1) that does not have a clear
geographical boundary when considering the population within the Arctic.
The subarctic is integral to thinking about the Arctic and those who
live and thrive in the region[. Although the number of Indigenous people
living in the Arctic region is about 10 percent of the total four
million, they are the preponderant inhabitants outside of the few city
centers regionally located. The Indigenous people have legitimate
sovereignty that is internal to recognized Arctic nation-state
governments.\[ii\]]{.underline}

Particularly [within the North American Artic]{.underline}, the United
States, Canada, and Greenland (the Realm of Denmark), [those who live
outside of major population centers predominately identify as Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} The Indigenous population is the highest in the
Canadian Arctic and in Greenland, consisting of more than 75% of the
total population. For Canada, almost half of the 150,000 inhabitants of
Canada's Artic are Indigenous.\[iii\] In the U.S., 84 percent of rural
Alaska are Alaska Native people.\[iv\] The Greenlandic Inuit make up
nearly 90% of Greenland's total population.\[v\] In these remote and
austere lands and coastal regions, [Indigenous people have a vested
interest in ensuring their **way of life**, access to **critical
resources**, and **cultural integrity** are paramount. Given Indigenous
people have **internal sovereignty within nation-state** sovereignties,
there is a shared or common interest between nation-state governments
and Indigenous peoples to **collaborate** and invest in **securing** the
North American Arctic.]{.underline}

Trust Responsibility

[In recent years, efforts have been made by Indigenous leaders
throughout Canada and the U.S. **to solidify and legitimize the
sovereignty of Indigenous Nations**.]{.underline} [Additionally,
measures to **acknowledge** and address some of the **historical
traumas** have been made]{.underline}.\[vi\] Governmental prohibition of
cultural practices, marginalization, and forced acculturation into
western culture are just a few collective efforts to delegitimize Native
people and their claims. However, there have been some measures taken to
reconcile some past traumas.  

For the Alaska Native people[, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act]{.underline} (ANCSA; 1971) was an agreement to settle land claims
levied by Alaska Native communities and organizations. It [resulted
in]{.underline} the formation of a collection of Alaska Native
corporations where [some **financial compensation** (nearly \$1 billion
USD) and **land distributions** (44 million acres) were returned to the
Alaska Native people.]{.underline}\[vii\] As a result, [federally
recognized tribes have the right to request government-to-government
**consultation** on US Department of Defense (DoD) activities that may
have an impact on those tribes.]{.underline} Although not having the
same authorities as tribes, Alaska Native corporations (ANCs) do have
the right to consultation for those resources that such entities are
responsible for. However, they do not have the right, at this time, to
request government-to-government consultation.\[viii\] Given the
imperfections of ANSCA, the act has advanced the legitimacy within a
federal system the Alaska Native people require.  

The Indian Act and the Constitution Act of 1982 are two critical
documents that advance the requirement for reconciliation with and
self-governance by the Indigenous people of Canada.\[ix\] Indigenous
governing bodies have been able to increase their legal authorities
which has, in turn, shaped the interactions between the Canadian Armed
Forces (CAF) and how they train and operate in the most northern
territories and providences. [Training and operating in the Arctic areas
of Canada, the CAF coordinates with **Native-owned businesses** and
governing bodies to coordinate, sustain, and **support military
activities**.]{.underline} Not only does the CAF have the obligation to
coordinate with Native governing bodies but logistical support must be
organic to the region. Otherwise, outfitting and sustaining such forces
could be nearly unsurmountable.

The Kingdom of Denmark's military security responsibility for Greenland
is directed by the Royal Danish forces. The Self-Government of Greenland
provides Greenland some voice in its governing, but formal
self-governing authorities extended from the Realm of Denmark to the
Inuit people of Greenland are thin at best.\[x\] For defense security,
Greenland relies on Denmark's defense for its security given the high
cost associated with securing its island borders. What is not clear is
what levels of effort exist between Greenlandic Inuit people and Royal
Danish forces to collaborate in the defense of Greenland.

It is anticipated that [the momentum towards increasing the
**legitimacy** of Indigenous people in the Artic region will **continue
to advance**]{.underline}. This advancement necessitates a trust
responsibility that can overshadow the historical (and even current)
oppressive and marginalization behaviors, policies, and laws of central
governments. For American Indians and Alaska Native people, the U. S.
Federal Government has a trust responsibility to the wellbeing of Native
people that has been established by law, executive orders, and
policies.\[xi\] Looking ahead, the political, economic, and climate
implications on these three countries demand a collaborative and
inclusive effort to secure and, if necessary, defend the North American
Arctic.

of voices calling to protect indigenous peoples from degradation,

1511]{.underline}. In that year, a Dominican friar, Antonio de
Montesinos, delivered a sermon in Hispaniola to Christopher Columbus'
men [condemning the scandalous behaviour of the colonizers]{.underline}
in waging 'detestable wars' reducing the natives to 'cruel and horrible
servitude', asking 'Are Not the Indians Men?' On what authority have you
waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and
peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an
infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of
before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving
them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the
excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in
order to extract and acquire gold every day?7 6 Henry Cowles, 'A

Protection', British Journal for the History of Science 46, no. 4 (Dec

de las Casas, ed. and trans. George Sanderlin (Maryknoll: Orbis books,

analogies as well as a critique of this dehumanization are implicit in
the question 'Are Not the Indians Men?' already by 1511. 22 The Nature
of Endangerment in India Not long after, in 1516, Bartolomé de las Casas
would be appointed 'Protector of Indians' ('Protector universal de todos
los indios de las Indias') by Cardinal Cisneros. And by 1552, a
full-fledged critique of the devastation laid on indigenous societies
through the colonial encounter was published by las Casas in his seminal
tract, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies ('Brevísima
relación de la destrucción de las Indias').8 This genealogy begins with
[a distinction between what I call human extinction and human
endangerment discourses]{.underline}. As I use these terms, whereas
[human extinction (or eradication) discourse merely reports or sometimes
even celebrates a population's extermination, endangerment discourse
laments it and usually seeks to stem the tide.]{.underline} As far as
backdating the origins of these phenomena[, there is a long
historiographical tradition of recognizing **that las Casas was fighting
to prevent the extinction of Hispanola's Taino Indian
population**]{.underline}.9 He could therefore be considered a preacher
of what I call tribal endangerment discourse. As ethnohistorian Lynne
Guitar shows, while many Spanish sources declared the Taino people
extinct as early as the mid-1500s, individuals continued to appear in
colonial legal records long after that, and many Taino community members
are still struggling to assert their existence to this day.10 Voltaire
in 1756, reflecting on the work of las Casas, wrote 'On est encore
surpris que cette extinction totale d'une race d'hommes dans Hispaniola'
('We are still surprised by this total extinction of a race of men in
Hispaniola').1 Similarly, in the 1770s, the Scottish historian and
reverend William Robertson reflected back on the Spanish Empire's
efforts in the 1500s to protect its new subjects from 'extinction': The
Emperor and his ministers were so sensible of this \[destruction\], and
so solicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which
threatened to render their acquisitions of no value, that from time to
time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been made for securing to
that unhappy people more gentle and equitable treatment. But the
distance of America from the seat of empire, the feebleness of
government in the new colonies, the avarice and audacity of soldiers
unaccustomed to restraint, prevented these salutary regulations from
operating with any considerable influence. The evil continued to grow .

Sagan himself managed to brief the Soviet Central Committee on the
concept in 1986, reportedly making a lasting impression. Gorbachev
personally told Sagan that he had familiarized himself with the
research, and retrospectively he attributed his willingness to
compromise in superpower negotiations partly to the specter of nuclear
winter.44 As for Ronald Reagan, a streak of nuclear abolitionism seemed
to have always been running through his veins.45 In the fall of 1983, it
was obviously much strengthened. A series of critical events have been
held responsible for this: the downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 by
a Soviet fighter plane in early September; a private prescreening for
the president of the ABC television drama The Day After on October 20;
Reagan's eventual introduction to US nuclear war plans about a week
later; and the apparent misreading in Moscow of NATO's Able Archer
exercise as cover for a nuclear first-strike in early November.46 While
nuclear winter has not been mentioned in this context, Sagan's initial
article, the Washington conference, and the ensuing media blitz all fell
smack dab into this crucial period and should have added to Reagan's
trepidation. In early 1985, at any rate, with Reagan's rapprochement
toward the Soviet Union well under way, the president told two
journalists that "a \[nuclear\] war could just end up in no victory for
anyone, because we would wipe out the Earth as we know it. And if you
think back to a couple of natural calamities, back in the last century,
in the 1800s, just natural phenomena from earthquakes -- or, I mean,
volcanoes, we saw the weather so changed that there was snow in July in
many temperate countries. And they've called it the year in which there
was no summer. Well, if one volcano can do that, what are we talking
about with a whole nuclear exchange: the nuclear winter that scientists
have been talking about? It's possible."47 If we cannot gauge with any
precision the degree to which the nuclear winter scenario influenced
peace activists or policymakers, the concept's larger significance -- it
seems to me -- lies somewhere else. For not only do its dire predictions
enqueue the notion of nuclear winter in a discourse of doom and
desolation that was the hallmark of the era, but also its unique
blending of arms control and ecological concerns establishes it as a
crossover phenomenon that anticipated the post--Cold War concerns of
today's world.

Nuclear Winter and the Narratives of Crisis in the 1970s and 1980s

The 1970s is considered a long "decade of nightmares," spanning a dozen
or more years of "malaise and mayhem," which, as one observer put it,
were "characterized by bad hair, bad clothes, bad music, bad design, bad
books, bad politics, bad economics, bad carpeting, bad fabrics and a lot
of bad ideas."48 "In the life of the mind," wrote Tony Judt, "the
nineteen seventies were the most dispirited decade of the twentieth
century."49 Whoever sought refuge in a movie theater better have gotten
ready for "sinking ships, burning buildings, shark attacks, zombie
invasions, and other disasters and tragedies that reflected the siege
mentality and were staples of Hollywood in the era."50 Columnist Matt
Ridley remembers, "When I was a student, in the 1970s, the world was
coming to an end. The adults told me so. They said the population
explosion was unstoppable, mass famine was imminent, a cancer epidemic
caused by chemicals in the environment was beginning, the Sahara desert
was advancing by a mile a year, the ice age was returning, oil was
running out, air pollution was choking us and nuclear winter would
finish us off \... By the time I was 21 years old I realized that nobody
had ever said anything optimistic to me -- in a lecture, a television
program or even a conversation in a bar -- about the future of the
planet and its people, at least not that I could recall. Doom was
certain."51 And Ridley's list does not even include slumping economic
growth, rising unemployment, turmoil in monetary markets, escalating
inner-city crime rates, political violence in Italy, Spain, West
Germany, and Northern Ireland, Palestinian terrorism (including
recurring skyjackings), and myriad postcolonial and civil wars in Africa
and Asia. No wonder, then, that crisis is a leitmotif of many histories
of the twentieth century's last quarter.52

Yet there are also an increasing number of scholars who see in the 1970s
not just crisis but also the spawning ground for many ideas that shape
today's world.53 The tectonic shift causing the tremors and releasing
the force of creative destruction is generally held to be "the shock of
the global."54 Most authors understand this shock to have been first and
foremost socioeconomic, shattering the foundations of the Fordist model
of industrial society and instigating the transition to a
postterritorial, digital capitalism dominated by flighty financial
markets.55 Yet we may just as well place special emphasis on a different
"global" experience, namely the sudden realization that planet Earth was
an endangered beauty floating in a black and boundless sea of
nothingness -- a realization that unleashed what J. R. McNeill has
called "global-scale environmentalism."56 From this perspective the most
important legacy of the depressing 1970s might well be a new
appreciation of the precariousness of the human habitat and the
limitations of its natural resources. Patrick Kupper has coined the term
"1970s diagnosis" for this profound redefinition of the relationship
between human beings and their natural environment.57 Based on a
full-fledged revolution in scientific thought that spawned new fields of
study like ecology, cybernetics, systems theory, and futurology, the
world was now conceived of as a complicated and interdependent
configuration of systems wherein everything was connected to everything
else. Regulatory regimes that had hitherto been by and large autonomous,
like air monitoring, water pollution control, or noise protection, were
now all assigned to national agencies responsible for the protection of
the environment. Formerly single-issue citizens' groups either followed
this trend or banded together in umbrella organizations. At the same
time, traditional and frequently right-of-center conservationist groups
were either eclipsed by or downright transformed into reform movements
with a leftist, or at least alternative, streak.58

Two scholarly conferences and two iconic images encapsulated,
identified, and energized the breakthrough to environmentalism in the
halfdecade between 1968 and 1972. The Intergovernmental Conference of
Experts on the Scientific Basis for Rational Use and Conservation of the
Resources of the Biosphere (known as the Biosphere Conference) convened
in Paris in September 1968. Sponsored by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), it marked the
culmination of a spate of smaller conferences emphasizing the
interrelatedness of the environment and presenting the biosphere as a
system, the whole of which could be affected by activities in any one
part of it.59 Four years later, in June 1972, the United Nations
Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm. According to
historian John McCormick, it was "the single most influential event in
the evolution of the international environmental movement."60
Representatives from 113 countries and more than 400 nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) discussed the damage that human mismanagement was
doing to the interrelated system sketched out earlier. A statement
prepared by the NGOs and read to the conference by Margaret Mead noted,
"So great has been the technological thrust of our science and energy,
so rapacious our consumption of nonrenewable resources, so rapid our
growth in numbers, so heavy the load we place on our life-supporting
systems that we begin to perceive the finite qualities of the biosphere
of soil, air and water \... This is a revolution in thought fully
comparable to the Copernican revolution."61 The realization that there
were limitations to the exploitation of the planet, that depletion at
one end or in one area would have repercussions elsewhere, and that
humankind therefore had a joint responsibility to safeguard the
resources it depended upon, was articulated most forcefully in an
unofficial report drawn up as a kind of conceptual framework for the
conference and later published as Only One Earth. In it, authors Barbara
Ward and René Dubos appealed for a "sense of planetary community" and
implored the human race to show some "loyalty to the earth."62

This empathy for Planet Earth derived much of its vigor from two
spectacular photographs that mesmerized terrestrials in the late 1960s
and early 1970s. The first had been taken on Christmas Eve 1968 by the
crew of Apollo 8 as the spacecraft was orbiting the moon and, suddenly,
spotted the Earth appearing over the lunar horizon. As the poet
Archibald MacLeish wrote the following day in a much-noticed commentary,
"For the first time in all of time men have seen the earth: seen it not
as continents or oceans from the little distance of a hundred miles or
two or three, but seen it from the depth of space \... To see the earth
as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence
where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together,
brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold."63 More than
thirty years later, Denis Cosgrove has argued with good reason that
Apollo's "most enduring cultural impact has not been knowledge of the
Moon, but an altered image of the earth."64 Joachim Radkau has even
suggested that with this change of perspective the Copernican revolution
has, in a sense, come full circle: Earth is no longer deemed to be just
one planet among many but is once again thought of as one of a kind.65
Today the year 1968 might evoke pictures of riots and assassinations but
as that year drew to a close, American newspaper editors voted Apollo 8
the story of the year and a special issue of Life magazine, looking back
on "The Incredible Year '68," put a picture of Earth on the cover, as
did -- of course -- Ward and Dubos's published report to the Stockholm
conference in 1972.

The second spectacular photograph, taken in 1972, resulted from Apollo's
final mission and went on to assume an even more iconic status.
According to Denis Cosgrove, the famous "Blue Marble" shot of the full
Earth upset conventional Western cartographic conventions, primarily by
stripping away the graticule. "Thus liberated, and with no signs of
naming, boundary marking, or possession, Earth appears to float free as
a sui generis organism."66 The image has become nothing less but
ubiquitous. In the United States it soon turned up as the logo for Earth
Day. Friends of the Earth, an environmental lobby group founded in 1969
in the United States that by 1971 had begun to evolve into an
international network, used the image often and effectively. In 1979,
James Lovelock put it on the cover of his widely discussed first Gaia
book, in which he proposed to see Earth as a single unified and
self-regulating organism; more recently Al Gore has used it as a
backdrop for his slideshow on climate change that served as the basis
for his 2006 book and film An Inconvenient Truth (meanwhile an audiobook
edition of Gore's first environmental bestseller Earth in the Balance
finds itself adorned by the Earthrise photograph from the earlier Apollo
mission). In fact, the "Blue Marble" has been designated "the most
widely reproduced image in human history." It has been used not only for
environmental issues but also for purposes ranging from human and animal
rights to global education, not to mention indiscriminate examples of
commercial advertising.67

Apollo's earlier photographs had shown how small and lonely our planet
appeared set against a vast black infinity and had thus evoked feelings
of humility and human solidarity. Just a few weeks before the Stockholm
conference opened, President Richard Nixon in outlining his
environmental program to the US Congress had noted, "We are now growing
accustomed to the view of our planet as seen from space -- a blue and
brown disk shrouded in white patches of clouds \... No matter what else
divides men and nations, this perspective should unite them."68 The
"Blue Marble" shot, by contrast, picturing Earth alone and filling the
frame, manifested the globe's vitality and organic unity, generating
sentiments of home and parental care. As Robert Poole has observed,
"Suddenly the image of the Earth was everywhere \... Since then, the
phrase 'blue planet' has come to be bound up with the idea of caring for
the Earth."69 A good example for this nexus is provided by biologist
Lewis Thomas. In 1974 he wrote "Viewed from the distance of the Moon,
the astonishing thing about the Earth, catching the breath, is that it
is alive."70 A decade later, he echoed this sensation in his foreword to
the proceedings of the Nuclear Winter conference in Washington.
Confessing that the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in a
photograph in all his life had been "the planet Earth seen from the
distance of the moon, hanging there in space, obviously alive," Thomas
urged his readers to consider that -- if the nuclear winter thesis was
accurate -- the two billion people estimated to die as a result of a
nuclear war were only part of the story. "Something else will have
happened at the same time, in which human beings ought to feel the same
stake as in the loss of their own lives. The elaborate, coherent,
beautifully organized ecosystem of the Earth -- what some people call
the biosphere and others refer to as nature -- will have been dealt a
mortal or near-mortal blow."71 The Apollo images reinforced and
visualized a transformed worldview that simultaneously found expression
in Paris, Stockholm, and elsewhere, and that represented the soundboard
from which the notion of nuclear winter resonated. Knowing this full
well, Carl Sagan had commissioned a film on the climatic consequences of
TTAPS's baseline scenario, which was shown to the press following the
Halloween conference. Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC's Nightline, included
the footage in the late-night news program's coverage of the conference.
Extolled one critic, "Koppel, making use of 'graphics' that had been
created for the conference, displayed a new and arresting image of the
peril that threatens us. First, we saw the now familiar picture of the
earth in space. Then a dark cap materialized on the top half. It moved
down over the bottom half as well, like a shade being pulled down in
front of a lighted window at night, until our bright and fair planet was
totally dark."72 Nuclear winter was part and parcel of a larger and
powerful concern for the well-being of that newly discovered living
organism called Earth.

From the very start this concern was accompanied by a chorus of
whistleblowers and doomsayers.73 After Rachel Carson had launched her
anything but quiescent clarion call against the American pesticide
industry in her 1962 bestseller Silent Spring, subsequent premonitions
grew increasingly alarming. In 1968 Paul Ehrlich, who would later
spearhead the biological side of nuclear winter research, published one
of the bestselling eco-political treatises of all time. In The
Population Bomb he argued that humankind could save itself only if it
got a handle on overpopulation. Barry Commoner, an environmental
activist and professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis,
disagreed. Instead of population growth he identified as the root
problem an economy that was processing and churning out evermore
synthetics, disposable products, pesticides, and detergents. In his 1971
book The Closing Circle, Commoner set down four laws of ecology,
including that there is only one interconnected ecosphere for all living
organisms and, most memorably, that there is no such thing as a free
lunch.74 British science journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor took these and
other concerns and consolidated them in a popular Doomsday Book. 75
These Anglo-American debates were increasingly reflected in the media
and reverberated in Europe as well.

In West Germany, for example, Bernhard Grzimek, the director of the
Frankfurt Zoo and immensely popular host of a television series called
Ein Platz für Tiere (Wildlife Refuge), encouraged the weekly Der Spiegel
to publish a cover story on environmental problems in the fall of 1970.
The issue sold half a million copies in no time.76 Grzimek had recently
been appointed nature conservation commissioner by Chancellor Willy
Brandt, whose center-left coalition had virtually invented environmental
politics in West Germany as part of its larger reform agenda.77 The
government's educational work soon found expression in many ways, as in
children's and youth magazines like Der kleine Tierfreund (Little Animal
Lover), which in September 1970 devoted an entire issue to "The
Endangered Planet." The inside front cover with the table of contents
showed Apollo's Earthrise photograph. Indeed, as Jens Ivo Engels has
demonstrated, Grzimek and other nature filmmakers used their popular
wildlife documentaries to transform the mental image of nature from a
heroic yet distant wilderness into a close and personal but at the same
time endangered habitat.78 To be sure, Grzimek also soon annoyed many of
his political superiors when he chimed in with the prophets of doom.

The voices of gloom and doom reached a crescendo in 1972. In January,
British ecologists published A Blueprint for Survival, concluding that
"if current trends are allowed to persist, the breakdown of society and
the irreversible disruption of life-support systems on this planet,
possibly by the end of the century, certainly within the lifetimes of
our children, are inevitable."79 Two months later the Club of Rome
published its report on the Limits to Growth, arguing that pollution,
population growth, and the exhaustion of resources attendant to
exponential growth, if unchecked, would bring on certain catastrophe by
the end of the century. The report attracted an unprecedented amount of
public attention, perhaps because this time the apocalyptic message
emanated from one of those modern, cybernetic computer models that had
up to now embodied the fantasies of feasibility associated with public
management ideas of the 1960s.80 In this regard, that is, in its
application of complex computer models, the nuclear winter concept was a
worthy successor to the Club of Rome report. If the latter, however, had
focused on socioeconomic trends, TTAPS tapped into the work of
astronomers, climatologists, and geologists and the contingency of
sudden climate change that some of their models suggested.81

By the early 1980s, of course, delusions of planning and control had
long fallen out of favor. Rather, the things that were out of control
dominated public discourse throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in particular
when it came to the human habitat. Acid rain, toxic wastes, filthy seas,
contaminated landscapes, dying forests, suffocating cities, nuclear
nightmares, endangered species, ozone depletion, global warming, and
other alarming news commanded the headlines. With reference to a spate
of Hollywood disaster movies, Der Spiegel observed that real-life angst
was also reflected on the screen. In 1981, with Cold War tensions rising
and a progeny of Hollywood in the White House, impending nuclear
apocalypse achieved pride of place: "The US president's 'doomsday'
machine, his airborne command post for ending the world in an atomic
blaze, is ready for takeoff," readers were advised in a slightly crooked
account. "Today, the touch of a button is all it takes for the salto
mortale into the void."82 If this widely read weekly is any indicator,
angst must have reigned supreme in West Germany. Hardly a month had
passed from the 1981 year-end cover story on apocalyptic scenarios when
the magazine upped the ante with a six-part series on "German Angst,"
quickly followed by a four-part series about 'Unprotected Nature.'"83
This array of topics marks a striking shift in the source of anxiety.
For a generation or two, the Russians had dominated German -- or, for
that matter, Western -- angst; now it was rockets and reactors. Ideology
took a backseat to ecology. If the world was no longer divisible into
protected nature reserves and a vastly greater portion of the planet to
be exploited and contaminated at will, then a similar division into East
and West was also meaningless and obsolete.84 This new type of anxiety
gripped not just Germans, and the prophets of doom freely admitted that
they wanted people worldwide to be afraid. In his introduction to a
collection of essays concerned with psychological and moral aspects of
nuclear winter, psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon, a close associate of Carl
Sagan, adjured his readers, "[[We **need**]{.mark} the courage [to **be
afraid** and]{.mark} to [make our]{.mark} friends, neighbors, and
**[colleagues afraid]{.mark}** -- with a fear \... [not]{.mark} so much
[for **ourselves** as for]{.mark} our children, for **civilization**,
and for [this]{.mark} precious **[world]{.mark}**."]{.underline}85

The [[fear]{.mark} for "this precious **world**" is what [**makes**
the]{.mark} nuclear winter [episode **unique**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the annals of opposition to the nuclear threat. In fact, [with the
**introduction** of nuclear winter [the **protest** against]{.mark} the
**[arms race]{.mark}** squarely [**arrived** in]{.mark} the field of
**[environmentalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Contemporaries made that
connection quite casually. In 1984 the Natural Resources Defense Council
(NRDC), one of the most powerful environmental groups in the United
States, put out a booklet titled "Nuclear Winter, Silent Spring" warning
that "biologists predict that a nuclear winter would be followed by a
spring more silent than Rachel Carson ever imagined."86 The following
year the SCOPE report foregrounded the close conjunction between nuclear
winter and environmental concerns even more forcefully. SCOPE, the
Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, was founded in 1969
as a branch of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
Its purpose was to study the effects of humanity on the environment.
After the problem of nuclear winter came into the open, SCOPE organized
a series of conferences on the subject leading to the publication of a
nine-hundred-page, two-volume report in September 1985. 87 The upshot of
the report was that people had to bid adieu to traditional views of
nuclear war. As Mark Harwell, one of the report's authors put it,
"Hiroshima is a dangerously misleading example of what the next nuclear
war would be like."88 Forget about blast, heat, and radiation, the
report in effect said; stop thinking of billions of casualties and the
destruction of cultural assets; instead, start worrying about Earth as
the enduring home of the human species and innumerable other species as
well. To drive this message home, SCOPE not only hired a public
relations agency to tout the launch of the report, but also commissioned
a writer to create an abridged paperback version entitled Planet Earth
in Jeopardy. 89 Nuclear war, said Harwell, constituted "war waged on the
global environment itself."90

To be sure, many effects of nuclear explosions on the environment were
there to see from the very start. One of the iconic pictures of the
still young nuclear age was the slow motion footage of some neatly
arranged rows of trees being blown back like hassock from a nuclear
blast. The sequence has been called "a moment of pure ecological
devastation," and deservedly so.91 Moreover, the first truly global
environmental issue had indeed been the danger of fallout from nuclear
testing. This is what turned Rachel Carson and Barry Commoner into
activists long before they took on pesticides and synthetics. As early
as 1963, Commoner described nuclear weapons tests as "a gigantic
experiment in ecology."92 Yet when the testing went underground, so did
the campaigns for nuclear disarmament.93 It took the collapse of SALT II
and the Reagan administration's loose rhetoric about the viability of
nuclear war along with its intentions to deploy new weapons systems in
the United States and Europe to resuscitate a massive antinuclear
movement. By then, however, the unmitigatedly anthropocentric worldview
of the 1950s had been effectively challenged by biocentric philosophies
put forward by the emerging environmental movement, inscribed in the
public mind by the dystopian discourse of the 1970s, and visualized for
everyone to see by a pair of spectacular photographs from the Apollo
space missions. Consequently, as one contemporary observer has noted,
"Nationalism and other 'ethnolocalisms' are now replaced, for many, with
a new identity as planetary citizens, as members of an interdependent
species living in fragile grace."94

Ironically, the Cold War nuclear project itself contributed mightily to
this new identity that was grounded in a new vision of the planet as an
integrated biosphere. For one, in order to enable the military to gauge
the full effects of nuclear explosions, it fostered an extraordinary
state commitment to atmospheric and earth sciences.95 As Jon Agar has
put it, "It took a global conflict to create the particular conditions
to identify global warming as a global phenomenon."96 On top of that, it
also fueled the rise of computer technology to help appraise all the new
data and manage command, control, and communications needs.97 And the
Cold War, of course, also begot the space race that gave us Apollo's
iconic images.98 At any rate, antinuclear protesters of the early 1980s
operated against the background of a radically altered worldview. It
encompassed both an attitudinal reversal of the Copernican revolution
and what Matthias Dörries has called an "epistemological double
transformation": the environmental side-effects of nuclear weapons were
no longer thought of as merely short term, nor as geographically
limited.99 [[Nuclear winter is the **site** where these]{.mark} profound

[The **prescription** for decolonization]{.underline} -- that is, a
normative project committed to the liberation of the colonized and the
overturning of colonial relationships of power (Kohn and McBride, 2011:
3) -- [is indeed one of the most **counter-hegemonic implications** of
the settler colonial paradigm]{.underline} as applied to
Israel-Palestine, [**potentially shifting** it from a **diagnostic**
frame to a **prognostic** one which offers a 'proposed solution to the
problem, or at least a plan of attack']{.underline} (Benford and Snow,
2000: 616). [What, however, **does** the settler colonial paradigm offer
by way of envisioning decolonization?]{.underline} As Veracini (2007)
notes, while settler colonial studies scholars have sought to address
the lack of attention paid to the experiences of indigenous peoples in
conventional historiographical accounts of decolonization (which have
mostly focused on settler independence and the loosening of ties to the
'motherland'), [[there is]{.mark} nevertheless [a **'narrative
deficit'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [when it comes to **imagining settler
[decolonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Veracini (2007) relates
this deficit to a matter of conceptualization, [it is apparent that the
[**structural perspective** of the **paradigm**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in
many ways [**closes down** possibilities of imagining]{.mark} the type
of **social** and **political [transformation]{.mark}** [to
which]{.mark} the notion of **[decolonization
aspires]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In this regard, [there is a **worrying
tendency**]{.mark} (if not tautological discrepancy) in settler colonial
studies, [where]{.mark} **the [only solution]{.mark}** to settler
colonialism [is **decolonization**]{.mark} -- [which]{.mark} a
**faithful adherence** to the paradigm [**renders largely
unachievable**, if not **impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to return to Wolfe's
(2013a: 257) account of settler colonialism as guided by a 'zero-sum
logic whereby settler societies, for all their internal complexities,
uniformly require the elimination of Native alternatives'. The
structuralism of this account has immense power as a means of mapping
forms of injustice and indignity as well as strategies of resistance and
refusal, and Wolfe is careful to show how transmutations of the logic of
elimination are complex, variable, discontinuous and uneven. Yet, in
seeking to elucidate the logic of elimination as the overarching
historical force guiding settlernative relations there is an operational
weakness in the theory, whereby such a logic is simply there,
omnipresent and manifest even when (and perhaps especially when) it
appears not to be; the settler colonial studies scholar need only read
it into a situation or context. It thus hurtles from the past to the
present into the future, never to be fully extinguished until the native
is, or until history itself ends. There is thus a powerful ontological
(if not metaphysical) dimension to Wolfe's account, where there is such
thing as a 'settler will' that inherently desires the elimination of the
native and the distinction between the settler and the native can only
ever be categorical, founded as it is on the 'primal binarism of the
frontier' (2013a: 258). It is here that the differences between earlier
settler colonial scholarship on Israel-Palestine and the recent settler
colonial turn come into clearest view. While Jamal Hilal's (1976)
Marxist account of the conflict, for instance, engaged Palestinians and
Jewish Israelis in terms of their relations to the means of production,
Wolfe's account brings its own ontology: the bourgeoisie/proletariat
distinction becomes that of settler/native, and the class struggle the
struggle between settler, who seeks to destroy and replace the native,
and native, who can only ever push back. Indeed, if the settler colonial
paradigm views history in similar teleological terms to the Marxist
framework, it does not offer the same hopeful vision of a liberated
future. After all, settler colonialism has only one story to tell --
'either total victory or total failure' (Veracini, 2007).

Veracini's attempt to disaggregate different forms of settler
decolonization is revealing of the difficulties that come along with
this zero-sum perspective. It is significant to note that beyond settler
evacuation (which may decolonize territory, he cautions, but not
necessarily relationships) the picture he paints is a relatively bleak
one. For Veracini (2011: 5), claims for decolonization from indigenous
peoples in settler societies can take two broad forms: an 'anti-colonial
rhetoric expressing a demand for indigenous sovereign independence and
self-determination \... and an ''ultra''-colonial one that seeks a
reconstituted partnership with the \[settler state\] and advocates a
return to a relatively more respectful middle ground and ''treaty''
conditions'. While both, he suggests, are tempting strategies in the
struggle for change, though 'ultimately ineffective against settler
colonial structures of domination' (2011: 5), it is the latter strategy
that invites Veracini's most scathing assessment. As he writes,

under settler colonial conditions the independent polity is the settler
polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples has
historically been used as a powerful weapon in the denial of indigenous
entitlement and in the enactment of various forms of coercive
assimilation. This decolonisation actually enhances the subjection of
indigenous peoples\... it is at best irrelevant and at worst detrimental
to indigenous peoples in settler societies. (2011: 6--7)

The 'primal binarism of the frontier' plays a particularly ambivalent
role in Veracini's (2011: 6) formulation, where the categorical
distinction between settler and native obstructs the 'possibility of a
genuinely decolonized relationship' (by virtue of its lopsidedness) yet
is a necessary political strategy to guard against the absorption of
indigenous people into the settler fold, which would represent settler
colonialism's final victory. The battle here is between a 'settler
colonialism \[that\] is designed to produce a fundamental discontinuity
as its ''logic of elimination'' runs its course until it actually
extinguishes the settler colonial relation' and an anti-colonial
struggle that 'must aim to keep the settler-indigenous relationship
going' (2011: 7). In other words, the categorical distinction produced
by the frontier must be maintained in order to struggle against its
effects. Given the lack of options presented to indigenous peoples by
Veracini (2014: 315), his conclusion that settler decolonization demands
a 'radical, post-settler colonial passage' is perhaps not surprising --
although he has 'no suggestion as to how this may be achieved and \[is\]
pessimistic about its feasibility'.

Scholars have long reckoned with the ambivalence of the settler colonial
situation, which is simultaneously colonial and postcolonial, colonizing
and decolonizing (Curthoys, 1999: 288). Given the generally dreadful
Fourth World circumstances facing many indigenous peoples in settler
societies, it could be argued that there is good reason for such
pessimism. The settler colonial paradigm, in this sense, offers an
important caution against celebratory narratives of progress. Wolfe
(1994), it must be recalled, wrote the original articulation of his
thesis precisely against the idea of 'historical rupture' that dominated
in Australia postMabo, and was thus as much a scholarly intervention as
it was a political challenge to the idea of Australia having broken with
its colonial past. [**Nonetheless**, the **[fatalism]{.mark}** of the
settler colonial paradigm -- whereby decolonization is by and large put
beyond the realms of possibility -- [has]{.mark} seen it [come
under]{.mark} **considerable [critique]{.mark}** [for **reifying
set**]{.mark}tler **[col]{.mark}**onialism [as]{.mark} a
**transhistorical [meta-structure]{.mark}** [where **colonial
relations**]{.mark} of domination [are
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Macoun and Strakosch, 2013: 435 ;
Snelgrove et al., 2014: 9). [[Not only does]{.mark}]{.underline} Wolfe's
[[ontology]{.underline} **[erase contingency]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[heterogeneity [and]{.mark} (crucially) **[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Merlan, 1997; Rowse, 2014), [[but its]{.mark} **polarized
[framework]{.mark}** effectively **['puts politics to
death']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Svirsky, 2014: 327). In response to such
critiques, Wolfe (2013a: 213) suggests that 'the repudiation of
binarism' may just represent a 'settler perspective'. However, as
Elizabeth Povinelli (1997: 22) has astutely shown, it is in this regard
that the totalizing logic of Wolfe's structure of invasion rests on a
disciplinary gesture where 'any discussion which does not insist on the
polarity of the \[settler\] colonial project' is assimilationist, worse
still, genocidal in effect if not intent. Any attempt to 'explore the
dialogical or hybrid nature of colonial subjectivity' -- which would
entail working beyond the bounds of absolute polarity -- is disciplined
as complicit in the settler colonial project itself, leaving 'the only
nonassimilationist position one that adheres strictly and solely to a
critique of \[settler\] state discourse'. [[This]{.mark} gesture not
only **[disallows]{.mark}** the [**possibility** of **counter-publics**
and **strategic alliances**]{.mark}]{.underline} (even limited ones),
[[but]{.mark} also [comes]{.mark} **dangerously [close]{.mark}** [to

Historicizing North American Colonialism

In his 2019 biography of Walter Ralegh (also spelled Raleigh), historian
Alan Gallay reminds us of the historical and theoretical complexity of
colonialism in North America. Writing about 16thand 17th-century English
colonialism, Gallay observes the distinction that the English did not
talk about settler societies but instead made a distinction between a
"plantation" and a "colony." While both "involved moving groups of
people to new lands," Ralegh and his contemporaries used "plantation"
when referring to a settlement that the English Monarch "had a secure
claim" to. In contrast, "colonies" existed in places "where sovereignty
had yet to be ensured."18

Gallay's [historical [**specificity** is important]{.mark}]{.underline}.
He reminds us of the [uncertainties, **[dynamism]{.mark}**, and
fluidity]{.underline} that [[characterized early]{.mark}
modern]{.underline} "plantations" and [["**colonies**" in]{.mark} North
**[America]{.mark}**]{.underline}--- something that distinguishes them
from 19th- and 20th-century Anglophone settler colonies. [In the
**16th** and **17th** centuries, [settlers]{.mark} (a **diverse group**,
often with **competing interests**) **[did not]{.mark} automatically
[look at Indigenous]{.mark}** people [and think about
**"eliminating"**]{.mark} **them**]{.underline}. Building on a rich body
of thought that went back to the Norman conquest of England, [the
English in North America]{.underline} might have [framed
**colonization** as an opportunity to **engage** Indigenous
**communities**]{.underline} in a benevolent enterprise, [or speak about
it as an act of "**co-creation**"]{.underline} designed to benefit both
colonizer and colonized. The English articulated both of these
perspectives. The job of the historian is to evaluate the degree to
which such rhetoric was genuinely felt or whether it was simply
justification for darker motives.19

[Positing [the need for]{.mark} this type of [careful]{.mark}
**historical [analysis]{.mark}** [is not to say]{.mark} that
["**eliminationist**"]{.mark} forms of physical **violence**, including
[**genocidal violence**, did not occur]{.mark}]{.underline} in early
colonial North America.20 [It is **[instead]{.mark}** a reminder that
[the **present**]{.mark}]{.underline}, much less the future, [[was
**anything but certain** for]{.mark} English
[settlers]{.mark}]{.underline} during the 17th century. [This is why the
written [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} from this formative century in
Anglo colonialism [[includes a]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly
[contradictory [**mix** of]{.mark} settler calls for
["**extermination**" and "**extirpation**"]{.mark} of Indigenous people,
**missionary** efforts]{.underline} to convert Indians to Christianity,
[intermarriages between English]{.underline} (and after the Act of Union
in 1707, British) traders and Indigenous women, [and colonial efforts
[to forge **trade** and **diplomatic** alliances]{.mark} with Native
polities]{.underline}.21 [**[Violence]{.mark}**, **disease**,
[**diplomacy**, and **trade**]{.mark} could, and [did,
**coexist**]{.mark}. The **shear diversity** of human relations makes
the application of a **single** interpretative **framework** in early
colonial America **difficult** to sustain.]{.underline}

For instance, consider the complex ways that disease impacted Indigenous
people and Anglo-Indian relations. Narratives about "smallpox vials" and
disease-infected blankets have punctuated both scholarly and vernacular
accounts of settler colonialism from Australia to the United States.22
The historical reality is more nuanced. Historians Alfred Crosby, David
Jones, and Paul Kelton, to name just three, have spent decades analyzing
disease transfer in early colonial America. A variety of diseases struck
down an estimated 70 to 90 percent of the Native North American
population---seemingly genocidal levels of death that resulted in
cultural and linguistic loss, and in some cases, societal collapse.23
But in assessing such catastrophic figures, historians have reminded us
that while colonizers sometimes cheered the loss of Indigenous
life---seeing disease-induced mortality as God's punishment of "savage"
people---early modern Europeans did not possess the epidemiological
knowledge to engage in germ warfare. In fact, settlers born in the North
American colonies were just as likely as Native Americans to sicken and
die from European diseases.24 The history of disease in early colonial
America is therefore as complex as histories of violence.

Given the variety of competing Indigenous and European interests across
North America prior to the American Revolution, historians returning to
the subject of violence are advised to do so with care and attention to
historical specificity. [It's important to remember]{.underline} that
[**[British]{.mark}** people [came to]{.mark} North [**America** under
different]{.mark}]{.underline} circumstances and with an [assortment of
[**goals**. Some]{.mark} arrived [with]{.mark} the [**Crown's
patronage**, others]{.mark} were **convicts** or indentured
**servants**. Still others [sought **trading**]{.mark} **partners**
[and]{.mark} new **[markets]{.mark}**, and growing **populations**
imagined a future in which they **stayed**. The crosscurrent of colonial
origin stories, **motivations**, and ambitions reveals how the
**[settler societies]{.mark}** that emerged during the late **18th** and
early **19th** centuries [were **not guaranteed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We should therefore avoid the teleology of a previous generation of
historians who became trapped in a framework that viewed early colonial
America as a means of explaining the emergence of the American
Republic.25 There were simply no certainties in early colonial America.

But it is true that prerevolutionary North America was punctuated with
intense bursts of prejudice---"savages," "vermine," "errors of
nature"---and violence that ranged from local skirmishes to genocide.26
The examples are strewn across the historical landscape: the
Anglo-Powhatan Wars in Virginia and the massacre of Native men, women,
and children between the 1620s and 1640s; the Mystic Massacre of six
hundred to seven hundred Pequot Indians in 1637; the Dutch-inspired
attack against Tankitekes (or Siwanoy) and Wappinger people at Pound
Ridge in New York in 1644 that saw between to five hundred and seven
hundred Indians killed; the massacres of Indigenous people that occurred
during Metacom's War of 1675--1676, also known as King Philip's War.27
[The list of [**genocidal** outbursts]{.mark} goes on and on; they
[**appear** to fit]{.mark} the **narrative** of **[elimination]{.mark}**
outlined [by **s**]{.mark}ettler **[c]{.mark}**olonial
**[t]{.mark}**heorists. [However]{.mark}, in the **context** of early
colonial **America**, we also need to **keep in mind** that intense
[violence could **coexist** with]{.mark} robust [**treaty**
negotiations]{.mark} between **English** colonial officials and
**Indigenous** leaders]{.underline}. In such contexts, historical
analysis can reveal the strength of Native diplomats and the strategic
weakness of colonial officials as they struggled to cobble together
effective governing structures for their respective colonies.28 In such
instances, should we interpret settler violence as evidence of anxiety
and weakness, not strength? Can we call Anglo-Indian diplomacy an
example of settler colonialism? Should we assume that treaty making
aimed simply to dispossess and "eliminate" Native Americans? And [where
does Indigenous **agency** fit into this **history?**]{.underline}29

This latter question is one that historians should not lose sight of.
Historian Charles Prior has addressed questions of Indigenous agency in
the diplomatic history of early colonial North America. Focusing on the
Iroquois, [Prior identifies "**overlapping** and contested **'zones'**
of **sovereignty**" in which **no form** of colonialism exercised
**hegemony** in North America. Indeed, "**Indigenous power**" meant that
**colonizers** found themselves **bending** to the **demands** of Native
**kinship** structures and **economic** objectives]{.underline}. This
proved true across North America, with frontiers and borderlands,
contested zones, "Native grounds," and "middle grounds," punctuating the
Anglo-Indian political landscape alongside preexisting rivalries among
Native polities.30

The diverse geohistorical experiences of Indigenous people and
colonizers make the application of a single interpretive model fraught
with potential inadequacies. For example, one of the central arguments
in Wolfe's "eliminationist" theory of settler colonialism is the
contention that Indigenous labor was superfluous to settlers. This
argument almost universally ignores Native American traditions of
captivity and kinship and underestimates the entanglements of Indigenous
people with enslavement during the 18th and 19th centuries. Indigenous
labor, both enslaved and non-enslaved, is a complex part of North
America's colonial history.31 Studies by historians such as James Brooks
and Paul Conrad reveal the changing significance of Indigenous captivity
and slavery to both Native and colonizer populations throughout the
American West between the 17th and 19th centuries. This work sheds light
on how enslavement and the coerced transportation of Indian captives
caused social dislocation and fractured kinship networks among the
Apaches and other Indigenous communities.32 Alternatively, historians
Fay Yarbrough and Barbara Krauthamer have taken the lead in studying the
racialization of Native slavery in the Southeast and its entanglements
with colonial economies.33 Collectively, scholarship that illuminates
the intersecting histories of Indigenous-African American people
contextualizes the legacies of these fraught histories and their
connections to Indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and citizenship in
the 21st century. 34

While Veracini builds on Marx and Engels to point to the voracious
appetite of settler societies for expanding markets during the 19th
century, more work is needed to better understand the relationship
between racial slavery and settler colonialism.35 In recognizing changes
in global trade during the 19th and 20th centuries, it is also important
not to lose sight of how Indigenous people adapted to these changing
markets. Indeed, economic histories of settler societies during these
latter centuries brings us back to questions of labor and the
wide-ranging attitudes that Native Americans displayed toward wage and
contract labor, and wealth generation in the centuries after the
American Revolution.36

The US Republic and Settler Colonialism

What of the impact of the American Revolution on settler colonialism in
North America? In the decades after the American Revolution, the United
States exhibited many of the features that theorists associate with
settler societies. [[The]{.mark} unrelenting [**drive** for
**land**]{.mark}, the forced **removal** of Indigenous polities, and the
**elimination** through warfare and **violence** of Indigenous
communities]{.underline} across the American West during the latter half
of the 19th century. 37 These features of United States history [[seem
to **conform**]{.mark} to]{.underline} what historian Edward Cavanagh
describes as [[set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism['s **tendency** to
remain]{.mark} "relentlessly **[active in the
present]{.mark}**."]{.underline}38 In the context of an expanding United
States since the late 18th century, we have to remain open to the
possibility that relentlessness may well have been a product of
weakness, not power. [[It is **important** to remind]{.mark} our
students and readers of our work of the **persistence** [of Indigenous
**political**]{.mark} and military **[power]{.mark}**, the strength of
Native **connections** to place, and the innovative **traditions** of
communities throughout Indian Country [meant]{.mark} that **[US]{.mark}
common [law]{.mark}** traditions, political and economic structures, and
cultural beliefs [continued **bending** to the **arc** of
Indigenous]{.mark} diplomatic skill and **[influence]{.mark}** well into
the **19th century**]{.underline}. 39

The risk here is that historians uncritically apply an inverted
Turnerarian model of frontier history to their teaching and research. In
1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner lamented the closing of the
frontier in American history. Turner's "frontier thesis" celebrated the
character of American settlers in the context of territorial expansion
and conquest.40 [Settler colonial studies **flips** the "**frontier
thesis**" on its head, seeing]{.underline} the qualities that Turner
celebrated as [evidence of [the "**eliminationist logic**"]{.mark}
driving **settlers** and the **societies** they built]{.underline}. Used
uncritically, [both **models** have the potential to **[silence
Indigenous]{.mark} people**---[positing them as]{.mark} **members** of
[communities who **do not make history** but are people]{.mark} for
[whom **history acts on**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That said, there is room
for the judicious application of theory in historical analysis. This can
involve the decolonization of settler colonial theory to more clearly
hear Native voices, understand Indigenous survivance and sovereignty, or
reconsider the limits of liberal and neoliberal forms of settler
colonialism.41

Historians can avoid the inverted Turnerarian trap by recognizing
adaptive forms of Indigenous kinship and changes in Native political
structures. This work will also expose the fits of willed ignorance,
historical amnesia, and political imaginings that settler Americans
engaged in (and continue engaging in) to justify the sovereignty of the
republic and rationalize its expansion. Enlightenment ideas might have
convinced the educated few that schemes in "human management" could
"assimilate" Native people to the American economy and body politic or
persuade the political classes of the humanity of relocating Indians to
distant reservations, but the reality was more complex.42 The
sovereignty of the United States was far from complete, and by no means
"perfect," in the century after the Revolution. The persistence of
Native forms of land ownership and renewed articulations of tribal
sovereignty challenged both the violence and the legal foundation for
the republic's existence, in addition to its expansion.43 To quote
Prior, "the reality of Indian power should lead us to rethink the ways
in which Indigenous polities confronted colonialism."44

Recognizing the panoply of Indigenous experiences with, and responses
to, different forms of colonialism, does not mean that historians should
ignore what colonizers thought and did. Nor does it mean that historians
should discard settler colonial theory. Jeffrey Ostler makes this point
when he observes that the best evidence for understanding the United
States as a settler state exists in the centuries after the American
Revolution.45

Another area of study that has attracted considerable historical
attention is the question of whether the United States became a settler
empire during the 19th and 20th centuries. Historians have examined
American imperialism and empire building across the Americas from the
Monroe Doctrine, in 1823, to the 21st century, producing a rich
historiography that is well-suited to college classrooms.46 Historian
Norbert Finzsch sets out a framework for understanding the United States
in terms of "settler imperialism." Finzsch defines settler imperialism
as the "expansion of settler colonies and settler states, directed
against 'exterior' indigenous populations, achieved in the context of a
democratic and egalitarian society of white, predominantly Protestant
Anglo-Saxon settlers organized in farms and family households."47

Finzsch reapplies the old theory of herrenvolk democracy, a concept
popularized in American history by George Fredrickson.48 Like
Fredrickson, Finzsch is looking for a historical model that helps
explain the development of white supremacy in the United States during
the 19th century and beyond. Unlike Fredrickson, Finzsch is specifically
interested in exposing the tools of Indigenous "elimination," be they
the erection of fences and Anglo systems of agriculture, or genocidal
violence. According to Finzsch, "the long-lasting processes" of settler
imperialism may include practices and structures that become less
visible (or naturalized) but are "just as deadly as large-scale
massacres and genocides."49 These practices, detailed by historians such
as Anne Hyde, were multifaceted and ranged from squatting on Indian
lands to using settler laws and economic practices to push Native
communities from lands and waterways that formed the basis of their
kinship networks.50

The settler imperialism model has interpretive merits in helping
historians understand different phases of empire building in American
history. However, like settler colonial theory, settler imperialism runs
the risk of being applied as a blunt instrument in understanding the
complexities of US history. Consider, for example, this line from
Chickasaw scholar Jodi [Byrd]{.underline}, who [argues]{.underline} that
[Indigenous peoples "serve primarily as **signposts** and **grave
markers** along the roads of **empire**]{.underline}."51 This [is a
**powerful** theoretical and political **statement**, but **it is not
history**]{.underline}. As historical analysis, [[arguments]{.mark} like
this [ignore **contingency**]{.mark} and **change** over time,
[and]{.mark} they [do]{.mark} a [**disservice** to]{.mark} the diversity
of [**Indigenous** experiences]{.mark} in both the past and present. It
is also a **macabre** [reapplication of the]{.mark} "**dying Indian**"
and ["**doomed race thesis**"]{.mark} of previous
centuries.]{.underline}

Historians J. M. Bacon and Matthew Norton offer a solution to the
ahistoricism that is now popular in literary theory and critical
studies.52 Their 2019 analysis of US policy takes issue with the absence
of Native people in studies of American empire. Bacon and Norton offer a
careful critique of US legal and political maneuvers to render
Indigenous sovereigns "impaired" and "subordinate." The United States
routinely tries to exert its legal power by setting limits to the
sovereign powers of Indigenous nations. The Supreme Court established
the precedents for this legal dynamic in the early 19th century, making
Native sovereignty a question of federal law. Over time, federal courts
divested Indigenous nations of their inherent rights, and in 1903 the US
Congress assumed plenary power over Native communities. Indigenous
leaders did not let these legal and political developments go
unchallenged, any more than they ignore threats to tribal sovereignty in
the 21st century. Increasingly, 20th-century [Native [leaders redeployed
**treaties**]{.mark}--- [often seen]{.mark} in both popular and
professional historical narratives [as]{.mark} **colonial
[tools]{.mark}** [of dispossession---to reassert]{.mark} their
[**sovereignty** and pressure the fed]{.mark}eral **government** [to
live up to its]{.mark} **trust [obligations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
Bacon and Norton make clear, [the **U**nited **S**tates may rely on a
**number** of dubious **legal doctrines**]{.underline} (such as the
Doctrine of Discovery), [but [the]{.mark} **legal [skills]{.mark}** [of
Indigenous **lawyers**]{.mark} and the **savvy** of their political

#### State representation results in selective action due to institutions being self serving and ignoring issues when they're most needed -- perpetuates harm and turns their impacts

*Procedural justice* concerns the extent to which individuals have
influence over the decisions that affect them in accordance with their
rights to participate completely and effectively in equitable
decision-making processes as well as implement their own strategies and
priorities3,12. Fair consultation for activities that will affect---or
have the potential to affect---Arctic Indigenous Peoples requires not
only their participation in decision-making processes but also underpins
the need to reach consensus on issues that have competing interests and
give "free, prior and informed consent" 3,39[. It is common practice for
governments across the Arctic to consult with, and provide information
to, Indigenous Peoples before undertaking developments or initiatives.
However, these practices are insufficient as socio-political
institutions and decisions relating to land and resource management
often oppose and undermine the agency and self-determination of
Indigenous Peoples by failing to include them as partners, acknowledge
them as holding positions of leadership, or recognize Indigenous
worldviews in decision-making processes36,39.]{.underline} Further
complexity can arise from the disadvantageous power dynamics they often
face36,39. For example, Inuit in Nunatsiavut, Canada, have expressed the
devastating impacts of being excluded from wildlife management decisions
surrounding the woodland caribou, which is a culturally significant
species that is at **risk** due to climatic changes and human
activities.

#### Indigenous representation becomes a token for the state -- doesn't resolve genuine issues but instead serves as a tool of silencing and control

Relatedly, Rivera Cusicanqui is quite critical of the concept of
multi-culturalism, especially as it relates to Indigenous peoples. She
insists that the current constructions of multi-culturalism and
multi-raciality-without-Ch\'ixi are (2020:56--57): ...Essentialist and
historicist interpretations of the indigenous question. **[They do not
address the fundamental issues of decolonization but instead obscure and
renew the effective practices of colonization. Their function is to
supplant the indigenous populations as historical subjects and to turn
their struggles and demands into elements of a cultural reengineering
and a state apparatus in order to subjugate them and neutralize their
will.]{.underline}** Rivera Cusicanqui\'s firm critique of
multi-culturalism and multi-raciality-without-Ch\'ixi recognizes that
Indigenous peoples and identities are still actively racialized,
ignored, and removed from these conversations---something that other
Indigenous scholars have recognized as well (Oviedo-Freire, 2021;
Sánchez-Antonio, 2022). Rivera Cusicanqui recognizes [that any
conversation or framework---even well intentioned multicultural
ones---that includes Indigenous peoples does so through a colonial lens
and does so in order to continually subjugate Indigenous people, their
identities, and to hold them to a universal colonial standard, a
violation of the Indigenous pragmatic]{.underline} (Pratt, 2002) and a
viewpoint that can likely court passionate discussion among scholars in
future research.

In recent years, [[it has become]{.mark} increasingly [common to
hear]{.mark} the argument [that]{.mark} race and [**racism**
are]{.mark}---and have long been---[**central** to world **politics**,
yet]{.mark} are too **often [ignored]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline}
the academic [fields of **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} and international security studies.1
Amitav Acharya, a former president of the International Studies
Association, describes "[the emergence of **racism** [as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} scientific, profitable, offensive, geopolitical
[and]{.underline} normative [[basis for]{.mark} **organizing** world
**order**]{.underline}," a "keystone and a shared foundation" [providing
a "mutually-**reinforcing** link between racism, [**slavery** and
**empire**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[which\] is [[a]{.mark} distinct
[**product** of]{.mark}]{.underline} western Europe and [[the
US]{.mark}-led **world [order]{.mark}**]{.underline}." "Despite creating
a set of multilateral institutions, America shunned neither imperialism,
especially in its early stages, nor the balance of power approach" of
the "Westphalian sovereignty and the nation-state" system, Acharya
says.2 Like a number of prominent scholars of race in international
relations (IR), he believes that race and racism have been central to
international politics and that some of the most central concepts of
realist and liberal international relations theory are key components of
that racist system.3

Robert Vitalis, an early pathbreaker in studies of race and global
politics, says that mainstream IR plays down those racial taproots in
part because realists, liberals, and other mainstream scholars feel
satisfied that their own theories based on anarchy, domestic regime
type, or resource rivalry already account for much of this.4 Some
scholars of race realize that their critique of mainstream IR theories
needs to address the great power rivalries that are traditionally
conceived as the international system's core, not only the oppression
and exploitation of \[nonwhite people\] ~~nonwhites~~ in its periphery.
They claim that World War II, for example, was impelled by Hitler's
racism toward Slavs and Jews, Woodrow Wilson's refusal to include racial
equality as a principle in the Versailles Treaty, Japanese resentment of
the 1924US immigration act excluding Asians, and Japan's assumption that
the racially disunified American people would lack the cohesion to
bounce back from Pearl Harbor.5

[While **I agree** that it is high **time** for more **research** on the
conceptual and empirical questions of **race**]{.underline} raised in
this special issue, [[I argue]{.mark} that mainstream approaches
including [**realism** and **liberalism** shed **more light** on]{.mark}
the central **mechanisms** that drive [international
**politics**]{.mark}]{.underline} than do theories that put race in the
central position. This is not because mainstream theories ignore
identity politics, but because their theories of political identity are
more closely tied to the powerful driving mechanisms of the nation-state
and social modernization. [Mainstream **IR** has]{.underline}, in recent
decades, [**worked** hard to understand the continuing **power** of
nationalism and ethnicity using **concepts** that can also
**illuminate** the category of **race**.]{.underline}

[Race and **racism** are still very much **with us** in the era of white
**populist backlash**. Nonetheless]{.underline} it is ironic that many
exponents of racially focused approaches to IR admit that authoritative
[scientific and cultural commentators in powerful **[liberal
societies]{.mark}** have **[changed]{.mark}** their **[views on
race]{.mark}**. They]{.underline} are alleged to have [[**abandoned**
the]{.mark}ir earlier [view of]{.mark} racial [difference as]{.mark} a
**[biological]{.mark} fact**]{.underline}, an essentializing claim that
critics said had been crucial to promoting oppression and inequality in
the past. [[Instead, today's]{.mark} **liberal [discourse]{.mark}**
[talks about]{.mark}]{.underline} institutional and
[**[structural]{.mark}** factors that contribute to
**[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, much as race theorists do.6 I
suggest that the [liberals [are **not**]{.mark} **simply [sweeping race
under the rug]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as many critics claim, [[but
taking a]{.mark} **crucial [step]{.mark}** [toward **solving**
the]{.mark} very **[problems]{.mark}** that concern them]{.underline}.

Many of the essays in the special issue examine specific empirical
questions about the role of race in international security affairs,
drawing flexibly on a variety of conceptual perspectives. This is a
constructive step forward as the field continues to debate its basic
theoretical assumptions and how it relates to mainstream IR. In
examining the latter issue, I will discuss in turn the empirical track
record of mainstream realist and liberal claims about some central
issues in international politics and security in light of challenges
from race-based theories. Then, I will discuss the connection between
these mainstream contributions to social identity theories on several
dimensions, including nationalism and the nation-state, modernization as
a force shaping political identity, the narrow utility of biological
race as a political concept, conceptual hybrids of biology and culture,
and several theories of ethnic conflict in common use in IR scholarship
that might broaden the critical discourse on race. I will conclude by
arguing that the "embedded liberalism" of the democratic welfare state
still offers the best response to the contemporary racial conundrums
identified by the critique of "embedded racism."7

Global Race War?

Much of the literature on race in international relations asks how
economic and status inequality between the white and nonwhite races can
be explained given that there is no functionally relevant biological
difference between so-called races. A prominent answer emphasizes white
exploitation of nonwhite people and societies and its enduring
legitimation by the historical legacy of prior racial mythmaking.8

A second puzzle dealing more directly with the core issues of the field
of security studies is what explains the "global race war" in which
white powers employ coercive force against nonwhite societies.9 This
comprises white colonialism and military interventionism in nonwhite
societies, white threat perceptions focused on racial difference, white
states' refusal to recognize the power and status of rising nonwhite
states, their use of international law and institutions to keep nonwhite
societies submissive, and their alliance favoritism toward white
powers.10 An ancillary puzzle is how realists, liberals, and other
mainstream scholars of international relations have been able to largely
ignore these issues of racial inequality, exploitation, and coercion.

Mainstream approaches to the study of war generally do not deny that
in-group favoritism and bias are factors that increase the likelihood of
war. Those scholars that focus on nationalism, ethnicity, or
social-psychological biases in perception accord a prominent place to
such factors. Sometimes race is mentioned in this context, but not as
a---or the---taproot of violence in the international system. The main
reason for this omission, often left implicit, is that so many of the
major wars these scholars study have involved white people on both
sides. Sometimes nonwhite people get caught up in the maelstrom, but
deadly rivalry between powerful white groups---usually nations and
states---is the core cleavage driving the struggle, not racial
difference or exploitation. Realists see threats to power and security
as the driver of such rivalries. These threats arise from strong
societies regardless of race, not from weak societies that are pawns in
the power game.11 For liberals, the driver of rivalry is domestic regime
type, which for historical reasons incidentally correlates loosely with
race, and the principles by which international relations is
institutionalized. In recent decades, these principles have featured
liberal, inclusive international regimes complicated by some powerful
illiberal states and transnational actors.12

At the moment, the two conflicts that have seized the imagination of
international security scholars are the war in Ukraine and the threat of
war between China and Taiwan. [**Ukraine** pits white
people]{.underline} and majority white countries [against **each
other**]{.underline} in a brutal contest that features atrocities
against civilians who are called "brothers." [It would be a **stretch**
to find a **race angle** here]{.underline}, and even the ethnic
difference is minimal. [The **[Taiwan]{.mark}** conflict [pits **white
America** against **nonwhite China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which was the
occasion for some race-baiting rhetoric from Donald Trump's
constituency, [**[but]{.mark}** the alliance [**partnerships** don't
**break**]{.mark} **down** [along **racial lines**. US]{.mark}
partners]{.underline} in this showdown [[include]{.mark} the **[Chinese
in Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the US allied states of [[**Japan**
and **So**]{.mark}uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}, Australia (yes,
part of the "Anglosphere"), and to some extent Vietnam, India,
[and]{.underline} intermittently [the Philippines. **[This is about
power]{.mark}**, security, and regime type, and only]{.underline}
incidentally and [**inconsistently** about **race**]{.underline}.

The main historical struggles for hegemony in the international system
tell a similar story. In World War I, all the main protagonists were
majority white, although \[nonwhite people\] ~~nonwhites~~ fought in
some of their armies, Turkey participated eventually, and nonwhite
populations such as the Herero of present-day Namibia were victimized
before and during the war. Sometimes scholars of race will imply, taking
a leaf from Lenin's book, that World War I was really a contest among
white imperialists to determine which of them would get the prize of
exploiting the economically less developed parts of the world.13 Some
historians have accorded a significant role to this part of the story.14
Indeed, one of my own myths of empire was the El Dorado myth that
colonies in Mittelafrika, for example, would become Germany's India, a
"place in the sun" that would add greatly to its wealth and power. This
was more myth than a decisive practical interest. German settler
colonization hopes were pinned mainly on the black earth of Ukraine and
Eastern Europe, where whites, not Africans, would need to be ousted.15

Imperial archives suggest that [the "**[scramble for
Africa]{.mark}**"]{.underline} in the 1990s [[was]{.mark} motivated
[**more** by]{.mark} the aim of controlling [**strategic** positions
along]{.mark} the **[Nile]{.mark}**, at **[Suez]{.mark}**, the Cape of
**Good Hope**]{.underline}, and coaling stations along the coast---also
myths, but [**[not]{.mark}** about **[racial
exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 Britain had normally preferred a
strategy of informal empire and indirect rule for reasons of economic
cost-effectiveness. The scramble for colonial control of territory in
Africa was triggered more by the rising power of imperial and naval
challengers to the strategy of informal empire which threatened these
strategic positions. Overall, [[the theory]{.underline}]{.mark} that
World War I [[was]{.mark} mainly [a **contest** to determine **which
racists** would get]{.mark} to **exploit** [the **riches**]{.mark} of
the nonwhite world **[misses the point]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Robert
Jervis always assigned his students the 1907 memorandum by
[British]{.underline} Foreign Office [diplomat]{.underline} Eyre Crowe
which [warned about [the]{.mark} rising]{.underline} industrial and
military [[**power** of **Germany**]{.mark} and]{.underline} its
unquenchable [ambition to **overturn** the balance of
**power**]{.underline} on the European continent.17 That [[**captures**
the **main**]{.mark} nonracial **[story]{.mark}** line. The [**racism**
of]{.mark} the European imperial [powers **is
relevant**]{.mark}]{.underline} for numerous aspects of the cataclysm
that was tragic for both whites and \[nonwhite people\] ~~nonwhites~~,
[[but]{.mark} it was [**not** the **primary
cause**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Racially motivated strife played a more prominent role in World War II,
as noted above. Nonetheless, the motivating factors and decisive
battlegrounds hinged on struggles among white Europeans and North
Americans. Notwithstanding Hitler's Aryan racism, his main ally was
Japan; he attacked Saxon England and declared war on the United States
whose immigrants had come more from Germany than from any other
nation.18 For all of Hitler's racism, Paul Kennedy makes a persuasive
case that Germany's continuing problem was being a middle-sized power
competing with two continental-sized powers, the US and the USSR.19
Japan's militarists already had learned the same lesson at the end of
World War I.20 They contended that Japan had to expand to become an
economically and militarily self-sufficient empire like America and
Soviet Russia to survive against these behemoths. These military
expansionists were a powerful but minority voice during much of the
1920s, when a coalition of export-oriented light industry, urban
workers, and the liberalizing Minseito Party coalesced around the pro-US
Foreign Minister Shidehara. He stood for naval arms control, the US
policy of an Open Door in China, and gradual expansion of the electoral
franchise but his diplomacy collapsed after 1929 along with the world's
stock markets and free trade. The ruling labor-export coalitions in
Taisho Japan and Weimar Germany were then replaced in a shift to
militarized heavy industry and a plan for military expansion to directly
control the resources and markets that these mid-sized countries needed
for self-sufficiency.21

Despite sitting on opposites sides of the racial divide, Germany and
Japan responded similarly as middle-sized powers vulnerable to the
vagaries of pre-Keynesian liberal capitalist world markets.
Sophisticated versions of realist and liberal theories shed a great deal
of light on this. Japan claimed that its objective was the creation of a
nonwhite Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, but its aggression and
atrocities in China showed that the real motivating interests were
narrowly Japanese, not pan-Asian racial solidarity.

Overall, realist theory and liberalism contribute key concepts for
explaining international relations in this period. Theories anchored on
race stumble for one of the same reasons that Samuel Huntington's clash
of civilization thesis did: history records more major conflicts within
civilizations and broad racialized groups than between them.

Modernization, Nationalism, and The Nation-State

A key reason for the secondary influence of race is that large-scale
group enmity and bias in the modern era have been based more on the unit
of the nation-state than on the politically amorphous categories of race
and civilization. In modern times, the most effective units of
governance, military power, economic organization, and ideological
mobilization have been nation-states. These are the units whose security
and prosperity mainly determines the fate of peoples, and therefore the
ones that most people leverage for advantage and are willing to fight
and die for. This is not to say that race matters for nothing, but for
the questions of war, peace, and international hegemony, it matters
mainly in the context of the politically primary loyalty to the
nation-state.

Between the sixteenth and mid-nineteenth century white European
societies parlayed some modest advantages in economic productivity and
institutional capacity into a completely revolutionary system of
economic and social organization. This increased their efficiency and
power exponentially in comparison to other societies, many of which
happened to be nonwhite. Europeans did this mainly through the
development of institutions that were far more effective in harnessing
science and technology to economic production and political authority.
They included the direct-rule state, constitutional government,
capitalism, legal institutions, mass education, mass nationalism, mass
armies, and naval and commercial maritime infrastructure.22

This same period also saw the rise of European nationalisms as the newly
dominant form of political allegiance that soon transformed the globe.
The prevailing theories of why this form of identity politics took hold
are based not on race but on the interaction of national-scale culture
and institutional developments of modernity: Benedict Anderson on
print-capitalism in the vernacular language, Ernest Gellner on the
functional need for cultural homogenization to make modern capitalism
and industrialism work, Michael Hechter on the culturally centralizing
direct-rule state, Daniel Nexon on the Protestant Reformation's breaking
up medieval empires and Papal authority, and Charles Tilly on the
military levée en masse that bound the state to its people.23 Anthony
Marx argues that the wars of religion in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries homogenized the culture of western European states which paved
the way for the development of civic nationalism in Britain and France
in the eighteenth century.24 The fact that the white European
nation-states produced by these processes went on to conquer large parts
of the globe inhabited by genetically diverse people does not prove that
the central form of identity politics shaping key issues of war and
economic development was racial rather than ethnic or national. These
conquests were national projects carried out with much rivalry among the
white nations.

Race and Ethnicity

After the end of the Cold War, mainstream IR scholars began to explore
identity politics in the form of ethnicity and nationalism. This
occurred for fortuitous as well as theory-driven reasons. Just as great
power conflict was in a lull, ethnic conflict was suddenly ubiquitous as
the result of the breakup or weakening of state structures. Realist
theories of group rivalry in anarchy provided natural explanations for
the competition of ethnic groups to build a state to protect their
interests.25 Historical research on the great powers made realists well
aware of the power of nationalism. Liberal institutionalists and social
constructivists, for their part, wrote about problems of building
nation-states out of ethnic peoples using their own distinctive
concepts, including borrowings from economics, psychology, sociology,
and discourse theory.26

Scholars who criticize mainstream IR for ignoring the topic of race do
not consider this significant outpouring of theory and research since
1990 on the topic of ethnicity and nation-building.27 This is a missed
opportunity for cross-fertilization, because IR scholars understand
ethnicity in a way that is not incompatible with the way scholars of
racism understand race. Work on ethnicity can help scholars of race deal
with a paradox in one of their most common claims: the puzzle of how
fictional, widely disavowed arguments about the innate social
characteristics of races can retain their persuasive power. Scholarship
on ethnicity can also suggest ways to get more analytical leverage out
of the most distinctive feature of race, namely indelibly observable
physical difference.

Sometimes ethnic identities are highly racialized in racist ideology as
purportedly biological (Hutu and Tutsi), sometimes partially racialized
(combining the myth of common descent with cultural practices and
historical myths), and sometimes not racialized at all (Russians and
Ukrainians).28 To unpack these issues, a first step is to ask what kind
of identity race is, and what if anything distinguishes it from other
categories of social identity such as ethnicity, caste, and nationality.
This is important for assessing what is at stake in the critics' claim
that the belief in the biological basis of racial inferiority was
crucial for legitimating imperial domination.

In contemporary American usage, race normally implies a group with
distinctive, observable physical features, but in older usage from the
era of Social Darwinism and European colonialism, the word race was
often used loosely to characterize a group of people with shared
attributes. Those might be based on any combination of observable
physical features, putative common descent, and/or common language,
culture, habits, and history, including such amorphous identities as the
"Teutonic" or the "Slavic" race. This definition is similar to
contemporary social-science definitions of ethnicity, which typically
treat common descent in large-scale "imagined communities" as mostly a
myth.29 Gene pools and phenotypes of any supposed group have a great
deal of variation, boundaries that are blurry at best, and offer no
objective behavioral implications that are directly relevant for
politics.30

A narrower usage of the term race, closer to historical American
domestic usage, focuses on observable physical features assumed to be
widely shared by members of the group as well as socially relevant
attributes said to be inherited at birth which are hard to change or
dissemble. Contemporary social science treats these as categories that
are socially constructed through discourses that reify characteristics
and imbue them with social implications through law or custom.31
Nonetheless, insofar as individuals may closely approximate the
observable ideal-type of a member of a supposed racial group, some
individuals may have little choice but to accept a socially imposed
identity based on the assumptions others make about them. Moreover,
since these observables are plausibly seen as inherited at birth and
unchangeable, they illogically feed into a discourse that portrays
social behaviors---especially negatively evaluated ones---as inbred and
unchangeable defects. Conversely, this same illogical leap can be used
to generate positive expectations that individuals sharing observable,
inherited traits will be natural and therefore reliable political
allies, and readily identifiable.32 Since physical observables such as
skin color and physical features are quite variable across individuals,
who often do not fit the stereotype, ethnic and even racial identity can
be made more observable and enforceable by costumes, dietary rules,
identity cards, and laws.33 The segregationists' "one drop of blood"
rule, for example, can be observed and enforced only through conventions
and law. This may be done for purposes of boundary policing by ingroups
to increase solidarity and common fate. It may be performed by outgroups
for purposes of discrimination and exploitation.

The narrower aspect of race or ethnicity as physically observable
difference has been explored productively by scholars of ethnicity who
are well known in mainstream IR circles. Karl Deutsch argued that such
observable distinctions are a cheap and fairly effective way to
distinguish whom you should trust or distrust.34 Barry Posen and Ernest
Gellner argued that the collapse of Communist state institutions left
ethnicity as the default category for forming social trust groups,
setting off a violent competition for ethnic state-building.35

Turning to the more general issue of how to understand the relationship
of biology and culture in social identity, important recent theoretical
approaches to identity construction are based on hybrids of kinship and
culture. Kanchan Chandra's self-described "constructivist" theory of
ethnic politics reminds us that people inherit not only skin color and
other superficial biological markers, but also legal nationality, caste,
religion, and other hard-to-change attributes.36 Her theory is
constructivist in the sense that people exercise agency in choosing to
emphasize some of these sticky identity attributes over others in trying
to form minimum winning coalitions in politics. Thus, if emphasizing a
common religion with a swing group will help me forge a winning
identity-based coalition, I'll highlight that aspect of my identity, but
if highlighting caste will get me the ally I need to win, I'll feature
that. Using similar concepts in a balance of power context, Lars-Erik
Cederman and Fotini Christia have shown how alliance needs determined
whether rhetorical frames featured geographic, tribal, ethnic, language,
religious, or historic appeals to common identity.37 In their South Slav
and Afghan case studies, a racial framing was not especially useful
because everyone on all sides was of a similar race.38 Perhaps the
reason that ethnicity has generally proved to be more effective than
race as a tool for political mobilization is its adaptability and its
connection to the cultural and social tools on the territorial scale of
the state that are at the heart of politics.

Critical race theory in IR typically tries to reconcile the biological
and cultural dimensions of identity politics through ideological
manipulation that inculcates a false consciousness. Stronger groups use
their propaganda and material advantages to instill the
taken-for-granted assumption of a natural racial hierarchy of status,
resources, and coercive power which structures the psychology and
interactions of members of both high and low status groups. As Vitalis
noted, this is generally the kind of argument I put forward about the
myths of empire (though in a nation-state context, not a racial one), so
I am certainly not opposed in principle to this approach.39

The difficulty starts, however, at the point where the leading voices in
the dominant white group come to disbelieve and publicly renounce the
biological ideology of racial superiority. As Vitalis and other critical
race theorists generally acknowledge, [authoritative
**[mainstream]{.mark}** commentators in [**liberal societies** abandoned
overtly **racialized discourse** by]{.mark} the
**19[60s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.40 [Critical **race [theorists]{.mark}**
[interpret this as **switching**]{.mark} at that point [to]{.mark}
cultural, **[functional]{.mark}**, or procedural **legitimations** of
[continued **white**]{.mark} authority and
**[privilege]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this view, instead of sticking
with unpersuasive claims of biological superiority, justifiers of
racially unequal economic and social outcomes made a tactical retreat to
the argument that equal opportunity under conditions of
nondiscrimination would take time to produce an equalization of
outcomes. Given the history of racial inequality, white propagandists
and their audiences could believe that it would take a while for
nonwhite people and societies to develop the attitudes and skills that
would lead to equal outcomes. [[In **one form** or another]{.mark},
according to critical race arguments, [the]{.mark} **corrosive
[legacy]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the old [biological myth]{.mark} has
**[lingered on]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Vitalis argued that my "blowback"
argument for the entrenchment of imperial myths was similar to the
endurance of the idea of biological racial superiority,
[**[but]{.mark}** the difference is that [the **imperialists**]{.mark} I
studied [**never stopped** believing in]{.mark} their myths of
**[security]{.mark}** through expansion **[whereas]{.mark}** mainstream
authoritative whites [**abandoned biological racist** ideology]{.mark}
**entirely**]{.underline}.41

[The **more convincing** part of critical race theory is [the
**durability** of]{.mark} social [**structures** that put]{.mark}
\[**[nonwhite people]{.mark}**\]]{.underline} ~~nonwhites~~ [[at a
**disadvantage**]{.underline}]{.mark} such as historic economic
precarity and lack of social network ties. [This [is a strong
**explanation** for]{.mark} continued [**inequality**, but]{.mark} it
**[lacks]{.mark}** an account of [the]{.mark} more active, [**conscious
dimensions** of]{.mark} continuing **[racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
an era when respectable cultural conservatives prefer to invoke the
rhetoric of individual rights--- religious rights, the "right to life,"
and affirmative action as discrimination---instead of crudely racist
diatribes, [[it seems likely]{.mark} that more general theories of
**[group bias]{.mark}**, group [**psychology**, and
**not**]{.mark}-specifically-[**racial** identity **politics** are in
play. These include the]{.mark} kind of **[theories]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} sociologists, psychologists, and [mainstream **[IR
scholars]{.mark}** have [been **exploring**]{.mark} in connection
[with]{.mark} ethnic **political [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What might some of these mechanisms be? Some possibilities that have
gained traction in these fields see outgroup bias as resulting from
intellectual shortcuts used by the perceiver, group members' need for
self-esteem, realistic resource rivalry, the relationship between
security and status, and misplaced resentments in situations of
declining group status and prosperity. While these mechanisms can be
heightened and exploited by dominant elites or political entrepreneurs
playing the racial or ethnic card, they constitute a potentially
self-regenerating reservoir of rivalry and outgroup denigration. Here
are some commonly studied mechanisms that seem applicable to both race
and ethnicity.

Overgeneralizing inferences of inferiority. The reigning theory of
racism in sociology advanced by a former President of the American
Sociological Association, Cecilia Ridgeway, argues that racism results
from overgeneralized dispositional attributions for subpar performance
on some indicators of competence that fail to take into account
situational explanations.42 When people observe others' deficits of
performance or capacity in some areas, they tend to attribute these to
the person's innate attributes rather than past circumstances affecting
opportunities to gain competence, so they generalize from the observed
area of weakness to an overall judgment of inferiority. When these
presumed deficits correlate with a group identity, the inference of
inferiority attaches to the group as a whole.

Attribution bias leading to essentializing and blaming the other.
Overgeneralizing inferiority is related to a more basic psychological
tendency called the fundamental attribution error. People tend to
explain their own behavior in terms of the situational constraints and
opportunities they face, which they see as the salient factors when they
are making choices. But when explaining the behavior of others, it is
the person who is salient, and it is difficult for observers to
reconstruct the situation that the other is facing. Therefore, causal
attributions for the other's behavior focus on the person's
disposition.43 Thus, people tend to explain others' behavior in
essentializing ways. As a corollary, people also tend to believe that
things that others do that harm them are done on purpose. Likewise, they
believe that the other's decision making is more centralized and more
carefully planned than it really is.44 Donald Horowitz, the dean of
ethnic conflict scholars, wrote an exhaustively researched book on urban
rioting that used in part this kind of attribution bias to understand
why ethnic rivals blame the other side for conflicts: We did it because
we had no choice; they did it because that's just the kind of people
they are.

Resource competition, status, and exploitation. People compete with and
exploit each other in groups. "Realistic conflict theory" grew out of
the Robbers Cave experiment in which white, middle-class teenage
American boys were randomly assigned to competing teams involving sports
and prizes at summer camp.45 They quickly developed a nasty rivalry that
led to discrimination, harassment, theft, and essentializing denigration
of the out-group. In the real world, Horowitz argues that ethnic groups
worldwide are spontaneously obsessed with ranking their own attributes
such as diligence, trustworthiness, and cleanliness compared to the
attributes of neighboring groups out of fear that a poor reputation will
be taken as a justification for exclusion, discrimination, and in the
extreme case extermination.46

Social identity theory and status anxiety. Henri Tajfel conducted
"minimal group experiments" showing that functional cooperation in tasks
and competition for prizes were unnecessary to produce favoritism toward
an arbitrarily chosen in-group and denigration of out-group members.47
He and his followers have argued that people are obsessed with
self-esteem and social status, and the status position of even the most
arbitrary group association affects the individual member's sense of
pride or shame.

Research on anti-immigrant and anti-minority attitudes among far-right
populists in wealthy democracies finds a connection to wealth and status
losses that are due to deindustrialization, changes in gender roles, and
rapid cultural change. These are displaced onto immigrants and
minorities who are seen as competing with them and passing them by.48
Political entrepreneurs may exploit this opportunity to play the
identity card, whether racial, ethnic, or nativist. This may be easier
in places where historical legacies have ideologically primed such
enmities have been ideologically primed by historical legacies, or as in
Denmark, they may be new. This kind of mechanism might be compatible
with critical race theory, or it might require some qualifications to
it. Overall, mainstream IR research on ethnicity might be a useful
source of findings relevant to race that have already proved serviceable
in applications to security studies topics.

Implications for Combating Racism in World Politics

Returning to my starting point with Amitav Acharya's views on race and
international relations: It is difficult to disagree with the balanced,
meticulous recommendations for greater diversity, inclusion, and
tolerance of difference in international relations and its study that he
laid out in his 2014 ISA presidential address.49 Any multicultural
scheme for social harmony must have a way of dealing with inevitable
conflicts of norms and interests. In liberal multicultural systems, the
aspiration is for liberal regulatory rules to serve an adjudicating
function in a colorblind way. Acharya's model, however, lacks an arbiter
in this role. He endorses [[the
**live-and-let-live**]{.underline}]{.mark} ASEAN
[[system]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is]{.mark} all [**too tolerant**
of]{.mark} rights-abusing **[authoritarian rule]{.mark}**]{.underline},
plus the rhetorically benign Bandung principles of the old nonaligned
movement. Alas, the current reincarnation of nonaligned developing
powers has been more transactional than principled during the current
crisis of the "liberal international order." They have mostly focused on
keeping their heads down and tending to national interests while the
illiberal powers and democratic backsliders do their worst. While few
want a rerun of "the unipolar moment" in which an American Don Quixote
tries to impose liberal order on the world by force, [at the moment
[**liberal states** offer]{.mark} the [**only prospect** for]{.mark}
effective **leadership** of [an inclusive]{.mark}, multicultural
[coalition for]{.mark} **human [rights]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} political
**[accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.50

Although "embedded liberalism" gets a mention [[in]{.mark} the
**[critical]{.mark}** race **[theory of IR]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is
not an honorable mention. Rather, embedded [[liberalism is]{.mark} seen
as [a **smokescreen** for]{.mark} what is really going on: "**[embedded
racism]{.mark}**." [Liberalism **remains**]{.mark} largely
[**undifferentiated** in]{.mark} much of [this literature. Unregulated
**neolib**]{.mark}**eralism** [and **libertarianism** do not come off
as]{.mark} either **better or [worse]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} the
**[liberalism]{.mark}** of the **welfare state**. [The **legacy** of
racially **inclusive reforms**]{.mark} of the
1960s---**[decolonization]{.mark}**, the US [**civil rights**
laws]{.mark}, the racially inclusive US **[immigration law]{.mark}**,
the \[**[IC]{.mark}EAFRD**\] International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination---[is **written off** as a]{.mark}
tactical [**adjustment of racism**. But what **racial theory**]{.mark}
**of IR** [sees as **smokescreens** are]{.mark} actually [**struggles**
between **different liberalisms**, some]{.mark} of which are [**worthy
of support** as]{.mark} potential [**solutions** to]{.mark} the [problem
of]{.mark} **global** and **domestic** [racism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Black constituencies in the US understand this. The decisive factor that
saved Joe Biden's struggling presidential campaign based on an
inclusive, mainstream, welfare-state platform was Black turnout in the
South Carolina Democratic primary in response to Black Congressman James
Clyburn's endorsement.

Perhaps most necessary in a theory based on the racist hijacking of the
democratic marketplace of ideas, critical race theory should ramp up its
study of how the news media works, who gets to dominate its bully pulpit
in liberal societies, and how this can be fixed.51 Should the U.S. or
the European Union impose legal regulation of media, reintroducing
mechanisms like the broadcast "Fairness Doctrine" of the Federal
Communications Commission that backstopped an era of relative sanity in
US public discourse between 1949 and 1987?52 Or should we have absolute
freedom of speech, even for Alex Jones on Infowars? Should we prefer to
have Walter Cronkite or Elon Musk exercising their judgment on
newsworthiness?53 Or do critical race theory proponents think there is
simply no way to keep the racists from prevailing in a liberal
capitalist society?

Overall, [[the **implication**]{.mark} that [liberal **hegemony** lies
at]{.mark} the [**core** of]{.mark} the problem of **[racism]{.mark}**
in world politics [**seems unwarranted**. It is true]{.mark} that some
**liberal [systems]{.mark}** [are structured]{.mark} in part [by]{.mark}
the **legacy** of a [racist **past**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Liberal
societies comprise a diversity of views, some of them unsavory, some of
them merely self-interested. Liberal parties tend to favor affirmative
action to compensate for the past, but they operate in a politically
competitive environment where this looks unfair to those who feel they
are losing out, risking backlash that can lead to even worse outcomes.
Liberal markets do not automatically solve problems of economic
inequality among citizens of different races or of the same race.
Liberal states coexist with ruthlessly illiberal states in an anarchic
international system that is at best partially organized around liberal
rules. [**[Despite]{.mark}** all [these **challenges**, the most
**feasible prescription**]{.mark} for combating **racism** in
contemporary world politics **[remains]{.mark}** at the moment
[the]{.mark} basic [**liberal formula** of reforming]{.mark} social
[**systems** to depend]{.mark} more [on **rule-based**]{.mark} social
relations, **[equality]{.mark}** before the law, [and]{.mark} democratic
**[accountability]{.mark}** of the **government** to the
people.]{.underline}

\[\[Title\]\]

Yet this trivial episode invites us to think seriously about the role of
covert intervention and regime change in U.S. policy. [[Just as]{.mark}
the [U.S. sought to **undermine**]{.mark} or topple **unfriendly
[regimes]{.mark}** [during]{.mark} the [Cold War, it may]{.mark}
**look** to such methods [**again** in]{.mark} its increasingly heated
[**rivalry** with **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Caution will be
necessary: History tells us that while covert intervention can sometimes
be a cost-effective tool of competition, it is fraught with risks and
profound moral trade-offs.

Covert action came of age [[during]{.mark} the **[Cold
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the late 1940s, when [the
**[CIA]{.mark}**]{.underline} and National Security Council were born,
the U.S. began developing a global capability for intervention under the
cloak of secrecy. Over the succeeding decades, it [[would]{.mark} seek
to [**destabilize** or replace]{.mark} numerous **[governments]{.mark}**
that were [**slipping** into]{.mark} the [Soviet
sphere]{.mark}]{.underline} or softening up their countries for
communist influence. [[The U.S. **didn't** do this
**gratuitously**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or to protect American
investments overseas. [[Washington resorted to covert action
because]{.mark} its **[leaders believed]{.mark}** that [the]{.mark}
**geopolitical [balance]{.mark}** [was **fragile** and]{.mark} that the
[U.S. **needed affordable** methods of **competing**]{.mark} along a
nearly **global periphery**. And because **waging** that struggle
against a **ruthless enemy** in an often-unstable Third World might
require **fighting dirty**, America must be able to do so in **quiet**,
non-attributable **ways**]{.underline}.

The CIA successfully overthrew, or helped overthrow, governments in
Guatemala and Iran in the 1950s. It prosecuted a shadowy struggle from
Central America to southern Africa to Afghanistan through the end of the
1980s. In most cases, the U.S. subverted communist or other unfriendly
authoritarian regimes, but it also targeted democratically
elected leaders such as Chile's Salvador Allende, who were seen as
taking the wrong side in the Cold War. "We are facing an implacable
enemy whose avowed objective is world domination," a classified report
on CIA operations concluded in 1954. "There are no rules in such a game.
Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply."

Yet that same statement showed why covert action felt awkward --- even
morally reprehensible --- to many Americans. The CIA suffered severe
blowback in the 1970s, when revelations of its role in Chile and its
efforts to assassinate foreign leaders came to light.

After the Cold War, covert intervention receded in importance. According
to published reports, the U.S. sought covert options for toppling the
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and other sworn enemies. Absent the Soviet
threat, however, the geopolitical imperatives of competing for influence
everywhere became less pressing.

[Meanwhile, the spread of **democracy** and the rise of **overt tools**
for **promoting** it, such as the quasi-autonomous National Endowment
for Democracy, gave the U.S. less **morally ambiguous** ways of shaping
political **outcomes**]{.underline}. Why send spooks to influence an
election in Georgia or Ukraine when Washington could send
nongovernmental groups and election monitors instead? As Allen
Weinstein, a founder of the National Endowment for Democracy, said, "A
lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA."

[It's **not so easy** anymore. American [officials can **no longer
assume**]{.mark} the [inevitable emergence of a]{.mark} **friendlier**,
more [**democratic** world]{.mark}. U.S. [**competition** with
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and, to a lesser degree, Russia) [[is
intensifying]{.mark} and **sprawling** geographically. A few **years**
from now, [Washington might]{.mark} find itself [**desperately**
seek]{.mark}ing [**covert options** to prevent]{.mark} some important
[country in]{.mark} sub-Saharan [**Africa**, the **Middle
East** or]{.mark} Southeast [**Asia** from **aligning** with
**Beijing**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If that seems far-fetched, [consider how much the **U.S.-China rivalry**
has **escalated** over the past three years, and where that
**trajectory** might lead in another **decade**]{.underline}. Or
remember that U.S. policymakers of the late 1940s probably never
imagined that America would wage a complex covert struggle over Angola a
quarter-century later. One timeless rule of international politics is
that [strategic [**competition** takes countries **places** they may
**not** initially **expect**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or want, to go.

But is covert intervention a good idea? Some analysts argue that it
rarely works and should be avoided, yet this is probably the wrong
standard. Countries usually resort to covert action when other options
have either failed or are deemed undesirable, so the likelihood of
success is low to begin with. That built-in handicap notwithstanding,
the U.S. did, in some cases, get serious strategic mileage out of its
meddling.

In the late 1940s, covert support for democratic politicians in Italy
played a modest but probably important role in shoring up that country
against communist challenges at the polls. For the cost of a few hired
mobs, the U.S. facilitated the toppling of Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh of Iran in 1953, securing its strategic flank in the Persian
Gulf for 25 years. CIA support helped the Indonesian
military consolidate power after it toppled an increasingly
anti-American Sukarno in 1965, thus avoiding the prospect of Southeast
Asia's most important country turning hostile.

During the 1970s, when the Third World was convulsed by ideological
radicalism and the U.S. was experiencing its post-Vietnam hangover,
covert action was critical to holding the line. Finally, in the 1980s,
the Reagan administration used a wide-ranging covert offensive to
put intense pressure on Soviet clients in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and
Angola, and to drive up the costs of Moscow's global presence. Without
covert action, America might not have won the Cold War.

Unfortunately, some of [these **examples** also tell a **darker
story**]{.underline}. By aiding the Indonesian military in 1965, [the
U.S. **implicated** itself in **horrific violence**]{.underline} that
killed half a million people. The price the U.S. ultimately paid for
conspiring against Mossadegh and backing the shah of Iran was measured
in the enmity of the anti-American regime that took power in 1979. [[The
U.S. supported some **decent**]{.mark} **people** fighting against
Communist [regimes in the]{.mark} **19[80s]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} some
[**truly awful** ones as well]{.mark}]{.underline}, including some who
would go on to play an important role in a blossoming international
jihad. And in destabilizing Allende's regime in the early 1970s, the
U.S. helped extinguish Chilean democracy for nearly two decades.

The nature of covert intervention is that it is difficult to be choosy
in one's partners or their methods, which can create a moral mess for a
democratic superpower. A sense that almost anything would be better than
ascendant communism led the U.S. to embrace expedients --- authoritarian
regimes, efforts to kill foreign leaders such as Patrice Lumumba in the
Congo or Fidel Castro in Cuba --- that were ugly. When that happened,
covert action could become a cause of anti-Americanism in the Third
World rather than a solution for it.

Not least, because covert operations are high-risk endeavors, they can
backfire spectacularly. The U.S. created some of its own problems in
Indonesia in the 1950s by trying, and failing, to spur a separatist
movement against Sukarno's government. The Bay of Pigs fiasco in
1961 pushed Castro to undertake a covert offensive of his own, meant to
overthrow U.S. allies in Latin America. It also caused Nikita Khrushchev
to deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba, leading to the most dangerous crisis
of the Cold War.

[One **tragedy** of [geopolitical **rivalry**]{.mark} is that it often
[presents]{.mark} **great [powers]{.mark}** [with **unappealing**
choices]{.mark}. The alternative to a **bad outcome** may be one that is
**worse**, both **morally** and strategically. That's why the U.S. so
often **resorted** to behind-the-scenes **intervention** in the Cold
War, and why it may prove useful in the future]{.underline}. But history
shows that covert action is no cure-all for a country's geopolitical
challenges. In some cases, it can produce tragedies of its own.

[**[characterizations]{.mark}** held [by]{.mark} so [many of]{.mark} the

for the evolution of the international system, and we do not in this
confined treatment offer an explanation for the origins of U.S. foreign
policy. In short, we offer an argument about impacts rather than the
sources of America's anti-imperial and pro-Westphalian role.

Empires and State Systems: Historical Patterns

Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world
politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no
global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent
imperial and colonial ventures connected desperate regional systems,
doing so approximately five hundred years ago.7 Prior to this emergence
of a global scope system, the pattern of world politics was
characterized by regional systems. These regional systems were initially
very anarchic, and marked by high levels of military competition. But
almost universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires
which had fairly limited interactions with polities outside their
regions.8 Thus, it was empires -- not anarchic state systems -- that
typically dominated the regional systems in all parts of the world.

Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order
was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.
Despite repeated efforts to consolidate Europe into one empire -- or
what the Europeans referred to as "universal monarchy" -- this region
remained a plural, multi-state political order. After the Peace of
Westphalia ending the Thirties Year War, this plural anarchic system,
the Westphalian system, and was sustained by a rough balance of power
among its autonomous states and the weakness of the claimants of
European empire. This Westphalian system was based on a roughly equal
distribution of power among its major units, sustained by various
balancing practices that thwarted a succession of regional European
empire-builders, and had an elaborate system of public international law
and ideological justification.9 While this system rested on a balance of
power, it was juridically crystallized into a system of mutually
recognized sovereigns.

Outside of Europe, however, the European states, including those that
were most active in preventing empire within Europe, were
extraordinarily successful in conquering and colonizing vast areas
across oceanic distances.10 The Europeans did not invent empire, but
they were spectacularly successful at empire building on a global scope,
largely because of the imbalance of power that stemmed from European
innovations in technology and organization.11 The Europeans conquered
and dominated empires, states, and peoples in every previously loosely
coupled or isolated regional system across the world. The Europeans also
successfully planted numerous colonies of settlers, mainly in the
temperate zones in North and South America, Oceania, and the southern
tip of Africa.12 States from the Western European core of the
Westphalian system thus brought into existence a global-scale political
system made up of vast multi-continental empires of conquered peoples
and a scattering of colonial "new Europes."13

This pattern of European empire building was different from its
predecessors, not just in its global scope, but also because the
European states were continuously warring against one another for
dominance within Europe. These struggles between states within Europe
against empire in Europe were fought on a global scale. Thus the first
"world war," defined as a war fought across multiple continents,
occurred in the later 18th century. In this struggle Britain sought to
thwart French attempts to dominate Europe and the battle lines were in
Europe, North America, South Asia, and across the global oceans. This
pattern of the globalization of intra-European warfare continued in the
20th century with the wars triggered by German efforts to dominate
Europe. The growing imbalance of power between the Europeans and the
rest of the world during the 18th and 19th century enabled the Europeans
to easily expand their empires at the expense of non-Europeans. But
during the same periods, the Europeans found it very difficult to
conquer each other within Europe. Thus vast armies wrought great
destruction fighting over tiny parcels of land in Europe, while
comparatively small European imperial expeditionary forces readily
mastered non-European armies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Thus a
balance of power underpinned the Westphalian system in Europe, while an
imbalance of power between Europe and the world underpinned imperial
expansion.

Anti-imperial and anti-colonial rebellions and resistance are as old as
empires, but successful rebellion against European imperial rule outside
Europe began in the 18th century with the revolt of the colonial settler
colonies in the Americas -- first in North America and then in South
America. This first wave of settler-colony rebellion marked the end of
what historians refer to as the "first British empire," as well as the
first great European empire in the Americas, that of Spain. The success
of this first wave of anti-imperial rebellion in Spanish America was
crucially facilitated by the weakening of Spain during the Napoleonic
wars for domination within Europe.

In the later-19th century, European empire building outside of Europe
entered a second wave, enabled by the new industrial technologies that
further amplified the imbalance of power between Europeans and
non-Europeans, which in turn allowed the Europeans to extend their
imperial domination into the large interior spaces of the continents,
particularly in Africa and Asia.14 In the 20th century, further wars
among the core European states weakened Britain, France, and Holland,
the leading European colonial powers, thus creating opportunities for
anti-imperial independence movements in Asia and Africa. Paradoxically,
the fact that the Europeans were continuously fighting one another
fueled their imperial ambitions and successes, while at the same time,
such wars weakened them and helped enable the success of rebellions
against their empires.15 Thus as the British empire was reaching its
territorial zenith in the early years of the 20th century, Britain was
critically weakened by the world wars in Europe and Asia against the
aspiring German and Japanese empire builders.

The territorial aggression of the Axis Powers constitute a third wave of
empire building which was short lived and thwarted by the successful
mobilization of the "United Nations," a coalition led by the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. A fourth wave of
empire building, by the Soviet Union and the international communist
movement in the second half of the 20th century, was thwarted and
dismantled by the United States and its allies.

The Pattern of American Anti-Imperial, Anti-Colonial, and
Pro-Westphalian Impacts

[[Against the]{.mark} backdrop of this evolution]{.underline} of the
international system [and the **four [waves]{.mark}** [of empire
**building**]{.mark} and **dismantlement**, it becomes possible to see
more **clearly** the many ways in which [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [played]{.mark} important **anti-imperial**,
[anti-**colonial**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and pro-Westphalian
[[roles]{.underline}]{.mark}. 16

[[In **each**]{.mark} of the four **[wave]{.mark}s** of empire building
and dismantlement, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates had an
**impact**]{.underline}. The United States was the first "new nation" to
emerge from a rebellion against European imperial rule during the first
wave of modern empire. [The **U**nited **S**tates also
[supported]{.mark} the [**independence** of]{.mark} other [European
**settler colonies**]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the Americas and,
[[with the **Monroe Doctrine**, helped **sustain**]{.mark} their
[**independence** against]{.mark} **European** [efforts to
**recolonize**]{.mark} parts of [the **Americas**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In the second wave of late 19th century empire-building, [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, despite its great
relative power, [[did **not establish** an **empire**]{.mark} of its
own]{.underline} of any significance or duration. And during the latter
part of the 20th century, [the **U**nited **S**tates [pushed]{.mark}
European **[decolonization]{.mark}**, thus **[facilitating]{.mark}** the
[breakup of]{.mark} second wave [empires]{.mark}. In the great **world
wars** in the 20th century, the **U**nited **S**tates played an
important **role** in [thwarting]{.mark} a third wave of [**imperial
projects** of **Germany**, Japan, and **Italy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the second half of the 20th century, the United States played decisive
roles, both ideological and military, in thwarting the fourth wave of
empire building, the expansion of the communist great power, the Soviet
Union, as well as communist coups and revolutions in many weak and small
independent states.

The United States also played a variety of important roles in building
and strengthening Westphalian institutions, moderating inter-state
anarchy, and facilitating the ability of states to survive as
independent members of international society. From its inception, the
United States was precocious in its [support for the **law of nations**,
the **institutions** of the society of states, particularly the **laws
of war** and neutrality, and public **international law**, as a means of
**restraining war** and aggression]{.underline}. In both the 19th and
20th centuries, [[the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates,
first regionally and then globally, **[inspired]{.mark}** and helped
legitimate **[anti-colonial]{.mark}** and anti-imperial [independence
**movements** and]{.mark} national **[liberation struggles]{.mark}**
among **peoples** struggling against empires **all over the
world**]{.underline}. In the 20th century, the United States led the
efforts to institutionalize Westphalian norms of non-aggression and
sovereign independence, first with the League of Nations and then with
the United Nations Charter. In the second half of the 20th century, the
American-led liberal international order institutionalized free trade
and multilateral cooperation, thus providing the infrastructure for a
global economic system, thus enabling smaller and weaker states to
sustain their sovereign. Also in the second half of the 20th century,
[the **American** system of military [**alliances** contributed
to]{.mark} the [**dampening** of]{.mark} violent **[conflicts]{.mark}**
among allied states, particularly in **Europe** and **East Asia**, thus
protecting the **Westphalian** system from the return of violent
conflict and **empire-building**.]{.underline}

Taken together, [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} varied American [activities

[**evidence** for our **claim**]{.mark} that the **U**nited **S**tates
has significantly contributed to the **dismantlement** of

Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth (2012)1 cover the nuances of the
terminology well, and I agree with their preference for the term "Deep
Engagement" that Joseph Nye coined in a 1995 article.2 The complex
patterns and nuances of engagement [remain **poorly understood**, with a
[focus on **conflict**]{.mark} that [ignores]{.mark} the
**preponderance** of [cases, where]{.mark} U.S. [forces have been
**peacefully based**]{.mark} for decades]{.underline}. In short,
[foreign policy has focused on the **heat** instead of the **light** --
[countless **studies**]{.mark}, essays, and books [on]{.mark} Vietnam,
Afghanistan, and **[Iraq]{.mark}** stand [in **contrast** to]{.mark} the
negligible [**attention** given to countries where]{.mark} the [U.S.
maintained **large**]{.mark}**-scale** and long-term **troop
[basing]{.mark}** [such as]{.mark} Belgium, [**Korea**, Turkey, and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Is the **U**nited **S**tates an **empire?** We **may** just **as well**
debate **whether** an **elephant** most closely **resembles** a
**T**yrannosaurus **Rex**]{.underline} or Triceratops. Some will point
to the imperial characteristics that are reflected in the United States
force posture.  But [characteristics of]{.underline} dinosaurs or
**[empires]{.underline}** (size, martial strength, breadth) really [have
**no meaning** in a world where that entire **order** is
**extinct**]{.underline}.  The 21st century is filled with a new order
of nation-states, markedly different from eras prior to 1945. 

American power is best understood not by its type: hard, soft, or smart,
but its motivation. This is not to say the "imperial" motivation has
disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and domination are
instinctive human qualities.  But there is a new aspect to international
relations that has been in place for more than a century, a form of
altruism, illustrated by the widespread support that exists in the U.S.
and other countries for universal human rights. For many decades now,
nations have routinely sought to advance something beyond their narrow
national interests. I call this a Promethean motivation, and America a
Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus -- repeatedly -- in order to help uplift the human race.

[[Critics]{.mark} of American **intervention** reflexively [use the term
"**imperial**"]{.mark} when discussing **foreign affairs**]{.underline}.
By far the dominant theme of imperialism in American foreign policy has
been voiced by Leftist thinkers such as Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce
Kolko, and Gore Vidal. But since 1990, the end of the Cold War,
[neo-**isolationists** on the **right** have **adopted** the term as
well]{.underline}, notably Pat Buchanan and Congressman Ron Paul. Thus
the tendency is for thinkers on the political extremes -- globalists on
the left, nationalists on the right -- to find common cause, whereas
centrists tend to view American power more favorably, as do many foreign
scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power."  The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." Hegemony refers to a coercive state, like an empire, but one
that aims to create mutually beneficial relationships. Trying to define
the nature of state power by the distribution of benefits (exploitative
or shared) misses the point. The point is: what are first principles
that motivate foreign action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. 
Consider again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more
than a poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James
Madison, "I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well
calculated as ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of
his final letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this
progress will stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been
receding before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I
trust, disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the advantage of the
empire and at the cost of the foreigners. And for the sake of clarity,
recognize a bright line that distinguishes imperial relationships as
those where subjugated peoples do not want but are forced to abide by
foreign intervention.  To be specific, [[the U.S. **role**]{.mark} in
South **Korea** [fails the]{.mark} **imperial [test]{.mark}**, as does
the post-1955 role of the U.S. in **Germany** and **Japan**. Those three
countries **accounted** for nearly **three-quarters** of U.S. troop
**deployments** since 1950. Not to mention **Spain**, Turkey,
**Taiwan**, and **Kuwait**. [All]{.mark} of these [are **voluntary
alliances**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and qualitatively distinct from forces
based in Iraq.

[[For]{.mark} the Leftist **[criticism]{.mark}** of American **empire**
[to hold, evidence of **domination** should be **easy**]{.mark} to
see]{.underline}. One would expect to see the countries of the world
that are occupied by American troops suffering economic decline as a
result, or at a minimum a relative decline.  [[Here]{.mark} **the
[critique falls]{.mark}** [apart]{.mark}. The [countries]{.mark} of the
world [that]{.mark} have **[hosted]{.mark}** the greatest number of
American **[troops]{.mark}** since 1950 [have **grown** the
**fastest**]{.mark} economically. Furthermore, **host countries** have

The record shows that [[America's **engagement**]{.mark} with allied
nations [is]{.mark} **unequivocally [beneficial]{.mark}** for those
countries]{.underline}. But the context is what matters for future
policy choices. [Public **[perceptions]{.mark}** of world affairs [are
dominated by]{.mark} **negatives**: [bombings in]{.mark} Iraqi
**[cities]{.mark}**, AIDS rampant in Africa,
**[genocides]{.mark}**]{.underline}, earthquakes. Foreign policy experts
focus on negatives of a subtler nature: the dilemma over Iran's pursuit
of nuclear weapons, the poppy trade and corruption in Afghanistan, the
strategic mystery that is China. [[Yet **despite**]{.mark} real and
looming [**crises**, the]{.mark} underlying **[theme]{.mark}** of the
American century [is]{.mark} a **patient** march of human
**[prosperity]{.mark}**, deepening and broadening as economic **growth
unfolds** in the free world.]{.underline}

The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S. troops,
even and especially when it is not self-interested, has benefitted our
allies and the world. America's engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945
created a security umbrella fostering peace and unprecedented
prosperity. If this model were applied to the Middle East -- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters -- it would reshape the region's
future for the better. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[[The **question**]{.underline}]{.mark} that haunts contemporary foreign
policy [[is **not** whether the]{.mark} U.S. [**military** is]{.mark} a
force for **[good]{.mark}** around the globe. [**It is**. The question
is: Can]{.mark} Promethean [power **be sustained**?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Nor can US]{.underline}]{.mark} involvement in [foreign **wars** and
**[interventions]{.mark}** usually [be traced to]{.mark} a
[**hegemonic** desire]{.mark} to spread **liberal values**]{.underline}.
A missionary attitude in foreign policy and liberal value promotion
agenda may help lay the groundwork or justify the public case for
unnecessary commitments and may be responsible for a few of them.
[**But** the largest **interventions**---Korea, [**Vietnam**, the **Gulf
War**]{.mark}, the Balkan wars, **Afghanistan**, [and **Iraq**---were
all]{.mark} **primarily [motivated]{.mark}** [by security]{.mark}
considerations]{.underline}.19 [[Some]{.mark} of these]{.underline}
actions [**[may]{.mark}** have [be]{.mark}en **[excessive]{.mark}** to
begin with or become so]{.underline} over time, [[and]{.mark}
the]{.underline} security [**concerns** that drove them may have been

**fears**. [But they were **not fueled** by]{.mark} the boundless
commitment to **[primacy]{.mark}** and **liberal value**
promotion]{.underline} described by many advocates of restraint.

Limits to Ambition: By the Numbers

Broadly speaking, then, [[the **default**]{.mark} **setting** of US
foreign policy [is **hardly**]{.mark} one of fervent
[interventionism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In terms of actual military
posture and spending, if the United States had truly embraced hegemonic
policies, there would be a trajectory of continually rising commitments,
military spending, and interventions since 1945. Yet the actual record
is starkly different. Table 1 tells an interesting story about one key
focus of the restraint proponents---global military presence.

[[Between]{.mark} the late 19[**80s** and]{.mark} roughly
**[2018]{.mark}**, US [troop levels **declined**]{.mark}]{.underline}
slightly in Japan, more than 40 percent in Korea, and 80 percent in
Europe. [The [result was]{.mark} that]{.underline}, as the Pew Research
Center put it, by 2016 [the "U.S. military **overseas** presence \[was\]
at [a]{.mark} **60-year [low]{.mark}**," falling well **[below
200,000]{.mark}** after having reached a peak of **1.2
million**]{.underline} in the late 1960s and remaining at over 600,000
as recently as 1990. In 2016, only 15 percent of active-duty US military
troops were deployed overseas---the lowest proportion since 1957.21

[One partial **exception** to this trend, of course, is the **Middle
East**]{.underline}, where after a history of "extremely light force
presence" 22 before 1990, US regional deployments expanded across the
region in the wake of the Gulf War and ramped up dramatically during the
Iraq War. Various factors---including the flow of units into and out of
the region, the use of private contractors to fulfill some functions,
and limits on public information---make it impossible to put a precise
figure on US deployments; the Congressional Research Service has
estimated that as of 2019, there were 60,000 to 80,000 US troops in the
Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility.23 [Yet **even here**,
these numbers are **well down** from the recent peak: the
**[Obama]{.mark}** administration's **[withdrawal]{.mark}** of most US
combat **forces** [from Iraq meant]{.mark} that **[numbers]{.mark}**
there **[plummeted]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

from over 160,000 in 2006-- 07 to residual levels by 2012.24

The story of [US [defense **spending**]{.mark} from **1988** to **9/11**
is also one of **gradual decline**]{.underline}. All told,
"inflation-adjusted military spending fell by one-third in the 1990s."
25 [The defense budget [shows]{.mark}]{.underline} a similar pattern
over a longer time period---[[a downward slope]{.mark} from]{.underline}
about [16 percent of GDP]{.underline} in the early 1950s [to **less**
than **3 percent**]{.underline} by the end of the 1990s, and then,
[[after a bump from **9/11**]{.mark} and the **war on terror**, [back
down]{.mark}]{.underline} to 3.1 percent in 2018.26 (Even before the
current pandemic, the Congressional Budget Office had projected a
further decline to 2.8 percent of GDP by 2029.27) [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [**also** took]{.mark} advantage
of [the end of]{.mark} the [Cold War to **slash** its nuclear
**arsenal**]{.mark} from a peak of **31,255** weapons [to **fewer** than
**5,000**]{.mark}]{.underline}.28

Therefore, had [an advocate of **[restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}
called [[in]{.mark} **19[89]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a one-third cut
in defense spending, an 80 percent reduction in troops in Europe, and an
85 percent cut in the US nuclear arsenal, they [would have
[got]{.mark}ten [**everything** they asked for]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Restraint proponents would doubtless suggest that spending remains too
high and that US global posture---with hundreds of bases and deployments
across dozens of countries---remains too elaborate. Both may be true,
and further cuts may be called for. But [[the **record** of US]{.mark}
foreign [policy does **not reflect** a one-way trajectory]{.mark} of
**defense** posture and **spending** [in service of **primacy**]{.mark}
and liberal **hegemony**]{.underline}.

### AT: Link\-\--Deterrence\-\--2AC

#### Deterrence is a necessary precondition for ethics\-\--abolishing uncertainty creates a violent vacuum of structure that gets replaced with more violent organization.

**Lundborg 19**, Ph.D. in International Politics, Associate Professor of
Political Science and Director of Studies at the Swedish Defense
University (Tom Lundborg, 2019, "The ethics of neorealism: Waltz and the
time of international life," European Journal of International
Relations, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 229-49, University of Kansas Libraries,
Sage Journals)

Crucially, [[if we could know **for certain** what states **will
do**]{.mark} on the basis of either the **structure** of the system or
some predetermined **motives**]{.underline} of the subjects within the
system, [the **uncertainty** of international life would **disappear**
and the ['**politics**']{.mark} of international politics [would
**lose**]{.mark} **its [meaning]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14 Rather than
trying to rectify the lack of certainty by creating a stronger sense of
certainty, [[it is]{.mark} therefore [**imperative** to affirm]{.mark}
the [**uncertainties** created by the **system**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is important, moreover, to oppose the distinction between ethical
desirability and political possibility, since the reproduction of this
distinction blocks from view the conditions of international life that
make ethical thinking and action possible in the first place.

Positivist social science and liberal interpretations of Kant are thus,
very crudely put, the main obstacles to grasping the ethics of
international life. In resisting both moves, neorealism does not seek to
close down the violent opening of ethics inherent in the structure of
anarchy, for example, by formulating metaphysical ideals informing
states how they should act or how they ought to become friends rather
than enemies. [[There can be **no absolute** friendship]{.mark} between
**states**, and **no state** can ever offer absolute **hospitality** to
another state. [At the **heart** of every]{.mark} inter-state
**[relation]{.mark}**, there [is **mistrust**]{.mark}, uncertainty and
incalculability. [To]{.mark} positively [**affirm the latter** is **not
to say**]{.mark} that [uncertainty]{.mark} or **incalculability [is good
per se]{.mark}**[. Rather]{.mark}, it **implies** that [they are]{.mark}
seen as basic and [**irrefutable conditions** of international
life]{.mark}, which, consequently, are **not** even **desirable** to
overcome]{.underline}. Hence, it also implies that as long as there is
international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow of the future
\[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting states' (Waltz,
2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to this shadow should not be
read as an expression of determinism. It expresses rather an affirmation
of uncertainty: the 'uncertainty of each about the other's future
intentions and actions' (Waltz, 1979: 105).

In order to give friendship in international politics a chance, so to
speak, the possibility that a friend suddenly becomes an enemy must
never be eliminated. Attempts to create absolute trust in inter-state
relations are therefore not only impossible to achieve in the practical
sense, but essentially undesirable.15 Along similar lines, Derrida
explains how friendship is possible only if one remains open to the
deception of the other, since it is precisely the unconditional openness
to whatever may happen in the encounter between self and other that
makes it possible to develop any sort of friendship in the first place
(Derrida, 2005: 219).

Even if we were to accept Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between
different 'cultures of anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than
others, it is not self-evident that a culture in which friendship is
prioritized over enmity is actually a better one. This is because in
order to exclude the possibility that a friend may suddenly become an
enemy, one must first eliminate the time of international life that
makes the self--other encounter possible in the first place. For the
same reason, the key message of democratic peace theory --- that all
states should become democracies in order to minimize or eliminate the
possibility of wars --- is not only practically impossible, but also
ethically undesirable. It is impossible to verify because there is no
democracy that is immune to corruptibility (Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in
addition to that, it can be seen as undesirable since the notion that
all states must conform to the same universal ideal cancels out their
freedom to act, to take moral responsibility and so on.

The undesirability of a system that eradicates violence, borders and
discrimination is further underlined by Waltz (1979: 111--114) in his
discussion of the 'virtues of anarchy'. Therein, he attacks the idea of
transforming the international system into a world government. Not only
would such a transformation 'be an invitation to prepare for world civil
war' (Waltz, 1979: 112), but it would take away the constitutive
violence at the heart of inter-state relations in the structure of
anarchy. The constant possibility of war in the international system
means that states will always be wary of provoking others in the search
for security. As he puts it: The constant possibility that force will be
used limits manipulations, moderates demands, and serves as an incentive
for the settlement of disputes. One who knows that pressing too hard may
lead to war has strong reason to consider whether possible gains are
worth the risks entailed.... The possibility that conflicts among
nations may lead to long and costly wars has ... sobering effects.
(Waltz, 1979: 113--114)

In this way, the conditions of peace in the international system can be
said to rest on the constant possibility of war. In making this point,
Waltz argues against moral universalism. Hence, unwittingly or
otherwise, he also opens up space for ethical negotiation by recognizing
the finitude of the political subject, who is free to interact with
others only on the condition that self and other do not have to conform
to the 'same' universal ideal. The subject is thus able to take moral
responsibility and ponder on how to make ethical decisions, which,
without difference and alterity, would turn into a strictly formal
procedure based on the 'mechanical application of rules' (Zehfuss, 2009:
146).

Responsibility and ethical decisions are, thus, made possible precisely
by the impossibility of predetermining what is the 'right' decision in
any given context. As Derrida argues, irrespective of how thorough the
decision-making procedure is, and regardless of how much knowledge is
acquired before taking a decision: the instant of the decision, if there
is to be a decision, must be heterogeneous to this accumulation of
knowledge. Otherwise, there is no responsibility. In this sense only
must the person taking the decision not know everything. Even if one
knows everything, the decision, if there is one, must advance toward a
future that is not known, that cannot be anticipated. (Derrida, 2002b:
231)

The impossibility of anchoring the decision in rational calculation is,
in this sense, what creates the chance for any decisions to be taken at
all. The instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a fully present
moment in which the subject calculates the future consequences of the
decision, but to a future that is incalculable (see Derrida, 2002a). It
is precisely this incalculability, and the uncertainty of the future,
that Waltz's conception of anarchy positively affirms. Rather than
making the instant of the decision obsolete by transforming the decision
into a mere application of rules, anarchy makes the ethical decision
'possible'.

Even if Waltz repeatedly claims that the desire to survive is a purely
pragmatic assumption made strictly for the purpose of constructing an
explanatory theory, it is not neutral or innocent. First and foremost,
Waltzian neorealism expresses an ethics due to the way it affirms
states' desire to survive by stipulating the necessary conditions of
their survival. More precisely, it affirms the uncertainty of
international life by refusing to reduce the play of relations between
states to a calculable formula or a regulative ideal, and that rather
embraces chance and contingency as central features of the anarchic
system --- features that make states simultaneously free and insecure.16
In this light, the primary significance of Waltz's theory is not as an
explanatory theory, but as a theory that affirms the time of
international life, defined by the uncertainty of the future and the
logic of the erasable mortal trace.17 It is this notion of the future
that makes it possible for states, as finite political subjects, not
only to survive, but also to try to take moral responsibility and make
ethical decisions.

Why universal ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable

What are the implications of my reading of Waltzian neorealism as an
ethics? First of all, it contributes to a new understanding of the
difficulties inherent in [[any attempt to]{.mark} **theorize** what it
might **mean** to [replace the structure]{.mark} of **anarchy** [with
a]{.mark}n international or world political [**order** that is]{.mark}
supposedly [**'more'** ethical]{.mark}. If ethics is inextricably
**interlinked** with the **structural** conditions of **survival**, then
[any **attempt** to challenge]{.mark} neo**realism** from an
**'ethical'** perspective [**must** do so by **replacing** one structure
of **survival** with **another**]{.mark}, and there can be **[no
guarantees]{.mark}** that [the **new structure** will be **less
violent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While this does not in any way prevent
such attempts from being made, it does highlight the risky nature of
trying to resolve problems of war and violence in international politics
on ethical terms. For example, the idea of creating a new form of
political community that transcends [the [exclusionary]{.mark} borders
of [states may **seem** naturally **desirable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Linklater, 1982). Yet, [regardless of how **sophisticated**
theories become in terms of **articulating**]{.underline} the content
and meaning of such a community, [there can be **[no
guarantees]{.mark}** that [attempts to **actualize**]{.mark} it will
