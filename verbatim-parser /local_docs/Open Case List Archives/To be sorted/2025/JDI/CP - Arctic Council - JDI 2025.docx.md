[The Arctic is a unique geographical region]{.underline} and Arctic
nations have long held that its peace and cooperation should not be
affected by conflicts in other regions of the world. However, the
Russia-Ukraine conflict has broken the normative concept of Arctic
exceptionalism and will likely reconfigure the region's geopolitical
architecture. At the same time, however, we must see that the Arctic
Council, in its 26 years of existence, has become a core mechanism in
Arctic governance. Hence, disintegration doesn't come easy. Nonetheless,
there might be some adjustments in its future development.

The Arctic Council has not yet disbanded. The seven countries merely
suspended their participation with Russia as the current chair and
changed the St Petersburg meeting to be online. They didn't declare they
were disbanding. Though Moscow took a rather tough attitude toward the
Arctic's subregional cooperation mechanisms, it has maintained a
flexible stand regarding the upheaval in the council. All this indicates
that, both sides have a tacit understanding that [the current framework
should be maintained.]{.underline}

Back in 2014, Iceland was the rotating chair of the council during the
Crimea crisis, and most activities went on as usual in Reykjavik.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov even attended the council's
ministerial meeting that year, which actually offered an occasion for
both sides to manage differences. Currently, by contrast, Russia chairs
the council, so it would involve too much political symbolism for the
other seven Arctic nations and observer states to send their envoys to
attend meetings in Russia. The situation has not only deprived the
council of its role as the main body for Arctic dialogue but has become
another indicator of the Russia-West rupture.

Moreover, [the Arctic Council can't afford to disband]{.underline}. On
one hand are obstacles that can hardly be circumvented. The Ottawa
Declaration, which inaugurated the council, defines Russia as one of
eight members and stipulates that decisions are to be made by the
consensus of all states. Hence the other seven members will face an
obstacle by kicking Russia out. On the other hand is the perennial
governance conundrum. [The Arctic Ocean is a semi-closed basin, meaning
that any environmental or economic issue of any littoral state will
likely cause repercussions in the region]{.underline}. [[As the Arctic
warms]{.mark} ever [faster]{.mark}, the challenges of [climate change,
fishery management and environmental protection must be dealt with in a
coordinated way]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The council has]{.underline} in
past years [contributed to search and rescue, emergency prevention and
scientific research]{.underline}.

Under the current circumstances, it's not difficult for the seven Arctic
states to boycott talks with Russia, but it's difficult to configure a
new framework governance. Recently, the [U.S.]{.underline} coordinator
for the Arctic region, James Dehart, said, "[Arctic cooperation and
study must continue]{.underline}. ... We will [use this pause to figure
out how we can proceed]{.underline}." Such [cooperation might involve
engagement on technical issues]{.underline}. Russian officials will
probably be excluded from the upcoming online meetings, and change may
not occur until Norway takes over the chairmanship in 2023.

Regarding the [future development of the council]{.underline}, it [will
likely be]{.underline} a [U.S.-led]{.underline} regional governance
concept. What effects that will have on Russia and the council's
observers is worthy of close attention.

#### The counterplan [re-engages]{.underline} with the Arctic Council. That [solves the case]{.underline} by [revitalizing]{.underline} research and resource extraction.

2\. [[**Rejoin** the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}, [or ensure]{.mark}
**continued [support]{.mark}** [for its most **pressing**]{.mark}
**[initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Arctic Council has proven to
be the foremost player in international climate policy in the region,
and it was **specifically designed** to function in spite of the
**security** **differences** of its member states]{.underline}. The
United States and its allies have far more to lose by boycotting the
organization than they stand to gain.
**[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[should resume]{.mark}
participation]{.underline} [in the **Arctic Council** [as **soon** as
**possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}; if this is infeasible during Russia's
chairmanship of the council, the United States should continue its
support for the organization's six expert working groups, or seek to
duplicate their activities with regional partners or through other
forums. Norway will take over as chair of the council in 2023.

[The Arctic Council was]{.underline} responsible for several activities
of key import to US Arctic interests. First, the organization was [a
[**principal organizer** of **scientific collaboration**]{.mark} that
included]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [most of which has
**ground to a halt.**]{.underline} [Second, the Arctic Council created a
working group to study radiological sites in the Arctic, create
procedures to recover hazardous materials, and **craft [contingency
plans]{.mark}** [in case of **nuclear**
**contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The council was set to convene
this summer to discuss nuclear waste disposal, but the meeting has been
canceled. [Third,]{.underline} [the **organization** was largely
**responsible** for **[monitoring environmental]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[**conditions**]{.mark} [and **pollution**]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and experts fear that without adequate oversight,
Russia will be free to conduct harmful activities such as gas-flaring.

Analysts have proposed that the Arctic Council member states other than
Russia duplicate the most important organizational projects among
themselves, without Russian involvement. In fact, the United States has
successfully engaged allies to pursue environmental goals outside of the
forum in the past. Moreover, other organizations, such as the
International Arctic Science Committee, have continued their operations
without Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and could provide an
alternative for regional engagement.

However, although this approach would yield more progress than
suspending Arctic cooperation entirely, Russian involvement in Arctic
climate collaboration is critical. The nation owns more than half of the
Arctic coastline, contains the vast majority of the area's radiological
contamination, and samples and data from Russia are indispensable for
climate change research. Therefore, the United States should seek to
resume its participation in the Arctic Council in 2023 at the latest;
Washington should also address the environmental concerns that are
normally managed by the council's working groups with other Arctic
states until that point. US policymakers could also work through the
Northern Forum, a Russia-based international organization that
coordinates efforts among subnational Arctic governments; however, there
is no full substitute for national-level collaboration on larger
environmental priorities.

[In the **future**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot
**allow** its **relationship** with the **Arctic**]{.mark}
**[Council]{.mark}** [to become a **victim** of **security
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One of the principal strengths of
the Arctic Council is its **explicit commitment** to avoid **security
issues**]{.underline}. Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo upended this
norm by raising security concerns in the forum in 2019, and the United
States and its Western partners boycotted the organization in response
to another security situation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[If the
**United** States continues to link its **security concerns** with its
**Arctic Council activities**, the **organization's ability**]{.mark} to
**safeguard** the Arctic **environment** [could be **critically
eroded.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The net benefit is [Arctic Council Credibility]{.underline}. Arctic Council influence is [waning now]{.underline}, but [recommitting]{.underline} to it [builds]{.underline} a [bulwark]{.underline} that [prevents]{.underline} Arctic war from spiraling out of control.

4\. Diplomatic efforts and international governance

Due to the soft power strategy, [**[Arctic governance]{.mark}** has
[created **the Arctic Council as a**]{.mark} [**model** of
**inclusiveness**]{.mark} and **high-level intergovernmental
forum**]{.underline}, [where science diplomacy has played a pivotal role
in [**promoting** **cooperation**, **coordination**]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} **[interaction]{.mark}** among **circumpolar states** on
issues of **common concern**]{.underline}, including those relating to
sustainable development and environmental protection. The council brings
together the eight Arctic member states, organizations representing the
region's native peoples, and several observer states and organizations,
including China. \[24\] The Arctic Council was officially established in
1996 under the terms of the Ottawa Declaration, whose signatories were
Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the U.S.,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden. It cannot deal with
military and sovereignty issues (which are excluded from its field of
competence) to concentrate discussions on subjects that can more easily
be the subject of consensus such as scientific cooperation,
environmental protection, well-being and economic development of
indigenous populations, safety of navigation, etc. [Much of the Arctic
Council's work focuses on scientific and technical topics that are
studied in thematic working groups.]{.underline} \[25\]

Outside the Arctic Council, there are a multitude of official
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, whose purpose is to
manage various issues in the Arctic; The Arctic Circle is an
organization established by Iceland on 15 April 2013. Its mission is to
facilitate dialogue between political leaders, business leaders,
environmental experts, scientists, indigenous representatives and other
international stakeholders on issues related to the Arctic. The four
Arctic states located in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
and Iceland, which has strong historical ties to Europe, are known as
the "Nordic countries". Much of the cooperation between these states
relates to issues they have in common with Western Russia, the Baltic
and Barents Sea regions and the greater Nordic region, including
international waters. In addition to those organizations, six other
organizations representing Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have
permanent participant status. \[26\]

There are also non-Arctic countries that have been granted observer
status, such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, France, Spain,
Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland.
This is in addition to many other international organizations such as
the UN through some of its programs related to environment and
development. European and Asian countries have shown their interests and
responsibilities in a strategy document on the Arctic. The EU adopted an
integrated policy on the Arctic zone in 2016 and is currently
considering updating these guidelines. Asian states' ongoing research
agendas and scientific cooperation have made their engagement crucial
for the development of Arctic knowledge. Japan and South Korea launched
the construction of an icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be
deployed in 2026. \[27\]

There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. However, the U.S. can expect
Russia to remain open to peaceful discussions. Even at the height of the
Cold War, the Soviet Union cooperated with the West on Arctic issues,
including initiatives such as the 1973 Convention on the Conservation of
Polar Bears \[28\] and the 1987 Murmansk Initiative toward regional
cooperation, recognizing the special responsibilities and special
interests of the States of the Arctic Region in relation to the
protection of the fauna and flora of the Arctic Region and recognizing
that the polar bear is a significant resource of the Arctic Region that
requires additional protection.

[To manage the escalating tensions in the Arctic, states must strike a
balance between]{.underline} [cooperation and strategic rivalry through
**bilateral** and **international diplomacy**.]{.underline} Important
Arctic nations like the U.S. and Russia hold bilateral discussions to
lower the likelihood of armed conflict, frequently concentrating on
keeping lines of communication open about security-related issues.
[Despite the modest progress made in these discussions, they are
nonetheless [crucial for defusing]{.mark} any [confrontations]{.mark}
[considering the **Arctic's** **growing
militarization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Security matters are
noticeably]{.underline} [missing from **multilateral institutions** like
the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}, which offers all Arctic nations a
diplomatic forum to debate environmental, economic, and indigenous
issues.

[Despite the current]{.underline} high [tensions]{.underline} and given
the potential for mutual destruction, [[Russia and NATO]{.mark} [share
an interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [maintaining peace]{.mark} in the
**Arctic region** in]{.underline} [addition to **diplomatic frameworks**
that provide legal channels for settling competing]{.underline} [claims
to **seabed resources**]{.underline}, such as the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \[29\] NATO's attempts to
coordinate security plans among its Arctic member states, strengthening
regional stability, are another example of multilateral diplomacy in
action. Although these diplomatic efforts aid in the management of
tensions, they frequently fail to address the more serious security
threats brought on by military buildups and geopolitical rivalry in the
Arctic. \[30\]

Conclusion

With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military supremacy
driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed geopolitical
region. [[Global powers like **China**]{.mark}, [the **U.S.,** and
**Russia** are **vying** for]{.mark} **[control of the region]{.mark}**
because of the melting ice]{.underline}, [which has made it more
**accessible** for **economic exploitation**. [Territorial claims
overlap when states **bolster** their **military presence**]{.mark},
[raising the possibility of **error or conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The Arctic [runs the risk]{.mark} of [**turning** into a **hot spot**
for **future hostilities**]{.mark} in the **absence** of **defined
methods** to handle these tensions.]{.underline}

[[There is an urgent need for more]{.mark} **international
[collaboration]{.mark}** [to stop this **escalation**.]{.mark} Although
the UNCLOS]{.underline} [and [the **Arctic Council**]{.mark} [have
**facilitated communication**]{.mark}]{.underline}, they are
ill-equipped to handle the region's growing security concerns.
[Redoubled efforts should]{.underline} concentrate on broadening
diplomatic channels to cover security and military matters, [setting up
a platform for Arctic countries to discuss weapons control and
**developing guidelines** for **military behavior**]{.underline}. [The
moment has come for Arctic]{.underline} [countries to engage in
**formalized diplomatic discussion** that covers military and security
matters]{.underline}. [Whether through]{.underline} a distinct treaty or
[[the Arctic Council]{.mark}, a new global]{.underline} security
framework [might [offer a forum for]{.mark} [**controlling** the
**military buildup**]{.mark}]{.underline}, negotiating arms control
measures, [and defining explicit rules of engagement to avoid
unintentional conflicts.]{.underline} In addition to lowering the
likelihood of violence, this would establish a crisis management system
in the Arctic. [[International organizations must also]{.mark}
**[mediate conflicts]{.mark}** and make sure that]{.underline}
[**competition** i]{.underline}n the Arctic [doesn't]{.underline}
[jeopardize]{.underline} [indigenous rights or the **sustainability** of
the **environment**.]{.underline} In [the face of mounting global
pressure, the **Arctic** can only continue to be a **region of
harmony**, **collaboration**, and **shared wealth** via **concerted
effort**.]{.underline}

One minute before midnight of the day of Barack Obama's inauguration,
the Bush Administration issued a National Security Presidential
Directive (NSPD 66), which outlined a [[United States Arctic Region
Policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. NSPD 66 stated that the United States
should develop "greater capabilities and capacity" in the Arctic in
order to protect US borders and that military vessel and aircraft
mobility and transport throughout the Arctic should be preserved.
Furthermore, it urged the Senate to ratify UNCLOS to ensure military
transportation and sovereignty over resource-rich areas\[197\]. [This
directive was important because it [**elevated** the]{.mark} posture of
the [Arctic within American **foreign policy**]{.mark}

when the United States assumes the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in

**imperative** that **Washington shows leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}
in moving towards an ANWFZ\[199\].

apprehension about nuclear weapons and have been supportive of the
global abolition movement generally. They have signed on to all relevant
international protocols that have sought to reduce international

\"How and Why the Arctic Council Survived Russia's Invasion of
Ukraine\", Jordan Russia Center
https://jordanrussiacenter.org/blog/how-and-why-the-arctic-council-survived-russias-invasion-of-ukraine

On 3 March 2022, the seven Western Arctic states issued a joint
statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and temporarily paused
their activities within the Council. This disruption also found place in
other fora like the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, from which Russia
withdrew its participation, and the Council of the Baltic Sea States,
from which Russia was suspended. The discussions within the Arctic
Council at the political level were largely confidential, and did not
always include permanent participants in decision-making processes.

In May 2022, Norway confirmed that it would proceed with preparations
for its upcoming chairship period despite the ongoing pause. The
following June, the "Arctic seven"---the western AC member
states---issued a statement signaling partial resumption of AC work
without Russian involvement. This action attracted media attention,
adding traction to debates about the Council's prospects, which seemed
bleak at the time. The Arctic Circle Assembly in October 2022 was,
however, a turning point. Among those closely involved with the Arctic
Council, the approach had been to avoid public discussions about its
survival to prevent further speculation as to the body's future. But
after the Arctic Circle Assembly, leaders deemed it necessary to assert
the Council's relevance and demonstrate the commitment of all Arctic
states to its continued survival.

In November 2022, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov invited the
Arctic states to a ministerial meeting to take place in May 2023. Norway
accepted the invitation, signaling its desire for a smooth chairship
transition and the continued existence of the Arctic Council. The
transition of chairship from Russia and Norway was completed on 11 May
2023, despite challenges and the lack of in-person participation.

During the transition, Norway outlined its priorities, focusing on
oceans, climate and environment, sustainable development, and the
well-being of northern communities. Although Russia expressed
conditioned skepticism to the upcoming Norwegian chairship period,
particularly due to the potential influence of NATO in the Arctic
Council---since, indeed, all AC member states except Russia were now
NATO members---it did not push for alternative multilateral platforms.

After the transition, the body approved new guidelines for resuming
scientific work within the Council's Working Groups. The collective
efforts of the Arctic states, under Norwegian chairship, have been
crucial in preserving the Council's role during this challenging period.
Despite these gains, however, the future of the Arctic Council remains
uncertain.

Why did the Arctic Council survive?

We define "survival" as the Arctic Council's ability to continue
functioning, albeit to a limited extent, with all participating member
states. All member states have been kept engaged in ongoing activities
to varying degrees, and all member states, including Russia, have
expressed a desire to maintain cooperation. This fact, however, does not
guarantee the Council's future stability, much less immunity to external
or internal challenges.

Legal framework

The legal framework of the Arctic Council is rooted in the 1996 Ottawa
Declaration and the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS),
which emphasize consensus-based decision-making among member states.
This framework deliberately avoids military security issues. The Council
lacks the authority to impose sanctions, allowing its working groups to
make clearer recommendations without the constraints of consensus-driven
decision-making. These working groups, some of which predate the Council
itself, have been instrumental in shaping international environmental
policies.

Hence, the Arctic Council is more of a decision-shaping body than a
decision-making one, providing a platform for non-state actors like
indigenous communities to engage in international governance. Norway's
chairship transition in 2023 was made possible through a combination of
established procedural documents and the strategic plan for 2021--2030.
This strategic reliance on existing frameworks enabled Norway to
navigate diplomatic challenges, ensuring the Council's survival during a
period of geopolitical instability. Yet procedural feasibility alone
does not fully explain the Council's survival.

Strategic framework

Over recent decades, global interest in the Arctic has surged, driven by
the region's strategic importance and the growing need for international
cooperation. The AC has played a central role in facilitating this
interest, even during times of high geopolitical tensions. All AC member
states agree that the Arctic Council is the main forum for multilateral
cooperation in the Arctic in the relevant strategic documents.

Moreover, the Arctic Council was created on the assumption that it would
be possible to cooperate with Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union. Indeed, the Council's founding agreement, the AEPS, was enabled
through the Murmansk initiatives articulated by Mikhail Gorbachev in
1987.

Foreign policy engagement

The Arctic Council has been a central arena for international
cooperation in the region for several reasons. First, by promoting
multilateral cooperation through the Council, Arctic states can counter
expansionist ambitions from non-Arctic states and prevent
conflict-driven narratives. The Council also serves as a barrier against
the establishment of competing regimes, reinforcing the legitimacy of
frameworks like the Law of the Sea Convention.

Furthermore, the Arctic Council's structure, which includes indigenous
peoples' organizations as permanent participants, adds legitimacy and
ensures diverse perspectives in decision-making. The Arctic Council\'s
role in knowledge generation and its established networks have
heightened global awareness of Arctic climate challenges, making its
survival crucial for continued environmental collaboration.

Finally, the Council\'s origins in the post-Cold War era and its role in
maintaining regional stability underscore its importance. The transition
of chairmanship from Russia to Norway, coupled with the resumption of
project-level work, illustrates the collective determination of the
Arctic states to ensure the Council\'s continued existence, with an
open-door policy for Russia's potential future re-engagement.

\"Russia seeks to restore situation within Arctic Council --- foreign
ministry\", https://tass.com/politics/1931215

NEW DELHI, March 20. /TASS/. Russia seeks to restore the situation
within the Arctic Council, which remains the only platform for
multilateral cooperation in the Far North, Director of the Russian
Foreign Ministry\'s Department of European Affairs Vladislav Maslennikov
said.

Moscow is committed to an equal and mutually beneficial dialogue in the
region, Maslennikov stressed. \"In fact, the Arctic Council remains the
only platform for multilateral cooperation in the Far North in the
current complex geopolitical conditions,\" he said in a video message to
the participants of the Northern Forum - India business and scientific
conference held in New Delhi.

The diplomat noted that the effective and non-politicized work of the
Arctic Council \"is crucial to reach joint solutions in areas like
sustainable social and economic development of the Arctic, protection of
cultural heritage and rights of indigenous peoples, climate change
mitigation and preservation of the Arctic fragile environment.\"

\"Together with Norway\'s presidency and the Arctic Council Secretariat,
we are striving to reestablish the situation within the organization
after its full-fledged activity was frozen at the initiative of Western
countries,\" Maslennikov pointed out.

The work of the Arctic Council was suspended on March 3, 2022, but
participants resumed written communication in the fall of 2023. In
February 2024, the Arctic Council\'s secretariat said it would resume
working group meetings on environmental and safety issues in a virtual
format, with Russia at the table. The first meetings were held in the
spring and summer of 2024.

The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental organization of the Arctic
nations - Denmark (together with Greenland and the Faroe Islands),
Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.

#### Even if the relationship is dead -- the CP solves enough coop and gets Russia to the table

**Gricius 22 - graduate fellow with the North American and Arctic
Defense Security Network, and Ph.D. candidate in political science,
Colorado State University** (Gabriella Gricius, 04-2022, \"Why freezing
the Arctic Council is bad news for global security\", SOURCE,
https://source.colostate.edu/why-freezing-the-arctic-council-is-bad-news-for-global-security/)

[For the past quarter-century, the Arctic has been a unique zone of
cooperation among the eight countries of the high north: Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.
Even when relations between Moscow and the West soured, the Arctic
Council's work was a reminder that multilateral partnerships could
thrive despite global discord.]{.underline}

The point of the Arctic Council is to foster collaboration in areas such
as scientific research, search and rescue operations and the challenges
posed by climate change. Under its auspices, friends and adversaries
alike -- as well as nonstate actors, such as Indigenous groups -- can
sit down, talk and find common ground. In early 2022, lawmakers from
Norway nominated the council for the Nobel Peace Prize for its
collaborative spirit.

[That collaboration ended shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022. One week after the start of the war, seven of the eight
Arctic Council members announced that they would "pause" their work with
the organization. Russia, which holds the council's presidency through
2023, was left ostracized.]{.underline}

The freeze of the Arctic Council is a loss on many fronts. As a scholar
of Arctic security, I [see cooperation in the region as essential to
global security, and I believe an expanded set of institutions is needed
to reflect new global realities as the Arctic warms.]{.underline}

Security and cooperation in the Arctic

The eight Arctic countries formed the Arctic Council in 1996. While the
council explicitly steers clear of military issues, its members are
stewards of the Arctic region. Unsurprisingly, the organization has
grown in importance with global warming.

Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new shipping
routes and, likely, expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas and
other critical minerals -- changes that could spur conflict if not
handled carefully.

[Through the council, the Arctic states have made agreements related to
search and rescue operations, oil pollution and scientific
collaboration.]{.underline} The council has tracked environmental
changes in the region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment
reports. Even when relations between East and West were at their worst,
including in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula
from Ukraine, joint endeavors in the Arctic remained strong.

Pausing the work of the Arctic Council was an understandable response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [Yet in doing so, the other Arctic
countries lost a valuable line of communication with Moscow. In time, it
will be important to resume the council]{.underline} or establish a new
institution in its place.

[Indeed, working with Russia in the Arctic is even more important now
than it was before the invasion. From a global security perspective, it
is essential that the hot war in Europe be prevented from spilling over
into the Arct]{.underline}ic and one of the world's last wildernesses.

The case for engaging Russia

Consider, for example, that while tensions are at an all-time high in
Ukraine, it might be easy to mistake a flock of geese or a meteor shower
for a military attack. Having a way for errors like these to be quickly
remedied will be important in this new era of geopolitical competition.

[Preserving and enhancing cooperation in the Arctic will take bold
leadership]{.underline}. Some critics argue that institutionalizing
military dialogue with Russia in the Arctic is an improper response to
wanton aggression in Eastern Europe and could be seen as legitimizing
Russia's actions. These are valid concerns.

[However, giving up on cooperation would be a mistake. The whole world
will benefit if the high north can avoid the fate of militarization, a
costly arms race and the terrible specter of war.]{.underline}

[Ideally, engaging Russia within an expanded set of regional
institutions -- an invigorated Arctic Council]{.underline}, to be sure,
but also a new military forum -- would precipitate a cooperation spiral,
increasing cooperation that could help lessen tensions elsewhere. [Even
if collaboration were confined to the Arctic, this would boost global
security.]{.underline}

A new Arctic?

In the past, the Arctic states sought to maintain peace and stability in
their region by divorcing contentious military issues from areas where
common ground was easier to find. This has been the modus vivendi of the
Arctic Council since its founding.

[Going forward, it would be better to recognize that robust and ongoing
cooperation is needed on security issues, too. Trust between Russia and
the West might never return, but cooperation in the Arctic cannot be
allowed to disappear with it.]{.underline}

#### Arctic Council key to solve overfishing

**Uryupova 21 -- Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute**

4-27-**2021**, \"Why do we need a shared Pan-Arctic Fisheries Governance
Complex?,\" Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/need-shared-pan-arctic-fisheries-governance-complex/

By the end of 2020, nine of the ten countries-signatories ratified the
2018 Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. But is that reason to
celebrate? Not really... In the Arctic, **[[abundant fisheries provide
the primary source of food for the region]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
However, their productivity, as well as their impact on species
diversity and importance for industrial and traditional fisheries,
varies greatly. This specifies the fisheries governance framework in the
entire region. Unlike Antarctica, where the Commission for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) focuses on
the conservative and precautionary use of the fish stocks, the ice-free
Arctic area is covered by regional fisheries management organizations.
Commercial fishing in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas is not evenly
distributed, and it is very much locally concentrated ---- so far. But
**[[the ocean is a dynamic natural system that changes rapidly, and this
has been especially true in recent decades.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
high seas contain commercially important species, such as cod, crabs,
halibut, pollock, shrimps, capelin, squid, scallops, etc.. Some of the
species are defined as "circumpolar," while others are characterized by
wider distribution. But how do we manage fish stocks in the region in
response to environmental changes? And what is the nearest future of a
Pan-Arctic fisheries legal regime? Does the existing mechanism work fast
enough when it comes to current climate change issues? The Central
Arctic Ocean According to the **[[Arctic Council, nine of the ten
signatories have completed the ratification
process]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the 2018 Central Arctic Ocean
Fisheries **[[A]{.mark}greemen[t (CAOFA)
recently]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The agreement is expected to enter into
force 30 days after receipt of the final instrument of ratification (the
tenth signatory) and it will remain in effect for 16 years. There is an
option of an automatic extension of the agreement for additional
five-year periods if all the Parties agree1). **[[If any of the ten
Parties fails to provide the relevant instrument to the depository, the
agreement will not enter into force at all.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
prerequisite to the agreement was a declaration signed by Arctic coastal
states in 2015, **[[which prohibited commercial fishing by the Arctic
nations' vessels in the international waters of the Central Arctic
Ocean2]{.underline}]{.mark}**). However, the underpinnings of this
agreement were put forth several years prior: a joint resolution
directing the United States to initiate international discussions on
management of fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean was declared in 20073).
The resolution was signed into law in 2008, and the United States
established a catch quota of zero for US waters in the Chukchi and
Beaufort Seas until it obtained sufficient information to support the
establishment of an economically and environmentally sustainable
fishery4). The CAOFA is based on a similar idea, as there is a lack of
scientific information about fish stocks and ecosystem dynamics in the
region. **[[The current multilateral moratorium aims to prevent Arctic
Ocean fishing, setting aside some degree of sovereignty disputes while
scientific research exploration continues.]{.underline}]{.mark}**5) This
moratorium on commercial fishing applies to the central Arctic Ocean,
which currently remains ice-covered for most of the year. In other
words, the ice-free parts of the Arctic Ocean are open for fisheries and
research, as they were before. The CAOFA provides **[[great
opportunities for cooperative governance of the Arctic, including Arctic
and non-Arctic states]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It establishes a
precautionary framework for the regulation of fisheries in the high seas
of the central Arctic Ocean (CAO), including a temporary moratorium on
unregulated commercial fishing. The agreement's precautionary nature
seems to be an advantage in planning of fishing activities in adjacent
areas, as well as to prevent any negative impacts to commercially
significant fish species in the Central Arctic and adjacent seas.
Various factors may have a negative impact on ecosystems in the Central
Arctic Ocean in the future. If the distribution and productivity of fish
stocks in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) in the Arctic were altered
due to climate change, it would be logical to assume that the high
latitudes with ice-free ocean areas might be considered future fishing
grounds. If in the future the multilateral moratorium on the Arctic high
seas fisheries could not be extended for a variety of reasons, we might
expect increased competition for marine living resources of the
Arctic6). The Role of Regional Fisheries Governance It is worth
mentioning that northern nations possess 200 nautical miles of offshore
EEZ, or exclusive sea zones prescribed by the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), over which these countries have special
rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. The
current allocation of catches in the region is therefore dominated by
the Arctic states -- Norway, Canada, Russia, Iceland, and the USA.
Greenland and the Faroe Islands, autonomous self-governing entities
within the Kingdom of Denmark, are considered special cases and are
therefore not included under the European Union's Common Fisheries
Policy. Their special status is a direct result of their histories, as
marine living resources are integral to traditional and Indigenous
cultures there. According to the assessment on Arctic biodiversity, a
total of 633 fish species are found in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent
seas.7) Among them, 80 (12.6 percent) are freshwater species, 44 (6.9
percent) inhabit both marine and fresh waters, and 16 species (2.5
percent) are mainly restricted to Arctic waters. Less than 10 percent of
the total fish biodiversity is used for commercial purposes in the
Arctic Ocean, sub-Arctic and boreal areas.8) **[[Commercial fishing
activity does occur in the high seas areas of the North Atlantic and
North Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, large-scale
commercial fisheries activities are taking place in the Barents and the
Bering Seas, but other fisheries in the Arctic Ocean are essentially
limited to small-scale subsistence fisheries in Arctic coastal states'
maritime zones. The regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs),
as well as sub-regional and bilateral instruments, play an active role
in preventing unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas part of
the Arctic Ocean. Some of them manage all the fish stocks found in a
specific area, while others focus on particular highly-migratory
species. The organizations are open both to countries in the region and
countries with interests in the fisheries concerned. For instance, the
North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) has a mandate over the
North-East Atlantic sector, and the North Pacific Fisheries Commission
(NPFC) has a mandate over the North Pacific area. Among others are
organizations with quite limited competence in the Arctic, including the
North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) and the
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). How might potential
disagreement on fisheries management in the Arctic be used in effective
negotiation on a local level? For example, there is a controversial
issue between Iceland and the European Union. Iceland provides EU member
states with access to its EEZ, while the EU requires that Iceland end
the whaling activities.9) There is still room for improvement in the
effectiveness of the legal framework governing Arctic waters, and every
particular case is essential to ensure future sustainable fisheries. In
general, fisheries management in the different parts of the Arctic Ocean
is a mixture of coastal state regulation and a multilateral approach. In
this framework, bilateral agreements between countries help to regulate
and manage access to fish stocks within adjacent EEZ. For example, the
Joint Commission established by the bilateral framework Agreement
between Russia and Norway works relatively effective for both
states.10). Recently, the close relations between the United Kingdom and
Norway have been recalled too,11) as well as with the Faroe Islands.
However, a post-Brexit agreement between the EU and the UK has taken a
long time to be finalised for UK catches in Arctic waters. These small
points matter when it comes to the work of the entire mechanism,
especially in a rapidly changing Arctic region. Present and Future of
Arctic Fisheries Management Some specifics may be identified regarding
the especially high vulnerability of the Arctic to the general impacts
of a rapidly changing environment. Climate change could force the
migration of boreal species towards the northern seas, which would
result in a complete shift in ecosystem composition and undermine
existing food webs. This scenario, however, does not diminish the role
of intensified competition between fisheries companies that may cause
stress for the environment. The absence of a shared legal regime that
may respond to climate changes in a fast and effective way hampers
international cooperation on environmental security and impacts regional
ecosystems in the Arctic. Climate change will most likely lead to new
fisheries conflicts, and create more challenges for existing fisheries
management institutions. Moreover, the speed of climatic disruption adds
a new level of complexity and challenge to the current legal systems as
soon as these systems were not designed to address. To increase dynamism
in the law and the flexibility of decision making, the Arctic needs an
updated shared legal regime that shows adaptive resource management --
for example, through the complex of the existing agreements used as an
universal international legally binding instrument. **[[The current
governance frameworks response to climate change from multiple
organizations leaving less efficient adaptatio]{.underline}]{.mark}**n.
Uncertainties regarding climate change impacts may also lead to wrong or
superfluous decisions. Counterproductive responses may be easily
achieved as a result of a wrong choice by a level of government that is
best suited to an adaptive reaction. One can argue that there is a
variety of habitats and ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean, and it requires
an ecosystem-based management approach only. Notably, this approach has
already been adopted by the Arctic Council Ministers in 2004 as a
principle for work in the region.12) However, when it comes to the
nature of marine living resources, it should be taken into account that
the geographic boundaries can be easily crossed by migratory species,
especially in a rapidly changing Arctic ocean. What are the consequences
of these migrations? With the rising temperatures, species that inhabit
the climatic zone south of the Arctic will likely continue to migrate
northward and replace local cold-water species. Scientists predict the
natural marine ecosystems will undergo a dramatic transformation that
may lead to a significant change in the distributions of fish stocks in
the Arctic high seas. In the Barents Sea, warm-water fish species from
the Atlantic and central Barents Sea have already pushed cold-water fish
species out of the shelf area. Cod, a major commercial species, as well
as long rough dab and beaked redfish (which can be considered generalist
fish species) travel towards the north in search of suitable
habitats.13) Also, recent observations have shown that the spawning
sites of Northeast Arctic cod will be shifted further north eastwards
over the next 50 years.14) In high latitudes, Atlantic mackerel has been
found west of Svalbard,15) and Atlantic cod, capelin, Greenland halibut,
haddock, redfish -- as far north as the shelf break north of
Svalbard.16) In the Pacific sector, pink salmon is inhabiting the
warming northern Bering Sea: due to its short, two-year life cycle, the
species is well known to respond rapidly to ecosystem change.17) These
global processes lead to dramatic changes not only in expanded nursery
areas but also in growing availability of sufficient food for fish in
the northern waters. **[[The increased accessibility of the Arctic, with
new fishing opportunities, is both enabling and propelling Arctic states
to develop national regulation for area]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
characterized by shrinking ice in order to discharge their obligations
under international law. In 2009, the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council (NPFMC) approved a comprehensive Arctic fishery management plan
that lead to commercial fishery development in the U.S. Arctic Exclusive
Economic Zone (off Alaska north of the Bering Strait).18) The High Seas
are a particular international component of the marine environment of
the Arctic Ocean. Resources and ecosystems extend across political
boundaries, highlighting the need for governance and planning to be
developed and coordinated at the higher than the national level. And the
Arctic is warming faster than any other area on Earth, so this complex
region requires a special legal regime. In the Arctic, highly migratory
fish stocks and boreal invaders are subject to the different governance
regimes of the high seas and the EEZ. However, the international legal
framework on fisheries in the High Seas does not allow absolute
open-access schemes, so ecological alterations may potentially
destabilize existing management regimes. Changes to fishery stock
compositions and distributions can result in conflicts between Arctic
nations due to overlapping jurisdictional claims, unregulated fishing,
and a lack of multi-regional agreements. The current model of Arctic
fisheries management is not flexible enough to effectively address
future fishery challenges caused by climate change. The comprehensive
regime of law and order in the high seas is required to protect
vulnerable Indigenous peoples from the impacts of climate change.
Transnational negotiations over fisheries and quotas are obstacles that
hinder current regional fisheries governance in the Arctic. Often,
countries argue over "holes" located between the exclusive economic
zones. Such a high seas pocket between Norway and Russia in the Barents
Sea was targeted for cod by vessels from different states throughout
most of the 1990s. Also, this scheme does not look easy for non-Arctic
states: recently the UK has been blocked from catches in the Arctic
waters due to delays in a post-Brexit agreement to be signed. A short
while ago, an intergovernmental dispute emerged in relation to fish
stocks in the Northeast Atlantic: a conflict between Iceland, Norway,
the EU, and Denmark (representing the Faroe Islands and Greenland) that
unfolded after the abrupt and rapid change in distribution of the
northeast Atlantic mackerel stock after 2007.19) Originally, Norway, the
EU and Faroe Islands shared the mackerel quotas, but shifts in migratory
behaviour of the fish resulted in Iceland being involved in fishing
activities in its EEZ. After many rounds of negotiations between Iceland
and Norway and the EU, the dispute remains unresolved. As a result of
the mackerel dispute, sanctions have been implemented against Iceland,
but the country continues to set its own quotas each fishing year. The
dispute demonstrates the limitations of high seas fisheries management
mechanisms, and the challenges involved in ensuring compliance. In other
words, a changing climate has been challenging the effectiveness of
existing international resource management structures in Arctic waters.
The matter of quota allocation and access to the exclusive economic
zones tend to be a highly controversial aspect of fisheries management
anytime, thus this problem might be solved by a broader and more
powerful set of compliance mechanisms. Nowadays, the basis for a legal
framework in the region are the UNCLOS of 1982 and the United Nations
Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) of 1995, they provide principles of
international cooperation in conservation and fisheries management but
do not formalize the way states use them. Talking about the Arctic
regions with local regimes, such as the Svalbard Fisheries Protection
Zone in the Barents Sea or a nearshore area around the Franz Josef Land
Archipelago, the exclusive fishing rights (full or limited) in the zones
are given to nations as compared to full exclusive economic zones. Those
countries manage to provide access to their waters to other interested
parties. However, if a fisheries conflict appears, the broader system of
laws may be very helpful. For instance, a discord on the use of the
Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone established by the Norwegian
Government in 1977 still needs to be resolved, as soon as it has been an
issue of international dispute ever since. Fisheries galore in the
Arctic requires the precautionary approach which is always a part of a
broader set of principles of responsible harvesting that includes
biodiversity protection, science-based decisions, and ecosystem
awareness. The changes occurring in the Arctic due to shrinking of sea
ice may create unfavourable conditions for species that are economic
resources at present. All kinds of human activities that were not
possible because of severe climate characteristics, may result in risk
of environmental degradation and consequently to decrease in fish
stocks. The absence of a single effective governance complex on
enforcing power that coordinates fishing in the Arctic region might also
lead to the situation that the international cooperation in the
fisheries sector is affected. The exploration and exploitation of living
resources in the marine Arctic will require the adoption of new
regulatory measures in order to effectively mitigate and adapt to
climate change. Turning Weakness into Strengths The existing framework
for fisheries management, with global, regional and national components
is applicable to the Arctic. Despite a large number of bodies where
cooperation in research and management occurs, a comprehensive,
Arctic-specific legal regime is still lacking. The Arctic Council
remains the only organization working at the global Arctic level, with a
focus on regional monitoring and conservation management. Nevertheless,
there are no legally binding obligations, structural funding, or a
permanent and independent secretariat at the Arctic Council.20) The
Arctic is warming faster than any other region on Earth, so it requires
a solution-focused approach. **[[It may require preparation of
additional measures applicable to the CAO and potentially to other parts
of the Arctic Ocean in order to provide options for more stringent
ecological/fisheries regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a regional
basis by coastal and other interested states. In general, the CAOFA only
aims to prevent rather than resolve the issues, so there is a long way
to go to build a solid governance complex in the entire Arctic.
Alternatively, it would be possible to fold the Arctic Ocean governance
complex, including the CAOFA, into more comprehensive arrangements
designed to use marine living resources sustainably. Admittedly,
environmental security and shared fisheries interests should prevail on
geopolitical agreements and conflicts in the Arctic region. The
reinforcement of the existing system is possible through better
cooperation and scientific coordination in the Arctic, effective
inter-organizational networking, and quick response to the field.

#### Goes Nuclear but Arctic Council is able to solve and prevent future fishing and resource conflicts

**Evans and Østhagen 21 -- Fellows at Arctic Institute**

Jen Evans, Andreas ØSthagen, 6-3-2021, \"Fisheries Disputes: The Real
Potential for Arctic Conflict,\" Arctic Institute - Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/fisheries-disputes-real-potential-arctic-conflict/

Much recent discussion has focused on the contemporary militarization of
Arctic and subarctic regions. Journalism and scholarship alike question
if military conflict might occur, how peace can be maintained, and what
war would look like in the Arctic. To provide insight on such queries,
The Arctic Institute's 2021 Conflict Series provides analysis on past
Arctic militarization and military activities---seeking both historic
context and lessons learned for modern Arctic politics. Conflict is a
natural part of society. It describes a situation where two or more
actors hold incompatible goals. Despite common usage, the term does not
entail outright hostility or war. As described by the SAGE Handbook of
Conflict Resolution: "conflict is normal, ubiquitous, and unavoidable."
As sea ice diminishes in the Arctic, writings about conflict in the
region have directed focus to accessing and potentially claiming
undiscovered offshore oil and gas resources. However, oil and gas
resources in the North have not yet generated conflict or aggression.
Instead, small-scale disputes in the Arctic are being primarily driven
by another ocean-based commodity: marine living resources. In the
Arctic, **[[retreating sea ice and climate change are altering the
distribution of marine living resources, while demand for these
resources has risen.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This, in turn, is
challenging established management regimes for transboundary resources
and calling for new forms of cooperation. Consequently, over the last
**[[decade several disputes have emerged over Arctic fisheries, at times
even escalating into outright conflict.]{.mark} [This is not the same as
claiming that outright hostilities amongst Arctic states are
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Still, we should look at past and
current examples of marine resource disputes, in order to say something
about how the way forward might evolve. Here we will examine three cases
of conflict related to fisheries management impacted by global warming
in the Bering Sea, Barents Sea, and the North Atlantic in an effort to
tease out lessons, dynamics, and general relevance to the Arctic region.
We start with the Bering Sea/Strait domain, before turning to some
relevant examples in the North Atlantic. Thereafter, we assess what
lessons these examples hold for future resource conflicts in the Arctic.
The Bering Sea / Strait **[[The Bering Sea and Bering Strait have long
been an area of contention surrounding the harvesting and conservation
of marine living resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 1887 and 1889, the
U.S. -- citing sustainability concerns -- seized British-Canadian
vessels harvesting seals in international waters of the Bering Sea.1)
This dispute set the stage for larger discussions on sustainable
harvesting in the region, ultimately leading to the North Pacific
Sealing Convention of 1911 and setting the precedent for future
agreements.2) Today, the Bering Sea is home to one of the world's
largest fisheries3) and its stocks are growing rapidly as fish migrate
north due to rising ocean temperatures.4) The fishery has subsequently
become a theatre of renewed U.S.-Russia competition: In 2020, fishing
vessels were targeted by Russian military within the American exclusive
economic zone (EEZ). Some 90 warships and military aircraft were part of
the Russian effort to secure economic development in the North Pacific,
a region that is becoming increasingly lucrative as melting sea ice
makes way for resource extraction and trade routes.5) Meanwhile,
President Biden has signed executive orders regulating pollution
associated with maritime vessels and restricting trawling practices
across large portions of the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea.
The executive orders contrast with Russia's moves towards economic
development, suggesting renewed friction between economic priorities and
environmental sustainability in the North Pacific. The North Atlantic /
Barents Sea One particular issue in the **[[North Atlantic has been the
still unresolved division of mackerel quotas, as the stock has shifted
its geographic positioning]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On its own, mackerel
constitutes one of the most profitable fish stocks in the North
Atlantic. Since reaching an agreement on quotas in 1999, the Northeast
Atlantic mackerel stock has predominantly been divided between the EU,
Norway, and the Faroe Islands. In 2006, the mackerel shifted northwards,
in tandem with a rise in the sea temperature in the North Sea and North
Atlantic.6) From virtually no catches prior to the stock's arrival in
2006, Icelandic fishermen caught more than 100,000 tonnes in
2008--2009,7) constituting approximately 20--25 percent of the total
catch of mackerel in the Northeast Atlantic. To date, however, Iceland
remains outside of the total quota-setting scheme. Over time, the
**[[coastal states' combined increase in fishing pressure resulted in
ever-growing overfishing of the stock]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By 2019
the fish stock had lost its "sustainable" certification through the
Marine Stewardship Council.8) In late 2019, Icelandic officials stated
they would not back down on the issue, while the remaining states
criticized its unilateral quota setting for endangering the health of
the fish stock.9) Another relevant case just north of Iceland -- in the
Barents Sea -- concerns snow crab and the Svalbard continental shelf.
Snow crab was first recorded in the eastern Barents Sea in 1996. In
Canada and the United States, snow crab ranks among the most valuable
fisheries. Thus, expectations in Norway have been high concerning the
economic potential of this new species, with some anticipating that it
might even surpass cod, which is currently the most valuable fishery in
the Norwegian EEZ.10) Starting in 2015, however, Norway introduced a ban
on the catching of snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf, which
includes the shelf around Svalbard. In practice, the Norwegian
government permitted a limited number of licences to be issued to
Norwegian fishermen exclusively, through special requests.11) Both the
EU and Norway define the snow crab as belonging to the continental shelf
regime. Therefore, the broader legal ramifications of this dispute go
beyond the right to catch snow crab on the continental shelf around
Svalbard, with potential applications to sedentary resources such as oil
and gas and seabed minerals. Although there has thus far been no oil and
gas drilling on the continental shelf around Svalbard, the outcome of
the dispute over snow crab might set a precedent for future industrial
activity.12) Arctic (marine) Resource Conflicts As shown in the cases
here, **[[although the potential for conflict over fisheries -- access
to or distribution of -- is relatively high]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
states have generally preferred to keep these disputes and, at times,
outright conflict separate from other issues.13) The mackerel dispute
has not hampered quota negotiations on other fish stocks amongst the
Northeast Atlantic coastal states (although there have been issues
concerning herring), nor has it affected their regional and bilateral
foreign relations. In the EU-Norway case, **[[politicians and diplomats
actively worked to keep the issue separate from larger Arctic governance
questions,]{.underline}]{.mark}** preferring to treat it as a fisheries
concern rather than linking it to the EU's continuous quest for a role
in the Arctic.14) Similarly, the U.S. Coast Guard refrained from
engaging Russian military in the Bering Sea -- even as American fishing
vessels were threatened -- citing Russia's right to conduct military
operations in the EEZ.15) Despite this relative compartmentalization,
two trends suggest that relations and issues concerning fisheries are
unlikely to become less sensitive in the near future. First, an
increasing number of fisheries -- American, Icelandic, Norwegian and
Russian -- are expected to venture further northwards in the Bering Sea,
Bering Strait, and the Barents Sea. This development will prompt the
coastal states to discuss changes to their management regimes and quota
distribution. Second, the Barents Sea and Bering Sea are playing an
increasing role in strategic posturing and military exercises, as NATO
members and Russia showcase their Arctic capabilities and aim to secure
rights to valuable trade routes. Furthermore, although fisheries
disputes are, to some extent, compartmentalized, they are also
increasingly entangled in domestic politics. The interests that states
hold in marine living resources---the Icelandic and Norwegian interests
in mackerel fisheries, Russian fisheries interests in the waters around
Svalbard, the interests of the EU and EU member states in snow crab
fisheries, and conflicting economic and sustainability interests in the
North Pacific---should not be underestimated. Although the monetary
value of these fisheries might not dwarf that of other Arctic industrial
or economic ventures, neither is it insignificant from a financial
viewpoint. Arctic states, driven by their fishers and fisheries, are not
likely to forgo access to fish stocks or yield quotas simply because the
fish stocks themselves have altered their distributional patterns. These
dimensions could be evidenced here by European politicians' statements
over the snow crab dispute; by the U.S. Coast Guard's lack of
forewarning to fishing vessels of planned Russian military operations in
U.S. waters; and by the arguments of Norwegian and Icelandic fisheries
organisations when disagreeing on mackerel quotas. Science to the
Rescue? The role of scientific advice in preventing future conflict
stands out as a particularly useful dimension for further examination.
The use of an assumedly neutral source of reliable information is
crucial for trust in the relevant regime, especially when dealing with
issues linked to climate change.16) If, however, there is too much
uncertainty surrounding reliable information, actors sometimes opt to
ignore, be selective of, or even hide relevant information.17) **[[One
solution that states in the Arctic and beyond have used to alleviate
such pressures is regional issue-specific multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, the Barents Sea
management regime -- through the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries
Commission -- has often been heralded as best practice with regards to
marine resource co-management mechanisms.18) Similarly, in the Bering
Sea, as the pollock stock collapsed in the early 1990s after a decade of
overfishing in the so-called "Donut Hole," a regime came into existence
to manage the stock.19) In 1994, an agreement on a temporary moratorium
on pollock was reached by the various national stakeholders, including
Japan, China, Poland, and South Korea, with stringent enforcement
measures.20) More recently, in 2018, the five Arctic states with direct
access to the Arctic Ocean -- together with China, Japan, Iceland, South
Korea and the EU -- agreed to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in
the high seas of the central Arctic Ocean.21) This was heralded as a
"proactive rather than reactive approach, showcasing the Arctic states'
commitment in dealing with climate change".22) There are similar bans on
commercial fishing within the EEZ in the Chukchi Sea (where the United
States imposes the ban unilaterally) and the Beaufort Sea (with the
United States and Canada imposing the ban bilaterally), which are in
place pending further research on the potential fish stocks migrating to
these areas. In other words, although conflict potential exists
concerning marine living resources in the Arctic, disputes over such
issues are not destined to escalate and/or become protracted. However,
**[[taking proactive measures or diffusing an ongoing dispute requires
both political engagement and concern over the long-term effects of a
protracted dispute]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Here, the mackerel dispute
can serve as a staunch lesson, as the stock lost its rather valuable
MSC-certification in 2019.23) The future is blue In the Arctic and
beyond, we can observe rapid changes in the maritime domain over the
last few decades. As these changes occur, attention is increasingly
directed towards the question of "who has what rights" at sea. Some
elements are central here: the state and use of scientific/external
advice when agreeing on quotas for marine living resources;24) the depth
of institutionalisation between the states in question;25) and the
(un)willingness by states to forgo access to fisheries seen in
conjunction with domestic interests and symbolism.26) It is no secret
that humanity is experiencing a widespread reduction in the total
biomass of marine resources, closely linked to human exploitative
activities.27) At the same time, stocks are changing their migratory
patterns because of changes in the geophysical marine environment.28) It
would be simple to conclude that the conflict potential between states
over how best to manage marine living resources in the Arctic is likely
to rise as a consequence of these factors. However, the Arctic states
have a history of developing co-management mechanisms to solve problems
with overfishing in northern waters. International cooperative
mechanisms have grown in all oceans bordering the Arctic, as well as in
the Arctic basin itself. They have grown out of a realization that
continued over-exploitation would lead to a lose-lose situation for all
states concerned. As the Arctic is particularly prone to environmental
changes, states will continue to navigate emerging issues with marine
resource management and distribution. Fisheries is indeed where the real
conflict potential in the Arctic lies, but that does not mean these
conflicts cannot be managed, or even resolved.

Last week, a CBS news story highlighting a 2006 study on the decline of
oceans\' health, was rediscovered and began trending on Facebook. With
the study back in the spotlight, I was delighted to join lead author Dr.

for improving the state of our oceans. While great strides have been
made in the eight years since the study was written, [**overall oceans\'

continuing to pose a very real threat to oceans and their resilience in
the face of new threats, including climate change and ocean
acidification.]{.underline} Overfishing: The root cause of oceans
decline During our talk, Dr. Worm and I discussed these issues and took
a deeper dive into **[[the root cause of oceans
decline---overfishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The world's population is
rising steadily and is estimated to reach about 8 billion people by 2024
and 9 billion by 2040. As the population increases, so too does the
world's appetite for seafood. As a result, fish are taken out of the
ocean faster than they can reproduce. [[This can
cause]{.underline}]{.mark} obvious problems up to and including
[[**extinction** of **especially vulnerable**
species]{.underline}]{.mark} (thus the catchy but grim headline on the
HuffPo story, "Scientists Predict Salt-Water Fish Extinction"). Frankly,
[extinction is not the biggest problem.
**[Overfishing]{.mark}**]{.underline} reduces the abundance of
vulnerable species, but it [**also [alters ecosystem structure and
function]{.mark}**[, as other species react]{.mark} to the reduced
abundance through what ecologists call "ecological cascades." [Valuable

be replaced by]{.mark} more [opportunistic, "weedy" species. **Under
severe fishing pressure**, the ability of marine food webs to sustain
themselves can be compromised]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a real problem
with the challenges that lie ahead from climate change. When our oceans
suffer, we do too. Overfishing affects the three billion people around
the world who rely on seafood as a source of protein and millions more
that depend on healthy fisheries for their livelihoods. Furthermore,
poor management costs the world's fisheries \$50 billion annually.

#### Overfishing destroys biodiversity in the Arctic

It is time to create a multilateral Arctic fisheries management plan
before a moratorium on fishing in Arctic high seas sunsets in 2037. We
have an opportunity to get this right, but not for long. Signatories to
the 2021 moratorium include Canada, China, Denmark (in respect of the
Faroe Islands and Greenland), the European Union, Iceland, Japan,
Norway, South Korea, Russia, and the United States. This band of
signatories is significant in that it includes both Arctic nations that
have territorial Arctic Ocean access and authorities and those that do
not but have made it clear they would like to be involved in Arctic
resource extraction. At this point, there is not much lost from agreeing
not to fish in the Arctic. Scientists don\'t know what fish species
currently live in the Arctic, let alone their populations or commercial
viability. The ice cover makes access dangerous. Getting to the Arctic
is expensive, infrastructure is minimal, and the vast Arctic region
suffers the tyranny of distance. Current fish prices and fish stock
levels mean that operating in the Arctic likely is not worth the risk or
the cost. [[Overfishing]{.underline}]{.mark} and climate change are
[likely to [lead to multiple fish stocks collapsing]{.mark}, which will
decrease supply and increase prices]{.underline}. These deterrents
won\'t last forever. The moratorium does have an end date. The ice is
melting. Overfishing and climate change are likely to lead to multiple
fish stocks collapsing, which will decrease supply and increase prices.
At the same time, demand is expected to continue to rise. As the Arctic
evolves, so too will the demands on fisheries. Although current fish
populations and commercial viability are unknown, it is reasonable to
expect [that [there are valuable seafood commodities in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}---and even if there are not, it would be
foolhardy not to plan for increased fisheries activity in the Arctic. In
fact, Alaska and Russia are gearing up to start fishing after the 2037
deadline. The Arctic Ocean high seas are the last global commons. [Never
before has the opportunity existed to properly manage
fisheries]{.underline} in an ocean without overfishing. The challenges
of accessing the Arctic, as well as the Arctic Ocean\'s geography, mean
that these high seas could be treated as a limited-entry fishery. Under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Arctic
high seas are not accessible except via an Arctic nation\'s exclusive
economic zone (EEZ), and UNCLOS also allows for nations to dictate
whether other nations will be permitted to transit their EEZs with
fishing gear on board. Because of this, [the Arctic high seas have the
potential to be a limited-entry, cooperatively and sustainably managed
fishery. This is the only ocean in the world that has ever had, or will
ever have, this opportunity.]{.underline} In the world of fisheries
management, properly managing a limited access region with invested
stakeholders is the simplest and most effective strategy. The best
practices for science, governance, and law enforcement for fisheries
management are well known[. Fisheries management is a mature field and,
if managed properly, fisheries can provide economic stability and
high-value/low-input protein in perpetuity.]{.underline} Fisheries
management is a mature field and, if managed properly, fisheries can
provide economic stability and high-value/low-input protein in
perpetuity. Limiting access to the Arctic high seas to just Arctic
Ocean-adjacent nations introduces a global resource equity problem.
Arctic nations and those with the ability to access the Arctic are
generally the wealthier and less food-insecure in the world. If access
to the high seas is limited to Arctic nations only, one (or more) of the
"gatekeeping" nations could unilaterally decide to allow access to other
interested parties outside of the agreement. To avoid this situation and
more equitably allow access to resources, a limited-entry agreement with
strong science, management, and oversight could be formed to include
non-Arctic nations that want to access Arctic high seas for fishing.
Historically, armed conflicts have occurred over fisheries. There is no
shortage of examples of nations stealing fish from other nations. There
are certainly examples of people taking too much and destroying the hope
of a long-term income and food source. [[The way to prevent the
Arctic]{.mark} from becoming the last global commons to succumb to
tragedy [is to prioritize Arctic fisheries
management]{.mark}]{.underline}, with an eye on limited global entry and
agreements. [But [we must act now]{.mark}. Agreements can lead to
economic and food security for partners; [a lack of coordination will
lead to conflict, environmental degradation, and overfishing]{.mark}.
The clock is ticking.]{.underline}

Biodiversity in the arctic\
The Arctic is made up of a number of different communities of plants and
animals supported by specific ecoregions; permanently frozen tundra,
boreal forests, grasslands, wetlands, and ice sheets and glaciers (AMAP,
2016). Arctic biomes are often defined by how water moves through or is
stored within them because they are characterized by a variety of
freshwater ecosystems. As the Arctic water cycle changes, the biomes and
their ecosystems are changing as well.

**[Without taking into account the microorganisms, [the Arctic
ecosystems support more than 21,000 species]{.mark} of plants, fungi,
and animals]{.underline}**, or even endoparasites (Barry et al., 2013).
This is without taking into account that many species remain yet
undescribed or undiscovered (Bluhm et al., 2011). If we compare this to
other areas, the Arctic has relatively few species, but even though they
are less rich in species, **[[the Arctic region contributes
significantly to global biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is
because Arctic ecosystems are recognized for their **[highly adapted,
extreme environment-resistant species that fill multiple unique
ecological niches.]{.underline}**

According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the term
"biodiversity" means the variability among living organisms from all
sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic
ecosystems and ecological complexes of which they are a part. This
includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.

**[[Biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}** is important because it refers
to the variety of life on earth that **[[keeps the ecological system we
live in working]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each species has a unique niche
or role to play in an ecosystem since living creatures depend on each
other to survive. The strong **[[interaction between species leads to
cascading impacts from one species to another]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
which is why the loss of specific species greatly conditions the
survival of others that benefit from the previous.

This polar region is recognized for its cold-adapted species that have
developed genetic diversity, reflecting great adaptation. **[The
[pool]{.mark} of genes [developed in the Arctic
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** therefore [**[unique and contributes greatly
to planet biodiversity]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In addition to these
distinctive genes, the **[[Arctic ecosystems]{.mark} indirectly
[contribute to shaping global biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[because of the impact it causes on the rest of the Earth's
climate]{.underline}**]{.mark} and ecosystems (Michel et al., 2012).

Glacial ecosystems\
Anesio and Laybourn-Parry (2012), argue that the cryosphere is a biome
even though it isn't characterized as a biome in most textbooks.
Although they haven't always been given this credit, glaciers and ice
sheets are Earth's largest freshwater ecosystems and they comprise
several biodiverse habitats. Glacier ecosystems occur on the ice, in the
ice, and under the ice and they can be divided into supraglacial,
englacial, and subglacial ecosystems (Hodson et al., 2008). The biome
they form is very distinct from others and it is dominated by
microorganisms, both autotrophs and heterotrophs (Hodson et al., 2008;
Anesio & Laybourn-Parry, 2012).

Cold-adapted (psychrotrophs) and cold-loving (psychrophilic)
microorganisms that are actively metabolizing on glaciers and ice sheets
have a range of unique genes and adaptations. They have the ability to
produce anti-freezing proteins, cold-active enzymes, and exopolymeric
substances that provide cell protection against the damaging effects of
the cold (Anesio & Laybourn-Parry, 2012). These microbial communities
also play an interesting role in biogeochemical transformations (carbon
fixation and respiration, iron cycling and methanogenesis) with
implications that reach global scale (Hodson et al., 2008).

We have relatively little information about the functional diversity of
**[[glacial microbes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and their role in
biogeochemical processes, but we are aware that they are valuable
organisms able to adapt and thrive extreme habitats and, as explained in
Green´s et al. (2008) paper, studying these organisms can **[offer us
possible responses to climate chang]{.underline}**e. Climate change
compromises the survival of this pool of distinctive genes and
conditions biodiversity as alterations to glaciers and ice sheets
translate to surrounding **[ecosystems that]{.underline}**, at the same
time, **[[have repercussions on the rest of the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is not just about the loss of the polar
hemispheres, but about how this conditions the world as we know it.

Terrestrial Ecosystems\
The Arctic terrestrial ecosystem is normally saturated with water as a
consequence of always being covered in snow, excepting the warmer months
of the year. Moreover, permafrost lies underneath the tundra, also
helping to keep moisture, as well as nutrients, during the summer months
(Callaghan et al., 2005).

Tundra plants survive by adapting to extreme conditions. In the winter,
they are protected by the snow that covers them (Callaghan et al.,
2005). In the spring, plants come alive by obtaining warmth from the
soil, keeping moist and unexposed by growing in mats close to the
ground.

The arctic terrestrial ecosystem is recognized for its low primary
production and plant biomass (Schmidt et al., 2002). The low production
is a consequence of the fact that the area of available tundra is small.
In addition, there is a short growing season due to the temperatures,
snow cover, permafrost, and the high proportion of photosynthetically
less efficient cryptogams in the plant communities (Shaver & Jonasson,
2001).

There is an accumulation of organic matter, as a result of the higher
production than decomposition rate, caused by the temperature dependence
of microorganisms. This leads to a high food supply that diverse
species, such as saprophagic arthropods as well as vertebrates, come to
take advantage of (Jonasson et al., 1999). In addition, plants are
generally nitrogen- and/or phosphorus-limited (Schmidt et al., 2002) and
compete against microbes for nutrients, resulting in a high proportion
of biogenic salts being microbially fixed (Jonasson et al., 1999; Shaver
& Jonasson, 2001).

Marine Ecosystems\
The Arctic Ocean is a young ocean with an evolutionary origin of
seaweeds, marine invertebrates and mammals that dates back to 3.5
million years ago (Adey et al., 2008). The seasons without ice date to
the last 10,000 years, which means that ecosystems belonging to Arctic
coastal waters are even younger (Weslawski et al., 2010). The fact that
it is a young ocean causes it to have lower biodiversity compared to
marine ecosystems that are found at lower latitudes (Adey et al., 2008;
Michel et al., 2012). Even though there appears to be a comparatively
smaller number of species that support the marine food web, these
species are of great complexity and diversity and they can be found in
abundant biomasses. These species hold an immense ecological importance
since they are essential to maintain diverse trophic pathways within
Arctic marine ecosystems.

As stated in Michel's et al. (2012) paper, the current biodiversity
estimates suggest that, while there are many species yet to be
discovered, the marine Arctic includes several thousand species of
microbes and protists, over 2000 species of algae, and 5000 animal
species, including hundreds of zooplankton taxa dominated by crustaceans
and thousands of unicellular and multicellular benthic taxa.\
The Arctic ecosystem is considered phagophyllic, which means it is
associated with seasonal ice and the functioning of marine arctic
ecosystems is linked to key physiographic and hydrographic features of
the Arctic Ocean, which include temperature, salinity, stratification,
connection to other oceans, etc. (Michel et al., 2012). Fluctuations in
these features affect the organisms that are conditioned by them. The
Arctic ecosystem is based around algae which is one of the most abundant
organisms and depends on this sea ice and is at the bottom of the food
chain, supporting all other species (Barnes & Tarling, 2017). These
organisms are found in such considerable biomasses that they create
clear, nutrient-free water in the winter months and intense blooms in
the summer (Smetacek & Nicol, 2005; Barnes & Tarling, 2017). In the
summer, production becomes high due to 24 hours of sunlight that allows
continuous photosynthesis to be possible. There are also high
near-surface nutrient concentrations due to vertical mixing through a
combination of wind-mixing and upwelling. Diatoms, which are very
efficient producers, are dominant in these conditions (Dunbar, 1982).

Marine organisms are distributed unevenly in the ocean because of the
uneven mixing and the upwelling (Stempniewicz et al., 2007). Regions
such as glacier fronts, marginal ice zones or estuaries, where different
water masses mix, are often rich feeding sites (Dunbar, 1982).
Continental shelves are highly dynamic environments where most of the
biological production in the Arctic Ocean takes place and a broad range
of biodiversity is found. They are habitats that support unique
communities of organisms because there is a wide range of environmental
conditions on these shelves. The conditions go from gradients in
temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations to changes in the
biogeochemical cycling of carbon caused by the influence of the annual
sea ice (Steffens et al., 2006).

[[Co-extinctions **annihilate planetary life**]{.mark} during extreme
environmental change]{.underline}

Abstract

Climate change and [human activity are dooming species at an
unprecedented rate]{.underline} via a plethora of direct and indirect,
often synergic, mechanisms. Among these, [primary
extinctions]{.underline} driven by environmental change [could be just
the tip of an enormous extinction iceberg.]{.underline} As our
understanding of the importance of ecological interactions in shaping
ecosystem identity advances, it is becoming clearer how the
disappearance of consumers following the depletion of their resources
--- a process known as 'co-extinction' --- is more likely the major
driver of biodiversity loss. Although the general relevance of
co-extinctions is supported by a sound and robust theoretical
background, the challenges in obtaining empirical information about
ongoing (and past) co-extinction events complicate the assessment of
their relative contributions to the rapid decline of species diversity
even in well-known systems, let alone at the global scale. By subjecting
a large set of virtual Earths to different trajectories of extreme
environmental change (global heating and cooling), and by tracking
species loss up to the complete annihilation of all life either
accounting or not for co-extinction processes, we show how [[ecological
dependencies **amplify**]{.mark} the direct [effects]{.mark} of
environmental change on the collapse of planetary diversity by [**up to
ten times**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Introduction

Being in the midst of the sixth mass extinction1, it is fitting to
quantify the relative contribution of different mechanisms driving
catastrophic biodiversity loss. Drivers directly related to
anthropogenic modifications of the biosphere are apparent and
well-described: habitat destruction, over-exploitation, and biotic
invasions2. Similarly, the effects of environmental change (e.g.,
temperature rise, increased droughts, ocean acidification, et cetera)
can be easily interpreted --- when the environmental conditions of a
certain locality become incompatible with the tolerance limits of
inhabiting species, in many cases these will go locally extinct, just
like fish in an aquarium with a broken thermostat (even if there are
counter examples of species that have been capable of rapid adaptation
to novel environmental conditions3). Yet, there are other, more
complicated mechanisms that can exacerbate species loss. In particular,
it is becoming increasingly evident how [biotic
interactions]{.underline}, in addition to permitting the emergence and
maintenance of diversity, also [build up complex networks through which
[the loss of one species can make more]{.mark} species
[disappear]{.mark} (a process known as 'co-extinction'), [and]{.mark}
possibly **[bring entire systems to an unexpected,
sudden]{.mark}**]{.underline} regime shift, or even [**[total
collapse]{.underline}**4]{.mark},5,6,7,8,9.

In a simplified view, the idea of co-extinction reduces to the obvious
conclusion that [a consumer cannot survive without its
resources.]{.underline} Because resource and consumer interactions in
natural systems (e.g., food webs) are organized in various hierarchical
levels of complexity (e.g., trophic levels), it follows that the
[[removal of resources could result in]{.mark} the
**[cascading]{.mark}**]{.underline} (bottom-up)
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** of several higher-level
consumers8,10. Several studies based on either simulated or real-world
data suggest that we should expect most events of species loss to cause
co-extinctions5, as corroborated by the worrisome, unnatural rate at
which populations and species are now disappearing11, and which goes far
beyond what one expects as a simple consequence of human endeavour1. In
fact, [[**even the most resilient species** will]{.mark} inevitably
[fall]{.mark}]{.underline} victim [[to the **synergies among extinction
drivers**]{.underline}]{.mark}2 as extreme stresses drive biological
communities to collapse. Furthermore, co-extinctions are often triggered
well before the complete loss of an entire species12, so that even
oscillations in the population size of a species could result in the
local disappearance of other species depending on the first13.

[This makes it difficult to be optimistic]{.underline} about the future
of species diversity in the ongoing trajectory of global change, let
alone in the case of additional external, planetary-scale catastrophes.
A previous study14 contended this idea by using the remarkable tolerance
of tardigrades to extreme temperature, pressure, and radiation as a
reference to calculate the likelihood of global sterilization on an
Earth-like planet following different, dramatic astrophysical events.
The stunning conclusion of that study is that life on our planet has the
potential to survive asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray
bursts14. This ostensibly reassuring news highlights how some scientists
still tend to disregard the role of co-extinctions within collapsing
communities in driving global biodiversity loss, while focusing on
individual species' tolerance limits as the only criteria relevant to
species survival in a changing world. Ecologists know the optimism is
not supported quantitatively, but can we estimate the magnitude of the
bias?

Here [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} attempt to do this by
[[combin]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [real-world ecological and
[**environmental data** to **generate**]{.mark} several **[virtual
Earths]{.mark}**]{.underline} populated by interconnected
species-interaction networks where we allow species to move and adapt,
that we then subjected to extreme, global environmental change.
[By]{.underline} comparing scenarios of extinctions based only on
species' environmental tolerances with others
[**[accounting]{.underline}**]{.mark} also [[**for co-extinctions**, we
show]{.mark} that [**neglecting to consider** **the cascading
effect**]{.mark} of biod]{.underline}iversity [loss [leads to a **large
overestimation of the robustness of planetary
life**]{.mark}]{.underline} to global change.

Results and Discussion

[[We populated **2000 'virtual Earths'**]{.underline}]{.mark} with
species-like entities arranged in interconnected ecological communities.
We then subjected those Earths to catastrophic environmental change
eventually resulting in the annihilation of all planetary life. We
randomly assigned species to communities on the basis of their tolerance
to local climatic conditions, and then we arranged them into structured
food webs that we built by linking resources to consumers under various
ecological constraints (e.g., trophic level, consumer specificity, and
functional-trait compatibility; see Methods). Before and while applying
environmental change to the virtual Earths, we simulated dispersal
processes between communities, with the success of colonization
contingent on dispersal distance, and on the ability of a potential
colonizer to enter the target community by displacing other species
through superior competitive ability. This gave some biogeographical and
macro-ecological realism to our simulated planet.

To keep our model simple yet realistic, we focused on local temperatures
and the thermal tolerances of species to them, limiting our simulations
to the terrestrial domain, because marine ecosystems likely experience
different susceptibility to incremental changes in temperature given the
higher specific heat capacity of water relative to air. Initial
temperature of each virtual Earth mimicked that of our planet today, and
we assigned species ecologically plausible features (temperature
tolerance limits, trophic level, specialization) obtained from empirical
datasets (see Methods). We applied two main trajectories of
environmental change --- a monotonic linear increase in temperatures, or
a progressive cooling (e.g., a 'nuclear winter') such as that predicted
following multiple nuclear detonations15 or an asteroid impact14. To
increase the realism of our simulated trajectories, and to obtain
conservative curves of diversity loss relative to incremental changes in
temperature, we permitted species to adapt to some extent to changing
conditions by extending their tolerance limits in the same direction as
the environmental change experienced. Furthermore, we permitted the
replenishment of depleted populations through regular immigration of
recruits from surrounding areas (see Methods for details).

For both trajectories of environmental change, we tracked the loss of
diversity within two, separate scenarios until complete species
annihilation. In the first scenario, we followed the logic underlying
Sloan and colleagues14, by dooming species to extinction only according
to their individual environmental tolerances. In the second scenario, we
also accounted for co-extinctions4,5,6,7,8,9,10. This permitted us to
quantify, by orders of magnitude, the gap between the diversity loss due
to a species' inability to cope with changing conditions, and that due
to the domino effect of co-extinctions following primary extinctions. We
assumed that the co-extinction of a consumer could be triggered before
the complete depletion of all of its resources, and that resources freed
up by the extinction of consumers could be redistributed to some extent
to surviving consumers in the network12 (see Methods for details).

[[Throughout the]{.mark} full set of [**simulations**, we randomly
varied]{.mark} the [parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} controlling the
thresholds for the amount of resource depletion triggering a consumer's
co-extinction, and the degree of possible reallocation of unused
resources. In this way, we explored a wide range of potential model
settings, from optimistic ones regarding the robustness of ecological
networks to species loss (with consumers going extinct only after the
full depletion of most of their resources, and most resources freed up
by the consumers' extinction reallocated to remaining consumers), to
pessimistic ones where small losses in resources triggered
co-extinctions, and with little adaptability of the network. Similarly,
in each simulation we varied at random other important model parameters
controlling the amount of initial species diversity, the number of
populated localities in the virtual Earth, and the frequency of
colonization events (both before and during environmental change). This
allowed us to identify both conservative upper and lower boundaries to
our projections, and to investigate the sensitivity of our results to
model assumptions.

The scenario curves depicting the diversity decline in the two
temperature-change trajectories show how not accounting for
co-extinction processes provides an unrealistic, and exceedingly
optimistic perspective on the persistence of species diversity in
natural communities (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, we report the minimum and
maximum recorded species diversities over all simulations, showing how
the most severe cases of diversity loss are not in fact much different
from the mildest ones.

Sloan and colleagues14 proposed to use the tolerance limits of the most
resistant species to quantify life's resilience on our planet. A more
informative measure is in the area under the curve of global diversity
survival versus environmental change (consistent with measures of
ecosystem robustness to the loss of diversity16,17). When this measure
is used to compare the two different outcomes of species diversity, it
becomes easier to quantify the relative underestimation of the
robustness of planetary life resulting when overlooking co-extinctions.
In the heating trajectory in particular, not accounting for
co-extinctions led to an underestimation of robustness varying from 61
to 1442% (median 403%) across the wide range of model settings we
applied. In the cooling trajectory, the underestimation was more
attenuated, but still large, and ranged from 30 to 934% (median 222%).

The differences in robustness overestimation originate from the
different patterns of primary (i.e., climate-change driven) extinctions
in the global heating and cooling trajectories (due, in turn, to
asymmetries in species tolerance limits to low and high temperatures),
with the cooling scenario projecting a much steeper decline in species
diversity than the heating one (Fig. 1).

Combined with the similar curve of diversity loss obtained when
co-extinctions were also taken into account, the differences in the
primary extinction trajectories suggest that local food webs had
different robustness to either climate heating or cooling. We tested
this hypothesis by 'disassembling' a random sample of 1000 food webs
from all simulations by removing species progressively from the least to
the most tolerant to warm or cold temperatures. After each species
removal, we modelled co-extinctions (in the same way as we did in our
main simulations), and we kept track of the remaining diversity. The
resulting curves, depicting the (co-extinction driven) decline of local
diversity following direct species removal, provide an intuitive measure
of network robustness to heating and cooling. In addition, we identified
approximate upper and lower boundaries for robustness, obtained by
removing species in decreasing and increasing order of their
contribution to network persistence (that we quantified as the number of
each species' associated resources), and a reference curve obtained by
removing species in random order.

As expected, we found that these resultant food webs were more robust to
cooling than to heating (Fig. 2). In both cases, food-web robustness was
worse than that depicted by the random reference curve, and much closer
to the lower robustness boundary than to the upper one. This result is
also consistent with the emerging evidence of Late Quaternary
extinctions exacerbated by rapid heating, but not cooling, events18,19.
This implies an additional warning for the future of biodiversity,
because the robustness of simulated food webs to heating was largely
consistent with the lower boundary obtained by removing resources in
decreasing order of their importance for consumer persistence. In other
words, at least in our simulations, heating tends to remove the
ecologically most important species first.

This result arises because of the differences in the distributions of
upper and lower temperature-tolerance limits in plants and animals. In
our dataset, the lower and upper tolerance limits in plants were
1.3 ± 4.7 and 23.7 ± 4.8 °C (median ± 1σ), respectively, while in
animals they were 23.4 ± 12.2 and 35.0 ± 4.8 °C, respectively. The
overall greater tolerance to higher compared to lower temperatures in
both plants and animals explains the faster global diversity loss due to
environmental change observed in the cooling compared to global heating
(i.e., the blue curves in Fig. 1). Furthermore, the relative difference
between plants and animal adaptation to low temperatures is much larger
than their relative difference in adaptation to high temperatures. In
the cooling scenario, this means that when cold conditions have driven
most animals to extinction, many plant species still persist;
conversely, global heating will drive plants to extinction before many
animals exceed their upper tolerance limits.

Increasing initial global diversity, as well as the number of
communities and populated localities, raised robustness in the
environmental-tolerance scenario (Figs S1, S2). This is not surprising,
considering that at least in our model, both global diversity and
abundance in populated localities are expected to be positively
correlated with species' ranges (see Methods). However, initial global
diversity had a negligible effect on robustness in the co-extinction
scenario (both for the heating and cooling trajectories; Figs. S1, S2).

In our model we implemented two separate mechanisms by which species can
move from one locality to another: (i) a 'species
dispersal/colonization' mechanism (Section 8, Methods), to which we are
referring below, and (ii) a mechanism of 'community rescue via exogenous
recruitment' (Section 9 in Methods). While the latter mechanism is
capable of delaying local extinction events, it cannot alter community
structure (at least qualitatively); on the contrary, the first mechanism
can lead to interesting effects on both local and global species
diversity.

The outcome of a colonization attempt is determined by the colonizer's
trophic level, its functional similarity to local species, and its
degree of tolerance to local environmental conditions. Thus, a colonizer
successfully establishes itself in a new area if better adapted to local
temperature range than resident competitors when those are present, or
if well adapted to local temperature range in the absence of competitors
(with the additional constraint, in the co-extinction scenario, of being
able to find a place in the local food web). Furthermore, the likelihood
of colonization success is also limited by a measure of 'invasion
susceptibility', which takes into account local diversity in the
environmental change scenario, and network structure in the
co-extinction scenario. Even if measured at the community level,
invasion susceptibility partially captures the idea that resident
species become more adapted to the multi-faceted ecological and
environmental aspects of their home locality (besides basic climatic
features such as temperature extremes) as the community becomes more
diverse, and its structure becomes more complex, possibly increasing its
resistance to biological invasions20.

The number of preliminary dispersal and colonization events (done before
simulating the two trajectories of temperature change) had no effect on
planetary robustness in both the environmental tolerance and the
co-extinction scenarios (Figs S3, S4). Conversely, in both the global
heating and cooling trajectories, increasing the amount of dispersal and
colonization during climate change had a detrimental effect on
robustness in the environmental tolerance scenario --- increased
biodiversity loss due to primary (i.e., climate-driven) extinctions
only. This highlights the important role of biotic homogenization as an
additional driver (and possibly, accelerator) of biodiversity loss21.

As we explain in the Methods, a successful colonization event can either
(a) increase local diversity in cases where the colonizer replaces ≥ 1
local species in only some of their resource-consumer interactions
without driving them to extinction, (b) leave local diversity as is when
the colonizer drives one local species to extinction, or (c) reduces
diversity when the colonizer outcompetes \> 1 local species. Our results
show that the third case was the most common in our simulations, with
frequent events where strong colonizers establishing themselves in new
areas had detrimental effects on local diversity. Clearly, when a
species expands its geographic range via successful colonization, it
also gains new opportunities for dispersal/colonization. Therefore, it
is intuitive that generalist species with broad thermal niches and
strong competitive ability can spread easily throughout the virtual
Earth, while driving to local extinction several weaker competitors.
This explains the patterns in Figs. S3 and S4, and is a phenomenon
consistent with what is commonly observed in real-world systems facing
the daunting problem of biological invasions2,21.

However, the likelihood of dispersal and colonization during
environmental change had no effect on robustness in the co-extinction
scenario, nor on the ratio of robustness between the two scenarios. This
suggests that the speed and the magnitude of co-extinctions overshadow
the relatively smaller effect of diversity loss caused by biological
invasions, and that co-extinctions are likely a much more important
driver of global biodiversity decline than biotic homogenization.

[Neither did species adaptability]{.underline} to change affect
robustness in either scenario, nor could it [decelerate overall
diversity loss]{.underline} (Figs. S3, S4). This latter result is
clearly bound to the selected range of probabilities for local
population adaptation to novel conditions. Although arbitrary, we
considered the selected probabilities (ranging from 0 \[no
adaptability\] to 0.0001) to be conservative (i.e., ensuring high
adaptability in the system). In fact, the adaptability probability at
each step of the simulation corresponds to the fraction of populations
gaining greater thermal tolerance to changing conditions. Given the
large number of starting populations in each virtual Earth (on average
31781 ± 16248 S.D.), and the high number of steps per simulation (5000,
with an average global temperature change of \~ 1 °C every 100 steps),
the expected number of adaptation events throughout one model run is not
negligible (even if declining with time/diversity loss, which makes
ecological sense).

Not surprisingly, much of the variability in the outcomes of our
simulations arises from the choice of the minimum amount of resource
loss capable of triggering co-extinctions in consumers (co-extinction
threshold), while the plasticity of food webs towards resource
reallocation (i.e., the reallocation ratio in the co-extinction model)
had a minor impact on global patterns of diversity loss (Fig. S5). In
our simulations we let the co-extinction threshold vary randomly between
0 and 1, where in the extreme scenario of 0 a consumer goes extinct
following even a minimal loss in its resources, thus leading to
pessimistic scenarios of diversity loss overall. The opposite extreme of
1 means that a consumer goes extinct only after complete depletion of
its resources, depicting an opposite, overly optimistic scenario12.
However, even under the latter, unrealistic assumption, the differences
in robustness of planetary life with and without co-extinctions held
firm.

Our modelling framework also offers a unique opportunity to benchmark
the fascinating hypothesis that tardigrades could survive an
astrophysical catastrophe14. In response, we explicitly included
different species of tardigrade-like extremophiles in our simulations by
assigning them a broad temperature tolerance22,23, and embedding them
within trophic webs as grazers and micro-predators24. Despite their
remarkable resistance to environmental change slowing their decline, our
tardigrade-like species still could not survive co-extinctions. In fact,
the transition from the state of complete tardigrade persistence to
their complete extinction (in the co-extinction scenario) was abrupt,
and happened far from their tolerance limits, and close to global
diversity collapse (around 5 °C of heating or cooling; Fig. 1). This
suggests that environmental change could promote simultaneous collapses
in trophic guilds when they reach critical thresholds of environmental
change. When these critical environmental conditions are breached,
[[**even the most resilient organisms** are still susceptible to **rapid
extinction** because they depend]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part,
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the presence of and interactions among many
[[other species]{.mark}.]{.underline} This highlights the real danger of
modelling future diversity loss by focusing on the tolerances of single
species in isolation from ecological theory25.

Of course, our model is an exceptionally simplified representation of
ecological reality, for it would be impossible to model all species'
interactions on the planet. Nevertheless, despite its simplicity, [our
model yielded results consistent with real-world phenomena.]{.underline}
For example, the near-annihilation of planetary life recorded in the
end-Permian extinction event was associated with a \~ 6 °C increase in
global average temperature following volcanic eruptions26. Ignoring for
a moment the obvious differences with present fauna and flora (that we
used as a reference for assigning ecologically plausible tolerance
limits to our virtual species), a temperature increase of a similar
magnitude would be just enough for a co-extinction-driven collapse of
global biodiversity based on our simulations (Fig. 1).

In the case of the cooling trajectory, our results are also realistic
compared to the global cooling event following the Chicxulub asteroid
impact. The latest reconstructions estimate that the impact would have
caused a 16 °C average drop in global surface temperature within three
years (with at least 15 years needed to return to pre-impact
temperatures)27. According to our projections, such a decrease in
temperature would be three times larger the one needed to doom planetary
life through co-extinction processes (Fig. 1b). On the one hand, this
leaves little doubt about the main processes driving the extinction of
the dinosaurs, irrespective of their different thermoregulation
strategies28, because the large drop in temperature alone would have
been enough to wipe out both endo- and ectotherms alike. On the other
hand, that other taxa obviously survived the Chicxulub-induced nuclear
winter highlights an important difference between our model and the real
world. Our model parameterized a relatively homogeneous change in
temperature across the virtual Earth landscape (with only a slight
adjustment for faster changes at the highest latitudes that emulate
current patterns in global heating). In contrast, Late Cretaceous Earth
experienced a heterogeneous distribution in temperature changes (see
Fig. 5 in Bardeen et al.27), explaining how some species survived by
exploiting sparsely available climatic refugia. While exploring how
spatial heterogeneity in climate change affects extinction patterns and
processes at the global scale is beyond the scope of this study, it is a
fruitful vein of inquiry for future applications and modifications of
our modelling framework.

In fact, it might be possible to increase our model's complexity by
explicitly implementing population dynamics, or multiple species niche
dimensions, but adding complexity would add new assumptions, and
complicate interpretation. Regardless of all its potential limitations,
[our]{.underline} parsimonious [exercise clearly highlights the large
effect of co-extinctions on the overall robustness of planetary
life]{.underline} to extreme environmental change, [and reinforces
the]{.underline} now well-established [notion that minimizing
biodiversity loss is the best approach to prevent environmental
collapse.]{.underline}

Science fiction author Arthur C Clarke once observed, "How inappropriate
to call this planet Earth when it is quite clearly Ocean." Good point,
well made. [The oceans clearly dominate the world
spatially]{.underline}, encompassing around 72 per cent of the surface
of the planet. The vast extent of the oceans only tells part of the
story, however. [**The [oceans are critical to the global environment
and human survival]{.mark} in numerous ways** -- they are [vital
to]{.mark} the global [nutrient cycling]{.mark}, represent [a key
repository]{.mark} and supporter [of]{.mark} biological
[diversity]{.mark} on a world scale [and play]{.mark} a [fundamental
role in driving the **global atmospheric system**.]{.mark} Coastal and
marine environments support and sustain key habitats and living
resources, notably fisheries and aquaculture. These resources continue
to [provide a **critical source of food for hundreds of millions of
people**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The fishing industry supports the
livelihoods of an estimated 540 million people worldwide and fisheries
supply more than 15 per cent of the animal protein consumed by 4.2
billion people globally. [Moreover, [the oceans]{.mark} are an
increasing source of energy resources and [**underpin** the global
economy through]{.mark} sea borne [trade]{.mark}.]{.underline} Overall,
it has been estimated that [61 per cent of global GNP is sourced from
the oceans and coastal areas within 100km of the sea]{.underline}.
[Coasts and marine zones]{.underline} also [provide
essential]{.underline}, but often not fully acknowledged, [ecosystem
services]{.underline}. Coasts and marine zones are therefore of critical
importance across scales, from the global to the regional, national and
sub-national coastal community levels. At the same time the oceans also
remain largely (95 per cent) unexplored.

[could bring **social unrest**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[civil wars]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [the]{.underline} UN Food and
Agriculture Organization ([FAO) said]{.underline}.
[[Demand]{.underline}]{.mark} for food [[will rise
**rapidly**]{.underline}]{.mark} over the next few decades [as
the]{.underline} world [population surpasses 9 billion and increasingly
wealthy people improve their diets, consuming more
calories]{.underline}, said Hiroyuki Konuma, the assistant
director-general of FAO Asia-Pacific, as the body launched a one-week
regional food security conference in Ulan Bator. But as [the need for
more food increases]{.underline}, [[the world is spending
less]{.underline}]{.mark} and less money [[on agricultural
research]{.underline}]{.mark}, [causing]{.underline} many [scientists
to]{.underline} [doubt]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} food
[production can keep up with demand]{.underline} growth. [\'\'If we fail
to meet our goal and a food shortage occurs, **[there will be a high
risk of social and political unrest, civil wars and terrorism, and world
security as a whole might be affected]{.mark}**]{.underline},\'\' said
Konuma. The challenge is especially demanding in developing nations,
which need to boost crops by a staggering 77 per cent, he said. The
Asia-Pacific would be left with more than half a billion chronically
hungry people even if the region meets its millennium development goal
of cutting that number to 12 per cent of the population, he said.
[Despite progress]{.underline} made in fighting global hunger, [the
world still has 842 million undernourished people, according to
FAO]{.underline}, of which nearly two thirds live in the Asia-Pacific.
One in four children under five years old are stunted due to
malnutrition. The UN body outlined two main options: increase arable
land areas and boost productivity rates. But available arable land is
almost fully exploited, and production growth rates have been lacklustre
for the past two decades. During the green revolution in the 1980s,
productivity rates for rice and wheat increased by 3.5 per cent
annually, but for the past 20 years the rate has been stuck at 0.6 to
0.8 per cent. The growth rate needs to be stable at around 1 per cent if
the world is to have a theoretical chance to avoid serious shortages,
said Konuma. Water scarcity in big food-producing nations like China is
worsening, and many farmers are increasingly tempted to shift production
from food to bioenergy, a popular option to cut emissions of
climate-changing greenhouse gases. [[Climate change is worsening]{.mark}
the situation]{.underline}, [as more frequent extreme weather events
devastate crops. In the past three years, Australia, Canada, China,

[For the past quarter-century, the [Arctic]{.mark} has been a [unique
zone of **cooperation**]{.mark} among the eight countries of the high
north: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the
United States. **[Even when relations]{.mark} between Moscow and the
West [soured]{.mark},** the [Arctic]{.mark} [Council]{.mark}'s work was
a [reminder]{.mark} that [multilateral partnerships could thrive]{.mark}
despite global discord.]{.underline} The point of the [Arctic
Council]{.underline} is to [foster collaboration in areas such as
scientific research, search and rescue operations and the challenges
posed by climate change. Under its auspices, friends and adversaries
alike -- as well as nonstate actors, such as Indigenous groups -- can
sit down, talk and find common ground]{.underline}. In early 2022,
lawmakers from Norway nominated the council for the Nobel Peace Prize
for its collaborative spirit. [That collaboration ended shortly after
Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} on Feb. 24, 2022. One week
after the start of the war, seven of the eight Arctic Council members
announced that they would "pause" their work with the organization.
[Russia]{.underline}, which holds the council's presidency through 2023,
[was left ostracized.]{.underline} The freeze of the Arctic Council is a
loss on many fronts. [As a scholar of Arctic security, I see
[cooperation in the **region** as **essential to global**]{.mark}
**[security]{.mark}**, and I believe an expanded set of institutions is
needed to reflect new global realities as the Arctic warms.]{.underline}
Security and cooperation in the Arctic The eight Arctic countries formed
the Arctic Council in 1996. While the council explicitly steers clear of
military issues, its members are stewards of the Arctic region.
Unsurprisingly, the organization has grown in importance with global
warming. Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new
shipping routes and, likely, expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas
and other critical minerals -- changes that could spur conflict if not
handled carefully. Through the council, the Arctic states have made
agreements related to search and rescue operations, oil pollution and
scientific collaboration. The council has tracked environmental changes
in the region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment reports.
[Even when relations between East and West were at their
worst,]{.underline} including in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed
the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, [joint endeavors in the Arctic
**remained strong.**]{.underline} Pausing the work of the Arctic Council
was an understandable response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yet in
doing so, the other Arctic countries lost a valuable line of
communication with Moscow[. In time, it will be [important to **resume**
the council]{.mark} or establish a **new institution** in its
**place**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, working with Russia in the
Arctic is even more important now than it was before the invasion. From
a global security perspective, it is essential that the hot war in
Europe be prevented from spilling over into the Arctic and one of the
world's last wildernesses. **[The case for engaging
Russia]{.underline}** Consider, for example, that while tensions are at
an all-time high in Ukraine, it might be easy to mistake a flock of
geese or a meteor shower for a military attack. Having a way for errors
like these to be quickly remedied will be important in this new era of
geopolitical competition. [Preserving and enhancing cooperation in the
Arctic will take bold leadership]{.underline}. Some critics argue that
institutionalizing military dialogue with Russia in the Arctic is an
improper response to wanton aggression in Eastern Europe and could be
seen as legitimizing Russia's actions. These are valid concerns.
However, [[**giving up** on **cooperation** would be a
**mistake**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The whole world will benefit if the
high north can avoid the fate of militarization, a costly arms race and
the terrible specter of war. [Ideally, [engaging Russia within
an]{.mark} expanded set of regional institutions -- an **[invigorated
Arctic Council]{.mark}**, to be sure, but also a new military forum --
[would precipitate a **cooperation spiral**]{.mark}, increasing
cooperation [that could **help lessen tensions** **elsewhere**]{.mark}.
Even if collaboration were confined to the Arctic, this would boost
global security.]{.underline} A new Arctic? In the past, the Arctic
states sought to maintain peace and stability in their region by
divorcing contentious military issues from areas where common ground was
easier to find. This has been the modus vivendi of the Arctic Council
since its founding. Going forward, it would be better to recognize that
robust and ongoing cooperation is needed on security issues, too. Trust
between Russia and the West might never return, but cooperation in the
Arctic cannot be allowed to disappear with it.

Fran Ulmer can speak from experience about the importance of [the
[Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} and its work on finding solutions
to problems in the region. "It's [[been **hugely helpful**]{.underline}
[in getting]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Arctic [nations]{.mark} to work
[together]{.mark}]{.underline} on things like the two agreements that
were just adopted over the past two years: the search-and-rescue
agreement, and the responding-to-oil-spills agreement," she said. Ulmer
served as lieutenant governor and later as chancellor of the University
of Alaska-Anchorage before appointed in 2010 to the national Commission
on the BP Horizon Oil Spill and then in 2011 as chair of the U.S. Arctic
Research Commission. She says [[it's important to understand]{.mark} the
[significance of]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[assuming]{.underline} the Arctic [Council [chairmanship, because of the
organization's]{.mark}]{.underline} research on climate change and its
**[[impact]{.mark} on this region.]{.underline}** And the growing
importance of that work as Arctic nations ramp up development of oil and
other resources here. "To the extent that people are thinking long-term
about where's energy going to come from," she said, "the Arctic is one
of the places where it is highly likely that it will be a supply source
-- whether it's from Russian waters or Canadian waters or U.S. waters or
Norwegian waters. The opportunity to exploit those resources is due in
part to melting Arctic sea ice. "Last week, we had the lowest winter
sea-ice extent ever recorded in the Arctic," Ulmer said. And that in
turn has opened up previously inaccessible offshore areas to oil and gas
exploration and development. "Thirty percent of the undiscovered gas in
the world is in the Arctic region," she said. "Thirteen percent of the
undiscovered oil is projected to be in the Arctic region." Ulmer says
Arctic [Council]{.underline} member [[nations]{.mark} have **[worked
together]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to develop plans]{.mark} and policies
to deal [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the tricky business of
[developing]{.underline} Arctic oil [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark},
while at the same time researching the impacts of burning those fossil
fuels on the region's climate and peoples. She says [the [council
cooperates,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} its members
understand that **[they're all in it]{.mark} together**]{.underline}.
"If there's a spill someplace in the Arctic, because of Arctic Ocean
currents," she said, "it's going to affect wildlife, it's going to
affect fish, it's going to affect shorelines -- not just in one country,
but in other countries." But [[some]{.mark} observers
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[tensions are]{.mark} now
[creating divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} among Arctic Council members.
They note that Secretary of State John Kerry will lead the U.S.
delegation at the Arctic Council's ministerial meeting that convenes
Friday morning in Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of
Nunavut. But his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, won'tbe there,
reportedly as a tit-for-tat response to snubs by the Canadians, who
didn't attend an Arctic Council meeting last year in Moscow to protest
Russian aggression in Ukraine and Crimea. "[There's no way to de-link
**completely** the Arctic from geopolitics]{.underline} in the world,"
said Lawson Brigham, a UAF distinguished professor of geography and
Arctic policy and a retired strategic planner for the Coast Guard.
[[Brigham]{.mark} says he]{.underline} [[doesn't think]{.mark} the
[dispute will disrupt]{.mark} this weekend's
[meeting]{.mark}]{.underline}. He says [the Arctic [Council]{.mark}
specifically [prohibited itself from involvement in military
matters]{.mark}]{.underline} when it was formed in 1996. And [[he thinks
it's **unlikely**]{.mark} that [Russian saber-rattling]{.mark} in the
Arctic [will lead to hostilities, because]{.mark} **that would be bad
for [business]{.mark}.** "The [notion]{.mark} that we're headed to some
kind [of regional conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic -- **[[I
don't buy it,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Brigham said. "Because
[[all]{.mark} of the countries]{.underline}, including our Russian
friends, [[want to sell]{.mark} natural resources]{.underline} to the
planet." But Matt Felling, an aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, says
[Russia's military buildup]{.underline} in the region isn't going
unnoticed. "We've seen them moving military aircraft. We've seen them
boosting military muscle in the Arctic,..." he said. Felling says
Murkowski believes that [shouldn't deter the Arctic Council from its
work]{.underline}. He says Russia's involvement with the council is
essential, because it's the biggest Arctic nation with the biggest stake
in developing the region's resources.

[to]{.underline} **[seek agreement on issues]{.underline}** [such as
search and rescue, oil pollution and scientific
cooperation]{.underline}. Another one, the Arctic Frontiers conference,
wraps up Jan. 30 in Tromsø, Norway. Other meetings like the Arctic

debate.

But [such [meetings]{.mark} and institutions have been less successful
at]{.underline} **[addressing military operations]{.underline}** [in the
region]{.underline}. In part, [this is because if]{.underline} **[armed
forces]{.underline}** [are present in the Arctic, it's often connected
to some high-stakes geopolitical issue]{.underline} --- Russian activity
in Ukraine or the U.S. stance on Freedom of Navigation --- [and thus
deliberately]{.underline} **[avoided]{.underline}**. [The Arctic
Council]{.underline}, for example, [explicitly [eschew]{.mark}s any
discussion of [military matters]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic Coast
Guard Forum focuses on issues of safety, environmental stewardship, law
enforcement, and operational response --- but not military operations.

There is an Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and a limited number of
bi-lateral or multi-lateral Arctic security exercises. These provide
some opportunities for engagement but lack the consistency or clear
mission of non-military Arctic cooperative activities. Furthermore, the
Security Forces Roundtable has excluded Russia since 2014, when it
seized Crimea and launched military activity in Ukraine.

[[Creating]{.mark} a [regular]{.mark}, inclusive [discussion]{.mark} of

[military]{.underline} **[[miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

[[A **race to militarize**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Arctic,

**military [assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[coming into]{.mark} **close
[contact]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [or]{.underline}

[The [perception that there's a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[void in

increases in **ship collisions**]{.underline}, [**illegal fishing**, and

for countries]{.mark} like China [to justify]{.mark} an
**increase**]{.underline} [in [their own]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[regional capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The former scenario represents too much security. The latter could
emerge under too little. [The two]{.mark} scenarios
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[equally dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and shifting conditions could **tip the balance**]{.underline} [in

Meanwhile, [the [fragmentation of **circumpolar cooperation** is closing

[could]{.mark}]{.underline} help to [[diffuse tensions]{.mark} and
promote **confidence-building** measures]{.underline}. Prior to 2022,
there was some discussion of re-establishing joint military forums or
some form of 'code of conduct', but this dissipated quickly as Moscow's
designs on Ukraine became clear. [The chances of a predictable Arctic in
military security terms are growing slimmer.]{.underline}

The [[risk of an armed conflict]{.mark} in the Arctic
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly [**[high]{.mark}**er than it
was]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that either NATO or Moscow
is any more likely to seek a conflict in the Arctic than they were prior
to Russia's assault on Ukraine. Considering the complexity of the
operating environment, there is little incentive for Moscow -- or NATO
-- to escalate in the Arctic per se, let alone conduct high-intensity
warfare operations there.

For now, the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High
North as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and Finnish
membership of NATO

There is no sign yet (publicly at least) that either side is seeking to
change the 'facts on the ground' regarding critical international
agreements, or even press claims in areas of disagreement -- for
instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty on the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the Northeast Passage
(including the Northern Sea Route, or NSR) and the delimitation of
extended continental shelves.

Nevertheless, Russia remains determined to control 'its' Arctic and the
NSR. Over the past few years, successive waves of regulations have
increasingly restricted passage through the NSR, placing it under
Moscow's tight control. If, even as the effects of climate change are
felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of the status of the
NSR, or if the Kremlin seeks to further restrict passage along the route
(especially for foreign military vessels), there could be more serious
consideration of a US- or NATO-led Freedom of Navigation operation, even
if it increases the risk of an armed clash.

These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US
interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR
is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the
Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.

For now, the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High
North as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and Finnish
membership of NATO. The danger is that this could increase the risk of a
miscalculation provoked by an accident escalating into something worse.
More presence and platforms in a changing Arctic will undoubtedly bring
about more incidents, including environmental catastrophes and
human-made disasters, with indigenous peoples and other local
communities bearing the brunt of the impact.

Beyond that, we anticipate that [[the Arctic will remain in **limbo**
until one side]{.underline}]{.mark} or the other [[makes a move

Could Break Out in the Arctic." The Nation, February 11, 2020.

The [[exploitation of **Arctic oil**]{.mark} and gas resources and their
transport to markets in Europe and Asia [has become a]{.mark} major
economic [**priority** for Moscow]{.mark} as its hydrocarbon reserves
below the Arctic Circle begin to dry up[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite
calls at home for greater economic diversity, President Vladimir Putin's
regime continues to insist on the centrality of hydrocarbon production
to the country's economic future. In that context, production in the
Arctic has become an essential national objective, which, in turn,
requires assured access to the Atlantic Ocean via the Barents Sea and
Norway's offshore waters. Think of that waterway as vital to Russia's
energy economy in the way the Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian
Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is to the Saudis and other regional
fossil-fuel producers.

THE MILITARY DIMENSION

No less than Russia's giant energy firms, its navy must be able to enter
the Atlantic via the Barents Sea and northern Norway. Aside from its
Baltic and Black Sea ports, accessible to the Atlantic only via
passageways easily obstructed by NATO, the sole Russian harbor with
unfettered access to the Atlantic Ocean is at Murmansk on the Kola
Peninsula. Not surprisingly then, that port is also the headquarters for
Russia's Northern Fleet---its most powerful---and the site of numerous
air, infantry, missile, and radar bases along with naval shipyards and
nuclear reactors. In other words, it's among the most sensitive military
regions in Russia today.

Given all this, President Putin has substantially rebuilt that very
fleet, which fell into disrepair after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
equipping it with some of the country's most advanced warships. In 2018,
according to The Military Balance, a publication of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, it already possessed the largest number
of modern cruisers and destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with
22 attack submarines and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk
area are dozens of advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of
anti-aircraft defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military
officials indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the
Arctic the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of
hypersonic velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again
presumably to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's
Finnmark, the site of the upcoming NATO exercise.

More significant yet is the way Moscow has been strengthening its
nuclear forces in the region. Like the United States, Russia maintains a
"triad" of nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range "heavy" bombers, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Under the terms of the
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), signed by the two
countries in 2010, the Russians can deploy no more than 700 delivery
systems capable of carrying no more than 1,550 warheads. (That pact
will, however, expire in February 2021 unless the two sides agree to an
extension, which appears increasingly unlikely in the age of Trump.)
According to the Arms Control Association, the [[Russians
are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently believed to be
[[deploying]{.underline}]{.mark} the warheads they are allowed under New
START on 66 heavy bombers, 286 ICBMs, and [12 submarines with 160 SLBMs.
**[Eight]{.mark} of those**]{.underline} [[nuclear-armed subs]{.mark}
are, in fact, assigned [to the **Northern Fleet**]{.mark}]{.underline},
which means about 110 missiles with as many as 500 warheads---the exact
numbers remain shrouded in secrecy---are deployed [in the Murmansk
area.]{.underline}

[For **Russia**n nuclear strategists, such nuclear-armed
**sub**marine**s** are considered the most "survivable" of the country's
retaliatory systems[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the event of a nuclear
exchange with the United States, the country's heavy bombers and ICBMs
could prove relatively vulnerable to pre-emptive strikes as their
locations are known and can be targeted by American bombs and missiles
with near-pinpoint accuracy. Those subs, however, can leave Murmansk and
disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean at the onset of any crisis and so
presumably remain hidden from US spying eyes. To do so, however,
requires that they pass through the Barents Sea, avoiding the NATO
forces lurking nearby. For Moscow, in other words, the very possibility
of deterring a US nuclear strike hinges on its ability to defend its
naval stronghold in Murmansk, while maneuvering its submarines past
Norway's Finnmark region. [**No wonder**, then, that this area has
assumed **enormous strategic importance** for Russian military
planners]{.underline}---and the upcoming Cold Response 2020 is sure to
prove challenging to them[.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON'S ARCTIC BUILDUP

During the Cold War era, Washington viewed the Arctic as a significant
strategic arena and constructed a string of military bases across the
region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet bombers and missiles
crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in North America. After
the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington abandoned many of those
bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once again identifying "great
power competition" with Russia and China as the defining characteristic
of the present strategic environment, many of those bases are being
reoccupied and new ones established. Once again, the Arctic is being
viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia and, as a result, US
forces are being readied for possible combat there.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "Pompeo Doctrine," he indicated that the United
States was shifting from benign neglect of the region to aggressive
involvement and militarization. "We're entering a new age of strategic
engagement in the Arctic," he insisted, "complete with new threats to
the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in that
region." To better protect those interests against Russia's military
buildup there, "we are fortifying America's security and diplomatic
presence in the area...hosting military exercises, strengthening our
force presence, rebuilding our icebreaker fleet, expanding Coast Guard
funding, and creating a new senior military post for Arctic Affairs
inside of our own military."

The Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close
reading of the military press suggests that this activity has been
particularly focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin
with, the Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that
country, the first time foreign forces have been stationed there since
German troops occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330
Marines were initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017,
presumably to help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of US tanks
and combat vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was then
dispatched to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far closer to
the Russian border.

From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is the construction
of a US radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø about 40 miles
from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction with the
Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will evidently
be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines, assumedly in
order to target them and take them out in the earliest stages of any
conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is evident from the
mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018, sending 11 Su-24
supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island. (They turned
aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a surface-to-surface
missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.

In addition, in August 2018, the US Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond---from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational.

DECIPHERING COLD RESPONSE 2020

Exercise Cold Response 2020 must be viewed in the context of all these
developments. Few details about the thinking behind the upcoming war
games have been made public, but [it's not hard to imagine]{.underline}
what at least part of the scenario might be like: [a US-Russian
clash]{.underline} of some sort [leading to **[Russian attacks]{.mark}**
aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø and Norway's defense
headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern coast. The invading
troops [will be **slowed** ]{.mark}**but not stopped** [by Norwegian
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} (and those US Marines stationed in the
area), [[while]{.mark} thousands of reinforcements from NATO bases
elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.]{.underline}
**[Eventually]{.underline}**, of course, the tide will turn and [the
Russians will be forced back.]{.underline}

No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for Pentagon
planners the situation will go far beyond this. [Any Russian
assault]{.underline} on critical Norwegian military facilities would
presumably be preceded by intense air and missile bombardment and the
forward deployment of major naval vessels. [This]{.underline}, in turn,
[would prompt [**comparable moves** by]{.mark} the United States and
**[NATO]{.mark}**, probably **[result]{.mark}**ing [in]{.mark} violent
encounters and the **[loss of major assets]{.mark}** on all
sides[.]{.mark} In the process, [Russia's **key nuclear
retaliatory**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**forces** would be **at risk**
and]{.mark} quickly [placed on **high alert**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
senior officers operating in hair-trigger mode[[. Any misstep]{.mark}
might]{.underline} then [[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} what humanity has
feared since August 1945: a [**[nuclear apocalypse]{.mark} on Planet
Earth**.]{.underline}

There is no way to know to what degree such considerations are
incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the US Strategic Air Command, indicating that the American military
is keenly aware of the escalatory risks of any large-scale US-Russian
encounter in the Arctic.

In short, what might otherwise seem like a routine training exercise in
a distant part of the world is actually part of an emerging US strategy
to overpower Russia in a critical defensive zone, an approach that could
easily result in nuclear war. The Russians are, of course, well aware of
this and so will undoubtedly be watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine
trepidation. Their fears are understandable---but we should all be
concerned about a strategy that seemingly embodies such a high risk of
future escalation.

Ever since the Soviets acquired nuclear weapons of their own in 1949,
strategists have wondered how and where an all-out nuclear war---World
War III---would break out. At one time, that incendiary scenario was
believed most likely to involve a clash over the divided city of Berlin
or along the East-West border in Germany. After the Cold War, however,
fears of such a deadly encounter evaporated and few gave much thought to
such possibilities. Looking forward today, however, [the prospect of a
catastrophic World War III is again becoming **all too
imaginable**]{.underline} and this time, it appears, [an incident
in]{.underline} the **[[Arctic could]{.mark} prove the [spark]{.mark}
for [Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Anyone kept awake at night by **[climate change-fuelled [existential
crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** won't have welcomed the news that [a ship
has just sailed [through the Arctic]{.mark}'s Northern Sea Route without
an icebreaker]{.underline} -- the first time this has happened in
winter. And [[anyone kept awake by]{.mark} nightmares of [**nuclear
dystopia** won't be]{.mark}]{.underline} too
[[thrilled]{.underline}]{.mark} to learn that [[melting ice]{.mark} has
[stirred]{.mark} fears of **geopolitical fallout over [territorial
disputes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The ship which journeyed from South
Korea to Russia through the Northern Sea Route last month was a Russian
tanker carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG). And in August last year, a
Russian tanker sailed from Norway to South Korea without the help of a
specialised ice-breaking vessel, in two-thirds of the time it takes to
complete the regular route through the Suez Canal. Russia's President,
Vladimir [Putin, called this a "big event in the opening up of the
Arctic".]{.underline} Sailors have long sought an accessible route
through the Arctic between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Until
recently, ice has made crossings impossible. But as global warming
continues to melt Arctic ice at an unprecedented rate (temperatures here
are warming more than twice as fast as they are for the planet as a
whole), scientists have predicted that European shipping will be able to
reach Asia 10 days quicker by the middle of the century, set against
today's usual routes. All [[this **increases**]{.mark} **the potential
for [territorial ambitions]{.mark}** to become problematic]{.underline}.
A 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows each Arctic
state -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and
the US -- an economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from their
coastlines, in which they can explore and exploit resources. Countries
can apply to extend this zone if they believe their continental margin
extends further: this has already caused tension between states.
Denmark, for example, has claimed territory around Lomonosov Ridge
including the North Pole, which overlaps with large parts of Russia's
claim. The EU, and nine of the world's biggest fishing nations including
Canada, Russia, China, the US, Japan, Iceland, Denmark and South Korea,
signed a temporary agreement last year to prohibit fishing in the
central Arctic Ocean for 16 years in order to allow scientific research
to examine the area unhindered. But as it becomes more accessible,
[[Arctic states]{.mark} are]{.underline} now [[look]{.mark}ing [at how
they can exploit the area]{.mark}]{.underline} for natural resources.
Experts suggest that, at the current rate of ice decline, it will become
economically feasible to set up extraction operations by around 2040.
Chris Yesson, research fellow at the Institute of Zoology, says that,
while winter crossings will remain rare in the short term, the shipping
which does traverse the Arctic ocean will probably transport high-value
materials such as fuel. This could in turn cause more ice to break up,
as well as increasing noise pollution and raising the risk of oil and
gas spillage. "Greater access increases attention on the area; creating
well-established routes into the area makes it easier for other
commercial activities to move in," he says. However, Klauss Dodds,
professor of Geopolitics at Royal Holloway University, argues that
melting ice doesn't always equate to increased accessibility. "People
will increasingly be asking if the Northern Sea Route is more and more
more accessible, but it's a big 'if' because conditions are still very
unpredictable and difficult to manage. "It's far too simplistic to say
that the sea ice is retracting, and therefore access into the Arctic is
going to be easier. It's more complicated than that." [[Russia is at the
forefront]{.mark} of activity in the Arctic]{.underline}, and is said to
be rapidly expanding its influence. It has 46 icebreakers, according to
the US Coast Guard. Finland has the next highest total: seven. Arguably
this is proportionate to the size of Russia's territory in the Arctic,
but [concern is mounting at how [the potential]{.mark} for improved
access [might **raise geopolitical tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Dodds says that [even the Arctic simply appearing more accessible could
cause **problems**]{.underline}. And it is notable that the Northern Sea
Route is covered by Russia's exclusive economic zone.

Militarization -- the big elephant in the room

[The strong [militarization]{.mark} [in the Arctic is the elephant in

The geopolitical situation in the Arctic has worsened dramatically by
the Swedish and Finnish entry into NATO and the significant expansion of
the number of US bases in the Nordic countries. And not far from the
Norwegian border, Russia has its large military base on the Kola
Peninsula with nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons.

#### Arctic disputes [stay cold]{.underline}.

**Vlček 24**, (v-ll-check), PhD, Associate Professor, Department of
International Relations and European Studies, Faculty of Social Studies,

Analysis of Conflict Potential in the Arctic," Europe-Asia Studies, p.
8-11, DOI: 10.1080/09668136.2023.2292471)

In general, the legal regime of the Arctic is based on (fragmented)
international law and the domestic law of the Arctic-8 states (Drumbl &
Uhlířová 2021). These legal systems and specific rules intersect and
interact, making Arctic governance complex and multifaceted (Schönfeldt
2020). This is clear in the context of the 1920 Svalbard Treaty, which
recognises Norway's sovereignty over the archipelago while allowing
commercial activities (including mining or fishing) by other treaty
parties, based on the principle of non-discrimination of foreigners.
Despite this, Norway is not willing to treat citizens of other treaty
parties equally with regard to operations on the continental shelf
around Svalbard, as became evident in a dispute regarding fishing for
snow crab on the seabed. In this context, Norway claims exclusive rights
over the continental shelf surrounding Svalbard on the basis of UNCLOS,
which grants the coastal state the right to treat its own nationals
preferentially (Oystein 2020). Other states argue that Norway's
regulation of waters beyond its territorial sea should be subject to the
Svalbard Treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of
nationality in relation to certain activities, giving foreigners equal
rights to hunting, fishing and mining in Svalbard and its territorial
seas (Article 2 Svalbard Treaty). The rules of the UNCLOS and Svalbard
Treaty are thus perceived as contradictory. Fishing for snow crabs by
Latvia and other EU member states in this area has contributed to an
ongoing legal and diplomatic dispute between Norway, the EU and other
parties to the Svalbard Treaty7 on the status of waters surrounding
Svalbard and on fishing rights. These disputes culminated in
confrontational actions, such as Norway's 2017 detention of the Latvian
vessel Senator, which was operating on the Norwegian continental shelf
without a permit from the Norwegian authorities. Not willing to risk
straining the EU's bilateral relations with Norway, the European
Commission sought solutions based on dialogue and a constructive
approach, regardless of how much time this would take (European
Commission 2020, par. 53, 54). Recently, Russia has been increasing its
presence in Svalbard within the terms of the Svalbard Treaty (Nilsen
2021; McVicar 2022). [Despite tensions between Russia and Norway on
several issues]{.underline}, the chief of Norway's intelligence service
stated in 2022 that [Russia]{.underline} '**[acts]{.underline}** more
**[careful]{.underline}**\[**[ly]{.underline}**\],
\[[with]{.underline}\] self-**[restraint]{.underline}** here \[[in the
north]{.underline}\] [compared with]{.underline} what they do in [the
Baltic Sea]{.underline} and especially in contrast to the Black Sea ...
. It is our understanding that [[Russia wants **low tensions** and
**stability**]{.mark} in the north']{.underline} (Nilsen 2022).

Several other issues remain unsettled in the context of continental
shelf claims, by which Arctic states aim to extend their continental
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from coastal baselines. The largest
[disputes involve Russia, Denmark]{.underline} (by virtue of Greenland)
[and Canada]{.underline}. However, all [these [states have agreed to
follow]{.mark} the rules **laid down** in
**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which means that they have agreed to
submit scientific evidence to the UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (UN CLCS). Indeed, in 2021, Russia filed a submission
to the UN CLCS to extend its claim to the Arctic Ocean seabed, which
overlaps with those of Canada and Denmark. Russian claims currently
cover around 70% of the Arctic Ocean seabed (Breum 2021). In 2023, the
UN CLCS actually approved most of Russia's claim while Denmark and
Canada still have their claims unresolved (Hager 2023). While this move
could potentially increase tensions between Russia and other Arctic
states, as long as the process follows UNCLOS provisions the states
involved might be 'amenable to the expansion' (Kuras 2021). [[The only
dispute]{.mark} in the Arctic relating to land territory [involves Hans
Island]{.mark}, which remains a point of contention between Denmark and
Canada. Yet, the island is '**[little more than an irritant]{.mark}**'
in the relationship]{.underline} between the two countries (Olesen
2017). Although both states have acknowledged the idea of splitting Hans
Island, an agreement has yet to be reached.

In addition to the above examples of peaceful resolution of territorial
disputes and treaty observance, cooperative actions are further
supported by a 'complex network of institutionalised relations'
(Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011) and coalition-building. The soft-law regime of
the Arctic Council (AC) has been described as 'the most comprehensive
international body in the Arctic region' (Byers 2013). Institutionally,
the AC, International Maritime Organisation and Barents Euro-Arctic
Co-operation have an especially important role in resolving specific
issues. The Declaration on the Establishment of the Arctic Council of
1996 explicitly stated that it would promote cooperative activities
while not dealing with matters related to military security (Arctic
Council 1996). Global geopolitical issues and power competition were
therefore excluded in this leading inter-governmental forum even during
conflicts such as Russia's illegal use of force in Crimea in 2014, when
Russia de facto annexed Crimea and faced international sanctions (Byers
2017; Dodds & Woon 2020). However, Russian actions outside the Arctic
can affect relations with other Arctic states, a clear example being
Russia's 2022 military aggression against Ukraine, which has
'substantially affected' Russian relations with Norway, the US and
Canada, and introduced elements of heightened competition and tension
into the Arctic's geopolitical environment.8 There have been various
treaty-like cooperative initiatives, such as the 2018 US--Russia scheme
for managing two-way shipping traffic through the Bering Sea and the
2020 US and Russia Joint Contingency Plan for combating maritime
pollution.9 Nonetheless, increased tensions and competition are
apparent, for example, due to the NATO exercises Trident Juncture 18,
held in 2018, and Cold Response, held in 2022, with a total of about
30,000 soldiers, marines and airmen from 27 countries participating
(NATO 2022a).

In the last decade, the AC has become 'the focal point for
treaty-making' in the Arctic (Koivurova 2014). In 2011, the AC members
adopted a search-and-rescue treaty (Arctic Council 2011a) as a first
legally binding instrument under the auspices of the AC (Byers 2017). A
second binding instrument on cooperation on marine-oil pollution
preparedness and response was signed at the Kiruna Ministerial Meeting
in 2013 (Arctic Council 2013), while a third legally binding agreement,
negotiated under the auspices of the AC and signed in 2017, aimed to
enhance international Arctic scientific cooperation (Arctic Council
2017). All AC observers10 affirm (Arctic Council 2011b, p. 50) the
primacy of the Arctic-8 states' sovereignty and jurisdiction in the
Arctic (Rainwater 2015). Lastly, the 2013 admission of China as an
observer in the AC means that all five UN Security Council permanent
members are now either members or observers of the AC (Charron 2014).

Despite their divergent interests, the Arctic-8 countries are united in
their resistance to any attempts by non-Arctic countries (such as
Germany or France) to interfere with their division of the Arctic
(Olesen 2017), as also illustrated by the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008,
a joint regional effort in response to the effects of climate change.
The Ilulissat Declaration was brought by the coastal states of the
Arctic Ocean (the United States, the Russian Federation, Canada, Norway
and Denmark), which claim to be in 'a unique position to address these
possibilities and challenges' (2008 Ilulissat Declaration).

[Even with regard to unresolved claims, [the tendency is to **engage in

[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[submit]{.mark} these [claims

**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the UN CLCS. The

(including offshore energy) [[are located in **uncontested

which may at times be coloured by competition among some Arctic states

In conclusion, the evidence shows that [the Arctic-8]{.underline}
continue to [behave]{.underline} mostly [in a cooperative manner,
without increasing rivalry]{.underline}. While this trend did not change
after the illegal annexation of Crimea, since Russia's invasion of

#### Russia is a massive deficit -- no funding and it kills the council regardless of the CP

**Last 5-11 -- CBC Arctic Reporter** (John Last, 5-11-2023, \"Future of
Arctic Council in doubt after end of Russian chairship\", CBC,
https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/arctic-council-handover-russia-1.6836000)

[Russia\'s two-year term as chair of the Arctic Council came to an end
Thursday, leaving the future of the council\'s role as a forum for
international collaboration in doubt.]{.underline}

In a low-key virtual ceremony attended by senior bureaucrats, Russia
ceded the chair to Norway, which will lead the council for the next two
years.

The style of the ceremony marked a shift for the council. The transfer
of the chair is an opportunity for grand declarations and photo ops, as
the foreign ministers of the eight Arctic countries mingle with
Indigenous representatives and powerhouse observers like China and
Japan.

It\'s obvious what has changed --- one year into its chairship, Russia
went from problematic partner to international pariah with its 2022
invasion of Ukraine.

\"The idea of sitting with the Russians and talking about economic
development while they\'re bombing Kyiv --- it just doesn\'t work,\"
said Evan Bloom, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Wilson
Center\'s Polar Institute and a former diplomat who helped establish the
Arctic Council in 1996.

Since March 2022, the seven other Arctic states --- Finland, Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Canada and the United States --- have
suspended their co-operation with Russia, bringing a sudden stop to the
majority of the work of the Arctic Council.

[Arctic peers warn \'no return\' to pre-war times as Russia frozen from
circumpolar talks]{.underline}

[Though some projects have since resumed without Russia, the future of
the council\'s work is in doubt. How can the Arctic Council continue
when, in the words of the incoming chair, co-operation with Moscow is
\"politically impossible\"?]{.underline}

\"Right now, it leaves the concept somewhat in tatters,\" said Bloom**[.
\"Russia makes up about half the Arctic. You can\'t really have an
Arctic Council without Russia.\"]{.underline}**

A council above politics

The Arctic Council was formed amid a climate of optimism that followed
the end of the Cold War.

Founded in 1996, the Council brings together the eight Arctic states
with six Indigenous groups and dozens of observers to work in the spirit
of consensus on issues facing the Arctic.

Despite the Arctic\'s role as a Cold War theatre, from its beginnings,
the council\'s guiding documents prohibited any discussion of military
security, which risked driving a rift between the Arctic nations.

\"It was understood that if a body like this touched security issues...
it would not go very well,\" said Bloom.

That allowed the council to focus on other, more pressing Arctic
concerns, like climate change, fisheries, sustainable development and
Indigenous representation.

Over the next two decades, this helped give rise to an idea of \"Arctic
exceptionalism\" --- that the region was an arena for benevolent
co-operation, immune to the geopolitical struggles occurring in the rest
of the world.

[But as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, \"any dream of
full-on Arctic exceptionalism... was over,\" according to Whitney
Lackenbauer, a Canada Research chair in the study of the Canadian North
at Trent University in Peterborough, Ont.]{.underline}

\"In essence, what we\'re now seeing is that the Arctic, as a
circumpolar region, is not isolated from geopolitics.\"

New alliances

This has been further driven home by Sweden and Finland\'s moves to join
NATO, which would bring all seven Arctic nations besides Russia inside
the Western security alliance.

\"It\'s such a stark change of reality,\" said Timo Koivurova, a
research professor at the University of Lapland\'s Arctic Centre and a
frequent contributor to Arctic Council working groups.

Canada looks to reinforce Arctic sovereignty through diplomacy,
military, says minister

Canada pulls out of upcoming Arctic Council meeting in Russia

Finland, he says, has been working closely on Arctic issues with their
neighbour since the Second World War.

\"Many of these projects are now seen as ... too friendly to Russia,\"
he said.

During a visit to Nunavut\'s Cambridge Bay with NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the importance
of defence in Canada\'s Far North amid Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.

That wariness is shared on both sides of the border.

[\"How can we ... even if the Arctic Council resumes its work ... build
co-operation on a long-term basis?\" Nikolay Korchunov, Russia\'s Arctic
ambassador, told the Russian news agency TASS.]{.underline}

\"The most important element is lost --- the trust is lost.\"

[That lack of trust has led to fears that the Arctic Council could
devolve into an \"Arctic 7,\" an alliance of like-minded Western nations
that formerly breaks with Russia --- and divides the Arctic territory,
literally, in half.]{.underline}

From May 2021 to May 2023, Russia assumed the chairship of the Arctic
Council for the second time. As chair, it was expected to lead the
collective efforts of the primary regional forum comprised of the eight
Arctic nations, six Permanent Participants representing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples, six working groups, and thirty-nine observer states,
intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations.
This represented a critical opportunity for Russia to focus
international attention on the importance of the Arctic through its
distinct lens.1 "Despite the fact that seven other AC member-states
belong to Western institutions that do not include Russia (NATO, EU,
Nordic organizations), Moscow feels itself comfortable in the Council
because it functions there on the equal footing and it is able to
partake in the AC decision-making," Russian international relations
scholar Alexander Sergunin astutely noted in anticipation of Russia
assuming the chairship. This elevated "the Council\'s role to the
highest priority of Moscow's Arctic strategy in the near- and midterm
future."2 [Arctic priorities]{.underline}, however, [were subordinated
to Russia's revisionist designs seeking to restructure the global order
through military aggression and blatant violation of international
law]{.underline}. Consequently, [Russia's decision to further invade
Ukraine ensured that its Arctic Council chairship would be a dramatic
failure]{.underline}. On 3 March 2022, [the **[like-minded Arctic
states]{.mark}** of Canada, Finland, Iceland, Kingdom of Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States [released a **joint
statement**]{.mark} [announcing a **"pause" of** ]{.mark}**Arctic
[Council]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "pending
consideration of the necessary modalities that can allow us to continue
the Council's important work in view of the current circumstances." That
June, [the seven countries]{.underline} released a joint statement
announcing their intention to "[implement a limited resumption of our
work in the Arctic Council on projects that do not involve the
participation of the Russian Federation]{.underline}." The statement
explained that "these projects, contained in the work plan approved by
all 8 Arctic states at the Reykjavik ministerial, are a vital component
of our responsibility to the peoples of the Arctic, including Indigenous
peoples." The states would "continue to examine additional modalities to
allow us to further continue the council's important work."3 With Russia
effectively prevented from running a consensus-based circumpolar
organization without the participation of the seven other Arctic states,
it chose to narrow its Arctic Council agenda to focus on domestic Arctic
development and conducted scheduled events without Western
participation.4 (Of course, none of this required a circumpolar forum to
do.) [Official statements from the [Russia]{.mark}n **Ministry of
Foreign Affairs**]{.underline} (MFA) [[indicated a desire to **resume

"The Arctic Council is and should remain the key international forum of

Senior Arctic Officials chair, Nikolay Korchunov, emphasized in late May
2022. "[[The future]{.mark} of the Council [will depend]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the Arctic countries' [spirit of
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and commitment to collective approaches
and solutions. We confirm that this work should be resumed in full as
soon as possible. This would be in the interest of all the Arctic states
and the welfare of Arctic inhabitants and indigenous people."5 [[With

#### The Arctic Council structurally cannot do anything even with the counterplan

**Gross 22 - Senior editor and copy editor for the Harvard International
Review** (Matthew Gross, 02-16-2022, \"The Influence of the Arctic
Council\", Harvard International Review,
https://hir.harvard.edu/the-influence-of-the-arctic-council/)

As the potential for geopolitical conflict in the Arctic Circle heats
up, the role of the Arctic Council---the multinational organization that
oversees the region---as a possible forum for tempering down looming
threats has been undermined by the Council's structure. The United
States, China, and Russia are the main geopolitical competitors in a
strife over available territory in the Arctic and the accompanying
natural resources that lie in the region. The Arctic Council has eight
member nations and 14 observer nations, as well as a rotating
Chairmanship of the Arctic Circle that changes every two years. 2021
marked the start of Russia's two-year tenure at the rotating helm of the
council. While Russia has promised to protect environmental interests
and to strengthen the powers of the Arctic Council, Russia's willingness
and ability to achieve these goals remain dubious. Any resolution made
by the Arctic Council is not binding, placing limitations on the
organization's efficiency. For example, Russia has been advancing its
economic interests in the region, which mainly consist of oil drilling.
However, this behavior contradicts the Kremlin's stated goal of
protecting environmental interests in the region. The question for the
Arctic Council over the next two years is: can it maintain its status as
an organization that upholds peace and environmental health in the
Arctic region, while also remaining a non-binding organization that
deals primarily in rhetoric?

Russia's economic interests in the region put it on a strong collision
course with China and the United States. Mining in the Arctic Circle has
become an area of competition due to the finite resources and space upon
which to mine. Ambiguity caused by competing Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) claims means that territorial jurisdiction is often unclear.
Moreover, melting polar ice caps means that territory that was
previously inaccessible is now available for countries, such as the US,
China, and Russia, to claim. Consequently, this has led to a
back-and-forth competition between major economic powers to claim as
much territory as possible, as the application of existing EEZs to newly
created territory lacks precedent and clarity.

The Arctic Council could play a significant role in determining which
countries end up with successful outcomes and which countries fall short
of their regional goals. Specifically, this might come in the form of
resolutions that countries would have an incentive to abide by. Absent
the Arctic Council making a determination that countries adhere to, the
potential for armed conflict over territory in the region could
increase. The implication is that the legitimacy of the Arctic Council
must be recognized by its three major powers---the United States, China,
and Russia---as well as the other competing nations in the region in
order to avoid conflict. A Russian-led Arctic Council risks the
legitimacy of the Arctic Council by creating the perception that its
rulings are designed to advance Russian interests rather than
mutually-beneficial regional goals. The creation of the rotating
Chairmanship was an attempt to bolster the Council's legitimacy by
maintaining the perception of neutral and fair procedures, but this
facet of the Council fails to account for the conflict of interest
between Chairmanship duties and self-interest that might arise on the
part of the Chairmanship nation.

While military activity in the Arctic region has been historically
limited, it remains unclear what the Arctic Council's role would be in
preventing further escalation and de-escalation if nations decide to
engage in the region militarily. The Arctic Council maintains a unique
role in international relations, since other existing multilateral
organizations that could potentially have jurisdiction over the region
lack the specificity and expertise to govern territory disputes. NATO,
for example, does not include Russia or China as members, while existing
international agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) lack proper protocols to address the Arctic
Circle situation. This means that it falls within the Arctic Council's
responsibility to ensure that there is no military conflict in the
region. As with economic issues, Russia's role as the Chairmanship of
the Arctic Council could sow doubts about the Council's rulings as
biased in favor of Putin's national objectives.

Beyond Russia's Chairmanship, there are structural issues within the
Arctic Council that could make conflict resolution difficult. One of
these is the hierarchical status within the organization that includes
both member and observer nations. These differences in status mean that
it is difficult for every nations' interests to have significant
influence over the Council and its resolutions. Since China is an
observer nation rather than a member nation, it could be easy to
conceive of a scenario where they ignore an Arctic Council ruling and
ramp up their military activity in the region. Similarly, both the
current status of Russia as the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council and
the structural issue of the nations' hierarchy could make it difficult
for the Arctic Council to properly exercise its role as a deterrent to
military conflict. At the moment, these concerns remain largely
theoretical, but the Arctic Council and any interested nations must
remain vigilant should nations decide to increase their military
presence.

The Arctic is an important region to watch over the coming years due to
polar ice caps melting and the potential for countries to claim more
land. While the problems that lie ahead are apparent, the solutions are
less obvious. It is possible that the Arctic Council, even with its
flaws, could be the organization that can create peace in the regions by
negotiating compromises and agreements that satisfy all of the major
parties. In order for this to happen, the Arctic Council needs to prove
its strength through demonstrating that it is an impartial organization
with legitimate jurisdiction to govern the region through decreasing the
global perception of self-interested declarations, and ensuring that
every interested nation is included in the decision-making process.

Media [reports continue to draw **linear relationships** between the
availability of **food** and **conflict**]{.underline}. In recent years,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} global [decline of wild fish stocks has given
rise to [claim]{.mark}s [that **conflict over fish**]{.mark}
**resources** [is likely]{.mark} to occur in the near
future]{.underline}. Recent reports suggest that inter-state conflict
will break out due to a decline in global fish stocks, while others
suggest that 'the world is already at war over fish'. [That commentary
draws on the notion of **resource wars**]{.underline}, which suggests
that states often enter into conflict for control of resources, such as
oil, gas or precious minerals. The commentators suggest that since fish
stocks are declining, it is only a matter of time before the supply of
fish also becomes an increasingly valuable resource worth going to war
over. [That notion [is **overly simplistic**]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, [and]{.underline} obscures, or **[ignores]{.underline}**, [the
**many other reasons** that prompt states to engage in
conflict.]{.underline}

While the International Food Policy Research Institute maintains that
'food insecurity can be both a cause and consequence of conflict', the
debate about food insecurity causing conflict continues unabated. Other
research suggests that [[food insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}, on its
own, [[does not]{.mark} **automatically [lead]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a
**heightened risk of [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Other factors,
such as the strength of]{.underline} political
**[institutions]{.underline}**, also [play a **decisive role** in
whether conflict occurs]{.underline}. [A review of the **linkages**
between **food security and conflict**]{.underline}, [concludes that [it
is **difficult to**]{.mark} **[isolate]{.mark}** the **[particular
factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} that contribute to the outbreak of
conflict. It suggests that 'more and better data on and from conflict
zones is required for understanding and monitoring the full diversity,
nature and interrelations of food security and violent conflict'.

[**China** is]{.underline} often [cited]{.underline} [as the **most
likely belligerent** in any so-called "**fish war**".]{.underline} Some
strategic analysts argue that China sees wild fish as 'a strategic
commodity to be protected and defended, if necessary, by force'; [they
point to the [**militarisation** of the **E**]{.mark}]{.underline}ast
[[and **S**]{.underline}]{.mark}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**eas as evidence[. An increased Chinese
military presence in those regions [is not]{.mark} likely [to be]{.mark}
**solely** [due to]{.mark} the **presence of
[fish]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, and [[securing]{.mark}
**strategic maritime [trade routes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.mark}
likely to be [a]{.mark}]{.underline}n equal, if not
**[[greater]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[motivating
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While [[Beijing]{.mark} has often
utilised fishing vessels to further **geostrategic aims**, it [is
**unlikely** to use military force **just to gain**]{.mark} [**access**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} foreign **[[fish]{.mark}ing
grounds]{.underline}**.

Chinese fishing vessels have been found as far afield as Argentina,
Ecuador and South Africa. Each of those countries has raised concerns
with Beijing about its fishing fleet encroaching on their exclusive
economic zones (EEZ). Since 2014, [Indonesia has destroyed several
Chinese fishing vessels]{.underline}, among hundreds of others, mainly
from South-East Asian countries. [Food security is **not the primary
motive**]{.underline} [for these actions]{.underline} however, [as
**sovereignty** and the potential economic loss from increased
**competition**]{.underline} for fish in EEZs, [play a **larger role**
in any such "conflict".]{.underline} In the Indonesian case, [the
**destruction** of foreign fishing vessels is designed more to deter
illegal fishing that **deprives the state of revenue** and]{.underline}
[to **boost popular support** for the **fisheries
minister**,]{.underline} [than]{.underline} to ensure **[food
security]{.underline}**.

As declining global fish stocks drive fishing vessels into the exclusive
economic zones of other states, the risk of misunderstandings increases.
States that feel that their sovereignty is being challenged could
retaliate with force, potentially escalating disputes between fishing
vessels into armed conflict. Given [that [states]{.mark} continue to
**[uphold]{.mark}** the **international norm of state
[sovereignty]{.mark}** [and are **only** likely to violate it in]{.mark}
**particularly [exceptional circumstances]{.mark}**[, it is **difficult
to imagine** a scenario where **fishing disputes**]{.mark} in EEZs
[escalate]{.mark} to **inter-state conflict.**]{.underline}

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a major global problem,
which is contributing to the decline of global fish stocks. At a time
when global demand for protein is rising, it could contribute to a
global decline in food security. [It is a **step too far**, however, to
suggest that the scarcity of fish will inevitably lead to **armed
conflict**]{.underline} or naval confrontation between states.
[**Exaggerated statements** about looming fish wars could potentially
encourage the further **militarisation** of fishing fleets]{.underline}.
[That would only **heighten** the]{.underline} -- admittedly still
unlikely -- [chance of **interstate conflict** over **fish
resources**]{.underline}.

### Deficit\-\--Structural Barriers\-\--1AR

#### The Arctic Council lacks the capacity to be an effective governing body

[Nord 17 - visiting professor of political science at Umea University in
Sweden and a contributing member of its Arctic Research
Centr]{.underline}e (Douglas C. Nord, 2017, \"The Challenge of Arctic
Governance\", Wilson Quarterly,
https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/into-the-arctic/the-challenge-of-arctic-governance)

[The Arctic Council's answer to how it can govern stems precisely from
recognition of this fact. At present, there appears to be little
interest in creating a broad array of regional agreements and
regulations that might guide the conduct of the Arctic states or
residents]{.underline}. Additionally, as an intergovernmental forum
rather than an empowered international organization, [the Arctic Council
lacks the full capacity to enact any resulting measures. As far as
funding is concerned, it is already a challenge to secure financial
contributions from individual states for agreed-upon Council
initiatives.]{.underline}

[Given these circumstances, the Council has generally remained within
the more limited scope of seeking to promote greater local and global
awareness of northern concerns. These include the rapid rise in Arctic
temperatures, the melting of polar seas, and the challenges of
developing natural resources in fragile ecosystems]{.underline}. In some
instances, other venues and frameworks -- such as the UN Environment
Programme, the Polar Code, and the Law of the Sea -- are deemed more
appropriate for addressing Arctic concerns. In other cases, the Arctic
Council has been able to sponsor international agreements that address
more limited, regional concerns, such as conventions on Arctic search
and rescue and oil pollution preparedness and response.

Why? It's the most existential question for many governance bodies. The
[limits of its capacity to act notwithstanding, the Arctic
Council]{.underline} has offered multiple answers. At times, it has
cited the conditions faced by the lands and peoples of the region and
the need to share information, insights, and best practices. At other
times, it has pointed to the dramatic changes on the Arctic horizon,
brought about by climate change, globalization, and "the race for
resources". The need to integrate a distinctly Arctic perspective into
broader global discussions and negotiations has also been claimed as a
raison d\'être.

### Deficit\-\--Russia\-\--1AR

#### No Russia -- No Solvency

**Simpson 23 - Fulbright Fellow based in Berlin,** Germany (Brett
Simpson, 5-31-2023, \"The Rise and Sudden Fall of the Arctic Council\",
Foreign Policy, https://archive.is/kQ2BA)

On May 11, 2023, in a much-anticipated ceremony, leaders from eight
Arctic states and six Indigenous organizations assembled behind closed
doors to witness a transfer of power. At first blush, it was routine
Arctic Council business: this forum promoting northern cooperation
rotates chairmanship every two years. But this had been no ordinary
year, with no ordinary chair. The council---suspended since Russia's
invasion of Ukraine last year---resurrected only to witness Russia hand
the chairmanship to its Norwegian successor. And a peaceful transfer was
far from a foregone conclusion.

"It was an extremely straightforward meeting, which we see as a
success," said Morten Hoglund, senior Arctic official for Norway, in a
virtual press briefing from Tromso directly following the meeting. "If
someone had an interest in it not going as planned, they could have
easily derailed it."

That "someone," of course, would have been Russia. Since the Arctic
Council's unilateral refusal to cooperate with its largest geographical
member last March, Russia has shown no sign of de-escalating its
aggression against Ukraine. And the council's 130-odd circumpolar
projects---tackling issues from science, to shipping, to Indigenous
youth suicide---have paid the price. For more than a year, this symbol
of High North peace has fractured along territorial lines, awaiting a
return to a status quo that seems increasingly impossible.

Today, with a NATO state back at its helm, the Arctic Council will
presumably experience less tension. But it's still unwilling to include
Russia, raising practical questions about what this forum can actually
achieve without its largest geographical stakeholder. Russia makes up 45
percent of the geographical Arctic; shipping routes depend on its
waters, and climate research depends on its data. Norway is now facing
hard questions about the relevance of a "circumpolar" forum that ignores
half of the High North.

"Technically speaking, there's no 'Arctic Council' without Russia," said
Svein Vigeland Rottem, senior research fellow at the Norwegian Fridtjof
Nansen Institute and author of the 2020 book The Arctic Council: Between
Environmental Protection and Geopolitics. "So one could ask: What,
exactly, is this group now?"

The Arctic Council, founded in 1996 in a post-Cold War vision of High
North peace, has no real global equivalent. Along with representatives
from eight foreign ministries, it's the only international group that
includes Indigenous leaders as equal stakeholders. (The council's 13
observer states, made up of interested non-Arctic nations, attend but do
not participate in meetings.) And, because its work is voluntary and not
treaty-based, these leaders have flexibility to independently approve or
invest in its projects.

"It's a completely unique group formed around a specific set of
challenges," said Lars-Otto Reiersen, who served as executive secretary
of the council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) for 25
years. "Most leaders of Arctic states don't reside there. And most
problems in the north can't be solved there, either."

Pollution was the first such problem to raise global attention. In 1991,
Finland launched AMAP, then a postwar project to monitor contamination
throughout the far north. The findings were startling: The blood of
Arctic species and peoples contained the planet's highest concentration
of persistent organic chemicals---the vast majority of which came from
industry farther south. The cold Northern regions acted as a "sink" for
these global pollutants, they found, and toxic chemicals were building
up, or bioaccumulating, in the blood of polar species foundational to
Indigenous diets. AMAP recognized a twofold challenge: to both establish
a dialogue on the ground with Arctic communities, and at the highest
levels to influence international law. Over the next decade, its data,
coupled with policy recommendations, helped build the legally binding
2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

"It was a success story of combining data you can't question with real
actions for policymakers to take," Reiersen said. "And it was an early
model of close collaboration between scientists and Indigenous people."

In 1996, the Arctic Council formed in the spirit of this work: to
protect the environment and peoples of the north. Since, its six
expert-led working groups---including monitoring, clean-up,
conservation, oceans, peoples, search and rescue, and sustainable
development---have worked in the background to influence international
law. Data published in its 2009 Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment
directly informed the International Maritime Organization's regulatory
Polar Code. An AMAP report on mercury contamination fueled the 2013
Minamata Convention regulating mercury. Since 2005, AMAP---now a network
of more than 700 experts---has also contributed the entire Arctic
section of the annual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.

In March 2022, however, this vast network of science, policy, and
diplomacy came to a screeching halt. For some projects, the pause was
brief: By June, some projects without direct Russian involvement quietly
resumed their work. The Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat, which supports
the six Indigenous organizations independently of the council, also
continued to operate. But for climate science and environmental
monitoring projects---which rely on consistent data collection across
borders---it was a massive blow.

Arctic Harmony Is Falling Apart

An isolated Russia is turning to China for help in the north.

Argument \| Elisabeth Braw

"There's a huge amount of data we aren't getting anymore," Reiersen
said. "Plus Russian data we know isn't being collected, because these
projects were funded by Western states."

But since its research-rooted origins, the Arctic Council has taken on a
new role: a diplomatic stage in an increasingly competitive global
arena. In the past decade, the Arctic's melts have newly opened the
region for shipping, resource extraction, and other economic
opportunities. Ever since, Reiersen said, interest in the council and
its activities has soared. In 2013, in recognition of growing interests
in the north, the council added six new observer states: China, Japan,
India, Italy, Singapore, and South Korea. In 2013, the council
established an independent secretariat in Tromso to archive knowledge
and facilitate its work. In 2018 and 2022, the council was nominated for
the Nobel Peace Prize.

"There was a time when a lot of people were raising this one
organization up as the primary body for Arctic cooperation," said
Andreas Osthagen, senior fellow at the Arctic Institute. "But it gets
tricky the moment that all falls apart."

Osthagen is critical of what he sees as an outsized symbolic weight
placed on the Arctic Council. In truth, he says, this forum is only one
piece of a vast picture of High North governance. Legally binding
agreements, most notably the 1994 Law of the Sea Convention, he notes,
do much more to guide and regulate Arctic activity. And several other
treaties and forums---like the Polar Code governing shipping, the Arctic
Fisheries Agreement, the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, and countless
bilateral agreements---still provide issue-specific opportunities for
cooperation. Similarly, Osthagen said, the "real value" of the council
was not as a diplomatic stage, but in the practical achievements of its
working groups and their projects.

Soon, even those projects without Russian participation are headed for a
roadblock. The Arctic Council is a consensus-based forum, and its
projects require full-member approval. But project funding typically
only spans a few years at most. Unless the council changes its
decision-making requirements, or decides to include Russia, the runway
for this work is limited.

Russia may not wait around to be invited back to the table. In February,
Russia amended its Arctic policy, removing all mention of the Arctic
Council. For the past year, Russia has strengthened its Arctic
cooperation with China, including a proposed new research station on
Svalbard with BRICS nations. And, with Sweden likely soon to follow
Finland's recent NATO inclusion, the newly termed "Arctic 7" seem all
the more distanced from their estranged eighth.

Still, by cooperating in the May 11 meeting, Russia signaled at least
some investment in the council's survival. And it took what Hoglund
called a "powerful step forward": After the meeting, the council
released a joint declaration signed by all members, including Russian
senior Arctic official Nikolay Korchunov.

"We wanted to give the message that the Arctic Council is not dead, it's
still here, and we want to make it relevant again," Hoglund said.

A declaration of life seems all the council can currently muster. Volker
Rachold, director of the German Arctic Office, called this year's joint
declaration "highly unusual." Typically, after the standard affirmation
of the council's purpose, the declaration outlines goals and new
projects for the next two years. This year, he said, the statement was
notably sparse.

"After the usual opening remarks, it just seemed to stop," Rachold said.
"I thought I was missing pages."

Rottem believes that, for now, Norway has a lot to gain from staying
vague. Any fanfare or strong statement, he said, threatens a more formal
fracture. Starting new projects would force hard questions about how to
treat the consensus vote. But the small Nordic nation, which shares a
land border with Russia, is well-practiced in walking a fine diplomatic
line with its neighbor. For now, by moving slowly and staying light on
details, it may just keep the past 30 years of work afloat.

In June, Arctic Council leaders will meet again---this time without
Russia---to discuss a potential path forward. Hoglund said that he hopes
to have a sense of next steps by the end of the summer, but it's no hard
deadline. Generally, he said, those eager to see the work of the Arctic
Council resume at full strength will be disappointed.

"We're not here ringing a bell to say we're back; we're focused on
taking it step by step," Hoglund said. "If cooperation breaks down
completely, it will be so much harder to rebuild it from scratch."

#### It's impossible -- the AC is fully dead

**Jonassen 24 -- Editor in Chief at the High North News** (Trine
Jonassen, 2-1-2024, \""Without Russia, the Arctic Council Will Not
Survive"\", High North News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/without-russia-arctic-council-will-not-survive)

"It is easy to argue that the survival of the Arctic Council is in
danger. However, it is still functioning partly," says researcher Svein
Vigeland Rottem at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute during a panel debate
at the Arctic Frontier conference in Tromsø, Northern Norway.

Since February 2022, the future of the Arctic Council has been under
great international scrutiny.

The cooled relations between Russia and the West have affected the
Council greatly since the 7 Western Arctic states paused all official
work within the Council until Norway took over leadership of the Council
last May.

The main arena

If the Arctic Council fails to survive the crisis of having one of its
members at war, the web of carefully built-up networks might collapse,
which cannot be rebuilt overnight.

"I heard someone say that it can be rebuilt in another fashion, but one
cannot imagine how long it takes for an organization to build up
credibility and the power necessary for it to be heard," Rottem states.

We are not the Arctic 7. We are 8.

SAO Solveig Rossebø

The Arctic Council is highlighted by all Arctic states as the main arena
for cooperation in the Arctic.

Not 7, but 8

But will the Council survive this crisis? And is it politicly and
morally possible for the West to continue to cooperate with Russia?

Solveig Rossebø is the new Senior Arctic Official (SAO) for Norway in
the Arctic Council, as the former SAO Morten Høglund, now is chair
during the Norwegian leadership. She makes it clear during the debate,
that membership in the Arctic Council is not decided by election, but by
geography.

"We are not the Arctic 7. We are 8. We are the Arctic".

At war

It is however, challenging to have one of the members invading another
country.

withdraws. (Archive photo: Trine Jonassen)

\"From Norway\'s perspective, the Arctic Council is still special as a
cooperation between the eight and indigenous organizations.\"

The indigenous peoples are distributed differently than the states,
across borders, and hold a unique position at the Council table.

Long term

Rossebø assures that the Arctic Council is alive and continues to
develop.

\"We need multilateral cooperation to combat climate change. To get the
full picture, we need circumpolar data, and not only from half the
region. The Norwegian perspective is long-term,\" says the Norwegian
SAO.

The survival of the Council might be even more significant as the Arctic
has already seen two Northern organizations change format: the Barents
Council and the Council of the Baltic Sea States.

About the Arctic Council

The Arctic Council is the leading intergovernmental forum promoting
cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States,
Arctic Indigenous Peoples and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic
issues, in particular on issues of sustainable development and
environmental protection in the Arctic. It was formally established in
1996.

All Arctic Council decisions and statements require consensus of the
eight Arctic States.

Risk losing it

Rossebø agrees with Rottem that it will be difficult to reestablish the
Council should it be lost. Not all change is good change.

"To revalue the cooperation too much is to risk losing it. Since we took
over the chair, we have been working to resume the work that was put on
pause after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This has been challenging and
difficult. We still have not reached our goals, but the cooperation
cannot be as it used to be. We must compromise and lower the pace.
Still, we are working to increase the activity," the SAO explains.

The Arctic Council must continue to deliver results to remain relevant,
and the Norwegian chairship is working to find solutions that work for
all eight states.

"The most important thing for the Norwegian chairship is to ensure that
the Arctic Council as a whole with all its eight members remains the
most important bilateral forum for Arctic cooperation," Rossebø states.

Call for transparency

Going forward, the challenge is to find ways to make the working groups
from all eight countries work together in a way that is acceptable to
all eight states.

Bidens Arctic Advisor: \"Our Postures in The Arctic Have Changed\"

\"We are using all our creativity and fantasy, and we are discussing it
with the working groups. But all eight countries agree that we must keep
the Arctic Council as the premier forum for Arctic cooperation.\"

Malgorzata Smieszek, a Researcher at UiT - The Arctic University of
Norway - took the opportunity to call for greater transparency during
the crisis.

\"After the war, most Arctic Council observers did not know what was
happening; their regular communication channels were broken. And even
now, it is at times difficult to know what is happening in the
Council,\" says Smieszek.

Little information

The UIT researcher thinks that more openness could also serve the Arctic
Council in terms of reconfirming its position.

\"Otherwise, one might think that there is not so much happening in the
Council.\"

The Arctic Council in the form we know it will die if Russia leaves the
Council

Fridtjof Nansen Institue Researcher Svein Vigeland Rottem

Rossebø nods in recognition. The leadership received many similar
comments from observer states. She says she understands that the first
year after Norway\'s takeover from Russia was difficult with little
information.

\"The observers used to participate in the formal meetings, and now
there were no more of those. The challenge for the Norwegian chairship
is that we are in a process, so we do not know either what will happen.
We are working with the other members and the indigenous peoples to find
out how to do this. We have not reached our goal yet. But we are open to
having more meetings with the observers,\" the SAO reassures.

The fact that the 8 Arctic states must agree on everything -- Russia
included - is a balancing act.

Regularly Russian contact

Rossebø informs that they are, in fact, in touch with their Russian
counterparts regularly.

\"As the chair of the Arctic Council, we have discussions with all the
members, including Russia. We have discussions with our Russian
colleagues regularly.\"

Going into the Norwegian chairship in May last year, there was
discussion about whether Russia would sabotage the council or use it for
its own propaganda. So far, that has not happened, according to Solveig
Rossebø.

In fact, she says that Russia has been "very constructive in Arctic
cooperation as it has always been."

"Russia wants to stay a member of the Arctic Council, and that is why
they also cooperate."

Dead letters

"What would happen if Russia decided to leave the Arctic Council?"

Researcher Svein Vigeland Rottem is in no doubt.

"The Arctic Council in the form we know it will die if Russia leaves the
Council," Rottem says in a comment to High North News.

"But I do not think Russia will withdraw from the Arctic Council, even
if they send mixed signals sometimes. It is not in their interest", says
the Arctic Council expert.

Half of the Arctic

\"I think the working groups would still be alive and kicking. But we
must acknowledge that half of the Arctic is Russian, and the Arctic
Council is a product of the end of the Cold War and is all about
circumpolar cooperation. So, if that happens, the Arctic Council will be
dead letters\".

\"Or it becomes something else, like the Barents cooperation, which has
become a Nordic cooperation now without Russia,\" suggests Solveig
Rossebø.

But a great loss it would be still, so the Norwegian chairship is hard
at work to keep all eight states in the Council.

Even if the Arctic Council were to evaporate, the Arctic issues would
not go away and would still have to be solved.

\"The Arctic cooperation would not be dead even if the Arctic Council
would be,\" Rottem states.
