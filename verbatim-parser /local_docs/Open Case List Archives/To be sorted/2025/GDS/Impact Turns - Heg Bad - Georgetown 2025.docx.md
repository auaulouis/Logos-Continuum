Core Restraint Views A Restraint approach to U.S.--China relations is
founded upon and reflects several overall views and assumptions
regarding both vital American national interests and policies and
several key features of the international system. One core Restraint set
of views is that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} unnecessarily
[[**over-extended** in]{.mark} its **[military involvement]{.mark}**
across the globe]{.underline}, has an excessively broad definition of
its vital interests, [[and too frequently relies on
**military**]{.underline}]{.mark} over diplomatic
**[[means]{.underline}]{.mark}** to defend those interests while seeking
to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, economic and military
dominance worldwide and to extend democracy to as many nations as
possible.2 A second Restraint view that follows from the above is the
notion that post--Cold War [[efforts to maintain]{.mark} U.S. global
**military [primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether **[[emphasizing
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** or active intervention, have most
often [**[produce]{.mark}**d [a]{.mark} **more dangerous**, **[less
stable world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby undermining the most vital
U.S. interest of safeguarding the security and well--being of the
American people.3 The United States is physically very secure behind two
oceans and with two friendly neighbors on its borders, and in any event
has the capability, through nuclear weapons and a territory--based
conventional power projection capability, to counter any direct or
indirect military threats to its most vital interests. The definition of
[vital national interests]{.underline} should thus be limited to the
defense and preservation of conditions directly necessary to the
territorial integrity, security, and well--being of the American people
and their way of life. This primarily requires the ability to protect
the nation against both direct and indirect, national, transnational,
and subnational threats to such interests, and a stable global order
open, as much as possible, to trade, investment, technological
innovation, and people--to--people contacts. It also requires
co--existence with countries with different political systems, congruent
with a stable and open global order. Above all, it requires a strong and
cohesive domestic political, economic, and social order. It [does
**not** require]{.underline} absolute security, the maintenance of [a
prominent global military presence,]{.underline} a reliance on [frequent
overseas military forays,]{.underline} [or]{.underline} extensive,
formal, often **[one--sided, security commitments]{.underline}** to a
wide range of other nations. A third Restraint viewpoint stresses the
fact that [the international system]{.underline} within which the United
States defends or advances its interests [is **no longer
unipolar**]{.underline}.4 The conditions that elevated the United States
to the status of global hegemon after the fall of the Soviet Union in
1991 no longer exist and cannot be restored. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has no]{.underline} practical [alternative but to
accept the reality of an increasingly multipolar world and recognize
that]{.underline} both **[continued U.S. dominance]{.underline}** and
world peace [are **illusions**]{.underline}. For the foreseeable future,
[mutual coexistence, compromise, and balance among the great powers will
have to suffice]{.underline} as an operative conception of "peace."5
This concept thus rejects the use of distorting and dangerous, usually
zero--sum ideological frameworks in understanding global politics, such
as "democracy versus authoritarianism," or a singular stress on "great
power competition."6 The Restraint view holds that, within this system,
[two **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential international
[**threats** endanger humankind]{.underline} above all else in the
present century: [first]{.underline}, the increased possibility of
large--scale **[nuclear war]{.underline}** ([as a result of]{.underline}
proliferation, new technologies, the erosion of arms control agreements,
and [deepening great power rivalries]{.underline}); [and
second]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} largely
**[unchecked]{.underline}** worsening of the **[climate
crisis]{.underline}** as the preeminent expression of global
environmental degradation.7 A third threat is primarily domestic and
mostly affects democratic states, although it certainly also has
international implications: the rise of extremely nationalist,
anti--democratic, race--based nativism and the political polarization
and dysfunction it engenders.8 For Restraint advocates, these threats
supersede any supposed global, value--based threats, including the
commonly perceived inflated and distorted international struggle between
democracy and authoritarianism, as well as narrower, conventional
security or economic rivalries among non--nuclear powers. In assessing
the role of diplomacy (and other non--military forms of international
engagement and conflict resolution) versus military force, despite the
introduction of new technologies, Restrainers believe that military
conflict remains fraught with risk, uncertainty, higher than expected
costs, and the likelihood of unexpected consequences. This fact, along
with the gradual emergence of a multipolar order and the frequent
historical failures of U.S.--led attempts to invade, occupy, and remake
distant nation--states, provide good reasons to prioritize diplomacy and
economic or other forms of non--violent tools of statecraft over
military intervention.9 While the political use of military capabilities
is in many cases essential in the conduct of diplomacy, any actual use
of force should be considered a last resort, employed only under extreme
conditions, and in the defense of vital interests only. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, as the
dominant military and economic power on the planet, [has
[developed]{.mark} and maintained [the **dangerous notion**]{.mark} that
only [American]{.mark} global **[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
"leadership" [[can keep the world **peaceful**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
ensure prosperity.10 Restrainers believe [this idea has led the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage]{.underline}
frequently [in]{.underline} a [**feckless misuse** of military
power]{.underline}, [resulting]{.underline} in large part [from
**inflated threats**]{.underline}, overconfidence, and a deep belief in
American exceptionalism. With the possible exception of Israel, [[**no
nation** employs force as frequently]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover,
many Americans remain strongly supportive of high levels of U.S. defense
spending and Washington's many global security alliances. However, many
[citizens are]{.underline} also [growing weary of U.S. military
interventions and]{.underline} the heavy [reliance on **military**
**options**]{.underline} in handling foreign problems.11 Large numbers
of Americans now favor diplomacy over military force.12 And some
question the need for large numbers of overseas military bases around
the world.13 This suggests popular support for a Restraint--oriented
foreign policy, including reduced defense spending if and as security
competitions with other great powers are reduced. Compounding the
problems caused by military intervention in the service of primacy is
the emergence in the United States of deep levels of public uncertainty
and insecurity about the future. The many factors underlying this
feeling of uncertainty include a crisis of legitimacy involving
widespread dissatisfaction with prevailing conceptions of freedom and
democracy when viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality,
as well as egregious government ineptitude, fiscal irresponsibility, and
persistent social problems.14 Politicians often exploit the worsening
domestic situation by inflating the threats posed by undemocratic states
like China to divert attention from their own responsibility for
problems at home and to unify their political base.15 Domestic
circumstances have also created a strong tendency toward an excessive
level of economic protectionism which, in the absence of countervailing
domestic policies, undermines growth and weakens incentives to cooperate
with China and other nations in handling common global economic and
financial threats.16 Restrainers assert that this dynamic, along with a
deeply--rooted commitment to sustaining high levels of defense spending
and hundreds of overseas bases, are increasing the chance of conflict
with non--democratic powers while undermining efforts to properly
define, prioritize and deal with threats at home and abroad.17 Finally,
many U.S. [friends and allies have]{.underline} both [the capacity and
the need to do **far more** to provide for their **own
defense**]{.underline}, thereby [allowing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to significantly reduce its **own global military
posture**]{.underline}. But Restraint does not encourage those countries
to rapidly ramp up their defense spending. Deepening interdependence,
the possibility of large--scale nuclear war, and the emergence of high
priority common security threats such as climate change all argue in
favor of efforts to reduce interstate security competition, which would
lower the need for ever higher defense budgets, and enhance incentives
for more cooperative forms of security.18 If successfully implemented,
[**[Restraint]{.mark}** as a basis of policy]{.underline} vis--à--vis
China [[will **buy**]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[**time** to]{.mark} repair its]{.underline}
severely [damaged domestic order and **[reallocate]{.mark}** national
security [resources]{.mark}]{.underline} to concerns that pose a greater
threat to the security and well--being of the American people than
China. More broadly, [[it will facilitate]{.mark} the identification of
**clear red lines**]{.underline} based on the protection of genuinely
vital interests, the adoption of prudent and balanced approaches to
contentious issues, [and]{.underline} the opening of intellectual and
political space allowing for **[greater
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}**, understanding, [[and
**compromise**]{.mark} between Washington and Beijing]{.underline}.19
[[This will]{.mark} significantly **[reduce]{.mark} the chances of
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Urgent Need to Right--Size the
China Threat Multipolarity and the end of American dominance, rising
domestic problems, looming, high--priority transnational threats, heavy
levels of global economic and technological interdependence, and the
resulting need to create a stable long--term basis for productive and
peaceful coexistence together justify an array of Restraint--based U.S.
policies toward Beijing. This must begin with a serious effort to
right--size the threats and opportunities that China poses, both now and
over time, to the international system, American democracy, economic
growth, and U.S. national security.20 Right--sizing the threats posed by
China, along with a fact--based assessment of current and likely future
U.S. and Western resources and capabilities, will provide the foundation
for a realistic and effective Restraint--based strategy toward China. A
responsible Restraint perspective acknowledges that there are
competitive aspects to the Sino--U.S. relationship, and that a
Sino--U.S. security dilemma, along with low levels of trust, is to some
extent unavoidable, especially given the different political systems of
the two nations and China's growing power, both globally and especially
in Asia. However, the security dilemma can certainly be alleviated
significantly, and not all great power competition need be zero--sum in
nature. Furthermore, most Sino--U.S. competitions will not end in a neat
"victory" for one side over the other, unless one or both regimes
collapse, an unlikely prospect. Excessive levels and types of
competition can unnecessarily undermine attempts at cooperation over
issues such as climate change, as trust disappears and the good will
needed to fashion mutual compromises evaporates.21 [The current U.S.
[policy toward China is]{.mark} largely [based on a]{.mark}
**zero--sum**, **[adversarial mindset]{.mark}** that assumes above all
else a **fundamental Chinese commitment** to **weakening** and
**countering the West**]{.underline} and resisting any form of
meaningful bilateral cooperation. [Beijing is regularly presented as a
vaguely--defined **existential threat**]{.underline}, a rapidly growing
military and economic power [bent on **global domination**]{.underline}
through predatory trade and investment practices and/or armed coercion,
a burgeoning high--tech superpower determined to control the key drivers
of future global growth, a hostile opponent of the existing so--called
"rules--based" international order, and a pernicious threat to
democratic societies from within.22 Moreover, in many instances, the
alarm over such supposedly dire threats is magnified by the inaccurate
claim that Washington had been essentially asleep at the wheel until
very recently as China worked to undermine the United States and all
democratic societies.23 China does pose certain challenges to existing
and likely future U.S. interests. These consist primarily of: • In the
military arena, the danger of costly and destabilizing conflicts or
severe crises, resulting from military and political provocations by
either Beijing or Washington (or by U.S. allies) e.g., over Taiwan,
disputed territories in Asia, the Korean Peninsula, or as a result of
incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft operating in
close proximity to one another.24 Chinese military and political actions
could also weaken U.S. alliances and reduce support for the
forward--deployed U.S. military presence in Asia and elsewhere, thereby
increasing the likelihood of arms races and miscalculations by the
United States, China, and other states.25 • In the economic and
technological area,26 the possibility of Chinese behavior eroding U.S.
economic growth rates, U.S. competitiveness in some key high--tech
areas, and possibly, in some extreme cases, U.S. access to certain
technologies and critical regions, most notably Asia. Chinese actions in
this area could also reduce the incentives for other nations to trade
and invest heavily with the United States, whether as a result of
Chinese pressure or zero--sum forms of competitiveness. China could
weaken free market norms in various ways, through its loan practices and
political influence. And Beijing could damage key U.S. corporations by
ejecting them from the critical Chinese market. • In the area of norms
and values, a concern that Chinese behavior over time could weaken
existing Western norms regarding liberal democratic governance, centered
on the rule of law, freedom of political speech and behavior, various
cyber freedoms, and individual voter rights, as well as current or
future norms concerning forms of foreign international intervention
relating to human rights. China challenges many of these norms by
stressing economic and physical security and top-down state authority
over the protection of individual political freedoms and the activities
of non-state actors outside of government control. While certainly very
troublesome, and requiring effective countermeasures in many cases,
[these concerns are not grave enough to justify the kind of absolute,
largely **zero--sum** and **confrontational approach** now common in
U.S. policies toward Beijing]{.underline}. Many [**gray areas** exist in
all three of the above realms, largely reflecting Chinese support for
long--standing core principles of the international order, such as
**state sovereignty**, a preference for **diplomacy** over
**force**]{.underline} in resolving disputes, [the use of force only in
defense of **imminent**]{.underline} and clear **[security
threats]{.underline}**, [open]{.underline} air and sea [lines of
communication]{.underline} and transport across international zones,
many [market--based forms of economic intercourse]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} various other **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[norms]{.underline}** and approaches. In
fact, critics of China's global stance often conflate the values and
norms of the global order, as reflected in various international regimes
and practices, with the U.S.--centered structure of global economic and
military power.27 In reality, the preservation or constructive
adaptation of most of the values, structures, and processes of the
global order does not require a single, dominant, democratic ruling
power. The limited and contingent nature of Chinese threats requires a
strong, competitive United States, clearer, more extensive, and to the
extent possible, binding bilateral and international agreements, and
specific, credible red lines regarding violations of truly vital
interests. It also requires a common international commitment to resolve
differences over contentious issues such as Taiwan, political rights and
protectionism or state capitalism through negotiation and compromise.
[Contrary to the prevailing mindset]{.underline} in Washington, [China
does not pose an **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential
**[threat to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates in the
above areas. [It is not in a position]{.underline} either to replace the
dominance of U.S. and Western economic and military power worldwide or
[to **overturn**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} so--called
**[liberal]{.underline}** world **[order]{.underline}**.28 As a military
power, Beijing poses no threat to the existence of the United States
except possibly via an extremely unlikely nuclear attack, which would be
suicidal. There is no evidence that China wants to threaten, much less
use, its relatively small (but growing), second--strike, counter--value
strategic nuclear force to attack the United States or its allies. To
the contrary, there is much evidence to suggest that [China's leadership
regards nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline} predominantly [as a
**deterrent**, not as a possible first--strike, offensive war
weapon]{.underline}.29 Moreover, Beijing's recent improvements of its
strategic nuclear forces are almost certainly intended primarily to
increase the survivability of its second--strike force in the face of
significant improvements in U.S. offensive nuclear capabilities and
ballistic missile defense. [The Chinese might]{.underline} also [be
expanding their nuclear arsenal in response to an increased fear that
Washington would]{.underline} level [nuclear threats or]{.underline}
actually [employ tactical nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} a future [Taiwan]{.underline} conflict, if the U.S.
military were losing on a conventional level.30 That speaks to the
urgent need to stabilize that worsening situation (as discussed below).
On the conventional level, Chinese military capabilities are for the
foreseeable future only of serious concern in the western Pacific, where
Beijing has reached a rough parity of forces with the United States and
Japan along the first island chain near Taiwan, and is arguably now the
dominant military power in the South China Sea, as measured in numbers
of naval and air platforms.31 But even in this vast region, [China is
not poised to acquire the kind of overwhelming conventional power that
would give it the military confidence]{.underline}, even in the face of
high political and economic costs, [to attempt to **seize Taiwan by
force**]{.underline}, [eject the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from the region, or assert total]{.underline},
direct [control over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea or maritime Asia as a whole --- unless, that is, the
United States were to force it to undertake the acquisition of such
capabilities and take such actions by threatening to permanently
separate Taiwan from China, or by precipitating a conflict in the
region.32 [Fears that China]{.underline} has decided in the near or
medium future to invade Taiwan and, going further, [is
planning]{.underline} eventual [aggression against other Asian states
are]{.underline} therefore **[unconvincing]{.underline}**.33 [The
lessons of]{.underline} the U.S. invasion of [**Iraq** and]{.underline}
particularly Russia's failures in [**Ukraine** reinforce for the Chinese
the difficulties of]{.underline} an all--out **[invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**, as discussed further in the appendix.34 Beyond
this, [[China is **nowhere near** acquiring]{.mark} the [capabilities to
replace the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as
a global military hegemon and shows few if any signs of having made a
commitment to do so.35 [This would require a force structure capable of
successfully fending off any attempt to defeat Chinese military
components within]{.underline} virtually [**any** ocean or air
space]{.underline}, and to safeguard passage to virtually any major
world port. The United States has enjoyed something approaching this
capacity for decades. [China is **far from attaining it** and currently
has **no clear imperative** to do so.]{.underline} This does not mean
China will eschew developing a military with a significant global
presence. It has already done this to some extent in the naval realm.
And Chinese leaders have said that their goal is to develop "world-class
forces" by 2049.36 But such a presence could take many forms well below
anything approaching that of the U.S. military today, including
relatively small--sized, high--quality flotillas or expeditionary groups
capable of conducting a variety of important missions well short of
achieving control overall critical international ocean areas and air
spaces.37 The above suggests that [China is unlikely to undertake an
**unprovoked**]{.underline}, out--of--the--blue **[lunge at
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [or **anywhere else** in the region]{.underline},
either today or in the near--to--medium---term (i.e., to about 2035).
[[The **most prominent threat** will emerge from
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulations**]{.underline} [[stemming from efforts by
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates, China,
and other nations [[to **deter**]{.underline}]{.mark} one another [in an
**extreme**]{.underline}, zero--sum [manner within a]{.underline}n
increasingly [**hostile** and **polarized** security landscape. [This
could involve]{.mark} a high--risk miscalculation and]{.underline}
resulting **[[overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the use of
military force]{.underline} by one or both sides [[stemming
from]{.underline}]{.mark} excessive [[**overconfidence** or
**insecurity**, in response to]{.mark} perceived
**[provocations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
primary]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**--related
**[threat]{.underline}** is not about the threat Beijing poses to the
United States, other nations, or the global order. It is the threat that
[arises from an interactive, **worsening security
competition**]{.underline} driven by threat inflation and zero--sum
worst casing of actions and motives on both sides.38 Moreover, [the
Chinese]{.underline} almost [certainly realize that any effort to
achieve]{.underline} global (or even regional) **[military
dominance]{.underline}** over the United States [will prove]{.underline}
extremely **[costly]{.underline}**, [could]{.underline} ultimately
[**fail**, or place it in a]{.underline} virtually
[endless]{.underline}, mutually debilitating zero--sum [military
rivalry]{.underline} with Washington. [This]{.underline} sort of gamble
i[s even more unlikely given the **enormous domestic challenges** that
[China faces]{.mark}, including]{.underline} high levels of
[[**pollution**, a]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly **[[aging
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a weakened leadership succession
system, [[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic natural
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [low]{.underline} levels of
[productivity]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} an excessively
ideological, **[repressive]{.underline}**, and top--down
[policy]{.underline} approach to [development]{.underline} and social
order.39 [[These]{.mark} challenges [demand]{.mark} a
continuous]{.underline}, long--term [[emphasis on]{.underline}]{.mark}
ensuring [**[domestic order]{.mark}** and **growth**, not expanding
China's powers to **dominate**]{.underline} all
**[others]{.underline}**. All this implies that, despite its ambitious
goals, likely belief that the West is in decline, and increasing
suspicion and pushback toward the United States, [Beijing's policies
will]{.underline} necessarily [allow]{.underline} for some level of
[flexibility that could make]{.underline} global (and even Asian)
[competition more constructive and less destructive]{.underline}, while
keeping many doors open to some level of meaningful cooperation between
the two powers, including in the military--security arena. It is
certainly not inconceivable that growing threats to China's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) and overseas economic and political interests
could one day cause China's leaders to fundamentally reassess the
nation's strategic interests and goals in the direction of a costly,
dominance--oriented military strategy. Nonetheless, it would be reckless
to assume that such a reassessment is inevitable and that the many
factors in favor of cooperation and balance in China's present--day
global (and regional) strategy will disappear. Indeed, [the huge costs
and risks involved in a Chinese attempt to displace the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates as the dominant global military
power [are unlikely to diminish to such a degree]{.underline} in the
decades ahead [that Beijing would conclude it is worth the
effort]{.underline} to undertake --- **[unless]{.underline}**, of
course, [Washington makes it clear that it is using its]{.underline}
global [military dominance]{.underline} to support efforts [to
**strangle China** and **threaten the stability** of its
**government**]{.underline}.40 In the economic and technological arenas,
blanket, unqualified characterizations of China's economy as "predatory"
or "mercantilist" and its loan and assistance programs as
"debt--inducing" distort the reality that some Chinese abuses exist
alongside huge levels of mutual economic benefit for many countries.41
Moreover, China poses a limited, not comprehensive and existential,
economic and technological threat to the United States, in the form of
commercial and technology theft (of which at least the latter is
apparently diminishing), unfair trading practices, and other activities
that result in unfair advantages or possibly dominance in some specific
areas.42 It is highly unlikely that such practices would result in
decisive Chinese leverage over the United States, given the likelihood
of continued American global economic and technological power and
expertise, based on the continuation of its high--quality higher
education system, its rule of law, its competitive energy and drive, its
overall receptivity to talented immigrants, and its ample domestic
resource base.43 All of these features urgently need strengthening. But
this places an even greater premium on reducing distracting and
destructive tensions with China. And in any event, America's advantages
are unlikely to diminish to such an extent that China will achieve
decisive leverage over the United States, given its own huge domestic
problems. There is also the threat that would result from excessive
decoupling of the United States and China in many economic and
technological areas. Such actions would produce high levels of
inefficiency, lower the benefits of global exchange, and create
excessive confidence in the quixotic goal of removing all
vulnerabilities to the U.S. economy.44 As a result, U.S. (and Chinese)
economic growth and resiliency would decline, along with overall global
growth and prosperity. In addition, it is virtually certain that [any
effort by Beijing to create a **Sino-centric**]{.underline}, hegemonic
regional (or global) [**order** would encounter **serious
resistance**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} many other [major
states]{.underline} aside from the United States (such as Japan, South
Korea, India, Germany, France, and the U.K.), many of
[which]{.underline} have or could muster considerable economic and
military capabilities and [would]{.underline} politically and
ideologically [**oppose** being dominated by an **autocratic
China**]{.underline}. Although these states could not counterbalance
Chinese aggression on their own, they would likely unify to greatly
augment a U.S. effort to do so, if necessary.45 Regarding global norms,
despite assertions by some to the contrary, [China is **not
committed**]{.underline} (and does not have the capability) [to
**overturn**]{.underline} what many describe as [the **global
order**]{.underline}, replacing it with an autocratic, mercantilist,
Sinocentric order.46 First, this argument relies on the false notion
that such an order is centered primarily, if not solely, on the three
principles of democracy, human rights, and a free market economic
system. In reality, [the global order consists of a wide array of
norm--based regimes and understandings]{.underline}, only some of which
are associated with Western--defined concepts.47 Moreover, numerous
studies have shown that [[Beijing **benefits from** and
**upholds**]{.mark} the goals and **[norms]{.mark}** of many of these
regimes]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those governing relatively
[**[free trade]{.mark}** and finance]{.underline}, weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) **[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [[freedom of
**navigation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the **[[peaceful
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of disputes, [and]{.underline} the
management of [transnational security threats]{.underline} China presses
for reforms in global institutions that are, in many cases, long
overdue, including the idea of providing greater representation for
China and developing states in multilateral economic organizations.48
Beijing does want to reduce the influence of Western liberal democratic
values within global regimes in favor of a more state--centered set of
views that reflect the values of economic growth, top--down political
control, limited political freedoms, and social order. However, despite
some American rhetoric to the contrary, [Beijing is not energetically
engaged in a deliberate effort to duplicate its system across the
world]{.underline}, nor poised to establish a predatory, debt--inducing
network of dominance across Eurasia via the Belt and Road Initiative.49
In fact, unlike many 19th and early 20th century imperialist powers,
with some limited exceptions during the revolutionary Mao Zedong era in
the 1970s, [China has **not espoused an ideology** or **mindset** that
views the **acquisition of other territories** or the coercive expansion
of its system]{.underline} to other countries [as essential]{.underline}
to its continued national vitality.50 Finally[, the so--called global
order is rapidly becoming a multipolar order that **no single country**
can **dominate**]{.underline} in most or all spheres.51 Hence, even if
Beijing wanted to create a Sinocentric order, it is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to see how they could make this happen. Despite the
above developments and conflicting interests, Beijing continues to
recognize its own need to sustain substantive areas of cooperation with
Washington and to avoid slipping into a truly adversarial, destructive,
and purely mercantilist form of competition. While increasingly
assertive, the Chinese see the obvious problems of such a stance. Of
course, it is possible that Beijing eventually comes to regard the high
risks of engaging in such intense competition as worth taking, if the
danger of not doing so increases. Such a change in perception could
occur in part as a result of [[a]{.mark} continued U.S.]{.underline} or
broader Western [[drive toward]{.mark} **[confrontation]{.mark}** and
**zero--sum competition** with Beijing.]{.underline} This development
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} greatly
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [[voices within China who
favor **moderation**]{.mark} in the **U.S.--China
rivalry**]{.underline}. In addition [it would]{.underline} significantly
[[**raise the danger** of Sino--American **crises**]{.mark} and
**military conflict**]{.underline}, [[and divert]{.mark}
**[huge]{.mark}** amounts of U.S. [**resources** away from]{.mark}
**desperately needed**]{.underline} non--military **[uses at
[home]{.mark}]{.underline}** and abroad.52 The Key Elements of a
Restraint Approach to China From the above, it is clear that
[a]{.underline} responsible [Restraint strategy toward China

#### Multipolarity is inevitable, but clinging provokes [nuclear war]{.underline} 

Chris **Wright 23**, professor of history at the City University of New
York, Ph.D., 4/28/2023, \"The Second Cold War Is More Dangerous than the
First,\"
https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/04/28/the-second-cold-war-is-more-dangerous-than-the-first/

Modern history shows that [[the **most dangerous periods** are when
two]{.mark} or more [great powers are **struggling for
heg**]{.mark}]{.underline}emony. The eighteenth century in Europe was a
time of "multipolarity," as Britain, France, Prussia, Austria, and
Russia were almost continually at war, competing for geopolitical
advantage and to divide the continent between them. [The conflicts
escalated in the era of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, as a
mighty France]{.underline}, bursting with revolutionary energy,
[**strove** for **absolute dominance** against]{.underline}, in the end,
[Britain and Russia]{.underline}. The 1815 Congress of Vienna led to a
century-long balance of power presided over by an industrializing
Britain, which soon became the supreme world power. Once
industrialization swept the rest of Europe, however, particularly
Germany, Britain's power began to be challenged, not only in the
Scramble for Africa but in Europe itself. [German elites wanted their
country to be the next Britain, and to a great extent it was their
**desire for heg**emony that precipitated **both world
wars**]{.underline}. Since 1945, the United States has been virtually a
global hegemon. As John Ross notes in the recently published
Washington's New Cold War, even at the height of its relative economic
achievement in the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union's GDP was only 44 percent
of the U.S.'s. The Soviets had vast power in their limited sphere
encompassing Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but they were not a
capitalistically expansive, dynamically growing imperial power in the
mode of the United States---or, more recently, of a resurgent China.
[[China's]{.mark} GDP is 74 percent of the U.S.'s, and its [**growth
rate** is]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} ([it has grown **[seven times
faster]{.mark}** than the **America**n economy since 2007]{.underline}).
[[Measured by **purchasing power**]{.mark} parities, the U.S. accounts
for only **16 percent** of the world economy, and [China's economy
is]{.mark} 18 percent **[larger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, for
the first time since World War II, [we are entering an era of real
competition between two mammoth economies, a declining hegemon and an
aspiring hegemon.]{.underline} When people talk about "the China
threat," this is, in effect, all they mean. In the long run, China poses
a greater threat to U.S. power than the Soviet Union ever did.
Mainstream commentators and politicians prate about China's threat to
democratic values and human rights---there always has to be an
ideological rationalization for geopolitical strategy---but [U.S.
foreign and domestic policy]{.underline} since the Second World War
[tells us how much its elites care about democracy and human rights.
From]{.underline} the **[Vietnam]{.underline}** War [to]{.underline} the
catastrophic invasion of **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} from
[U.S. support for]{.underline} thugs like **[Batista]{.underline}**,
**[Diem]{.underline}**, Iran's Shah, Suharto, Duvalier, Trujillo,
Somoza, **[Pinochet]{.underline}**, Marcos, Rios Montt, Mobutu,
**[Saddam Hussein]{.underline}**, Mubarak, Sisi, **[Modi]{.underline}**,
**[M]{.underline}**ohammed **[b]{.underline}**in
**[S]{.underline}**alman, [and Netanyahu to **CIA coups**]{.underline}
and attempted coups [against **countless governments**]{.underline}, it
is self-evident that [policymakers care little about the moral values
they pretend to espouse.]{.underline} Americans have to ask themselves:
[[is it worth]{.mark} **risking nuclear war**---and]{.underline} an
**[[apocalyptic nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for no loftier
purpose than [[to maintain their]{.underline}]{.mark} country's
[**violently enforced [grasp]{.mark}** [of **overwhelming**]{.mark}
**global [power]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Threats to U.S. Power The
current flashpoint, of course, is the war in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[is helping]{.mark} to
midwife [a]{.mark} "**[partnership]{.mark}**" [between China and
Russia]{.mark}, both of [which are]{.mark} also
**[deepening]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[**ties** with
**Iran**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Decades ago, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote
that "a coalition allying Russia with both China and Iran can develop
only if [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is shortsighted
enough to **antagonize China** and **Iran**
**simultaneously**]{.underline}." He would presumably not be very happy
with [U.S. policies]{.underline} that [are bringing about]{.underline}
exactly [this coalition]{.underline}. At the same time, U.S. [missteps
in the Middle East and]{.underline} its relative
[disengagement]{.underline} from the region since the Obama presidency
[are **allow**ing China to improve its position there, as illustrated by
the deal it]{.underline} recently [brokered between Iran and
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [to normalize relations]{.underline}. China's
burgeoning economic interests not only in the Middle East but across
most of the world, a function of its colossal, globe-spanning Belt and
Road Initiative, require the country to play an ever-greater diplomatic
role in fraught regions. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, for its part, [has
shown it is happy to defy Washington, even]{.underline} joining much of
the world in [disregarding]{.underline} Western [sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}. While [Washington's **failure** to convince most
countries to]{.underline} economically and diplomatically [**isolate
Russia** highlights the U.S.'s declining]{.underline}
"**[heg]{.underline}**emony," [the real **threats** to American
power]{.underline} [**run deeper** than **diplomatic
embarrassments**]{.underline}. In coming years, [the]{.underline} very
[status of the dollar as the world's dominant currency may be
threatened]{.underline}. A kind of "**[de-dollarization]{.underline}**"
[has been happening]{.underline} for some time now, as, for example,
[the share of **dollar reserves** held by central banks declined from 71
percent]{.underline} in 1999 [to **59** percent]{.underline} in 2021.
[But]{.underline} in the last few years, and especially
[since]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine, the]{.underline}
ongoing [effort]{.underline} by many countries [to undermine the
dollar's dominance of the global financial system has
**intensified**]{.underline}. In part, [this is because of the U.S.'s
"**weaponization**" of the dollar]{.underline}: in the recent past,
Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan, and Russia have all suffered from
financial and trade sanctions that have included even freezing overseas
assets and removal from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins the
world's financial infrastructure. [Other countries]{.underline},
understandably [worried about suffering the same fate, share Russia's
interest in developing **new financial institutions**]{.underline} and
networks [outside of the U.S.-led system]{.underline}. Apart from this
motivation, they simply want to reduce their exposure to the effects of
U.S. economic and monetary policy, which can devastate economies. And
[as China rises, it makes sense for it to promote use of the
renminbi]{.underline}, or at least non-dollar currencies. To that end,
[the BRICS countries]{.underline}, for instance, [have been establishing
[new institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} and market mechanisms [to
[**bypass** the dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}, and are even exploring the
possibility of creating a new reserve currency based on the BRICS basket
of currencies. [Institutions like [the **N**]{.mark}ew
**[D]{.mark}**evelopment **[B]{.mark}**ank]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**hanghai
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ooperation
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization, [new payment infrastructures
that are [alternatives to **SWIFT**]{.mark}]{.underline}, central bank
digital currencies, bilateral trade conducted in currencies other than
the dollar, [[and]{.mark} a **[renminbi oil futures]{.mark}** market
to]{.underline} partially [de-dollarize the]{.underline} global [oil
trade all point toward a future currency regime]{.underline} that is at
least multilateral, if not bilateral. The economist Nouriel Roubini
argues that, "in a world that will be increasingly divided into two
geopolitical spheres of influence," [a bilateral currency regime is
likely to emerge]{.underline}, perhaps in the next decade. [Given
that]{.underline} "[[the dollar]{.mark}'s dominant position]{.underline}
in the global financial system [[\[is\] the]{.mark} very [**foundation**
of]{.mark} \[the U.S.'s\] **global [leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
as two experts note, Washington can hardly be viewing all these
developments with equanimity. Loss of the dollar's status as the world's
reserve currency would have severe consequences for the American
economy. But this outcome is exactly the end-goal of Washington's
bellicose policies toward its perceived rivals! [[Through]{.mark}

The strategic **[[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}** regime---which
provides the foundation for global stability between the world's two
largest nuclear powers---[[is in **jeopardy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
during the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union [were able to
avoid **nuclear** confrontation by]{.underline} maintaining [reliable
**[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline} channels, routine [diplomatic
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} on arms control,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} establishing mutually agreed
[[safeguards]{.mark} to [avoid **escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
clashes [beyond]{.underline} a given threshold, [**accidents**, or
misperception.]{.underline} The experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis
that brought the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear
war heightened appreciation for the importance of cultivating a robust
nuclear arms control regime to deter U.S. and Soviet/Russian leadership
from resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. Since the 1970s, the
Soviet Union/Russia and the United States have concluded a series of
strategic arms agreements ensuring transparency and reliable mutual
verification protocols. Along with introducing transformational reforms
of glasnost and perestroika on the domestic front, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was able to accomplish tremendous strides working with U.S.
President Ronald Reagan to achieve major bilateral nuclear arms
reductions. The fact that many fewer nations have acquired nuclear
capabilities and the international community avoided clashes involving
the use of nuclear weapons must be attributed for the most part to the
stable core foundations of the U.S.-Soviet/Russia nuclear security
regime. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) that was set to
expire in 2026 has been halted. Russia's war in Ukraine and its severing
of relationships with the United States and its Western allies and the
collapse of U.S.-Russian strategic dialogue and engagement on arms
control, coupled with China's accelerated drive toward nuclear expansion
and escalating tensions in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, have
ushered in a new period of instability and risk for arms control and
proliferation. U.S. President Joe Biden has acknowledged that
[[we]{.mark} have [reached an]{.mark} "**[inflection point]{.mark}**"
that]{.underline} will [determine]{.underline} the [future
**security**]{.underline} for our allies and partners and the world
community for decades ahead, but the circumstances require careful
assessment of strategic options and consequences of policy choices.
[Innovative [**approaches** will]{.mark}]{.underline} be required to
[[prevent]{.mark} catastrophic [**nuclear escalation** and
**prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline} of weapons of mass destruction
[as the world system transitions from]{.underline} an era of bipolar
[nuclear stability]{.underline} to a more comartifiplex three major
power nuclear configuration. Ukraine War, Derailing U.S.-Russia
Strategic Nuclear Collaboration, Risk of Nuclear Response In the past,
it has been the expectation that the United States and Soviet
Union/Russia could compartmentalize differences to prevent other
contentious issues in the bilateral relationship from interfering with
the critical areas of nuclear security and arms control. However, the
fact that Ukraine has been defined as an "existential" security priority
for Russia's leadership suggests that it is no longer a safe assumption
that Moscow will separate clashes on Ukraine from collaboration with the
United States on nuclear security. While the United States and the
Soviet Union/Russia were able to manage competition and differences in
the past on Angola, Ethiopia, Central America, Afghanistan, and, more
recently ,in the Middle East (Iraq, Libya, Syria) without undermining
strategic arms control, Ukraine's location bordering the Russian
Federation with a large Russian-speaking population and extensive
historical, cultural, and geostrategic ties elevates its importance to a
level of being associated by Russia's leadership with survival of the
state. In January 2023, the U.S. State Department reported that it was
no longer possible to verify that Russia was complying with New START
due to the Kremlin's unwillingness to allow for on-site inspections.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to suspend New
START in February 2023, linking resumption of the treaty with an end to
Western military support for Ukraine. The Biden administration responded
by expressing interest in engaging Russia to manage nuclear risks and
develop a post-2026 arms control framework. While Kremlin spokesperson
Dmitri Peskov described the suggestion of the U.S. administration as
"important and positive," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov
reiterated that **[[unless]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and the West as a whole [do not
radically **[revise]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[anti-Russian
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}...productive negotiations on [[arms
control]{.mark} will **[hardly]{.mark}** be
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[**Although** Russia has]{.mark} a
**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se nuclear policy, since unleashing the
"special military operation" in Ukraine in February 2022,
[[Putin]{.mark} has [not ruled out]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the event
that the survival of the Russian Federation was threatened. For Putin,
Russia's territory includes those areas annexed from Ukraine since 2014
(Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia). At the time of
launching Russia's incursion into Ukraine, Putin placed Russia's nuclear
forces on alert and warned that those interfering with Russia's
operation in Ukraine would face consequences on a scale "you have never
seen in your entire history." In September 2022, after annexing four
Ukrainian oblasts to Russia, Putin stated, "[In the]{.underline} event
of a [**threat** to]{.underline} the [territorial integrity]{.underline}
of our country [and to **defend Russia**]{.underline} and our people,
[we will]{.underline} certainly [**make use** of all weapon
systems]{.underline} available to us. This is not a bluff." Russia's
military forces seized control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
which is the largest in Europe early on in the war generating concerns
about possible nuclear disaster. In March 2023, Putin announced that
[Russia would station **t**]{.underline}actical
**[n]{.underline}**uclear **[w]{.underline}**eapon**[s]{.underline}** in
Belarus contending this was [no different than]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[positioning nuclear assets among]{.underline} allied nations in
[Europe]{.underline}. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>. Putin's
remarks at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum in July 2023 seemed to dial
back concerns about nuclear responses in Ukraine. Putin justified moving
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus as an "element of deterrence" for
those "thinking about inflicting strategic defeat" of Russia. Following
recounting setbacks in Ukraine's counteroffensive, Putin reiterated that
Russia's official doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in
situations where the survival of the nation was threatened but then
implied that this option was not necessary at this point. In mid-August
2023, the United States announced approval for the Netherlands and
Denmark to provide F16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Russia has been targeted
with a series of drone strikes on military installations and buildings
in civilian areas over the past months attributed to Ukrainians
operating within the Russian Federation. Following announcement in
August 2023 that the Biden administration would provide the 45 tranche
of military assistance in Ukraine, including additional ammunition for
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and anti-armor
rockets, Hydra 70 rockets, and 3 million rounds of small arms
ammunition, the head of Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS Yuri Borisov
stated that the Sarmat MIRV equipped intercontinental ballistic missile
had been placed into service---a weapon that Putin had said would make
Moscow's enemies "think twice." Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security
Council Dmitry Medvedev has issued periodic warnings about a nuclear
scenario stating that "loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can
provoke the outbreak of nuclear war" and that Russia may be forced to
use a nuclear weapon if Ukraine's counteroffensive succeeds. On August
28, 2023, Medvedev posted on Telegram that Ukraine's approval from
Western nations for missile strikes throughout Russia or to attack
Crimea unfortunately indicates that the "prophecies of the Apocalypse"
were closer. Statements from Russia's leadership on willingness to
resort to the use of nuclear weapons over Ukraine have been echoed by
discussions taking place among leading defense experts. Sergei
Karaganov, former presidential advisor and dean of the Higher School of
Economics in Moscow, published an article in June 2023 calling for
Russia to undertake preemptive nuclear strikes against several European
countries as a way to end the war in Ukraine. While Karaganov
acknowledged that this would be a "terrible choice" on a moral level, he
contends that it is necessary to prevent the West from leading the world
to a final "full-scale" and "last world war for humanity.\" Karaganov's
article prompted a series of responses among other leading analysts of
Russia's foreign policy community contending that employing a nuclear
strike would not "sober up the West" or that Karaganov's position
"underestimates the willingness of Western elites' determination to
climb the escalation ladder with Russia, and, if necessary ahead of
it\..."Former head of the Carnegie Moscow Center Dmitry Trenin affirmed
that nuclear weapons have been "on the table" from the outset and that
basing U.S. strategy on the "belief that the Russian leadership will not
dare use nuclear weapons in the current conflict" was an "extremely
dangerous misperception." Russia's channel 1 and other state-sponsored
media networks have hosted programs with pundits, analysts, and
legislative leaders calling for nuclear responses over Ukraine. U.S.
President Biden cautioned at the outset of the Ukraine conflict that a
direct U.S.-Russia war must be avoided because of nuclear risks. In
October 2022, Biden warned that the risk of nuclear "armageddon" was the
highest it had been since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Biden has said
that there was no way to use tactical nuclear weapons on a battlefield
without it ending in Armageddon. In June 2023, he stated that the threat
issued by Putin to use nuclear weapons was "real" and that deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was "absolutely irresponsible." U.S.
officials have warned of "catastrophic consequences" for nuclear use,
but Biden has remained ambiguous in spelling out scenarios and likely
U.S. responses, which have traditionally been essential for deterrence.
Several analysts have tended to downplay threats of the use of nuclear
weapons coming from Moscow as "bluffing," but others have not dismissed
the possibility or even certainty. Although Putin has referenced the
doctrinal foundation and taken steps to prepare for employing a nuclear
response, he must weigh the consequences in loss of life, destruction of
the environment and infrastructure, and damage to existing significant
international partnerships. China, India, and other valuable partner
nations for Russia have emphasized that nuclear weapons should not be
used in the Ukraine war. There are options available to Russia in the
conventional, cyber, or other domains that would not entail the costs of
using nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is a high risk that the
war in Ukraine could escalate involving neighboring nations evoking an
Article V response from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the potential for unleashing a nuclear response should not be ruled
out. The longer the war in Ukraine continues the greater the risk of
miscalculation and accidents that could result in a nuclear
confrontation. Russia had supported Washington and Beijing in containing
North Korea's nuclear development, but the fact that Putin has turned to
Kim Jong-un as a source for ammunition for the Ukraine war with the
prospect for Russia-North Korea cooperation in the nuclear sphere
represents a setback for managing nuclear security and proliferation.
Russia's military cooperation with Iran in the wake of the war in
Ukraine with Tehran providing lethal drone technology and Moscow
offering diplomatic support to Iran poses further complications for
nuclear safeguard compliance. The suspension of the U.S.-Russia New
START, threats of resorting to the use of nuclear weapons and shifting
geopolitical alignments resulting from clashes over Ukraine has
destabilized the global nuclear security order. The issue of perhaps
highest priority on the U.S.-Russia security agenda, ongoing
collaboration among the two nations holding the world's largest nuclear
arsenals, is now in question. NATO Enlargement, Failed Diplomacy, Costs
and Risks of Military Engagement \<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>. Moscow's
invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine has come at enormous cost,
but [the **West**]{.underline} also [[made]{.mark} strategic
**[choices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [contributed to **[provoking
conflict]{.mark}** with Russia. [Russia's]{.mark}
leadership]{.underline}, defense, [and]{.underline} foreign policy
[community]{.underline} [**[consistently]{.underline}** [expressed
**opposition** to expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Western security
alliance. George F. Kennan, architect of America's post-World War II
Soviet containment strategy, had warned that expansion of NATO would be
"[the most **fateful error** of American policy]{.underline} in the
entire post-Cold War era." Moscow tolerated the first rounds of NATO
enlargement in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, but claimed that NATO's
military involvement in Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO crossed a
line constituting a serious immediate and long-term potential threat to
Russia. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\> Moscow's leadership had
broached proposals to develop a European security architecture that
would take account of Russia's interests. In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev, then
serving as president of the Russian Federation, advanced a proposal for
a new European security order followed by additional proposals prior to
the invasion of Ukraine that were not afforded serious consideration
among Western nations. Suggestions in the aftermath of the unraveling of
the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact that NATO was dead or had no purpose
were unfounded. NATO provided a platform for bringing nations together
to strengthen capacity for addressing a broad range of significant
security challenges including promoting collaboration in managing
weapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism, cyber and maritime
cooperation, providing disaster support, and much more. Together with
the EU, NATO offered assistance to Soviet successor nations in Europe
and Eurasia for democratic reform, defense transformation, and capacity
building. The NATO-Russia Council fostered practical security
cooperation and consultation until Moscow's annexation of Crimea in
2014, but, for Russians, NATO enlargement was considered a betrayal of
pledges on the part of the United States and its allies that NATO would
not expand and the possibility of Ukraine engaging in military
collaboration with the Western security alliance or Ukraine joining NATO
became a defining red-line for the Kremlin. The reality is that Ukraine
was not a likely candidate for NATO membership in the foreseeable
future, but Western involvement in the Euro-Maidan uprising that
contributed to unseating Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor
Yanukovych prompted Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The collapse of the
Minsk peace process and lack of commitment in finding a workable
diplomatic solution for resolving differences between Kyiv and Moscow on
Crimea and Russian-speaking communities in Donbas escalated into the
devastating war witnessed today. The disclosure by former German
Chancellor Angela Merkel revealing that Germany and other Western
nations were not sincere about reaching a diplomatic settlement between
Russia and Ukraine, but only sought to gain time for Ukraine to enhance
NATO military collaboration and presence in Ukraine has done nothing to
enlist confidence that a diplomatic settlement would be possible. The
Russia-Ukraine war has cost thousands of lives, displaced much of the
Ukrainian population, destabilized the European and Eurasian security
and economic orders, and disrupted global energy and food supplies. Had
Ukraine been willing to forego NATO membership remaining neutral, this
war would likely have been averted. Dedicated commitment on the part of
all involved to pursue diplomatic channels toward developing alternative
approaches for the post-Cold War European security structure would
certainly have been preferable to suffering the tragic losses in
Ukraine. There is no reason that Ukraine should not have been able to
maintain ties with Russia and other Eastern European neighbors while
simultaneously benefitting from cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic
community. Moscow's leadership contends that this is not simply a
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that the West wants to destroy
Russia. The perception that the West seeks strategic defeat of the
Russian state is not unfounded. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's
public statement that the United States intends to "weaken Russia" by
providing military support to Ukraine and frequent comments on prospects
for regime change in Moscow by Western policy officials and analysts
reinforces the Kremlin's assessments regarding U.S./Western intentions.
Any strategy aimed to destabilize and drive a major world nuclear power
into a rogue nation status is obviously misguided and dangerous. Russia
is still a European power and stabilizing Moscow's relationships with
nations of the transatlantic community will remain consequential for
European and wider global security. Ukraine's most recent June 2023
counteroffensive has been unsuccessful and it should be understood that
Ukraine can not win a war with a much larger committed nuclear power.
Anticipating the difficulties ahead for the Ukrainian military in
re-taking occupied territories, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley had said in late 2022 after successes in Kharkiv and Kherson
that it might be time to consider entering into discussions on a
political settlement. This suggestion was widely rejected, and the Biden
administration has been clear that decisions on ending the war in
Ukraine would rest with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and the
Ukrainian population. However, the setbacks in Ukraine's most recent
June 2023 counteroffensive has generated consideration among some in the
administration about the need for an exit strategy. The current period
of geopolitical upheaval in Europe and Eurasia is fraught with risks and
at a minimum it will be important for the United States and its allies
to support Ukraine in re-building and to stabilize relationships with
Russia in order to prevent a wider Russia-NATO or world war. It is
important to recognize that a consequence of the choices that have been
made over Ukraine present major obstacles for continuation of a central
U.S. security priority that has ensured global stability over the past
decades, the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms regime. If the war in Ukraine
continues to grind on for years or becomes a "forever war," the
prospects for negotiating a new START agreement before it expires in
2026 may be over, ending an era of cooperation in arms control and
proliferation. This should be a major motivating factor for resuming
dialogue and diplomacy toward ending the war in Ukraine avoiding further

**[[Russia-China]{.underline}]{.mark}** Strategic Partnership and
Prospects for Tripartite Major Power Nuclear Engagement Although the
history of the Sino-Russian relationship has not been without clashes,
[the two countries have become]{.underline} more [closely
**aligned**]{.underline} over the past decade forging a burgeoning
"strategic partnership" [described]{.underline} by Russia's President
Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping [as a "partnership
without limits."]{.underline} Following escalation of tensions with the
West over Russia's annexation of Crimea, Moscow moved to further
strengthen its relationship with Beijing. Moscow continued to turn to
China to offset stringent economic sanctions imposed by the United
States and its European allies in response to Russia's military
incursion in Ukraine. Beijing attributes the Russo-Ukraine war to
Western meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics and NATO's tendency to
remain locked in a Cold War mindset insisting on expansion of the
alliance. [Russia and China [find]{.mark} **common
[ground]{.mark}**]{.underline} in [[resisting]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
global [**hegemony** and challenging [American
**leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the rules-based liberal
international order. **[[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} believe that they [[should be **entitled**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[greater **influence**]{.mark} in shaping
world order]{.underline} in the contemporary multipolar system. Though
the two countries no longer share ideological affinity, both Vladimir
Putin and Xi Jinping are concerned about protecting security of the
state and have been united in opposing Western intervention to advance
democracy which they contend has resulted in chaos and destabilizing
societies. Moscow and Beijing want to ensure that the kind of domestic
turmoil that fueled the color revolutions in Eurasia and upheavals in
the Middle East will never pose threats of regime change in their
respective nations. Cultivation of relationships on the part of Russia
and China with nations of the Global South is another means of
counterbalancing the influence of the United States and its Western
allies. Both countries issue narratives emphasizing legacies of Western
imperialism, moral decadence, and claims of exceptionalism invoking
calls for respecting the diversity of world civilizations and
traditions. Offering investment without imposing domestic requirements
has contributed to China surpassing U.S. economic presence throughout
much of the world. The significant expansion of numbers of nations that
would like to join BRICS threatens the preeminence of U.S. currency and
influence in global finance and economic development over the long term.
[Russia and China]{.underline} have [**[expanded]{.mark}**
military-to-military [**cooperation** and]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[held]{.underline} routine [large-scale military
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 2018 [[in **Asia**, the
**Baltics**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Mediterranean]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [Russia]{.underline} has
[sold]{.underline} some of its most [advanced]{.underline} military
[equipment to China]{.underline}. While China's economy far exceeds that
of Russia, Russia as one of the world's two largest nuclear powers can
offer support to China in accelerating nuclear development. During the
visit of Xi Jinping to Russia in March 2023, [Putin
announced]{.underline} that Russia's state atomic energy corporation
Rosatom and China's Atomic Energy Agency had entered into a long-term
contract that would include [[exporting **plutonium**]{.mark} from
Russia to China]{.underline} for use in nuclear reactors potentially
[[contributing to]{.underline}]{.mark} more [rapid [**expansion**
of]{.mark} China's [nuclear **arsenal**]{.mark}. [China and
Russia]{.mark} do **not** yet have]{.underline} an
"**[alliance]{.underline}**," [but]{.underline} the two countries have
been [[driven **closer** as]{.mark} a [result of
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States. While the conflict
over Ukraine has led to collapse of the initial post-Soviet
rapprochement between the United States and Russia, [the
U.S.-China]{.underline} bilateral [[**relationship**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[strained over
**Taiwan**]{.underline},]{.mark} competition for [influence in [the
**S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea and wider Asia, economic reprisals in
[the tech]{.underline}nology [sphere]{.underline}, and more. The
Russia-China strategic partnership has advanced too far to hope that the
United States would be able to drive a wedge between the two countries.
The Biden administration's identification of the struggle between
democracy and autocracy as the guiding vision for [American foreign
policy]{.underline} presents additional difficulties for enlisting
cooperation in nuclear security and other critical areas or to avoid
[**uniting** Russia and China]{.underline} against American interests.
In considering approaches to arms control in the current conflictual and
rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances, U.S. policy officials
should understand that both Moscow and Beijing will expect an equal say
in setting terms for engagement. Major regional concerns for both
countries including Ukraine for Russia and Taiwan for China stand as
impediments to advancing cooperation in nuclear security. Toward a
Tripartite Nuclear Framework for the 21st Century Global Security
Environment Concepts for policies of the past that were effective in
containing geopolitical and ideological clashes among nuclear rivals
such as "peaceful coexistence" and "détente" or aspirations for building
U.S.-Russian "strategic partnership" in the early post-Soviet period no
longer exist. [There is much **greater focus**]{.underline} today
[on]{.underline} what is perceived as inevitable peer or near-peer
[major power **confrontation** rather than considering ways
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline} of different historical experience,
cultures, values, and core interests [[might]{.underline}]{.mark}
co-exist and [**[cooperate]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[ensure]{.underline} strategic [security]{.underline}. [**Policymakers**
of]{.underline} the [three nations **[confront]{.mark}**]{.underline} an
emerging global security environment that is more daunting not only
because of [**transition** from a bipolar to a **tripolar**
major]{.underline} power [nuclear order]{.underline}, but also because
protecting nuclear security has become more problematic because of [new
developments in]{.underline} areas such [as [**space**, **cyber**, or
**a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence.]{.underline} If the
United States and Russia are not able to establish a framework for
continued collaboration in arms control after the expiration of START in
2026 and China is not engaged in nuclear arms control, [the global
**community** will face]{.underline} unprecedented circumstances of
[unconstrained **nuclear** arms **competition**]{.underline}. Beijing is
on track to have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 and has been exceeding
predictions in terms of the pace of development in nuclear capacity, but
China has traditionally been unwilling to participate in arms control
believing that this would only provide advantages to nations with much
larger nuclear arsenals. While the prospects for forging a tripartite
nuclear regime appear quite limited in the current
geopolitical/strategic circumstances, it is simply too important for
global security not to make every effort to preserve longstanding
cooperation with Russia in arms control and proliferation and to foster
nuclear security cooperation with Beijing. Prior to the Ukraine war, we
suggested that the U.S. administration might boldly propose a tripartite
security dialogue with Russia and China to manage nuclear challenges and
other security issues of shared concern. This approach would underscore
U.S. recognition of the major power status of both countries and the
importance of engaging in a constructive and pragmatic spirit to address
issues impacting citizens of all three countries and the world
community. The U.S. administration should understand the risks of
driving Russia and China closer and explore ways to engage with both
countries so as to diffuse the perception that the United States sees no
alternative to future major power war. In the past, relationships among
Presidents have been pivotal in advancing the U.S.-Soviet/Russia arms
control agenda. The fact that the U.S. and Russian presidents do not
communicate and China's president has been reluctant to meet with the
U.S. president presents a major obstacle for advancing an arms control
agenda. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China in June
2023 was promising in terms of generating dialogue on the U.S.-China
bilateral agenda, but Biden's reference to Xi as a "dictator" upon
Blinken's return from China elicited angry reactions from Beijing.
Presuming that it might be possible to resume dialogue and negotiations
on nuclear security at some point, it would of course be important to
approach discussions with realistic aspirations and low expectations.
This is a process that will require highly skilled diplomats with
commitment, patience, and capacity to recognize the stakes and risks of
failure. All parties must appreciate that there is no winning a war
among nuclear powers and the United States, Russia, and China would
benefit by strengthening commitment to exhausting all diplomatic options
for avoiding conflict and rapid termination of kinetic clashes. Pledges
like "fighting until the last Ukrainian" or promulgating protracted wars
will not bode well for nuclear arms control and avoiding catastrophic
loss of life that should be unacceptable to all. Engaging in discussions
on crisis avoidance, crisis management, and implementing safeguards to
prevent misperceptions that could result in nuclear use would be obvious
priorities. Reliable communication channels among the three nations will
be essential for managing clashes and ensuring that intentions are clear
in any crisis situation. In current circumstances in which nuclear
threats have been issued over the conflict in Ukraine, [[the **risk**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a [regional conflict [**escalating** to
nuclear]{.mark} use]{.underline} should be clear. Perhaps considering a
tripartite no first-use option would provide an objective that the three
nations could work to accomplish. Recent serious U.S. bilateral clashes
with both Russia and China only underscore the importance for
continually reviewing arms control and deterrence strategies to adjust
to rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances. Entering into dialogue
on nuclear security would help the three parties to gain better
understanding of the capabilities and intentions of the others. Russia
has agreed to abide by the New START limits on numbers of deployed
long-range nuclear forces. The United States and Russia might consider
agreeing to reductions in order to incentivize China's cooperation.
Destabilization of major nuclear power collaboration will undermine
successes of the nuclear non-proliferation regime as several nations
will only be more determined to acquire nuclear capacity in response to
changing and strained geopolitical circumstances. In the past, although
the United States has been able to collaborate with Russia and China on
issues such as engaging Iran in nuclear negotiations, reigning in the
North Korean nuclear threat, and achieving successes in nuclear
nonproliferation, [the risk of uncontrolled
**proliferation**]{.underline} among both state and non-state actors
[[will only **increase**]{.mark} if the three countries are not able to
manage]{.underline} geopolitical [strains]{.underline}. Given the
[**longstanding** U.S.-Soviet/Russia **experience** and prior
**successes** in nuclear arms control]{.underline}, it would be wise to
build on this foundation and experience [while **reaching** out to bring
**China**]{.underline} into a major nuclear power triad. Simultaneously,
it would be important to [strengthen multilateral
negotiations]{.underline} in nuclear security among P5 countries while
perhaps broadening dialogue with other nuclear nations regarding
safeguards necessary for developments in artificial intelligence and
other areas. These measures toward preventing a nuclear arms race,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and avoiding nuclear first
use will certainly be difficult to implement at this juncture. However,
such steps would serve the interests of the United States, Russia, and
China and [**enhance** security of the global **community**]{.underline}
and should be among the highest priorities for the world's leading
nuclear powers.

However, over a period of time starting roughly from the turn of the
millennium, the painfully crafted [**[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline} (NAC) [instruments
have been **withering**]{.underline} away. In fact, the [US and Russia
currently [stand at]{.mark} the **delicate [threshold]{.mark}** where
their bilateral nuclear arms control is [held]{.mark} together
[by]{.mark} the **slender [thread]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **only** the
**[New START]{.mark}** Treaty. [This]{.mark} too [could
**snap**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021 unless the two sides agree to
extend the treaty. Signs of this happening at the time of this writing
appear quite unclear. On the other hand, [what looks **absolutely
clear** is]{.underline} the rather [**grim** nuclear arms control
scenario [as]{.mark} **old [mechanisms]{.mark}** [fade out]{.mark} and
**no new ones** are in sight]{.underline}. USA and Russia are going
through a low phase in their relationship and neither is showing any
interest in engaging on nuclear issues. Meanwhile, the number of nuclear
players has increased from only these two. Multiple [nuclear
dyads]{.underline} ([[**US**-**Russia**]{.mark}, US-**[China]{.mark}**,
US-[**DPRK**, **China-India**,]{.mark}
**India-[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [and the
**[spillover]{.mark}** of developments in capability taking place in
each dyad onto the other, [creating]{.mark} nuclear **[chain
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is a new phenomenon. To further
exacerbate the situation, [**[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies are
**[threatening]{.mark}** to intersect]{.underline} with nuclear
deterrence [[in novel ways]{.mark} and **none** of the]{.underline}
nuclear armed [states is showing **any inclination** to
manage]{.underline} these develop- ments or even acknowledge the need
for doing so. Lastly, a further complication is being created by the
re-emergence of old ideas, such as those of low yield weapons for
nuclear war fighting, or of limited nuclear war. These concepts had long
ago been abandoned as unfeasible and dangerous, but they seem to be
staging a comeback into nuclear doctrines. The [result]{.underline} of
all these developments [is a complex and **extremely stressed** global
**nuclear conundrum**]{.underline} with severe regional implications.
New Delhi is one capital that has traditionally been far away from the
world of arms control. As a non-nuclear weapons possessor until 1998,
and as a country that actively campaigned for the complete elimination
of nuclear weapons as a way of safeguarding its national security, India
considered bilateral NAC between the US and USSR/Russia as one way,
though not necessarily an optimal way, of eventually moving towards
nuclear disarmament. It was perceived as a mechanism that had a largely
bilateral significance but which, never- theless, helped reduce nuclear
risks, arrested the offence-defence cycle and hence had a benign
influence on international security. However, New Delhi was always
conscious of the fact that China, whose nuclear capability impinged on
its security, was not party to any such controls. Yet, the hope was
sustained that the nuclear threat from China would be addressed through
universal nuclear disarmament, realised through the Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT). This hope, however, was dashed when the NPT was granted an
indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. Meanwhile, around the
same time, pressures on India to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) as a non-nuclear weapon state increased. Keeping its security
compulsions in view, India felt pressured to demonstrate its own nuclear
weapons capability and establish nuclear deterrence. But, in the
process, India's faith in the ability of bilateral arms control or
multilateral non-proliferation instruments to attain nuclear disarmament
was lost. Since the possession of nuclear weapons, [[India]{.mark} is
**more [awake]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the more realistic
utility of [**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol
as an arms race **management** instrument]{.underline} or a risk
reduction instrument. It is for this reason that the [**ongoing**
[developments]{.mark} in NAC should **[matter]{.mark}** for India, [even
if these are]{.mark} taking place [in]{.mark} the **US-[Russia]{.mark}**
[bilateral]{.mark} **[domain]{.mark}**. They do impact the global
**nuclear order**, will have implications for **China**, and thereby
also on **India**]{.underline}. Whether the future trajectory of NAC
will result in positive consequences or adverse ones for New Delhi will
depend on many factors, including how these are handled. This article
highlights four main issues that will have implications at the global
and regional levels, for India in particular. Loss of an NAC model [The
**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline}
arrangements [[between]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
USSR/**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most of which were underwritten
by verification mechanisms, [[presented]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves
as [a [**template** for others]{.mark} to **follow**. They could be
described as a **model**]{.underline} (even if less than adequate from
the disarmament point of view) [or an **anchor** of successful arms race
**management**]{.underline} and their effective implementation [provided
an [**incentive** for other]{.mark} **nuclear [dyads]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}to adopt and adapt]{.underline}. In the current circumstances,
however, the abandonment of most of these bilateral treaties has led to
the loss of an example or mould of nuclear arms control that could have
been used bilaterally or multilaterally. While a copy of the written
text of the agreement would, of course, be always available, [the
**spirit** seems **lost**]{.underline}. The historical experience of how
to arrive at such agreements in an atmosphere of deep mistrust would be
lost eventually too, [as the **habit** of nuclear engagement **fades
away** in the case of US and Russia]{.underline}, even before it has
been born in the case of other nuclear dyads. Therefore, [despite all
its **imperfections**, the NAC]{.underline} architecture [was a
**framework** whose loss will have **implications** for international
**security**]{.underline}. Presence of Nuclear Cacophony [The
[**vacuum** created by]{.mark} the [loss]{.mark} of NAC has been [filled
by]{.mark} an atmosphere of 'free for all' or **nuclear
[cacophony]{.mark}** that is [allowing]{.mark} a **free [run]{.mark}**
[towards]{.mark} an **[offence]{.mark}-defence
[spiral]{.mark}**]{.underline} as countries pursue the concept of
absolute security. The idea of mutual vulnerability that underwrote
nuclear deterrence, and which sought to be enshrined through the NAC,
appears to be a casualty of the process. This can be prominently seen in
the context of US-Russia and US- China threat perceptions of one another
and their consequent capability build up. Russia and China have long
expressed their concern about how the US ballistic missile defence (BMD)
would undercut their nuclear deterrence. To address the perceived
instability that would be so created, [they have moved ahead
with]{.underline} the deployment of [**MIRVed** missiles]{.underline},
cruise missiles, [and]{.underline} the development of hypersonic glide
vehicles (**[HGV]{.underline}**) to defeat the BMD.

Times; New York Times, "The Risk of Nuclear Conflict is Rising,"
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/07/opinion/nuclear-war-prevention.html\]

At the heart of all of this work is a [**chilling** conclusion: The
[possibility of]{.mark} a **nuclear [strike]{.mark}**, once
**inconceivable**]{.underline} in modern conflict, [[is more likely
**now** than]{.mark} at **[any other time]{.mark}** since the **Cold
War**. "We\'ve had 30 pretty **success**ful years keeping the **genie in
the bottle**]{.underline}," a senior administration official on the
Tiger Team said. While both America and Russia have hugely reduced their
nuclear arsenals since the height of the Cold War, the official said,
"Right now is when nuclear risk is most at the forefront." Russian
President Vladimir Putin [**reminded** the world of this
[**existential** danger]{.mark}]{.underline} last week when he publicly
warned of nuclear war if NATO deepened its involvement in Ukraine. [The
risk of **nuc**lear escalation [in **Ukraine**,]{.mark} while **now
low**, has been]{.underline} a primary **[concern]{.underline}** for the
Biden administration throughout the conflict, details of which are being
reported here for the first time. In a series of interviews over the
past year, U.S. and Ukrainian officials spoke on condition of anonymity
to discuss internal planning, diplomacy and ongoing security
preparations. And while it may cause sleepless nights in Washington and
Kyiv, most of the world has barely registered the threat. Perhaps it's
because an entire generation came of age in a post-Cold War world, when
the possibility of nuclear war was thought to be firmly behind us. It is
time to remind ourselves of the consequences in order to avoid them.
\<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> EVEN AFTER LAST week's nuclear threat, few
believe that Mr. Putin will wake up one day and decide to lob megaton
warheads at Washington or European capitals in retaliation for
supporting Ukraine. What Western allies see as more likely is that
Russia will use a so-called tactical nuclear weapon, which is less
destructive and designed to strike targets over short distances to
devastate military units on the battlefield. The strategic thinking
behind those weapons is that they are far less damaging than
city-destroying hydrogen bombs and therefore more "usable" in warfare.
The United States estimates Russia has a stockpile of up to 2,000
tactical nuclear warheads, some small enough they fit in an artillery
shell. But the detonation of any tactical nuclear weapon would be an
unprecedented test of the dogma of deterrence, a theory that has
underwritten America's military policy for the past 70 years. The idea
stipulates that adversaries are deterred from launching a nuclear attack
against the United States --- or more than 30 of its treaty-covered
allies --- because by doing so they risk an overwhelming counterattack.
Possessing nuclear weapons isn't about winning a nuclear war, the theory
goes; it's about preventing one. It hinges upon a carefully calibrated
balance of terror among nuclear states. \<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> IF MR.
PUTIN dropped a nuclear weapon on Ukraine --- a nonnuclear nation that's
not covered by anyone's nuclear umbrella --- what then? If deterrence
fails, how is it possible to reduce the risk of one attack escalating
into a global catastrophe? We might find an answer in the autumn of
2022, when fears of Russia's nuclear use in Ukraine were most palpable.
A lightning Ukrainian military counteroffensive had reclaimed territory
from the Russians in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The Ukrainians
were on the cusp of breaching Russian defense lines at Kherson in the
south, possibly causing a second Russian retreat that could signal an
imminent broader military collapse. U.S. intelligence estimated that if
Ukraine's fighters managed to break through Russian defenses --- and
were on the march to the occupied Crimean Peninsula, where the Russian
Black Sea Fleet is based --- it came down to a coin flip whether or not
Russia would launch a tactical nuclear weapon to stop them, senior
administration officials said. Moscow has made implicit and explicit
nuclear threats throughout the war to scare off Western intervention.
Around this time, however, a series of frightening episodes took place.
On Oct. 23, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu of Russia made a flurry of
phone calls to the defense chiefs of four NATO nations, including
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, to say Russia had indications that
Ukrainian fighters could detonate a dirty bomb --- a conventional
explosive wrapped in radioactive material --- on their own territory to
frame Moscow. American intelligence also intercepted chatter around then
among Russian military leaders about using a tactical nuclear weapon,
according to current and former Biden administration officials. General
Austin and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, held
three phone calls in four days with Russian counterparts during this
tense period. Believing the Russians were building an unfounded pretext
for their own nuclear attack, the Biden administration quickly began a
multilateral effort with allies, adversaries and nations in between to
de-escalate the situation and try to talk Moscow out of it. For nearly a
week, Biden aides pulled all-nighters at the White House, coordinating
high-level conversations and planning for the worst: the detonation of a
small nuclear device in Ukrainian territory that had the power of a few
kilotons or less. Many in the administration believed the Kremlin's
dirty bomb ploy posed the greatest risk of nuclear war since the 1962
Cuban missile crisis. State Department officials traveled to Poland to
ensure that medical supplies and radiation equipment were rushed over
the border. The Energy Department sent equipment to collect potential
debris so that it could be later analyzed by American scientists for
weapon design characteristics and the origin of the nuclear material.
U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear operations, directed a
team of experts (cheekily named The Writers' Club, because their
findings were written up daily for the Pentagon leadership) to assess
the risk and determine which conditions would trigger Russia to go
nuclear. While cautions about the potential withering economic,
diplomatic and military consequences were delivered in private to
Moscow, administration officials also publicly sounded alarm bells. The
administration's diplomatic push was coupled with efforts by leaders of
several nations, including China, India and Turkey, to explain to Mr.
Putin's government the potential costs if he were to go through with a
nuclear attack. That November, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, William J. Burns, met with his Russian counterpart in Turkey,
where he conveyed a similar warning. On Nov. 16, the Group of 20
released a joint statement: If the Russian leader was indeed inching
toward the brink, he stepped back. WHAT TOOK PLACE to prevent a nuclear
attack that fall was a rare moment of consensus on an issue on which
world leaders seem to be moving farther apart. Russia is replacing its
Soviet-era hardware with new jets, missiles and submarines. And the
other eight nations that have nuclear weapons are believed to be
enhancing their arsenals in parts of the world that are already on edge.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has continuing tensions over its
borders with China and Pakistan, [is [fielding
**longer**]{.mark}**-range** [weapons. **Pakistan**]{.mark} is
[developing **new** **b**]{.mark}allistic **[m]{.mark}**issiles and
expanding nuclear **production** facilities. **[North
Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which has an arsenal of several hundred
missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, regularly [**threatens** to
attack South Korea]{.underline}, where the U.S. keeps about 28,500
troops. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has publicly expressed
its desire to control the U.S.-allied island of Taiwan by force if
necessary, [is **increasing** its nuclear **arsenal**]{.underline} at a
"scale and pace unseen since the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race that
ended in the late 1980s," the Congressional Commission on the Strategic
Posture of the United States concluded in October. So while Washington
has been helping Ukraine prepare for a nuclear attack, [[**Taiwan**
or]{.mark} **South [Korea]{.mark}** could be **next**]{.underline}. The
National Security Council has already coordinated contingency playbooks
for possible [conflicts]{.underline} that [[could turn **nuclear**
in]{.mark} **Taiwan**, the **Korea**n Peninsula and the [**Middle
East**. **Iran**]{.mark}, which has [**continued** its
**nuc**]{.mark}lear [program amid **Israel**'s war]{.mark} on Hamas in
**Gaza**, has [amassed **enough**]{.mark} enriched **uranium** [to
build]{.mark} several **[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} if and when it
chooses. During this time of widening conflict, the rising nuclear
threat is especially destabilizing: A nuclear explosion in Ukraine or
Gaza, where tens of thousands of civilians have already been killed or
injured, would sizeably escalate either conflict and its humanitarian
toll. The world has been through a version of this moment before. The
last nuclear standoff during the Cold War was cooled in part because of
numerous nonproliferation efforts and arms control agreements between
the United States and the former Soviet Union. The two nations,
recognizing the terrifying situation they were in, worked to identify
weapons that were mutually menacing and simply agreed to eliminate them.
Nuclear warhead numbers plummeted to 12,500 today from roughly 70,400 in
1986. [Now that shared **[safety]{.mark} net** [of
**treaties**]{.mark}]{.underline} and agreements [[is **nearly
gone**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After a decade of diplomatic breakdown and
military antagonism, [**[only one]{.mark}** major arms treaty between

[remains]{.mark} --- **New [START]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which Mr.

States and Russia deploy. Already today, because of the New START
suspension, the two nations disclose little information about their
arsenals to each other and do not engage in talks for further
agreements. [[If]{.mark} nuclear **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing COVID 19 disease, has
taught us unexpected lessons about the dangers of human extinction
through highly contagious and lethal diseases. As the COVID 19 pandemic
is now being controlled by various isolation measures, therapeutics and
vaccines, it became clear that our current lifestyle and societal
functions may not be sustainable in the long term. [We]{.underline} now
[have to start thinking and planning on how to face [the next]{.mark}
dangerous [pandemic]{.mark}, not just overcoming the one that is upon us
now.]{.underline} Is there any evidence that **[[even worse]{.mark}
pandemics could strike us]{.underline}** in the near future and
[threaten the existence of the human race]{.underline}? The answer is
unequivocally yes. It is not necessary to get infected by viruses of
bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that live in remote forests in
order to be in danger. [Creditable **scientific evidence**
indicates]{.underline} that the human [[gut]{.mark} microbiota **[harbor
billions of viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [which are capable of
affecting the function of **vital** human **organs** such as the immune
system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.]{.underline} It is
possible that the development of [pathogenic variants]{.underline} in
the gut **[[can]{.mark} lead to contagious viruses]{.underline}** [which
can [cause **pandemics**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leading to destruction
of vital organs]{.underline}, [causing death or various debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and
kidney]{.underline} failures. [These diseases could **[result in]{.mark}
the complete shutdown of**]{.underline} our
**[civilization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} probably the
**[[extinction]{.mark} of human race]{.underline}**. In this essay, I
will first provide a few independent pieces of scientific facts and then
combine this information to come up with some (but certainly not all)
hypothetical scenarios that could cause human race misery, even
extinction. I hope that these scary scenarios will trigger preventative
measures that could reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes. 1.
Introduction Le Chatelier's Principle: Named after the French chemist,
Le Chatelier's principle posits that "When an external stress (change in
pressure, temperature or concentration) is applied to a system in
chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium will change in such a way as to
reduce the effect of the stress." In other words, a change in a system
will evoke a counter-change, which will bring the equilibrium to a new
point. This principle operates with almost every human or other
activity. For example, it is known that when fruit production in the
Serengeti ecosystem is reduced, the number of elephants, which feed on
these fruits, is reduced proportionally. In the context of this essay, I
hypothesize that human-made changes in climate, the atmosphere, water,
soil, and all other planet-living organisms, will likely evoke
counter-changes that may be highly consequential to human life. Due to
the complexity of our ecosystem, humans do not know exactly how these
changes will affect them in the end. Consequently, they choose to
disregard them because lifestyle adjustments may cost money and
convenience or loss of well-established pleasures. 1.1. The earth is
changing rapidly What is changing on the earth that could induce a
potentially catastrophic counter-change? The answer is everything is
changing , from the living inhabitants (humans, other species, and
plants) to the atmosphere, water, soil, climate, among else. The changes
caused by human activity are sometimes dramatic. For example, it has
been estimated that about 1 million out of 8.5 million species of
plants, animals, and other organisms are in imminent danger of
extinction \[1\]. Other estimates show that 50% of the organisms that
existed 50 years ago have already gone extinct, not to consider
additional species that are gone before we even identify them. Soon, we
will likely be losing more than 80% of the world's species due to human
overdevelopment and its associated consequences. The major reasons for
species extinction are habitat destruction, pesticide poisoning, and
illegal hunting \[1\]. 2. Global warming Some may choose to believe what
the politicians are debating about: that climate change is a fact or
fiction, but the data say that the last 6 years were the warmest on
record \[2\]. Overall, the planet was 1.25°C warmer than in
preindustrial times (in the 1950s). Warmer oceans are melting ice sheets
and rising sea levels by almost 5 mm per year. In Australia,
record-setting heat and drought were responsible for the bushfires that
destroyed almost 25% of southeastern Australia's forests and their
living inhabitants, such as koalas. If we cannot slow down earth's
heating by reducing emissions, the current increase of about 0.2°C per
decade will likely be rapidly surpassed. How will the planet react?
Likely with more catastrophic fires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and floods.
The human homeostatic changes to increased temperatures are very complex
and include many vital organs \[3\]. Global warming may also cause
changes in the biology of our candidate foes, the viruses, bacteria, and
parasites that live in our gut and skin (see Section 2.2). 2.1. How much
human-made environmental damage has been done already? Humans are now
the undisputed masters of the planet and cannot be easily stopped from
actively destroying it, consciously or unconsciously. An interesting
question is how much damage has been claimed to be done already, and do
we have the data to support these claims? Elhacham et al. have recently
compared the natural biomass that exists on the earth with the
human-made (anthropogenic) mass \[4\]. They found that each person on
the globe produces a mass that is about equal to their body weight every
week! Is that too little or too much? Let us first define biomass and
anthropogenic mass. The majority of the earth's biomass is represented
by trees and bushes. The majority of the man-made mass is represented by
buildings and infrastructure such as roads and consists of concrete,
bricks, asphalt, metals, and plastic. Just consider that the total
global mass of produced plastic so far is greater than the overall mass
of all terrestrial and marine animals combined! So, how do we fare when
comparing biomass to anthropogenic mass production? In the 1900s, the
latter represented only 3% of global biomass; but now, in the 2020s, the
two masses are about equal. The projection is that if we go on with more
deforestation, buildings, streets, plastics, cars, and so on, by 2040,
it is likely that anthropogenic mass will almost triple the earth's
biomass. Will there be enough resources and clean air and water to
sustain the life of the projected 9 billion inhabitants? Anthropogenic
mass production is difficult to slow down since this activity is
considered part of our evolving civilization and way of living. 2.2.
Human microbiome The human body consists of approximately 30 trillion
cells, but the microbiota population in the human gut is estimated to be
300 trillion \[5\]! In addition, there is another microbiota in the skin
and other organs. It was initially thought that these microbiota act
locally (e.g., only in the gut or skin), but new evidence suggest that
the effects of microbiota may be global, reaching every cell in the
body. This can be achieved with various mechanisms, one being the
transmission of signals mediated by proteins that can travel through
anatomically distinct structures such as the vagus nerve. For example, a
protein called curli can travel through the vagus nerve and reach the
brain, where it can promote abnormal aggregation of proteins such as
a-synuclein, one major pathogenetic player in Parkinson's disease
\[5,6\]. Another and even more likely mechanism includes the diffusion
of bacterial or viral proteins (some could be toxins to various organs)
or pathogenic viruses into the bloodstream. From there, they can travel
around the body. This is reminiscent of cancer cell metastasis by the
hematogenous route. One piece of evidence for that happening is that
about half of the human metabolome (the collection of all metabolites in
the blood) is derived by host bacteria \[5\]. Bacteria or virus-derived
metabolites could also pass through the placenta and reach the fetus,
including the fetal brain, possibly causing diseases such as autism.
Despite skin not being as hospitable to microorganisms as the gut, a
typical person may have about 1,000 species of bacteria on their skin
\[7\]. These microbial communities continue to grow and diversify until
puberty when hormonal and developmental changes reach a plateau. The
balance between host and bacteria in the skin is determined by the
production of skin-derived microbial nutrients, microbiome-derived skin
nutrients, skin, and microbiome-derived antimicrobial peptides, and by
the interaction of the microbiome with the host's immune system. Similar
as in the gut, there is a delicate balance between beneficial and
potentially harmful bacteria and the host immune system. It is remotely
possible that our future enemies may derive from the gut, skin, or other
organs harboring microorganisms. In addition, the skin is more sensitive
to environmental changes such as climate change as it is directly
exposed to the environment. In conclusion, bacterial, viral, and
parasite-derived proteins or [pathogenic viruses]{.underline} thrive
locally (e.g., in the gut or skin) but [are [capable of]{.mark}
**[acting globally.]{.mark}**]{.underline} 2.3. Human viruses and how
they could cause disease [Many strains]{.underline} of gut bacteria are
harmless, but they [can become **dangerous pathogens**]{.underline}
[under certain conditions, such as **antibiotic use**]{.underline}
\[8\]. It is well known that gut bacteria can harbor many viruses
(bacterial phages) \[9\]. If they do not immediately kill the infected
bacteria, these viruses incorporate into the bacterial genome and stay
latent for extended periods (they are known "prophages"). These
prophages can be reactivated under certain environmental or other
factors and act like pathogenic viruses. It is rather surprising that,
in general, viruses are so many that they qualify as the most abundant
biological entities on the planet. Sometimes, gut bacteria use their
activated prophages as weapons to gain an advantage and kill other
competing bacteria. Phages could also assist in bacterial evolution as
the latter become more virulent \[10\]. The gut bacteria also seem to
interact with the host immune system and can influence the efficacy of
cancer immunotherapy \[11,12,13\]. The microbiome has been blamed for
playing direct or indirect roles in many human diseases, including
cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dementia, and others \[14\]. The
outcomes regarding health and disease depend on the balance of powers
among the gut/skin/other organ viruses, the gut/skin/other organ
microbiomes, and the host immune system. If this balance is disturbed, a
biological war between these players will be initiated, and the outcome
will be unpredictable. In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the
idea that phages in the mammalian intestine, skin, or elsewhere, not
only can be engulfed by certain eukaryotic cells but also might escape
from the gut or skin, enter the bloodstream, and make their way into
other parts of the body, with as yet undiscovered consequences. 2.4.
Viral variants [[Viruses evolve]{.mark} **continuously**]{.underline},
eventually [[leading to more **transmissible
variants**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline} sometimes [can be
more **lethal**]{.underline} than the original strains. The SARS-CoV-2
is an excellent contemporary example. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2
are rapidly spreading and are becoming dominant in certain geographic
areas \[15,16\]. For example, the B.1.1.7 variant (United Kingdom) has
23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; variant 501Y.V2 (South Africa)
has 23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; and P.1 variant (Brazil) has
approximately 35 mutations with 17 amino acid changes. In April 2021,
when this document was first written, I speculated verbatim that "new
variants with additional mutations could become able to evade our
currently available vaccines by weakening the ability of vaccine-induced
antibodies to neutralize/block viral entry, and by strengthening the
ability of the virus to enter the cells via surface receptors." The
so-called "omicron variant," isolated in November 2021, already
fulfilled this prediction. 2.5. How COVID-19 and possibly other viruses
affect the brain In general, viral invasion of the central nervous
system may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic
transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve,
infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the
blood--brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells via
transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding
and a subsequent proteolytic event, facilitated by transmembrane
protease serine 2 \[17\]. Is there evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can enter
the brain? The answer is yes \[18\]. As already mentioned, one route is
by migrating from the cribriform plate along the olfactory tract \[19\]
or through vagal pathways. Another route may include viral entry into
brain capillary endothelial cells via the ACE2 pathway. Viral RNA was
detected in the medulla and cerebellum by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. However, viral proteins seem to
be absent from neurons and glial cells. Consequently, the adverse events
of the virus on the brain, including altered neurotransmission and
neuronal damage, are likely mediated by neuroinflammation and hypoxic
injury through cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators. 2.6.
SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses can affect the senses Viruses can
affect our senses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia (loss of
smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) in 40--70% of COVID-19 patients
\[20\]. These effects persist, but it is unknown for how long. Other
neurological symptoms include headache, stroke, impairment of
consciousness, seizure, anxiety, and encephalopathy. Current evidence
suggests that SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia may be a new viral syndrome
specific to COVID-19. This syndrome is likely mediated by intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into the olfactory neural circuitry. Since the
olfactory sensory neurons do not express ACE2 receptor, the likely
explanation for the loss of smell is the damage of accessory cells
supporting these neurons. Although anosmia is not a lethal or severe
disease, other neurological damage such as blindness could be
devastating \[21,22\]. 3 Adverse scenarios Fifty years ago, [one adverse
scenario regarding a pandemic was **presented**]{.underline} in the film
"The Andromeda strain," which describes a pandemic caused by a pathogen
of extraterrestrial origin \[23\]. Here, I present an alternative
hypothetical scenario that involves an endogenous virus. Obviously,
[there is a **myriad** of similar scenarios]{.underline}, and [the one
given]{.underline} below can be currently classified as fictional but
**[not impossible]{.underline}**. A prophage, which was residing dormant
for years in the genome of the commensal gut bacterium Bifidobacterium
infantis suddenly, and without an apparent reason, has undergone
induction and started to produce viral proteins, which were subsequently
assembled into whole phages. After cell lysis, these phages infected
other neighboring cells. This cycle was repeated many times, and
millions of free virions were released, some entering the systemic
circulation (viremia). Some virions reached the lung endothelium and
entered the endothelial cells through an, as yet, unknown receptor and
started replicating and lysing these cells. The resulting mucous caused
the host to cough, thus facilitating the transfer of the virus to other
humans through aerosol droplets. Soon, the virus was able to infect,
first a few hundred, then thousands, then millions of other unsuspected
people through coughing and sneezing. The virus was able to travel all
over the world as the pulmonary manifestations were mild, and most
infected individuals thought it was a common flu or a similar ailment.
[Scientists isolated the virus that caused this]{.underline} flu-like
[disease and determined]{.underline} from its genomic sequence that [it
was a novel member of influenza]{.underline} virus B, which usually
causes seasonal flu. [Despite the **pandemic**]{.underline} nature of
the infection, [nobody died]{.underline}, [and governmental bodies were
not]{.underline} highly [concerned]{.underline}. [Six months
later]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} individual [reported a weakening
of his vision]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, within 3 months,
[progressed to **total** blindness]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
unusual form of blindness [quickly spread to other people]{.underline}
until scientists performed epidemiological studies, which linked the
blindness to the previously mentioned mild flu. Soon afterward,
scientists isolated and identified the virus from the brains of blind
and subsequently succumbed individuals and confirmed that the sequence
matched the virus that caused the unusual flu. More elaborate studies
had shown that there was unusual and very severe neuroinflammation
around the occipital lobe of the brain (Brodmann area 17), an area
responsible for the interpretation of visual signals arriving from the
optic nerve. Several therapeutics were tried, but none was proven to be
effective. [Twelve months into the pandemic]{.underline}, **[10
million]{.underline}** people **[lost their vision]{.underline}**, [and
within 18 months]{.underline}, without any success in developing
therapies or a vaccine, [the blindness had spread to]{.underline}
**[whole nations]{.underline}**. 3.1 Blindness The selection of
blindness as a chronic consequence of an acute pandemic was deliberate.
In 1995, Portuguese author Jose Saramago published a fictional novel
entitled "Blindness" (ISBN: 9780151002511), which contributed to him
winning the Nobel Prize in literature in 1998. Blindness, as portrayed
in the book, is a highly detailed story of a mysterious mass
**[epidemic]{.underline}** [that [caused]{.mark}]{.underline} blindness
of a whole nation and the **[[social breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that followed. [The]{.underline} blindness [pandemic]{.underline}, in
many respects, [is reminiscent of]{.underline} the current
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic. Blindness [caused]{.underline}
widespread **[panic, anarchy, and government lockdowns]{.underline}**.
The life of the blind people was characterized by filthiness, aggressive
manners, disrespect of others, and a struggle to survive by any possible
means. The [breakdown]{.underline} of society [was]{.underline} near
**[total]{.underline}**. [Law and order, social services,
government]{.underline}, schools could **[no longer
function]{.underline}**. Families have been separated and could not find
one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food.
[Violence, disease, and despair]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}**
to overwhelm **[human coping]{.underline}**. One of Saramago's quotes,
describing life after blindness, is reproduced here "Perhaps humanity
will manage to live without eyes, but then it will cease to be humanity,
the result is obvious..." 3.2 Other ailments Acute
[pandemics]{.underline} could [cause]{.underline} many other **[chronic
diseases]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} can [threaten]{.underline}
the [sustainability]{.underline} of our present society. Although
COVID-19 causes loss of smell and taste, these are considered
nonlife-threatening ailments. However, in the long run, the permanent
absence of smell and taste will mean the loss of innumerable current
pleasures associated with the consumption of food and drinks. Clearly,
loss of hearing will not be compatible with current societal functions
or human achievements. [Acute viral diseases are]{.underline} also
[associated with innumerable]{.underline} **[[organ-specific
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such as heart, kidney, and reproductive
failures and disturbance of other vital functions that can]{.underline}
~~paralyze~~ \[[[hamstring]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [our current
[society,]{.mark} economy, and culture]{.underline}. Even a minor
weakening of our memory (mild cognitive impairment) could [result
in]{.underline} **[chaotic situations]{.underline}** that authors of
fiction, such as Saramago, attempt to describe in detail in future
books. 3.3 Epilog [Humans]{.underline} have learned to [take for granted
what they]{.underline} currently [have]{.underline} and enjoy. Perhaps,
we did not realize that [the human race's]{.underline} spectacular
[advances are dependent on several]{.underline} potentially volatile
[abilities]{.underline} (senses, brain function) [and that]{.underline}
even one loss, or diminution of such abilities, [could be]{.underline}
**[detrimental, [causing]{.mark} a [collapse of]{.mark} our
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic helped us
realize that [we may be sitting on a **time bomb**]{.underline}, [which
might]{.underline} **[explode]{.underline}** if we continue disturbing
the current equilibrium between humans and other planetary partners. In
addition to viruses of a rather exotic origin, such as SARS-CoV-2,
billions of other viruses and other infectious agents in our gut, skin,
and elsewhere are waiting for the right time to attack us. The lessons
learned from COVID-19 should be a wake-up call for humans to stop
disturbing the equilibrium with actions that favor the well-being of
humans but put in danger the existence of other inhabitants of planet
earth. Human [migration]{.underline}, also known as "travel," has
[facilitated the travel of our **foes**]{.underline}, along with us, [in
**every**]{.underline} conceivable [corner of the world]{.underline}.
Finally, yet, importantly, artists are always ahead of scientists in
seeing things coming. On this occasion, the rock band R.E.M. released a
song 30 years ago entitled "**[It's [the end of the world as we know
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and I feel fine)." They are likely not far
off their prediction!

1\. Introduction Despite recent social protests and climate emergency
declarations, [efforts to mitigate climate change to date are
**insufficient**]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[emissions continue to rise and global [warming **above 3
°**]{.mark}**C** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[increasingly
[likely]{.mark} this century]{.underline}**.2 [There is emerging
evidence of]{.underline} amplifying [[feedbacks
**accelerating**]{.underline}]{.mark}3 and dampening feedbacks
decelerating.4 These [feedbacks [exacerbate]{.mark} the possibility of
**[runaway]{.mark}** global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline},5 [estimated
at **8 °C**]{.underline} [or greater]{.underline} by 2100.6 Such
temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers,7 shifting
the narrow climate niche within which humans have resided for
millennia.8 Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is
concern that the [effects of ﻿ [climate change]{.mark} may [pose an ﻿
**existential risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline}, one
[that threatens "**societal collapse**" or]{.underline} even
**[extinction]{.underline}**.9 Understanding these worst-case scenarios
is essential for good risk management.10 Improving awareness of
potential pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses such a risk can
help inform decision- making about interventions.11 Considering societal
impacts that are more tangible for individuals, businesses and
governments,12 and better ﻿ aligned with conventional risk priorities,13
may facilitate more effective action to mitigate ﻿ climate change.14 A
number of pathways through which ﻿ climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15 [Climate
change]{.underline} is predicted to [undermine **agricultural** systems
and [disrupt **food**]{.mark} **supply**]{.underline},16 [which may
[lead to **economic** shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[socio-
political]{.underline}** [[instability]{.mark} as well as
**starvation**]{.underline}, **[migration]{.underline}** [[and
conflict]{.mark} at local through to **global scale**]{.underline}.17
[While]{.underline} the [climate **science**]{.underline} underpinning
global warming estimates [is well established]{.underline},18 albeit
subject to sensitivities, the [uncertainties increase
**significantly**]{.underline} [when we]{.underline} start to
[consider]{.underline} these [tangible societal impacts]{.underline}
given the complex relationships involved.19 [Our understanding of
worst-case scenarios]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} particularly of
empirical evidence addressing the [causal pathways]{.underline} through
which ﻿ climate change may cause societal collapse, [is]{.underline}
**[underdeveloped]{.underline}**.20 In this chapter we aim to identify
and structure an empirical evidence base of the relationships between ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse. We do this using
Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system dynamics approach that is useful
for visualising the relationships between variables in a complex
system.21 This chapter is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review
the societal collapse and ﻿ existential risk literature to refine the aim
introduced above. In Section 3, we develop an original methodology to
establish a new empirical evidence base and create a novel-format CLD of
causal pathways between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. In
Section 4, we present and discuss the results from the application of
this methodology to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway of interest. We conclude, in Section 5, by
identifying avenues of future work that may build upon this chapter. 2.
Literature Review To refine the aim of this chapter, introduced in
Section 1, our review examines whether there is historical evidence of ﻿
climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse and to what extent
have causal pathways been documented to inform our understanding of ﻿
climate change as an existential threat to contemporary society. We
first define the terms "﻿ existential risk" and "societal collapse" as
used in this chapter. Adopting ﻿ Ord's definition, "an ﻿ existential risk
is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term
potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as societal collapse, or
complete destruction, such as extinction.22 Adopting Kemp's definition,
[societal collapse]{.underline} is an "enduring loss of ﻿ population,
identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it [may be **abrupt**
or gradual]{.underline}, [but is typically **rapid**]{.underline}
because it is notably transformative, [and may be experienced
by]{.underline} a local, national or [the **global community** of
people]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents a conceptual model of societal
collapse, synthesised from the broader literature, to provide further
contextual definition. [\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]]{.underline} The rise and
fall of civilisations has been documented since the earliest recordings
of history and is increasingly studied to inform our understanding of
societal collapse.24 We consider two types of historical studies that
provide insight into ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse
in the past. We note that other mechanisms are also discussed in the
literature, and there is debate about the role of different mechanisms
in particular societal collapse events. The first type of historical
study empirically investigates an individual societal collapse event
using primary sources, including anthropological, archaeological and
paleontological data. Based on such data analysis, natural ﻿ [climate
change has been]{.underline} asserted as [a mechanism of societal
collapse in]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** of these [case
studies]{.underline}, as established by de Menocal25 and Weiss and
Bradley.26 For example, Hodell et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and
Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse paleoclimate data alongside the
[archaeological record]{.underline} to [show]{.underline} that
[drought]{.underline} conditions, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to solar forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
Classic **[Maya]{.underline}** [civilisation]{.underline} of Mesoamerica
in \~8--10th century CE. Weiss et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et
al.32 show that [regional aridity]{.underline}, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to ﻿ volcanic forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse of]{.underline} multiple [societies
**across Mesopotamia**]{.underline}, including the Akkadian Empire in
\~22nd century BCE. Similarly, natural ﻿ [climate change has been
implicated in]{.underline} the [collapse of multiple Late Bronze Age
societies]{.underline} around the Mediterranean,33 [including
**Mycenaean** Kingdoms]{.underline} in \~12th century BCE,34 the
Harappan Civilization of South Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor
Empire of Southeast Asia in \~15th century CE,36 **[multiple Chinese
Dynasties]{.underline}**37 [and civilisations along the Silk
Road]{.underline}38 during the previous millennium, [the Norse
Vikings]{.underline} of Greenland in \~16th century AD,39 and the
Tiwanaku Empire of Pre- Columbian South America in \~10th century CE40
amongst others. This first type of studies establishes precedence of
natural ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout
history, demonstrating the risk that anthropogenic ﻿ climate change
similarly poses to contemporary society. However, the events examined
occurred more than 100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient
history, when societies were relatively isolated. Because these case
studies pre- date contemporary society, they do not provide empirical
evidence of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change in context of today's highly
interconnected society.41 Statistical evaluation of the frequency and
significance of natural ﻿ climate change relative to other mechanisms of
societal collapse identified across these case studies has not yet been
established within the literature. However, the second type of
historical study does qualitatively examine collections of these case
studies to develop theories of predominant modes of societal collapse.
Three major modes are observed, as follows. Fagan42 and McMichael43
focus on natural impact on the human system across multiple
civilisations, concluding that natural ﻿ climate change is predominant
having significantly influenced human existence throughout history.
[Over]{.underline} the past [12,000 years]{.underline}, the [natural and
human systems developed within the **stable climate niche**]{.underline}
[of the Holocene]{.underline} Epoch.44 The associated geographic
endowments governed human transition from band societies based on
foraging to complex societies based on agriculture. Unfavourable subtle
(e.g. weather variations) and drastic (e.g. natural disasters) shifts in
climate influenced the collapse of complex societies either by direct
loss of life or indirectly via resource insecurity. In particular, in
this mode, typically, the loss of agriculture led to de-﻿ population via
famine, migration or conflict due to food insecurity. Ponting,45
Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that human overpopulation and
overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of the environment is
predominant. [Societal collapse via environmental
degradation]{.underline} often [involved **unsustainable**]{.underline}
[agriculture]{.underline}, [exacerbated by]{.underline} natural ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}, [leading to de-﻿ population as well as
**institutional breakdown**]{.underline} [via loss of **economic
stability**]{.underline} [and socio-political
**dysfunction**]{.underline} due to magnified inequality.
[This]{.underline} mode [aligns with]{.underline} early "Malthusian ﻿
catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the commons",49 and "**[overshoot-and-
collapse]{.underline}**"50 theories. In their 12-volume magnum opus
exploring the rise and fall of 28 civilizations, Toynbee concludes that
"[great civilizations are not murdered]{.underline} \[[but]{.underline}
rather\] they [take their **own lives**]{.underline}."51 Building on
this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and Robinson,53 and Johnson54 focus on human
impact on the human system across multiple civilisations, concluding
that societal complexity in relation to problem-solving inability (e.g.
environmental degradation) and institutional dysfunction (e.g.
inequality and oligarchy internally, trade ally and hostile neighbour
relations externally) is predominant. As a society becomes more complex,
it reaches a point beyond which "continued investment in complexity as a
problem-solving strategy yields a declining marginal return" and it will
be at risk of collapsing under its own weight via institutional
breakdown and de-﻿ population.55 This mode aligns with "energy returned
on energy invested" theory,56 applied to explore societal collapse by
Homer-Dixon.57 Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and Schwartz and Nichols60 examine
why some civilisations have been able to thrive or recover, rather than
collapse. They similarly conclude that societies have flourished due to
combinations of favourable geographic endowment, managing their
existence within the carrying capacity of the natural system, and
co-operative action in problem-solving. This second type of studies
highlights that societal collapse involves a complex nexus of factors
and dynamically interlinked events. For instance, Gibbon details how all
three of the modes, described in the preceding five paragraphs,
contributed to the collapse of the ﻿ Roman Empire.61 These modes of
societal collapse, although based on empirical evidence pre-dating
contemporary society, describe key aspects of the anthropogenic ﻿ climate
change problem faced today. While these studies describe causal pathways
of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used CLDs to
untangle the complexity and give structure to the dense information in
this evidence base. Across these historical studies, we observe no
apparent temporal or spatial influence on the occurrence of societal
collapse. Rather, societal collapse has been described as occurring in
various forms, whether it be by known "white-swan" or surprise "black
swan" events,62 in different geographic locations and times throughout
history. Additionally, a quantitative statistical analysis by Arbesman
shows that societal collapse has occurred randomly and independent of
civilisation life- spans.63 These qualitative and quantitative
observations highlight that any society may be susceptible to collapse,
much in-line with the Red Queen Hypothesis of the Law of Extinction.
From these historical studies, we observe sets of secondary determinants
for each of the primary determinants introduced in Fig. 1, which are
defined in Fig. 2. Considering a geographically bounded society,
emigration refers to any permanent departure of ﻿ population including
both voluntary or forced migration, conflict mortality accounts for
deaths directly arising from any form of domestic or international
conflict (e.g. due to ﻿ war), and natural mortality accounts for deaths
related to domestic environmental conditions (e.g. due to famine). The
loss of socio-cultural norms, political structures or economic value
accounts for that which notably transforms the identity and institutions
of the society. [\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]]{.underline} In addition to these
historical studies, we consider the relatively nascent studies of
existential risks (X-risks) that provide insight into how ﻿ climate
change may trigger societal collapse in the future. Comprehensive
surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the collapse of
contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 ﻿ Rees,66 and Ord67 provide
eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the academic
literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many **historically**]{.underline}
[observed mechanisms of societal collapse]{.underline},
**[including]{.underline}** natural [﻿]{.underline} [climate
change]{.underline}, [remain applicable as X-risks today]{.underline}.
However, the ﻿ state of existence of contemporary society has led to a
different landscape in which these mechanisms apply, and to a number of
unprecedented mechanisms, including anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. ﻿
Ehrlich and ﻿ Ehrlich70 and Häggström71 note that [although [increased
**complexity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as globalisation and ﻿
tech]{.underline}nological advancement, [can increase a society's
**resilience** and **adaptability**]{.underline}, [it can also [increase
﻿**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, globalisation
increases resilience to local agricultural production shocks through
access to global markets; however, it also increases ﻿ vulnerability
through ﻿ exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such as trade
restrictions.72 Some **[geoengineering technologies]{.underline}**, for
example, [may enable society to mitigate]{.underline} and adapt to ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}; [however]{.underline}, [they
may]{.underline} also **[increase ﻿ vulnerability]{.underline}** [to ﻿
**termination shocks**]{.underline}, [where **failure**]{.underline} [of
the technology exposes society to **sudden temperature

humanity on a **global scale**]{.underline}. Works by Lynas,76
Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific ﻿ climate change
literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to worst-case
scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the natural
system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average
weather (e.g. [temperature]{.underline}) [and natural
disasters]{.underline} (e.g. floods) affected by ﻿ climate change [could
impact human mortality **directly**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
two effects, [coupled with sea level rise]{.underline} due to melting of
ice caps, [could indirectly impact human mortality via
degradation]{.underline} [of the natural world]{.underline} system
([e.g. land quality]{.underline}) [and the human world]{.underline}
system ([e.g. ﻿ **infrastructure failures**]{.underline}) [resulting in
**resource**]{.underline} and service **[insecurity]{.underline}**.
[This insecurity could impact **institutional stability**]{.underline},
[resulting in economic loss]{.underline}, [political dysfunction and
social **unrest**]{.underline}, [as well as migration and
**conflict**]{.underline}. The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary
society against the threat of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change range from
dystopian (collapse) to utopian (recovery). These futures studies
identify endpoints of different causal pathways between anthropogenic ﻿
climate change effects and potential impacts on the human world system,
with the latter reflecting key determinants of societal collapse
observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made limited in-roads
to empirically investigating the top-level relationships between some of
these endpoints using recent datasets. The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of mortality, conflict and migration
are, respectively, examined by Mora et al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer
et al.81 The feedback between migration and conflict driven by climate
change is examined by Abel et al.82 The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of economic loss, political instability
and shifts in cultural norms are examined by Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu
and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85 respectively. However, the complex
bottom-level links between and surrounding these endpoints are generally
ill understood,86 and the strength of empirical evidence is poorly
documented from a systems science perspective.87 To the best of our
knowledge, **[no study]{.underline}** has [empirically examined how the
impacts of ﻿ climate change could explicitly translate into societal
collapse for **contemporary** society]{.underline}. [We **do not have a
clear picture**]{.underline} [of ﻿ climate change as a ﻿ **systemic risk**
to our globalised society]{.underline}, particularly at spatial scales
accounting for the heterogeneity of individual identity, business
governance and policymaking across nations, and international exchanges.
This limits our ability to understand feedbacks, identify intervention
points, develop quantitative models and inform strategies to minimise
the risk of societal collapse occurring in the future.88 Given the
insights from this review, we refine the aim of this chapter as follows.
Firstly, the empirical evidence base should specifically address
contemporary society. Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at a scale
and granularity that addresses the heterogenous characteristics of
nations and international interactions. The refined aim of this chapter
is thus to identify an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structure
the evidence base with a CLD defined at global scale and national
granularity. 3. Methodology A two-stage framework, consisting of five
steps, was developed to achieve the aim of this chapter. For each step,
below, we first introduce it generically and then describe its
application to our specific analysis of the ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway. 3.1. Stage 1:
Establishing an empirical evidence base of societal collapse in
contemporary society Step I deploys societal collapse proxies via a key
word search to identify "evidence points", which in this instance may be
considered data points, in the form of publications that empirically
examine the causal pathway of interest in contemporary society. The
determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these societal collapse proxies
to establish the new empirical evidence base in lieu of historical
societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary society. The ﻿
population loss set are straightforward to isolate, consistent to
measure across nations and describe tangible consequences. The
institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the societal
collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality (i.e.
starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality and
emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports. The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the
search is contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately
3,000 publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main
body as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of
the following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly. This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base
consisting of 41 evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4. Step
II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical evidence
base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final CLD (f-CLD)
in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base across the
system. In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread
as this provides information on data that may be useful for future
studies. Four methodological categories were identified in the new
empirical evidence base. Each evidence point was classified into one of
these categories and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative ﻿
complex systems model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative
dataset --- blue; collection / analysis of qualitative interview /
survey data --- green; quantitative data-led case study / scenario ---
yellow. The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is
shown in Fig. 4. 3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop
diagram from the empirical evidence base Step III involves creating an
individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence point to clearly structure the
complex causal relationships examined. These i-CLDs provide the building
blocks from which to construct the f-CLD in Step IV. [\[FIGURE 3
REMOVED\]]{.underline} The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The
corresponding evidence point was examined in its entirety to identify
and record key information in the form of variables (nodes), links
(arrowed lines) and relationship notation (positive or negative). Key
information derived from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main
analysis, of the evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according
to the typology classification established in Step II. Any relationships
hypothesised but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey.
Key information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review,
of the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of
the i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process
was repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set
of i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base. All 41
i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity. The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect
is related to component (variables and links) definition, necessary to
maximise clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained
in the evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs
becoming dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their ﻿ utility. The
other aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the
f-CLD conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows. The \~950 variables
from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank worksheet for the
f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering approach was used to
reconcile these variables into like groups. For each group, an
overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD variables in the group
were virtually deposited into a matrix for that major node. For example,
drought, sea level rise and crop disease were some of the i-CLD
variables clustered into an environmental risk factors f-CLD major node
matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level of aggregation
representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled down any global
or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national or local
aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household food imports
was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled up to
national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD. The \~1150 links from the
set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed lines between the major
nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required interpretation of implied
causality in the i-CLD relationships in order to route them across the
major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an i-CLD showed a direct
link from international food price to conflict variables, this was
routed using arrowed lines from international food price to national
food price to food ﻿ accessibility to food insecurity and finally to
conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there was a discrepancy
between relationship descriptions, the relationship with the most
supporting i-CLDs was adopted. The interim f-CLD produced at the end of
each standardisation iteration was examined to determine whether the
major node definition could be refined to maximise clarity. For example,
in one iteration water and land were defined as separate major nodes,
but examination determined that each had the same arrowed lines to other
major nodes; therefore, another iteration was undertaken with water and
land now clustered under a single natural resources major node in order
to minimise redundant arrowed lines. This process was iterated several
times until an f-CLD had been constructed at an appropriate level of
detail for this study. Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in
Section 290 was cross- referenced, but not included as evidence points,
to ensure comprehensive coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD. The
standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.). Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD
using a weighted (line thickness) typology (colour-coded) approach. This
visually documents the spread of the evidence base across the system
described by the f-CLD. The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as
follows. Each variable (node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its
corresponding major node(s) in the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of
the i-CLD was assigned to a corresponding route along the arrowed lines
in the f-CLD. Each time an arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link
assigned to it, an incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in
the corresponding typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to
the f-CLD arrowed line. This process was repeated for each of the 41
i-CLDs until all had been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process
for each of the 41 i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information
(D.). The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5. 4. Results and Discussion The new empirical evidence base and
novel-format CLD of ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society resulting from the application of our
original methodology (Section 3) are discussed in turn below. 4.1.
Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society The new empirical evidence base
(Section 3, Step I), along with its colour-coded typology (Section 3,
Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It consists of 41 evidence points, of
which 9 examine the natural mortality (i.e. starvation, with respect to
food insecurity), 20 the conflict mortality and 12 the emigration
societal collapse proxy, alongside other human and natural world system
factors. We discuss three key aspects of the evidence base, namely
temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven method distribution, and
advantages of each data-driven methods, below. The temporal scale and
granularity of study varies across the evidence base; however, our
methodology limited the possible scale of study to the period from 1990
to present, representative of contemporary society. Within this period,
approximately half of the evidence points cover a scale of less than one
decade and the other half a scale of greater than one decade.
Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses at yearly
granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity greater
than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at monthly
granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies across
the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD. The distribution
of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is notably
different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for natural
mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey data. This
is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human survival is
well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food and mortality
data sets would not yield significantly new insights into thresholds
whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an individual's
circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence points for
conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of existing datasets.
This likely reflects the interest in rigorously curated conflict
datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and peace fields.
Evidence points for emigration mostly use collection/analysis of
interview/survey data, likely because this provides nuanced insight into
an individual's decision to migrate. It may also be due to data
availability and quality challenges that limit quantitative statistical
analyses, which are being addressed by groups such as the International
Organization for Migration's Global Migration Data Analysis Centre.93
Amongst these data challenges, it is important to recognise the issue of
reconciling different types of voluntary and forced migration with
causal drivers, given the complex social, economic and political factors
at play; this challenge similarly applies to the other societal collapse
proxies but is particularly noted in the migration studies. We observe
from these studies that a food insecurity threshold for natural
mortality is well established but thresholds for conflict mortality and
emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal drivers within
datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these determinants
remains a "grand challenge".94 [\[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\]]{.underline} Each
data-driven method offers different advantages. The ﻿ complex ﻿ systems
models each describe "chunks" of the system at different scale and
granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are ﻿ calibrated
to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key
relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively
examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables within the system, which can be used as a
mathematical basis for extending ﻿ modelling capabilities. The
collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into
qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that
quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case
study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert
interpretation to better understand global trends and ﻿ forecasts. These
latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of ﻿
modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their
application in decision- making processes. Collectively, these different
data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of
relationships in the system of interest. 4.2. Causal loop diagram of the
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary
society at global scale and national granularity The main result of this
chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3, Step V), presented in Fig.
5. It structures the relationships between ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse as described in our new empirical
evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in Section 4.1). We
discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights related to the
spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative ﻿ complex system depicted,
and quantitative ﻿ complex system ﻿ modelling, below, alongside
consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of CLDs. Our
CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our
empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively,
to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the
empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables.
Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused
with respect to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of
gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that the link between
food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence
points using statistical analyses (blue), whereas the links between food
insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality,
have been investigated mostly by evidence points using
interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may be useful to
investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter
using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered
by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1. It is
important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density for
important links or even be missing important variables and/or links,
either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word
search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For
example, our study focused on the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical
evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway, whereas
the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between
fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence.
Similarly, our use of the ﻿ population loss set of societal collapse
proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict
mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown set are
not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to
maximise the ﻿ rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the
spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of
exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD
presented here. Further, we can see that while empirical studies have
linked ﻿ climate change via food insecurity to our societal collapse
proxies of natural mortality, conflict mortality and emigration, we
found no empirical studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of
societal collapse. This was expected given the motivation of this study
(Section 1) and is due to the fact that there are no contemporary events
of societal collapse, under the same definition as those in the
historical studies pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these
links to be empirically studied.95 Having considered the spread of
empirical evidence, we now consider the ﻿ complex system documented. A
key benefit of CLDs is that they simply present a myriad of information
in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs enable comprehension of the
structure and behaviour of ﻿ complex systems, including feedbacks,
intervention points and far- reaching interdependencies.96 Our CLD
visually depicts a system of 39 variables, 105 links and 32,000 feedback
loops,97 integrating information from different fields including climate
science, ﻿ food security, conflict, migration and health research.
Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how ﻿ population
growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic
factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive ﻿
climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive ﻿ climate change via
consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly
(e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/ output
(e.g. processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g.
extreme weather events) of ﻿ climate change may cause losses of food
production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via
agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for
irrigation). A country's food availability is influenced by domestic
food production and international food trade. Food ﻿ accessibility is
influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of
food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international
food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food
subsidies). Food utilisation is influenced by ﻿ infrastructure/services
(e.g. ﻿ education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural
traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of
food availability, food ﻿ accessibility and food utilisation. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation),
conflict and migration, contributing to ﻿ population loss, as well as
economic shocks and socio- political instability, contributing to
institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse. [Beyond]{.underline} a given country suffering [increased
natural mortality]{.underline}, [famines]{.underline} (i.e. [food
insecurity]{.underline}) [can place pressure on international
humanitarian efforts]{.underline} ([i.e. **institutional** risk
factors]{.underline}). [Conflict may occur domestically or
**internationally**]{.underline} [and can **feedback**]{.underline} [to
**exacerbate**]{.underline} [food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential
[mass emigration can increase **pressure** on food
availability]{.underline}, [natural resources and ﻿
infrastructure/services in the destination nation]{.underline}, which
can lead to socio- cultural tensions (i.e. institutional risk factors)
that fuel conflict. [[Food insecurity]{.mark} can]{.underline} also
**[directly]{.underline}** [[contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark}
institutional risk factors such as [social unrest, political instability
and economic inequality]{.underline}, [which increase the risk of
[societal collapse due to **institutional

internationally**]{.underline}. [While already fragile ﻿ states are
**expected**]{.underline} [to be hit the worst
**directly**]{.underline}, these [insights reveal the **indirect**
ramifications of ﻿ climate change on our **globalised
society**]{.underline},98 [with **serious consequences**]{.underline}
[for **humanity's "existential security".**]{.underline}99 [While some
of these relationships may appear **obvious**]{.underline}, it is the
act of [**bringing** this information]{.underline}, [which may otherwise
be **siloed**]{.underline} and thus preventing consideration of the full
story, **[together]{.underline}** [in one place]{.underline} that [is of
value]{.underline}.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to provide readers
with the opportunity to explore the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, consider worst-case scenarios that we
want to avoid, develop transformative narratives of "where we want to
go" and think about interventions that may help us attain this desired
future.101 It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as
their information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on
information portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our
interpretation of that information. As such, there exist challenges and
limitations.102 For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships
in different contexts and locations, because they can only depict a
single scale and granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality
between variables in a CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both
directions rather than one. CLDs can often become either too complicated
or too simplified, which undermines their usefulness. In considering
each of these issues, our original methodology attempted to maximise the
﻿rigour and transparency of our study by first documenting the
information in each evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently
applying, and recording, the iterative process of reconciling the
variables and links from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the
selected global scale and national granularity. In doing so, we sought
to enable the reader to be aware of the nuances of the different scales
and granularity of information underpinning our CLD, as well as our
process of carefully reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39
variables and 1150 links to 105 links to maximise the information
conveyed while balancing readability. It is also important to note that,
due to their qualitative and static ﻿ nature, CLDs do not enable us to
comprehend the dynamics of the system, including nonlinear and emergent
behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative results and time delays.103
Complex systems models, although with their own challenges and
limitations,104 provide the opportunity to quantitatively analyse the
dynamics of a system and gain insights into the potentially far-reaching
impacts of our decisions.105 However, ﻿ complex ﻿ systems models that
explicitly examine societal collapse in contemporary society are
underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics model106 --- an evidence
point in this study (refer to Supplementary Information D).107 --- is
the eminent model of relevance, with only a limited number of studies
building on it. World3 examines the potential for
"overshoot-and-collapse" given ﻿ population and industrial growth within
the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system, implicitly
accounting for ﻿ climate change and explicitly accounting for food
availability. The information contained in our CLD and empirical
evidence base may be useful in identifying and informing opportunities
to improve these existing ﻿ complex systems ﻿ modelling capabilities for ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For
example, our CLD highlights important factors at global scale and
national granularity that World3 does not incorporate because it is
defined at global scale and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish
heterogenous characteristics of nations, such as distribution of ﻿
population or geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does
not account for international interactions, such as food trade, conflict
and migration. Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by
natural mortality (defined by food availability, age and pollution) and
does not include the other two ﻿ population loss secondary determinants,
as noted in the previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown
secondary determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide
useful direction to datasets, it is important to note that
quantitatively defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as
discussed in Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing ﻿ complex
﻿systems models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with
national identity, business governance and policy-making are
concentrated at national level, and international interactions underpin
the functioning of contemporary society it could be valuable to model
societal collapse risk profiles of different nations to inform the
prioritisation and development of intervention strategies. [\[FIGURE 5
REMOVED\]]{.underline} 5. Conclusions and Future Work This chapter
identified an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structured
the evidence base using a novel-format CLD defined at global scale and
national granularity. Two types of future work could extend from the
results of this chapter. Identification of gaps in the spread of
evidence across the CLD may guide future data-driven efforts to examine
these causal relationships and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence
base may be used to develop quantitative ﻿ modelling capabilities,
particularly by transforming the structure of World3 to account for
heterogenous national characteristics and international interactions.
Three types of future work could extend from the methodology and
literature synthesis. The causal pathway examined in this chapter could
be further detailed by re-applying the methodology using the
institutional breakdown set of societal collapse proxies instead of the ﻿
population loss set. The methodology, using either set of societal
collapse proxies, could be applied to detail other causal pathways
between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. The methodology,
excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could be applied to
document the information in the historical studies identified in the
literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be applied to
construct CLDs at different scales and granularities. It is hoped that
this chapter has contributed to developing our understanding of the
causal pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses an ﻿ existential risk
to humanity and facilitates opportunities for future work. [\[REFERENCES
OMITTED\] \[CHAPTER 14 BEGINS\]]{.underline} Highlights: • In this short
chapter the authors draw on several research strands and papers within
CSER to offer a theoretical reflection on how to think about
catastrophic climate change and what Existential Risk Studies can learn
from climate change research. • [This is **intended to build** on the
**previous chapter**]{.underline}, [in which Catherine
Richards]{.underline}, Richard Lupton, and Julian Allwood [provide an
empirical assessment of one **highly concerning**]{.underline} [risk
cascade]{.underline} involving climate change and highlight its
potential contribution to global catastrophic and existential risk. •
Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and has
deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster risk
management, environmental studies, and food security. • Drawing on these
studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to frame research
questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic climate change
to be neglected by climate and existential risk researchers alike, and
how to incorporate assessments of response risk and co-benefits into
thinking about catastrophic climate change. This short chapter brings
together a number of important ideas and draws readers attention to
other extant bodies of literature. The relative value of ﻿ co-benefits
approaches is discussed in other chapters in this volume, including
Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of ﻿ response risks are further
discussed in Chapter 2. 1. [Asking the **Wrong Questions** for the
**Right Reasons** **Within**]{.underline} [Existential Risk Studies it
is common to hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "is ﻿ climate
change an ﻿ existential risk?"]{.underline}, and [many]{.underline} who
ask this question [answer **negatively**]{.underline},
[arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿ climate change is not an
important topic of research **within the field**]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered affirmatively or
not,]{.underline} [this question is **misguided**]{.underline}. There
are three reasons for thinking this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes
little sense on a **probabilistic** level]{.underline}; whether
something will be [a threat to]{.underline} our [collective existence is
not]{.underline} a [**binary** matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of
likelihood]{.underline}. However, **[many researchers]{.underline}**
[within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly**]{.underline} [conflict ﻿
existential risk with **events**]{.underline} [that could be existential
﻿catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate]{.mark}
change is not a **single uniform process**]{.underline} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [it is a set of **diffuse
impacts**]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating]{.mark} different **[risk ﻿
cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Richards et al. show, [it
[will]{.mark} inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a **host** of [other
threats]{.mark} (not only ﻿ **food security** and **societal
collapse**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [volcanic eruptions or]{.underline}
the [emergence of **zoonotic pathogens**),]{.underline}1 and [these can
**interact**]{.underline} with one another [to [create
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or
**"[global]{.mark} systems [death spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2
Finally, "﻿ existential risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for
the question to ever be answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential
risk that have received the greatest public attention thus far, such as
Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not in terms of an impact on humanity at any point
in time but rather in terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3
either referring to the author(s) particular vision of a high-tech
intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

The **[Gaza]{.underline}** war and the regional conflicts it has
unleashed are **[revealing]{.underline}** that, [no matter how much
p]{.underline}olitical, [**financial**, and **military** capital
[Washington]{.mark} invests, it [can **no longer force**]{.mark} the
policy [**outcomes**]{.mark} it wants]{.underline}---if it ever could.
At every turn, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
**[enabled]{.mark}**]{.underline} the Israeli invasion and decimation of
Gaza, even as the Biden administration has touted its hopes for peace.
It is [[a **losing strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The world knows that
the United States could force an end to the Israeli campaign and has
chosen not to, and [Washington's]{.underline} international
[**[rep]{.mark}utation** [is]{.mark} near [an **all-time
low**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A growing portion of the American electorate
appears to be turning against Biden, at least in part [because of the
**hypocritical** U.S. policy]{.underline} on Palestine. America's [role
in]{.underline} the [[war has]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[been]{.mark} **politically** [costly]{.mark}.]{.underline} By the
**[[amoral]{.underline}]{.mark}** measure of military victory,
Washington has also been **[[ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
combined might of the United States and Israel has not been enough to
achieve Israel's stated goals, including the release of hostages and
dismantling of Hamas. And American firepower has failed to deter Houthi
attacks on Red Sea shipping. The United States has a way out of this
mess, but it must act quickly: [Washington needs]{.underline} to develop
a recalibrated foreign policy tailored to America's [more **limited
power**]{.underline}, and to a more competitive, less easily regimented
global environment. While the government and American policy elites
might not be ready to hear this message, sooner or later they will have
to reckon with reality. In the meantime, progressives must begin
developing a U.S. foreign policy that promotes American values while
being more attuned to Washington's attenuated influence. [An
**Inevitable Transition** Washington's [**inability** to drive
events]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle East [or achieve policy goals,
and its **shrinking** global **standing**]{.underline}, are symptomatic
of a long-term trend. American hegemony, while not fully expired, is in
retreat. The United States must contend with an increasingly dynamic
global balance of power[. In the emerging world order[, it is **no
longer possible** for **one**]{.mark}]{.underline} or a few dominant
**[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [[to **impose** their will]{.mark}
on]{.underline} smaller **[countries]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} on
the swelling array of [**hybrid** and **nonstate actors**]{.underline}
that populate modern-day wars. Many so-called [middle
powers]{.underline} choose to [balance]{.underline} multiple,
overlapping [alliances]{.underline} over preferential relationships with
Washington. As the international order is transformed, the United States
looks increasingly like just one player, albeit a significantly powerful
one, among many. This moment of transition contains elements of both
risk and reward for the United States. On the one hand, America is
well-placed to be a leader in the new international order. It is still
the most powerful country with the most alliances, the most attractive
economy, a huge military footprint, and a dominant platform in world
culture. Washington needs to develop a recalibrated foreign policy
tailored to America's more limited power. But Washington will only be a
beneficiary of the new order if it is willing to change the way it
approaches its foreign policy. And right now, the rules-based order
Washington claims to represent and the United States' already damaged
moral authority---an important pillar of its international
influence---both look increasingly tenuous. In a previous commentary,
"Time to Discard the Bad Policy That Enabled the Gaza War," we drew on
conversations with dozens of policy experts and officials to map the
roots of American policy misalignment in the Middle East. We argued
that, before October 7, the United States had bought into the idea that
the Middle East could be stabilized by a mixture of realpolitik,
economic self-interest, authoritarianism, and managing rather than
resolving wars, including the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. We argued
that [[the American **approach** has]{.mark} proven
**counterproductive**, increasing **challenges**]{.underline} to U.S.
interests and [international **standing**, and [lead]{.mark}ing
[to]{.mark} an unending cycle of **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that spread human misery [while **deepening**]{.underline} the Middle
East's [strategic **malaise**.]{.underline} Until now, [Washington has
refused to acknowledge its shrinking **hegemony**. It has tried to stay
the course]{.underline}, and [ended up]{.underline} in an even weaker
position: [**[multiple wars]{.underline}**,]{.mark} severely eroded
moral authority, [and increasing **[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Here, we argue that the United States can negotiate these changes and
still maximize its global influence, but only if it changes its approach
to foreign policy. Mismatched Ambitions and Influence Simply put, [a
**realignment**]{.underline} of the international order [is
**underway**]{.underline}, and American foreign policy is not keeping
up. At least since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, American foreign policy
has been [out of sync with U.S. capabilities]{.underline}: Even when its
power was undisputed, the United States was unable to act as the world's
policeman, but nevertheless sought to assert itself as the indispensable
global power. [A series of [**events**, bad **policies**, and
**setbacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the 2003
invasion---**[[painful]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only [[for
America's]{.mark} self-[image]{.mark}]{.underline} but for many
communities destabilized or destroyed in the shockwaves---have been
insufficient to force a correction. Now, [a more **multipolar** order is
**emerging**]{.underline}, one in which the United States is likely to
remain a preeminent player, perhaps the single most influential state.
But Washington will no longer be able to determine outcomes or assume
that its economic and political heft insulate it from paying major costs
for its missteps. U.S. government officials and many in the policy elite
acknowledge that the world is changing. But they are not quite ready to
contemplate, at least in public, an American strategy that accepts a
more modest understanding of U.S. influence; or that accepts that
Washington will have to triage its priorities on the global stage.
President Trump's "America First" and President Biden's "foreign policy
for the middle class" had one thing in common: neither acknowledged that
U.S. power is in relative decline. Despite many differences, both
doctrines began with a false belief that Washington could sustain
international dominance at minimal cost and risk. Like pre-October 7
Middle East policy, these ambitious proposals to reconfigure U.S.
foreign policy all too often disintegrate on contact with the real
world. Sooner or later, one U.S. administration or another will have to
confront reality: [there is **no**]{.underline} magic [**formula** that
will allow]{.underline} [**the** U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to maintain its current level of **global power**
and **influence**]{.underline}, prioritize its national interests and
domestic politics, [and continue to project]{.underline} moral
[authority without incurring huge]{.underline}, politically unpalatable
[costs]{.underline}. At least since the invasion of Iraq, U.S. foreign
policy has been out of sync with its capabilities. The good news is that
the United States can maintain its position of global leadership. Less
welcome news is that this will mean a painful rethink of America's place
in the world and a different sort of leadership than the kind the United
States displayed during the Cold War and the decades after it. Instead,
it must act more like France and Germany do in the EU, or American
automakers eventually did in response to globalization: leading as the
first among equals in a competitive marketplace, and recognizing the
outer limits of its influence and power. Crucially, the United States
must understand the American value-add relative to other countries, by
genuinely prioritizing issues like multilateralism and human rights that
are core to its identity, and which its competitors disregard. If it can
strike the right balance, the United States can accomplish important
good for the world while pursuing its own interests and acknowledging
the interests and priorities of other countries. The Middle East would
be a good place to pilot this new foreign policy---not only because the
current violence and crisis demand better policies, but also because it
is in the Middle East that U.S. aspirations are most strikingly
misaligned with actual American power. A New Approach A new American
approach would prioritize global cooperation to meet the sweeping
structural challenges of our age. In bilateral relations with other
states, the United States ought to recenter values. To execute this new
approach, the U.S. government would have to set realistic expectations
about what American power can achieve in regions like the Middle East.
Neither the United States nor Israel, for example, can dismantle
Hamas---especially not with the current war in Gaza. The brutal military
campaign has become an exercise in radicalizing the Palestinian
population against Israel and the United States, and is driving the
Middle East into region-wide conflict. What is within American power is
putting a stop to the Gaza war---not just pausing the fighting---and
pursuing a political settlement to the Israeli--Palestinian conflict,
based on international law (including the 1967 borders), that reduces
the chance of mass violence by any party. These actions would
significantly improve regional security, and American standing in the
Middle East and the world, while taking away a significant pillar of
anti-American groups' platforms. The genuine pursuit of peace would also
be politically and financially costly, and take years across multiple
U.S. administrations. The United States needs to acknowledge that it
cannot achieve its goals alone, and must seek to share the
burden---including with key international competitors. America needs to
reframe Middle Eastern conflict and instability as a global systemic
issue on a par with COVID-19 or climate change, and seek a genuinely
multilateral response that includes rival superpowers, including, for
example, China. For years, China has been a free-rider on American
security guarantees in the Middle East while lambasting Washington for
its regional policies, including on Israel--Palestine, propping up
Iran's economy, and seeking improved relations with American allies and
partners. Beijing clearly has a vested interest in the stability of a
region that is essential to its energy supply and the global trade
routes that underpin its export-led economy, and has dipped its toes
into mediation in the region. The United States should push for more‚ by
publicly calling on the four other permanent members of the UN Security
Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom) to join Washington
in supporting an Israeli--Palestinian peace process that includes a
prominent role for regional mediation, and a Middle Eastern security
framework that they jointly guarantee, with the United States and China
taking the lead. Actively encouraging autocratic competitor states to
become more involved in the region might appear to be counter to U.S.
interests and values. But a multilateral diplomatic effort on
Israel--Palestine, and the development of a regional security
architecture guaranteed by the Security Council that prioritizes
conflict resolution and regional detente, would free the United States
to stand up for its core values in ways that it struggles to achieve
when it acts alone. The United States is often hesitant to push its
regional allies to comply with international humanitarian or human
rights law, because it fears it will lose influence over their behavior,
or that they might realign toward competitors like China. The Biden
administration hoped its post-October 7 bear hug of Israel would provide
it with influence over the military campaign in Gaza. But it hasn't
worked at all---Israel's assault has been merciless, and it is now
bearing down on Rafah, the last refuge of more than 1.5 million
Palestinians. Meanwhile, keeping China completely out of the region is a
lost cause: many regional players, including Israel and U.S. partners
like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are already seeking
improved relations with China, and will continue to do so in future.
Washington could secure its core strategic interests---trade and
energy---with the other elements of this policy shift in place: A peace
process would be underway in the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. The new
security architecture would improve regional stability and, crucially,
catalyze conflict resolution rather than merely managing conflict.
Regional conflict between global superpowers would be somewhat
mitigated. Washington could then condition military and other forms of
support to its regional allies and partners (for example, Egypt, Israel,
and Saudi Arabia) on improved human rights and rule of law. In doing so,
it would also call the bluff of partners who have tacitly threatened to
defect to the Chinese or Russian camp, but know that neither Beijing nor
Moscow is willing or able to provide the kind of security guarantees the
U.S currently does. No More Hegemony on the Cheap A dose of realism
would be required to successfully push for multilateral peace-brokering
and stability initiatives while pursuing a values-based bilateral
foreign policy. These policies would by no means achieve perfect
outcomes, and would require the United States to accept some big
up-front costs, including increased regional influence for its rivals
and turbulent relations with long-standing partners. Yet failure to
correct the course would have much worse consequences. [[If Washington
continues]{.mark} on its **current path**]{.underline} in the Middle
East, [[it will remain on the **hook** for]{.mark} **regional
[security]{.mark}** as its influence fades]{.underline} and China and
Russia continue to exploit conflicts to their own benefit. The reality
is that [[if]{.mark} American **[leaders]{.mark}** continue to
**[pursue]{.mark}** a policy of **[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} on
the cheap, while shunning other powers' help on major structural issues,
the American competitive advantage in world affairs will continue to
shrink. [[Washington will be **viewed** as]{.mark} just another
**[self-interested]{.mark} power**]{.underline} among many, one
struggling to maintain alliances with states whose values do not align
with its own, yet unable to make some of the transactional
accommodations that nondemocratic competitors have no problem making.
The American government and policy elite might not yet be ready to
openly espouse a strategy that accepts the limits to U.S. influence and
opens doors to competitors. But the realignment of relative world power
is already underway, and in practice [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has two
obvious choices. It [[can]{.mark} **double down**]{.underline} on the
status quo, and continue [**pretending** it is still the]{.underline}
world's sole **[superpower]{.underline}** while paying lip service to
values that it fails to back with meaningful policies---thus
**[[forfeit]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** still [more [**influence**.
Or]{.mark} it can **[embrace]{.mark} change**]{.underline}, steer [into
[the]{.mark} multipolar **[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and seek
[[to lead]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in partnership with
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} strong [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark},
and as a force for good in the world. Political constraints make it
easier to stay on the current, flawed path, at least in the short term.
But the best choice is clear: [a more **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
international **[[role]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the United States
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[be]{.mark} the
braver]{.underline} and **[[more effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Containment [trades off]{.underline} with domestic investments, which makes collapse inevitable

**Shifrinson 21**, Assistant Professor of International Relations at
Boston University. (Joshua R. Itzkowitz, Winter 2021, "Neo-Primacy and
the Pitfalls of US Strategy toward China", *The Washington Quarterly*,
43:4, 90-91)

The US Faces Domestic Constraints Third, [neo-primacy is of
**questionable domestic sustainability**]{.underline}---indeed, [it has
the potential to **undermine** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} [own strength]{.underline}.
Independent of competition with China, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates likely [**[needs]{.mark} substantial
[investments]{.mark}** [in **healthcare**, **education**, and
**infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline} (among others) over the coming
decades. Although some of these could be funded as part of a
neo-primacist competition with China, [other social
programs]{.underline} ([e.g., Social Security and public
pensions]{.underline}) [are likely to require additional funding,
particularly as US demographics change]{.underline}.59 [This situation
is further exacerbated as bills come due for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} **[prior spending]{.underline}**; as
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported [even
**before**]{.underline} the **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic
[**reduced revenue** and **increased borrowing**]{.underline}, [by
2028]{.underline} "[[the]{.mark} \[Federal\] [government will spend
**more on**]{.mark} **net [interest]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} it will
spend on either **[defense]{.mark}** or **nondefense discretionary
outlays**]{.underline}." 60 Of course, the United States can service its
financial obligations by raising taxes, accepting additional debt, or
both.61 Unless the US economy grows faster than US obligations, however,
the United States will face a difficult choice in the years ahead. On
the one hand, policymakers can constrain the funding available for
foreign activities in order to devote the marginal resource to domestic
needs. In this situation, [neo-[primacy could prove **unsustainable**,
as the **resources** ]{.mark}**needed** to compete with China for
international dominance at a time of declining US relative power [prove
lacking]{.mark} due to **internal demands**]{.underline}. [The United
States would then risk taking on foreign obligations and exacerbating
tensions with China without the wherewithal to service these
missions.]{.underline} On the other hand, [policymakers might opt to
**suppress domestic consumption** to fund the contest with
China]{.underline}. Here, however, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[could]{.mark} end up **[harm]{.mark}ing
[its]{.mark} long-term [competitiveness]{.mark}** [by
**foregoing**]{.mark} the sort of socio-economic [spending that would
ensure]{.mark} US **[economic and military
dynamism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In effect, [current [military
consumption]{.mark} would **[crowd out]{.mark} future [domestic
investment]{.mark}**. Neo-[primacy]{.mark} then [risks]{.mark} being
left unworkable by [**dragging down** the]{.mark} **underlying
[foundations of]{.mark} US [strength]{.mark}** over time.]{.underline}
To be sure, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[' ability to
borrow at favorable rates while attracting foreign investment can
moderate the intensity with which these guns-versus-butter choices have
to be made. Still, they **do not eliminate the problem**]{.underline}.
[All spending choices entail **opportunity costs**, and there are
grounds to believe neo-primacy's costs leave the approach
**unworkable**.]{.underline}

Crisis Facilitates Change The case studies show that [[**crisis** is
a]{.mark} great **[driver]{.mark} and facilitator** [of
**change**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that foreign policy
[[leaders]{.mark} should]{.underline} have an idea of how they might
[use a **crisis** to **open** or foreclose **opportunities** to
[shift]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The case of 9/11 makes
the importance of crises unmistakably clear, but international crises
spurred change in the NSC-68 and Vietnam War cases as well. There is
truth in the adage "Never let a good crisis go to waste." [Crises
[generate]{.mark} **policy [plasticity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, opening
the door to strategic change. [[Absent]{.mark} a
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, a president seeking [[significant
**changes** in **fo**]{.mark}reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [faces a much
**harder task**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider [the impact
of]{.underline} the outbreak of [[the **Korean War**]{.mark} on U.S.
Cold War strategy]{.underline}. The hawkish global approach that Nitze
developed in NSC-68 initially faced opposition inside and outside the
government. The plan was basically shelved in the spring of 1950, and it
gained new life only when the Korean War erupted in June. North Korea's
invasion of South Korea seemed to support NSC-68's central claim that
the United States could not afford to focus solely on competition with
the Soviet Union in Europe. The outbreak of [the war]{.underline} also
[created a sense of urgency]{.underline} that NSC-68's advocates used to
turn their strategy into a reality. [As a **result**, the **U**nited
**S**tates adopted a more **geographically expansive** and
**military-centered conception** of how to wage the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. [The **9/11 attacks** provide an even more clear-cut
case]{.underline} of how a foreign policy crisis fosters major change.
The terrorist attacks created so strong a national desire to punish
al-Qaeda and to prevent another assault on American soil as to give the
Bush administration as close to a free hand in foreign policy as any
presidency since the Second World War. [The White House **used** the
crisis]{.underline} not just to put a higher priority on
counterterrorism but also [to **increase** defense **spending** and
**implement** a **neoconservative** grand **strategy**]{.underline}
aimed at building democracy in the Middle East through military force.
Conversely, [[Carter's]{.mark} **failed [attempt]{.mark}** [to
**withdraw**]{.mark} U.S. forces from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[illustrates]{.mark} the [**difficulty**]{.mark} of achieving
significant **change without a crisis**]{.underline} to motivate and
galvanize support for it. Carter came into office on the heels of
economic and foreign policy crises: the 1973 inflation spike and the
Vietnam War. The latter was one reason he wanted to reduce the U.S.
military posture in Asia by withdrawing forces from South Korea. By the
time he took office, however, these problems had lost intensity.
[**[Support]{.mark}** for **withdrawal** from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[**dissipated**]{.mark} over time]{.underline}, and Carter was
eventually forced to shelve the idea. Crisis is not always necessary for
major change. The Biden administration withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021
in the absence of a foreign policy crisis. It decided to withdraw U.S.
forces in the first year of the administration, during a honeymoon
period when the president still enjoyed strong support from his own
party and control of Congress. The policy had also been pursued by
Trump, making it more difficult for Republicans in Congress to criticize
the withdrawal harshly. By 2021, moreover, evidence that the United
States was not achieving its stated objectives in Afghanistan had piled
up over the years, weakening resistance to change and making withdrawal
popular among a large majority of the American public. Why do
**[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** facilitate change? One reason is that
they tend to [[**generate**]{.mark} an **emotional [impetus]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}for action]{.underline}[, [making
**people**]{.underline}]{.mark} [more likely to [**rethink**]{.mark}
their **fundamental [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and goals. In a
time of crisis, [[the public]{.mark}, Congress, [and]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark} bureaucracy [yearn for]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pressure for action is not always a good
thing, because sometimes the best policy is to avoid taking action in
the first place---in other words, to do nothing---but if the White House
is aiming for a major change, [a crisis [generates]{.mark} a
**[permissive atmosphere]{.mark}** for change to **gain
traction**]{.underline}. **[Crises]{.underline}** can also
[**[overwhelm]{.mark} existing [beliefs]{.mark}** []{.mark}with
disconfirming **info**rmation]{.underline}. In normal times, people tend
to interpret facts according to existing mental frameworks rather than
to revise the frameworks themselves. But [a crisis can cause people to
**rethink assumptions** if an existing framework has proven to be
inadequate for understanding the world]{.underline} and generated
harmful consequences.^1^ In addition, [crises [generate]{.mark} a
**sense of [urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [which can
generate]{.underline} the **[momentum]{.underline}** needed [[to
overcome inertia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts on change in businesses,
for example, have pointed out that a sense of urgency can be essential
to large-scale change because it helps generate collective action.^2^

[Nearly immune]{.underline}, however, [is not **immune**]{.underline}.

[of]{.mark} contradictory [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
Psychologists who have studied evolution in beliefs report that despite
occasional epiphanies that instantly change minds, like that of Saul on
the road to Damascus, generally speaking the process is very gradual,
and sometimes imperceptible.53 Individuals often recognize that a change
in their beliefs has occurred after the fact, and they resist admitting
that their minds are evolving while the process is under way. [There are
examples of **[gradual]{.mark}**,]{.underline} even generational
[[evolution of beliefs]{.mark} that can give hope to those seeking to
**expunge fear** and **indispensability** from U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} "**[[Social Darwinism]{.underline}]{.mark}**," for
instance, **[poisoned]{.underline}** [international politics for
**decades**]{.underline}. The belief that humanity was split into a
number of distinct "races" in a perpetual existential struggle where
only the fittest survive shaped the worldview of generations of
leaders.54 Social Darwinism helped justify any number of pathological
policies, from imperialism to the Holocaust, **[but]{.underline}** over
time, [it **[collapsed]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} the weight
of]{.underline} rational **[[counterargument]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence]{.underline}**. The identification of DNA
and the understanding of the genome allowed science to put social
Darwinism and its cousins, eugenics and phrenology, to rest once and for
all.55 Previously, [internalized beliefs]{.underline} about the
inevitability of competition between races [were]{.underline} slowly
[changed by]{.underline} the onslaught of **[evidence]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}**, and the understanding that
differences among peoples were cultural rather than genetic. The edifice
did not collapse all at once or with equal speed everywhere, but over
time arguments based on the foundation of social Darwinism stopped
winning popular debates on that "battlefield of beliefs," and foreign
policy behavior changed. Precedent, then, exists for evolution in
fundamental beliefs, enough for one to hope that a similar process could
eventually change popular perceptions toward modern, counterproductive
irrationalities. Precedent does not supply the only encouragement.
[Changing the dominant [U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} belief system is
perhaps **[not as daunting]{.mark} a challenge** as it may at first
seem]{.underline}, for a number of reasons. **[First]{.underline}**, as
already discussed, [[only]{.mark} a **[small number]{.mark} of
opinions** would [have to be altered to have]{.mark} a **[significant
effect]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As nice as it is to imagine that the
United States runs a democratic foreign policy, in reality not all
opinions are equally important. Altering the beliefs of the masses may
be quite difficult, but it is those of the elite that are decisive in
foreign policy; [affecting elites, if only because they are fewer in
number, might not prove to be an **insurmountable task**]{.underline}.
As influential as NSC 68 was, for instance, it was an internal document
read only by senior government officials, and it remained classified
until 1975. The various incarnations of the Committee on Present Danger
concentrated their efforts solely on the upper echelons of the foreign
policy community, and they were quite successful in affecting foreign
policy debate and practice. [Success in minimizing pathological foreign
policy behavior can occur **long before majorities** alter their
beliefs. **Second**]{.underline}, there is reason to believe that
[[foreign policy beliefs]{.mark} are **[not as entrenched as]{.mark}
some [others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many modern American
[politicians]{.mark}]{.underline} --- to say nothing of the people they
lead --- [[know **very little**]{.mark} about foreign
policy]{.underline}. The U.S. Congress is a wasteland of parochialism,
where members can even be punished for appearing to know too much about
the rest of the world.56 Those at the top of the executive branch have
been little better. The past three U.S. presidents had no background in
foreign affairs before coming into office. Bill Clinton even managed to
turn his opponent's foreign policy expertise into a liability in 1992,
claiming that it demonstrated that the elder Bush did not pay adequate
attention to domestic concerns. Eight years later, voters were unfazed
about George W. Bush's disinterest in the outside world, as manifest in
a record of foreign travel stunningly low for a child of privilege,
inability to name leaders of key countries, and devotion of only three
pages in his campaign memoir to foreign affairs.57 Although Barack Obama
spent large portions of his life abroad, he had no direct foreign policy
experience before 2008, and his 2012 opponent had even less. So although
[21st-century U.S. presidents have some predetermined beliefs about
foreign policy, their [beliefs]{.mark} are probably]{.underline} more
**[[malleable]{.underline}]{.mark}** than those of presidents who have
come to office more seasoned in matters of state. Some of the most
important, [influential minds may **not prove** to be those most
resistant to change. A third reason for hope can be found in the [early
indications from]{.mark} the [changeover in
**generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Generally speaking, [young people
are more susceptible to the possibility of]{.underline}
**[change]{.underline}**, whereas senior members of any generation are
much less likely to admit that their long‐​held theories might be wrong.
That is particularly true for senior scholars, as Thomas Kuhn has
pointed out in his study of paradigms, because they rarely prove eager
to adjust the belief systems that have served them well for so long.58
Junior members of any field are much more likely to adopt new theories
and beliefs, because they are not as invested in old ways, and they may
gain a certain bit of pleasure in tearing down the old shibboleths.59
[Public‐​opinion [polling]{.mark} has suggested that the youngest
generation of adults]{.underline}, the so‐​called millennials[, is
**[less concerned about terror]{.mark}ism** and **[less supportive
of]{.mark} an [activist fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**]{.underline}
than are its predecessors. Those between the ages of 18 and 29 are half
as likely to be concerned about Islamic fundamentalism as those over
60.60 They also appear to be less patriotic.61 It is often said that
racism is going away one funeral at a time; perhaps, too, generational
change is necessary to relieve some of the pathological popular
pressures in the arena of U.S. foreign policy debate. Finally, it is
worth emphasizing that the target of this work is the marketplace of
ideas, not the beliefs of every individual who contributes to it. The
United States does not always act pathologically, after all. [[Rational
forces]{.mark} are present alongside pathological ones in all foreign
policy discussions, and they **often [win]{.mark}** the [battle]{.mark}
over the direction of policy. It will not require a complete ideological
revolution for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
**[minimize]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[irrational
beliefs]{.underline}]{.mark}** that plague its foreign policy behavior.
[[Planting]{.mark} the **[seeds of doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
influential minds, seeds that can germinate and grow over time, [may
well prove to be enough to tilt the balance of national debate toward
reason]{.underline}. The task of inspiring gradual improvement in U.S.
foreign policy performance, therefore, may not be as daunting as it at
first seems. In the long run, there is hope, even if few minds will
change any time soon. Thomas Jefferson once wrote, "If we think \[the
people are\] not enlightened enough to exercise control with a wholesome
discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform that
discretion."62 [One of the crucial tasks facing policymakers must be to
**inform the general public**]{.underline}, however slowly and
indirectly, of the evidence that might force its members to reexamine
their foreign policy beliefs. Because an informed public is one of the
central sine qua nons of a healthy, functioning democracy, U.S. leaders
ought to repeat the facts about the decline of warfare --- and of the
real risks associated with terrorism --- as many times as necessary for
them to become accepted.63 Although simply correcting misinformation
will not alter beliefs immediately, [over time the constituency for
reason will **grow**]{.underline}.64 Though beliefs are exceptionally
slow to change, they eventually do. [Few people still believe that the
earth is at the **center of the universe**]{.underline}, for instance,
[or that insults to honor must be answered by a **duel to the
death**]{.underline}. [Assuming for a moment that the **[current pacific
trends]{.mark}** in international politics [**turn out to have staying
power**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[empirical
realities]{.underline}**]{.mark} [will]{.underline} eventually
**[[trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** pathological [**geopolitical
[fear]{.mark}**. Even the most deeply held collective beliefs find it
hard to persist forever in the face of a sustained **[onslaught of
countervailing evidence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over time --- and
perhaps with the change of generations --- pure reason can win the
battle of beliefs, even if its victory is never certain.

Reassessing retrenchment's consequences With this more refined
understanding of retrenchment in hand, we can now turn to reassess its
international consequences. As noted in the introduction, [both pundits
and policymakers have long warned of retrenchment's immense costs which
result from the fact that it opens windows of opportunity for rivals to
improve their position in the international system]{.underline}. But
does retrenchment, indeed, regularly pave the way for rivals to acquire
important strategic assets? I argue that it does not. To make this
point, I proceed as follows. I first show that [[it is the]{.mark}
[collapse of]{.mark} a [great power's authority]{.mark}, [not]{.mark}
the [withdrawal of military force]{.mark} per se, [that]{.mark}
[presents]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
then make the case that [great powers engaging in three of the four
types of retrenchment my framework identifies should regularly be able
to avoid precipitating such authority collapse.]{.underline} Finally, I
highlight that [even when great powers engage in the one type of
retrenchment that does create such opportunities for rival gains, there
is good reason to believe that rivals will frequently not be able to
acquire these gains at negligible costs]{.underline}. What invites rival
expansion? Centering great power authority collapse In their warnings
about the dangers of strategic withdrawals, pundits and policymakers
centrally build on the assumption that whenever a great power removes
some its military capabilities from a certain geographic space, this
will open a window of opportunity allowing its rivals to expand their
influence into the area.Footnote33 In this section, I challenge this
popular belief, arguing that it is only when a great power's authority
collapses that the costs for rivals to extend their influence into the
space concerned sink dramatically. Following Weber, authority denotes
the 'legitimate exercise of imperative control' and is a function of
both material capability and legitimacy.Footnote34 The possession of
preponderant coercive capabilities and the ability to use them to issue
coercive threats is the cornerstone of any form of imperative control:
it generates widespread obedience as even those 'subjects who view the
ruler's orders as fundamentally unjust have an interest in compliance if
said orders are backed by preponderant power and the threat of
sanctions'. At the same time, stability and longevity of rule require at
least some degree of legitimacy in the sense that subjects follow the
ruler's commands quasi-voluntarily, i.e. they willingly comply with its
demands for whatever ulterior motivation and therefore do not need to be
constantly monitored and punished.Footnote35 [Historically, great powers
have exercised authority not only over their own homeland but also minor
powers and other political organisations outside of
it]{.underline}.Footnote36 Such cases of spatially extensive authority
in which great powers establish authority over other polities usually
take one of two primary forms. [First, great powers can exercise
authority through the maintenance of a formal empire]{.underline}. In
this constellation, an imperial state or metropole acquires territorial
control over political spaces outside of its own homeland and wields
authority over them as formal colonies or dependencies. Formal empires
thus involve direct rule and formal incorporation into the metropolitan
state.Footnote37 [Second, great powers sometimes exercise authority
without acquiring formal territorial control.]{.underline} [The
political spaces they rule in this manner have variably been called
their 'informal empires' or '[spheres of
influence']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote38 In these cases, a great power
exercises authority not through territorial control but through national
authorities which enter a relationship of subordination with the great
power while still retaining their nominal independence. [Just like
formal empires, these arrangements of imperial control are
[depend]{.mark}ent up[on]{.mark} both pillars of
[authority]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e. not only the ability to inspire a
sufficient degree of willing obedience but also to project preponderant
power into the space concerned. [Consider, for instance, the US sphere
of influence in Latin America]{.underline}: although the United States'
position of predominance does not require a permanent military presence
on the ground as its local subordinates generally comply with its
demands, [the stability of its rule depends crucially on its ability to
enforce its dictates militarily if push came to shove]{.underline}.
[When a great power exercises authority over a political space, this
effectively [limits]{.mark} the [ability of other]{.mark} great
power[s]{.mark} [to 'gain]{.mark} direct [access]{.mark} and control of'
the 'population and territory' it contains]{.underline}, [as rivals
could hope to extend their influence into the space only at tremendous
costs]{.underline}.Footnote39 Seizing authority over another great
power's territorial possessions would be possible only by conquering and
occupying them. Attempts to challenge a great power's control over its
sphere of influence are similarly costly. After all, its hold on
authority over these spaces implies not only that the great power is
able to project preponderant power there, but also that its rule enjoys
sufficient legitimacy. Any adversary seeking to assert control in its
stead must not only expect to trigger a military confrontation with a
peer competitor but also faces the prospect of an indigenous population
that is committed to retaining said peer competitor's rule. In the words
of Eric Forman, [by claiming authority over various geographic spaces
great powers thus erect 'fences or "hard shells" around specific
portions of the globe', effectively shielding them from the influence of
their rivals]{.underline}.Footnote40 [When a great power's authority
over a space collapses, however, this destroys the protective shell
around it]{.underline}. [Such [authority collapse can occur]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [two]{.mark} main [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
possibility is that [[the]{.mark} great [power]{.mark} [loses]{.mark}
large parts of the [material]{.mark} [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
[rule]{.mark}, i.e. it is no longer capable of projecting preponderant
material power]{.underline} into the respective space and is therefore
no longer in a position to fend off outside challenges to its position
of predominance. [The other is that [the]{.mark} [great power
experiences]{.mark} a pronounced [loss in legitimacy]{.mark}, i.e. it
loses its ability to elicit quasi-voluntary compliance with its commands
from subordinate political actors]{.underline}. As the former
subordinates turn away from the great power, they will not only refuse
to defend its rule but might even invite attempts by other powers to
oust and replace it in the hope of thus acquiring greater security or
other material as well as normative benefits for themselves. Overall,
whether the collapse of a great power's authority is due to the erosion
of its ability to project power into the space, its legitimacy, or both,
it radically alters third parties' strategic calculus: specifically, the
great power's peers realise that they now face the unique opportunity to
seek and claim control over a space that was previously impervious to
their rule. [Shifting our analytic focus from the removal of military
capabilities to authority collapse]{.underline} when discussing
strategic withdrawals' likely consequences might at first appear to be
nothing more than a minor semantic move. On closer inspection, however,
it [has far-reaching consequences for how to think about the connection
between retrenchment and possible rival gains]{.underline}. Most
importantly, [it reveals that the [withdrawal]{.mark} [of military
force]{.mark} from a particular space [alone]{.mark} [is neither
necessary nor sufficient to invite]{.mark} [rival]{.mark}
[expansion]{.mark}: it is possible that a great power maintains
authority over spaces outside of its homeland even without a direct
military presence within them, and it is similarly possible that it
loses authority over spaces abroad despite a continued military
presence]{.underline}. As I now turn to show, [[unduly focusing
on]{.mark} the removal of [military power]{.mark} per se [rather
than]{.mark} the collapse of [authority]{.mark} [has thus]{.mark} led
pundits and policymakers [to]{.mark} reach [distorted
assessments]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [retrenchment's
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why many strategic withdrawals do not pave
the way for rival gains All types of retrenchment my framework outlines
entail at least a partial reduction in a great power's military presence
on the ground. Hence, pundits and policymakers have concluded,
retrenchment regularly invites rival expansion. This thinking, however,
is too simplistic. As noted above, windows of opportunities rivals might
exploit emerge when a great power's disengagement causes its authority
to collapse. In this section, I argue that [there are strong reasons to
believe that [great powers engaging in]{.mark} three out of the four
forms of strategic [withdrawal]{.mark} my conceptual framework
identifies -- cutting back, delegating, and downsizing -- [will]{.mark}
often be able to [retain]{.mark} their [authority]{.mark} over the
respective area]{.underline}. [[Consequently]{.mark}, [no opportunities
for rival expansion emerge]{.mark} that would pose a threat to the
retrenching great power's security]{.underline}. In other words, these
forms of retrenchment do not carry the costs strategic withdrawals are
frequently alleged to entail. [Let us, [first]{.mark}, consider [cutting
back]{.mark}, i.e. retrenchment which takes the form of a great power
engaging in a partial military withdrawal from an area outside of its
homeland]{.underline}. When cutting back, [[the]{.mark} retrenching
[great]{.mark} [power]{.mark} continues to [retain]{.mark} at least a
token [force]{.mark} -- and often more than that]{.underline} -- in the
area, [which helps maintain order on the ground and deters outside
challenges to its rule, at a minimum, by functioning as a
tripwire]{.underline}.Footnote41 [In addition, it [continues to
bolster]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} through non-military means such
as the provision of economic aid or diplomatic assurances]{.underline},
[which it might even increase in order to assuage any domestic
opposition]{.underline} against the partial troop withdrawal [and signal
to other parties that it remains committed to the defence of the
area]{.underline}. In principle, great powers should thus be able to
retain their authority when engaging in this type of retrenchment. Given
the limited scope and depth of disengagement cutting back entails, the
risks associated with it are relatively small. Admittedly, it remains a
theoretical possibility that a limited troop withdrawal will set off a
cascade of events through which the great power's authority becomes
significantly weakened.Footnote42 For example, domestic as well as
international observers could perceive it as the prelude to a more
thorough disengagement, conclude that the great power's commitment to
the area is wavering, and thus feel incentivised to challenge its
position of predominance. Yet [the [likelihood]{.mark} [for]{.mark} such
[cascades]{.mark} to occur [appears slim]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[as]{.mark} [the threat of]{.mark} great power [war continues to
loom]{.mark} in the background]{.underline}, [and local actors remain
aware of the great power's continued ability to militarily fend of
challenges to its rule if necessary]{.underline}. Most of the time,
cutting back should thus be possible without worrying about creating
opportunities for rivals to expand their influence abroad. [Second,
[even]{.mark} a [complete]{.mark} troop [withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- such as occurs when delegating -- [[need not precipitate]{.mark} the
[collapse]{.mark} of a great power's authority]{.underline}. As
explained above, [when a great power decides to retrench by delegating,
it essentially attempts to switch from a political arrangement in which
boots on the ground are a key foundation of its control over the area to
one of indirect rule,]{.underline} i.e. in which it continues to
exercise predominant influence in the respective space but does so
remotely, usually by recruiting local political authorities as its
proxies. [The underlying logic of delegation]{.underline} -- and what
makes it so appealing for great powers in the first place [-- is that it
allows them to retain predominant influence while dramatically reducing
the costs of doing so by eliminating the direct military presence on the
ground]{.underline}. The goal is not to rescind one's authority, but to
exercise it through an alternative, less costly arrangement. Put
differently, pursuing delegation is centrally motivated by the goal of
withdrawing military forces without precipitating the kind of authority
collapse rivals might be able to exploit. In principle, delegation of
course carries the risk that the switch to indirect rule fails. Hoping
to exercise the same degree of imperative control as before, the great
power might find that it overestimated its ability to rule from afar.
For instance, local political actors might turn out to be unreliable
either in terms of their will to behave in accordance with the great
power's dictates or in terms of their ability to maintain military
capabilities sufficient to deter outside intervention. Yet, as the
strategic actors that they are, great powers are well aware of this
possibility and will therefore only pursue delegation when they are
near-certain that it will succeed, i.e. they are confident in their
prospective proxy's reliability. What should thus occur more frequently
than great powers pursuing delegation and later finding that it failed
is great powers planning to pursue it, concluding that it is not viable,
and therefore never implementing it. Not coincidentally, there are few
examples in modern history in which great powers pursued delegation and
failed.Footnote43 As an illustrative example, consider US plans for a
full military disengagement from Western and Central Europe after the
conclusion of World War II. It is increasingly well documented that,
from the United States' entry into the war onwards, the leadership in
Washington hoped to avoid any prolonged military entanglement on the
continent.Footnote44 During the war, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that
'the United States will be only too glad to retire all its military
forces from Europe as soon as this is feasible', and throughout the two
following administrations US officials did not give up on the idea that
any direct military involvement on the continent should not be allowed
to become a perpetual one.Footnote45 Yet the United States never
actually implemented a full military withdrawal and -- instead of
pursuing retrenchment as delegation, as initially planned -- US troops
remained on the continent indefinitely after the conclusion of the war.
The key underlying reason for this was that the power differential
between the Soviet Union and the Western European states, despite the
profound aid they had received through the European Recovery Program and
other initiatives, remained too stark as Soviet capabilities soared.
From Washington's perspective, retrenching by delegating was simply not
feasible, and they therefore never engaged in this type of strategic
retrenchment.Footnote46 [[Finally,]{.mark} consider
[downsizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recall that when retrenching by
downsizing a great power initiates a partial military withdrawal and
simultaneously works to reduce its politico-economic involvement in an
area outside of its homeland. [The type of disengagement this form of
retrenchment entails is [encompassing in scope]{.mark}]{.underline} --
it targets both military and non-military foundations of influence --
[[but limited in degree]{.mark}, as the great power neither fully
withdraws its troop presence nor completely abolishes its economic and
diplomatic involvement]{.underline}. Whether this type of retrenchment
will pave the way for rival gains will vary from case to case: it
centrally depends on how large the retrenching great power's remaining
politico-military footprint is after the completion of the downsizing
process. Yet, [given that it [retains]{.mark} a [military
presence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} simultaneously [continues to
utilise]{.mark} other tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit
to a lesser extent) to bolster its relationship with local political
actors, [in many cases the retrenching great power's authority will
likely be somewhat weakened but not erode to the point that outside
actors would feel compelled to compete for control over the
area.]{.underline} [The retrenching great power's [remaining]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} [will]{.mark} help [deter]{.mark} outside
[aggression]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the economic and diplomatic
[support]{.mark} it continues to offer not only [signals]{.mark} its
[continued]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} in shaping the area's political
future but will help [bolster]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} and secure their continued allegiance]{.underline}. In
consequence, while the reductions downsizing entails might, in some
cases, indeed end up being so pronounced that they precipitate a
collapse of authority, there are good reasons to believe that there will
exist just as many cases in which great powers downsize without opening
windows of opportunity for their rivals to exploit. The consequences of
abandonment: Strategic disaster guaranteed? [[But]{.mark} what about the
fourth and most extreme type of retrenchment, i.e. [abandoning]{.mark}?
When a great power decides to abandon a certain part of the world, it
effectively [revokes]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark} over
it.]{.underline} Its military forces are fully withdrawn, it no longer
offers economic or security benefits to incentivise subordination from
local political actors, and thus effectively abolishes the hierarchical
relationship that served as the foundation of its influence. [Given the
all-encompassing scope and depth of this type of retrenchment, it is
essentially unavoidable that it [opens]{.mark} a [window of
opportunity]{.mark} [for other powers]{.mark} to compete for authority
over the respective space]{.underline}. As opposed to those cases in
which the other three types of retrenchment are concerned, prima facie
it therefore appears more plausible to argue that when a great power
retrenches by abandoning it is bound to incur significant costs.
[[Still]{.underline}]{.mark}, [one should be careful not to overestimate
the risks associated with abandonment either]{.underline}. [While the
collapse of the retrenching great power's authority will noticeably
reduce the costs for its rivals to try and claim control]{.underline}
over the space it leaves behind -- most importantly, they must no longer
fear a direct military confrontation with a peer competitor -- [[this
does not]{.mark} [necessarily]{.mark} entail that said costs will be
sufficiently low to [render]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}
[attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When faced]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark} of a great power seeking to claim control over them,
historically, [nation-states]{.mark} have [respond]{.mark}ed not by
appeasing or bandwagoning with the outside power but [by]{.mark}
[balancing]{.mark} against it]{.underline}.Footnote47 Because of these
local balancing dynamics, other great powers seeking to expand their
influence after the retrenching great power's departure are thus [[still
likely to confront a]{.mark} respectable [obstacle that could]{.mark}
prove formidable enough to [deter them]{.mark}]{.underline} from
realising whatever expansionist ambitions they might harbour.Footnote48
Perhaps even more importantly, one should be careful not to take the
above discussion to suggest that abandonment will necessarily represent
a strategic disaster for the retrenching great power. This piece is
primarily concerned with the costs of retrenchment and how they have
been consistently overestimated. Whether retrenchment in any given
instance leads to increases or decreases in a great power's security,
however, depends as much on the benefits it acquires by pursuing this
course of action. In other words, even if retrenchment by abandonment
does open a window of opportunity that is successfully exploited by
rivals which acquire important strategic assets, these costs --
significant as they may be -- might be outweighed by the benefits the
retrenching great power acquires. The latter can include, among others:
a lower likelihood of involving the great power's troops in active
combat; considerably less strain on the great power's economy, on whose
health its power crucially depends in the long run; the ability to
invest more resources to address domestic issues of concern; and freeing
resources to deal with more vital security threat in other regions of
the world.Footnote49 Indeed, being the strategic actors that they are,
we should not observe great powers abandoning certain areas of the globe
unless they are confident that the resultant benefits will ultimately
outweigh the costs they will incur by engaging in this form of
retrenchment.Footnote50

Stories of success: Great power retrenchment in action [Let me now turn
to [the historical record]{.mark} to gather empirical [support]{.mark}
for my argument [that]{.mark} most forms of
[retrenchment]{.mark}]{.underline} -- cutting back, delegating, and
downsizing -- [[do not]{.mark} regularly [create]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark} [for rivals]{.mark} to expand their influence at
significantly lower costs]{.underline}. To show that such cases of
successful retrenchment are more than just a theoretical possibility, I
provide three plausibility probes for my argument, each of which
concerns a different type of retrenchment. First, I investigate the
United States' retrenchment from Korea during the 1970s -- a case of
cutting back -- and show that the troop reductions Nixon implemented did
not undermine US authority over the southern peninsula. Second, I assess
the Soviet Union's retrenchment from Romania during the 1950s -- a case
of delegating -- and find that even though Moscow engaged in a complete
troop withdrawal, this did not undermine its authority. Finally, I take
a look at the United States' retrenchment from Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years -- a case of downsizing -- and show that
it weakened but ultimately did not erode Washington's position of
authority vis-à-vis the region. Before moving on, a brief note about my
empirical approach -- that is, utilising a small number of short case
studies as plausibility probes -- is in order. After all, as Harry
Eckstein notes, 'it is true that case studies have been little used in
political studies as plausibility probes', which 'is largely due to the
fact that the idea of any sort of plausibility probe is foreign to the
field'. The logic behind this approach is that 'after hypotheses are
formulated ... \[a\] stage of inquiry preliminary to testing sometimes
intervenes and ought to do so far more often than it actually does in
political study', namely, 'probing the "plausibility" of
candidate-theories'. Note that 'plausibility here means something more
than a belief in potential validity plan and simple', yet 'also means
something less than actual validity, for which rigorous testing is
required'. Essentially, plausibility probes allow scholars to develop 'a
reasoned, not merely intuitive, "feel" for the odds \[for or\] against a
theory', help 'establish that a theoretical construct is worth
considering', and serve as 'suggestive tests ... before more rigorous
tests are conducted'.Footnote51 Given that the present work's focus lies
on proposing a new theoretical intervention to cast doubt on a widely
held conventional wisdom, it falls beyond its scope to also develop,
conduct, and analyse the kind of extensive empirical tests necessary to
reach a final decree about the contending views' validity. At the same
time, if this piece were to provide no empirical evidence at all, its
central proposition would rightly be rejected as not worthy of serious
consideration. Presenting a number of plausibility probes thus
represents an appropriate 'middle way', and the success of recent IR
studies with similar epistemic aims in utilising this approach should
increase our confidence in its effectiveness.Footnote52 [Cutting back:
The [US retrenchment from Korea]{.mark}, 1970s]{.underline} [Facing the
need to drastically cut the US defence budget]{.underline}, which due to
the Vietnam War had risen to \$81 billion in 1969, [President Nixon
decided to retrench from Korea during the 1970s]{.underline}.Footnote53
Although initially hoping that it might be possible to engage in a full
military withdrawal, the United States quickly realised that this was
not feasible at the moment, even if existing treaty commitments were to
be maintained after the military departure. A key reason for this were
continued South Korean pleas that indigenous capabilities to withstand
an attack from the North were far from sufficient. Accordingly, [at this
time retrenchment from Korea remained decidedly limited in both kind and
degree.]{.underline} In the terminology of the framework developed here,
[it represented a case of cutting back]{.underline}. Nixon's focus lay
exclusively on reducing the US military footprint on the ground, leaving
other sources of influence not only intact but in fact bolstering them,
e.g. by offering additional security assurances and promises of
extensive aid. [Although the United States decided in the spring of 1970
to withdraw roughly 20,000 troops from Korea, it provided President
Park's government with a series of reassurances in]{.underline}
[return]{.underline}. These included 'a pledge not to withdraw any more
troops', a 'written guarantee that the United States would support South
Korea if the North attacked', as well as the promise of 'an additional
\$3 billion worth of military assistance between 1970 and
1975'.Footnote54 In addition, the United States far from eliminated its
military presence on the ground in Korea. To the contrary, its remaining
troop presence continued to play an integral part in its plan to
maintain influence over the southern peninsula. [Precisely [because the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintained]{.mark} a significant
military [presence]{.mark} even after cutting back
and]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in addition, [[increased]{.mark} its use of
non-military tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} to bolster its
relationship with the South Korean government and the latter's ability
to provide for its security, [[the]{.mark} United States'
[decision]{.mark} to cut back from Korea during this time [did not
undermine]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In consequence,
[other powers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and most importantly Soviet
leaders -- [[did not]{.mark} view Washington's [retrenchment as
opening]{.mark} an [opportunity]{.mark} for them to extend their
influence into the area]{.underline}. To the contrary, for observers in
Moscow and beyond, US retrenchment at this time did not bring about a
meaningful change in political conditions. In fact, they essentially
considered it a non-issue. [It was common knowledge that South Korea
continued to fall squarely under the hegemony of the United
States]{.underline}, in both the security and economic realms.Footnote55
In short, after Nixon's decision to cut back from Korea, there was never
any serious worry -- or, from the perspective of US rivals, hope -- that
this might precipitate the erosion of its position of dominance
vis-à-vis South Korea. [No opportunities for rival gains
emerged]{.underline}, as US authority remained soundly intact.
[Delegating: The [Soviet retrenchment from Romania]{.mark},
1950s]{.underline} The previously discussed example of a great power
retrenching by delegating -- the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania in the 1950s -- strikingly demonstrates that this type of
retrenchment need not create opportunities for rival gains either.
Recall that, [following World War II, the Soviet Union centrally relied
on a massive troop presence on the ground to both assert its control
over Eastern Europe]{.underline} and prevent an extension of US
influence into the region. [By the mid-1950s, however, Khrushchev began
to 'seek a more stable and permanent basis of relations with its
satellites']{.underline}. Crucially, 'this did not mean willingly losing
control over them. Instead, it meant making certain readjustments in
order to retain a maximum degree of influence and control, given the
changing circumstances since Stalin's death.'Footnote56 On all counts,
[these efforts to retrench by delegating without seriously undermining
Moscow's position of predominance vis-à-vis Romania [proved
successful]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Despite]{.mark} engaging in a [full
military withdrawal]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} [Soviet]{.mark} [Union]{.mark}
was able to [retain]{.mark} [Romania]{.mark} as part of its sphere of
influence [and avoided]{.mark} leaving [a]{.mark} [window of
opportunity]{.mark} for the West to compete for predominance in this
part of the world]{.underline}. [US leaders concluded from the get-go
that the Soviet Union's complete military withdrawal from the area did
not seriously alter the political circumstances in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} It had done nothing to undermine the Soviet Union's
authority in the region: Romania still fell squarely within the Soviet
Union's sphere of influence. Accordingly, 'in Washington the withdrawal
decision was not thought to be an important Soviet move'. As several US
officials -- including the assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, the assistant secretary of state for policy planning, and the
special assistant for Soviet bloc political-military affairs at the time
-- recounted afterwards, 'the Soviet troop withdrawal was seen as a
minor action with no relevant impact'.Footnote57 The main reason for why
Western observers considered the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania to be geopolitically insignificant is that [it did nothing to
undermine Moscow's position of authority]{.underline}. In the Romanian
government, the Soviet Union had identified a sufficiently reliable
proxy that would willingly comply with its demands. Thanks to its
geographic proximity, it further retained the ability to project power
into Romania even without a direct military presence and could thus
ensure the stability of its influence. Consequently, no window of
opportunity emerged that would have invited competition for control over
the area. Even before the Soviet Union withdrew its troops, Western
intelligence analyses explained along these lines that a 'Soviet
withdrawal alone would be less important than a settlement which allowed
the satellites to pursue at least a neutral policy'.Footnote58 Put
differently, even a complete military withdrawal would be meaningless
since it would do little to undermine the Soviet Union's ability to
control political developments on the ground. Tellingly, the majority of
Romanians themselves shared this assessment, 'perceiv\[ing\] the
development as one of only limited significance'. Diplomatic reports
from Bucharest spoke of the population's 'cynicism', 'skepticism', and
'apathy', indicating that few expected the Russian troop withdrawal to
meaningfully alter political realities on the ground.Footnote59 In
short, all observers -- whether in the Soviet Union, the United States,
or Romania itself -- concurred that the Soviet retrenchment from Romania
did not meaningfully alter the political landscape in Eastern Europe:
Soviet authority over Romania remained intact, and no opportunity
emerged for the West to expand its influence into the region.
[Downsizing: The [US retrenchment from Western]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark},
1990s]{.underline} Finally, let us turn to a case of downsizing, namely,
US efforts to reduce their commitments to Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years. As previously noted, [following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington sought to notably reduce its
politico-military footprint on the continent by engaging in significant
troop reductions and supporting the continent's move towards greater
political autonomy]{.underline}.Footnote60 As Geir Lundestad explains,
several reasons caused the George H. W. Bush administration to embark on
this course. For instance, 'the liberation of Eastern Europe had to be
buttressed financially and commercially and, with Reagan having run up
huge budget and trade deficits, Washington now left much of the
initiative for economic dealings with Eastern Europe to the EC
\[European Community\]'. Even more importantly, further integration of
reunited Germany 'was seen as essential for continued stability'.
Finally, the 'EC was also valuable in the perspective of the American
desire for burden-sharing ... If Washington was to do less in Europe and
more in other parts of the world, the European capitals had to do more
in Europe.'Footnote61 To a notable degree, the decision to grant Europe
greater politico-economic autonomy in the immediate post--Cold War years
paved the way for the emergence of Europe as a political power. As
Moravcsik summarises, by 2010 European integration had 'enjoyed an
astonishingly successful run'. Among other achievements, 'it completed
the single market; established a single currency; created a zone without
internal frontiers ("Schengen"); \[and\] launched common defense,
foreign, and internal security policies'. Consequently, the European
Union emerged 'as a major global force' to be reckoned with.Footnote62
In the words of David Lake, as a result of the increasing autonomy
Western Europe gained in both the economic and security realm,
'America's hierarchies in Europe were clearly waning' following the end
of the Cold War.Footnote63 However, although the United States' new
politico-economic role in Western Europe was thus notably limited
relative to the one it had played during the Cold War, [it would be
fundamentally mistaken to conclude that these developments caused US
authority over Western Europe to erode]{.underline}. While the United
States supported the idea of granting Western Europe an increasingly
independent economic and political role, this did not mean that it
sought to grant full foreign policy autonomy. To the contrary, 'in
Washington the assumption was still that the United States would act as
the undisputed leader, despite the relative rise of Western
Europe'.Footnote64 [Both militarily and economically, [Western Europe
continued to be dependent on]{.mark} close relationships with [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Although the number of US
troops stationed in Europe was cut significantly at the beginning of the
unipolar era, the US military presence in Western Europe remained one of
the largest in the world, exceeding 100,000 until well after the year
2000.Footnote65 US-led NATO continued to play an integral role in
Europe's security structure, and the security guarantee built into it
continues to represent one of the main reasons why Western European
nations appear to see little need to increase their own defence efforts
even today. [For well beyond the post-1990 decade, Washington has thus
been able to exert tremendous influence on the behaviour of Western
European states]{.underline}. Rather than allowing the order which had
served to facilitate cooperation in the West during the Cold War to
collapse, US leaders worked hard to not only maintain but expand it in
the years after 1990. Although the establishment of the 'new world
order', as President Bush came to call it, was centrally inspired by
ideological concerns and motivations, it also represented an
institutional arrangement which would serve to lock in US dominance
vis-à-vis Europe and beyond.Footnote66 This was no coincidence. To the
contrary, the United States consciously moved to maintain its hegemony
over Western Europe even after the fall of the Berlin Wall.Footnote67
Given the remarkable success of these efforts, US authority remained
resolutely intact as the world entered the era of unipolarity.
[Consequently, [no window of]{.mark} [opportunity]{.mark} ever
[materialised]{.mark} that would have allowed either one of the European
states or an outside power to seriously challenge US dominance on the
continent]{.underline}. The United States consciously and successfully
maintained its position of authority and thus Europe's continued pro-US
alignment. Conclusion [It would be an understatement to say that
[retrenchment]{.mark} ha[s]{.mark} a [bad
reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many pundits and policymakers today
believe that great powers which withdraw from commitments abroad
ultimately end up incurring significant costs. Specifically, they argue
that retrenchment opens windows of opportunity rivals can exploit to
expand their influence and acquire important strategic assets, thus
shifting the balance of power in their favour and increasing the
retrenching great power's vulnerability. In this piece, I have argued
that, [while intuitively appealing, these arguments [paint a distorted
picture]{.mark} of retrenchment's consequences, as they consistently
[overestimate]{.mark} its [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}: [they [fail to
appreciate]{.mark} that [retrenchment can take various forms]{.mark},
many of which do not regularly open windows of opportunity for rivals to
capitalise on.]{.underline} In short, the causal relationship
purportedly linking retrenchment to significant rival gains does not
operate as commonly postulated. These findings have important
implications for policymakers today. In particular, they speak to the
current debate surrounding US grand strategy and the question of whether
it would be wise for the United States to retrench from some of its
commitments abroad. This piece suggests that [[it is]{.mark} likely
[possible for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} engage in
some types of strategic [withdraw]{.mark}als [without]{.mark}
[allowing]{.mark} US [rivals]{.mark} such as China or Russia [to
acquire]{.mark} substantial geopolitical [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this vein, the three cases of successful retrenchment discussed in
this piece provide important insights into why and how the great powers
at the time were able to avoid eroding their authority while retrenching
and thus provide a series of valuable lessons for policymakers today.
Three stand out in particular. First, [whenever the troop reductions
implemented were only partial, this served the retrenching great power
well]{.underline}: whether in the case of its withdrawal from Korea
during the 1970s or from Western Europe in the 1990s, the fact that the
United States continued to retain some of its troops on the ground
helped ensure that its position of authority would persist. Said troops
not only served to remind the local populations of the United States'
special interest in -- and ability to shape -- political developments on
the ground, but more importantly deterred outside powers from
challenging US predominance. Second, as the case of the Soviet Union's
retrenchment from Romania shows, [as long as the retrenching great power
retains the ability to project preponderant military force into the area
it leaves, even a full military withdrawal is unlikely to cause the
erosion of its authority]{.underline}. [Local political actors will
realise that]{.underline} -- even in the absence of a direct troop
presence -- [the threat of force always looms in the background. Put
drastically: misbehave, and foreign troops might return]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[third parties]{.mark} that might consider competing for
authority after the troop withdrawal has concluded [will be aware of the
retrenched]{.mark} great [power's ability to come]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the area's [defence]{.mark} if needed]{.underline}. Finally, as
illustrated neatly by the Korean case, [increases in economic and
diplomatic concessions can go a long way towards compensating for troop
reductions]{.underline}. As much as Nixon's decision to reduce the
number of stationed US troops caused anxiety among the South Koreans as
to whether they would be able to rely on the United States going
forward, his decision to combine these cutbacks with new allocations of
aid, a commitment to not withdraw any more troops, as well as a promise
to come to South Korea's aid in the case of an attack from the North,
did much to alleviate said anxiety and thus bolstered the US position
post-retrenchment. Systematically investigating the success conditions
for the various forms of retrenchment beyond the three cases discussed
here represents one of several exciting avenues for future research
opened by the present piece. In addition, scholars might seek to
investigate whether theoretical and policy discussions would benefit
from an even finer-grained conceptual distinction regarding retrenchment
than the one advanced here. Overall, my hope is that, by providing a
novel conceptual framework distinguishing between various types of
international retrenchment, this piece will enable better causal
theorising and thus a more productive debate about the costs and
benefits of great power retrenchment. Only once our discussions of
retrenchment move past simplistic causal associations based on crude
conceptual foundations can we hope to generate solutions to the grand
strategic challenges confronting policymakers in the present moment.

#### Lowering US power in Asia is [better]{.underline} for [deterrence]{.underline}\-\--enables [offshore balancing]{.underline} while [avoiding]{.underline} the [security dilemma]{.underline}

University. Michael C Desch, Balancing Away from War: How the USA and

International Politics, Volume 18, Issue 2, 2025, Pages 151--172,
https://doi.org/10.1093/cjip/poaf001

A balance of power reading of Thucydides suggests that [US\' efforts to
maintain its post-Cold War hegemonic position, either unilaterally or
through broader consent, are bound to fail]{.underline}. [The post-Cold
War "unipolar moment" was not a permanent fact but rather a temporary
artifact of the sudden and unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar
system]{.underline}.187 By virtue of its large population and high level
of economic growth, China was destined to replace the Soviet Union as
another pole in the 21st century international system. The interesting
question is not whether unipolarity will last but will it be replaced
with a bipolar or multipolar system?188 [One of the most important
causes of hegemonic wars in the wake of power transitions is the
security dilemma, the unintended dynamic in which the efforts one state
takes to ensure its security often undermine that of
others]{.underline}.189 While in an anarchical international system, the
security dilemma can never be completely eliminated, it can be mitigated
by the policies states adopt. Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian
War to the breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta
and he applauds Pericles' efforts to try to re-establish it through
restraint rather than replacing Spartan hegemony. [Not only is [a
balance of power]{.mark} grand [strategy]{.mark} [less likely to
exacerbate]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}, it is
eminently more feasible and will better serve American
interests.]{.underline}190 [A balance of power approach by the USA in
its rivalry with China will be effective because it builds upon a number
of well-established tendencies in international
politics]{.underline}.191 Most importantly, [[states]{.mark} tend to
[balance against threats]{.mark}, rather than band wagoning with
them]{.underline}.192 [As China grows more powerful and assertive,
states closest to it are feeling a greater sense of peril]{.underline}.
[Their response will be to seek ways to respond to that threat by
counterbalancing it. [A less]{.mark} [forward]{.mark} and assertive US
[posture will]{.mark} not only mitigate the security dilemma with China
but also [dampen]{.mark} common pathologies of balancing such as
[buck-passing]{.mark} by allies to the larger power and otherwise
under-providing for their own security]{.underline}. [The common problem
behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the propensity of
actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them against its
consequences]{.underline}.193 Some fret that recent Chinese investments
in anti-access/area denial ([[A2/AD]{.underline}]{.mark}) technologies
make it harder for the USA to continue to project power close to China.
However, these same [technologies [could]{.mark} also [bolster]{.mark}
America's beleaguered [allies]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.194
Taiwan, the most probable casus belli, is further from mainland China
than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about the same distance
that Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these relatively short
distances, neither was ever successfully invaded. [Today, [China will
have to project power across water]{.mark}, always [a]{.mark} [dicey
proposition]{.mark} but one made even harder now if US allies in the
region invest in their own A2/AD technologies to preserve the balance of
power.]{.underline} [Donald [Trump's]{.mark} return to the White House
raises the question of whether he [might be]{.mark} more
[amenable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [replacing]{.mark} America's long-standing
[Primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} approach to maintaining the status quo in
the Western Pacific with one premised upon a balance of power?195 [There
are]{.underline}, in fact, [grounds for thinking that Trump might
be]{.underline}. The latter approach would not seek to prevent any
change in the region, only those that threaten the global balance of
power. [During his first term in office, he [adopted]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
more "[transactional approach]{.mark} \[which\] often differed from his
team's competitive approach."]{.underline}196 [To be sure, the recently
re-elected former President has not shied away from economic
competition]{.underline} with China and has shown little compunction
about rattling the tariff saber and even threatening a trade war. [But
he seems "[ambivalent]{.mark}" [about]{.mark} embracing the American
China [hawks']{.mark} commitment to defend Taiwan against China if it
seeks independence]{.underline}.197 Hardly anyone would compare the
former and future President to the great Athenian leader Pericles, but
[it is entirely possible that Trump might at least embrace a Periclean
balance of power approach as a way out of the Thucydides'
Trap]{.underline}. Thucydides' fundamental lessons for the contemporary
USA in its rivalry with China is that democratic Athens erred when it
grasped for primacy by expanding its empire during the Peloponnesian
War; [today [America]{.mark} does not need to preserve a position of
primacy in East Asia but [can]{.mark} instead [rest content]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} maintaining a [balance of power]{.mark}
there]{.underline}. Indeed, [the tragedy of Thucydides' account is that
neither Athens nor Sparta appreciated the limits imposed upon their
striving for primacy by the balance of power]{.underline}.198 [The best
grand strategy for the contemporary USA]{.underline} I believe, and the
Thucydidean approach I know, [favors the more restrained balance of
power approach for the USA to manage its rivalry with China in this
century]{.underline} without blundering into the "Thucydides' trap."

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on **faith alone**]{.underline}.41 [There is **precious
little evidence** to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [[the world remained]{.mark} **equally
[peaceful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [[while the

casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of [Africa]{.mark} would be unlikely to
attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
**intervention**]{.underline}. [The continent [is]{.mark},
**nevertheless**, **more [peaceful]{.mark} today** than at **any other
time** in its history]{.underline}, [something for which U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony **[cannot take credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.43
[[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in]{.mark} **many such
[places]{.mark}** [to which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony **simply
[does not extend]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Overall, [proponents of the
**stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the
most **basic observations** from **cognitive psychology**]{.underline}:
[**rarely** are our actions as important to others' calculations as we
**perceive them to be**]{.underline}.44 [The]{.underline} so‐​called
**[egocentric bias]{.underline}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in
human interaction, [suggests that although it may be **natural** for
[U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as crucial in the
maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is. The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple
of factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [Americans have long been
**exceptional** in their **exceptionalism**]{.underline}.45 [The short
history of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can
easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story
of success, [has led to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it
is **morally, culturally**, and **politically superior** to other,
lesser countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional
state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the
world. [Americans have always combined that feeling of **divine
providence** with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the
world and **battle evil**]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that
sense of destiny, of being the object of history's call, that most
obviously separates the United States from other countries. Only an
American president would claim that by entering World War I, "America
had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the
world."46 Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no
other seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in
quite the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants
everybody to be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I
believe. And that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine
Albright called the United States the "indispensable nation," she was
reflecting a traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48
Exceptional nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to
assist the merely average. Many of the factors that contribute to
geopolitical fear --- Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested
interests, and neoconservatism --- also help explain American
exceptionalism and the indispensability fallacy. And unipolarity makes
hegemonic delusions possible. With the great power of the United States
comes a sense of great responsibility: to serve and protect humanity, to
drive history in positive directions. More than any other single factor,
the people of the United States tend to believe that they are
indispensable because they are powerful, and power tends to blind states
to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our international behavior and our
image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It brings with it the freedom to make
wide‐​ranging choices well beyond common sense."49 [It is quite likely
that the world **does not need the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to enforce peace]{.underline}**. In fact,
[if **virtually any** of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing
[explanations for]{.mark} the current [stability]{.mark} are correct,
the trends in international security may well [prove **difficult to
reverse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[No]{.mark}ne** of the **contributing
[factors]{.mark}** that are commonly [suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(**[economic development]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, complex
[**interdependence**, **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**,
international [**institutions**, **democracy**]{.mark}, **shifting
global [norms]{.mark}** on war]{.underline}) [seem **poised to
[disappear]{.mark}** any time soon]{.underline}.50 [[The world
will]{.mark} probably **[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline} its
[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}ful ways for the near future, at the very
least, [**no matter what** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

#### PLA modernization is [defensive]{.underline}. But, US military strength causes action-reaction spirals that escalate

Military Competition Heightens Security Dilemmas [The most acute and
high-profile dimension of the China challenge is the PLA's rise as a
military power of the first rank. The most tangible danger comes from
policies that encourage China to grow or use that power]{.underline}.
[Over roughly the past two decades, Chinese industrial policy has
evolved from an emphasis on economic development to national security
and autonomy]{.underline}.75 In parallel, [the PLA has been increasing
its military capabilities and shaping its force structure in a manner
that garners alarmist headlines from Western media and
pundits]{.underline}. [The two most important changes in China's
military are its navy and its nuclear arsenal---both have expanded to
degrees that are undeniable and highly complicating for Western military
analysts seeking military solutions to what are deeply political
problems.]{.underline}76 [The purpose of the PLA's naval expansion must
be understood in relation to U.S. military primacy. The operational
concept at the heart of PLA warfighting, what U.S. analysts call
"anti-access/area denial" ([A2/AD]{.mark}), [aims]{.mark} [to keep
the]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} military pinned down or [out of a
theater]{.mark} of combat while the PLA undertakes a mission against
some third territory]{.underline} in Asia.77 [[It is not]{.mark} a
military doctrine [capable of]{.mark} facilitating global
[conquest]{.mark} or even regional domination]{.underline}. [And it is
not designed to take over the United States or U.S. territory.
[Rather]{.mark}, A2/AD is a concept that [aims to counter]{.mark} the
advantages of U.S. [power projection]{.mark} in the event that U.S. and
Chinese forces clash in the latter's geographic
periphery.]{.underline}78 [China's nuclear expansion, meanwhile, has a
similar relational quality.]{.underline} [For a generation, [China
sustained]{.mark} a posture of nuclear "[minimum
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}"---a term of art referring to a strategy
of having just enough of a nuclear arsenal to be capa- ble of assured
nuclear retaliation in the event China is attacked with nuclear
weapons.79 In effect, China's nuclear weapons are primarily for
deterrence of nuclear attack. [Over the past decade, however, China has
rapidly accelerated its nuclear modernization.]{.underline} Since the
Trump years, China has constructed more than 200 missile siloes (we do
not know how many have warheads and how many are simply intended to
complicate U.S. targeting) and upward of 350 nuclear weapons as of 2023.
The Pentagon estimates that, at its current pace, the PLA could have
1,000 warheads by 2030.80 [It is also improving the lethality of its
arsenal]{.underline}, testing hypersonic missiles and a fractal orbital
bombardment system (FOBS)---a way of delivering warheads that defeats
early-warning radars and missile defenses.81 [At the nuclear level,
scholars judge that neither country has the desire to launch a first
strike, yet the nature of today's technologies and Sino-U.S. nuclear
postures have locked the two countries in a structural security
dilemma]{.underline}. Recent research shows that "[the shift in the
conventional balance of force in the region and the [U.S.]{.mark}
development of [low]{.mark}er-[yield]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [has led to]{.mark} greater [fears]{.mark} in China [of
U.S. limited]{.mark} nuclear [use]{.mark} in a conflict]{.underline}.
[Chinese strategists increasingly believe that U.S. nonnuclear strategic
capabilities threaten China's nuclear forces.]{.underline}"82 As the
U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed in 2023,
"Beijing worries that bilateral tension, U.S. nuclear modernization, and
the PLA's advancing conventional capabilities have increased the
likelihood of a U.S. \[nuclear\] first strike."83 [China is thus
expanding its [nuclear]{.mark} arsenal because it fears Washington might
launch nuclear strikes first]{.underline}. [The [modernization]{.mark}
of its nuclear program is a rational response to this
situation;]{.underline} [more, and more diverse, nuclear capabilities
are [necessary to ensure the PLA can retaliate]{.mark} with nuclear
weapons to U.S. nuclear first-use]{.underline}. [Expanding nuclear
capabilities from a position of inferiority, in other words, serves the
same prior goal of "minimum deterrence" but in a context where U.S.
nuclear modernization]{.underline} (priced at more than \$1.7 trillion
over thirty years and dating back to the Obama administration) [changes
the minimum capability required for deterrence]{.underline}. What makes
all this a security dilemma is that, like Chinese officials, most U.S.
policymakers have no desire to escalate to nuclear first use, and yet
the prospect of it remains all the same. To make sense of the risks of
nuclear and conventional war, we need to hold in our minds two truths at
once. [At a global, abstract level, the United States enjoys a favorable
balance of power---overwhelming military dominance relative to all other
powers. However, at a local, concrete level in Asia--- specifically
[across the]{.mark} Taiwan [Strait]{.mark}---[the b]{.mark}alance
[o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}ower [shifted]{.mark} in favor of the PLA over
[a]{.mark} [decade]{.mark} ago.]{.underline} [The correlation of forces
across the Taiwan Strait tilts against the United States [because
of]{.mark} [geography]{.mark}.]{.underline} Taiwan sits just off China's
coast but it is 5,200 miles away from Hawai'i and 6,600 miles away from
California. Moreover, [all of Taiwan is within range of China's
integrated air defense systems [(IADS]{.mark}),]{.underline} [meaning
there is no possibility of the United States achieving air superiority
in Taiwan without disabling China's IADS]{.underline}. [[And]{.mark}
given China's [large]{.mark} surface and undersea
[fleets]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there is no way to establish sea control
or sea denial off China's coast without attacking ports and critical
infrastructure on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. [[These must
be]{.mark} [design constraints on]{.mark} U.S. defense
[strategy]{.mark}, not opportunities for arms-racing]{.underline}.
[[Any]{.mark} traditional [warfighting scenario in Taiwan is a
loser]{.mark}, requiring a massive number of missile strikes against
targets on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. Despite obsessive
war-gaming, [the United States has never come up with a plausible
scenario in which it can launch repeated salvos against Chinese
territory without escalating to nuclear war]{.underline}. No matter what
weapons the United States buys or builds, it cannot dominate the Taiwan
Strait militarily the way it can elsewhere in the world. But it does not
necessarily need to. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been
living with]{.mark} an [unfavorable]{.mark} correlation of
[forces]{.mark} in Taiwan for some time [and]{.mark} the situation [has
been stable,]{.mark} because the calculation of the balance]{.underline}
(who has the upper hand in a nightmare scenario) [is a separate
analytical question from what a state does with its share of the balance
at any given point]{.underline}. [Xi Jinping has said a U.S.-led
campaign of "containment and suppression" of China has "brought
unprecedented, severe challenges," rallying Chinese citizens to "dare to
fight."]{.underline}84 [It is a clear expression of resolve---a
willingness to fight, even jingoism--- but not a willingness to launch a
preventive war]{.underline}. [[China is]{.mark}
inhibited---[deterred]{.mark}---from launching an invasion of Taiwan
because it would be costly in even the best case]{.underline}. [The
United States is similarly deterred from wish-casting for war in Taiwan
because that would be unwinnable]{.underline} in any conventional sense.
The situation is thus a security dilemma, which military policies can
escalate but cannot remedy. [Arguments that the United States needs to
proliferate weapons to allies, build more bases, or accumulate missiles
to fire from standoff range in order to "hold China at risk" are missing
the forest for the trees]{.underline}---you do those things either for
an unwinnable nuclear war, or you do them in the name of deterrence.
[But while the risks of such moves are obvious, the benefits of "more
deterrence" are not. Even without a U.S. military buildup, China has
remained deterred---despite it retaining a favorable balance of power
over Taiwan---for more than a decade.]{.underline} If deterrence holds
as a status quo, then America's foremost priority ought to be not
putting deterrence itself in jeopardy. Instead, [U.S. policy is [seeking
primacy]{.mark}---that is, to retain a favorable imbalance of power,
including in the Taiwan Strait, where that is not possible]{.underline}.
It is [positioning U.S. forces to encircle China]{.underline}---an
accusation that China had been making against the United States for more
than a decade but that, since the Trump years, has become a reality.
[And it is proliferating weapons to allies and partners throughout Asia,
[buoying]{.mark}---rather than arresting---the military
[modernization]{.mark} [trend]{.mark} across the region that
[heightens]{.mark} [mistrust]{.mark} [and]{.mark} confuses war
preparation with war prevention.]{.underline} [The United States may be
undertaking all of this with defensive motives]{.underline}---rational
U.S. officials do not seek open conflict---[but these moves are as bad
for deterrence as they are for democracy. Individually and collectively,
they [exacerbate]{.mark} [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}
[dynamics]{.mark} and encourage all the choices from China that the
United States claims not to want.]{.underline}

#### But even if they're right, revisionist states are [only]{.underline} dangerous when they've [just had their ambitions denied]{.underline}\-\--the plan creates the only scenario for great power war 

Hal **Brands 18**, the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins-SAIS, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, 10/24/18, "Danger: Falling Powers,"
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/10/24/danger-falling-powers/>

There is, then, no disputing that [rising powers can have profoundly
disruptive effects. Yet such powers **might not**]{.underline} actually
[**be the most aggressive or risk-prone** type of revisionist
state]{.underline}. After all, [[if a country's position is]{.mark}
steadily [improving]{.mark} over time, [why risk]{.mark} messing it all
up through reckless policies that precipitate a premature
[showdown?]{.mark}]{.underline} Why not lay low until the geopolitical
balance has become still more favorable? [[Why not]{.mark} wait until
one has [surpass]{.mark}ed [the]{.mark} reigning [hegemon]{.mark}
altogether and other countries defer to one's wishes **[without a
shot]{.mark} being fired[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} So [while a rising
revisionist power may be tempted to assert itself, it
should]{.underline} also [have good reason to avoid going for
broke]{.underline}. Now [[imagine]{.mark} an alternative]{.underline}
scenario. [[A revisionist power]{.underline}]{.mark}---perhaps an
authoritarian power---[has been [gaining influence]{.mark} and
ratcheting its ambitions upward. [Its leaders]{.mark} have
[cultivated]{.mark} intense [nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
pillar of their domestic legitimacy; they have [promised the
populace]{.underline} that [past insults will be avenged and [sacrifices
will be rewarded with]{.mark}]{.underline} geopolitical greatness and
[**[global prestige]{.mark}**. Yet [then the country]{.mark}'s potential
[peaks]{.mark}]{.underline}, either because it has reached its natural
limit or because of some unforeseen development, [and the balance of
[power]{.mark} starts to [shift in unfavorable
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. It becomes clear to the country's leadership
that it may not be able to accomplish the goals it has set and fulfill
the promises it has made, and that the situation will only further
worsen with time. [[A **roll of the iron dice**]{.mark} now
[seems]{.mark} more attractive: It may be [the only chance]{.mark} the
nation has [to claim]{.mark} geopolitical [spoils]{.mark} before it is
too late]{.underline}. In this scenario, [[it is **not rising power**
that makes the revisionist]{.mark} state so [dangerous, but]{.mark} the
**[temptation to act before decline sets in]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this sense, the dynamic bears a resemblance to the famous Davies J-Curve
theory of revolution, wherein a populace is held to be more inclined to
revolt not when it is maximally oppressed but rather when raised
expectations are shown to be in vain. Obviously, [rational analysis does
not always prevail]{.underline} in world politics. Rising states can
become intoxicated with their own strength; they may simply get tired of
waiting to attain the status they desire; or some domestic pressure may
impel leaders to act dangerously. [But revisionists whose power has
begun to decline, or who have hit a rogue bump in the road,]{.underline}
**[may not feel that they even have the option of
waiting]{.underline}**.

post-Warsaw Pact [states]{.mark} that are already [in NATO,]{.mark}

**[[consistently denied]{.underline}]{.mark}** [any [plans to **attack

[any]{.mark} **ostensible [reason]{.mark}** [to **do

no geopolitical interest, neither **economic**, **political** nor
military]{.underline} [--- to fight with NATO countries," Putin said in
late 2023. 11]{.underline} "Their statements about our alleged intention
to attack Europe after Ukraine is sheer nonsense," he claimed in early
2024. 12 Though [the [Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline} espouses consistent

territory]{.underline}. These goals were spelled out in Russia's
December 2021 security ultimatum to the West, which called for written
guarantees against NATO's further eastward enlargement and limits on
deployments of troops and weapons on NATO's eastern flank. 13 The 2021
ultimatum remains the purest articulation of Russia's aims toward the
West --- not a war of conquest, but a grand bargain that establishes
concrete limits to NATO's force posture in Eastern Europe and explicitly
acknowledges Russia's right to a cultural, political, and military
sphere of influence in the post-Soviet region. [Though the
[Kremlin]{.mark} espouses consistent hostility toward NATO, it appears
to [realize]{.mark} that [it could not achieve]{.mark} its goals toward
