#### Plan: The United States federal government should significantly increase funding for space-based operations in the Arctic.

## AD 1: Peer competitors

#### US military operations are hindered by a lack of assets and infrastructure in the Arctic

**Savitz and Tingstad, 2023** (Scott Savitz is a senior engineer at the
nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. Abbie Tingstad is an adjunct
senior researcher at RAND, 12-21-2023, \"The U.S. Military Needs to
Build Arctic Capabilities and Capacity\", No Publication,

**[The U.S. military\'s ability to operate effectively in the Arctic is
impeded by various factors.]{.underline}** As we described in a recent
report, chief among these are the fact that **[it has so few assets that
can operate in the region and so little infrastructure
there,]{.underline}** particularly in comparison with Russia.
**[Increased investments in platforms, infrastructure, equipment,
communications, multidomain awareness, and enhanced tactics and training
would enable the United States to better secure its critical
interests]{.underline}** in the Arctic.

These interests span the vast Arctic region: **[the United States needs
to work alongside NATO allies to secure North America\'s Arctic
approaches and its European allies\' long, vulnerable Arctic coastlines
and borders with Russia. It also has a key interest in countering
Russian submarines at the Arctic\'s edge]{.underline}**, where the gaps
between Greenland, Iceland, and Britain are gateways for Russian
submarines to enter the Atlantic. **[The United States also has homeland
security responsibilities within its own Arctic territory and waters,
where thousands of Americans live. This area also harvests roughly half
of the nation\'s seafood, plus substantial amounts of oil, zinc, and
other resources]{.underline}**. As sea ice abates during parts of the
year, the Arctic\'s maritime routes are becoming increasingly important
shortcuts between oceans.

The importance of the region to overall U.S. interests is highlighted in
the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region
(PDF), released in October 2023, and in the 2022 National Security
Strategy (PDF). It was also underscored by the U.S. Coast Guard\'s
publication of its Arctic Strategic Outlook Implementation Plan just a
week ago. Although Coast Guard operations in the Arctic are particularly
visible to civilians, the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Space
Force also conduct training, exercises, and operations there.

**[Challenges from both Russia and China underscore the urgency of
improving Arctic military capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Russia was
building up its Arctic military and civilian capabilities in the years
before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This included re-opening
Arctic bases that had closed after the Cold War, conducting more
extensive training and exercises, stationing more forces in the Arctic,
and operating more throughout the region]{.underline}**. It also has
over 50 polar icebreakers, far more than any other country. The United
States, by comparison, currently has two, though more are being
acquired.

**[China has also become increasingly involved in the
region]{.underline}**. Both of its polar icebreakers have been
extensively collecting information on the Arctic\'s physical
environment**[. It has invested, or tried to invest, in Arctic
properties from Greenland and Europe to Siberia, and has secured the
diplomatic status of an observer at the Arctic Council. In an effort to
achieve a greater role in the Arctic, China has alternately referred to
itself as a "near-Arctic state" and to the Arctic as a shared
environment belonging to all nations]{.underline}**, neither of which is
accurate. Beijing\'s increasing collaboration with Moscow across all
areas has also been deepening in the Arctic. The two countries have
operated naval vessels together in the approaches to Alaska during the
last few summers, and also recently signed a maritime law enforcement
agreement that facilitates further Arctic collaboration.

**[For the United States, Arctic-specific capabilities are needed
because of the effect of the region\'s unique environment on operations.
Any system that was not specifically designed for that environment is
likely to fail: fuels gel, materials shatter, lubricants freeze, and
batteries do not work. The environment is even harder on people, who
struggle just to survive in extreme temperatures. Arctic operations are
further impeded by the region\'s tremendous internal distances and its
remoteness from the rest of the world. Sparse infrastructure that is
relentlessly battered by the elements, limited satellite coverage, and
unique electromagnetic effects that degrade communications also
contribute to challenges]{.underline}**. Climate change is also
degrading coastal infrastructure and contributing to less predictable
conditions.

#### Space based assets key to Arctic readiness 

**Erwin, 2024** (Sandra Erwin, veteran defense journalist, 7-22-2024,
\"Pentagon\'s Arctic strategy emphasizes space and satellite
capabilities\", SpaceNews,
<https://spacenews.com/pentagons-arctic-strategy-emphasizes-space-and-satellite-capabilities/>,
DoA 6/6/2025, DVOG)

The Department of Defense released its **[2024 Arctic
Strategy]{.underline}**, addressing the increasing geopolitical and
environmental challenges in the Arctic region.

The strategy, which directs the U.S. military to "build readiness for
operations at high latitudes," **[emphasizes the increasing reliance on
satellites for critical activities in the Arctic]{.underline}**. As
climate change reshapes the region's landscape and geopolitical
dynamics, **[the Pentagon is calling for investments in space-based
capabilities to enhance communications, intelligence gathering and
monitoring activities.]{.underline}**

Geopolitical concerns

The United States views the Arctic region as one of strategic power
competition in light of Russia's significant presence and efforts by
China to expand its influence there.

A key trend highlighted in the document is China's ambition to expand
its footprint in the Arctic through infrastructure investments and an
increased military presence. Additionally, Russia's military
capabilities in the Arctic pose potential threats to the U.S. and its
allies. The strategy notes that Russia's collaboration with China in the
region is on the rise, further complicating the security landscape.

**[DoD points out the role of the Arctic in missile warning and defense
of the U.S. homeland]{.underline}**. While the current network of U.S.
and Canadian radars and sensors operated by NORAD and U.S. Northern
Command enables the detection and tracking of certain threats,
**[modernization is needed, including space-based missile-warning and
observational systems with greater polar coverage]{.underline}**," the
strategy says.

**[Communications in the Arctic have long posed challenges for military
operations due to limited satellite coverage. The strategy calls for
both military and commercial solutions to improve tactical and strategic
communications]{.underline}**. It emphasizes the need for agreements
with NATO allies and partners to enhance satellite coverage in the
region.

**[DoD also will need space-based technologies to better predict and
model the Arctic's rapidly changing meteorological, atmospheric, and
oceanographic conditions]{.underline}**, says the document.

#### Robust Arctic space presence key to check Russia and China 

**Marsh, 2025** (Dave Marsh, technical advisor at the Wilson Center
Polar Institute, 1-8-2025, \"Why the space community should care about
Arctic geopolitics\", SpaceNews,
<https://spacenews.com/why-the-space-community-should-care-about-arctic-geopolitics/>,
DoA 6/3/2025, DVOG)

As tourism increases, diminishing sea ice opens new trade routes, and
geopolitical rivals maneuver, **[whoever maintains influence over the
Arctic region stands to gain economic and strategic
benefits.]{.underline}** U.S. Army Air Corps founder Billy Mitchell once
said: "whoever holds Alaska will hold the world." He meant this due to
its proximity by air to strategic bombing targets (90% of the world's
industrial centers are within 10 hours from Anchorage), but his words
apply to space and the broader Arctic region**[. Continuous command,
control and surveillance of orbiting spacecraft requires a resilient
presence in the Arctic. Polar ground stations, whether military, civil,
or commercial, are the only facilities available for a downlink every
orbit for satellites in polar or sun-synchronous inclinations. Modern
military operations are increasingly dependent on polar-orbiting
satellites, from weather monitoring, to communications, to imaging and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; even for potential
navigation alternatives to GPS. Russian satellites often use Molniya or
Tundra orbits, which are highly elliptical paths that result in longer
dwell times over high latitudes --- and require an Arctic facility to
keep tabs on them. In a conflict, the Space Force will need unbroken
access to these critical capabilities.]{.underline}**

The Space Force currently operates two Arctic facilities that provide
missile warning and space surveillance capabilities: Pituffik Space
Base, formerly known as Thule, in northern Greenland; and Clear Space
Force Station, which lies just below the Arctic Circle in central
Alaska. While Clear is secure deep within inland Alaska, an independence
movement in Greenland or an American departure from NATO might require a
bilateral renegotiation of the Space Force presence in Pituffik.

NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
operate other ground stations in Alaska for the Near Space Network,
Landsat missions, while a number of distributed commercial ground
stations are used to communicate with commercial polar-orbiting
satellites. The world's largest satellite ground station is in Svalbard,
Norway, operated by the Norwegian company Kongsberg Satellite Services
(KSAT). The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) also operates commercial
ground stations in northern Sweden, Alaska and the Northwest Territories
of Canada. The aptly-named startup Arctic Space Technologies has
developed a "hyperscale"-capable satellite ground station in Sweden,
just below the Arctic Circle. The ability to access, maintain, support
and defend all these Arctic installations is critical for constant
command and control of allied space assets and continuous tracking of
adversary space activities.

**[The Arctic also plays a role in launch capabilities. The U.S. and
Russia both possess near-Arctic launch sites optimal for placing small
payloads into polar orbits]{.underline}** --- the Pacific Spaceport
Complex on Kodiak Island, Alaska, and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
Arkhangelsk, respectively --- which could become key assets for rapidly
reconstituting space capabilities during a global conflict. Norway's
Andøya Space Center, located above the Arctic Circle at 69 degrees
North, is set to become the first operational orbital launch facility in
continental Europe sometime this year. Sweden's Esrange Space Center, at
68 degrees North, is close behind. Canada's best option for an orbital
launch site, the Canso, Nova Scotia, facility operated by Maritime
Launch, is also suited for launching polar-orbiting satellites, even
though it lies further to the south.

**[Russia operates dozens of Arctic military facilities, many of which
contribute to space command, control, and surveillance functions. But
Beijing also understands the role that geography plays in space command
and control, operating a fleet of satellite command ships]{.underline}**
and a ground station in Argentina (which is directly antipodal to
mainland China). China is expanding its presence in the Arctic,
publishing its first Arctic Strategy in 2020 and sending three
icebreakers into the Arctic Ocean this summer. In 2020, former General
Counsel of the U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Tom Ayres wrote in SpaceNews
about the risk posed by China securing physical infrastructure in the
region. Today, Beijing operates a handful of Arctic research facilities
with dual-use and space applications, in Svalbard, Norway; Iceland and
Greenland itself.

AI will undoubtedly play a role in future warfare. Recent developments,
like Palantir's partnerships with Voyager Space and Anduril have further
tied AI to military space. If "data is the fossil fuel of AI," as OpenAI
co-founder Ilya Sutskever recently described it, then satellites are the
pipelines that gather and route data --- and Arctic facilities are the
pipelines' vulnerable terminals.

These facilities, then, must be resilient. While **[the
administration]{.underline}** may not be able to close a deal to
purchase Greenland, it **[should seek to expand the American presence in
the Arctic for space applications --- and secure access through
international partnerships where possible. Any space organization,
whether national security, civil, or commercial, should understand its
"Arctic exposure" for contingency planning, and explore cost-effective
ways to proliferate, distribute, or reinforce Arctic-based capabilities.
Commercial space services, whether satellite communications, mobile or
distributed ground stations, alternative space-based navigation,
in-orbit space domain awareness, or even re-entry capsules, can all
support remote Arctic operations.]{.underline}**

The loss of Pituffik Space Force Base, the deactivation of an Arctic
commercial ground station, or the activation of a Chinese military space
facility in the region would all have serious consequences for both a
future conflict and business as usual in orbit. Everyone in the space
community, whether industry, government, or military, should therefore
pay close attention to Arctic political developments in 2025. 

#### Scenario 1 is Russia:

#### Russia's rapid militarization of the Arctic seeks to turn it into a conflict zone

**[Russia has been quietly investing in Arctic military and industrial
infrastructure for the last decade.]{.underline}** Russia's expanded
Arctic presence is **[part of]{.underline}** President Vladimir
**[Putin's efforts to elevate Russia's position on the world
stage.]{.underline}** The current age has seen relatively low-tension in
the region, but this may be coming to an end. Russia has reopened Soviet
military bases and expanded the navy's Northern Fleet. **[Russia seeks
to increase its military power in the Arctic to enhance homeland defense
and secure Russia's economic future by attracting international
investment.]{.underline}**

**[Melting sea ice intensifies competition in the Arctic]{.underline}**.
Climate change is increasing accessibility to the Northern Sea Route.
Increased Arctic traffic heightens the potential for competition around
physical access and resources. Moscow views securitizing the region
through military activity as a prerequisite for controlling its
interests in the rapidly changing Arctic. Russia has encouraged energy
companies to increase exploration activities in the Arctic to reap the
economic benefits of reserves being uncovered by melting Arctic ice.

**[Russia sees its assertive military posture as a response to
NATO]{.underline}**'s presence in the region, as several NATO members
hold territory in the Arctic. Former NATO commander Adm. James Stavridis
acknowledges that t**[he Arctic is a "zone of competition" that has the
potential to devolve into a "zone of conflict.]{.underline}**" Russia's
militarization of the Arctic has pushed Arctic and NATO countries to
call for the preservation of the Arctic as a 'low tension' area.
**[Growing tensions with the West risks miscommunication that could lead
to conflict or an even more assertive Russian military posture in the
Arctic.]{.underline}**

53% of the Arctic coastline belongs to Russia. Its Arctic military bases
are concentrated mostly around Murmansk Oblast, but in recent years
Russia has expanded capabilities in the High North. Russia has taken
full advantage of its arctic territory. Wrangel Island, Cape Schmidt,
and Kotelny Island developments are right across the Bering Strait from
Alaska. Visualizing Russia's Arctic presence shows the density of
Russia's military infrastructure in the region.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin has a worldview that **differs
substantially** from]{.underline} that of [his Western counterparts and
**a grand strategy** to expand Russia's **power and
control**---necessarily at the expense of others]{.underline}. Putin's
worldview is evident in his statement that the collapse and breakup of
the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the
twentieth century. Russia, in his view, was humiliated in the wake of
that devolution. [He views the West as **the culprit and a continuing
threat** to his vision for Russia. Putin has]{.underline} often [used
**powerful and even spiritual imagery** to convey his messages to the
Russian people]{.underline}. For example, in his 2014 annual address to
the Russian Federal Assembly, Putin cited the religious significance of
Crimea---the place where "Grand Prince Vladimir \[born in Kiev circa 956
AD\] was baptized before bringing Christianity to Rus." And, [he
compared the significance of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia to the
"**sacral importance**" of the "**Temple Mount in Jerusalem** for the
followers of Islam and Judaism."]{.underline}1 Vladimir [Putin and
**other like-minded Russian leaders** appear determined to correct
**perceived injustices**]{.underline} done to Russia. [**This
revisionist agenda** is]{.underline} to be [accomplished at the expense
of **the West---in particular, the United States**]{.underline} and
allies. The [evidence for this thesis is apparent from consistencies in
**Russian leadership statements** and Russia's behavior over **the past
20 years**]{.underline}. As summarized by Secretary of Defense Ashton
Carter in October 2015: Russia has used political, economic, and
military tools to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
neighboring countries, flouted international legal norms, and
destabilized the European security order by attempting to annex Crimea
and continuing to fuel further violence in eastern Ukraine.2 Russian
Objectives. [**Moscow's grand strategy** and]{.underline} identified key
objectives [include: expanding]{.underline} its [influence]{.underline}
and reestablishing its global role [as **a multi-regional great
power**]{.underline} and "Russification" of the near abroad. U.S.
leaders should be aware that [these objectives are not achievable in
**an era of peace and stability**, but are **highly revisionist and
confrontational**. Russian actions]{.underline} toward these goals,
**[if unchecked]{.underline}**, invariably [will lead to **further
crises and conflict**]{.underline} with the West. The [territorial
expansion which is]{.underline} sought by Moscow [has been
**demonstrated clearly** in Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine]{.underline},
and [**future incursions** by Russian]{.underline} military
[forces]{.underline} could well [erupt into **a serious confrontation**
with the West]{.underline}. In fact, with Putin's invasion of Ukraine
and Russian military operations in Syria, [Russia]{.underline} has
[demonstrated the]{.underline} potential [threat]{.underline} to states
[from the Baltic to the Black Sea and the Balkans]{.underline}. Russia
has declared repeatedly that it views NATO as its enemy and large-scale
military exercises conducted over the past decade have underscored the
seriousness of that Russian perspective of NATO. Russia's expansion of
influence and military buildup is not limited to its western flank. Its
military activities in the East---for example, in the Kamchatka
Peninsula and the Kuril Islands---have understandably alarmed Japan, a
key U.S. ally in the Pacific.3 Indeed, in 2014, Russia's military
seizure of the Crimean Peninsula and military forces in eastern Ukraine
prompted a phone call between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo [Abe
and]{.underline} U.S. President [Obama]{.underline}. According to
reports, the two leaders [agreed]{.underline} that [Russia's actions
were "a threat to international peace and security."]{.underline}4

#### Scenario 2 is China: 

#### China is using its newfound Arctic presence to project global power and challenge the US 

**Garamone, 2024** (Jim Garamone, DOD News Reporter, Dod News,

The Arctic strategic environment is changing profoundly, and the United
States must pay greater attention and dedicate more resources to this
crucial area, said Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Arctic and Global Resilience. 

**[Ferguson addressed the increased attention that]{.underline}** the
People\'s Republic of **[China has in the Arctic]{.underline}**. She
spoke at the Center for Strategic and International Studies today. 

China is, by no means, an Arctic nation. But **[Chinese leaders see the
region as a new crossroads of the world, a new source of raw materials
and new avenues for manifesting its growing power.]{.underline}**

China is working closely with Russia in its attempt to be seen as an
Arctic power, Ferguson said. Even with Russia\'s unjust war on Ukraine,
President Vladimir Putin is investing heavily on military and economic
strategies in the Arctic. \"We\'re seeing Russia continue to have
immense focus on the Arctic region, and it\'s part of their ... security
calculus, vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\" Ferguson said. \"Despite the
attrition in Ukraine, we still see them \... heavily focused on the
region.\"

A shifting climate is speeding the pace of change in the region.
\"Climate change is still a factor in the region, where the region warms
at some four times the rate of the rest of the world,\" she said. This
means more access for settlements in the high North and more chances for
what she calls \"competitor activity.\"

**[\"\[China\] is one of the newer entrants on the
scene]{.underline}**,\" Ferguson said. \"Over time, **[the strategic
interests that they have in the region are ... giving us pause. How
their long-term vision for the region could affect our interests, is
\[also\] giving us pause]{.underline}**.\"

Even more disturbing is the increasing levels of collaboration between
Russia and China especially in the military domain, she said. Russia and
China exercised together in the Bering Strait in summer of 2023. \"Just
this past summer, right after we released our department
\[Arctic\] strategy, we saw a joint bomber patrol off of the coast of
Alaska.\"  

There has also been increasing cooperation between the Chinese and
Russian coast guards in the region. \"This kind of increasing levels of
military cooperation is new,\" she said. \"Certainly, it\'s new within
and around Alaska.\" 

The new DOD Arctic strategy is aimed at preserving the region as a place
that is both stable and secure, Ferguson said. She also discussed the
Defense Department\'s three main lines of effort in the region. The
first is enhancing domain awareness to see and detect threats, and to
ensure U.S. forces can operate in the region effectively.  

\"We\'re also really focused on engaging with our allies and partners,\"
she said. These nations are a unique U.S. strategic advantage that
stretches from the border of European Russia to the Bering Strait. These
are \"seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily capable
and also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said.  

Finally, the United States is working on using military exercises in the
region. \"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but
we\'re really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect,
working alongside our allies and partners,\" she said.  

There\'s an evolution in how competitors think about the region,
Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to continue on the DOD side to monitor
military activity.\" 

But this attention cannot be just limited to that. **[The Chinese are
using other aspects of their national power to insinuate themselves into
the region. China is involved in scientific and research projects in the
region. China is looking to establish economic ties within the Arctic.
\"We really just need to be clear-eyed about some of their intentions
and, how we can be like thinking about their long-term interests and,
how we can best protect ours]{.underline}**,\" Ferguson said.

Using the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month,
Chinese Minister of National Defense and State Councilor Gen. Wei
Fenghe, delivered a sharp message to the United States, which may be
termed the "Xi Doctrine" on China's use of force, after Chinese premier
Xi Jinping. Wei [declaring both China's resolve to **aggress to advance
its interests** and a **rationalization for the use of
force**]{.underline}. [Wei's]{.underline} de facto [threat of war should
not be lost in]{.underline} his nuances, deliberate
[ambiguity]{.underline}, or in translation. His remarks were so
bellicose that the world has noticed, as was certainly intended by the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). [Empirical evidence of
China's aggression is increasingly **common**]{.underline}, from its
attempt to dominate the South China Sea, the neo-imperialist effort to
gain control of states through the Belt and Road Initiative, to its
technological imperialism to control 5G and artificial intelligence
technologies. [What is]{.underline} rather [less frequent
are]{.underline} [statements]{.underline} from high-level [Chinese
officials]{.underline} [proclaiming the country's **intent to be
aggressive**]{.underline} [and offering an attempted **legitimizing
principle** justifying that aggression.]{.underline} While much of the
content of Wei's remarks were in keeping with the gossamer
pronouncements on China's peaceful intentions, as well as a paean to Xi
Jinping's leadership, they still conveyed that [China is ready and
**willing to resort to war**]{.underline} [if the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [stands in its **way of global
expansion**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} [they made
clear]{.underline} [that China must go to war]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} **[even a nuclear war]{.underline}**, **[to occupy
Taiwan.]{.underline}** Specifically, there are four elements that
comprise the Xi Doctrine and are indications of China's signaling its
willingness to use force. The first component is a new and alarming
proclamation of the undisguised threats to use force or wage an
unlimited war. China is becoming bolder as its military power grows.
This is evidenced in Wei's muscular remarks on the People's Republic of
China's approach against Taiwan, his explicit statement that China does
not renounce the use of force against Taiwan, and his effort to deter
the United States and its allies from intervention should an attack
occur. Wei forcefully stated: "If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from
China, the Chinese military has no choice but must go to war, and must
fight for the reunification of the motherland at all costs." "At all
cost" means that China will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons or
launching another Pearl Harbor to take over Taiwan. This is a clear
warning of an invasion. Second, [the Xi Doctrine]{.underline}
**[legitimizes territorial expansion]{.underline}**. Through his
remarks, Wei sought to convince the rest of the world that [China's
seizure of]{.underline} most of [the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [is an]{.underline} [accomplished
fact that cannot be overturned]{.underline}. He made bogus accusations,
which included blaming the United States for "raking in profits by
stirring up troubles" in the region. He insisted that only ASEAN and
China must resolve the issue. He claimed that China's militarization on
South China Sea islands and reefs were an act of self-defense. Should
this be allowed to stand, then the [Xi]{.underline} Doctrine [will set
a]{.underline} perilous [precedent of successful
territorial]{.underline} [expansion]{.underline}, [which
will]{.underline} [**further entice China** and jeopardize the **peace**
of the region]{.underline}. Third, [the doctrine targets the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a cause of the world's
major problems and]{.underline} [envisions a powerful China]{.underline}
[**evicting the United States** from the region]{.underline}. Wei
obliquely identified the United States as the cause wars, conflicts, and
unrest, and sought to convey that the United States will abandon the
states of the South China Sea (SCS) when it is confronted by Chinese
power, a typical divide and conquer strategy used by the CCP regime. The
Xi Doctrine's fourth element is the mendacity regarding China's
historical use of force and current actions. While the distortions of
history were numerous, there were three major lies that should be
alarming for the states of the region and the global community. First,
Wei said that China had never invaded another country, which is a claim
so transparently false it can only be a measure of the contempt he held
for the audience. China has a long history of aggression, including
against the Tibetans and Vietnamese, and perhaps soon against the
Taiwanese. Second, Wei argued that hegemony does not conform to China's
values when, in fact, China proudly was Asia's hegemon for most of the
last two thousand years. Lastly, he claimed that the situation in the
SCS is moving toward stability---from China's perspective this stability
is caused by its successful seizure of territory. In fact, the SCS is
far less stable as a result of China's actions. Efforts to counter this
grab are denounced by Wei as destabilizing, which is a bit like a thief
accusing you of a crime for wanting your property returned. Wei's
belligerent rhetoric is an indication that the CCP regime faces deep
external and internal crises. Externally, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [has]{.underline} [shocked the CCP with]{.underline} the
[three major steps]{.underline} it has taken. First, [it has shifted the
focus of the U.S. national-security strategy]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} now [identifies]{.underline} [China explicitly as its
primary rival]{.underline}---abandoning the far more muted policies of
previous administrations. Second, [Trump has]{.underline} acted on this
peer competitive threat by [advancing tangible measures, such as arms
sales to allies]{.underline} and the ban of Huawei. [Third, the
administration has]{.underline} [made **credible
commitments**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [assure]{.underline}
partners and [allies to **counter China's aggression**]{.underline} and
bullying. These have unbalanced the CCP regime, and its natural reaction
is to bully its way out. Additionally, the CCP regime has perceived that
the world today has begun to consider the negative implications of
China's rise, and the United States is determined to prevent what
heretofore had been considered China's unstoppable rise. From the
perspective of CCP, conflict is increasingly seen as inevitable and
perhaps even imminent. Wei's bellicosity should be seen in this light,
and the PLA is tasked with fighting and winning the war. Internally,
Xi's anti-corruption campaign that selectively targets his political
rivalries, and his abandoning the established rules such as term limited
of presidency, have introduced deep cleavages into the unity of the
regime unity. China's economic slowdown, made worse by the U.S. trade
war, is a fundamental challenge to the regime's legitimacy. Xi's
repression and suppression of the Chinese people, particularly
human-rights defenders, Christians, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other
minorities, have miscarried. Drawing from the pages of unfortunate
history, in a classic social-imperialist move, the regime wants to
direct these internal tensions outward. At the same time, [the
nationalistic fervor]{.underline} advanced by the CCP's propaganda
[and]{.underline} by the [rapid military modernization have made many
young militant officers in the PLA overconfident]{.underline}. This is
infrequently noticed in the West. [They can hardly wait to **fight an

## AD 2: Climate

#### Space based climate modelling has been eliminated from NASA's future funding

Politico, \"The domino effect of Trump's NASA climate cuts\", POLITICO,

DoA 6/10/2025, DVOG)

President Donald **[Trump wants to decimate NASA's climate
research]{.underline}** capacity. That could ultimately disrupt multiple
sectors of the economy, writes Scott Waldman.

In the White House budget documents released last week, **[Trump
proposed slashing a quarter of NASA's funding, specifically targeting
the agency's research on climate change. But many of NASA's instruments
that track human-caused climate change provide other critical
data]{.underline}**.

The agriculture industry, for example, relies on satellites and
instruments that not only track climate change but also keep tabs on
shifts in climatic zones that affect plant growth. Trump wants to
eliminate funding that keeps those tools operational.

**[Trump has proposed axing NASA's Surface Geology and Biology mission,
which monitors methane and carbon pollution but also hunts for and
identifies deposits of critical minerals. Also endangered is NASA's
Landsat satellite program]{.underline}**, which provides key data on
water levels and distribution as well as the ways global warming is
altering Earth.

"Whether you believe in climate change or human-induced impacts on
climate or not, these are atmospheric gases that have an impact on the
composition of the Earth," Richard Eckman, a veteran of NASA's Earth
Science Division, told Scott.

"It's very depressing to me to think that we're writing off the future
of NASA Earth Observing missions from space," he said.

Eckman also questioned the proposal to cut fully functioning satellites
already in orbit. Such probes typically cost billions of dollars to
build but comparatively little money to maintain once they've launched.

#### US space assets are critical to accurate climate modelling---starts in the Arctic and spills over. 

**Pope, 2024** (Kristin, Arctic Focus Analyst, Arctic Focus, \"Unlocking
Arctic Climate Secrets from Space\",
<https://www.arcticfocus.org/stories/unlocking-arctic-climate-secrets-space/>,
DoA 6/10/2025, DVOG)

**[Two shoebox-sized satellites,]{.underline}** each weighing less than
six pounds, **[are orbiting Earth]{.underline}**, flying high above
places like the Greenland Ice Sheet **[to collect valuable data about
the Arctic]{.underline}** and Antarctic. Their unique vantage point and
ability to collect global data over the course of almost a year **[will
provide scientists with information about our changing climate that will
help inform and improve climate modeling.]{.underline}**

The two CubeSats were launched into space in late May and early June on
Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, which lifted off from New Zealand. Over
the next year, **[these two tiny satellites will collect data to help
improve climate modeling, which is]{.underline}** **[especially
important in the Arctic since the region is warming almost four times as
fast as the rest of the planet]{.underline}**.

When people hear NASA and space programs, many think of astronauts on
the International Space Station, or sending rovers out to Mars, or even
searching for extraterrestrial life and exploring galaxies far away. But
NASA also frequently turns the scientific lens on Earth, with an array
of projects to learn about climate change using satellites, instruments
onboard the International Space Station, airplanes, and even ships,
balloons, and other research platforms.

The PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment)
mission will help scientists learn about heat exchange in polar regions,
collecting data about how much heat Earth absorbs and emits. The
difference between heat energy being absorbed and emitted shapes
climate, and **[this mission will unlock the secrets of climate in the
Arctic and fill knowledge gaps about Earth's energy budget since much of
this thermal infrared radiation has not been systematically measured
before]{.underline}**.

Earth's tropical regions absorb heat from the Sun, and then this solar
energy is transferred to the polar regions by weather and ocean
currents. Once it reaches the poles, some of this heat is emitted back
into space. Many factors influence these processes and how much heat is
emitted at the poles, including water vapor in the atmosphere, as well
as clouds and their characteristics. Much of the heat being radiated
back into space is in far-infrared wavelengths, which can be difficult
to measure, and this project will help fill knowledge gaps.

"**[It's very difficult to go and make measurements in either polar
region]{.underline}**," says PREFIRE principal investigator Tristan
L'Ecuyer, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While
weather stations and ship and aircraft-based projects have collected
measurements in many locations, L'Ecuyer says, "**[There's really no way
of measuring the entire Arctic]{.underline}** or Antarctic \[from
Earth\]... It's really impossible to make measurements that span the
entire polar regions **[without doing it from space]{.underline}**." He
also emphasizes the importance of collecting year-round measurements to
learn more about seasonal variations in energy fluxes.

PREFIRE will obtain measurements throughout the year so scientists can
learn more about how much heat the Arctic and Antarctic regions emit
into space, as well as how that influences the poles, and how those
factors vary seasonally. The data they collect will be used to fine-tune
and improve climate and ice modeling, and to inform models that simulate
processes like ice sheet melt rates. This will provide us with better
ideas of what to expect regarding climate and weather in the coming
years, from ice melt rates to sea level rise. Project partners include
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
and Blue Canyon Technologies, which constructed the CubeSats.

Having two CubeSats collecting provides not only redundancy in case one
were to malfunction or acquire damage, but it also provides more data
which scientists will use to learn more. The two satellites will have
asynchronous near-polar orbits, collecting data about polar regions once
every few hours. By collecting data so frequently, they can help track
short-lived phenomena like cloud cover and changes in moisture that
impact the heat energy they are studying.

"It is very important to us to be able to fly over and measure the same
location," L'Ecuyer says. Being able to make repeat measurements in a
single day at a location like the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet
provides data on short-term changes, like surface melting, cloud
formation, and water vapor changes--things that happen on a timescale of
hours rather than days. "\[Having\] two CubeSats that repeatedly make
measurements in the same location, but several hours apart, will let us
figure out not only what the heat flux at the top of the atmosphere is,
but how it gets impacted by changes in the ice surface or in terms of
what's going on in the atmosphere."

After launch, a commissioning period will allow scientists and engineers
to ensure the instruments are working correctly. They will check to make
sure it is oriented the correct direction, radio communications systems
are working correctly, and then collect some preliminary information,
such as photon counts, to make sure everything is working as it should.
Once everything is confirmed to be in good order, the 10-month data
collection period will begin.

PREFIRE isn't NASA's only project focusing on the Arctic this year. This
summer, NASA's ARCSIX (Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface
Interaction Experiment) will fly over the Arctic and study sea ice,
collecting measurements.

One challenge of Arctic data collection is the brightness of clouds, ice
sheets, and sea ice, which older data collection methods can sometimes
struggle to differentiate between. But PREFIRE is measuring infrared
wavelengths to collect measurements of cloud particle size and learn if
the cloud is liquid or ice, learning about the size and phase of the
particles. These factors determine if the clouds warm or cool the
surface.

These projects illustrate NASA's key role in climate change research,
with its first observations of Earth dating back to 1960 when the
initial TIROS weather satellite was launched. Then in the 1980s, NASA
set out to develop an Earth-observing system to learn more about the
"global change." By 2007, NASA had 17 space missions that were
collecting data about climate, from aerosols and ozone in the
atmosphere, to data on ice sheets and sea level rise.

While some projects involve planes or measurements taken near the Earth,
**[space provides an excellent vantage point to get a good view of
what's happening on Earth, particularly the poles.]{.underline}**

"In the polar regions, it's very difficult to measure things from the
ground," L'Ecuyer says. "And even when we've had aircraft, it's actually
very difficult to fly aircraft---there are not a lot of airports In the
Arctic."

That's where NASA comes in with its unique vantage point.

"NASA actually does a lot of work to try to improve our understanding of
climate," L'Ecuyer says. "NASA is able to measure things around the
entire globe. It's really the only way that we get information from all
the very remote areas of the globe."

#### Eliminating climate modelling devastates the agricultural industry 

**Waldman, 6/4/2025** (Scott Waldman, 6-4-2025, Politico Analyst \"Trump
budget would trigger 'extinction-level event' for NASA\", E&E News by
POLITICO,
<https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-budget-would-trigger-extinction-level-event-for-nasa/>,
DoA 6/10/2025, DVOG)

**[The White House proposal also would target entire satellite programs
for elimination]{.underline}** and dramatically curtail U.S. cooperation
with foreign science agencies. The number of NASA employees would be cut
by about a third, from more than 18,000 down to fewer than 12,000.

NASA's science division would bear the brunt of the blow. Its budget
would be cut from \$7.3 billion to \$3.9 billion, with major cuts to
programs that monitor and process the ways human-caused global warming
is transforming America and the world.

The proposal is an "extinction-level event" for one of the world's
leading science agencies, said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at
the Planetary Society, which advocates for research and exploration in
space.

"It's unprecedented, it's a fundamentally different science program than
what we've had for the last few decades, and one that I frankly think is
a narrower and less ambitious representation of our national goals," he
said, "And frankly, it abandons a lot of our joint efforts with our key
allies in the process."

Dreier added that **[cutting climate-related monitoring of the planet
will have immediate and negative effects on]{.underline}** a broad range
of industries, especially **[agriculture.]{.underline}**

The cuts will hit communities across the country too, as NASA's science
division funds work in every state as well as roughly 80 percent of the
nation's congressional districts, according to the Planetary Society.

Some parts of the proposal would save a relatively small amount of money
at the cost of impairing U.S. efforts to understand the way global
warming is changing the planet, critics say. The White House proposal
would cut off invaluable streams of data that have been collected during
Democratic and Republican administrations.

The satellite division would be hard hit too, and those cuts appear
aimed at any instrument that tracks human-caused climate change --- even
though they provide other useful data as well.

For instance, **[the Surface Geology and Biology mission --- slated for
elimination --- keeps tabs on methane and carbon pollution but also uses
sophisticated instruments to hunt for critical minerals.]{.underline}**

Also on the chopping block: the next generation of the LandSat satellite
program. **[LandSat tracks the ways global warming is altering Earth,
but it also provides data on water levels and
distribution.]{.underline}**

Trump has not staffed the National Space Council, which provides
guidance to the White House and federal agencies as well as the U.S.
Space Force --- though he may do so soon. It's not clear if the budget
is largely the product of the White House Office of Management and
Budget or if it was crafted with input from NASA.

White House and NASA officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Most years, White House budget plans are treated as either a rough draft
or a messaging document --- as the presidential proposals are often
dramatically altered by congressional appropriators.

But this year could be different, as congressional Republicans have
shown little willingness to break with the White House at the start of
President Donald Trump's second term.

Even if Republicans do attempt to undo some part of the White House plan
for NASA, OMB Director Russ Vought has said his office may simply ignore
congressional action and impound funds it does want to spend, which
likely would draw a legal challenge.

The proposed NASA cuts come at turbulent time for the space agency.

The Trump administration recently withdrew its first pick for NASA
administrator. That's because White House officials were angry that
Jared Isaacman --- an ally of Elon Musk --- had donated to some
Democrats including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut,
according to reporting from *The New York Times*.

Trump criticized Isaacman for his "prior associations."

On Tuesday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said a new nominee
for NASA chief would be named soon.

"The president wants to ensure that all of his nominees are aligned
fully with the America first mission of this administration," she said.

Trump has long dismissed climate science, but during his first term NASA
maintained a relatively robust research portfolio into the ways humanity
is altering the planet by burning fossil fuels.

But his latest budget proposal takes a sledgehammer to climate research,
observers say.

It's also unprecedented to cut fully functioning satellites in orbit
that are producing invaluable data, said Richard Eckman, who retired as
a program manager for NASA's Earth Science Division in January after
almost 40 years at the agency.

The probes typically cost billions of dollars to build and launch and
comparatively little to maintain once they're in space.

Eckman worked on Sage, one of the instruments slated for elimination,
which is bolted to the International Space Station and measures ozone as
required under the Clean Air Act of 1990.

He said it's clear the White House budget aims to blind the country to
the ways climate change is transforming the world.

But he said **[the satellites and instruments slated for elimination
produce all kinds of other data too, such as tracking the movement of
different climatic zones that affect plant growth and are relied upon by
the agriculture industry]{.underline}**.

The missions being canceled typically take decades to go from an idea to
an instrument launched into space, he said.

"Whether you believe in climate change or human-induced impacts on
climate or not, these are atmospheric gasses that have an impact on the
composition of the earth," he said. "It's very depressing to me to think
that we're writing off the future of NASA Earth Observing missions from
space."

Local fields, global consequences

Various agricultural technologies have caused corn and soybean harvests
to increase over the past three decades. On Jones's farm, for example,
yields have risen roughly 10 percent in 10 years. Jones plants cover
crops, which help trap carbon and keep moisture in the soil, but even
so, he expects future harvests to be smaller when summers are as hot as
they were this year.

And [**what happens** in the **Midwest doesn't always stay** in the
**Midwest**]{.underline}. [Ag]{.underline}riculture covers [127 million
acres](https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/midwest/topic/agriculture-midwest#:~:text=FACT%3A%20There%20are%20over%20127,%2C%20oats%2C%20onions%2C%20peaches%2C) of
[the region]{.underline}, with corn and soybeans growing on 75 percent
of them. [[Those fields
supply](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00646-4) more than
**33 percent** of the world's **corn** and 34 percent of the world's
**soybeans**]{.underline}, most of which are processed into meal for
livestock. [A **heat wave here**]{.underline} can [contribute to **food
shortages** in **the global marketplace**]{.underline}, [and add
to]{.underline} other climate-driven **[supply issues]{.underline}**
that may be [happening elsewhere]{.underline}. **[Extreme
weather]{.underline}** is [affecting
agriculture](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/) across the
globe, with corn yields, for example, [expected to
decrease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00400-y) by more
than 20 percent by 2070. Livestock is also likely to suffer, as it did
in Kansas this past June when 2,000 cattle died in temperatures that
topped 100 degrees. (Some farmers put up shelters to provide shade for
their animals and changed the bedding in the pens to keep the ground
from getting so hot.)

[Learning]{.underline} ways [to adapt to **extreme heat** is
**critically important** to the **global food supply**]{.underline} and
the health of farmworkers. [And you **don't have to look far** to see
the interconnections between climate, **food scarcity**, and **political
stability**]{.underline}. For instance, "the **[Arab
Spring]{.underline}** [was]{.underline} [**tightly related** to food
shortages in North Africa and the Middle East]{.underline}," says Long.
The pro-democracy upheavals were sparked a little more than a decade
ago, in part, by weather extremes---from floods in Australia to yellow
dust storms in the Middle East---that destroyed crops and caused food
shortages. With wheat prices surging, bread, a regional staple, became
prohibitively expensive.

[There's **no reason** to think future heat waves in **grain-producing
areas**]{.underline} of the world [wouldn't aggravate]{.underline} other
**[social weak points]{.underline}** or [create]{.underline} **[new

[Humans have **fought over food**]{.underline} [and the means of
producing it for **20,000 years**]{.underline}, [as rock art in
Australia shows]{.underline}. [Food]{.underline}, water [and land
scarcity]{.underline} [are **primary drivers**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} two thirds of [modern conflicts]{.underline} today.
Indeed, [many people seem to have forgotten that the primary German war
aim in **World War II** was to take **farmland** from the Soviets and
put German farmers on it.]{.underline} It is very likely that
[controlling the Ukraine's bountiful and reliable food bowl is among
**Putin's** main aims]{.underline} also. In the short run this is
imposing hunger and even starvation on hundreds of millions of people
far beyond Europe. 

**[Spreading hunger]{.underline}** [in turn **snowballs** into
**government failures**]{.underline}, **[civil wars]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[refugee tsunamis]{.underline}** [around the
world]{.underline} -- as it did in 2008 when a shortfall in Ukrainian
grain exports led to revolutions in three Arab countries. Already, a
third of a billion people -- equal to the entire population of Europe --
leave their homes each year, either as refugees or economic migrants, to
seek better lives in countries which seem more stable and food secure.
War will add to the flood.

Thus, in developing a new food system for the world of the 21st Century,
we also have to find a way to curb the human appetite for war.

In [Food or
War](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/environmental-policy-economics-and-law/food-or-war?format=PB),
I trace the links between food and conflict through human history,

of the world]{.underline} which [are at **high risk** of **food
failure**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[conflict]{.underline}** [in
the foreseeable future]{.underline} -- [conflicts ranging from riots and
government failure to **nuclear war**]{.underline}. My aim is to show
that [the link between food and war is **inexorable**]{.underline} --
but that it can be broken. And that [having enough good food is the most
under-rated, under-recognised and precious 'weapon of peace' in the
world today]{.underline}.

#### Independently, REM mining in the Arctic will become the new normal 

**Murkins, 2022** (Sydney Murkins, United States Marine and Foreign Area
Officer, 3-21-2022, \"The Future Battlefield is Melting: An Argument for
Why the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy\", Arctic

DoA 6/6/2025, DVOG)

**[Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region
among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations,]{.underline}** such as China.
Melting sea ice from rising global temperatures has created new military
and economic opportunities in the region. Since 1979, the Arctic has
warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, according to an
August 2022 scientific study published in *Nature*.^3)^ **[As ice
rapidly melts in the Arctic, increased access to critical rare earth
elements, such as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel
emerge]{.underline}**. Moreover, melting ice is opening more easily
traversed Arctic waters, which has led to a surge of both military and
commercial ship activity in the region. These two developments have
increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.

**[Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the
materials will have a strategic advantage. These minerals are required
for developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense.]{.underline}** According to the
World Bank, **[the demand to produce minerals, many of which are found
in the Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to meet the
growing demand for clean energy technologies.]{.underline}**^4)^ China
already dominates the global supply chain for critical materials. The
United States depends on these materials for its economic
competitiveness and national defense.^5)^

As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more navigable. This has
resulted in more ship activity in the region. For instance, the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
reports that there has been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and
distance sailed in the Arctic over the past ten years.^6)^ While much of
this activity is commercial, Russia and China have also taken advantage
of the new sea routes to project their naval power. They have carried
out numerous regional deployments and patrols, demonstrating their
ability to execute military operations in the austere Arctic
climate.^7)^ The expanded presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the
region poses a growing threat to NATO member states. In October 2023,
Finnish investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of
dragging its anchor over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom
cables and one pipeline. While the international community has not
assigned blame wholly to China, China later admitted to accidentally
destroying an important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in
the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples suggest that incidents of this
nature could become more likely as military activity increases in the
region.

#### Space based technology is necessary to discover and safely mine REMs

**Asadzadeh, Koellner, & Chabrillat, 2024** (Saied, Nicole, and Sabine,
Researchers in Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics, Helmholtz Centre
Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, 9-4-2024,

data: a case study from Mountain Pass, California\", Nature,
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71395-2>, DoA 6/10/2025,
DVOG)

This study demonstrated that EnMAP hyperspectral **[satellite data can
directly and efficiently detect REEs in geological
environments]{.underline}**. EnMAP successfully resolved the distinctive
absorption features of Nd at 740 and 800 nm arising from the Nd-rich
bastnaesite ore in the Mountain Pass area. While EnMAP could resolve the
feature at ∼580 nm, the feature was not suitable for REE mapping due to
its low intensity and interference with iron oxides and the chlorophyll
absorption feature occurring at ∼590 nm. EnMAP data was unable to
confidently resolve the feature at ∼870 nm. **[The absorption feature
analysis and polynomial fitting technique proved to be a superior and
effective processing method for characterizing the prominent REE
absorption features and mapping the occurrences and relative abundances
of Nd]{.underline}** in imaging spectroscopic data.

**[Detecting the spectral signature of REEs by spaceborne imaging
spectroscopic data can take exploration activities for REEs to another
level.]{.underline}** Conventionally, carbonatite bodies, as the primary
hosts of LREEs, have been explored through geophysical methods relying
on airborne magnetic and radiometric
surveys[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71395-2#ref-CR41).
**[Introducing a remote sensing approach capable of detecting the
contained REEs directly and mapping the underlying host mineralogy and
alteration aureoles]{.underline}** can complement the existing
exploration portfolio, **[facilitating the discovery of new carbonatite
bodies and REEs resources.]{.underline}**

The EnMAP satellite data with its global coverage can be used to screen
large areas for REE signatures. However, given its 30 m spatial
resolution, it is expected to mainly detect well-exposed targets of
sufficient Nd quantities/sizes in arid to semi-arid regions of the
world. Advancements in atmospheric correction procedures and processing
methods can aid in detecting lower grades and smaller Nd-bearing
targets. Because REEs are often associated with each other, and because
the host mineralogy does not highly modify the REE-related absorption
features, remote sensing mapping of Nd should serve as an exploration
pathfinder for light (and potentially heavy) REEs, irrespective of their
deposit types.

#### Arctic REM mining is key to the renewable technology that will solve warming

**Evans, 2025** (Scarlett, NRI Analyst, January 23, 2025 Mining in the
Arctic: a rare earth 'cold rush'?\", Mine-NRI Digital,
<https://mine.nridigital.com/mine_feb25/arctic-mining-rare-earths>, DoA
6/10/2025, DVOG)

In its 2024 Economic Report, **[the Arctic Economic
Council]{.underline}** (AEC) **[highlighted the potentially pivotal role
mining in Arctic nations could play in fueling the world's increasing
demand for critical raw materials.]{.underline}**

It stated that **[the Arctic]{.underline}** region, which encompasses
parts of eight separate countries, **[is home to 31 of the 34 materials
identified as essential for clean energy technology.]{.underline}**

Of note within these are rare earth elements (REEs), materials necessary
for a range of clean energy technologies including electric vehicles
(EVs), batteries and wind turbines. REEs in particular are being eyed up
in Norway, Sweden and Greenland.

Mining is not new to the Arctic region. Alaska is home to the largest
zinc mine in the world and Sweden to the largest iron ore mine in
Europe. However, high wages and strict regulatory frameworks have been
something of a deterrent to mining companies' activity in the region as
they typically want to extract as much as possible with minimal
overheads.

Short daylight hours and extreme cold have also proven to be a hurdle to
investors looking to build infrastructure in the Arctic, as well as
companies that must provide high wages to attract any kind of workforce.
The result is that the region's mineral potential has remained
relatively untapped despite its resources -- something the AEC, among
others, is looking to change.

**[With projections that critical minerals needs, including those for
REEs, are set to rise exponentially, coupled with mounting fears of an
overreliance on rare earth superpower China, a renewed spotlight is
being put on the Arctic as a potential mining hotspot]{.underline}**.

The minerals appeal of the Arctic

"The Arctic region has three things that have always (and will always)
be exported," says Mads Qvist Frederiksen, executive director at AEC.
"Fish, energy and raw materials --- with the latter going back to the
1600s.

"Fast forward, and with the rise of industrialisation the world needs
more and more minerals as it needs more technologies, meaning the
Arctic\'s raw materials are getting renewed attention."

Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency, **[demand for
critical minerals will nearly triple by 2030, growing to more than
3.5-times the current levels by 2050]{.underline}**. This, alongside the
fact that the Arctic is feeling the effects of climate change more
keenly than anywhere else -- warming four-times faster than the rest of
the world, according to research in Nature -- has given some urgency to
the Arctic focus.

**[Currently, no REEs are mined in Europe]{.underline}**, although the
landscape is shifting, and exploration of the Arctic has already proven
it is home to significant deposits of the materials.

According to the Arctic Review, Greenland has enough reserves of
minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium to meet at least a quarter of
future global demand, around 38.5 million tonnes (mt).

Additionally, in 2023, Swedish miner LKAB made headlines by announcing
it had identified a REE deposit in Kiruna that exceeds 1mt of rare earth
oxides. The discovery was, briefly, the largest deposit of its kind in
Europe, before being overtaken in 2024 by Norway's Fen Carbonatite
Complex in Telemark.

While LKAB is still conducting research into the Kiruna deposit, the
discovery adds to the perception of the Nordic Arctic as a viable supply
alternative to China -- evidenced by Donald Trump's renewed mission to
gain control of Greenland's minerals.

"The two main drivers for people looking to the region are climate
change and geopolitics," explains Frederiksen. "Of course, **[we need
critical raw materials to pursue a green transition]{.underline}**, but
people are also looking for control, and with nations like China
stockpiling materials including rare earths, people are becoming
concerned about resource control."

In this context, it seems mining in the Arctic region is raring to go;
however, there are several challenges that need to be overcome before
this can happen.

#### Warming causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--it [overwhelms]{.underline} adaptation, causes [power vacuums]{.underline}, and risks escalating [conflicts]{.underline}.

On the other side of the Atlantic, and more or less at the same time as
Wallace-Wells was getting attention too, David Bendell (2018) generated
controversy with a paper and subsequent edited book on what he called
deep adaptation (Bendell and Read 2021). When the paper was rejected by
a journal he self-published it online, arguing that contemporary
trajectories, especially melting permafrost and methane releases in the
Arctic, were happening much faster than conventional analyses were
suggesting. The acceleration of climate change suggested to Bendell that
**[conventional assumptions]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} climate
[adaptation]{.underline} were **[underestimat]{.underline}**ing [what
was coming and]{.underline} that [civilization was]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}** [to cope without]{.underline}
**[dramatic]{.underline}** social and economic [change]{.underline}.
These he saw as unlikely to transpire in a timely manner, hence
**[societal collapse looms]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[near]{.underline}** term **[future]{.underline}**. Some of these
arguments were influential with parts of the Extinction Rebellion
movement in Britain in particular.

One notable point in Bendell's argument is that his paper was rejected
on the grounds that it didn't engage the contemporary social science
literature. But, he argued, that was his point; conventional social
science assumes that the future will be more or less the same as the
present, hence it doesn't generate the kind of material that Bendell is
concerned about, a rapid climate transition that is outside what
conventional projections, and economic analyses in particular, are
assuming. Not surprisingly there wasn't much of a social science
literature for him to engage! While Bendell doesn't use Michael Albert's
(2020) formulation of social science as committed to "continuationism",
the argument is loosely consistent with the use of this term.
[Projections]{.underline} into the future [assume]{.underline} that
[social patterns change]{.underline} **[gradually]{.underline}**,
[not]{.underline} **[abruptly]{.underline}**.

The case of international relations as a discipline failing to
anticipate the demise of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s suggests
linearity and persistence as key assumptions in security studies. What
both Wallace-Wells and Bendell suggest is that current trajectories are
likely to lead to non-linear responses, both in terms of natural change
and in terms of social change. Gradual linear changes are what one
assumes if market mechanisms and technical innovation form the policy
framework for tackling climate change. [But]{.underline}, and this is a
key point, [it's mostly]{.underline} **[rapid severe]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[unexpected shocks]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[tipping points]{.underline}** [in natural]{.underline} and social
[systems]{.underline}, [that worry people]{.underline} thinking about
climate as a security problem.

[Failure to]{.underline} **[respond appropriately]{.underline}** and in
time to indications of likely future risks [may]{.underline} indeed
[lead to]{.underline} **[catastrophe]{.underline}**. In security studies
at least, histories of war suggest that militaries are usually preparing
to fight previous wars, or at least frequently find themselves ill
equipped for novel circumstances. This was the case most recently when
the United States fought the war on terror in the aftermath of 9/11
mostly with an organization and armaments which had been designed to
fight the Soviet Union decades earlier (Dalby 2009a). Likewise it seems
that the military now are ill equipped to deal with the challenges that
climate change and biodiversity decline present. As noted earlier,
Daniel Deudney (1990) pointed out at the beginning of the environmental
security discussion that given its training, missions and equipment, the
military is hardly the appropriate institution to tackle ecological
matters. Its equipment is frequently useful in responding to disasters,
but the huge use of fossil fuels involved in military transport,
frequently not counted in greenhouse gas emission calculations, is part
of the problem (Belcher, Bigger, Neimark and Kennelly 2020).
**[Prevention]{.underline}** [is key]{.underline}; **[drastic reactions
after the fact]{.underline}** [are an indication of]{.underline}
**[failure]{.underline}**. To paraphrase the key argument from classical
Chinese strategist Sun Tsu, if you have to fight your strategy has
failed. In the case of climate change this adage is directly applicable;
[avoiding]{.underline} **[catastrophic climate change]{.underline}** [is
the]{.underline} **[only security strategy]{.underline}** that is
feasible, [and a]{.underline} **[functional civilization]{.underline}**
[of many billion people in a]{.underline} **[radically
destabilized]{.underline}** [climate]{.underline} system
[is]{.underline} **[simply not possible]{.underline}**.

There is a very considerable social science literature engaging with the
dangers of environmental collapse and the lessons that might be learned
from historical cases of empires and societies disappearing as a result
of calamities, some of which they brought upon themselves. Jared
Diamond's (2005) volume Collapse is an especially high profile example.
What is new in the case of Wallace-Wells and Bendell is the projections
that climate change and radical disruptions caused by humanity will be
the likely cause of civilizational collapse in coming decades. While
much of the discussion about historical cases of societal collapse has
focused on naturally occurring climate change, or in many cases on the
exhaustion of agricultural resources by either ill-considered farming
and irrigation practices or natural limitations in particular
ecosystems, the current apocalyptic framing doesn't focus on resource
shortages or direct poisoning by pollution. The 1970s discussion of the
Limits to Growth too focused on resource shortages as a cause of the
collapse of industrial civilization (Herrington 2021). The formulation
of environmental security derived from Our Common Future likewise
suggests that resource shortages are a key problem. But now, with both
the extinction crisis and climate change, the discussion is focused on
the opposite argument: the consequences of too much economic growth
based on the dramatic expansion of firepower in the period of the great
acceleration.

In contrast [climate disasters are]{.underline} projected as
[the]{.underline} **[indirect]{.underline}** [result of disruptions
caused by]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline}, and the
response of such things as melting permafrost and the slowing of the
Gulf Stream, and, in Bendell's case, alarm about **[collapsing marine
methane]{.underline}** clathrates which [might cause a]{.underline}
**[huge spike]{.underline}** [in methane]{.underline} in the atmosphere
[with]{.underline} **[disastrous]{.underline}** rapid **[global
heating]{.underline}** as the outcome. At the worst [these]{.underline}
disruptions and the failure to deal with them [might]{.underline}, so
these narratives of doom suggest, [lead to]{.underline} the
**[elimination of humanity]{.underline}** in toto. Science fiction
writers have explored these scenarios too. John Barnes in Mother of
Storms offers a cautionary tale of rapid heating caused by military
action; Frank Schatzing's nightmare scenario in his novel The Swarm
focuses on other dangers from clathrates but cautions against military
attempts to destroy environmental threats. While both are excellent
entertainment, there is little in the scientific literature to suggest
that disintegrating ocean bed clathrates offer immediate threats of
destabilizing the earth system.

A [failure to]{.underline} anticipate such concerns with possible
dramatic destabilizations of the earth system in time, or instigate
actions to **[slow]{.underline}** [climate change and make
societies]{.underline} much **[more adaptable]{.underline}**, [might
lead to elites]{.underline} **[struggling]{.underline}** [to maintain
control]{.underline}, in the process [leading to]{.underline} **[major
wars]{.underline}**. [If they went]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**, [which given the number of]{.underline}
nuclear [arsenals]{.underline} currently [in existence is]{.underline}
**[quite possible]{.underline}**, then once again **[nuclear winter
raises its head]{.underline}** [as civilization's fate]{.underline}.
Glikson (2017) makes the argument that we might better term present
circumstances the Plutocene, because of the future persistence of
plutonium and the long lasting isotopes that it generates. In this
context the concerns raised by the delegates at the 1972 conference in
Stockholm about the need to eliminate nuclear weapons as part of any
serious attempt to grapple with global environmental issues seem
prescient, even if they were dropped from the sustainable development
discourse once the cold war ended.

**[Human extinction looms]{.underline}** over this discussion and has
led to more recent systematic discussions of this possibility, and a
larger scholarly engagement with the question of long term human
survival (Bostrom 2013). This now provides the largest scale
contextualization for security studies, and in terms of how
environmental security might be rethought, is an essential part of the
discussion for a discipline that has survival as its core concern. But
this isn't just a matter of human extinction: earth system trajectories
in motion suggest that [fossil fueled civilization is]{.underline}
already [causing the]{.underline} **[sixth]{.underline}** overall
**[extinction event]{.underline}** in the planet's history (Ceballos,
Ehrlich and Dirzo 2017). The potential for **[major biosphere
disruption]{.underline}** [because of]{.underline} **[ocean
acidification looms]{.underline}** over much of this discussion too.
This is now the key context for engaging with environmental security,
rather than the narrow focus on resource shortages as putative causes of
conflict in the Global South.

EXTINCTIONS, AND MERE CATASTROPHES

While there are some technical arguments about what counts as a global
extinction event and whether we are living in the sixth one at the
moment, conventional wisdom counts five major extinction events in the
geological record. As noted in Chapter 3, the most famous is the episode
ending the age of the dinosaurs, with a massive asteroid collision with
earth being a key part of this story. Reconstructing such episodes is
key to stratigraphy, the study of the layers of rocks that tell the
story of the planet in the history of sediments and volcanic episodes,
and paleontology, the study of fossil life that charts the rise and
demise of forms of life in the biosphere, the living part of the
planetary system. The major periods of earth history are designated in
terms of the dominant forms of life that lived in those times. Now the
dominant form is human, the Anthropos is us; hence we now live in the
Anthropocene.

The discussion of the Anthropocene highlights the simple but profound
fact that humanity is now causing geological scale transformations of
the earth, something that is not intuitively obvious to most people, and
something that is clearly well beyond the scope of many politicians to
grasp, and also beyond most efforts, at least so far, at global
governance. While climate change is mostly discussed in terms of more
extreme weather, potential violence and the costs of storms and floods,
that larger context is more fundamental once one considers the long term
fate of humanity. Hence the growing use of terms such as existential
crisis, even if it is frequently far from clear precisely whose
existence is threatened and hence what kind of security policy is needed
for whom where. The David Wallace-Wells (2017) article posed the
question of whether all of humanity might be eliminated by climate
change and the disruptions likely to follow from failures to anticipate
what might be coming and act in time to prevent calamity. His subsequent
book (Wallace-Wells 2019) may have been less apocalyptic in tone, but
the question hangs over the discussion of climate change, and work in
the field of environmental security simply has to confront it even if
conventional international relations analyses have been slow to engage
these larger questions.

Because one thing is clear: the **[prior climate history]{.underline}**
of the planet [demonstrates that]{.underline} **[popular]{.underline}**
journalistic and policy maker **[assumptions]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[gradual]{.underline}** climate
[changes]{.underline}, of slowly rising temperatures and weather
patterns shifting in predicable trajectories towards the poles,
[are]{.underline} **[unlikely]{.underline}** [to be correct]{.underline}
(Barnosky, Hadly, Bascompte et al. 2012). While clearly climate systems
will move, and where soils can accommodate plants from distant places,
agricultural opportunities may open up (Xu, Kohler amd Lenton 2020), the
newly ice free parts of Greenland being a case in point,
[assuming]{.underline} that these [transitions will be]{.underline}
either **[smooth]{.underline}** progressions [or]{.underline}
**[predictable]{.underline}** sequences [has]{.underline}
**[long]{.underline}** [been recognized as]{.underline} assuming **[too
much]{.underline}** (Alley 2004; Schneider 2004). These possibilities
are key to thinking about global security, a very different set of
assumptions than those that have long populated economic risk analyses
relating to climate, with linear projections far into the future (Keen
2021), and implicit assumptions of the inevitability of economic growth.

One **[particularly worrisome]{.underline}** scenario that has engaged
popular culture is the matter of [the]{.underline} dangers of the
**[Gulf Stream stopping]{.underline}**, or at least slowing noticeably
(Caesar, McCarthy, Thornally et al. 2021). [If]{.underline} substantial
[meltwater from Arctic ice changes the density of water]{.underline} in
the North Atlantic then [it]{.underline} **[will not sink]{.underline}**
as it has been doing since the end of the last glaciation.
[If]{.underline} this occurs, in technical terms [the]{.underline}
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (**[AMOC]{.underline}**)
[stops]{.underline}, [then the]{.underline} **[global
circulation]{.underline}** [of ocean currents would stop]{.underline},
[and this would have]{.underline} **[numerous ecological
effects]{.underline}**. Should that happen, then [European climates are
likely]{.underline} to be **[very substantially cooler]{.underline}** in
the short run (farmers in Greenland will have their hopes disappointed)
[and]{.underline} **[ag]{.underline}**riculture there [will
be]{.underline} **[disrupted]{.underline}**. (This too has been
presented in hugely exaggerated form in the 2004 Hollywood disaster
movie The Day After Tomorrow.) If the AMOC slows or stops it might
temporarily slow melting in Greenland, but presumably heating would
intensify further south as the warm waters no longer move heat to higher
latitudes. More than this, [the]{.underline} various **[crucial
parts]{.underline}** [of the earth]{.underline} system [that may
be]{.underline} **[destabilized]{.underline}** as the earth heats
[are]{.underline} **[not independent]{.underline}**, [and
if]{.underline} **[one]{.underline}** [crosses a]{.underline} **[tipping
point]{.underline}** and begins to operate differently, [others
may]{.underline} **[follow]{.underline}** (Wunderling, Donges, Kurths
and Winkelmann 2021). **[Cascade disruptions]{.underline}** [make
predicting these]{.underline} interactions **[difficult]{.underline}**,
and because there is lack of clarity in terms of what amount of heating
is required for tipping points to be crossed, predictions are difficult.
[But that]{.underline} **[doesn't]{.underline}** [mean]{.underline}
these [dangers]{.underline} **[aren't foreseeable]{.underline}**, [and
if]{.underline} **[rapid decarbonization]{.underline}** of the global
economy [is set]{.underline} in motion, [they might be
avoided]{.underline}.

The crucial point in all this is that **[regional
consequences]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[likely]{.underline}**
from global climate change, [and]{.underline} **[average]{.underline}**
[temperature changes over the]{.underline} **[whole system aren't
helpful]{.underline}** [as indications of how]{.underline} conditions in
[particular places are]{.underline} likely to be [affected]{.underline}.
All of which means that [risks]{.underline} to specific places, as with
specific economic systems, [need to be evaluated]{.underline} in much
more detail, [and in]{.underline} the case of **[supply
chains]{.underline}** in the global economy, [points of]{.underline}
**[vulnerability]{.underline}** [identified]{.underline}.
[Policies]{.underline} over the next few decades [need to]{.underline}
**[grapple]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the
[disruptions]{.underline}, extreme weather and heat waves that are
likely, rather than assume a smooth transition to a future stable state
(Albert 2020). [The]{.underline} **[key question]{.underline}** for
consideration specifically of security [is whether]{.underline} states,
societies and **[economies]{.underline}** with production systems,
[and]{.underline} crucially **[infrastructure]{.underline}** designed
for one set of circumstances, [will be]{.underline} **[flexible
enough]{.underline}** [to handle]{.underline} **[disruptive
transitions]{.underline}**.

[States also have a shared interest in cooperation as an antidote
against conflict, especially in remote and extreme environments where
military preparations and activities can be punishingly expensive. The
OSCE's 1992 Treaty on Open Skies enabled the verification of arms
control agreements. The Arctic Council was created, in large part, to
foster communication, build confidence, reduce tensions, and thus help
to prevent conflict in the post-Cold War period]{.underline} (English,
2013). The greatest accomplishment of the Arctic Search and Rescue
Agreement may have been to regularise contact, and therefore
confidence-building, among the militaries and coastguards of the eight
Arctic states (Exner-Pirot, 2012). The creation of the Arctic Coast
Guard Forum has carried this development further. In Space, one of the
motivations for the Cospas-Sarsat Programme was to continue the
cooperation and confidence-building that had developed---during the Cold
War---as a result of the Apollo--Soyuz Project (Jamgotch, Knappet, &
Carpio, 1988). In the 1990s, the same motivation led to Russia being
invited to participate in the ISS as a full partner, despite the United
States shouldering most of the cost. The recent inclusion of Russia as
the United States' primary partner in the Lunar Gateway is a
continuation of this policy---taking collaborative, confidencebuilding
steps that reduce tensions and thus help to prevent conflict. [From a
security perspective, the Arctic and Space have long been 'militarized'
but not substantially 'weaponized'.]{.underline} Militarisation is the
use of a region for the transportation of personnel and weapons as well
as the placement of supporting equipment, whereas weaponisation involves
the actual placement of weapons in the region (Sheehan, 2007). By
avoiding the weaponisation of a remote and environmentally extreme
region, states can avoid what might otherwise be punishingly high costs.
[Avoiding weaponisation will also facilitate international cooperation
and therefore the advancement of mutual interests within a region. And
one of the usual drivers for weaponisation---the so-called 'security
dilemma'---will be easier to avoid in the Arctic and Space because of
the relative ease with which the activities of other states can be
monitored there.]{.underline} The Arctic Ocean, located directly between
the United States and the Soviet Union, was a key staging point for
nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Long-range bombers circled over the
ocean, waiting for the signal to fly deep into the other country to drop
their nuclear bombs. Nuclear missile submarines conducted parallel
operations under the sea-ice, and radar systems and acoustic sensors
were built to surveil all this activity. But neither side was preparing
to fight a war in the Arctic; the region was an avenue for transporting
weapons to targets much further south, with the supporting
infrastructure limited to runways and surveillance equipment. The end of
the Cold War saw a steep decline in Russia's military spending, with the
country closing many of its Arctic airbases and allowing the Northern
Fleet to atrophy. [More recently, Russia sought to arrest the decline by
resuming bomber flights, building new submarines, and re-opening
airbases (BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union, 2018). But most of the
reinvestment in Arctic-specific equipment and
infrastructure]{.underline} has focused on search and rescue and
'constabulary' capabilities associated with increased civilian activity
such as shipping and oil drilling (Gurzu, 2016; Staalesen, 2016).
[Although Western commentators sometimes point to Russia's substantial
naval presence on the Kola Peninsula as evidence that the Arctic has
been weaponised, submarines and warships are not based on the Kola
Peninsula because it is in the Arctic. Rather, they are based there
because the Barents Sea is ice-free throughout the year, providing
assured access to the Atlantic Ocean.]{.underline} This access is
important for Russia because it has relatively little access to open
ocean, despite being the world's largest country. Except in Norway,
which shares a land border with Russia, [NATO countries have never
prepared for a war in the Arctic. Most armed forces are stationed in
more southern regions. Canada, for instance, has 68,000 full-time
military personnel, but only 200 of them are based in the northern
territories that make up 40 percent of its landmass]{.underline}
(Canadian Army, 2018; Kalvapalle, 2018). US bases in Alaska are focused
on the Russian Far East, North Korea, and China, not the Arctic Ocean.
[The United States does not have a single deep-water port along its
Arctic coastline. Space is heavily militarised, with thousands of
military satellites having been launched since the 1950s for
communications, surveillance, situational awareness, and
targeting]{.underline} (Sheehan, 2007). Modern militaries are dependent
on satellites, to the point where 'fifth generation' fighter jets and
armed drones cannot operate to their full capabilities without
space-based broadband (Thompson, Gagnon, & McLeod, 2018). GPS was
developed for military purposes and is a key component of
precision-guided missiles, bombs, and artillery. And while the
militarisation of Space slowed at the end of the Cold War, it
accelerated after President George W. Bush renounced the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated US missile defence. Today, roughly
half of the satellites in operation are military or dual-use satellites,
that is to say, satellites, such as GPS, which serve both military and
civilian purposes (Freeland, 2016). [To the degree that Space was ever
weaponised, this occurred due to the testing of anti-satellite (ASAT)
weapons during the Cold War. These weapons ranged from ground-based
missiles, lasers, and jammers to Space-based 'killer satellites'
designed to crash into other satellites, capture them, or nudge them off
course]{.underline} (Moltz, 2014). But it is unclear whether any ASAT
weapons are currently deployed in Space, and no such weapon has ever
been used against a satellite from another country. As will be discussed
below, [in 2007, a Chinese ASAT test produced tens of thousands of
pieces of Space debris, leading states to subsequently refrain from any
testing of 'kinetic' ASAT weapons]{.underline}, that is to say, weapons
which rely on violent impacts. They have done so because of widespread
concern about the risk of 'runaway' Space debris, whereby collisions
between two pieces of debris create thousands of smaller pieces,
followed by more collisions, and so on (Billings, 2015). [There are a
number of possible explanations for the militarized but-not-weaponised
character of the Arctic and Space.]{.underline} First, remoteness and
extreme conditions make it difficult and expensive to design, construct,
and deploy weapons for-and-in these regions. The same is true of the
training, equipping, and deploying of troops. The large exercises that
do take place are generally confined to the European and western Russian
Arctic, which benefit from ice-free waters and relatively warm
temperatures due to the effects of the Gulf Stream. Military exercises
in the North American Arctic, with its persistent sea-ice and punishing
climate, tend to be much smaller---because of the difficulty and expense
as well as the related absence of threats. In 2009, Canada's then-Chief
of the Defence Staff, General Walter Natynczyk, said: "If someone were
to invade the Canadian Arctic, my first task would be to rescue them"
(Deshayes, 2009). On another occasion, Natynczyk commented that it costs
more to deploy a Canadian soldier to the Canadian Arctic than to
Afghanistan (Canadian Press, 2011). Troops have never been deployed in
Space, nor is this likely to happen. Humans can only exist in Space
within complex and expensive life support systems, leaving remotely
operated (and now artificial intelligence) systems as much more
attractive options. Second, all of the Arctic states have undisputed
rights over vast landmasses and extensive maritime zones. Indeed, the
only disputed land in the Arctic is a 1.3 km2 islet located halfway
between Canada and Greenland, and the only two disputed maritime
boundaries are between NATO countries, namely Canada and the United
States, and Canada and Denmark (Byers, 2013). As a result, there is no
reason for any of the Arctic states to desire more of the Arctic, or to
have any interest in fighting over it. As for Space, technology has not
yet advanced to the point where states could benefit from claims to the
Moon, asteroids, or other celestial bodies; they therefore have no
interest in preparing for conflicts over them. And while Earth orbit is
relatively easy to reach, satellites are fragile pieces of equipment
that follow predictable trajectories; they are therefore much easier to
attack than to defend. [Moreover, it is widely accepted that runaway
Space debris---of the kind that would result from the use of kinetic
ASAT weapons---could cause severe damage to the global economy and
therefore to every state.]{.underline} Together, these factors create a
situation of mutually assured destruction with regard to communications
and remote-sensing satellites, were an armed conflict ever to break out
in Space. [Last but not least, it is relatively easy---especially with
modern Space-based technologies---to gather information about military
activities in the Arctic and Space, as compared to other regions,
because of the relative absence of other human activities as well as
trees, buildings, and other objects that might offer
concealment]{.underline}. [One example of this concerns how Arctic
countries have invested in synthetic aperture radar satellites which can
identify and track ships from Space, even at night and through
clouds]{.underline} (Canadian Space Agency, 2018; European Space Agency,
2012a, 2012b). [Another example concerns how amateur astronomers are
able to identify the presence and orbits of new military satellites,
notwithstanding the efforts of governments and launch providers to keep
this information secret]{.underline} (Nash, 2012). [This last factor
enables Arctic and Space-faring states to avoid the classic 'security
dilemma', whereby states feel compelled to build up their military
capabilities in an escalating series of responses to suspected increases
by others (Herz, 1950; Jervis, 1978; Booth &Wheeler, 2007).]{.underline}

**The affirmative recognizes the complex interdependence of both the
Arctic and space, which creates the conditions for cooperation**

I have argued elsewhere that [Russian--Western cooperation in the Arctic
continued]{.underline} after the 2014 annexation of [Crimea because of
the existence of 'complex interdependence' within the
region]{.underline} (Byers, 2017). A multiplicity of issues, actors,
transnational channels of contact, and associated interdependencies made
it possible for Russia and Western countries to treat their relations in
the Arctic separately from the tensions and breakdowns elsewhere. [This
article builds on that work by also examining Space, where
Russian--Western cooperation similarly continued after 2014--- most
obviously on the International Space Station but also with respect to
space debris, satellite-based search and rescue, and the sale of Russian
rocket engines and launch services to Western governments and
companies]{.underline}. This article finds that, [while complex
interdependence is an important factor in continued cooperation in both
the Arctic and Space]{.underline}, at least seven other factors also
contribute to the continuance of pre-2014 relations. [These include: the
Arctic and Space are both remote and extreme environments; the Arctic
and Space are militarised but not substantially weaponised; and the
Arctic and Space both suffer from 'tragedies of the commons'. Together,
these first three factors give rise to a response which is, itself, a
factor in continued cooperation: Arctic and Space-faring states engage
in risk management through international law-making. And this law-making
is facilitated by two further factors which likewise contribute to
cooperation: Arctic and Space relations rely on consensus
decision-making; and Arctic and Space relations rely on soft
law.]{.underline} A final contributing factor, at least to Russian--
American cooperation, is that both Russia and the United States are
resisting greater Chinese involvement in the Arctic and Space. [This
multiplicity of factors is entirely consistent with the existence of
complex interdependence, which Keohane and Nye have always insisted is a
'concept' rather than a 'theory']{.underline}. Indeed, [understanding a
highly complex situation often requires the use of multiple theoretical
lenses]{.underline}---in order to identify and assess multiple factors.
As Peter Katzenstein and Nobuo Okawara explained: [Strict formulations
of realism, liberalism, and constructivism sacrifice explanatory power
in the interest of analytical purity. Yet in understanding political
problems, we typically need to weigh the causal importance of different
types of factors, for example, material and ideal, international and
domestic.]{.underline} [Eclectic theorizing, not the insistence on
received paradigms, helps us understand inherently complex social and
political processes.]{.underline} (Katzenstein and Okawara, 2002) This
article has taken a theoretically open approach to identifying the
factors behind Arctic and Space cooperation; how states regularised that
cooperation; and how certain forms of decisionmaking and certain types
of legal instruments facilitate that process. It has been deliberately
open to finding different motivations for---and influences upon---state
behaviour, ranging from rational calculations of self-interest to the
development of shared identities and interests within epistemic
communities. It is not an article about international relations theory,
but it does open up a rich new domain for theorising. That said, the
continued role of the various factors involved in Arctic and Space
cooperation will be contingent on future technological, economic, and
political developments. [For example, the tragedies of the commons that
are unfolding in the Arctic and Space, namely climate change and space
debris, do not originate in these regions and have potentially
catastrophic spillover effects elsewhere.]{.underline} As David Welch
and others have pointed out, [melting Arctic permafrost is a ticking
methane bomb that could push the entire planet's climate to new and
increasingly unstable extremes (Welch, 2019). Similarly, runaway space
debris could render key Earth orbits unusable for a wide range of
services that are increasingly essential to human life on the surface.
Either of these developments could cause such deep ruptures in
international politics that neither Arctic nor Space cooperation would
survive.]{.underline} Less dramatically, the reliance on consensus
decision-making in the Arctic and Space could be challenged by the
involvement of new actors. Until now, the number of states involved in
Arctic and Space decision-making has been limited by either geography or
technology. But rapid climate change in the Arctic and equally rapid
technological change in Space are inducing and enabling the entry of
more state and non-state actors. It is unclear whether consensus
decision-making can survive in the Arctic Council once China becomes
fully involved in the region. For instance, one could imagine one of the
less powerful Arctic Council member states withstanding the pressure to
join in consensus on a particular issue, if it had economic and
political backing from a very powerful nonmember state. Similarly, the
influence exercised by Russia and the United States on decision-making
with COPUOS could be challenged by the ongoing rise of China as a Space
power. It is even possible that a less powerful state might be able to
withstand the pressure to join in consensus because of support from one
or more large companies. If this sounds improbable, consider the
influence of Liberia and Panama---the world's two largest shipping
registries---on decision-making within the International Maritime
Organization (Lee, Humphreys, & Pugh, 1997). The power of these tiny
'flag of convenience' states has been greatly magnified by the support
they receive from global shipping companies. Contingency, however, is an
inevitable consequence of complexity, and with the exception of complex
interdependence, none of the factors identified in this article are
prerequisites for the development of regional or issue-specific forms of
cooperation that are resilient to tensions and breakdowns elsewhere. And
even if one or more pro-cooperation factors were to disappear, they
might be replaced by new pro-cooperation factors.

### No capacity

#### US lacks operational capacity in the Arctic 

**Tingstead, Savitz, et al, 2023** (Scott Savitz is a senior engineer at
the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. Abbie Tingstad is an
adjunct senior researcher at RAND, 11-1-2023, \"Arctic Capabilities of
the U.S. Armed Forces\", No Publication,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1638-1.html>, DoA
6/5/2025, DVOG)

Shortfalls Analysis conducted over the course of this project suggests
that **[a primary limitation for the United States is capacity, rather
than capability, to operate in the Arctic]{.underline}**. (Capability
refers to what can be accomplished, while capacity refers to the volume,
frequency, or amount that can be done.) In other words, **[there is no
evidence of other Arctic actors being able to access parts of the Arctic
that the United States fundamentally cannot,]{.underline}** based on the
inventory of U.S. capabilities that are either currently available or
planned for the near term. However, **[the team found that Russia (in
both government and commercial interests) has the capacity to sustain a
strong day-to-day presence in the maritime Arctic in a way that the
United States does not. Furthermore, Russian knowledge of operating in
varying sea ice conditions is considerable,]{.underline}** although
safely navigating the maritime Arctic appears to be a challenge for all
actors. **[China's capacity is also growing, while the capacity of
several U.S. allies and like-minded partners is also growing or
steady,]{.underline}** with few exceptions. Other Arctic countries also
have a strong capability to operate across the Arctic land, coastal, and
air environments. The U.S. armed forces' most-urgent needs for Arctic
access and presence fall into the following categories:

• assets with proximity to support response

• multidomain awareness and communications

• infrastructure for response and logistics

• sufficient cadres of personnel who are trained, current, and
proficient with the skills to operate in this harsh environment

• tactics and equipment for low-probability, high-impact incidents

• the ability to scale presence.

In comparing U.S. Arctic capabilities with those of other Arctic states,
the research team observed that each of **[four attributes---capacity,
priority, capability, and interoperability---limits U.S. access to and
presence in the Arctic]{.underline}**. These attributes are defined in
Figure S.1. Most important is that the **[U.S. armed forces face a lack
of capacity in the region to meet strategic security interests in ways
articulated by national, departmental, and service-specific Arctic
strategies. There are simply not enough polar-capable assets and trained
personnel to ensure enduring presence across the region at
scale]{.underline}**. Also notable is that other Arctic actors' regional
capabilities are generally scaled to their geographies, needs, and
interests. In contrast, **[despite its polar interests, the United
States faces substantial capacity shortfalls in many
areas]{.underline}**. For example, as of this writing, the USCG had two
operational polar icebreakers: the half-century-old heavy icebreaker
USCG Cutter (USCGC) Polar Star and the medium icebreaker USCGC Healy.
Historically, aside from the period when the USCGC Polar Star was
temporarily out of service pending a major refit from 2006 through 2012,
the current fleet is the smallest it has been in the past 60 years, as
shown in Figure S.2. In the early 1960s, the USCG had eight icebreakers
capable of operating in the Arctic or Antarctic; as of this writing, it
had two active icebreakers capable of operating in the polar regions.
The capacity attribute is exacerbated by priority at the national level
for the Arctic, which drives decisions about global force management and
capability allocation and apportionment. **[The USCG would benefit from
operating in the Arctic with additional joint resources for domain
awareness, communications, and defensive capabilities. Achieving this
end could be hindered at least in part by the priority
attribute]{.underline}**, although we acknowledge that undertaking a
decision at the national level to prioritize more resources for the
Arctic would necessarily reduce resources for other important missions.
This report does not offer any recommendations as to whether the Arctic
should be prioritized, just that more assets might be available for the
region if it were afforded even higher priority. Capability issues also
exist, most prominently for domain awareness, communications, logistics,
and USCG defensive measures. However, these are, in part, similar
challenges for all Arctic actors. The main difference is that some other
actors have prioritized their existing capabilities for Arctic
operations to a greater extent than the United States has, and they have
invested in capacity (i.e., having more instances of those
capabilities). Finally, even where allies and partners have capabilities
that can mitigate U.S. military shortfalls in the Arctic, being able to
rely on those capabilities requires a high degree of interoperability.

Leaving these issues without resolution could lead to several types of
risk to U.S. regional interests, including the following:

• potential inability to fulfill responsibilities (e.g., for search and
rescue and oil spill response) when called on

• loss of life, property, economic potential, and environmental
integrity

• limitations in being able to operate with and rely on partners

• growth in Russian control and potential for aggression in concert with
a loss of possible opportunities to engage in positive diplomacy

• expansion of China's regional influence • accidental escalation of
NATO--Russia tensions

• global perception of U.S. absence and a security void, which would
exacerbate some of the other risks

• lack of control over Arctic narratives.

### Key to check Russia/China

#### Arctic key to check Russia and China 

**Garamone, 2024** (Jim Garamone, Dod News, 7-30-2024, \"Now the Hard

of Form, DoA 6/6/2024, DVOG)

The previous DOD strategy for the region came out in 2019, but much has
changed in the region and world since then. **[While the strategic
environment has changed dramatically, climate change is rapidly altering
the Arctic,]{.underline}** Dory said.  

The region \"is warming three times faster than the rest of the world,\"
she said. \"**[Melting ice and warmer temperatures, they affect DOD
operating context, and lead to increased human activity, including from
our competitors.\"]{.underline}**

**[Russia, with its large area above the Arctic Circle, is an obvious
competitor, but China is also a player]{.underline}**. \"The People\'s
Republic of China ... seeks increased access and influence in the region
and leverages the changing Arctic dynamics to take advantage of Arctic
resources and to seek a larger role in regional governance,\" she said.

**[Russia has continued its expansion and modernization of Arctic
military infrastructure]{.underline}**. \"The Arctic has long played a
significant role in Russia\'s security approach and economic
calculations, and today is no exception,\" Dory said. \"**[Russia\'s
Arctic military capabilities have the potential to hold the U.S.
homeland, as well as allied and partner territories, at
risk.\"]{.underline}** 

**[China and Russia are growing together and have held combined naval
patrols]{.underline}** in the region. DOD continues to monitor this
cooperation very closely.  

\"On the other side of the equation, the addition of Finland and Sweden
as NATO allies presents an opportunity to deepen collaboration on Arctic
security issues and strengthen security and defense and deterrence in
the region,\" she said. \"So, along with the evolution of the Arctic
geopolitically, the \[Defense\] Department is also evolving our approach
to the region. And the strategy seeks to update this approach so that it
is fit for purpose for this new era in the Arctic.\" 

More land is available in the region and sea lanes are opening. **[More
ships, planes, people are in the region, and this could increase the
risk of strategic competition and miscalculation in the
region]{.underline}**, Dory said. That is why the strategy --- really a
roadmap for cooperation --- is so important, the acting undersecretary
said. 

\"The Arctic strategy itself is transparent about the challenges that we
face in order to underscore the urgency of addressing them,\" she said.
\"It provides an action-oriented approach to address these challenges
and to realize our strategic guiding light.\"

The end state, she said, is that **[DOD, in cooperation with allies and
partners, looks to preserve the Arctic as a stable region in which the
U.S. homeland remains secure and vital national interests are
safeguarded.]{.underline}** \"We spend the bulk of the strategy for
diving into the ways we intend to get to that end state,\" she said.  

There are three main lines of effort. **[The first is to enhance domain
awareness and capabilities to campaign in the Arctic]{.underline}**.
These are the day-to-day operations, activities and investments in the
region. The second line of effort is to engage with allies and partners.
\"The third is exercising a calibrated presence in the region,\" Dory
said. 

Dealing with allies and partners is really key to this effort, she said.
Cooperation in the Arctic continues America\'s greatest asymmetric
advantage: the network of allies. \"The Arctic has a unique
concentration of like-minded and highly capable allies,\" she said.
\"Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and our two newest NATO allies,
Finland and Sweden, all bring substantial regional know-how and
capability that strengthens our collective efforts to monitor and
respond in the Arctic.\" 

There is already a baseline for this effort. For example, \"the U.S.
Marine Corps has long maintained pre-positioned combat equipment in
Norway to improve our ability to respond rapidly alongside Arctic allies
should deterrence fail,\" Dory said. \"We\'ve also increased rotations
of maritime patrol aircraft to Iceland to improve maritime domain
awareness when necessary and will continue to participate in Icelandic
air policing efforts.\" 

The United States has also signed defense cooperative agreements with
Sweden, Finland and Denmark, and updated a similar long-standing
agreement with Norway. \"In Europe and North America, we\'ve enhanced
our tailored presence through U.S. participation in exercises like
Nordic Response in the European Arctic, and Arctic Edge in Alaska.
Allies and partners are also a source of innovation and we\'re working
together to develop and feel the next generation of Arctic
capabilities.\" 

Canada and the United States are already modernizing for the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, and the United States is
interoperable with a number of partner nations in the F-35 jet program
and the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. \"We\'re building
innovative partnerships such as one with Norway, which is hosting a U.S.
payload aboard Norway\'s Arctic satellite broadband mission, \[which
will\] bring much needed communications capabilities to our strategic
users in the Arctic region,\" Dory said.  

\"Going forward, we will look to identify opportunities to collaborate
more closely on Arctic capabilities research, development and
acquisition,\" she said. \"Additionally, we\'ll explore ways to deepen
intelligence and information sharing to maintain a shared threat
perception of the Arctic region.\" 

DOD looks to work more closely with U.S. entities as well, from the U.S.
Coast Guard to state government entities to Alaskan natives to industry
partners. \"We support the Coast Guard\'s program to strengthen U.S.
icebreaking capability, as it enables a key capability to ensure
interoperability between the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy vessels, and
to support U.S. presence in the Arctic,\" Dory said. \"The recent
announcement of U.S., Canada and Finland to collaborate on icebreaker
production is yet another example of the incredible cooperation
potential among Arctic allies to drive collective innovation and
capabilities.\"

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

**[The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early
warning signs that the region could become a site of future
conflict.]{.underline}** In 2021 Russia and China renewed their
20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, a move described as "an act of friendship against
America."^9)^ Moreover, **[both Russia and China have deep historic and
economic ties to the Arctic. NATO's expansion to include Finland and
Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while both Russia and
China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in
the Arctic.]{.underline}**^10)^ However, despite feeling antagonized by
NATO's actions, Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and
military capacities to reshape the current international rules-based
order in the Arctic in the near term.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region.^11)^ Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not
new. Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to the
sixteenth century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was
part of a larger initiative to search for resources and trade
routes.^12)^ As the nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well.
During the Cold War, the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval
presence on the Kola Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of
the Soviet nuclear arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic
power.

**[As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and
defenses.^13)^ Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would
refocus its military power on the Arctic and Nordic
region.]{.underline}**^14)^ According to Colin Wall, a research
associate at Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, "**[The military balance in the Arctic is heavily weighted
towards Russia]{.underline}**." Furthermore, the International Institute
for Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that **[Russia's bases inside the
Arctic Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.^15)^ Russia's
remilitarization of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership
with China, provides both countries with the means to challenge the
current Western rules-based international order.]{.underline}**

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, **[Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has
rapidly evolved]{.underline}** over the past century. China's
involvement in the Arctic began in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard
Treaty, providing a legal basis for China to conduct non-military
activity, such as scientific exploration, resource extraction, and
fishing in the Arctic.^16)^ However, **[China's rationale to operate in
the region extends beyond scientific exploration.]{.underline}**

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."^17)^ **[China employs a dual narrative to
explain its aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign
audiences by advocating for the safeguarding of international interests
and promoting sustainable Arctic development. However, this is
juxtaposed against the narrative it promotes for domestic audiences,
which emphasizes competition for resources and China's desire to become
a "polar great power."^18)^ The Svalbard Treaty has currently enabled
China to shroud its military activity and influence in the Arctic as
scientific exploration and global cooperation. But it is becoming clear
from its growing partnership with Russia and increasingly aggressive
military action in the Arctic that China's intentions to reshape the
international system extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. and
NATO would be wise to recognize China's aims in the
Arctic.]{.underline}**

T**[he historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions
reveal that the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition.]{.underline}** Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has
temporarily bolstered the West's position in the Arctic, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's accession into NATO
not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by over 650 percent and
moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from St. Petersburg, but it
also contributed to creating a divided Arctic, where nearly half belongs
to NATO while the remaining half is Russian territory.

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.^19)^ In February 2023, Putin made
good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with tactical
nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this was the
first time in 30 years that this has happened.^20)^ Then in June 2024,
Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical nuclear
weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members Norway,
Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.^21)^ As evidenced by
these actions, **[while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber,
it is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO.]{.underline}**

**[NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to
prepare for conflict against Russia]{.underline}**. In 2024 the head of
the Norwegian armed forces warned that NATO countries only have two to
three years to prepare for a Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik
Kristoffersen claims that Moscow is building up its military stockpile
faster than previously predicted, while Western nations have depleted
their own weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.^22)^ Several other
European leaders have echoed these concerns, citing that they have
between three and eight years to prepare for a Russian attack against
NATO.^23)^ Despite Russia's aggressive rhetoric, Moscow understands that
because of its war against Ukraine it likely will not have the
capability to attack NATO in the near future. For instance, Russia
removed nearly all its ground forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine
in June 2024.^24)^ **[Russia's timeframe to launch a successful attack
is dependent not only on its economy but also on its partnership with
the PRC.]{.underline}**

#### Lack of US Arctic presence cedes it to Russia (AT: Russia DA?) 

**Tingstead, Savitz, et al, 2023** (Scott Savitz is a senior engineer at

6/5/2025, DVOG)

Loss of Opportunities to Engage and Counter Russia

**[Limitations on U.S. Arctic access means that there are fewer
opportunities to engage and counter Russia when needed. There is value
to this in the spirit of engagement and keeping lines of communication
open with a neighboring country,]{.underline}** Russia's present attack
on Ukraine and the subsequent pause of Arctic Council meetings
notwithstanding.18 The two countries must comanage activities in the
Bering Strait region and, in theory, could back up each other's SAR and
other nonmilitary mission needs because of their geographic proximity.
**[Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, the United States and Russia are
maintaining a low level of cooperation for dealing with emergencies in
the Bering Strait area]{.underline}**.19 **[More access would also shore
up the United States' ability to convincingly counter any aggression
from Russia, including antiaccess campaigns in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** Our summary of Russia's Arctic ambitions and
activities (Appendix B, available online) suggests that **[one of the
greatest concerns for the United States in this regard would arise from
Russia's attempts to control traffic in the NSR, with which the United
States disagrees but has limited capacity to challenge in a way that
does not result in vertical and horizontal escalation. The other major
sore spot for Russia in the Arctic is the posturing of NATO forces close
to its military stronghold in and around the Kola Peninsula, near
Russia's border with Norway. Overall, the United States has robust
strategic assets and strategic-deterrence capabilities. However, an
increased number of operational and tactical assets in
Alaska]{.underline}** (and potentially also closer to eastern North
America) **[would give the United States possibly less escalatory but
still effective options.]{.underline}**

#### Lack of US presence means China will fill the gap

Tacit Acceptance of China's Influence

**[If China's Arctic presence grows and transforms, the United States
risks appearing to have all bark and no bite in the region without more
day-to-day presence. China could fill this gap.]{.underline}** As in the
case of Russia, **[tactical- and operational-level assets would be more
valuable for this---to prevent escalation and to address the problems
likeliest to be associated with China, such as illegal, unreported, and
unregulated]{.underline}** (IUU) **[fishing]{.underline}** 20 **[and
covert intelligence operations. China declared itself as a "near-Arctic
state"]{.underline}** as early as 2012.21 It has also argued that the
Arctic region constituted a global commons that should be shared by all
states, not simply the eight that adjoin it. **[There are concerns that
China might use its long-distance fishing fleet---the world's
largest---to fish in the central Arctic following the expiration of the
Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreemen]{.underline}**t (CAOFA) in 2034.
**[These fishing vessels could be dual-use civilian--military assets to
monitor U.S., allied, and partners' military activities.]{.underline}**
China is demonstrating its seriousness in Arctic operations in the
construction of a third icebreaker, the Xue Long 3; efforts to construct
scientific and ground satellite stations in some Arctic states;
significant economic and infrastructure investments in Iceland and
Scandinavia; and the Xue Long 1's and Xue Long 2's repeated passages
through Canada's NWP to "fly the flag" and demonstrate China's ice
capabilities.22 However, China is very unlikely to challenge the United
States militarily in the Arctic. Rather, **[China is seeking to gain
influence through economic means and by participating in rulemaking.
Although its influence in the Arctic Council is constrained by its
observer status, IMO and other international bodies to which China is
party help create rules that apply to the Arctic. Gaining additional
experience operating in the Arctic could indirectly help the U.S. armed
forces inform (as appropriate) U.S. government decisions about what
rules are needed or not and help regulate China's activity in
U.S.-administered parts of the Arctic when the U.S. armed forces are in
law-enforcement roles or supporting civilian missions.]{.underline}**

**[While the world should hope a full-scale conflict between US and
China can be avoided, relations between the two superpowers continue to
deteriorate]{.underline}**. Now politicians, experts, and even
America\'s military leaders have started to raise the question: Just how
prepared is the US if the threats from Beijing become something more
serious?

War in the Western Pacific is likely not an immediate danger, [according
to

but it is a possibility. **[Were the US to end up in a war with China,

territory and is seen as a challenge to its authoritarian rule.
President Joe Biden

the US would come to Taiwan\'s defense if China attacked, a break from

rivals, the US and China could also find themselves at war for other
reasons, such as
China\'s]{.underline}[ militarization](https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-map-china-outposts-south-china-sea-spratly-islands-2023-3)[ of
the South China Sea, where US and Chinese military ships and planes

**[American intelligence officials
have]{.underline}[ asserted](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-worldwide-threats-hearing/)[ that
China is the \"most consequential threat to US national security,\" and

\"onslaught\" of military threats for which the US was unprepared. A war
would likely devastate the militaries involved and plunge the global
economy into peril]{.underline}** --- a bleak scenario with far-reaching
consequences. Any **[war with China would be fought on multiple fronts
--- from the air and sea to the web and financial
markets]{.underline}**. While the US has plenty of advantages, years of
underinvestment and complacency have left America lacking in several key
areas that it would need to strengthen to successfully counter threats
from China. Top officials, such as Gen. Mark Milley, the chair of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, agree America needs to bolster its readiness.

\"There is nothing more expensive than fighting a war,\" [the general
said](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3344920/milley-says-war-with-china-russia-not-inevitable/) during
a House Armed Services Committee hearing in spring. \"And preparing for
war is also very expensive, but fighting a war is the most expensive.
Preparing for war will deter that war.\"

**[While it would be foolhardy to predict the outcome of a war between
the US and China, the possibility of it happening certainly has experts
warning that America is unprepared]{.underline}**.

The evolving international order has mostly been divided into two
categories of powers: status quo and revisionist. The latter, as the
term signifies, are powers who aim to revise the existing global systems
or order by altering it gradually or overthrowing it completely through
new measures or initiatives. A gradual change would indicate the rise of
an evolutionary revisionist power, while a sudden or rapid change
indicates a revolutionary revisionist power. Essentially, [a revisionist
power aims to enhance its power, **status and authority**]{.underline}
in global decision-making process, [seeking to remodel the international
system, and eventually the order, in its favor.]{.underline} A
revolutionary revisionist power views such an endeavor through the
lenses of realism. 13 Alternatively, an evolutionary revisionist power
follows the idealist school of thought, or a gradualist path: it would
not necessarily confront the established great powers in seeking to
change the existing international systems and order. 14

Scholars, such as John Mearsheimer and Suisheng Zhao, argue that [rising
powers such as China]{.underline} and India, [with the potential to
emerge as major]{.underline} (or great) [powers]{.underline}, would
[continue to pose challenges for the existing international system and
order.]{.underline} 15 The intensity to compete, perhaps to challenge
the existing system or order, is more noticeable in China than in other
powers, highlighting that **[China is more 'revisionist' than a normal
'status quo' power]{.underline}**. 16 The [reasons behind China's
perception as a revisionist power in Indo-Pacific are **appositely
clear**]{.underline}. [These include authoritarian and unilateral
initiatives to bring out **fast-track infrastructure**]{.underline}
development along with connectivity [through the]{.underline} flagship
Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI]{.underline}) [and assertive claims in
the **maritime domains**]{.underline}, [such as the South China Sea and
East China Sea]{.underline} disputes. Further, [mounting claims over
**land territories**]{.underline} and [attempts to create a distinct
order through the creation of international institutions]{.underline} or
forums that [are evidently linked to China's national interests are also
important factors]{.underline}. 17 On account of this[, **the tag of
revisionism on Beijing appears** today to be **justified**]{.underline}.
18

Defining a status quo power is fairly simple: they are powers that are
primarily content with the fundamental characteristics of the prevailing
global order and power distribution. 19 Accepting globalization and
international organizations by willingly participating or being a part
of them is a key trait of a status quo power. Despite the reservations
that it holds on a range of subjects pertaining to the established
institutions or organizations, Beijing has been an active member,
participant and beneficiary of the international liberal order or the
Bretton Woods institutions and other existing international or regional
multilateral organizations. Long has China reaped the benefits of the
Bretton Woods institutions, even though it has always expressed its
displeasure, stating that these institutions are not developing society
friendly mannerisms and are primarily dominated by the Western
influence. Equally, China established the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO); has been an active partner of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); is a founding member of the United
Nations (UN); and holds a permanent seat in the United Nations Security
Council (UNSC), to enhance its international interest. 20

In contrast, [a revisionist power is one that is dissatisfied with the
global order and wants to change the existing norms t]{.underline}hat
have been created by the status quo powers. As explained by political
scientist Randall Schweller, a revisionist state wants to 'undermine'
the existing order so as to increase its own power in the system. 21 In
the case of China, [an article by the **Chinese M**]{.underline}inistry
of **[F]{.underline}**oreign **[A]{.underline}**ffairs on [the creation
of '**two China's'** in the United Nations highlights the country's
dissatisfaction with the established order, and mainly the
US]{.underline}. 22 Such [dissatisfaction is no more a secret
phenomenon]{.underline} in the Chinese public discourse. Most [domestic
debates in China are centered around the dialogue on how Beijing's rise
must bring revisions to the existing international systems]{.underline}
or create new systems. Nevertheless, the emerging 'great' power does not
seem to fall clearly under either category. It has recently started
advocating for a far more active role in the UN; and since assuming a
permanent seat in the UNSC in 1971, used its veto power only 14 times,
the lowest of the permanent five. 23 At the same time, it [has become an
increasingly **assertive regional power**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} has, since the launch of its BRI in 2013, [factored
greatly on the US watch as a 'threat that is greater than
terrorism']{.underline}. 24

Revisionism also draws greatly from the power transition theory of
international relations. 25 It was A.F.K. Organski who in his book World
Politics first propagated the power transition theory while
simultaneously predicting the possible rise of China and the effect it
would have on international power politics. 26 [Power transition theory
has two major premises: (]{.underline}1) internal [growth or development
is the source of power for a country an]{.underline}d (2) the [existing
international order during the time of another power's 'rise' is shaped
by a hegemon.]{.underline} 27 China'[s economic growth in the past
decade has been nothing short of a miracle; from]{.underline} a
primarily agrarian economy, China has developed into an industrial
dynamo, more importantly emerging as a donor country. 28 It is this very
remarkable growth that has marked China, in the eyes of the US, as a
revisionist power---in 2014, [China overtook,]{.underline} although
briefly, [the US]{.underline} as the largest economy of the world, [in
terms of purchasing power parity]{.underline} (PPP). 29

It is important to note that efforts by the reigning dominant power to
allay the concerns of the challenging powers can lower the possibility
of a power transition conflict. However, that did not happen in the case
of the US vis-à-vis China. The election of Donald Trump as president in
2016 marked a major turning point in the US approach towards China. 30
Unlike the previous US administration, Trump's hostility to Chinese
advances, from bilateral to regional dealings, has been vocal, direct
and critical. 31 Fortunately, [until the time China's military strength
is able to match that of the US, major war between the two competing
powers in not really foreseen]{.underline}. As Schweller argues, [a key
characteristic of a revisionist power is that it will '**employ military
force'**]{.underline} in order to disrupt the status quo; this has not
been the case with China in respect to the US. 32 [While Chinese
military assertiveness in the South China Sea and within its own borders
has been open, it has not engaged in a military conflict]{.underline}
with the US, the dominant power. The trade war between the US and China,
however, represented a geo-economic conflict between both the powers.
The trade war intensified in 2019, although the finalizing of a 'phase
one' deal at the beginning of 2020 marks an optimistic sign. 33 The
inking of the deal allayed fears that the US--China relations were
deteriorating faster than they could be mended.

China as the greatest threat to the United States. [Nearly two centuries
of humiliation of China by the West]{.underline}, beginning at least
with the Opium War of 1842 to make Chinese drug addiction a western
profit center. The United States followed with the Chinese Exclusion Act
of 1882 and a prohibition on the naturalization of Chinese immigrants.
The United States betrayed China during the post-World War I Paris Peace
talks by surrendering Shandong Province to Japan. Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles refused to shake the hand of Chinese Premier Zhou
Enlai during the Geneva Conference to settle the future of Vietnam and
gratuitously sneered that the two would only meet in a car crash.
[Taiwan is the same distance from the Chinese mainland as Cuba is to the
United States]{.underline}. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, [we
were willing to initiate war if necessary to compel the Soviet Union to
remove tactical nuclear weapons from Cuba,]{.underline} including a
blockade. Cuba had requested the missiles to deter a planned second
United States invasion on the heels of the Bay of Pigs debacle. The USSR
blinked and removed the nuclear weapons in exchange for a sotto voce
agreement by the United States to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey.
Today, [the United States is a **vastly greater existential threat** to
China than the Soviet Union's presence in Cuba was to the United States
in 1962. Why does anyone think China would react less strongly than the
United States did]{.underline} in the Cuban Missile Crisis to the U.S.
arming Taiwan to the teeth, **[repeatedly threatening
war]{.underline}**, **[organizing the Quad]{.underline}**, **[strangling
the Chinese economy]{.underline}**, and [treating the South China Sea as
if it were the Gulf of Mexico]{.underline}? Why would the Chinese accept
national security risks that the United States has shown it will not?
[U.S. relations with China are **combustible**]{.underline}. [Only a
**spark** is necessary to ignite a **conflagration** that could lead to
**nuclear exchanges** and **threaten the species with nuclear winter and
extinction**]{.underline}. Something similar happened before with
Austrian Archduke Ferdinand's assassination by Serb nationalist Gavrilo
Princip on June 28, 1914. That gave birth to World War I, which
witnessed 20 million deaths and 21 million wounded. World War III could
be precipitated by a shoot-out over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands or the
Scarborough Shoal/Huangyan Island. [A war involving the U.S. and China
would probably **metastasize**]{.underline}. According to the Brookings
Institution's Michael O'Hanlon: "[Neither Beijing nor Washington would
accept defeat in a limited engagement. Instead, the conflict probably
would expand **horizontally** to other regions and
**vertically**]{.underline}, perhaps [even to include **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} threats---or their actual **[use]{.underline}**.
It literally could [become the worst catastrophe in the history of
warfare]{.underline}." In recent years, U.S. wargames have generally
shown China defeating the United States. One analysis concluded: "The
overarching takeaway from participants in the war game: If China invades
Taiwan, the Indo-​Pacific region will plunge into a broad, drawn-​out war
that could include direct attacks on the U.S., including Hawaii and
potentially the continental United States." If a war with China over
Taiwan seems crazy, it's because it is! We have no defense treaty with
Taiwan. We have no diplomatic relations with Taiwan. It has no
membership in the United Nations. It is within China's traditional
sphere of influence. It is more than 7,500 miles away from the United
States. Its independence is a featherweight to our national security. If
China annexed Taiwan, imitating our annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the
annexation would not be an existential threat to the United States. I
can already hear the appeasement shouts of "Munich," "Munich," "Munich"
from the multi-trillion-dollar military-industrial-security complex. But
[China is not the Third Reich, President Xi Jinping is not Adolf Hitler.
Taiwan is not Czechoslovakia]{.underline}. And the [Domino Theory
implicit in the cry of "Munich" was discredited by our defeat by
Vietnam]{.underline}. It has become a semi-ally of the United States in
opposing China. And Japan and South Korea are fully capable of defending
themselves against a Chinese invasion. President George Washington's
time-honored Farewell Address provides the path to extricate ourselves
from a war with China over Taiwan: "The great rule of conduct for us in
regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to
have with them as little political connection as possible."

### Yes Russia War 

#### US-Russia war causes extinction

**Hammill 19 --** (Jasper Hamill, 8-21-2019, \"Nuclear war between the
US and Russia would cause a devastating \'global famine\',\" Metro,
https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/life-will-like-survivors-nuclear-war-us-russia-10607611/)

[Anyone who survives a nuclear war]{.underline} might count themselves
lucky for a few short moments but [will]{.underline} probably then
**[wish they were dead]{.underline}**. A new scientific study has
revealed how [atomic conflict will plunge Earth into a post-apocalyptic
'winter']{.underline} that's almost too grim to imagine. Researchers
calculated what would happen if [the **US and Russia launched their
nuclear arsenals** during a war of **mutually assured
destruction**]{.underline}. They confirmed that [burning cities and
forests would throw so much soot into the air that the whole planet
**would shiver** through a freezing '**nuclear winter' lasting up to 10
years**]{.underline}. This would [blot out the sun's light, stop crops
from growing and cause a '**global famine' that could kill billions** or
even **send the whole of humanity into extinction**]{.underline}. A team
from Rutgers University and the University of Colorado carried out
sophisticated simulations to reveal the [severity of a nuclear
winter]{.underline}. They wrote: '[Massive forest ﬁres ignited by
nuclear weapons would rage for weeks after a war, producing a pall of
smoke that would obscure the Sun and reduce sunlight at the surface for
the duration of the ﬁres]{.underline}.' 'A [nuclear winter could occur
from this smoke]{.underline},' they added. 'In a war where nuclear
weapons would be used, [military and industrial centers located in urban
areas would be targeted, which contain fuel loading much higher than
forests, thus creating an enormous amount of smoke when
burned]{.underline}. 'Urban ﬁres injecting smoke into the upper
troposphere could [produce severe climate changes and that urban
ﬁrestorms could inject smoke into the stratosphere, leading to rapid
interhemispheric transport and a long‐lasting smoke pall]{.underline}.'
The simulation suggests '[surface light levels remain below
40%]{.underline} of normal for 3 years, returning to normal after about
10 years [after the war starts.]{.underline} This would mean
[temperatures barely get above freezing in midsummer in many parts of
the world, causing a 'near 90% reduction in the growing season' and
leaving **billions at risk of starvation**]{.underline}. The authors
called for immediate nuclear disarmament and added: 'A [full‐scale
nuclear attack would be suicidal for the country that decides to carry
out such an attack]{.underline}. 'The [use of nuclear weapons in this
manner by the **U**nited **S**tates and Russia would have disastrous
consequences globally]{.underline}. To completely remove the
[possibility of an environmental catastrophe as a result of a full‐scale
nuclear]{.underline} war, decision-makers must have a full understanding
of the grave climatic consequences of nuclear war and act accordingly.
'Ultimately, the reduction of nuclear arsenals and the eventual
disarmament of all nuclear-capable parties are needed.'

#### Russia war outweighs on [magnitude]{.underline}.

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and **Russia**]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the
direct effects of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The
aftermath could be **much worse**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials could send massive amounts
of smoke into the atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight
and cause sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural
disruption -- **[a nuclear winter]{.underline}**.

According to one model 9, [an all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global temperatures of
around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food for**]{.underline} 4 to
[**5 years**. This could leave some survivors]{.underline} in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, [but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the **threat of extinction from other sources would be
great**. An exchange on this scale is **only possible between the US and
Russia** who have more than 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each,
although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that
even [a small regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear weapons
would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious enough to [put two
billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of starvation,12
[though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale are **unlikely to lead
to**]{.underline} outright **[human extinction]{.underline}**, but this
does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns.

[It is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the
probability of **existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over
the next century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence
intervals. According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear
war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals, the risk of human extinction is **plausibly greater**
from a conflict between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **Russia**]{.underline}. Tensions between
these countries have increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable
to rule out the possibility of them rising further in the future.

Now 10 years ago, several of the world's leading climatologists and
physicists chose to reinvestigate the long-term environmental impacts of
nuclear war. [The **peer-reviewed studies** they produced are considered
to be the most authoritative type of scientific research, which is

Alan Robock et al., "Climatic consequences of regional nuclear
conflicts," Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 7 (2007). Working at the
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of
Colorado-Boulder, the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers,
and the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, [these
scientists used **state-of-the-art computer modeling** to evaluate the
consequences of a range of possible nuclear conflicts]{.underline}. They
began with a hypothetical war in Southeast Asia, in which a total of 100
Hiroshima-size atomic bombs were detonated in the cities of India and
Pakistan. Please consider the following images of Hiroshima, before and
after the detonation of the atomic bomb, which had an explosive power of
15,000 tons of TNT. The detonation of an atomic bomb with this explosive
power will instantly ignite fires over a surface area of three to five
square miles. In the recent studies, the scientists calculated that the
blast, fire, and radiation from a war fought with 100 atomic bombs could
produce direct fatalities comparable to all of those worldwide in World
War II, or to those once estimated for a "counterforce" nuclear war
between the superpowers. However, the long-term environmental effects of
the war could significantly disrupt the global weather for at least a
decade, which would likely result in a vast global famine. The
scientists predicted that nuclear firestorms in the burning cities would
cause at least five million tons of black carbon smoke to quickly rise
above cloud level into the stratosphere, where it could not be rained
out. The smoke would circle the Earth in less than two weeks and would
form a global stratospheric smoke layer that would remain for more than
a decade. The smoke would absorb warming sunlight, which would heat the
smoke to temperatures near the boiling point of water, producing ozone
losses of 20 to 50 percent over populated areas. This would almost
double the amount of UV-B reaching the most populated regions of the
mid-latitudes, and it would create UV-B indices unprecedented in human
history. In North America and Central Europe, the time required to get a
painful sunburn at mid-day in June could decrease to as little as six
minutes for fair-skinned individuals. As the smoke layer blocked warming
sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, it would produce the coldest
average surface temperatures in the last 1,000 years. The scientists
calculated that global food production would decrease by 20 to 40
percent during a five-year period following such a war. Medical experts
have predicted that the shortening of growing seasons and corresponding
decreases in agricultural production could cause up to two billion
people to perish from famine. The climatologists also investigated the
effects of a nuclear war fought with the vastly more powerful modern
thermonuclear weapons possessed by the United States, Russia, China,
France, and England. Some of the thermonuclear weapons constructed
during the 1950s and 1960s were 1,000 times more powerful than an atomic
bomb. During the last 30 years, the average size of thermonuclear or
"strategic" nuclear weapons has decreased. Yet today, [each of the
approximately 3,540 strategic weapons deployed by the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia is seven to 80
times more powerful than the atomic bombs modeled in the India-Pakistan
study]{.underline}. The smallest strategic nuclear weapon has an
explosive power of 100,000 tons of TNT, compared to an atomic bomb with
an average explosive power of 15,000 tons of TNT. [Strategic nuclear
weapons produce much larger nuclear firestorms than do atomic
bombs]{.underline}. For example, [a standard Russian 800-kiloton
warhead]{.underline}, on an average day, [will ignite fires covering a
surface area of 90 to 152 square miles]{.underline}. [A war fought with
hundreds]{.underline} or thousands [of **U.S. and Russian** strategic
nuclear weapons would ignite immense nuclear firestorms covering land
surface areas of many thousands or tens of thousands of square
miles]{.underline}. The scientists calculated that [these fires would
produce up to 180 million tons of black carbon soot and smoke, which
would form a dense, global stratospheric smoke layer]{.underline}. [The
smoke would remain in the stratosphere for 10 to **20 years**, and it
would block]{.underline} as much as [70 percent of sunlight]{.underline}
from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere and 35 percent from
the Southern Hemisphere. So much sunlight would be blocked by the smoke
that the noonday sun would resemble a full moon at midnight. [Under such
conditions, it would only require a **matter of days** or weeks for
daily minimum temperatures to fall below freezing in the largest
agricultural areas of the Northern Hemisphere]{.underline}, where
freezing temperatures would occur every day for a period of between one
to more than two years. [Average surface temperatures would become
colder than those experienced 18,000 years ago at the height of the last
Ice Age, and the prolonged cold would cause average rainfall to decrease
by up to 90%]{.underline}. [Growing seasons would be completely
eliminated for more than a decade; it would be too cold and dark to grow
food crops, which would **doom the majority of the human
population**]{.underline}.

### Climate Modelling key to Agriculture

#### Space based Climate modelling key to agriculture---solves hunger and supply disruptions 

**Bates, 2021** (Sophie, NASA, 7-26-2021, \"NASA At Your Table: The
Space Agency's Surprising Role in Agriculture\",
<https://www.nasa.gov/missions/landsat/nasa-at-your-table-the-space-agencys-surprising-role-in-agriculture/>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

**[Food is a basic necessity]{.underline}**, and it is at the heart of
every human culture and our sense of home. It also represents one of our
most important connections to Earth. Crops and animal products, whether
gathered from the ocean or the land, raised on farms big and small,
across vast fields or in our backyards and urban communities, draw on
sunlight, water and soil to grow and thrive.

Producing food has always been challenging, and in the 21st century,
**[human-caused climate change is already affecting food security
through increasing temperatures, the frequency of extreme events and
changing precipitation patterns. This is increasing the risk of food
supply disruptions]{.underline}** by shifting growing and pastoral
zones, reducing water access and food yield---all of which contribute to
the changing landscape of our food and water supply.

In addition, **[more than 800 million people suffer from chronic hunger
worldwide. By 2050, the global population is estimated to grow to 10
billion people. As the population---and the demand for food---continues
to expand, we need innovative ways to feed the world.]{.underline}**   
            

That's where NASA Earth science data comes in. 

**[In the satellite era, Earth observing data has increasingly become
part of the food farming process. With observations from space and
aircraft, combined with high-end computer modeling, NASA scientists work
with partner agencies, organizations, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and
decision makers to share our understanding of the relationship between
the Earth system and the environments that provide us
food.]{.underline}**

Working with local communities and decision makers to determine their
needs and how they can best use Earth observation data, NASA supports
those who address issues like water management for irrigation, crop-type
identification and land use, coastal and lake water quality monitoring,
drought preparedness, and famine early warnings. 

#### Arctic climate modelling key to agricultural adaptation\--models must be balanced and diverse 

**Basso, 2022** (Bruno Basso, TRELLIS Analyst, 3-9-2022, \"Crop modeling
can scale regenerative agriculture to address climate change\", Trellis,
<https://trellis.net/article/crop-modeling-can-scale-regenerative-agriculture-address-climate-change/>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

**[Climate change is pressing]{.underline}** ahead, and **[the race is
on to find impactful ways to curtail it. Regenerative agricultural
practices have shown to store considerable quantities of carbon in the
soil and to keep it out of the atmosphere]{.underline}**. Transitioning
from familiar conventional practices to more sustainable ones can be
risky for farmers. But what if this risk could be estimated and even
eliminated?

**[Farmers operate within a complex system, with multiple components
that affect the behavior and growth of plants. With so many factors in
play, any change in how farmers manage their land can present multiple
what-ifs.]{.underline}**

The magic of models

In addition to this complexity, soil and environmental conditions vary
from field to field, and even within a single field. Spatial variability
of soil properties makes conventional soil sampling difficult to scale
and transfer the results from one place to another. Samples need to be
strategically selected in space with knowledge of the variability. But
their true value increases exponentially when used with crop models.

**[Crop models have been around for four decades]{.underline}**,
although mostly in the academic research domain. **[With progress in
agricultural science, computational power and greater availability of
public datasets on soil and climate, they are finally being used to help
stakeholders make more informed decisions.]{.underline}**

Some models were developed to advance scientific knowledge and help
provide answers and insights into complex mechanisms. These require many
inputs that are not easily measurable, and thus must be estimated by
users. Such estimation increases the uncertainties of results. Other
models are based on readily available inputs with the goal of solving
problems and supporting stakeholders in their decision-making.

Model balancing act

**[Models must have a balanced approach between the number and quality
of input variables and the robustness in the simulation of complex
processes and interactions. Unbalanced models tend to capture a high
level of detail in some better-known processes, often neglecting details
of less-understood processes of equal importance.]{.underline}**

For example, it's not helpful to have a detailed simulation of plant
photosynthesis if the soil processes providing water and nutrients for
the plant are not represented with the same level of detail. It's not
helpful to have a complex soil carbon model if it cannot reasonably
simulate yields, root water and nutrient uptake. The quality results
depend on the least-represented process simulated in the model. The
appropriateness or fitness of the model depends on how well the results
it delivers answer the questions being asked.

Further, **[models need to be validated across soil, climate and
management conditions to build trust from the agricultural players who
need them to scale results of practices to help adapt to and mitigate
climate change.]{.underline}**

#### Earth observation allows agriculture models based on data 

**Thomas, 4/15/2025** (Jack, \"How Earth observation is cultivating the
future of agriculture\", Innovation News Network,
<https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/how-earth-observation-is-cultivating-the-future-of-agriculture/57176/>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

**[Earth observation uses satellites and remote sensing to collect data
about agricultural landscapes. By analysing crop health, soil
conditions, and land use, EO equips farmers with the tools for precision
farming -- maximising yield while minimising waste.]{.underline}**

Techniques like multi-spectral imaging and NDVI (Normalised Difference
Vegetation Index) help detect plant stressors such as disease and
nutrient deficiencies. This allows for timely interventions that enhance
productivity and reduce the need for chemical inputs.

Additionally, **[EO provides insight into environmental variables --
weather, pest activity, and irrigation needs -- supporting smarter
decisions that build resilience in the face of climate
change.]{.underline}**

Boosting yields with satellite insights

**[Satellites enable real-time monitoring of crops, offering farmers
precise data on plant health. Imaging technologies -- especially NDVI --
identify areas needing attention, enabling targeted use of water,
fertilisers, and pesticides. This precision boosts yields while reducing
waste.]{.underline}**

**[Satellite-driven models can also predict harvest outcomes with high
accuracy]{.underline}** (R² values up to 0.71). These forecasts allow
farmers to plan ahead, manage risk, and optimise returns.

Monitoring water, weather, and soil from space

**[EO gives farmers a bird's-eye view of the vital elements of
agriculture -- water, weather, and soil.]{.underline}**

Soil moisture data informs irrigation, reducing water waste.

Weather forecasting helps plan planting, fertilising, and pest control
activities.

Soil analysis supports crop rotation and fertilisation strategies,
maintaining long-term soil health.

Together, these insights enhance resource management, lower costs, and
promote sustainability.

Reducing waste and environmental impact

EO technologies help reduce agriculture's environmental footprint
through smarter resource use.

By enabling precision application of water, fertilisers, and pesticides,
EO cuts input waste and limits chemical runoff.

**[Hyperspectral imaging further supports sustainability by monitoring
soil nutrients, helping reduce dependency on synthetic fertilisers.
These capabilities align modern agriculture with global conservation
goals.]{.underline}**

**[Key Contributions:]{.underline}**

Resource optimisation

Early stress detection

Sustainable nutrient management

Lower environmental impact

Predicting pests, droughts, and crop failures

EO allows early detection of threats like droughts, pest outbreaks, and
crop disease by analysing vegetation indices such as NDVI.

Predictive models that blend historical and current satellite data
enable timely interventions, reducing losses and increasing resilience.

This proactive approach empowers farmers to stay ahead of environmental
stressors, preserving crop yields and supporting food security.

Empowering farmers with data

**[Access to satellite data is transforming traditional farming into
precision agriculture. Farmers now receive real-time insights into soil
conditions, crop health, and weather risks, enabling faster, smarter
decisions.]{.underline}**

### Food Wars

#### Food wars are likely and cause nuclear winter

Julian **Cribb 20**, fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological
Sciences and Engineering and former director of national awareness for
the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation, 01/02/20, Hotspots for future 'Food wars' identified,
http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2020/01/hotspots-for-future-food-wars-identified/

**[Rising tensions over]{.underline}** [scarcities of]{.underline}
**[food,]{.underline}** land and water [combined with]{.underline}
increasingly [unstable climates threaten to unleash]{.underline} **[new
wars]{.underline}** [and the **mass flight**]{.underline} [of hundreds
of]{.underline} **[millions]{.underline}** [of people by the
mid-century.]{.underline}

'Food or War' identifies the [nine regions]{.underline} globally [most
at risk of conflict over **dwindling food resources**]{.underline},
water especially.

"Media and political descriptions of modern wars often overlook the fact
that [a **majority** of modern conflicts are driven by **scarcity of the
resources**]{.underline} [need to produce food]{.underline} -- [and
the]{.underline} **[fear]{.underline}**, **[anger]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[hatred]{.underline}** [this generates between
different]{.underline} **[political, religious or ethnic
factions]{.underline}**,"

"However, **[by securing the food supply]{.underline}** through advanced
methods such as regenerative farming, aquaculture and urban food
production, **[we can ease the tensions]{.underline}** [that lead to
war]{.underline}. **[Food]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} now [our most
powerful]{.underline} '**[weapon of peace']{.underline}**."

I cite the case of **[South Asia]{.underline}**, [where]{.underline} a
rapidly emerging [scarcity]{.underline} of fresh water, combined with
land losses and climate instability [are exacerbating the risk of
conflict between]{.underline} the **[nuclear-armed states]{.underline}**
of India and Pakistan.

"**[Even a small nuclear war]{.underline}**, involving 100 or so
weapons, **[could wreak havoc]{.underline}** [with food
supplies]{.underline} worldwide. Scientific models show that [the smoke
and dust emitted would **drive down world temperatures**]{.underline} by
1-2 degrees causing harvest failures round the globe for 10-20 years.
[This could temporarily halve food availability]{.underline} worldwide
right when humanity is attempting to double it."

[Emerging]{.underline} water [scarcity]{.underline} on the North China
Plain, the heartland of the country's wheat production, [could
drive]{.underline} **[China to outsource]{.underline}** far more of its
**[food]{.underline}** from overseas, especially from Africa, Asia and
Australasia. In some cases, [the need to feed China may thus conflict
with the need to feed local people]{.underline}.

The Middle East and North African (**[MENA]{.underline}**) region [faces
one of the world's worst]{.underline} water [crises]{.underline}, [with
its rich countries]{.underline} -- where population is redoubling --
also [attempting to feed themselves by taking up farmland in Africa and
elsewhere]{.underline}, [adding to]{.underline} local **[instability. A
major food]{.underline}**, land and water **[crisis in North
Africa]{.underline}**, driven by hunger in the sub-Saharan region and
foreign food exports, [could have consequences for]{.underline} southern
**[Europe]{.underline}** [and the stability of the entire European
Community many times **larger than the Syrian conflict**]{.underline},
the book warns.

Many [countries across Africa remain on a knife-edge over
food]{.underline}, land and water security, compounded by climate
impacts and desertification. [This has]{.underline} already [manifested
in more than a dozen **food-related conflicts**]{.underline} in recent
decades, Food or War documents.

**[Central Asia]{.underline}** [is another region where rising
population is combining with dwindling]{.underline} water
[availability]{.underline} and land degradation [to increase
the]{.underline} **[risk of conflict.]{.underline}**

"The good news is that [all of these conflicts can be
averted]{.underline}, by the world investing a small part of its \$1.8
trillion armaments budget in novel food systems that are climate-proof
and are less dependent on soil, water, artificial fertilisers or
pesticides.

"[That would make food the world's greatest 'weapon of peace' in the
21st Century]{.underline}. We need to recognise that the [old paradigms
of food production]{.underline} and defence which applied in the 20th
Century [will not succeed in the 21st]{.underline}. We need a food
revolution capable of meeting the new challenges of our age.

Food or War describes a food system capable of feeding, reliably,
healthily and peaceably, a global population of ten billion on a hot,
resource depleted Planet.\
Comments Emeritus Professor Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University: "Anyone
with an interest in either the human future or in food should read this
clear, authoritative, scary book. So should all first-year College
classes."

Adds Canadian ecologist Dr David Suzuki "This book is an urgent call for
recognition that the inescapable need for change also brings enormous
opportunities."

"This thoughtful plan to deal with an **[impending global food security
disaster]{.underline}** [deserves]{.underline} coordinated and [urgent
consideration]{.underline} by the UN FAO and all national governments,"
says Major General Michael Jeffery, a former Governor-General of
Australia.

**Food shortages make [nuclear war]{.underline} inevitable in
[every]{.underline} region.**

[Climbing]{.underline} world **[temperatures]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} rising **[sea levels]{.underline}** [will
diminish]{.underline} the supply of **[food]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[water]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} many
[**resource-deprived areas**, increasing the risk of widespread
**starvation**, social]{.underline} [**unrest**, and]{.underline}
[**human flight**. Global]{.underline} **[corn
production]{.underline}**, for example, [is projected to fall
by]{.underline} as much as **[14 percent]{.underline}** in a 2°C warmer
world, according to research cited in a 2018 special report by the UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). **[Food
scarcity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[crop
failures]{.underline}** risk **[pushing hundreds of
millions]{.underline}** [of people into]{.underline} [**overcrowded
cities**, where]{.underline} the likelihood of [**pandemics**,
ethnic]{.underline} [**strife**, and]{.underline} severe **[storm
damage]{.underline}** [is bound to increase. All]{.underline} of this
[will impose an immense burden on human institutions]{.underline}. Some
**[states may collapse]{.underline}** or break up [into a **collection
of warring chiefdoms**]{.underline}---all [fighting over sources of
water and other vital resources]{.underline}.

[A]{.underline} **[similar momentum]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} now
[evident in the]{.underline} emerging [**nuclear arms race**,
with]{.underline} all three major powers---**[China, Russia, and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates---[rushing to deploy
a]{.underline} **[host of new munitions]{.underline}**. This dangerous
process commenced a decade ago, when Russian and Chinese leaders sought
improvements to their nuclear arsenals and President Barack Obama, in
order to secure Senate approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty of 2010, agreed to initial funding for the modernization of all
three legs of America's strategic triad, which encompasses submarines,
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and bombers. (New START, which
mandated significant reductions in US and Russian arsenals, will expire
in February 2021 unless renewed by the two countries.) Although Obama
initiated the modernization of the nuclear triad, the Trump
administration has sought funds to proceed with their full-scale
production, at an estimated initial installment of \$500 billion over 10
years.

Even during the initial modernization program of the Obama era, Russian
and Chinese leaders were sufficiently alarmed to hasten their own
nuclear acquisitions. Both countries were already in the process of
modernizing their stockpiles---Russia to replace Cold War--era systems
that had become unreliable, China to provide its relatively small
arsenal with enhanced capabilities. Trump's decision to acquire a whole
new suite of ICBMs, nuclear-armed submarines, and bombers has added
momentum to these efforts. And with all three major powers upgrading
their arsenals, the other nuclear-weapon states---led by India,
Pakistan, and North Korea---have been expanding their stockpiles as
well. Moreover, with Trump's recent decision to abandon the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, all major powers are
developing missile delivery systems for a regional **[nuclear
war]{.underline}** such as [might erupt in **Europe**, **South Asia**,
or the]{.underline} **[western Pacific]{.underline}**.

### Rare Earth Minerals 

#### Satellites key to identify REMs---Antarctic proves 

**British Antarctic Survey, 2015** (D.A. Neave, M. Black, T.R. Riley,
S.A. Gibson, G. Ferrier, F. Wall, S. Broom-Fendley. On The Feasibility
Of Imaging Carbonatite-Hosted Rare Earth Element Deposits Using Remote
Sensing. Economic Geology Doi, xx-xx-xxxx, \"Detecting rare earth
elements with remote sensing\", British Antarctic Survey,
<https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/detecting-rare-earth-elements-with-remote-sensing/>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

**[Rare earth elements]{.underline}** (REEs) are a group of naturally
occurring, chemically similar elements present in the Earth's crust.
Over the past decades these elements **[have become increasingly
critical to many modern technologies]{.underline}**, from magnets to
mobile phones. However, **[these elements are typically very sparsely
concentrated within minerals in the Earth's crust, and new techniques
are required to find them. By developing new remote sensing techniques
to detect these important elements we also improve our ability to
remotely map, understand and protect]{.underline}** the Antarctic
continent.

Many rare earth elements (REEs) have unique spectral properties at
visible and near infrared wavelengths (VNIR: 400−1400 nm) that make them
directly detectable with reflectance spectroscopy. Previous studies have
indicated that neodymium (Nd) has the most diagnostic spectral features
of the REEs. Although various studies have demonstrated that REE-bearing
igneous complexes can be mapped using remote sensing techniques, current
satellite-based multispectral instruments have rarely been able to
resolve the narrow absorption features associated with REEs because of
their coarse spectral resolutions. However, **[the improved spectral
resolution in planned hyperspectral instruments, such as EnMAP, may
enable REEs to be detected directly from satellite-based platforms in
future.]{.underline}**

In order to ground truth future remote sensing datasets, we have
acquired spectral reflectance data from a range of
petrologically-characterised REE-rich samples that contain the following
REE-rich phases: monazite-(Ce), bastnäsite-(Ce), parisite-(Ce),
synchysite-(Ce), ancylite-(Ce), eudialyte and pyrochlore. Our findings
confirm the presence of strong Nd3+ absorbance features in the VNIR
reflectance spectra of REE-rich rocks from locations including Bayan
Obo, China; Mountain Pass, USA; Kangankunde, Malawi; and Qeqertaasaq,
Greenland. Resampling (i.e convolving) our laboratory spectra to the
spectral response functions (SRFs) of a range of remote sensing
instruments shows that **[while REEs cannot be detected by multispectral
instruments, REEs absorptions can be resolved by both aircraft- and
satellite-based hyperspectral platforms at realistically achievable
signal-to-noise ratios]{.underline}**. Challenges facing REE detection
by remote sensing are thus dominantly geological rather than
instrumental in nature, i.e relate to deposit size, lithological
heterogeneity and style of outcropping.

#### Scaling up the supply of REMs is critical to the energy transition---the global shift to renewable energy is only possible with a massive increase in supply---that's key to check warming 

**Cho, 2023** (RenéE Cho, 4-5-2023, \"The Energy Transition Will Need
More Rare Earth Elements. Can We Secure Them Sustainably?\", State of
the Planet,
<https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/04/05/the-energy-transition-will-need-more-rare-earth-elements-can-we-secure-them-sustainably/>,
DoA 6/10/2025, DVOG)

**[To limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C or close to
it, all countries must decarbonize---cut fossil fuel use, transition to
zero-carbon renewable energy sources, and electrify as many sectors as
possible. It will require huge numbers of]{.underline}** wind turbines,
solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and storage batteries --- all of
which are made with **[rare earth elements and critical
metals.]{.underline}**

The elements critical to the energy transition include the 17 rare earth
elements, the 15 lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium. While many rare
earth metals are actually common, they are called "rare" because they
are seldom found in sufficient amounts to be extracted easily or
economically.

**[Elements such as silicon, cobalt, lithium, and manganese are not rare
earth elements, but are critical minerals that are also essential for
the energy transition.]{.underline}**

**[Supplying these vast quantities of minerals in a sustainable manner
will be a significant challenge]{.underline}**, but scientists are
exploring a variety of ways to provide materials for the energy
transition with less harm to people and the planet.

Demand is growing

**[The demand for rare earth elements is expected to grow 400-600
percent over the next few decades, and the need for minerals such as
lithium and graphite used in EV batteries could increase as much as
4,000 percent]{.underline}**. Most wind turbines use
neodymium--iron--boron magnets, which contain the rare earth elements
neodymium and praseodymium to strengthen them, and dysprosium and
terbium to make them resistant to demagnetization. Global demand for
neodymium is expected to grow 48 percent by 2050, exceeding the
projected supply by 250 percent by 2030. The need for praseodymium could
exceed supply by 175 percent. Terbium demand is also expected to exceed
supply. And to meet the anticipated demand by 2035 for graphite,
lithium, nickel, and cobalt, one analysis projected that 384 new mines
would be needed.

**[China once supplied 97 percent of the world's rare earth elements.
Government support, cheap labor, lax environmental regulations, and low
prices enabled it to monopolize rare earth metal production. Today China
produces 60-70 percent of the world's rare earth elements and is also
securing mining rights in Africa]{.underline}**. The U.S. produces a
little over 14 percent and Australia produces six percent of rare earth
elements.

**[In 2018, the U.S. was 100 percent dependent on other countries for 21
critical minerals. After China halted exports of rare earth elements to
Japan in a dispute, many countries became concerned about the political
and economic implications of depending on one market and began
developing their own rare earth element production.]{.underline}** The
Biden administration has prioritized the development of a domestic
supply chain for rare earth metals and critical minerals.

### Warming Impact

#### Global warming outweighs all other impacts and causes extinction

**Torres 16** (Phil Torres, PhD candidate @ Rice University in tropical
conservation biology, affiliate scholar @ Institute for Ethics and
Emerging Technologies, July 22, 2016. "Op-ed: Climate Change Is the Most
Urgent Existential Risk".
<http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/Torres20160807>)

[Humanity faces a number of formidable challenges]{.underline} this
century. [Threats]{.underline} to our collective survival [stem
from]{.underline} [asteroids]{.underline} and comets, supervolcanoes,
global [pandemics]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline},
biodiversity loss, [nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[biotechnology]{.underline}, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and
artificial superintelligence. With such threats in mind, an informal
survey conducted by the Future of Humanity Institute placed the
probability of human extinction this century at 19%. To put this in
perspective, it means that the average American is more than a thousand
times more likely to die in a human extinction event than a plane
crash.\* So, given limited resources, which risks should we prioritize?
Many intellectual leaders, including Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and
Bill Gates, have suggested that artificial superintelligence constitutes
one of the most significant risks to humanity. And this may be correct
in the long-term. But I would argue that two other risks, namely
**[climate change]{.underline}** and biodiveristy [loss]{.underline},
[should **take priority**]{.underline} right now [over]{.underline}
**[every other known threat]{.underline}**. Why? [Because these ongoing
catastrophes]{.underline} **[in slow-motion]{.underline}** [will frame
our **existential predicament**]{.underline} on Earth not just for the
rest of this century, but [for]{.underline} literally **[thousands of
years]{.underline}** to come. As such, [they]{.underline} [have the
capacity to **raise or lower** the **probability of other risks
scenarios**]{.underline} [unfolding]{.underline}. Multiplying Threats
Ask yourself the following: [are wars more or less likely in a world
marked by **extreme weather events**]{.underline},
**[megadroughts]{.underline}**, **[food supply
disruptions]{.underline}**, and sea-level rise? [Are terrorist
attacks]{.underline} [more or less likely in a world beset]{.underline}
by **[the collapse of global ecosystems]{.underline}**, **[agricultural
failures]{.underline}**, **[economic uncertainty]{.underline}**, and
political instability? Both [government officials and scientists
agree]{.underline} that the answer is **["more likely."]{.underline}**
For example, the current Director of the CIA, John
[Brennan]{.underline}, recently [identified]{.underline} "the impact of
[climate change]{.underline}" [as one of the "deeper causes of this
rising instability"]{.underline} [in]{.underline} countries like
**[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Iraq]{.underline}**,
**[Yemen]{.underline}**, **[Libya]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. Similarly, the former Secretary of Defense,
Chuck [Hagel]{.underline}, has [described climate change as a **"threat
multiplier"**]{.underline} with "the potential to exacerbate many of the
challenges we are dealing with today --- from infectious disease to
terrorism." The Department of Defense has also affirmed a connection. In
a 2015 report, it states, "Global [climate change will
aggravate]{.underline} problems such as **[poverty]{.underline}**,
**[social tensions]{.underline}**, environmental degradation,
**[ineffectual leadership]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[weak
political institutions]{.underline}** [that threaten
stability]{.underline} in a number of countries." Scientific studies
have further shown a connection between the environmental crisis and
violent conflicts. For example, a 2015 paper in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences argues that climate change was a causal
factor behind the record-breaking 2007-2010 drought in Syria. This
drought led to a mass migration of farmers into urban centers, which
fueled the 2011 Syrian civil war. Some observers, including myself, have
suggested that this struggle could be the beginning of World War III,
given the complex tangle of international involvement and overlapping
interests. The study's conclusion is also significant because the Syrian
civil war was the Petri dish in which the Islamic State consolidated its
forces, later emerging as the largest and most powerful terrorist
organization in human history. A Perfect Storm The point is that
[climate change]{.underline} and biodiversity loss [could very easily
push societies **to the brink of collapse**]{.underline}. [This will
exacerbate **existing geopolitical tensions** and introduce
entirely]{.underline} **[new power struggles]{.underline}** between
state and nonstate actors. At the same time, advanced technologies will
very likely become increasingly powerful and accessible. As I've written
elsewhere, the malicious agents of the future will have bulldozers
rather than shovels to dig mass graves for their enemies. The result is
a perfect storm of more conflicts in the world along with
unprecedentedly dangerous weapons. If the conversation were to end here,
we'd have ample reason for placing climate change and biodiversity loss
at the top of our priority lists. But there are other reasons they ought
to be considered urgent threats. I would argue that they could make
humanity more vulnerable to a catastrophe involving superintelligence
and even asteroids. The basic reasoning is the same for both cases.
Consider superintelligence first. Programming a superintelligence whose
values align with ours is a formidable task even in stable
circumstances. As Nick Bostrom argues in his 2014 book, we should
recognize the "default outcome" of superintelligence to be "doom." Now
imagine trying to solve these problems amidst a rising tide of
interstate wars, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, and other tragedies?
The societal stress caused by climate change and biodiversity loss will
almost certainly compromise important conditions for creating friendly
AI, such as sufficient funding, academic programs to train new
scientists, conferences on AI, peer-reviewed journal publications, and
communication/collaboration between experts of different fields, such as
computer science and ethics. It could even make an "AI arms race" more
likely, thereby raising the probability of a malevolent
superintelligence being created either on purpose or by mistake.
Similarly, [imagine]{.underline} that astronomers discover
[a]{.underline} behemoth asteroid [barreling toward]{.underline} Earth.
Will designing, building, and launching a spacecraft to divert the
assassin past our planet be easier or more difficult in a world
preoccupied with other survival issues? [In a relatively peaceful
world,]{.underline} [one could imagine an asteroid]{.underline} actually
[bringing humanity together]{.underline} [by directing our attention
**toward a common threat**.]{.underline} **[But]{.underline}** if [the
"conflict multipliers" of climate change]{.underline} and biodiversity
loss [have already **catapulted civilization**]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} chaos [and]{.underline} turmoil, I strongly suspect
that [humanity will become]{.underline} [more]{.underline}, rather than
less, [susceptible to danger]{.underline}s of this sort. Context Risks
We can describe the dual threats of climate change and biodiversity loss
as "context risks." Neither is likely to directly cause the extinction
of our species. But **[both will define the context in which
civilization confronts all the other threats]{.underline}** before us.
In this way, [they could **indirectly** contribute to the **overall
danger of annihilation**]{.underline} --- and this worrisome effect
could be significant. For example, according to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the effects of climate change will be "severe,"
"pervasive," and "irreversible." Or, as a 2016 study published in Nature
and authored by over twenty scientists puts it, the consequences of
climate change "will extend longer than the entire history of human
civilization thus far." Furthermore, a recent article in Science
Advances confirms that humanity has already escorted the biosphere into
the sixth mass extinction event in life's 3.8 billion year history on
Earth. Yet [another study suggests]{.underline} that [we could be
approaching a **sudden**,]{.underline} **[irreversible]{.underline}**,
catastrophic **[collapse of the global ecosystem]{.underline}**. If this
were to occur, it could result in "widespread social unrest, economic
instability and loss of human life." [Given the potential for
environmental degradation to **elevate the likelihood of nuclear
wars**]{.underline}, **[nuclear terrorism]{.underline}**, **[engineered
pandemics]{.underline}**, a **[superintelligence
takeover]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} perhaps even **[an impact
winter]{.underline}**, [it ought to take precedence **over all other
risk concerns**]{.underline} --- at least in the near-term. Let's make
sure we get our priorities straight.

#### Climate catastrophes supercharge every other impact and will be inevitable without US-Chinese cooperation

Andrew **Holland**, July 12, 20**19**, is the American Security
Project's Chief Operating Officer. His area of research is on on energy,
climate change, trade, and infrastructure policy. For more than 15
years, he has worked at the center of debates about how to achieve
sustainable energy security and how to effectively address climate
change, KMR,
<https://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-us-and-china-must-find-a-way-to-work-together/>

**[The most important bilateral relationship for the next president will
be with China]{.underline}**. It is no exaggeration to say that
**[decisions made in 2021--2025 will determine whether the rest of the
century is one of peace and prosperity, or one of conflict and
competition.]{.underline}** This relationship goes far beyond the
military or economic competition that you hear about in Washington. The
disturbing trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions means that
**[every person on earth will be impacted by decisions made in
Washington and in Beijing.]{.underline}** In Washington, it appears the
China Hawks have forged a bipartisan consensus in favor of confronting
Beijing. Certainly, some Chinese actions have deserved confrontation.
Chinese military investments directly threaten regional stability and
have drawn confrontation with the US Navy. Chinese cyber capabilities
have advanced from industrial espionage to more dangerous threats to
American military capacity. Chinese technological investments have
deliberately targeted next-generation technologies like Artificial
Intelligence. Chinese economic policy has deliberately favored domestic
"national champions" while stealing from American competitors. These are
all **[reasons to confront China as it rises.]{.underline}** And
previous Administrations should have done more to confront Chinese
abuses of the global trading system, intellectual property rights, and
military expansionism. **[But, the next President must not let
confrontation on these issues undermine efforts to work with the Chinese
on other important issues. Perhaps the most important issue --- one we
no longer have the luxury of waiting for --- is climate
change.]{.underline}** For the sake of the planet, the next President
will have to find a way to work with China. **[Put together, the US and
China make up 42% of global greenhouse emissions]{.underline}**. And
that is growing. **[Without action by both countries to reduce their own
emissions, the world is locked into over 2 degrees C of warming- blowing
past the limits set in the Paris Agreement]{.underline}**. If the two
leading emitters are unwilling to reduce their emissions, why would the
rest of the world? American and Chinese climate policies rebound far
beyond their borders. China's Belt and Road Initiative will build
infrastructure, power plants, and transport links around the world. Will
these Chinese investments lock in clean, green growth, or will the Belt
and Road simply be a way for China to export its dirty coal and
pollution heavy growth model? Right now, it's unclear. President Xi
Jinping has made an effort to tout "open, green, and clean growth" at
**[Belt and Road]{.underline}** summits, but **[policies on the ground
show investments in coal power and heavy industry.]{.underline}** In the
US, it is no exaggeration to say that the Trump Administration has been
a disaster for the climate. By rolling back Obama-era power plant and
fuel economy regulations, they have renewed hope for coal power and gas
guzzlers. Fortunately, markets and state level regulations have limited
the damage so far. New coal power remains uneconomical, and the
electricity grid is getting clearer. As a result, though, US emissions
have reversed a decade- long downwards trend and ticked up by 3.4% in
2018. Perhaps the most damage, though, that Trump will do is outside
America's borders. His "Energy Dominance" agenda has increased fossil
fuel exports, particularly oil and gas, around the world. So far, his
Administration's sabotage has not yet derailed the UN climate
negotiations, and may even have strengthened the Paris Agreement among
other nations. But another 4 years would certainly undermine the global
effort to reduce greenhouse gases. Let's be clear about the stakes.
**[Failure by the United States and China to curb their emissions will
lead to]{.underline}** a world that breaks through the 2 degree
threshold determined in Paris. **[That's a world where seas could rise
by 9 feet or more, inundating coastal mega cities from Shanghai to New
York. A world where once fertile bread baskets like the North China
Plain or California's Imperial Valley are wracked by droughts and
extreme weather, threatening food security. A world where conflicts in
unstable countries could spread into regional crises, unleashing
unprecedented refugee flows]{.underline}**. Neither country wants such a
future; that's why **[the US and China must work together to avert such
a future.]{.underline}** When I see Democrats in Presidential debates
supporting President Trump's aggressive posture against China, I worry
that they don't know the stakes. **[We must not allow misguided notions
of competition to blind us to the need to work together.]{.underline}**
In future articles, we will explore how to work together on technology,
deployment, and global aid.

#### AT Adaptation Solves: Successful adaptation to climate change depends on accurate climate modelling

Why we need good models for adaptation work

When it comes to adaptation, we are already making decisions about
building and rebuilding, agriculture, and ecosystems. The decisions we
make today will be implemented and expected to function in the climate
30 to 50 years from now. That future climate will be warmer and, short
of emission-eliminating interventions to reduce carbon dioxide and
methane emissions, still warming.

Since the 1970s, climate models have evolved to contain enormous
complexity and require the use of the largest computers. The models were
used, first, to probe processes important to the essential physics of
Earth's climate, and a primary goal was understanding how these systems
work. As model complexity has increased, development decisions are often
guided by the design of CMIP to support assessments of our past and
current climate and what to anticipate in the next 100 years. The
100-year outlooks explore scenarios of different policy interventions
and economic development.

The use of CMIP simulations in adaptation planning is a repurposing of
the original goals. Therefore, an evaluation of fit for purpose is the
correct first step in adaptation applications.

By focusing on climate adaptation in the North American Great Lakes
region as a use case, we reveal three classes of shortcomings in the
available simulations. The first is logistical. Though widely and freely
available, the sheer complexity of dealing with the archive can be
overwhelming.

The second comes from an evaluation of the simulations by comparison
with observations. Substantial errors are present, often represented by
biases. Though bias adjustments to fit the simulations to observations
are possible, such adjustments are likely to contribute to
overstatements about how certain we are about particular outcomes.

From a feature-based perspective, model evaluation shows that weather
phenomena are represented with widely varying fidelity. For example,
winter cyclones are better represented than summer convective systems.
Since weather is one of the ways we feel the climate, representation of
weather features is important to adaptation. Local officials are often
motivated to think about adaptation due to weather-related catastrophes
and vulnerabilities.

The third class is structural. This is easy to see if you zoom in on the
Great Lakes region. Do the models represent the lakes and if they do,
how do they represent the lake's behaviors? For example, does the model
include the ability to form and melt lake ice?

In the paper, "Large lakes in climate models: A Great Lakes case study
on the usability of CMIP5," a multiyear process to determine the
presence or absence of the Great Lakes is detailed. This paper found
that most of the models do not include lakes in a way that captures
their impact on regional climate. At a time of rapid warming and urgency
for adaptation decisions, a multiyear exercise that reveals such
fundamental gaps compels us to search for new strategies to provide
model guidance for adaptation.

I bring a couple of these issues together. The representation of lakes
in current climate models might be adequate to describe their small
effects on the world's climate system. However, if lake effect
precipitation and how it changes is not represented, it does little good
for a professional working on an adaptation problem in Buffalo, New
York. Models that can't account for lake effect snow won't win any
credibility contests with the city's mayor.

Similarly, we have a good sense of where temperature is headed in the
Great Lakes region. We have defensible guidance on increasing
variability of precipitation. The simulations tell us that storm sewer
pipes will need to be to accommodate increasingly intense downpours. But
the size of those pipes and *when* they are needed remains highly
uncertain.

For problems such as the rise and fall of lake levels, which depend on
the accumulated effects of precipitation, evaporation, and runoff. When
precipitation, evaporation, and runoff are combined over the seasonal
and annual time spans necessary to calculate lake water budgets, the
bias errors also accumulate and exceed 100% in each part of the budget
calculation. Such biases are indefensible for decision-making and
require expert guidance to interpret and describe the uncertainties.

There's a similar story playing out in the Southeast, where coastal
cities are working to adapt to rising seas and more severe hurricanes.
Detailed representation of our coastline and coastal processes is not
essential in a global climate model. However, they are at the core of
making decisions about coastal defenses, and how long the coasts can be
defended. 

High-resolution regional models offer a tool to address some of the
issues of locality that must be addressed. However, regional models rely
on global models to be of high quality to define the boundaries of the
region to be simulated. Regional models inherit not only the global
model's description of climate parameters but also the global model's
systematic errors.

We can identify many cases of flood, drought, fire, and water resources
for which we need to be making decisions to improve our environmental
security. They require knowledge about both the instantaneous
consequences of severe weather and the accumulated effects of heat,
water scarcity, and water abundance. Given how fast the climate is
warming and the severity of problems we face, taking years to establish
that models are or are not fit for purpose is unsatisfying and
unacceptable. 

### AT: Climate Tipping Point already reached

#### Tipping point isn't a reason to give up---it means that climate impacts are linear and we can make meaningful improvements with even minor shifts 

**Lindwall, 2022** (Courtney Lindwall, National Resource Defense Center
contributor, 11-15-2022, \"Climate Tipping Points Are Closer Than Once
Thought\", No Publication,
<https://www.nrdc.org/stories/climate-tipping-points-are-closer-once-thought>,
DoA 9/2/2024, DVOG)

**[We often think of global warming as being linear: Emit too much
carbon and the planet's thermostat goes up
proportionally]{.underline}**. And, while this is generally true, the
resulting **[climate consequences---like severe drought---don't
necessarily follow that track]{.underline}**. In other words, **[10
percent more CO2 doesn\'t just equal 10 percent more
impact]{.underline}**.

The more complex reality is that the **[cumulative effects of continued
greenhouse gas emissions could potentially trigger what scientists refer
to as climate tipping points. These are critical thresholds that, once
crossed, tip a natural system into an entirely different state and lead
to potentially irreversible, catastrophic impacts]{.underline}** for the
planet---including more warming.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (**[IPCC) notes that more
than a dozen natural systems---from ice sheets to the Amazon
rainforest---are at risk of "tipping." And although the actual tipping
process could take years or even many centuries, it's possible that once
a threshold is passed, the shift is, essentially, a done
deal]{.underline}**---even if emissions are halted or reversed. In the
case of the Amazon rainforest, for example, hitting a climate tipping
point, particularly in the face of continued deforestation, could
eventually turn the tropical forest into an arid savannah. "Whether it's
a vast carbon store---like the Amazon or the boreal---or other critical
natural systems, **[we must work to keep them as resilient as possible
to a changing climate]{.underline}**," says Jennifer Skene, natural
climate solutions policy manager at NRDC. "Their protection should be
the focus at the local, national, and international level."

**[This approach rings essential in the face of a growing body of
evidence that suggests we're much closer to these planetary points of no
return than once thought]{.underline}**. Here's what that means.

Why are scientists increasingly concerned about climate tipping points?

There are still many unknowns, but improved climate modeling and new
observations create a clearer picture than we've had before. Most
recently, **[a 2022 study published in Science concluded that we may
have already crossed some tipping point thresholds with the 1.1 degrees
Celsius of global warming that humans have caused so far. More will
become likely if we surpass the 1.5-degree threshold. That's a
significant update to a prior assessment, which suggested we would need
to hit 2 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius before reaching this state.

Even the latest IPCC report, which has historically taken a more
cautious view, warns that **[certain global tipping points could be
triggered by emissions trajectories currently predicted as "very
likely." And the warmer it gets, the more probable triggering these
tipping points becomes.]{.underline}**

Can anything actually be done to avoid tipping points?

**[Some impacts may now be inevitable, but we can still take steps to
avoid further accelerating the consequences of the tipping points we
have likely passed or will pass. That's why it's crucial we prioritize
and ramp up climate mitigation and climate adaptation.]{.underline}**

**[On the mitigation front, it means doing all we can to limit global
warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, which will require
transformative global shifts led by the developed countries responsible
for the majority of historical emissions]{.underline}**. On the
adaptation front, that means actively preparing for climate impacts
coming down the pike and prioritizing resources for already-vulnerable
communities.

The bottom line? **[We can still hasten positive change, like the use of
renewables,]{.underline}** which have already crossed a "mass adoption"
threshold in 87 countries. **[So tipping points should only drive us to
press for greater action---not to throw our hands up.]{.underline}**

#### Current trajectory isn't enough---change is necessary to keep us below 2 degrees---catastrophic impacts at 3 degrees and above

**Armstrong McKay, et al, 2022** (David I, Stockholm Research Center, et
al, 9-9-2022, \"Exceeding 1.5°C global warming could trigger multiple
climate tipping points\", Science,
<https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950>, DoA 9/2/2024,
DVOG)

**[This revised assessment of CTPs has significant implications for
climate policy by determining levels of global warming that prevent
tipping]{.underline}** to either committed changes in Earth system
function or major damage to future societies. **[A risk minimization
approach such as this seeks to avoid minimum estimated
thresholds]{.underline}** but this no longer appears possible for some
tipping elements.

**[Current warming is \~1.1°C above preindustrial and even with rapid
emission cuts warming will reach \~1.5°C by the 2030s]{.underline}**
([*23*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R23)).
We cannot rule out that WAIS and GrIS tipping points have already been
passed (see above) and several other tipping elements have minimum
threshold values within the 1.1 to 1.5°C range. Our best estimate
thresholds for GrIS, WAIS, REEF, and abrupt permafrost thaw (PFAT) are
\~1.5°C although WAIS and GrIS collapse may still be avoidable if GMST
returns below 1.5°C within an uncertain overshoot time (likely decades)
([*94*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R94)).
Setting aside achievability (and recognizing internal climate
variability of \~±0.1°C), this suggests that \~1°C is a level of global
warming that minimizes the likelihood of crossing CTPs. This is
consistent with the \<0.5 to 1°C range of Holocene temperature
variability whereas past interglacials ≤1.5 to 2°C had up to 10 to 13 m
higher sea level
([*21*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R21), [*95*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R95)).

**[The chance of triggering CTPs is already non-negligible and will grow
even with stringent climate mitigation]{.underline}** (SSP1-1.9 in [Fig.
2, B and C](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#F2)).
Nevertheless, achieving the Paris Agreement's aim to pursue efforts to
limit warming to 1.5°C would clearly be safer than keeping global
warming below 2°C
([*90*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R90))
([Fig. 2](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#F2)).
**[Going from 1.5 to 2°C increases the likelihood of committing to WAIS
and GrIS collapse, near complete warm-water coral die-off, and abrupt
permafrost thaw; further, the best estimate threshold for LABC collapse
is crossed. The likelihood of triggering AMOC collapse, Boreal forest
shifts, and extra-polar glacier loss becomes non-negligible at \>1.5°C
and glacier loss becomes likely by \~2°C. A cluster of abrupt shifts
occur in ESMs at 1.5 to 2°C]{.underline}**
([*19*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R19)).
Although not tipping elements, ASSI loss could become regular by 2°C,
gradual permafrost thaw would likely become widespread beyond 1.5°C, and
land carbon sink weakening would become significant by 2°C.

**[Recent net zero targets if implemented could limit peak warming to
\~1.95°C]{.underline}** (1.3 to 3°C), but as of November 2021 current
policies are estimated to result in \~2.6 °C (1.9 °C to 3.7 °C) by 2100
([*96*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R96)).
Therefore 2 to 3°C by 2100 is currently likely with matching of pledges
with policies key to determining where warming ends up in this range.
**[Going from 2 to 3°C, maximum estimated thresholds for abrupt
permafrost thaw, GrIS, WAIS, and extra-polar glaciers are passed,
suggesting that tipping them would become very likely. The likelihood of
triggering EASB collapse, Amazon dieback, and West African monsoon
shift]{.underline}** (Sahel greening) **[becomes non-negligible at \~2°C
and increases at \~3°C. Subpolar gyre collapse, boreal forest dieback,
and AMOC collapse also become more likely. Although not tipping
elements, above 2°C the Arctic would very likely become summer
ice--free]{.underline}** and land carbon sink-to-source transitions
would become widespread.

If the moderate ambition of current policies is not improved and climate
sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be higher than the
median assumption then warming of up to \~4°C is possible by 2100, and
\>4°C cannot be ruled out if future policy ambition declines and/or
implementation falters. **[Going from 3 to 5°C, EASB collapse becomes
very likely, Amazon dieback becomes likely \>3.5°C, boreal forest shifts
likely \>4°C, and large-scale permafrost collapse becomes possible at
\>3°C and likely \>4°C]{.underline}**. AMOC collapse may become likely
\>4°C but with high uncertainty (1.4 to 8°C range) and AWSI collapse
becomes possible \>4.5°C. Warming of \>5°C, although very unlikely this
century, becomes plausible in the longer-term under higher climate
sensitivities with current or reversed policies. This risks EAIS
collapse and a commitment of \~55 m of sea level rise if warming
stabilizes \>5°C for multiple centuries. Other tipping elements, if not
already triggered---e.g., Amazon dieback, widespread Permafrost
collapse---would very likely be committed and AMOC collapse and AWSI
collapse would become increasingly likely. **[Equatorial stratocumulus
cloud breakup occurs in one model beyond \~6°C
(]{.underline}[*97*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R97)[)
and if plausible would represent a global CTP to a "hothouse" climate
state]{.underline}**
([*3*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#core-R3)).

#### Variety of tipping points with massive wide reaching impacts are within reach---now is key time for emissions reductions

Rao, 8/19/2024 (Devika Rao, Staff writer, The Week US, 8/19/2024, \"11
looming climate tipping points that imperil our planet\", theweek,
<https://theweek.com/environment/climate-tipping-points-un-report>, DoA
9/2/2024, DVOG)

**[The world is rapidly approaching the \"brink of multiple risk tipping
points,\"]{.underline}** the United Nations said in its 2023
Interconnected Disaster Risks report. Risk tipping points, the U.N.
said, are \"**[when the systems that we rely on for our lives and
societies cannot buffer risks and stop functioning.\" Throw in
accelerating climate change, and \"the very practical consequence will
be that much more people will live under very precarious conditions ---
so loss of life, loss of livelihood and loss of
opportunities]{.underline}**,\" Zita Sebesvari, one of the lead authors
of the report, said to the Los Angeles Times. \"It does have cascading
impacts.\"

A new report by the University of Exeter Global Systems Institute
specifically pointed to three broad areas where tipping points are
concentrated: the cryosphere, the biosphere and the ocean and
atmosphere. **[The world is soon to meet several tipping points but we
can still \"take decisive actions to avert the worst of these impacts,
and perhaps even forge a new path toward a bright, sustainable and
equitable future]{.underline}**,\" the U.N. report said.

Cryosphere tipping points

Mountain glaciers melting: **[As aquifers empty, the world\'s glaciers
are \"melting at double the speed they had in the past two
decades]{.underline}**,\" the U.N. report said. That increases the
amount of freshwater in the short term --- sometimes too much, causing
flooding --- but \"many of those glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, the
Himalayas and the Andes feed into these rivers and groundwater
systems,\" Caitlyn Eberle, one of the lead authors of the U.N. report,
said to Reuters. \"So **[as those glaciers disappear, there is less
water available]{.underline}**.\" Many glacier-fed areas are rapidly
approaching or have already reached \"peak water,\" the point of maximum
meltwater a glacier produces before its freshwater output steadily
declines. Meltwater is crucial to sustaining certain regions during dry
seasons with low rainfall.

Greenland ice sheet collapsing: **[The Greenland ice sheet is a
staggering 1.71 million square kilometers, only second in size to the
Antarctic ice sheet. The sheet is also losing mass as the climate warms
and \"substantial ice loss is likely irreversible on multi-millennial
timescales]{.underline}**,\" said the University of Exeter report. A
collapsing Greenland ice sheet raises the likelihood of sea-level rising
and coastal flooding.

Antarctic ice sheet melting: A new report found that **[the Antarctic
ice sheet is melting at a more accelerated rate than previously thought.
\"Warm ocean water is seeping beneath the ice sheet at its \'grounding
line\' --- the point at which the ice rises from the seabed and starts
to float --- causing accelerated melting which could lead to a tipping
point]{.underline}**,\" said CNN. **[Even small changes in ocean
temperature can push the sheet to melt further. \"You get this kind of
runaway feedback ... where you can have a very sudden shift in how much
melting is happening in these places,\"]{.underline}** Alex Bradley, the
lead author of the paper, said to CNN. \"Our projections of sea level
rise might be significant underestimates.\"

Biosphere tipping points

Accelerating extinctions: **[Human influence has greatly increased the
rate of extinctions across the world, helping push the planet into its
sixth mass extinction event, with almost a million plant and animal
species currently at risk. Given \"human activities such as land use
change, overexploitation, climate change, pollution and introduction of
invasive species, we have put our foot on the extinction
accelerator,\"]{.underline}** the University of Exeter report said, and
the resulting threat to \"our critical life-support systems is vastly
underestimated.\" The Amazon rainforest as well as other rainforests are
particularly at risk, suffering not only from human influence but also
\"unprecedented climate-driven disturbances such as increasing dry
season length and intensity, more intense and frequent rainfall and
temperature extremes,\" said the report. These extinctions have the
potential to cause ecosystem collapses because species are largely
interconnected. \"We are increasing the risk of co-extinction,\"
Sebesvari said to DW.

Dying coral reefs: **[Coral reefs are largely in danger due to climate
change. Warming oceans are disrupting the delicate aquatic ecosystem
causing bleaching]{.underline}**, which is when \"thermal stress causes
corals to expel the symbiotic algae that provides them with food
(resulting in a characteristic loss of color), and can result in death
if it occurs frequently enough to prevent recovery,\" said the
University of Exeter report. The threat is imminent and \"more than 54
percent of the reef areas in the global ocean are experiencing
bleaching-level heat stress,\" Derek Manzello, the coordinator of Coral
Reef Watch, said to Al Jazeera. **[Coral reefs also hold a quarter of
all marine life on Earth and their collapse could drastically alter the
ecosystem.]{.underline}**

Uninsurable future: The combination of the aforementioned tipping points
means **[more and more places on Earth are becoming uninhabitable ---
and uninsurable. There has been a seven-fold increase in the amount of
damage from natural disasters since the 1970s. Homes and businesses in
disaster-prone areas are starting to see either extremely high insurance
premiums or in some cases, little or no coverage as insurance companies
pull out]{.underline}**. Once home insurance becomes too expensive or
unavailable, \"people are left without an economic safety net when
disasters strike,\" the report said. As the world gets closer to tipping
past these points of no return, \"we also lose some of our tools and
options to deal with future disaster risk,\" Sebesvari said to Forbes.

Groundwater depletion: **[Much of the world\'s drinking water comes from
underground reservoirs called aquifers. The bad news is that these
aquifers are rapidly emptying, with 21 of the 37 largest aquifers losing
water faster than they can be replenished. The water in the aquifers
\"has accumulated over thousands of years, and would equally take
thousands of years to fully recharge,]{.underline}**\" the report said,
so these crucial reservoirs are \"essentially a non-renewable
resource.\" Approximately 2 billion people worldwide rely on groundwater
as a primary source of drinking water, but most groundwater is used in
agriculture. \"We can no longer consider groundwater as a boundless
source of easily accessible freshwater,\" the report said. And its
increasing inaccessibility has \"worrying implications.\"

Ocean and atmospheric tipping points

Unbearable heat: **[This year, the planet has broken numerous heat
records. The warmer temperatures have caused intense heat waves and led
to \"an average of 500,000 excess deaths annually in the last two
decades]{.underline}**,\" the U.N. said. The heat also
disproportionately affects more vulnerable populations. Along with its
toll on humans, heat exacerbates a number of other ecological problems,
including melting glaciers, extreme storms and extinctions. \"**[The
reality is that we are quickly approaching a tipping point past which
people will not survive]{.underline}**,\" the report said. As
temperatures rise even higher, **[the heat\'s impact will get more
extreme and harder to reverse.]{.underline}**

Changing ocean currents: **[The extreme heat has also caused a meteoric
rise in ocean temperatures which can lead to a shift in ocean
currents]{.underline}**. For example, the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may be disrupted in the future because
the \"surface waters in the northern North Atlantic may become less
dense,\" said the University of Exeter report. Cold water is denser than
warm water and the current works through different water temperatures
rising and sinking. \"AMOC may have weakened by around 15\" over the
past 50 years and may be at its weakest in 1,000 years.\" **[The current
is crucial to maintain the climates of western and northern
Europe.]{.underline}**

Ocean deoxygenation: A new study published in the journal Nature Ecology
& Evolution found that \"**[lakes and reservoirs have experienced oxygen
losses of 5.5% and 18.6% respectively in the past 45 years, and the
oceans have dropped by 2%,\"]{.underline}** said Popular Mechanics.
While not previously considered a tipping point, scientists argue that
it should be. **[Deoxygenated water can be detrimental to marine
populations, leading to mass extinctions. It stems from warming
temperatures, along with human factors like fertilizer runoff. \"Failure
to address aquatic deoxygenation will, ultimately, not only affect
ecosystems but also economic activity, and society at a global
level]{.underline}**,\" said the lead author of the study, Kevin Rose,
in a press release.

## AT Russia Relations

#### Turn\--Increased operations key to normalize US presence, checks future tensions 

**Tingstead, Savitz, et al, 2023** (Scott Savitz is a senior engineer at
the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. Abbie Tingstad is an
adjunct senior researcher at RAND, 11-1-2023, \"Arctic Capabilities of
the U.S. Armed Forces\", No Publication,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1638-1.html>, DoA
6/5/2025, DVOG)

Accidental Escalation of Tensions

We have already referred to **[accidental tension escalation in relation
to Russia and China. Better domain awareness and communications are
particularly important]{.underline}** for this issue. Crucially,
**[sending more strategic assets to the Arctic could work at odds with
goals of reducing tensions. Thus, capabilities aimed at gaining
knowledge and communicating and maintaining a presence in support of
safety, security, and stewardship within the Arctic as opposed to global
power projection assets in service of other security needs would be best
to avoid capacity growth becoming an escalation problem unto itself.
Normalizing U.S. federal-level presence, activities, and exercises in
the Arctic region in the service of regional security would also be
preferable for alleviating any risks of accidental escalation rather
than periodic or inconsistent forays into the Far North]{.underline}**,
which could cause undue speculation of the causes or reasons behind it.
Further complicated by the effects of climate change is that the Arctic
is increasingly an environment in which weather conditions can rapidly
change. **[The United States needs to be prepared with sufficient
capabilities and domain awareness to mitigate the impact of these
adverse weather conditions and reduce the risk of an accident with a
Russian or Chinese asset, thereby accidently escalating
tensions.]{.underline}**

Maintaining a persistent presence in support of safety, security, and
stewardship rather than global power projection assets is achievable. It
includes the construction of PSCs and ASCs that can interdict IUU
fishing and illegal smuggling, perform SAR, and conduct vessel safety
and security checks. Under Title 10, USCG vessels can also engage other
military assets. It often does so in cooperative ways, such as through
exercises under the ACGF, Exercise Argus, and Operation NANOOK. It also
includes upgrading existing airfields not only for military traffic but
for civilian traffic, bolstering links between isolated Arctic
communities. It involves collaboration with other members of the Arctic
Council, including Russia, to continue to integrate regional SAR
capabilities to help mitigate the chance of accidental escalation. In
sum, it involves normalizing U.S. presence, activities, and exercises in
the Arctic region as a means of deescalating tensions associated with
that presence.

Perception of U.S. Absence and a Security Void

**[Lack of U.S. day-to-day presence could lead to broader perceptions of
an absentee owner and lead to a security void, inviting more illicit
activity and presence of other countries seeking influence close to U.S.
territory. Again, the primary issue is capacity]{.underline}**, not
capability. The United States can and does demonstrate its presence in
the Arctic, whether through patrols by the USCGC Healy or the
positioning of F-22 Raptor fighter jets to JBER. In 2018, the USS Harry 
S. Truman carrier strike group deployed to the Arctic Circle---and again
recently during Exercise Cold Response in 2022. U.S. Submarine Force
continues to routinely conduct operations in the Arctic region. Other
naval exercises or training include Exercise Ragnar Viking, Exercise
Dynamic Mongoose, Ice Exercise, Exercise Cold Response 2022, and
continued training events between the U.S. Marine Corps and Norway's
forces. Rather, it is an issue of capacity. It needs to demonstrate a
persistent, strong, resilient presence in the panArctic now and
especially into the future as diminishing sea ice promotes maritime
accessibility to deter potentially adversaries from upsetting Arctic
peace, cooperation, and stability, the recent events in Ukraine
notwithstanding. The appropriation and approval of three new PSCs, with
the possibility of additional PSCs and ASCs, would go some way to
maintaining a constant presence in the U.S. Arctic and enhance domain
awareness, reducing both the risk of an adversarial antiaccess operation
and the perception of a U.S. absence and security void in the Arctic.
Training more contiguous United States--based forces in operating in the
severe Arctic climate would also demonstrate the United States'
seriousness in protecting its Arctic interests. Other, **[potentially
less expensive but no less important ways exist for the United States to
demonstrate a persistent and responsible security presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. The construction of a deepwater port at Nome; the
upgrading of Alaskan communities' airstrips into airfields capable of
accepting larger aircraft and thereby increasing connectivity between
isolated, largely Indigenous communities; investment in medical
capabilities in these isolated communities; and upgrading aging
early-warning system units all demonstrate persistent, year-round
presence that is generally nonescalatory in nature.

Lack of Control over Arctic Narratives

**[Having regular access to domain-awareness, communications, and
response capabilities sets the stage for controlling the narrative as
situations arise in the Arctic. DoD, DHS, service component, and other
U.S. Arctic strategies have noted this issue. This is particularly
important as information warfare gains in dominance and disinformation
campaigns are tools regularly used by U.S. rivals.]{.underline}** For
example, if the United States' sole Arctic-assigned icebreaker, the
USCGC Healy, breaks down because of operational or mechanical issues, it
might have to wait days or weeks for an allied or partner icebreaker to
rescue it. Russia could turn a rescue of the Healy by one of its own
40-plus icebreakers into an information competition win that could be
embarrassing for the United States and its interests. China rescuing the
Healy with Xue Long 1 or Xue Long 2 would be even more embarrassing. The
United States has the means to counter adversarial disinformation
campaigns in the U.S. Arctic but needs to employ them. On the civilian
side, this means providing local communities with resilient internet
access and frequency modulation (FM) stations, similar to the national
Arctic network employed by Canada. The United States must possess
control over its Arctic narrative. As DoD, DHS, service component, and
other U.S. Arctic strategies indicate, the United States is an Arctic
country. [All too often, the American public forgets that the United
States is an Arctic country with statutory and tactical responsibilities
to Americans who reside in the region, as well as significant strategic
interests, such as ISR operations, NORAD]{.underline}, and supporting
Indigenous peoples' ways of life, both at the local level and through
such international organizations as the Arctic Council. The United
States can maintain control over its Arctic narrative through the
construction of PSCs and ASCs, enhancing existing Arctic infrastructure,
finding new ways to deepen collaboration with Indigenous communities,
hosting more visits from U.S. naval vessels, and an active public
affairs campaign that highlights U.S. accomplishments and the importance
of continued multilateral cooperation in the Arctic.

Conclusions on Risks

We found that, contrary to the expectations implied in the FY  2021
NDAA, potential risks relate to the United States' ability to sustain
regular operations to meet emerging needs much more than to less ability
to access the Arctic than other countries (especially Russia and China)
have. In other words, whereas the United States can demonstrate presence
in the Arctic, it practices presence in only a narrow array of missions
in which there is historical precedent (e.g., strategic deterrence,
science, fishery management in the Bering Sea). The capabilities,
practices, architectures, and training honed for this limited number of
missions in past decades are not necessarily well aligned to emerging or
future needs and cannot easily be scaled up to meet the full variety of
credible future Arctic demands. This creates risk to national interests
and to the safety of the armed forces charged with protecting those
national interests.

military-relevant space capabilities has not been diminished by the war
in Ukraine. Instead, its incentives to do so may have increased, but the
same can be said for the United States. [Russia's major
**miscalculations**]{.underline} about how well its military would
perform [in **Ukraine**]{.underline}, how Ukrainians would react, and
how the West would respond have presumably [provided a **cautionary
lesson** for **China**]{.underline} that [advances in counter**space**
capabilities and other types of military modernization do **not
guarantee** a low-cost victory even against a **much less capable

continue to improve their military space capabilities at least partially
in response to what the other side is doing, [**Chinese leaders** are

[It is **unlikely**]{.underline} that [**U.S. attempts** to increase
**collaboration**]{.underline} in space [have increased the **risk of
entanglement**]{.underline}. First, [the **U**nited **S**tates has
**not** extended new **security guarantees** to **spacefaring
allies**]{.underline}; rather, [it is enhancing cooperation with
countries that it **previously committed** to defend]{.underline}.
Although some U.S. allies are exploring options for more-intensive space
control policies (such as France's "active defense" concept), [**U.S.
allies** do not **appear** to be pursuing the type of **risk-acceptant
strategies** that would raise concerns of **reckless
driving**]{.underline}.46 And although [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} has indicated that it would respond to attacks
on allied space systems, it [retains **significant flexibility** in
deciding the nature and timing of such a response]{.underline}. The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization has clarified that Article V applies
to space but has left ambiguous what actions might be required if an
ally is attacked in the domain.47 Similarly, unilateral U.S. space
policy guidance states that any "purposeful interference with or an
attack on" allied space systems that "directly affects national rights"
would be met with "a deliberate response" at the United States'
discretion, but U.S. space [policy does not specify the **timing**,
**scale**, or **nature** of such response, including whether it would be
**limited** to the same domain]{.underline}.48 Arguably, the greater
entanglement risk comes for allies and partners than for the United
States because linking their assets with U.S. space systems in support
of U.S. operations increases the likelihood that they would be targeted
as part of a retaliation against the United States.

Still, there is a risk that U.S. adversaries might underestimate U.S.
commitments to its allies and partners and provoke a crisis or conflict
by attacking an ally's space assets. Such a scenario could arise if
adversaries assessed that U.S. allies' capabilities were more vulnerable
to cyber or kinetic attacks, or if they determined that the United
States would respond less forcefully to an action against a non-U.S.
system. In these circumstances, such an attack could be seen as a
relatively low-cost means to probe U.S. escalation thresholds or sow
uncertainty about the credibility of U.S. security commitments. However,
this risk is not unique to the space domain and, instead, reflects
general perceptions of U.S. extended deterrence commitments.
Furthermore, [there is **little** public **ev**idence]{.underline} that
[China or Russia believes that the **U**nited **S**tates would respond
**differently** to an attack on an ally's **space systems**]{.underline}
than it would to an attack on its assets in other domains. To the
contrary, [U.S. attempts to enhance space cooperation]{.underline} with
allies and partners should convey the importance the United States
places on allied and partner systems and [reduce **uncertainty** that
could contribute to a **miscalc**ulation.]{.underline}

**[No debris cascades]{.underline}, but even a [worst case]{.underline}
is confined to [low LEO]{.underline} with [no impact]{.underline}**

Syndrome is Over Hyped", 5/21/2017,

**[Kessler Syndrome is overhyped. A chorus of online commenters great
any news of upcoming low earth orbit satellites with worry that humanity
will to lose access to space]{.underline}**. I now think **[they are
wrong]{.underline}**.

What is Kessler Syndrome?

Here's the popular view on Kessler Syndrome. Every once in a while, a
piece of junk in space hits a satellite. This single impact destroys the
satellite, and breaks off several thousand additional pieces. These new
pieces now fly around space looking for other satellites to hit, and so
exponentially multiply themselves over time, like a nuclear reaction,
until a sphere of man-made debris surrounds the earth, and humanity no
longer has access to space nor the benefits of satellites.

It is a dark picture.

**[Is Kessler Syndrome likely to happen?]{.underline}**

I had to stop everything and spend an afternoon doing back-of-the-napkin
math to know how big the threat is. To estimate, we need to know where
the stuff in space is, how much mass is there, and how long it would
take to deorbit.

**[The orbital area around earth can be broken down into four
regions.]{.underline}**

**[Low LEO - Up to about 400km. Things that orbit here burn up in the
earth's atmosphere quickly - between a few months to two
years]{.underline}**. The space station operates at the high end of this
range. It loses about a kilometer of altitude a month and if not pushed
higher every few months, would soon burn up. **[For all practical
purposes, Low LEO doesn't matter for Kessler Syndrome. If Low LEO was
ever full of space junk, we'd just wait]{.underline}** a year and a
half, **[and the problem would be over]{.underline}**.

**[High LEO - 400km to 2000km. This where most heavy satellites and most
space junk orbits]{.underline}**. The air is thin enough here that
satellites only go down slowly, and they have a much farther distance to
fall. **[It can take 50 years for stuff here to get down. This is where
Kessler Syndrome could be an issue]{.underline}**.

**[Mid Orbit - GPS satellites and other navigation satellites travel
here in lonely, long lives. The volume of space is so huge, and the
number of satellites so few, that we don't need to worry about Kessler
here]{.underline}**.

**[GEO - If you put a satellite far enough out from earth, the speed
that the satellite travels around the earth will match the speed of the
surface of the earth rotating under it]{.underline}**. From the ground,
the satellite will appear to hang motionless. Usually the geostationary
orbit is used by big weather satellites and big TV broadcasting
satellites. (This apparent motionlessness is why satellite TV dishes can
be mounted pointing in a fixed direction. You can find approximate south
just by looking around at the dishes in your northern hemisphere
neighborhood.) For Kessler purposes, **[GEO orbit is roughly a ring
384,400 km around. However, all]{.underline}** the **[satellites here
are moving the same direction at the same speed - debris doesn't get
free velocity]{.underline}** from the speed of the satellites. **[Also,
it's quite expensive to get a satellite here, and so there aren't many,
only about one satellite per 1000km of the ring. Kessler is not a
problem here]{.underline}**.

How bad could Kessler Syndrome in High LEO be?

Let's **[imagine a worst case scenario]{.underline}**.

**[An evil alien]{.underline}** intelligence **[chops up everything in
High LEO, turning it into 1cm cubes of death]{.underline}** orbiting at
1000km, **[spread]{.underline}** as **[evenly]{.underline}** across the
surface of this sphere as orbital mechanics would allow. **[Is humanity
cut off from space?]{.underline}**

I'm guessing **[the world has launched]{.underline}** about **[10,000
tons of satellites total]{.underline}**. For guessing purposes, **[I'll
assume 2,500 tons of satellites]{.underline}** and junk **[currently in
High LEO]{.underline}**. If satellites are made of aluminum, with a
density of 2.70 g/cm3, **[then that's 839,985,870 1cm
cubes]{.underline}**. A sphere for an orbit of 1,000km has a surface
area of 682,752,000 square KM. So **[there would be one
cube]{.underline}** of junk **[per .81 square KM. If a rocket traveled
through that, its odds of hitting that cube are tiny - less than 1 in
10,000]{.underline}**.

So **[even in the worst case, we don't lose access to
space]{.underline}**.

Now though you can travel through the debris, you couldn't keep a
satellite alive for long in this orbit of death.
**[Kessler]{.underline}** Syndrome **[at its worst just prevents us from
putting satellites in certain orbits]{.underline}**.

**[In real life, there's a lot of factors that make Kessler syndrome
even less of a problem than our worst case though
experiment.]{.underline}**

- **[Debris would be spread over a volume of space, not a single orbital
  surface, making collisions orders of magnitudes less
  likely]{.underline}**.

- **[Most impact debris will have a slower orbital velocity than either
  of its original pieces - this makes it deorbit much
  sooner]{.underline}**.

- **[Any collision will create large and small objects. Small objects
  are much more affected by atmospheric drag and deorbit faster, even in
  a few months from high LEO. Larger objects can be tracked by earth
  based radar and avoided]{.underline}**.

- **[The planned big new constellations are not in High LEO, but in Low
  LEO for faster communications with the earth. They aren't an issue for
  Kessler]{.underline}**.

- **[Most importantly, all new]{.underline}** satellite **[launches
  since the]{.underline}** 19**[90's are required to include a plan to
  get rid of the satellite at the end of its useful life (usually by
  deorbiting)]{.underline}**

So **[the realistic worst case is that insurance premiums on satellites
go up a bit. Given the current trend toward much smaller, cheaper micro
satellites, this wouldn't even have a huge effect]{.underline}**.

I'm removing Kessler Syndrome from my list of things to worry about.
