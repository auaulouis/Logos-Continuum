Recent **[technological advances]{.underline}**, **[changing climactic
conditions]{.underline}**, **[and receding sea ice]{.underline}**
**[have made Arctic resources more accessible than
before]{.underline}**, leading to what many see as a 21st-century "gold
rush" to extract many of the economically important metals, minerals,
and hydrocarbons locked up in the Arctic tundra and oceans.

But, **[due to the fragile nature of the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[there
are critical concerns]{.underline}** **[about the]{.underline}**
widespread **[environmental impact of mining]{.underline}** in the
region. **[Balancing the need for dwindling resources with the potential
impact of resource exploration in one of the world\'s last great,
largely unspoiled wildernesses has become a hugely sensitive
issue]{.underline}**.

This article will explore **[Arctic mining]{.underline}** and its
opportunities, **[challenges]{.underline}**, environmental
considerations, and future.

Opportunities in Arctic Mining

Mining in the Arctic region traces back to the 17th century when coal
was mined in the Svalbard archipelago in Norway. Since then, numerous
industrially and economically important mineral resources have been
discovered and exploited. Russia discovered silver and gold in the 18th
century, the Canadian Gold Rush of the 19th century, and oil and natural
gas in several areas in the 20th century.1

Several rare-earth elements, such as neodymium and terbium, critical for
modern industries, including the electronics sector, are present in
incomparable amounts in the Arctic. Significant volumes of minerals such
as zinc, gold, lead, and iron, precious stones such as rubies and
diamonds, and even construction materials, such as sand and gravel, are
found in the region.1

The main players in the Arctic region are Canada, the United States,
Russia, and the Nordic nations. Canada is the third-largest producer of
rough diamonds in the world, Alaska produces 12 percent of the world's
coal, Russia extracts 40% of the world's palladium, and Sweden produces
93% of the EU's iron ore.1 Half of the income of Canada's Northwest
Territories comes from mining.

The economic opportunities locked up in the Arctic tundra and oceans are
vast: changing climactic conditions and the retreating sea ice open
areas of the Arctic previously inaccessible to mining companies. In
recent years, for example, more than 400 oil and gas fields have been
discovered north of the Arctic Circle.2

Huge opportunities for mineral extraction exist deep in the Arctic
Ocean. According to the WWF, Norway has recently announced plans to mine
the deep sea bed, with a proposal to open up 281,000 km2 of the Arctic
ocean floor, an area nearly as big as that of the Scandinavian nation's
mainland.3 Mining in the Arctic would have huge benefits for economic
development and job creation.

Challenges in Arctic Mining

**[While extracting the Arctic's mineral, metal, and hydrocarbon
resources presents substantial economic and technological opportunities,
the field is fraught with challenges]{.underline}**. Despite the
challenges, mining the Arctic for resources such as lithium, for
example, is seen as crucial for the energy transition to a green future

#### That collapses the Arctic ecosystem and biodiversity, particularly fish stocks.

**[Impact of mining in the Arctic]{.underline}**

**[Kvanefjeld, a multi-element deposit, illustrates the tremendous
challenges. It is one of the largest known rare earth element
deposits]{.underline}** **[in the world and could meet global demand for
150 years if consumption remains constant]{.underline}**. The site also
contains a large amount of uranium. With the lifting of the zero
tolerance policy towards uranium mining in 2013 despite protests from
civil society, conditions are now in place for mining Kvanefjeld.

**[The Arctic is a very fragile ecosystem]{.underline}**. **[It is
extremely difficult to access information and studies on the precise
environmental and social impacts]{.underline}** of the Kvanefjeld
project. Studies conducted by the Australian company Greenland Minerals
and Energy Limited (GMEL) are not publicly accessible. **[Nevertheless,
a number of potential environmental impacts and risks related to mining
rare earths and uranium can be identified.]{.underline}**

**[Mining wastes]{.underline}** **[and refining residues]{.underline}**,
especially, **[pose a threat to the environment and
population]{.underline}**. In a worst case scenario **[these could lead
to large scale contamination]{.underline}** **[of the region's entire
river system]{.underline}** -- **[right up to the sea]{.underline}** --
**[releasing fluoride]{.underline}**, **[heavy metals]{.underline}**
**[and radioactive substances]{.underline}**. Environmental
organizations have warned that GMEL will not be in a position to
adequately deal with the anticipated environmental fall-outs.

**[The risk of water contamination]{.underline}** **[and its impact
on]{.underline}** drinking water and **[fish stocks]{.underline}**
**[are]{.underline}** also one of the main **[concerns]{.underline}** of
the local population. At another level, international mining companies
tend to employ cheaper or better qualified foreign labour. **[The
resulting influx of migrants can cause]{.underline}** not just
**[tensions]{.underline}** but also lead to the gradual disappearance of
traditional forms of living.

#### Arctic fisheries decline causes great power war.

**[Humans have always depended on the sea]{.underline}**. For as long as
there have been fishermen, **[there have been conflicts over
fish]{.underline}**. And though it may seem anachronistic, the **[odds
that a squabble over fishing rights could turn into a major armed
conflict are rising]{.underline}**. **[The return of great-power
competition has actually increased the likelihood of a war over
fish.]{.underline}** The past 17 years of the fight against terrorism,
and Washington's renewed focus on developing high-end capabilities to
prepare for great-power conflict, have led to a lack of preparation for
a low-end, seemingly mundane but increasingly likely source of conflict
in the world: food.

As incomes rise around the world, so too does the demand for
food---especially protein. The United Nations currently estimates that
between mid-2017 and 2050, the number of humans on Earth will rise by 29
percent, from 7.6 billion to 9.8 billion. Most of that population growth
will occur in Asia, Africa, and Latin America---areas where millions of
people have recently risen from deep poverty to the middle class. Part
of a middle-class lifestyle is a middle-class diet, which includes far
more protein than poor people consume. **[As a result of that shift, the
global demand for protein will outpace population growth, increasing
between 32 and 78 percent, according to some estimates]{.underline}**.
Meeting that demand could require an additional 62 to 159 million metric
tons of protein per year. **[To maintain political support at home,
leaders must ensure access to the high-quality food that is part of a
middle-class lifestyle.]{.underline}**

The supply of both wild and farmed fish will not keep up. The current
annual global catch of seafood is 94 million metric tons. And all around
the world, the wild populations of both migratory fish, such as tuna,
and less mobile species, such as flounder, are being overfished.
Scarcity has already forced Chinese fishing fleets further and further
afield in search of their catch. **[Serious international efforts to
manage the world's wild fisheries are underway]{.underline}**, but this
work is stymied by widespread illegal, unreported, and unregulated (or
IUU) fishing. Today, such harvests comprise somewhere from 20 to 50
percent of the **[global catch and inflict economic, social, and
environmental damage]{.underline}** on some of the world's most
vulnerable populations as fisheries collapse from overfishing and poor
and rural fishing communities wrestle with the subsequent loss of income
and, eventually, their social fabric. The classic example of this is
fishermen in Central America turning to drug cartels for employment or
poaching from closed fisheries, feeding the cycle of violence and
environmental damage.

The **[political leaders of rising powers will feel enormous pressure to
secure the resources their citizens demand---even if it means violating
international norms and rules]{.underline}**. **[This pressure could sow
the seeds of potential conflict in two distinct ways. The first is that
some states will overplay their hand when using fishing fleets and
fisheries enforcement to exert influence in contested waters. The second
is that illegal fishing, driven by exploding domestic demand and
collapsing supply, will be met with increasingly aggressive enforcement
by America or its allies---which could quickly escalate and spill over
into actual conflict.]{.underline}**

The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, commonly
referred to as UNCLOS, is the foundational document for all maritime
territorial claims; more than 150 countries, but not the United States,
have already ratified the treaty. According to UNCLOS, a state can
exclusively claim any resource, including fish, within 200 nautical
miles of the base lines of the habitable landmasses it controls. Such
areas are called exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Each state is
responsible for managing its own fisheries within its EEZ. But beyond
these exclusive zones, **[regulation of fishing and activity on the high
seas is managed by more than 20 international and regional bodies, with
widely varied mandates and resources. Enforcement is carried out by a
patchwork of agencies and coalitions around the world]{.underline}**, ad
hoc partnerships, and bilateral agreements among nations. If that
arrangement sounds ripe for dispute, it is.

**[There are dozens of contested maritime claims around the world,
including one between Canada and the United States]{.underline}** over
two small islands off the coast of New Brunswick. Currently, the most
consequential of these contested waters are the South and East China
seas, where China has made outsized claims---accompanied by naval
patrols and an island-building campaign. Beijing hopes to legitimate its
territorial claims by establishing and expanding its physical presence
in these areas. Fishing vessels represent an ideal way to create that
presence---without provoking a military response---since they are
notionally nongovernmental and thus give their country of origin some
plausible deniability. They are also cheap compared with military
vessels and are more mobile and scalable than fixed structures such as
oil platforms (let alone man-made islands).

For years, China has subsidized and provided armed escorts for forays by
its fishing fleet into its neighbors' EEZs and assertively enforced
Chinese law on non-Chinese fishermen operating in contested waters.
Since the 1990s, China has unilaterally declared large swaths of the
South China Sea closed to fishermen for months at a time. This closure
is enforced by armed China Coast Guard vessels, which have been involved
in a series of violent confrontations with foreign fishermen. This
heavy-handed approach would be relatively unremarkable if the closed
area was actually recognized Chinese territory. In this case, however,
China is acting in international water or in the EEZs of other
countries. The situation is roughly analogous to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service using deadly force to stop Canadian deer hunters from
shooting a doe out of season in Vancouver.

China Coast Guard and People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy vessels also
appear to have stepped up escorts of Chinese-flagged fishing fleets as
they venture into fishing grounds, particularly those around a set of
contested islands in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku in Japan
and the Diaoyu in China. The Japan Coast Guard has responded by
increasing its own presence in the area. Should a China Coast Guard or
PLA Navy vessel fire on a Japan Coast Guard ship, supposedly in defense
of a Chinese fishing fleet, the Japanese would likely retaliate, and
both sides could easily escalate.

**[There are other ways that fish can trigger war. Crackdowns on illegal
and unregulated fishing already routinely threaten to spiral into
violence.]{.underline}**

**[China currently consumes a third of the global fish catch. Officials
there have made it clear that they believe that meeting the expectations
of their increasingly affluent population is key to preserving political
stability---and thus is a core national security
interest]{.underline}**. But despite participating in the international
bodies dedicated to improving fisheries regulation and maritime
governance, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
International Maritime Organization (IMO), the environmental advocacy
group Greenpeace estimates that China has the world's largest
distant-water fishing fleet, with more than 2,500 vessels, and has been
accused of industrial-scale IUU fishing in waters as far away as those
off the coast of Senegal and Argentina, where China cannot even pretend
to have territorial claims.

Cases that involve sincerely held **[fishing rights also risk triggering
violent conflicts]{.underline}**. Consider a hypothetical---but
plausible---example in which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro trades
his country's fishing rights to China, as other impoverished countries
have done, to cover part of Venezuela's \$60 billion in outstanding
debts. China would then have legal claim to Venezuelan waters, some of
which could be contested given Venezuela's history of border disputes
with Guyana and Colombia. If Beijing continues to expand the practice of
escorting its fishing fleet with armed China Coast Guard vessels, the
chances for a violent exchange would continue to rise---as would the
risk of the United States becoming involved.

**[Future resource scarcity could also trigger a fish-related conflict.
If global fish stocks collapse around 2050, as current trends suggest
they will, national governments are going to feel intense pressure to
ensure a regular food supply for their populations. This pressure could
lead more powerful countries to try to grab the resources of smaller or
vulnerable neighbors]{.underline}**.

**[Russia and the United States might also be tempted to establish
claims against one another]{.underline}** in the waters that separate
Alaska and Siberia. The U.S. Coast Guard has conducted patrols in the
Bering Sea since 1867, the year of the Alaska Purchase. (In 1990, U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze signed an agreement to establish a maritime boundary line
between the USSR and the United States. The U.S. Senate ratified the
agreement, but neither the leaders of the collapsing Soviet Union nor
their Russian successors followed suit.) **[As pressure on fisheries
increases, Russian leaders may decide that it is time to challenge the
de facto border outright. The opening of the Arctic, combined with
Russia's significantly larger Arctic-capable fleet and infrastructure,
would enable Moscow to mount a credible challenge to U.S. control of one
of its richest fisheries.]{.underline}**

**[The U.S. has been an Arctic nation---meaning it possesses
resources]{.underline}** and territory **[above the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}**---since it purchased Alaska in 1867. It also
supports research and upholds treaties in Antarctica.

**[The Arctic Circle has rare earth minerals]{.underline}** and untapped
oil and gas. As of June 2020, about 13% of oil resources and 30% of gas
resources are undiscovered in the region.

**[Icebreaker ships will help the U.S. remain competitive]{.underline}**
with Russia and China**[. The Coast Guard uses them to access strategic
and economic interests in the Arctic region]{.underline}**. **[These
ships are the most efficient and effective tool for]{.underline}**
conducting research and **[maintaining access in the icy waters where
these are valuable U.S. resources]{.underline}**.

**[But the federal government has not invested in new icebreaker ships
since the Healy was commissioned in 1999]{.underline}**. **[The U.S.
does not have any working icebreakers in U.S.-claimed Arctic waters
north of Alaska.]{.underline}**

**[The Coast Guard's icebreaking fleet has a total of two ships: the
Polar Star and the Healy]{.underline}**.

**[The Polar Star]{.underline}**, commissioned more than four decades
ago, **[has passed its 30-year life expectancy]{.underline}**. It makes
only one annual trip to Antarctica to resupply the McMurdo Station.

**[The Healy suffered an electrical fire]{.underline}** while on a
mission in the Arctic in August 2020 and will not resume service until
August 2021.

In other words: **[One ship has surpassed its intended lifespan, while
the other has been incapacitated for one year]{.underline}**.

## 2NC/1NR Backlines

### No REM Mining Now\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Any current mining is in the very early stages or facing immense resistance.

**[Resistance Throughout the Arctic Region]{.underline}**

With available reserves and refinement of REEs and other strategic
metals concentrated in a few states around the world, the Arctic
provides an opportunity for competing powers to change the status quo of
the minerals market. **[The cost of extracting these resources decreases
with every centimeter of ice lost, and advances in mining technology are
making resource extraction]{.underline}** economically
**[feasible]{.underline}** despite the immense initial investments.

**[Greenland]{.underline}**, long speculated to hold colossal untapped
wealth, **[had so far seen little investment]{.underline}** **[because
of its terrain]{.underline}** partially **[covered by ice]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** therefore **[difficult to develop]{.underline}**.
In turn, the EU, since 2023, has formalised agreements declaring
interest in "Greenland's extensive natural riches". Greenland's southern
and western **[regions are still being surveyed]{.underline}** as the
government grants dozens of mining permits to incentivise further
exploration. **[Much opposition is present]{.underline}** among the
native Inuit communities in the large island, as they refuse to see
their homelands turned into open mine pit operations and while the
protest actions resulted in some success, particularly in Greenland's
parliament passing legislation to buranium mining and cease development
of the Kuannersuit mine, which was to be one of the biggest rare earth
deposits in the world, interest in Greenland is only continuing to
increase.

In other arctic regions, Canada has had proven deposits of (REEs)
nearing at least 15.2 million tons of rare earth oxide, which means that
such reserves could place the country next to nations like China in
terms of competitiveness on this market. Reports since a decade ago have
hinted at Canada's potential to be a significant exporter but mentioned
**[extraction difficulties]{.underline}** **[due to the lack
infrastructure]{.underline}** **[and immense initial
investment]{.underline}** before potentially yielding results, possibly
taking years before seeing progress. Industry figures searching for gold
have described the northernmost regions of Canada as the state's "newest
mining-friendly territory." More and more mines searching for gold,
REEs, and diamonds are being established in spite of the existing
movements against mining in other regions of the country.

#### REM mining isn't guaranteed. There are still barriers, but the plan helps overcome them.

**Davey 24** -- Contributor at AZO Mining.

Reginald Davey, "Mining in the Arctic: Opportunities, Challenges, and
Environmental Considerations," AZO Mining, 09-13-2024,

Firstly, **[the Arctic landscape is notoriously difficult to
explore]{.underline}**, **[with many remote and largely inaccessible
regions presenting huge logistical and technical challenges for mining
companies.]{.underline}** **[Permanent ice sheets make reaching these
areas extraordinarily difficult]{.underline}**, for instance.

Additionally, **[extracting and sending the resources back to areas
where they can be used requires vast infrastructure]{.underline}**,
**[such as ports, roads, rail networks, communication networks, the
mines themselves, and permanent housing for miners]{.underline}** and
other workers within the mining industry.

**[Mining companies also need to address huge regulatory, legal, and
environmental challenges]{.underline}** **[to make large-scale mining
operations in the Arctic feasible]{.underline}**. **[Many
observers]{.underline}**, such as Greenpeace and the WWF, **[are
concerned about the impact of mining on fragile and largely unspoiled
ecosystems]{.underline}**.

**[Regional and geopolitical tensions concerning the Arctic also
persist, causing further challenges]{.underline}**. The Arctic is
largely controlled by a handful of nations, with resources largely
present within national borders. **[Companies should be mindful
of]{.underline}** these **[geopolitical tensions]{.underline}** and the
needs of Indigenous communities that rely on local resources and
biodiversity to support themselves.

In short, if large-scale mining of the critical resources contained in
the Arctic is to be successful, **[companies need to consider a plethora
of technical, socioeconomic, environmental, ethical, and sociopolitical
issues and challenges.]{.underline}**

Environmental Considerations

**[Mining the Arctic for valuable minerals and metals is a controversial
and polarizing subject, mainly because of its potential environmental
impacts]{.underline}**. **[The Arctic is home to many species which
would be negatively affected by mining operations,]{.underline}** as
well as many Indigenous populations. **[Pollution and emissions from
mining operations in the Arctic could also hasten climate
change.]{.underline}**

Take the aforementioned deep ocean mining proposed by the Norwegian
government in 2023.3. Aside from the environmental impact on vulnerable
marine ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, the WWF warned that
the **[proposals could break international laws and
conventions]{.underline}**, such as the High Sea Treaty.

**[Any potential mining operation]{.underline}** in the Arctic **[should
consider its environmental impact]{.underline}**. With sustainability
such a hot button topic within the mining sector currently, **[the vast
benefits of recovering critical resources such as rare-earth elements
should not come at the cost of fragile ecosystems]{.underline}**,
**[biodiversity]{.underline}**, local Indigenous populations, **[and
negative climate impacts.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, sustainable practices should be front and center in Arctic
mining: renewable energy, mining area rehabilitation, green
technologies, and adherence to international environmental standards and
agreements are vital if the benefits of Arctic mining are to be
maximized.

In Summary

**[The Arctic is one of the last great frontiers on
Earth]{.underline}**. Incomparable reserves of resources critical for
modern industry, such as rare-earth elements, economically and
technologically essential metals, including gold and palladium, and
hydrocarbons, such as oil and natural gas, have focused significant
attention on this emerging field within the mining industry.

A changing climate and innovative, improved mining **[technologies have
made these resources more accessible, but many scientists and experts
agree that exploiting them could hasten climate change and cause the
collapse of fragile ecosystems and biodiversity]{.underline}**. If the
full opportunities of Arctic mining are to be realized, the benefits
should not come at the expense of the environment and sustainability.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro **[Mayorkas spoke
about]{.underline}** the **[great power competition,
detailing]{.underline}** the **[progress of the Russian and Chinese
icebreaker efforts and what their Arctic capabilities would mean for the
U.S.]{.underline}** if left uncontested in his opening remarks at the
pact signing. **[Yielding the Arctic reserves of energy]{.underline}**,
**[rare earth minerals and sea lanes]{.underline}** would have severe
consequences for the American people, Mayorkas said.

"Simply put: Russia and China are strengthening their capabilities in
the Arctic, and we cannot afford to allow our own **[United States Coast
Guard and United States Navy]{.underline}** to **[fall
behind]{.underline}**," Mayorkas said.

**[American icebreakers]{.underline}** USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) and USCGC
Polar Star (WAGB-10), constructed in the 20th century and overtasked
with missions in the North and South **[Poles, are dated and stretched
thin.]{.underline}** Russian and Chinese fleets of icebreakers have been
constructed more recently and are expanding, with Mayorkas noting the
launch of the latest Project 22220 icebreaker Chukotka last week. Three
Chinese icebreakers sailed to the Arctic over the summer in a first that
analysts claim is a signal of Beijing's intentions for the region.

**[U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker efforts have been mired in delays and
accidents at sea.]{.underline}** The delivery date of the agency's first
Polar Security Cutter has been pushed back three years behind schedule

**[High transportation]{.underline}** **[and energy costs]{.underline}**
**[in remote arctic regions are a significant economic barrier to
development]{.underline}**. **[The costs for transporting]{.underline}**
concentrates for further processing and metal extraction at a distant
facility **[can be insurmountable for remote locations]{.underline}**.
Process **[technologies that allow shipment of metals rather than ore
from remote locations would greatly improve project
economics]{.underline}**, and increase domestic production. At the same
time, many conventional refining and metal extraction processes are
energy intensive, making them prohibitively expensive in remote Arctic
areas that face some of the nation's highest energy costs. Processes
which improve recovery efficiency or concentrate grade without requiring
more energy have the greatest potential to enhanced value added
activity. As an example, in the gold mining industry bio-oxidation of
sulfides followed by gold leaching is a method to recover gold from
appropriate ores. **[Extending this or similar process technology to
appropriate critical mineral ores could significantly improve the
economics of remote deposits, bringing more into
production.]{.underline}**

3\. Specific **[environmental issues associated with REE
production]{.underline}**

**[REE mineral deposit]{.underline}** types **[can strongly influence
environmental impacts]{.underline}**, as processing methods vary based
on the physicochemical properties of deposit (Weng et al. 2013).
Significant **[use of chemicals]{.underline}** (e.g., acids and
alkalis), REE content in tailings, and radioactive element (Th and U)
concentrations in ores **[are]{.underline}** arguably the most **[common
concerns]{.underline}** (Weng et al. 2013). REEs in mineral deposits are
usually hosted by a wide and diverse range (more than 200) of
REE-bearing minerals (the main REE-bearing minerals are reviewed by Weng
et al. (2013) and Batapola et al. (2020)). The REE deposits exist
primarily in four geologic environments (Weng et al. 2013; Dostal 2017):
carbonatites, alkaline igneous systems, ion-absorption clay deposits
(mainly in China), and monazite-bearing placer deposits. Carbonatite and
alkaline rocks constitute the majority of the world's REE resources, but
LREEs are relatively more abundant in carbonatites than HREEs, and
alkaline igneous rocks have relatively low total REE grades and contain
small amounts of U and Th. In Canada, the major REE-containing mineral
types are carbonatite and alkaline igneous (the mineral types and
geological province are listed in Appendix Table A1); therefore both the
generation of mine tailings and the potential release of radionuclides
are environmental risks for REE development in Canada.

The principal flow sheets of REE production include five steps: (1)
mining of REE-bearing mineral ore including silicates, fluorocarbonates,
oxides/hydroxides, and phosphates; (2) beneficiation of rare earth ore
mixtures; (3) separation of REE ores into individual REE minerals; (4)
reduction of REE minerals to individual REE metals; and (5) refining of
individual REE metals to purify REEs (reviewed by Chi et al. (2004),
Khan et al. (2017), and Wu et al. (2018)). REE production and processing
(mainly milling and smelting operations) are characterized by high
energy and resource consumption and high levels of pollution, as well as
complicated sequential processes compared with other metals (Davris et
al. 2017; Haque et al. 2014). For example, the extraction of 1 tonne (t)
of REE requires 4.41 t of sulphuric acid, 12.32 t sodium chloride, 1.64
t of sodium hydroxide, 1.17 t of hydrochloric acid, 1.90 t of water, and
milling of almost 50 t of mineral ore at Bayan Obo in Mongolia, and
generally, the energy used to obtain 1 t of an individual REE varies
from 38 GJ to 48 GJ, except for scandium (148 GJ·t--1) and yttrium (75
GJ·t--1) (Peiró and Méndez 2013). Many potential environmental and
health issues are generated by this processing with significant
radionuclides, heavy metals, and acids in water discharge, tailings, and
air emissions, as well as a high energy cost.

**[The radioactive pollution and REE toxicity]{.underline}** **[caused
by mining and processing are unique environmental risks]{.underline}**
**[that are different from]{.underline}** most **[other mining
contexts]{.underline}**. **[The radioactive pollution generated during
REE production is]{.underline}** mainly **[caused by the co-occurrence
of REE deposits with radioactive elements such as]{.underline}** U
(**[uranium]{.underline}**), Th (**[thorium]{.underline}**), **[and
their decay product]{.underline}**s (e.g., radium) (Golev et al. 2014).
The natural radionuclide content of the main REE minerals was summarized
by García et al. (2020). Usually, **[there is a higher content of
radioactive elements in the environment near a REE mining
site.]{.underline}** For example, the mean content of airborne Th in
total suspended particulate ranged from 820 μBq·m−3 in mining areas to
39 720 μBq·m−3 in smelting areas in the Bayan Obo mining region, far
higher than the global background level of 0.5 μBq·m−3 (Wang et al.
2016). As a result, **[biota near REE mines has higher health risks from
exposure to high levels of radioactive elements]{.underline}**. While
radioactive pollution has been an important issue receiving attention in
public health for some time, **[the direct toxicity of REEs is often
overlooked]{.underline}** because of the insignificant amounts found in
the environment naturally and the benefits of REEs in agricultural
production. The growth in REE extraction and manufacturing has led to a
strong increase of REE concentration in localized surface environments
(Tepe et al. 2014; Hatje et al. 2016). For example, the concentrations
of REEs in the Sidaosha River (passing through Baotou City where the
Bayan Obo REE deposit is located) exceed 30 000 μg·L--1 of suspended
particles and surface sediments, respectively, which was 200 times
higher than the average value of REEs of other rivers in Northern China
(Liang et al. 2014). As emerging contaminants, their toxicity is
attracting more attention (Gwenzi et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2019),
especially in countries such as Canada, which are planning major REE
exploitation projects in the near future.

4\. The transport of REEs in the environment

**[The mobility of REEs and their movement in the environment are
similar to other potentially toxic metals and metalloids]{.underline}**
(e.g., arsenic and mercury) driven by three main mechanisms: (1)
sorption--desorption, (2) precipitation--dissolution, and (3)
reduction--oxidation processes (Violante et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2001).
**[Soil and solution components]{.underline}** (e.g., ligands, anions,
clay minerals, colloids, and suspended matter), **[pH, and redox
condition are considered as critical environmental
parameters]{.underline}** controlling these three mechanisms as they
influence the transformations among REE fractions (see Supplementary
Table S11). Generally, REEs in the environment can be partitioned into
six fractions based on their geochemical behaviours (see Supplementary
Table S21; Tessier et al. 1979; Cao et al. 2000): water soluble (R(ws)),
ion-exchangeable (R(ie)), bound to carbonates (R(cb)), bound to iron and
manganese oxides (R(fm)), bound to organic matter (R(om)), and residual
(R(rd)). REE bioavailability and potential migratory capacity depends on
their fraction, ranked from strong to weak as follows: R(ws) and R(ie)
\> R(cb) \> R(fm) \> R(om) \> R(rd) (Weng et al. 2013). R(ws) and R(ie)
are quite mobile and bioavailable to biota (Lu et al. 2003). **[In
natural environments, R(rd) is a major form that is stable and cannot be
absorbed directly by organisms]{.underline}** (Pang et al. 2002), but
REEs exist in more active states in mining areas, e.g., R(ie) in soils
and dissolved R(ws) in water bodies (Liang et al. 2014). Mining
activities disrupt the spatial distribution and natural state of
minerals, including notably turning deposits into smaller unconsolidated
particles with a relatively higher specific surface area. More REE
minerals are transported from subsurfaces to surfaces, and these
surficial mining areas become enriched in total REEs. Those REE minerals
significantly increase the source supply of REEs in the Earth's surface
by exposing them to much higher rates of weathering and erosion (e.g.,
rain, wind, microbial decomposition) than seen in more consolidated
subsurface locations. A conceptual model based on recently published
literature (mainly adapted from Gwenzi et al. 2018) is presented in Fig.
2. This model shows that hydrological and wind-driven (e.g., weathering,
dust, and atmospheric fallout) processes, as well as human activities
(e.g., REE mining and international trade) play a key role in
environmental mobilization and transport of REEs. Lastly, additional
REEs by mining mostly settle into soil and water, leading to increased
exposure for terrestrial and aquatic food webs.

**[REEs in soil can enter plant cells through soil--plant
pathways]{.underline}**. For most plants, REE concentrations generally
follow the order of root \> leaf \> stem \> flower \> fruit (He et al.
2019a; Hu et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2002), but close to REE mining or other
polluted areas, the REE content is higher in leaf surfaces because of
dust fall (Zhuang et al. 2017a, 2017b). Water is the main exposure
intermediary for aquatic organisms. Increased REEs by mining can enter
adjacent aquatic systems through industrial and domestic wastewater, as
well as surface runoff, and then deposit in sediments or remain
distributed in the water column, depending on particle size and makeup
and mixing regimes (Chua 1998; Liang et al. 2014). For example,
increased usage in Gd-based contrast agents (Gd-CAs) for magnetic
resonance imaging contributed to a more than one order of magnitude
increase in anthropogenic Gd concentrations in San Francisco Bay (from
8.27 to 112 pmol·kg−1) over the two decades from 1993 to 2013 (Hatje et
al. 2016).

Ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact are the three main pathways
for the entry of REEs into humans (Fig. 2). Ingestion is mainly
associated with REE-contaminated food and drinking water and medicine
containing REEs. Gd-CAs are a prominent cause of REE ingestion, and some
gadolinium accumulation in brain and liver tissues has been reported
(Kanda et al. 2015; Frenzel et al. 2017). On the other hand, most Gd-CAs
are excreted and released into waste water systems and then are
discharged into surface and groundwater, potentially subsequently
reaching back to drinking water supplies (Aime and Caravan 2009; Bichler
et al. 2016; Schmidt et al. 2019). Inhalation of airborne dust
containing REEs is another pathway by which they can enter the human
body. High concentrations of REEs (56.9 to 165.4 μg·L−1) were found in
lung fluids of people working in REE-associated industries (Censi et al.
2011). Further, REEs can enter the human body through dermal absorption
(Sun et al. 2017), for example, through bathing using water containing
high REEs and exposure to REE dust. Current research shows that REEs can
accumulate in various human tissues: hair (Wei et al. 2013), blood (Li
et al. 2013), brain (Chen 2005), bone (Zaichick et al. 2011), liver
(Chen and Zhu 2009), and lungs (Censi et al. 2011). Risks are not
explicitly well understood though, and it is likely that there could be
subtle positive and negative health effects due to these emerging
contaminants, as well as the largely negative oxidative stress effects
that have been reported (Pagano et al. 2015a, 2015b).

5\. A review of REE toxicity on organisms

5.1. Method

A literature review of published, peer-reviewed studies on the REEs
affecting the environment available in Scopus
(https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus) was done in two steps, first
in November 2019 and then in January 2021 to update the review. Searches
were conducted using the following combined keywords: "terbium" OR
"dysprosium" OR "holmium" OR "erbium" OR "thulium" OR "ytterbium" OR
"lutetium" OR "yttrium" OR "lanthanum" OR "cerium" OR "praseodymium" OR
"neodymium" OR "promethium" OR "samarium" OR "europium" OR "gadolinium"
OR "scandium" OR "lanthanide" OR "rare earth element\*" AND "health
risk∗" OR "health impact∗" OR "toxicity\*" OR "animals\*" OR "plant\*"
OR "human\*" OR "microbiome\*" OR "environment\*" OR "bacteria\*" OR
"fungus\*" Also, Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com) was searched
to ensure that as many publications as possible were collected, and 27
580 references were acquired from these searches. In a second screening
stage, eligibility and exclusion criterion were determined. First, with
regards to literature type, only published peer-reviewed journal
articles of primary research and reviews were selected. Second, to avoid
any confusion and difficulties of translation, only on articles
published in English were kept. Thirdly, with regards to time frame,
articles published up to 2020 were selected to see the potential growth
and (or) evolution of research and related publications. As the review
process focused on REE toxicity to organisms, the subject areas were
restricted to "biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology",
"environmental science", "agricultural and biological sciences", and
"immunology and microbiology". Titles, keywords, and abstracts were
reviewed and screened following the above criteria. Finally, 1228
articles remained and were used for the analysis of publication volume
and subsequently classified into five topics of humans, plants, animals,
microbiome, and "others" (review articles and those about abiotic
effects and (or) environments).

5.2. State-of-the-art in REE-associated environmental risks and effects

The number of published studies on REE environmental risks and impacts
shows an increasing trend with time (Fig. 3), with a faster pace since
2011, likely because of the higher number of REE projects recently
undertaken outside of China. The attention received by different target
species or biotic groups in these studies is clearly uneven. The number
of annual published articles generally followed the order of plants \>
animals \> humans \> microorganisms. Initially most articles were about
plants and animals, and then the effect of REEs on humans and
microorganisms became the center of focus in an increasing number of
publications; however, research on humans and microbes is still less
abundant than for animals and plants up to 2020.

Review articles about environmental issues associated with REE
production were focused on ecological risks (mainly animal and plant
health), human health, and toxicity mechanisms of REEs. Little
information, however, has been synthesized on environmental and
individual factors that influence REE toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S11).

#### And risks large-scale resource disaster.

**Corwin 15** -- Contributor at the Duke Nicholas School of the
Environment.

Samuel Corwin, "The Case against Arctic Resource Exploration,"

https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/statsreview/samuel-corwin-the-case-against-arctic-resource-exploration/

**[Despite vast potential for Arctic energy resources, the Arctic should
remain unexplored]{.underline}** **[due to considerable environmental
effects]{.underline}** **[that resource exploration would have on the
Arctic, and the world, as a whole]{.underline}**. **[Arctic resource
exploration will have considerable effects on Arctic ice, global
warming, and the risk of environmental disaster.]{.underline}**

As nations seek to increase national revenue and decrease dependency on
foreign oil, various organizations increasingly look towards the Arctic
for resource exploration. The Arctic contains an estimated 13% of
undiscovered international oil, and approximately 30% of undiscovered
international gas (Berdanier, 2015). Of total Arctic energy resources,
gas comprises 67.7%, with oil making up 22.4%, and natural gas liquids
(NGL) coming in at 10% (Praprotnik, 2013). These Arctic resources could
account for an estimated 412,157 million barrels of oil equivalent
(Praprotnik, 2013). Potential Arctic resources could thus provide a
variable amount of energy and revenue for the five coastal states in the
Arctic: Canada, the United States, Russia, Norway, and Greenland. The
issue, however, is the severe environmental degradation that could
result from Arctic resource exploration.

Due to increased global warming over the past few decades that has
manifested in the form of increased global mean temperatures and more
extreme weather patterns, **[Arctic ice has decreased considerably, a
process that will greatly be exacerbated]{.underline}** **[by resource
exploration in the area]{.underline}**. **[As shipping vessels travel
through the Arctic, the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons emits
black carbon, which becomes lodged in Arctic snow and ice]{.underline}**
(Ebinger and Zambitakis, 2009). **[This black carbon darkens the ice and
snow, allowing it to absorb more sunlight, thus melting it at a faster
rate]{.underline}** (Ebinger and Zambitakis, 2009). Considering the
difficulty in navigating dense ice in the Arctic, an increased rate of
ice melt would make shipping through the region easier. **[Increased
ease of shipping would increase the amount of vessel traffic in the
area, further exacerbating the rate of ice melt]{.underline}** (Ebinger
and Zambitakis, 2009).

In addition to the issues of increasing the rate of melting ice in the
Arctic, **[resource exploration in the area will also aggravate global
warming]{.underline}**. **[The ice-capable ships needed to navigate the
Arctic burn more fuel than comparable transport ships because extra fuel
is required to push through the ice, causing an unnecessary rise in
shipping-related emissions]{.underline}** (Ebinger and Zambitakis,
2009). Furthermore, environmental **[scientists tend to agree that to
prevent irreversible and devastating effects of global warming, the
average global temperature increase cannot exceed 2°
Celsius]{.underline}** (McGlade and Ekins, 2015). In a recent study
examining the effects of burning fossil fuels on global warming,
scientists explored various feasible scenarios in which global
temperature rise does not exceed 2° C by 2050 (McGlade and Ekins, 2015).
In all of those scenarios, they determined that all **[Arctic resources
needed to be classified as unburnable]{.underline}** in order to prevent
a 2° C global temperature increase (McGlade and Ekins, 2015).

**[The most destructive object on the planet, as we noted in Chapter 3,
is the human jawbone]{.underline}**. **[The need to keep it fed is
responsible, every year, for the loss of up to 75 billion tonnes of
topsoil, the wasting of six trillion tonnes of water, the release of
five million tonnes of pesticides, and 30 per cent of the world\'s
climate-wrecking carbon emissions]{.underline}**. In addition, the
contemporary food system is the chief driver of deforestation,
desertification, wildlife extinctions and impaired ecosystems. Among the
most striking examples of food\'s impact on the wild world are the 400+
\'dead zones\' spreading through the world\'s oceans from the Arabian
Sea, to the Baltic and the Mississippi delta. These are oxygenless
layers in the sea, where fish cannot survive. They are caused by topsoil
dislodged by land clearing, over-farming and over-grazing, the use of
huge quantities of artificial fertilisers, toxic chemicals and human
sewage**[. Along with overfishing they contribute to an ongoing collapse
in world wild fisheries and are a clear example of how the activity of
one part of the food system can impair another. Similarly, most inland
rivers and lakes in populated regions are eutrophic and polluted - and
no longer capable of producing as much food as in the past. The loss of
wild fisheries increases tensions between nations and fishers over what
remains and can lead to \'fish wars\']{.underline}**.8

The existing global food production system is therefore a major
contributor to the decline and failure of ecosystem services needed to
support the human population. This in turn rebounds on the food system
itself. **[Furthermore, the extinction of wild animals and plants
deprives the food industry of many edible species that may be needed as
part of a healthy, diverse global diet in future]{.underline}**.

The solution to the extinction crisis is to cease farming and grazing on
about half the currently farmed area of the planet (25 million square
kilometres), transfer food production to the cities where it can take
advantage of all the nutrients and water currently being wasted, and
employ many of the world\'s farmers and indigenous people as Stewards of
the Earth to manage the rewilding and regeneration of former farmlands.
Food production can continue on the remaining 24 million square
kilometres using eco-agriculture. This process is further described in
Surviving the 21st Century and in Chapter 9 of this book.

How the existing food system plays into the risk of war can also be
viewed through the lens of environmental security: **[war damages
environments, making it harder for humans to sustain and feed
themselves - and ruined environments themselves become cauldrons of war.
This is plainly to be seen in the cases of Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and
the Horn of Africa]{.underline}**. **[What we most need are food systems
that do not cause knock-on damage to either the environment and
wildlife, the climate, the oceans or to consumer health - and which ease
tensions, so promoting peace, not conflict]{.underline}**. These are
described in Chapters 8 and 9.

Resource Scarcity

The average citizen of planet Earth today uses at least ten times the
volume of resources used by their grandparents a century ago. Since the
human population has also quadrupled over the same time, this means
humanity\'s gargantuan appetite for minerals, metals, timber, water,
food and energy has grown forty-fold in barely a hundred years. As the
Global Footprint Network explains, we are presently using enough \'stuff
for 1.6 Earths, not just the one we have. We now outrun the Earth\'s
natural ability to supply our needs in August each year.9 As with the
mining of groundwater, the decline and collapse of global resources like
soil, water and phosphorus, is often imperceptible to the individual:
people have simply no idea they are living on borrowed time and, with
that, comes enormous risk.

To make the issue of resource consumption a little more personal: you
(as an average individual citizen of the planet) will in your lifetime

\- use 99,720 tonnes (i.e. 40 Olympic pools) of fresh water

\- displace 750 tonnes of topsoil

\- consume 720 tonnes of metals and materials

\- use 80 billion joules of energy

\- release 288 tonnes of CO2

\- release 320 kilograms of toxic chemicals

\- waste 13.4 tonnes of food

\- destroy 800 square metres of forest.

Because of the long, cryptic, **[industrial and international trade
chains which hide it, most of us are unaware of the vast damage we do to
the planet through our simple habit of shopping.]{.underline}**

Yes, some of us have a notion that some of our purchases may be bad for
gorillas in the Congo, orangutans in Borneo or flamingos in the
Atacama - but we mostly have no true appreciation of the wider havoc we
inflict on the Earth and its natural systems by the \'innocent\' act of
consumption, which business and governments try constantly to convince
us is essential to \'growth and jobs\'.

It should therefore come as no surprise that the **[world finds itself
increasingly short of key resources like fresh water, soil, phosphorus,
timber and certain minerals - and that these shortages are giving rise
to tensions and even to conflicts]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[resource
scarcity has for some time been considered by strategic experts to be
one of the most likely causes of war in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}**.10

However, people are not equally responsible for the devastation of
Planet Earth. The diagram below (Figure 6.1), from Oxfam, illustrates
how just one tenth of humanity consumes five times as much in the way of
material resources (expressed here in the form of their carbon
footprint) as the poorest half of the world population. The affluent are
chiefly responsible for the destruction taking place on a global scale
as they seek to sustain lifestyles that the planet can no longer afford
or support.

**[The significance of this blind spot around consumption for global
food security is very great]{.underline}**. As described in earlier
chapters, the world food system depends critically on soil, water,
nutrients and a stable climate, to supply humanity\'s daily need for
nutriment - and all of these essential resources are in increasingly
short supply, chiefly because of our own mismanagement of them and our
collective failure to appreciate that they are finite. On current
trends, the **[existing food system will tend to break down, first
regionally and then globally, owing to resource scarcity from the 2020s
onward, and especially towards the mid century - unless there is radical
change in the world diet and the means by which we feed ourselves. This
will lead to increasing outbreaks of violence and war]{.underline}**.
Nobody, neither rich nor poor, will escape the consequences.

Weapons of Mass Destruction

**[Detonating just 50-100 out of the global arsenal of nearly 15,000
nuclear weapons would suffice to end civilisation in a nuclear winter,
causing worldwide famine]{.underline}** and economic collapse affecting
even distant nations, as we saw in the previous chapter in the section
dealing with South Asia. **[Eight nations now have the power to
terminate civilisation should they desire to do so -and two have the
power to extinguish the human species.]{.underline}** According to the
nuclear monitoring group Ploughshares, this arsenal is distributed as
follows:

\- Russia, 6600 warheads (2500 classified as \'retired\')

\- America, 6450 warheads (2550 classified as \'retired\')

\- France, 300 warheads

\- China, 270 warheads

\- UK, 215 warheads

\- Pakistan, 130 warheads

\- India, 120 warheads

\- Israel, 80 warheads

\- North Korea, 15-20 warheads.11

Although actual numbers of warheads have continued to fall from its peak
of 70,000 weapons in the mid 1980s, scientists argue the danger of
nuclear conflict in fact increased in the first two decades of the
twentyfirst century. **[This was due to the modernisation of existing
stockpiles, the adoption of dangerous new technologies such as robot
delivery systems, hypersonic missiles, artificial intelligence and
electronic warfare, and the continuing leakage of nuclear materials and
knowhow to non-nuclear nations and potential terrorist
organisations.]{.underline}**

**[In early 2018 the hands of the \'Doomsday Clock\', maintained by the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, were re-set at two minutes to
midnight]{.underline}**, **[the highest risk to humanity that it has
ever shown since the clock was introduced in 1953]{.underline}**. This
was due not only to the state of the world\'s nuclear arsenal, but also
to irresponsible language by world leaders, the growing use of social
media to destabilise rival regimes, and to the rising threat of
uncontrolled climate change (see below).12

In an historic moment on 17 July 2017, 122 nations voted in the UN for
the first time ever in favour of a treaty banning all nuclear weapons.
This called for comprehensive prohibition of \"a full range of
nuclear-weapon-related activities, such as undertaking to develop, test,
produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices, as well as the use or threat of use of
these weapons.\"13 However, 71 other countries - including all the
nuclear states - either opposed the ban, abstained or declined to vote.
The Treaty vote was nonetheless interpreted by some as a promising first
step towards abolishing the nuclear nightmare that hangs over the entire
human species.

In contrast, 192 countries had signed up to the Chemical Weapons
Convention to ban the use of chemical weapons, and 180 to the Biological
Weapons Convention. As of 2018, 96 per cent of previous world stocks of
chemical weapons had been destroyed - but their continued use in the
Syrian conflict and in alleged assassination attempts by Russia
indicated the world remains at risk.14

As things stand, **[the only entities that can afford to own nuclear
weapons are nations - and if humanity is to be wiped out, it will most
likely be as a result of an atomic conflict between
nations]{.underline}**. It follows from this that, if the world is to be
made safe from such a fate it will need to get rid of nations as a
structure of human self-organisation and replace them with wiser, less
aggressive forms of self-governance. After all, the nation state really
only began in the early nineteenth century and is by no means a
permanent feature of self-governance, any more than monarchies, feudal
systems or priest states. Although many people still tend to assume it
is. Between them, nations have butchered more than 200 million people in
the past 150 years and it is increasingly clear the world would be a far
safer, more peaceable place without either nations or nationalism. The
question is what to replace them with.

**[Although there may at first glance appear to be no close linkage
between weapons of mass destruction and food, in the twentyfirst century
with world resources of food, land and water under growing stress,
nothing can be ruled out]{.underline}**. Indeed, chemical weapons have
frequently been deployed in the Syrian civil war, which had drought,
agricultural failure and hunger among its early drivers. And nuclear
conflict remains a distinct possibility in South Asia and the Middle
East, especially, as these regions are already stressed in terms of
food, land and water, and their nuclear firepower or access to nuclear
materials is multiplying.

**[It remains an open question whether panicking regimes in Russia, the
USA or even France would be ruthless enough to deploy atomic weapons in
an attempt to quell invasion by tens of millions of desperate refugees,
fleeing famine and climate chaos in their own homelands - but the
possibility ought not to be ignored.]{.underline}**

That nuclear war is at least a possible outcome of food and climate
crises was first flagged in the report The Age of Consequences by Kurt
Campbell and the US-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies, which stated \'it is clear that even nuclear war cannot be
excluded as a political consequence of global warming\'.15 **[Food
insecurity is therefore a driver in the preconditions for the use of
nuclear weapons, whether limited or unlimited.]{.underline}**

A global famine is a likely outcome of limited use of nuclear weapons by
any country or countries - and would be unavoidable in the event of an
unlimited **[nuclear war between America and Russia, making it
unwinnable for either. And that, as the mute hands of the \'Doomsday
Clock\' so eloquently admonish, is also the most likely scenario for the
premature termination of the human species]{.underline}**.

**[The Arctic]{.underline}** today **[is playing an increasingly
prevalent role]{.underline}** **[in geopolitical
competition]{.underline}** between Russia, China and the West. **[This
is]{.underline}** particularly **[evident in]{.underline}** two maritime
sub-regions: **[the Barents Sea]{.underline}** (North Atlantic) **[and
the Bering]{.underline}** Sea (North Pacific). In addition to strategic
concerns associated with geopolitical competition**[, these Arctic
maritime domains play host to a range of issues around access to
maritime resources, most notably fisheries]{.underline}**.

These issues stand to evolve significantly as climate change contributes
to warming oceanic temperatures, shifting fish distributions and
changing demand for fisheries products. In the Arctic, surface air
temperatures are rising 2--4 times faster than the global average, with
warming waters causing some of the most significant shifts in fish
stocks globally, and marine catch potential in the Arctic increasing as
the anticipated ranges of some species extend poleward.

All this is challenging established management regimes for transboundary
resources, impacting both sustainable resource management at sea and
wider security relations in the Arctic.

The North Atlantic and Barents Sea

Located north of the Norwegian and Russian mainland and adjacent to the
Arctic Ocean itself, **[the Barents Sea is the breeding ground of
the]{.underline}** **[largest]{.underline}** cod **[stock in the
world]{.underline}** **[-- a critical resource]{.underline}** for
citizens of both countries. Since the 1970s,
**[cooperation]{.underline}** between Norway and Russia **[on
fisheries]{.underline}** in the Barents Sea **[has developed
pragmatically]{.underline}**. Often hailed as a prime example of
successful co-management of shared fish stocks, this regime has
withstood both the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

However, tensions are mounting along two axes. First, there are fears
that Russia could be utilising maritime space in the Barents Sea to
challenge NATO -- fears rooted in an assumption that any deliberate
Russian action is likely to be hybrid in form, remaining below the
threshold of direct warfare or direct conflict. Recent attention has
focused on the role of Russian fishing vessels in the Barents Sea, with
claims from the Norwegian naval academy that between 50 and 100 of those
operating in Norwegian waters could be linked to intelligence gathering
activities and pose a potential security threat. In parallel, there are
mounting concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure such
as subsea cables (particularly in the context of climate change) and the
way in which fishing vessels could be used in possible disruptive
action.

Second, **[fears]{.underline}** are rising **[around unintentional
escalation in the maritime domain]{.underline}**. The relatively high
level of military exercise **[activity in the North Atlantic means that
the danger of accidents involving fishers, both legitimate and illegal,
is real]{.underline}**. Another **[potential source of unintentional
escalation]{.underline}** **[could stem from the exercise
of]{.underline}** Norwegian **[maritime police authority]{.underline}**
towards Russian citizens. The Norwegian coast guard **[inspects
and]{.underline}** occasionally **[fines]{.underline}** Russian
**[fishers]{.underline}** in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ)
or the Fish Protection Zone around Svalbard, **[with the potential for
unintentional escalation]{.underline}** should a case take on a
state-state dimension.

**[The linkages between fisheries and security concerns here
are]{.underline}** thus **[apparent]{.underline}**. These issues are
likely to worsen as Arctic waters continue to warm. In this context,
**[if fisheries cooperation]{.underline}** between Norway and Russia
**[were to break down]{.underline}** and Norway were to deny Russian
fishers access to its waters, **[the potential for unintentional
escalation]{.underline}** in the course of interaction between the coast
guard and Russian fishing vessels **[could increase]{.underline}**.
Svalbard's waters beyond 12 nautical miles are a particularly sensitive
matter: Russia does not recognise Norway's jurisdiction to inspect and
arrest vessels in this area. By claiming that these are international
waters, Russia can also claim that an **[inspection and potential
subsequent arrest exceeds]{.underline}** Norway's **[authority in the
area, and in turn respond with a threat to use military
force.]{.underline}**

The North Pacific and Bering Sea

The Bering Sea comprises the maritime area south of **[the
Bering]{.underline}** Strait, where the **[US and Russia share a
maritime border. It is home to a range of marine species of significant
economic value]{.underline}**, many of which are vulnerable to climate
change. US-Russian relations in the Bering Sea, however, have been
difficult both historically and in recent years.

In the 1980s, the expansion of overfishing in the area prompted
negotiations between the former USSR and the US on both fisheries
relations and maritime boundaries. **[Constituting the most lucrative
fisheries in North America]{.underline}**, the pollock stock
subsequently collapsed in the early 1990s after a decade of overfishing
in the 'donut hole', a marine area not covered by an EEZ. In 2013, the
two countries issued a joint statement on strengthening US-Russian
cooperation in the Bering Sea. However, in recent years, tensions have
become more acute with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and
subsequent invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

**[Although both countries have continued operating emergency services
in the Bering Strait, and emergency cooperation here has continued, an
increased Russian military presence]{.underline}** and shifting stocks
due to climate change **[have wo]{.underline}**rried some US
**[fishers]{.underline}**. Further, Alaska's lucrative snow crab harvest
was cancelled this year for the first time ever due to stock collapse,
which scientists warn will become increasingly common with climate
change. As many species seek cooler, deeper waters, they are likely to
migrate beyond historical boundaries, with Russia already exploiting new
fishing locations within its EEZ.

#### Even a small-scale incident could escalate.

Shifting Strategic Relationships

In the near future, **[it is highly likely that]{.underline}**
**[strategic Arctic fisheries relations]{.underline}** **[will
become]{.underline}** more **[sensitive]{.underline}** for two reasons.
First, **[key species]{.underline}** -- depending on their mobility and
habitat connection -- **[are expected to respond to climate change by
shifting their distributions poleward]{.underline}** to cooler waters.
Indeed, in the Arctic, warming waters are causing some of the most
significant shifts in fish stocks globally, with this and declining
sea-ice coverage affecting fisheries and fishing patterns in key
locations. Second, **[the Barents Sea and Bering Sea will increasingly
play a role in strategic posturing, with NATO countries, Russia and even
China showcasing their Arctic capabilities.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[fisheries disputes]{.underline}** in the region **[are
increasingly becoming entangled in wider domestic]{.underline}** **[and
international politics]{.underline}**, **[with an impact on dynamics in
the maritime domain]{.underline}**. **[Rather than being a simple matter
of defining rights and ownership, when a maritime dispute reaches the
political agenda in this way, domestic actors may also seek to benefit
by infusing it with symbolic dimensions]{.underline}**, **[such as
'national pride']{.underline}** **[or 'being cheated out of what is
ours']{.underline}**. **[Such politicisation has become still more
relevant after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**.

**[Challenges emerge in the Arctic]{.underline}** context **[around the
unclear role of Russian fishing and research vessels, and the inherent
difficulties of monitoring and control at sea]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[the conflict potential emanating]{.underline}** **[from small-scale
incidents]{.underline}** related to both legitimate and illegal,
unregulated and unreported (IUU) **[fisheries in the Barents Sea is
greater now than it has been at any time]{.underline}** since the end of
the Cold War. Meanwhile, in the Bering Sea, increased Russian military
presence, as well as military cooperation between Russia and China, will
increasingly have an impact on the politicisation of fishing activities
and could muster a **[response from the US.]{.underline}**

1.1.1 Nuclear war

**[The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. However, even in an
all-out nuclear war between the United States and Russia, despite
horrific casualties, neither country's population is likely to be
completely destroyed by the direct effects of the blast, fire, and
radiation.8 The **[aftermath could be much worse: the burning of
flammable materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained global
cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- a nuclear
winter.]{.underline}**

According to one model 9 , an **[all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}**10 **[could lead to a drop in global temperatures
of around 8°C, making it impossible to grow food for 4 to 5
years]{.underline}**. **[This could leave some survivors in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the threat of extinction from other sources would be
great]{.underline}**. An **[exchange on this scale is only possible
between the US and Russia who have more than 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each,
although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that
**[even a small regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear weapons would
produce a nuclear winter serious enough to put two billion people at
risk of starvation]{.underline}**,12 though this estimate might be
pessimistic.13 Wars on this scale are unlikely to lead to outright human
extinction, but this does suggest that conflicts which are around an
order of magnitude larger may **[be likely to threaten
civilisation]{.underline}**. It should be emphasised that there is very
large uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global
climate. This remains an area where increased academic research work,
including more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of
how survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
existential risk from nuclear war over the next century, and existing
attempts leave very large confidence intervals. According to many
experts, the most likely nuclear war at present is between India and
Pakistan.14 However, given the relatively modest size of their arsenals,
the **[risk of human extinction is plausibly greater from a conflict
between the United States and Russia]{.underline}**. **[Tensions between
these countries have increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable
to rule out the possibility of them rising further in the
future]{.underline}**.

### Biodiversity Impact\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Arctic biodiversity is key to global biodiversity.

**[While often considered remote]{.underline}**, **[the Arctic plays a
large role]{.underline}** **[in the functioning of]{.underline}** many
**[global environmental]{.underline}** systems (Post et al. 2019;
Timmermans and Marshall 2020). In particular, **[the Arctic is involved
with the regulation of global climate]{.underline}** (McGuire et al.
2006) **[with important implications for the ongoing climate
crisis]{.underline}** (Díaz et al. 2019**[). While the Arctic may hold
less biodiversity than other biomes, this biome\'s biodiversity is
unique in that it includes more than 21 000 known species of fungi,
plants, and animals that are highly adapted to life in the cold and in
some cases could not survive without it]{.underline}** (see Fig. 1;
Callaghan et al. 2004; Payer et al. 2013; Ruth et al. 2023). These
adaptations come in many forms. For example, Arctic plants and
microorganisms have traits that make them tolerant to freezing, and
Arctic animals have developed various mechanisms such as fat storage
that allow them to tolerate frigid temperatures (Callaghan et al. 2004;
Guerrero and Rogers 2019). On a global scale, **[the Arctic is home to
27% of the world\'s marine mammal species]{.underline}** (Payer et al.
2013**[) and more than 20% of the world\'s lichenicolous fungi
species]{.underline}** (i.e., fungi that live on lichens; Dahlberg and
Bültmann 2013; Payer et al. 2013**[). The Arctic also provides habitat
for hundreds of species of birds that migrate to the Arctic from around
the globe to breed and forage]{.underline}** (Sullender 2019). **[There
is even diversity within Arctic sea ice where numerous bacteria,
viruses, algae, and sea ice infauna (e.g., ciliates, nematodes,
turbellarians, crustaceans) reside]{.underline}** (Bluhm et al. 2011;
Patrohay et al. 2022).

**[Civilization, and even the fate of our species, is utterly dependent
on proper global ecosystem functioning]{.underline}**. **[Ecosystem
functioning, including primary productivity, the biogeochemical cycles,
and the network of trophic mutualistic and antagonistic species
interactions that compose the food chains, is the fabric of life---a
fabric that is translated by humans as ecosystem services
(]{.underline}**e.g. \[28,39\]).

The vast literature on the biodiversity--ecosystem function relationship
and the significance thereof in terms of services to humanity has
focused its attention on the **[consequences of changes in the diversity
of (mostly) plant species or genetic variants on four major types of
ecological processes: (i) provisioning, such as crop yield, fodder
yield, wood production, medicines and medicine models; (ii) regulating,
such as biocontrol, pollination and nutrient cycling; (iii) support
services such as primary productivity; and (iv) cultural services, such
as inspiration, and education (see a classic review in]{.underline}**
\[40\]; also \[39\]). Biodiversity--ecosystem function studies focused
on animals are more limited, but some reviews make such relationship
evident too, including **[services such as crop pollination and pest
control, seed dispersal, litter decomposition, carbon cycling, carrion
and dung removal, soil erosion control, animal forage provisioning, and
zoonosis risk regulation]{.underline}** (see reviews in \[30,41\]). What
all this implies, in practical terms, is that the millions of years of
plant and phytoplankton cumulative photosynthesis; the tens of millions
of soil organisms that transform dirt into fertile soil, decompose the
bodies of dead organisms and contribute to nutrient recycling; the wild
and domesticated plants, animals (both terrestrial and aquatic) and
fungi that for millennia **[have fed and currently feed the human
population]{.underline}** (i.e. we all eat biodiversity); the
communities of animals that maintain plant reproduction and genetic
diversity, as well as those animals that **[regulate the abundance of
disease hosts and vectors;]{.underline}** the thousands of plants,
fungi, other microorganisms and animals that have provided and continue
to **[provide medicine or medicine models]{.underline}**; the
**[physical protection]{.underline}** due to ecosystem 'structures\'
such as mangroves and coral reefs **[from extreme weather
events]{.underline}**; and the increasingly appreciated significance of
the inspirational, educational and **[emotional benefit derived from our
contact with biodiversity constitute the life-support systems for
humanity]{.underline}** (see a recent review in \[18\]).

In a different perspective, ecosystem services have been examined in
economic terms (see a major review in \[42\]), and several researchers
have attempted to calculate the value of nature\'s services in a variety
of ways. Among these would be the cost of infrastructure that needs to
be developed to substitute for the services of, for example, protective
coastal ecosystems, and the price of water treatment plants that can
play the role of wetlands in filtering contaminants \[43\]. Similarly,
one estimate is that without mangroves flood damage in tropical coastal
areas would increase by more than 16% or \$US82 billion annually.
However, we emphasize that **[the fundamental value of ecosystems in the
intersection culture--ecosystem functioning lies in that the value of
our life-supporting systems 'is essentially incalculable']{.underline}**
\[18\].

This short review makes it evident that **[humanity cannot survive in
the absence of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning]{.underline}**,
which, as we have discussed above, we are increasingly degrading.
Furthermore, **[the prospect of Homo sapiens being present when the
normal recovery times following a mass extinction occur is simply
unrealistic.]{.underline}** Finally, it is imperative to appreciate that
all these aspects of human dependence on biodiversity---the intersection
between human culture and ecosystem services---occur at the level of the
populations of the myriad species and functional groups present where
human populations are present. Therefore, it is crucial that we examine
the impact of the human enterprise on the myriad populations of plants,
animals, fungi and microorganisms.

5\. Population declines and extinctions: the heart of the impending mass
extinction

We re-emphasize that **[the magnitude of the current extinction crisis
is underestimated owing to three key factors. First, the lack of
attention given to this existential threat]{.underline}** \[38\].
**[Second, most people, even many scientists, assume incorrectly that
the problem is primarily one of the disappearance of species when it is
in fact the existential threat of myriad population
extinctions]{.underline}** \[44\]. Third, while concerned scientists
know there are many individual and collective steps that must be taken
to slow the rate of population extinctions, only some advocate one
fundamental, necessary and 'simple' cure. That, of course, is reducing
the scale of the human enterprise \[38\].

#### Biodiversity loss is an [imminent existential threat]{.underline}.

**Pfingsten 23** -- Botanist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Program, former Conservation
Biologist at the Institute for Applied Ecology.

Ian Pfingsten, "Why Biodiversity?," Resilience, 01-30-2023,
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-01-30/why-biodiversity/

Last year I was invited to be interviewed for a new podcast called Here
to (T)here on the topic of biodiversity loss. **[The focus of our
discussion was around the importance of biodiversity and how this
sometimes ambiguous term relates to our ecology and our
survival]{.underline}**. Here **[I define biodiversity simply as the
richness and abundance of organisms assembled in a community across a
landscape]{.underline}**. The host was interested in the problems with
current economic reactions to ecological catastrophes and how a
participatory society might offer an alternative response.
Unfortunately, **[it shouldn't be controversial to prioritize
sustainability and survival of our species in light of the cliff we are
approaching with climate change and rapidly depleting
resources]{.underline}**.

**[But why should we care about biodiversity?]{.underline}** **[Because
we care about sustainability, which means we care about the health of
our families, communities, and future generations]{.underline}**. We
care about availability of clean water, nutritious food, and habitats
for us to live and play. And **[we care about diversity of life not only
because we believe life has intrinsic value and purpose, but because
living and decomposing organisms provide known and unknown functions
that benefit ecosystems (some call them ecosystem
services)]{.underline}**. **[The mangrove forests along our coastal
marshes provide protective buffers to rising waters]{.underline}** from
storm surges. **[The fungi in our soils absorb and break down
toxins]{.underline}** like heavy metals, chemicals, and even radiation.
**[Predators like cougars and wolves prevent stream bank
erosion]{.underline}** by controlling the herbivores that, if left
unchecked by predators, will overgraze soil-stabilizing plants. **[Even
mosquitoes have roles beyond transmitting diseases]{.underline}**; the
male mosquitoes never bite but drink nectar and move pollen in flowering
plants. **[We care about the services that an ecosystem provides through
the functions of its diverse community members]{.underline}**. **[We
therefore value sustaining an ecosystem that functions for our long-term
survival just as we value an economy and society that functions for the
well-being of all]{.underline}**.

**[Loss of biodiversity occurs when populations of organisms diminish to
such low abundance that they cannot recover]{.underline}**. **[The
rarest and most specialized organisms are the most at risk of
extinction]{.underline}** as their abundance and thus their genetic
diversity diminishes, like with the Florida Panther, where there isn't a
diverse enough gene pool to rescue the population from genetic disorders
due to inbreeding. Ecosystems and the community membership of different
organisms can change and usually do, but **[the rate of species loss we
are witnessing is far quicker than the fossil record indicates
as]{.underline}** typical or **[background loss of
biodiversity]{.underline}**. Instead **[the rate of biodiversity loss
suggests a pattern more like a mass extinction event]{.underline}**.

The causes of biodiversity loss are not controversial: greenhouse gasses
from fossil fuels and livestock production, pollution from industrial
waste, fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and gas leaks, desirable habitat
transformed into housing developments, agriculture and livestock fields,
and impounded rivers into reservoirs, irresponsible stewardship of
finite resources, and unintentional transfer of exotic plants and
animals that can disrupt ecosystems and economies; all of these examples
are economic externalities under capitalism and markets as well as
command economies.

Of course there is cynicism in how the guilty industries and their
contracted scientists absolve themselves of blame and distract the
affected from very real threats to sustainability. But there are also
many well-intentioned public and private organizations working
tirelessly to mitigate these problems. If those that care about
sustainability and biodiversity have the knowledge and means to mitigate
losses, then what are the mainstream answers to these problems? Do these
solutions reverse our fall to catastrophe or simply slow the descent?

Some mainstream solutions advocate stakeholder (instead of shareholder)
capitalism combined with regulatory policy to solve our problems. The
claim is that value can be achieved not just for the consumer and the
shareholder, but for the community and the planet. This runs counter to
current shareholder-focused, neoliberal economics, where stakeholders
are ignored due to non-shareholders lacking economic standing and the
environment lacking legal standing. With the conflicting interests of
stakeholders ultimately biased towards maximizing shareholder profits,
the market-driven trend is to keep business as usual with profits and
decision-making to the same sectors that provide the problems in the
first place. Under current practices, there is little debate whether we
prioritize the value of sustainability; the discussion instead is how to
keep the plane in nosedive as long as possible without acknowledging the
impending ground.

Too much carbon in the air? Monetize it in the market. Trade carbon
offsets and usage like commodities and stocks. And continue subsidizing
fossil fuel extraction above all.

Drinking water contaminated? Allow the polluting chemical industry to
write the regulations for themselves. Then put freshwater sources like
springs in the hands of food conglomerates like Nestlé.

Too much vegetation and algae in your lake or pond? Keep dumping
fertilizers on green deserts and single-crop agriculture fields that
drain into the water, and pay a company to spray herbicides multiple
times a year.

Not enough habitat for endangered plants and animals? Create artificial
habitats and preserves so that we can still build that single-family,
mini-mansion neighborhood in the prime real estate. Then charge a fee to
visit, fish, or hunt in the artificial habitats, which are either owned
by private companies or considered a corporate tax rebate after donating
the habitat to the public.

Despite the intentions of current economic practices and environmental
policies, they violate the value of self-management, that is your access
to making decisions proportional to the amount you are affected by those
decisions, which is crucial to empowering those most affected by
biodiversity loss. The public and private sectors create barriers to
decision-making using the current economic and political institutions.
Fundraisers for politicians and advocacy groups will gladly take
donations for well-intended causes, which basically means give them your
support and they will handle the tough decisions. At the 15th Conference
of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity that just concluded in Montreal, attendees and reporters
celebrated the inclusion of Indigenous, Tribal, and First Nation
representation at the meeting as if it was this gift to society from the
policy-makers instead of a victory from the protests for Indigenous
Rights during the convention. While little if any mention was made of
economic policy changes or condemnation of the previous policy of
Indigenous exclusion, the victory of Indigenous protesters is not to be
overlooked; they overcame the disempowerment and atomization that much
of the excluded majority feels and that keeps them from just voting for
their survival let alone organizing and contesting. In the words of
Greta Thunberg at the protest against creation of future coal mines in
Lutzerath, Germany, "when governments and corporations are destroying
the environment and putting people at risk, the people step up."

Why should we get more people to participate in environmental decisions
that affect them, and more importantly, how can we do this? This is a
reasonable response someone might have to the idea of including more
voices in decision making, especially in environmental policy. Are we
afraid of people making uninformed decisions that would do further harm
to our environments and our health? But then don't we already have that
problem now with market allocation? Why should we bother raising
awareness of sustainable practices if the people making the decisions
aren't listening? Is it in our best interests to rely on gatekeepers of
decision-making in governments, boards of directors, and academia
because they have more access to knowledge and empowering tasks? Why
can't ecological indicators be just as important as economic indicators
when someone buys a home, travels abroad, or visits a grocer. If we
value the potential of a child in our family just as a child from
another country, or value the liberation of co-workers just as workers
in another industry, can we likewise value the cleanliness of our water
just as the water from another continent?

I don't propose to know the best "hows" of getting more people to
participate or to include ecological indicators into prices. Presumptive
ecological value could be applied under the ecological precautionary
principle due to the fact that we do not understand or know all
ecosystem functions and services. Obviously we can't cease to function
in our economy and society due to never utilizing natural resources.
People will decide what is sustainably harvested and extracted, but with
the understanding and consideration of our ecological limits to
survival. How we do this will need to balance our needs for survival
above subsistence levels while working less and sharing our collective
resources.

I was invited to return for a follow-up panel discussion for the same
podcast episode. The panelists were asked what systemic changes and
practical steps are needed to address biodiversity loss. After providing
the rationale for a vision of participatory society, I explained how we
need to work on issues now with the aim of reaching that vision later.
In other words, we aren't getting the societal change we need in time to
stop the current trend towards multiple catastrophic tipping points in
climate change and biodiversity loss. Therefore we need timely reforms
to our current institutions, and not just modest reforms that promote
the same institutions, but vision-focused, "non-reformist" reforms that
lay foundations for new institutions.

A flexible strategy with the goal of winning non-reformist reforms has
the most potential for reaching the society we envision. Modest reforms
like carbon trading and offsets simply delay solving the emissions
problem and promote the institutions we want to replace such as markets
and capitalism. Instead, redistributing defense budgets to investments
in green infrastructure, research, and education would be non-reformist
in reducing militarism and promoting sustainability. A goal of promoting
social and environmental justice in education curricula would lay a
foundation of solidarity and sustainability for future generations by
teaching not just history of systemic racism, sexism, and imperialism,
but also ecological principles along with history of Indigenous heritage
and culture in public schools. We could push for infrastructure changes
that curtail personal vehicles by fighting for reforms that incentivize
investment in mass transit research, design, and construction. We could
nationalize the energy and agriculture sectors completely and replace
boards of directors and owners with neighborhood and worker
representatives from the community and agriculture and energy sectors.
This would be a substantial achievement towards eliminating capitalism's
influence on energy and food production as well as replacing
hierarchical state and corporate control of resource distribution. We
would likewise need to retrain an entire industry of workers towards
green energy production and sustainable agriculture while creating
strong unions in these green sectors and providing retirement for those
workers that don't want to learn new skills.

**[And what is there to do when these reforms fail to
pass]{.underline}** (or even be brought to a vote) **[in the
institutions we are provided?]{.underline}** **[We aren't going to get
far with current hierarchical institutions that create barriers to
sustainability through corporate influence in policies and
prioritization of profits]{.underline}**. **[Reliance on government
institutions, non-profits, politicians, and corporations is not a
rational strategy to avoid our immediate ecological
catastrophe]{.underline}**. We should encourage community and worker
empowerment to fight for new institutions where decisions are made by
those proportionally affected. This means those in privileged positions
in the sciences must share their research with the community and not shy
from denouncing capitalism, corporatism, and hierarchies of power in
private and public sectors. They must also risk their privileged
positions; they must strike, boycott, protest, write, call, speak,
demand, organize, and repeat as if the world depends on it.

The task at hand is not easy. There are people with more resources and
institutional power who want to maintain the status quo even if it is
harmful to their own interests. Yet, **[we are witnessing the very real
threats to our survival that will likely worsen if we stay the current
course]{.underline}**. **[These realities will be more difficult to
ignore as we approach each new tipping point towards ecological
collapse]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[the Earth will survive after the
sixth mass extinction event, but it will do so without us unless we care
enough to change]{.underline}**.

#### Biodiversity loss [causes extinction]{.underline} --- it's a [threat multiplier]{.underline} that jeopardizes the survival of [humans]{.underline} *and* [global ecosystems]{.underline}.

Climate Change," Future of Life Institute, 05-20-2016,

**[Catastrophic consequences for civilization.]{.underline}**

The **[consequences of]{.underline}** this rapid **[pruning of the
evolutionary tree of life extend beyond the obvious. There could be
surprising effects of biodiversity loss that scientists are unable to
fully anticipate in advance. For example, prior research has shown that
localized ecosystems can undergo abrupt and irreversible shifts when
they reach a tipping point. According to a 2012 paper published in
Nature, there are reasons for thinking that we may be approaching a
tipping point of this sort in the global ecosystem, beyond which the
consequences could be catastrophic for civilization.]{.underline}**

As the authors write, **[a planetary-scale transition could precipitate
"substantial losses of ecosystem services required to sustain the human
population."]{.underline}** **[An ecosystem service is any ecological
process that benefits humanity, such as food production and crop
pollination. If the global ecosystem were to cross a tipping point and
substantial ecosystem services were lost, the results could be
"widespread social unrest, economic instability, and loss of human
life."]{.underline}** According to Missouri Botanical Garden ecologist
Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors, **[this could occur in a
matter of decades---far more quickly than most of the expected
consequences of climate change, yet equally destructive.]{.underline}**

**[Biodiversity loss is a "threat multiplier" that, by pushing societies
to the brink of collapse, will exacerbate existing conflicts and
introduce entirely new struggles between state and non-state actors.
Indeed, it could even fuel the rise of terrorism.]{.underline}** (After
all, climate change has been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria,
and multiple high-ranking US officials, such as former US Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA director John Brennan, have affirmed that
climate change and terrorism are connected.)

The reality is that we are entering the sixth mass extinction in the
3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth, and the impact of this event
could be felt by civilization "in as little as three human lifetimes,"
as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the
**[widespread decline of biological populations could plausibly initiate
a dramatic transformation of the global ecosystem on an even faster
timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime.]{.underline}**

**[The unavoidable conclusion is that biodiversity loss constitutes an
existential threat in its own right.]{.underline}** As such, **[it
ought]{.underline}** to be considered alongside climate change and
nuclear weapons **[as one of the most significant contemporary risks to
human prosperity and survival.]{.underline}**

## REM Turn Answers

### REM Mining High\-\--2AC

#### REM mining in the Arctic is coming now. Thumps the turn.

**Evans 25** -- Contributor at Mine.

Scarlett Evans, "Mining in the Arctic: a rare earth 'cold rush'?," Mine,
02-03-2025,
https://mine.nridigital.com/mine_feb25/arctic-mining-rare-earths

**[Mining is not new to the Arctic region]{.underline}**. **[Alaska is
home to the largest zinc mine in the world and Sweden to the largest
iron ore mine in Europe]{.underline}**. However, high wages and strict
regulatory frameworks have been something of a deterrent to mining
companies' activity in the region as they typically want to extract as
much as possible with minimal overheads.

Short daylight hours and extreme cold have also proven to be a hurdle to
investors looking to build infrastructure in the Arctic, as well as
companies that must provide high wages to attract any kind of workforce.
The result is that the region's mineral potential has remained
relatively untapped despite its resources -- something the AEC, among
others, is looking to change.

**[With projections that critical minerals needs, including those for
REEs, are set to rise exponentially]{.underline}**, coupled with
mounting fears of an overreliance on rare earth superpower China, **[a
renewed spotlight is being put on the Arctic as a potential mining
hotspot.]{.underline}**

**[The minerals appeal of the Arctic]{.underline}**

"The Arctic region has three things that have always (and will always)
be exported," says Mads Qvist Frederiksen, executive director at AEC.
"Fish, energy and raw materials --- with the latter going back to the
1600s.

"**[Fast forward, and with the rise of industrialisation the world needs
more and more minerals as it needs more technologies, meaning the
Arctic\'s raw materials are getting renewed attention."]{.underline}**

Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency, **[demand for
critical minerals will nearly triple by 2030]{.underline}**, **[growing
to more than 3.5-times the current levels by 2050]{.underline}**.
**[This, alongside the fact that the Arctic is feeling the effects of
climate change more keenly than anywhere else -- warming four-times
faster]{.underline}** than the rest of the world, according to research
in Nature -- **[has given some urgency to the Arctic
focus.]{.underline}**

Currently, no REEs are mined in Europe, although the landscape is
shifting, and **[exploration of the Arctic has already proven it is home
to significant deposits of the materials]{.underline}**.

According to the Arctic Review, Greenland has enough reserves of
minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium to meet at least a quarter of
future global demand, around 38.5 million tonnes (mt).

Additionally, in 2023, Swedish miner LKAB made headlines by announcing
it had identified a REE deposit in Kiruna that exceeds 1mt of rare earth
oxides. The discovery was, briefly, the largest deposit of its kind in
Europe, before being overtaken in 2024 by Norway's Fen Carbonatite
Complex in Telemark.

While LKAB is still conducting research into the **[Kiruna
deposit]{.underline}**, the **[discovery adds to the perception of the
Nordic Arctic as a viable supply alternative to China]{.underline}** --
evidenced by Donald Trump's renewed mission to gain control of
Greenland's minerals.

### REM Mining High\-\--1AR

#### REM mining is high and coming now.

**Speed 25** -- Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for
Energy Studies, Professor of Energy Policy at the Centre for Energy,
Petroleum, and Mineral Law and Policy.

Philip Andrews-Speed, "Can the Arctic be a significant contributor of
critical minerals for the global energy transition?," The Arctic
Institute for Energy Studies, 02/2025,
https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SP36-Critical-Minerals-in-the-Arctic.pdf

**[The demand for critical minerals is rising in support of the
low-carbon energy transition]{.underline}**, as well as global economic
growth. Despite its hostile environment, **[the Arctic is a region with
historic and existing mineral production]{.underline}**. This paper
assesses the potential of the Arctic to make a significant contribution
to the future supply of critical minerals. It is one of the first,
possibly the first, attempt to do so at a pan-Arctic scale and with a
focus on critical minerals for the energy transition.

**[The mineral geology of the Arctic is not special]{.underline}**. The
particularities are the various physical and human geographic factors
that render the costs and timelines for mineral extraction from the
Arctic as significantly greater than that for many other parts of the
world.

**[The Arctic today accounts for more than 10 per cent of global
production for only three critical minerals: platinum, palladium, and
nickel.]{.underline}** Other Arctic-sourced critical minerals in smaller
quantities include silver, copper, and cobalt. **[The Arctic also
provides more than 10% of global supplies of by-products such as
tellurium and selenium]{.underline}**. The contribution of the Arctic to
mineral ore production pales when compared to the Democratic Republic of
Congo that provides 74% of the world's cobalt, China that provides 77%
of the natural graphite and Chile that provides 48% of the lithium ore.

Most new **[production]{.underline}** that is to **[come online between
now and 2034]{.underline}** is likely to be from already proven mineral
reserves, or from areas adjacent to existing known deposits. **[Given
the scale of the Arctic's current mining operations and the need to
boost mineral production and exports, it is possible that]{.underline}**
the **[major growth of production between now and 2034]{.underline}**
will be in Russia. **[Exploration and feasibility studies in the Arctic
regions of other countries will certainly identify new reserves and
potential mining operations]{.underline}**. However, it is likely that
few of these will add significantly to the Arctic's share of the global
supply of critical minerals in the next 10 years. That being said, they
may start to provide additional sources of the supply of critical
mineral ores for Western Europe and North America.

**[Attempts by governments to gain access to critical raw materials in
the Arctic, such as lithium and nickel, are expected to exacerbate

National Intelligence Council, in a new report.

**[Countries are increasingly competing to control

tensions is likely to require adapting existing forums or creating new
ones to address bilateral and multilateral security concerns among
states.

### REM Mining Safe\-\--2AC

#### Arctic REM mining is good and is becoming increasingly safe.

**Frederiksen 23** -- Executive Director of the Arctic Economic Council.

Mads Qvist Frederiksen, "If we want an energy transition, we must have
more mining," Arctic Economic Council,
https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/news/if-we-want-an-energy-transition-we-must-have-more-mining/

**[All across the Arctic,]{.underline}** the local **[communities have
for centuries been involved in the mining sector]{.underline}**. **[The
region has been mined throughout history]{.underline}** to attain the
building blocks for a more modern and developed civilisation globally.
Yet, people's understanding of the importance of mining has decreased
over time as new mines have been placed in remote and distant locations
with different regulatory frameworks than in the Arctic. However, **[now
the world needs Arctic mining again because the region has many of the
raw materials needed in the green transition and in places with fair and
transparent jurisdictions.]{.underline}**

**[Politicians are awaking to the need of mining for a clean and greener
future]{.underline}**

In early March 2023, the European Union (EU) published their new
Critical Raw Materials (CRM) Act. It may not have made a lot of
headlines around the world, but it is important for industries, remote
Arctic communities, and the wider population.

The president of the European Commission Ursula de Leyden highlighted
the importance of mining at the beginning of the year when she said:

"The economies of the future will no longer rely on oil and coal, but on
lithium for batteries; on silicon metal for chips; on rare earth
permanent magnets for electric vehicles and wind turbines. And it is
sure: the **[green and digital transitions will massively increase our
need for these materials."]{.underline}**

Some analysts even argue that the opening of the first EU office in
Nuuk, Greenland is related to Europe waking up to its need for new
sources of raw materials.

Simultaneously in the US, President **[Biden]{.underline}** earlier
**[announced an increase in the development of green
technologies]{.underline}**. The new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) also
includes large tax breaks for mining companies that can produce the
required critical raw materials. Last year, the US also launched a \$30
million initiative to research and secure the supply chain of domestic
raw materials.

Both the EU and the USA have recognised that they risk simply replacing
fossil fuel dependency to mineral dependency from authoritarian states
if they don't act now.

China -- who today is processing most of the world's raw materials and
thus holds a competitive advantage, is also moving into new mining
regions such as Madagascar and deep-sea mining off the coast of
Mozambique. Some Chinese companies have also shown an interest in mining
projects throughout the Arctic region.

**[Mining has become an issue of security]{.underline}** **[but it is
also just as much about the future of planetary health]{.underline}**;
**[the unavoidable fact is that our sustainable future begins deep
underground in a mine]{.underline}**. Yet, there were no references to
mining in the most recent report of the International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC).

**[We cannot afford to slow down with mining]{.underline}**. It is clear
that **[we are going to need a vast amount of green energy in the
future, and for that, we will need a vast amount of critical
minerals.]{.underline}**

In the coming two decades, **[we will require a 500% increase in the
production of lithium and graphite]{.underline}** in order to meet
demand. Some people estimate **[that our activity will necessitate the
opening of more than 330 new mines in the near future]{.underline}**,
and with one mine normally taking more than 15 years to become
operational, **[we have no time to waste.]{.underline}**

We need to invest more in new mining projects

Today's mineral supply and investment plans fall short of what is needed
to transform our energy sector. A growing and more resource-hungry
population means larger quantities of CO2 emissions unless we are able
to change our basic technologies.

If you want to build a battery to store energy, you need lithium,
nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite to ensure high performance,
longevity and, energy density.

If you want to expand your electricity network, you need copper and
aluminium.

If you want to build permanent magnets that are used in wind turbines
and electric vehicles, you need rare earth elements.

In 2019, Finnish geologist Simon Michaux estimated that the world has to
increase the production of several raw materials several times, above
all total historical production to date, to reach our climate ambitions.
Therefore recycling will not take us all the way.

A typical electric car requires six times more mineral inputs than a
conventional car, and an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more
minerals than a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. Since 2010, the
average amount of minerals required for a new unit of power generation
capacity has increased by 50%.

It is also the critical raw materials which we need in our satellites,
computers, and connectivity infrastructure. The defence industry also
needs the minerals that we are currently sourcing from authoritarian
states. Each F-35 jet contains more than 400 kilos of yttrium, terbium,
and other rare earth elements. Nuclear reactors and lasers use samarium,
missile guidance systems need neodymium, night vision goggles need
lanthanum, etc. In the autumn of 2022, the Pentagon temporarily halted
deliveries of F-35 jets after discovering that the raw materials used
for a magnet had been made with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China.
As such, they had to find a place closer to home in their supply chain.
Today, the majority of rare earth mining, refining, and processing takes
place in China.

In 2010, China and Japan entered a trade dispute when the former
suddenly halted all shipments of rare earth elements to Japan. The
dispute began when the Chinese government reduced its export quotas by
40% which resulted in import prices rising quickly. China argued that
this decision was made to protect the environment, but the West called
it protectionism in disguise. The dispute was later resolved in the WTO,
but it caused western governments to begin looking outside of China for
rare earth elements.

For the climate, for security, and for jobs

As we can see, **[we must diversify our raw materials supply and develop
mining operations in new places, instead of outsourcing to developing
countries]{.underline}**. The Arctic region contains many of the
minerals that are currently mined elsewhere, even though the quality of
the ore could possibly be better in the north.

**[We cannot get anywhere close to the quantity of required raw
materials in a sustainable manner unless developed countries are also
pursuing mining opportunities.]{.underline}**

**[The good news is that there is growing consumer demand for more
supply chain transparency]{.underline}**, **[tighter environmental
regulations]{.underline}**, **[and labour rights. This, combined with
the strategic importance, may lead to more mining in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. The first obstacle to overcome is the idea of
"NIMBY -- not in my backyard" or "Green colonialism" which some interest
groups are promoting. Some of the interest groups don't even live in the
front yard of the Arctic but believe that the region should be kept
separate from wider global development.

**[Commercial mining in the Arctic began several centuries
ago]{.underline}** in Finland and Sweden**[, but it was the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries that saw the development of large-scale mines
for metals such as iron copper, nickel, gold, tin, lead and
zinc.]{.underline}** Many of these mines closed in the second half of
the twentieth century as the internationalisation of the mining industry
rendered them uneconomic. The Arctic is relatively unexplored for many
critical minerals as its physical remoteness and its harsh environment
present technological challenges and resultedly high production costs.
However, **[the scale of future demand has triggered moves to assess the
potential for increased exploitation of critical minerals in this
region]{.underline}**. Since 2023, several national governments in the
region have launched strategies to assess and develop critical mineral
resources in their Arctic regions.

**[The first step to mitigating climate change and its security
challenges is reaching zero-net carbon emissions]{.underline}** by 2050,
an international goal established in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
**[To do so requires massive global investment in green technologies,
which will escalate requirements for non-carbon-emitting sources of
electricity]{.underline}** and energy storage. A recent World Bank
report **[projects increases in demand "up to nearly 500 percent for
certain minerals]{.underline}**, especially those concentrated in energy
storage technologies, such as lithium, graphite, and cobalt."\[36\]

**[Green energy technologies rely heavily on components constructed of a
range of mine]{.underline}**rals that primarily reside near the bottom
of the periodic table of elements. These 17 rare earth elements exist in
deposits globally, with 75 percent concentrated in the Indo-Pacific
region; however, contrary to what their name implies, rare earth
elements are not rare, just complicated to extract and expensive to
refine.\[37\]

**[To keep atmospheric temperatures below a 2-degree Celsius increase,
investment in green technology will drive global rare earth element
demand to an estimated 3.1 billion tons annually by 2050]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, estimates predict demand will rise to 3.5 billion tons
annually to prevent global warming from exceeding 2 degrees
Celsius.\[38\] The U.S. defense industry amplifies rare earth element
demand far beyond global green energy, which further complicates
strategic implications. For instance, the U.S. requires about 940 pounds
of REEs to produce an F-35 strike fighter, 5200 pounds for each Aegis
destroyer, and nearly 9200 pounds for a Virginia-class submarine.\[39\]
As demand surges, supply chain security becomes an increasingly crucial
strategic issue for the U.S. as China controls approximately 85 percent
of global supply of rare earth elements.\[40\]

https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1731.html

Although **[there is no doubt that the Arctic contains vast economic
potential for Russia]{.underline}** and others, **[there are some
important reasons why this factor, on its own, is unlikely to diminish
Russia's cooperation]{.underline}** with its Arctic neighbors. Potential
for high global energy prices, along with the development **[of the
necessary infrastructure and access to extraction technologies, will be
instrumental in determining the magnitude of impact from this
fact]{.underline}**or. In addition, **[Russia's]{.underline}** natural
gas, oil, minerals, **[fish stocks]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
other **[resources]{.underline}** **[are not under any major threat,
real or perceived]{.underline}**, **[from inside or outside the
Arctic.]{.underline}** Other than the upcoming CLCS decision we will
discuss next, **[there are no major territorial disputes between Russia
and its Arctic neighbors in which there might be substantial resources
at stake]{.underline}**. **[Even if Russia is not successful in its bid
for certain contested areas of the Arctic Ocean seabed, it has other
hydrocarbon resources within its EEZ that can be
developed]{.underline}**. For example, **[only about 20 percent of the
Barents Sea and 15 percent of the Kara Sea have been
explored]{.underline}**; the East Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, and the
portion of the Chukchi Sea off the Russian coast have not been explored
at all.32 In the Barents and Kara seas, approximately 430 million tons
of oil and 8.5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas have been discovered
on the Russian continental shelf but are yet to be developed.33

**[It could be argued that tensions around resources may come from
non-Arctic nations.]{.underline}** China, in particular, has shown an
interest in Arctic resources. **[However]{.underline}**, Russia has
carefully made China a partner, not an adversary, in Arctic resource
extraction. For example, the **[countries]{.underline}** are
collaborating in efforts to extract natural gas from the Yamal
Peninsula. Further, Russia and China **[appear poised to collaborate,
rather than compete]{.underline}**, when it comes to mining **[because
it could give them a strategic advantage in]{.underline}** controlling
rare-earth metals that the United States and other developed countries
desperately need for a large number of industries.34 The Arctic Coastal
states, including Russia, have also involved China in discussions about
prohibiting commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas, clearly
acknowledging its Arctic interests and attempting to secure its
compliance with the regulation in so doing.

**[Destabilizing the region could]{.underline}** also **[limit Russia's
potential to benefit from its Arctic resources]{.underline}**, **[which
its national priorities clearly indicate it wishes to do]{.underline}**.
**[The difficulty of resource exploration and exploitation in this
harsh]{.underline}**, **[remote region hugely complicates the road to
profitability]{.underline}**,35 **[let alone if a conflict were to put
at risk personnel, ships, infrastructure, and sea lanes needed to
support these activities and bring resources to global
markets]{.underline}**. Further, **[Russia has long been dependent on
western technology for oil and gas exploitation]{.underline}**. If
sanctions remain in place and western companies advance offshore
drilling technology, Russia's access to these innovations may be delayed
or prevented altogether, limiting the nation's ability to economically
exploit some of its offshore energy reserves.36

have to," Oceana, 08-05-2018,
https://oceana.org/blog/climate-change-could-ignite-fish-wars-it-doesnt-have/

**[Countries will learn to share quickly]{.underline}**, or fight.

"When fish move across political boundaries, we're not good at sharing
initially, or even for decades," said Malin Pinsky, an ecologist at
Rutgers University in New Jersey and Oceana science advisor, who led the
recent study. "That causes conflict to erupt."

**[Fights over fisheries are nothing new. French scallop fishermen
lobbed rocks and smoke bombs at British boats off the Coast of Normandy
last month: the latest in their 15-year battle over
scallops]{.underline}** (with tensions dating back at least 200 years).
**[Iceland, Norway and the European Union have such bad blood over
mackerel that Iceland withdrew its bid to join the EU in 2015. The
United States and Canada are forever beefing over cod]{.underline}**.
But the speed and scale of change this century is unprecedented, experts
say, and could have resounding political and environmental aftershocks.

"These problems might start in fisheries, but they often spill out
beyond fisheries as well," Pinsky said. Bickering about fish has been a
top cause of armed conflict since World War II. Consider the
headline-making row between French and British fishermen last month,
whose anger boiled down to disagreement about who can fish where. It's a
spark that can ignite militarization when maritime borders are poorly
defined, and countries are competing for a limited resource, according
to one analysis.

If those countries get grabby, they can overexploit the fishery. Imagine
two people facing a delicious piece of cake, Pinsky said, each
suspicious that the other won't share. Both will lunge and "eat as much
as they can, quickly," he explained. "In some ways, that's what's
happening with fish."

Future feuds seem likely, but **[fish wars aren't
guaranteed]{.underline}**. L**[ooking across countries that have shared
well in the past, and countries that haven't, patterns of good behavior
do emerge]{.underline}**. **[Trust, cooperation and smart planning point
the way to]{.underline}** a **[less conflict]{.underline}**ed future.

Build trust early

Sharing seems like standard good behavior. **[Indeed, people --- and
governments --- can be great sharers]{.underline}**, with a little time
to warm up to the idea.

**[Consider the Pacific island nations of Kiribati, the Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and
the Federated States of Micronesia: eight tiny countries that
cooperatively manage the largest tuna fishery in the
world]{.underline}**. "**[They've built trust amongst each other over 30
years]{.underline}**," said Kate Barclay, a marine social scientist at
Australia's University of Technology Sydney.

Trust pays dividends in a complex cap-and-trade scheme for the region's
skipjack tuna. It works like this: Every year, all eight countries agree
how many days, total, commercial skipjack fishing will be allowed in all
their waters. That's the whole pie, of which each country gets a slice
--- an allocation of days, which they can sell to foreign vessels for
single-day fishing access, typically at a cost of \$10,000 to \$14,000
each, said lawyer Transform Aqorau, who pioneered the management system.

Trust comes into play because skipjack tuna don't hang out around every
island every year, meaning some countries will sell out of fishing days,
while others won't. In this system, the islands that sell out of days
first just buy unused days from their neighbors. So even though the fish
are unevenly spread in the water, everyone profits.

"**[There's been a great appreciation for a long time, by these small
island nations, that they need to work together to achieve their mutual
ends]{.underline}**," said fisheries scientist Johann Bell of the
University of Wollongong, Australia, and of Conservation International.
Licensing fees paid by foreign fleets can account for as much as 80
percent of government revenue, he explained, "so they've got a huge
stake in this."

And because there's a cap on fishing days available --- the whole pie
for all the islands --- skipjack aren't overfished. **[Of course, there
is some quibbling between countries over their allocation of days,
Aqorau said, but overall, it's a successful system.]{.underline}**

More countries will confront the question of sharing this century. The
Pacific Islands are managing well, because they built trust early. At
the broadest level, Rutgers' Pinsky said, avoiding fish wars "is about
building trust before there's a crisis."

Don't benefit at a neighbor's expense

Knowing that skipjack migrate, "the Pacific Islands could have said OK,
well it's the luck of the draw, boys," Bell said. "If it's in your
country you make a lot of money that year. If not, you don't."

Instead, **[small neighboring nations worked together to their mutual
gain.]{.underline}**

**[Thousands of miles north, in the considerably colder waters of the
Barents Sea, Russia and Norway cooperatively manage another migratory
fish: cod. While cod may be the poster child of overfishing in North
America, it's thriving across the Atlantic.]{.underline}**

Barents management worked where North America's failed, because Russia
and Norway follow science-based catch limits set by a joint fisheries
commission, wrote biologist John Waldman of Queens College New York, in
Yale 360. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, managed cod
independently in most places. The two countries just lunged for it.

Today in the Barents Sea, whether cod fishermen are Russian or
Norwegian, they're free to fish off either country. When cod migrate,
fishermen can follow. Neighbors don't shut each other out to get ahead.

**[Common decency may seem motivation enough]{.underline}**, but
altruism isn't necessarily a good foundation for policy, points out
sustainability scientist Jessica Spijkers, a co-author of the recent
Science study and doctoral student with the Stockholm Resilience Center
and James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. Selfless ideals
don't hold up well, she said, when a country's people are desperate, or
in crisis.

**[For Norway, Russia and the Pacific Islands, playing nice benefits
their neighbors. But more importantly, cooperation benefits themselves,
more than going it alone. Lofty ideals might bring some countries to the
table, but self-interest keeps them there]{.underline}**. It's when
neighbors feel stepped on that sharing breaks down.

https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/05/08/stepped-us-military-aid-doesnt-equal-us-russia-war

Q: **[The U.S. and its NATO allies have attempted to strike a balance
between aiding Ukraine while not instigating a direct conflict with
Russia]{.underline}**. Have they succeeded?

D\'Anieri: **[The western allies have struck this balance quite
effectively]{.underline}**, **[and Ukraine has generally cooperated by
not attacking Russia as much as it could]{.underline}**. However,
difficult decisions are ahead, in particular to the extent that Ukraine
needs more and better weapons to expel Russia. A second challenge will
arise if and when Ukraine is able to take back Crimea. It seems that
Crimea is more important to Putin than other Ukrainian territory.

Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?

D\'Anieri: **[No]{.underline}**. **[There is a big gap]{.underline}**,
**[well-understood on all sides]{.underline}**, **[between arming an
ally and directly engaging with Russia]{.underline}**. **[There were
many parallel examples during the Cold War]{.underline}** when the U.S.
and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies without directly
getting involved, **[and while this didn't always make the other side
happy, it was never seen as direct attack.]{.underline}** In fact,
**[the U.S. and Russian militaries have for decades been very careful to
avoid directly shooting at one another, for fear of where it might
end.]{.underline}**

Q: **[Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline}**

D\'Anieri: **[No]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. has not attacked Russia and
Russia has not attacked the U.S., and neither of those things is even
remotely likely at this point.]{.underline}**

Q: What is the price of Russian military strikes on U.S. soil? Is there
a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?

D\'Anieri: **[Such an attack must be regarded as extremely
unlikely]{.underline}**. **[If such an attack were to take place, the
U.S. would likely seek to respond in a way that is proportional but not
escalatory]{.underline}**. Uncertainty about what would lead to
escalation explains why **[the U.S. and Russia take such care to avoid
direct combat]{.underline}**, even as they support competing sides in
some conflicts.

Russia has sought to intervene in U.S. elections in the past, and likely
will continue to do so. One might also expect cyber attacks, but we have
not seen them thus far in this war. That suggests the **[Russians
understand that they too are vulnerable]{.underline}**. It is also quite
likely that with Russian forces already overextended fighting against
Ukraine, **[Russian leaders realize that a second major conflict is not
in their interest]{.underline}**.

to ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," Futures, Vol. 102, p. 39-50

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this]{.underline}** particular 0.001% annual loss **[is a
threshold---and it is hard to imagine any data that would allow one to
identify where the threshold was]{.underline}** (Brook, Ellis, Perring,
Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams, 2013). **[A better
question is whether one can imagine any scenario by which the loss of
too many species leads to the collapse of societies and environmental
disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute number of
extinctions]{.underline}** that would be required to create this
dystopia. **[While there are data that relate local
reductions]{.underline}** in species richness **[to altered ecosystem
function, these results do not point to substantial existential risks.
The data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced]{.underline}** as species numbers decline
locally (Vellend, 2017), **[or are local observations]{.underline}** of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential risks. To make
the link even more tenuous, there is little evidence that biodiversity
is even declining at local scales]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
2017). **[Total planetary biodiversity may be in decline, but local and
regional biodiversity is often staying the same because species from
elsewhere replace local losses]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the
world in the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists
are likely to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism
regarding the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss
to an existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend,
2014). **[Obviously if all biodiversity disappeared civilization would
end---but no one is forecasting the loss of all species. It seems
plausible that the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be
apocalyptic, but no]{.underline}**t **[one is predicting that degree of
biodiversity loss either]{.underline}**. Tragic, but plausible is the
possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as many as half of its
species. **[If global biodiversity were halved]{.underline}**, but at
the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
**[what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** Extinctions and
**[biodiversity loss are ethical and spiritual losses, but perhaps not
an existential risk]{.underline}**.

Can you **[explain]{.underline}** what **[the mechanism]{.underline}**
is **[whereby biodiversity loss creates existential risk?]{.underline}**
And if biodiversity loss is an existential risk, how big a risk is it?
Should 80k be getting people to go into conservation science or not?

There are independent reasons to think that the risk is negligible.
Firstly, according to wikipedia, **[during the Eocene
period]{.underline}** \~65m years ago, **[there were thousands fewer
genera than today]{.underline}**. **[We]{.underline}** have **[made \~1%
of species extinct, and we would have to continue]{.underline}** at
**[current rates of species extinctions for at least 200 years to return
to Eocene levels of biodiversity]{.underline}**. And yet, even though
significantly warmer than today, **[the Eocene marked the dawn of
thousands of new species]{.underline}**. So, **[why would]{.underline}**
we expect **[the world 200 years hence]{.underline}** to **[be
inhospitable to humans if it wasn\'t inhospitable for]{.underline}** all
of the **[species]{.underline}** emerging **[in the Eocene,
who]{.underline}** are/**[were significantly less numerous than humans
and significantly less capable of a rational response to
problems?]{.underline}**

Secondly, as far as I am aware, evidence for pressure-induced non-linear
ecosystem shifts is very limited. This is true for a range of
ecosystems. Linear ecosystem damage seems to be the norm. If so, this
leaves more scope for learning about the costs of our damage to
ecosystems and correcting any damage we have done.

Thirdly, **[ecosystem services are]{.underline}** overwhelmingly **[a
function]{.underline}** of the relations **[within local ecosystems,
rather than of global]{.underline}** trends in
**[biodiversity]{.underline}**. Upon discovering Hawaii, the Polynesians
eliminated so many species that global decadal extinction rates would
have been exceptional. This has next to no bearing on ecosystem services
outside Hawaii. **[Humanity]{.underline}** is an intelligent species and
**[will be able to see]{.underline}** if **[other regions]{.underline}**
are **[suffering from biodiversity loss and make adjustments
accordingly]{.underline}**. Why would all regions be so stupid as to
ignore lessons from elsewhere? Also, is biodiversity actually decreasing
in the rich world? I know forest cover is increasing in many places.
Population is set to decline in many rich countries in the near future,
and environmental impact per person is declining on many metrics.

I also find it surprising that you cite **[the Kareiva and Carranza
paper]{.underline}** in **[support]{.underline}** of your
**[claims]{.underline}**, for this paper in fact directly contradicts
them:

\"The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds

#### Adaptation solves.

Conservation in an Age of Mass Extinction, "Could Biodiversity
Destruction Lead to a Global Tipping Point?," The Guardian, 1/26/18,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jan/16/biodiversity-extinction-tipping-point-planetary-boundary

**[Just over 250 million years ago]{.underline}**, the planet suffered
what may be described as its greatest holocaust: **[ninety-six percent
of marine genera]{.underline}** (plural of genus) **[and seventy percent
of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects suffered a mass
extinction]{.underline}** -- the only time before or since. **[Entire
classes of animals]{.underline}** -- like trilobites -- **[went out like
a match in the wind.]{.underline}**

**[But what's arguably most fascinating about]{.underline}** this event
-- known as **[the Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline}** or more
poetically, the Great Dying -- **[is the fact that anything survived at
all. Life]{.underline}**, it seems, **[is so ridiculously adaptable that
not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off
nearly everything]{.underline}** (no one knows for certain though
theories abound) **[but]{.underline}**, somehow, **[after millions of
years life even recovered and went on to write new tales.]{.underline}**

**[Even as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of
life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term.]{.underline}** The
lessons of such **[mass extinctions]{.underline}** -- five to date and
arguably a sixth happening as I write -- **[inform science
today]{.underline}**. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000
(some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long
worried about our current destruction of biodiversity -- and what that
may mean for our future Earth and ourselves.

In 2009, **[a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet]{.underline}** that if passed could theoretically push the
Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global
boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification
and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated
the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

**["It makes no sense that there exists a tipping point of biodiversity
loss beyond which the Earth will collapse,"]{.underline}** said
co-author and ecologist, José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in
France. "**[There is no rationale for this."]{.underline}**

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that **[there isn't evidence of a point
at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even
locally. If the planet didn't collapse after the Permian-Triassic
extinction event, it won't collapse now]{.underline}** -- though our
descendants may well curse us for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
**[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge.
Ecosystems]{.underline}**, according to them, **[slowly degrade but
never fail outright.]{.underline}**

**["Of more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various
functions, none showed a collapse,"]{.underline}** Montoya said. "In
general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem
functions\...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality,
plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species.
**[But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which
functions collapse."]{.underline}**

#### No food or resources internal link.

Sarah **Cliffe 16**, Director of the Center on International Cooperation

However, [current research **does not**]{.underline} yet [indicate a
clear link between]{.underline} climate change, [food insecurity and
conflict]{.underline}, except perhaps where rapidly deteriorating water
availability cuts across existing tensions and weak institutions. But a
series of interlinked problems -- changing global patterns of
consumption of energy and scarce resources, increasing demands for food
imports (which draw on land, water, and energy inputs) can create
pressure on fragile situations.

[Food security -- and food prices -- are a highly political
issue]{.underline}, being a very immediate and visible source of popular
welfare or popular uncertainty. [But their **link to
conflict**]{.underline} (and the wider links between climate change and
conflict) [is indirect]{.underline} rather than direct.

What makes some countries more resilient than others?

[**Many** countries face food price or natural resource shocks **without
falling into conflict**]{.underline}. Essentially, the two important
[factors]{.underline} in [determining their resilience are]{.underline}:

First, [whether food insecurity is combined with **other
stresses**]{.underline} -- issues such as unemployment, but most
fundamentally issues such as political exclusion or human rights abuses.
[We sometimes read]{.underline} nowadays that the 2006-2009 [drought was
a factor in the Syrian conflict,]{.underline} by driving rural-urban
migration that caused societal stresses. It may of course have been one
factor amongst many but [it would be **too simplistic** to
suggest]{.underline} that [it was the primary driver]{.underline} of the
Syrian conflict.

Second, [whether countries have strong enough institutions]{.underline}
to fulfill a social compact with their citizens, [providing help quickly
to citizens affected by food insecurity]{.underline}, with or without
international assistance. [During the]{.underline} 2007-20[08 food
crisis, developing countries with low institutional strength experienced
more food price protests]{.underline} than those with higher
institutional strengths, and more than half these protests turned
violent. [This]{.underline} for example, [is the difference in the
events in Haiti versus]{.underline} those in [**Mexico or the
Philippines** where far greater institutional strength existed to deal
with the food price shocks and **protests did not spur deteriorating
national security** or widespread violence]{.underline}.
