# Cap K- GDS 2025 

# Summary

**The Shell**

The Capitalism Kritik shell argues that the affirmative supports a
larger system of capitalist and neocolonial domination. The link card
says U.S. Arctic policy pretends to be about cooperation and
sustainability but really focuses on economic growth and military
control. This continues a long pattern of using security as an excuse to
dominate Arctic land and resources---often ignoring Indigenous rights
and voices, while propping up capitalism modes of production. The impact
card starts that capitalism itself makes global problems worse---it
drives climate change, endless wars, and even the threat of nuclear
disaster, all in the name of growth and profit. The alternative to this
Kritik is to use historical materialism to dismantle capitalism. The
argument is that capitalism survives not just by exploiting workers, but
also by stealing from nature and marginalized communities. Arctic
development is part of that system---it turns Indigenous land and
ecosystems into tools for profit. Indigenous resistance to pipelines and
extraction should be seen as part of a larger struggle against this
system.

**Ways to make it your own**

This K has many different link options depending on the affirmative you
might hear. There is also an extensive crossover between anti-capitalist
literature and settler colonialism literature, meaning with a couple of
tweaks this could turn into more of a Set Col K (though you might need a
new alternative). If you are more interested in keeping this a pure Cap
K- but HM isn't your favorite alt- you could use your favorite anti-cap
alt easily. HM was chosen due to the amount of literature it had
specific to exploring and developing the Arctic.

**Aff Answers**

The perm story is that Arctic Development can be done in a way that
benefits all parties involved, and on face is just better than a
complete rejection of Capitalism. This paired with the impact turns of
transition wars, and alt failures due to economic collapse will be a
pertinent point of contention against the K.

[[This thesis investigates the United State's interests in the Arctic
region as it has transitioned into a large Arctic region player over the
past few decades. As climate change opens up the Arctic region, more
international players have entered the region. However, the increased
international spotlight has led to heightened tensions in the
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} Geopolitical tensions and expanding
economic opportunities are driving states to issue strategies concerning
their position and interests in the Arctic region. Many scholars and
researchers have criticized the U.S. for its sudden involvement in the
region, prompting questions regarding its sincerity and underlying
interests in the region. This study conducts a two-part discourse
analysis to compare the formally stated interests of the U.S. Arctic
Policies with the underlying discourse and interests expressed by U.S.
political actors in their statements about the Arctic, Alaska, and
Greenland. The analysis covers the period from 2009 to the beginning of
2023. [[The discourse findings are analyzed under the theoretical
framework of neocolonialism, capitalism, and human securitization
theory. The main finding is that the U.S. Arctic Policies' strategies
and interests differ from the discourse of U.S. political actors, with
economic opportunities and military security being the main interests of
the U.S. in the Arctic region.]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Arctic
interests are more concerned with domestic priorities than foreign ones.
[[As U.S. Arctic interests are driven by neocolonialism motives and
capitalistic behaviors, the human security of non-state actors in the
Arctic is hindered, such as the Arctic Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. focuses more on the human
security of Alaskan natives than other Arctic States' Indigenous
peoples. The U.S. Arctic Policies are published to ameliorate its
reputation, as all the U.S. Arctic interests are based on U.S.
securitization, not cooperation. [[Concluding that the U.S.'s Arctic
Policy priorities do not align with the interests found within the U.S.
political actors' discourse about the Arctic. Suggesting that the U.S.
has underlying interests in the region that promotes its priorities over
being an Arctic ally.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Impact: Capitalism is an existential risk multiplier AND causes extinction independently through climate, militarism, and nuke war.

[As [people are dying for capitalism]{.mark} in the sense that they want
ever more of it, they are also literally dying for the consequences of
craving [a literal death system]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[The "triangle
of extinction]{.mark}**"]{.underline} exposes what many on the left have
suspected but never fully understood. **[[U.S. capitalism fuels both
climate change and militarism for five]{.mark} core
[reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [1) [elevating profit over all other
aims]{.mark}; 2) [commitment to unfettered]{.mark} economic
[growth]{.mark}; 3) [expanding]{.mark} to [control]{.mark} markets and
resources [domestically and internationally]{.mark}; 4) [producing
commodities]{.mark} for sale on the market [rather than public
goods]{.mark}; [and]{.mark} 5) [concentrating political power
among]{.mark} corporate elites, notably [the military-industrial complex
and the carbon-industrial complex]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[All of these
forces]{.mark} [lead]{.mark}** capitalist [**elites and the market**
**to ignore**]{.mark} the **[existential risks]{.mark}** [and treat them
as]{.mark}]{.underline} what economists call
"[[externalities]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- which include the ultimate
costs externalized from producers and paid by the general public.¶ How
[climate and military threats fuel each other]{.underline} is a major
neglected subject. Ironically, [the Pentagon]{.underline} itself
annually [reports that climate change is the biggest national security
threat]{.underline}, with environmental disasters and sea rise driving
people from endangered residences toward inhabitable land. Such
[migrations --- along with intensifying floods, droughts and extreme
temperatures --- set up violent competition among people desperate for
land and resources]{.underline}. Moreover, [many U.S. wars have been
fought to secure more oil]{.underline}. [**[Protecting the U.S. right to
create climate change is]{.mark} thus [fueling "forever"
wars]{.mark}.**¶ [The Pentagon]{.mark} also does not tell us that it [is
the world's biggest institutional]{.mark} [creator of carbon
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[While climate change drives war,
[militarism drives climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is not
just about the obvious environmental destruction wrought by war. The
modern military is a monster carbon producer, with massive carbon burned
every day in training and wartime military flights; in fueling huge
naval carriers, submarines and tanks; in producing planes and munitions;
and in running more than a thousand military bases.¶ Most of us realize
that the fossil fuel industry makes massive amounts of money while
destroying the environment, but you show how [the development of the
fossil fuel industry is inextricable from the advent of modern
capitalism]{.underline}. Tell us about this.¶ While fossil fuels were
central to capitalist development, it didn't have to be that way. Early
industrial capitalism could have developed without fossil fuels. Indeed,
19^th^ century British factories initially used water-powered steam
engines but shifted away toward coal and oil.¶ [Tank warfare and the new
importance of planes in World War I was a major catalyst for [the 20th
century shift toward oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. [World War II sealed the
deal.¶ This [had less to do with technological efficiency than social
and political factors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Owners were worried that
water would be viewed as part of the commons and subject to public
controls or appropriation, threatening profits. [Coal and oil were less
likely to be viewed as part of the commons]{.underline}, since they were
not as historically central to public use and well-being as water.¶
[[The]{.mark} long historical [shift from coal to]{.mark}ward [oil was
also driven by social and political interests]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather than technological advantages. Coal miners were rebellious at an
early stage, mobilized by communities formed working under adverse and
dangerous conditions[. Fear of unions helped shift industrial capitalism
in the late 19th and 20th centuries toward oil.¶ [Oil became the central
energy source of U.S. 20th century capitalism largely because of
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially World War I and World War II. Tank
warfare and the new importance of planes in World War I was a major
catalyst for the 20^th^ century shift toward oil. World War II sealed
the deal. [Enormous amounts of oil were needed to power the planes and
produce the arms to win]{.underline} this huge conflagration. [And U.S.
interests in both securing and selling oil in Asia were a major factor
fueling U.S. interest in war in the Pacific.¶ [The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} has set the Doomsday Clock at 90 seconds
to midnight, the closest it has ever been. Why has the risk of nuclear
catastrophe become so heightened?¶ The Bulletin [issued a
statement](https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/press-release-doomsday-clock-set-at-90-seconds-to-midnight/)
saying the change was "largely but not exclusively" due to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. They also [[now connect nuclear doomsday with
environmental doomsday]{.underline}]{.mark}, noting that climate change
and other environmental-linked threats such as COVID-19 played a role in
resetting the clock. [They are pulling the curtain back to reveal some
of the "triangle of extinction."]{.underline}¶ The Doomsday Clock is an
important symbol, recognized around the world as a crucial indicator of
potential imminent extinction. Founded in Chicago after the U.S.
development of the nuclear bomb --- a subject popularized in the film
*Oppenheimer* --- [[the]{.mark} Bulletin's [scientists]{.mark}, despite
their major contributions, [have]{.mark} their own
[limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}. They are not political economists or
social theorists, and [their [U.S. roots have shaped their
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This may explain why [they have not
portrayed the full "triangle of extinction," nor]{.mark} focused on
**[the unique U.S. role in supercharging]{.mark}** the race to
**[extinction]{.mark}**.¶]{.underline} This goes beyond their relative
lack of attention to the historical role of the U.S. and NATO in leading
up to the Ukraine war. [They have not offered a strong critique of the
extinction risks [inherent in building U.S. hegemony throughout the
nuclear era]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nor have they highlighted [the U.S.
role in catalyzing Middle Eastern wars for oil and]{.mark} now [heating
up the new Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline} [with both Russia and China, as
well as playing a role in [the current Israel-Hamas-Iran-U.S. military
crisis]{.mark}, [all intensifying extinction perils]{.mark}.¶ The
building of a world economy around U.S.-dominated oil and arms is the
heart of today's "extinction triangle]{.underline}." \[But\] instead of
seeing extinction, many in the U.S. see a chosen people's defense of
liberty.¶ Nor does the Bulletin highlight how [capitalist economies, and
especially **[U.S. militarized capitalism]{.mark}**, [are **crucial
structural extinction forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We hope that the
Bulletin's scientists will read *Dying for Capitalism*. If the nuclear
scientists were to discuss the need to transform U.S. militarized
capitalism, it would expose more of the "triangle of extinction," and
help mobilize both scientists and the public.¶ While you are focused
mostly on the disastrous impact of capitalism, you also take on elements
of American culture in Dying for Capitalism. In particular, you discuss
the myth of American exceptionalism. How did this idea come to be so
ingrained in American culture and how does it undermine solutions to the
dire problems we face today?¶ [American exceptionalism --- the idea that
the U.S. is the only nation equipped to manage world affairs and
preserve freedom and democracy --- goes back to the foundation of the
nation]{.underline}. The Puritans defined their settlement in America as
a blessed "city on the hill." George Washington stated that the U.S. was
destined to become a great empire. The Monroe Doctrine confirmed that
empire would begin in the Americas itself.¶ Soon thereafter, [the U.S.
embraced the doctrine of Manifest Destiny]{.underline}, perhaps [the
most seductive military and moral doctrine of American exceptionalism,
legitimating military expansion]{.underline} into the Pacific, including
the murderous colonization of the Philippines. [Teddy
Roosevelt's]{.underline} [idealization of himself as a "rough rider" was
part of the new 20th century U.S. drive to global empire; Roosevelt's
idealization of war, tied to his close relation to robber baron
capitalists]{.underline}, such as the Morgan and Rockefeller financial
and oil interests[, helped fuel the long drive to a U.S.-led global
fossil fuel, militarized capitalism.¶ Empires need]{.underline} what I
have called "[immoral morality," the use of lofty moral ideals to
legitimate evil behavior]{.underline}. [[U.S. exceptionalism cloaked the
rise of U.S. fossil fuel-based]{.mark}, militarist [global
empire]{.mark} [as a crusade for democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
building of a world economy around U.S.-dominated oil and arms is the
heart of today's "extinction triangle," shrouded in immoral
morality]{.underline}. Instead of seeing extinction, many in the U.S.
see a chosen people's defense of liberty.¶ You write that "[[green
capitalism is an oxymoron]{.underline}]{.mark}." Why?¶ [Americans have
long been taught that technology is the solution to
everything]{.underline}. [Green capitalism exploits this]{.underline}
seductive approach, which [[tells Americans]{.mark} not to worry: [our
technological prowess will solve climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Instead of helping Americans see
capitalism as a leading cause of climate change, it flips the equation
and says that capitalism is the solution]{.underline}, since only
capitalism can create the technological innovations --- whether electric
cars, carbon capture, geo-engineering or cheap wind and solar energy ---
that will save the planet.¶ [[Without changes in capitalist appetites
for]{.mark} insatiable [profit]{.mark}, [growth]{.mark},
[consumerism]{.mark}, expansion [and]{.mark} [war]{.mark}, [the system
will continue to place an infinite burden on a finite
planet]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} Technology is obviously important in
dealing with climate change. But [**[even if capitalism
delivers]{.mark}** many **[green tech]{.mark}**nologies, **[it will not
prevent climate disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our book explains why
"green capitalism" is a dangerous illusion. Without changes in
capitalist appetites for insatiable profit, growth, consumerism,
expansion and war, the system will continue to place an infinite burden
on a finite planet.

#### Historical materialism reveals that capitalist accumulation depends not only on workplace exploitation but also on the expropriation of nature and marginalized populations --- resistance to Arctic extraction must be re-theorized as class struggle rooted in the intersecting crises of labor, ecology, and imperialism, challenging the aff's reproduction of these relations.

Andreas Bieler and Madelaine Moore, 2023

Bieler, Andreas, and Madelaine Moore. \"Water grabbing, capitalist
accumulation and resistance: Conceptualising the multiple dimensions of
class struggle.\" *Global Labour Journal* 14.1 (2023).

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396821996273

[[In this article, we have argued that while capitalism depends on, and
is driven by, the exploitation of surplus value in commodity production
based on wage labour and the private ownership of the means of
production, accumulation also depends on expropriation in the spheres of
social reproduction and nature.]{.mark}]{.underline} As feminist Social
Reproduction Theory has [[reminded historical materialists, capitalist
accumulation not only depends on exploitation in the workplace, but
equally on expropriation of unpaid labour in the sphere of social
reproduction.]{.mark}]{.underline} Struggles for affordable water for
all are, therefore, also potential moments of class struggle against
capitalist accumulation. Moreover[, [post-colonial theory has reminded
historical materialists that current forms of exploitation and
expropriation are also the result of how capitalism has historically
emerged through the expropriation of non-white people through slavery
and settler colonialism, often going hand in hand with the genocide of
Indigenous people. Hence, the struggles for access to water by
racialised communities such as the Detroit Water Brigade or resistance
by the Oceti Sakowin at Standing Rock in the United States are also
contesting the expansion of capitalist accumulation and, therefore, can
be conceptualised as potential forms of class struggle. In turn, as
eco-socialists have reminded historical materialists, capitalist
accumulation not only depends on exploitation in the workplace, but also
on the expropriation (and production) of cheap natures. Hence, struggles
over pipelines to transport crude oil or new open-cast mines can also be
conceptualised as potential class struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In short, in understanding that capitalist reproduction depends upon
exploitation as well as expropriation, struggles that contest the
expropriation of nature, or along racial and gender lines, or that
demand the improvement of working-class conditions in the broadest
sense]{.underline} (such as affordable and clean water supply) are
integral rather than epiphenomenal to capitalist social relations. This
allows us to comprehend the diversity of trade unions, social movements,
environmental NGOs, development groups and Indigenous people who come
together and mobilise against water expropriation as moments of
potential class struggle. Theorising water struggles as potential class
struggles allows us to reveal the internal relations between
exploitation of wage labour in commodity production and patriarchal,
racial and other forms of oppression. By working through the different
dynamics of expropriation, of which water grabbing is a concrete form,
we locate these struggles as sites where expropriation and exploitation
are possible and often intertwined. Struggles against water grabbing can
tackle exploitation (such as changed working conditions in privatised
water companies), expropriation (such as the introduction of water
charges or declining quality of water supply) and the interrelated
genocide of Indigenous people. Each "motivation" is not separate and
only intersecting at a certain point. [[They are instead internally
related and represent different moments in the processes that mark
capitalist reproduction, and can challenge different contradictions and
crises inherent to capitalism mediated by their own historical-political
specificities. In other words, water struggles are mediated forms of
potential class struggle, where class struggle is understood as
capturing both expropriation and exploitation, while always mediated by
the historical-political specificities of each context.]{.underline} [By
understanding class struggle as an analytical category inclusive of both
expropriation and exploitation, the terrain of struggle is expanded from
surplus value creation in commodity production based on wage labour to
include the conditions upon which capitalist reproduction depends --
social reproduction and nature. What comes into focus is an open,
contradictory and articulated capitalist political
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Arruzza, 2014: 3--6), [[which allows us to
recognise that contradictions and subsequent struggles can emerge across
each internally related sphere.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### U.S. Arctic policy masks imperial ambition behind rhetoric of cooperation --- its true focus is securing economic and strategic dominance through capitalist expansion and neocolonial control of resource frontiers, revealing the aff's exploration as an extension of U.S. hegemonic interest.

In October of 2022, the U.S. published a new Arctic Policy that
incorporates some of its past Arctic priorities while also including a
new focus on the Arctic inhabitants and its Indigenous peoples'
livelihoods and increased Arctic cooperation[. Since the increased
prioritization of the Arctic region in the U.S.'s foreign policy agenda,
many politicians, researchers, and scholars have critiqued the U.S.'s
Arctic interests and its sincerity towards the Arctic region. Previous
research on the U.S. Arctic interests and priorities indicated that the
U.S. has historically been interested in the region's economic and
military opportunities, both of which protect and promote solely the
best interests U.S. while hindering other smaller Arctic states and
entities. The U.S.'s economic pull towards the region heavily denotes
capitalistic motives towards the Arctic region, as the region\'s
extensive natural resources are to be increasingly unveiled from under
the Arctic's thick permafrost. The U.S.'s intense interest in Alaska's
and Greenland's 'natural resource frontier' continues to reveal
capitalistic behaviors supportive of the U.S.'s economic prosperity.
Meanwhile, neocolonialism ideals of back-dooring into economies are also
suggested, as the U.S. has historical and current motives to 'purchase'
the Arctic. Considering the U.S.'s purchase of Alaska in 1867, its
interest in 'buying' Iceland in 1868, and a recent attempt in 2019 by
President Donald Trump to 'buy' Greenland, raises the suggestion that
the U.S. is still acting imperialistically via the modern form of
neocolonialism. Without consideration of non-state actors well-being,
inclusion, and livelihoods, while operating in a capitalistic and
neocolonialist manner, leaves the Arctic inhabitants and its Indigenous
peoples with considerable human security issues. The discussion chapter
explores in depth how the lack of focus on Indigenous peoples in the
Arctic discourse shapes the way human security issues are view in the
region.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative\'s engagement with the Arctic participates in the capitalist production of social space through \"real abstractions\"---treating the region as an abstract, fragmented frontier for resource extraction, securitization, or scientific intervention. This mirrors the logics of global capitalism that deterritorialize space, commodify nature, and perpetuate racialized empire under the guise of exploration or environmental governance.

[One domain in which real or concrete abstractions have been deployed to
great effect is the production of social space under capitalism---a
space for example like the Arctic]{.underline}. Henri Lefebvre (2005) in
his theorization of the multi-scalar and hyper complexity of space under
capitalism, drew upon Marx directly and the idea that abstraction
becomes real in practice (Stanek 2008; Butler 2016). Lefebvre (2009: 88)
noted that "[there can be no pure abstraction"---no pure abstract
space---but rather the "concrete abstract]{.underline}." He offers an
account of the rise of forms of abstraction in thought, practice, and
experience in association with the different transformations of modes of
production of social space under global capitalism. [Abstract forms can
be understood in part through the ways in which special processes---
fragmentation, scale, nesting, networks---are part of the real
abstraction of existing forms of capitalism.]{.underline} These sorts of
ideas have been usefully employed in the extractive arena, for example,
the concept of "hyper-extraction" or "the planetary mine" what has been
termed expanded, extended, or enhanced extraction (McNeish and Shapiro
2021). These ideas draw upon three strands of political economy. One is
the move to deterritorialize and render planetary the mine, and the idea
that "capitalist urbanization secrets the planetary mine---everyday,
above ground, scattered, diff use, perpetual and swelling" (Labban 2014;
also Arias-Loyola 2020). [Central to the planetary approach is not
simply scale, and interconnectivity]{.underline} (the city as the
"inverted mine") [and breaking with methodological
nationalism]{.underline} (the extractive nation or state); [rather it is
to see extraction as a set of shifting dynamic frontiers produced and
enmeshed in forms of contemporary racialized capitalism and
empire.]{.underline} A second is the related work of Sandra Mezzadra and
Brett Neilson (2020) in their book The Politics of Operations. 2 [Their
focus is on the production of multiple edges and frontiers of expanding
capitalism, the layered sovereignties and variegated legal spaces of
global capital,3 and the new spatial and temporal complexities of
capitalism associated with capital's circulation and colonization of
social life, what they call the politics of operations. In particular it
is the operations of a trifecta of sectors and their connections that
provide the core entry point: extraction, logistics, and finance.4 Here
we are necessarily tacking back and forth between the concrete and the
abstract, between materials, flows, sensing, asset classes, money, the
image world, and multiple forms of expertise.]{.underline}

#### The aff's engagement with the Arctic relies on capitalist abstractions---treating space, labor, and social life as objects that can be managed or studied. This mirrors how capitalism makes abstract ideas like territory seem real and powerful, dominating people's lives through impersonal systems. By using scientific, economic, or strategic frameworks to understand the Arctic, the aff reinforces the alienation and control that Marx identified as central to capitalist society.

[Marxism points to three articulations of abstraction relevant to the
contributions on Arctic late industrialism]{.underline} (see Butler
2016). [First, in capitalist society the abstract functions
concretely.]{.underline} As Paci (1969: 11, 18) puts it: "this concrete
function, notwithstanding the fact that it is really abstract, is bound
to precise consequences: the social relation appears as if it were a
thing and in fact functions as a thing, while it is not a thing. . . .
[The fundamental character of capitalism . . . reveals itself in the
tendency to make abstract categories live as if they were
concrete"]{.underline} (emphasis added). [Second]{.underline}, Marx
(1975) presents abstraction as driving both processes of intellectual
fragmentation and the alienation of people from their labor and their
lived, bodily experiences. The link between abstraction and alienation
is central to the work of Moishe Postone's reconstruction of Marx's
social theory focusing on the central role played by the domination of
people by "abstract, quasi-independent structures of social relations"
(1993: 125). [Capitalist social relations secure domination via
abstraction and impersonality]{.underline}. In Marx's (1973: 164) words,
"Individuals . . . are now ruled by abstractions, whereas earlier they
depended on one another. The abstraction, or idea, however, is nothing
more than the theoretical expression of those material relations which
are their lord and master. And [third, in capitalism it is labor that is
both concrete and abstract, and that tension is replicated and
externalized in other forms"]{.underline} (including as Mason notes in
other forms of value, such as money) and in forms of social organization
and knowledge. [Regardless of the primacy of one real abstraction
(money) over another (labor power)]{.underline}, says Robert Gehl
(2012), "the effects of any real abstraction include material
consequences . . . real abstractions express themselves in social
organization and are expressions of social organization." The reality is
human agency, the abstraction is the immaterial constitution of a whole
way of life. A central purpose of Arctic Abstractive Industries is to
explore these relations between abstraction and forms of life and
abstraction is a red thread running across this book.

Yet, the Anthropocene, like its sibling Capitalocene, has also
been [**criticized **](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-term-anthropocene-is-popular-and-problematic/)due
to its human-centric ontology, technocratic belief in future solutions,
and ignorance of the role of economics in causing environmental crises.
As [the recently emerged lively academic debate about [planetary
politics](https://www.planetpolitics.org/vision) and the [rights of
nature](https://www.ipbes.net/policy-support/tools-instruments/rights-nature-ron) demonstrates,
new kinds of ecological imaginaries about the relationship between
humanity and the rest of nature are urgently needed to induce
fundamental changes in our political and economic systems. However, this
task looks overwhelming in the current world dominated by capitalism
and Realpolitik -- dynamics that have also turned the Arctic into
the [focus](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/rising-tensions-shifting-strategies-evolving-dynamics-us-grand-strategy-arctic/) of
international policy debates and strategies.]{.underline}

[It is hardly surprising that the bulk of Arctic political and legal
studies view the Arctic in terms of sovereignty and territoriality.
Similarly, political and legal maps and discussions of the Arctic Ocean
divide the ocean into internal and territorial waters, coastal states'
exclusive economic zones, and high seas, and the seafloor into partly
overlapping claims for extended continental shelves made by the littoral
states, and seabed beyond any state's continental shelf. In such
discourses, no attention is paid to the unique features of the Arctic
marine ecosystems, more-than-human communities, pluriversal ontologies,
or imaginaries and (traditional) ways of life of the many communities,
both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, living on the Arctic Ocean
coast.]{.underline}

#### Capitalist interests are rapidly transforming the Arctic from a remote, ecologically rich region into a hub for economic exploitation. The influx of investment, driven by the pursuit of profit, prioritizes infrastructure and development over the preservation of the environment and the rights of Indigenous communities.

WHILE IRONIC that the first freight to traverse the Northwest Passage
for cost-saving reasons was environmentally unfriendly coal, the voyage
indicates warming Arctic waters are opening the region for development.

The Northwest Passage --- when experiencing lighter-than-usual ice
conditions --- is shorter and cheaper. The risks have become manageable
and insurable. Plus, the Nordic Orion's owners knew the ship could take
a 25% larger load, while saving USD \$80,000 in fuel costs. Many of the
factors driving change in the Arctic economy, as well as the many
associated opportunities and risks, are described in an upcoming report
from WWF looking at the Arctic's economy in marine, maritime, and
coastal development terms --- the "Blue Economy."

[Investors believe that over USD \$1 trillion will be heading to the
Arctic in coming years, principally to develop infrastructure: roads,
ports, airports, hotels, housing, hospitals, schools and other
facilities. Guggenheim Partners, a global investment and advisory
financial services firm, has estimated that over USD \$500 billion in
infrastructure is already being planned.]{.underline}

[This combination of warming physical conditions and increasing
investment is not only changing the Arctic, it is changing how humanity
sees the Arctic. No longer a remote and inaccessible place dominated by
nature and impenetrable ice, visited only by researchers and
adventurers, the Arctic is fast becoming a tourist destination, an
aquaculture development zone, a real estate opportunity, an Internet
cable route, a shipping shortcut and more.]{.underline} The speed of
change is likely to catch many people by surprise. Some Arctic
researchers I've spoken to are inclined to dismiss these trends, saying
for example that expectations for the opening of the Arctic to shipping
or mining are greatly exaggerated. But those who doubt that an
unstoppable wave of economic investment is heading to the Arctic should
take a closer look at the investment intentions of large players such as
China. Transformative change often starts slowly but builds with
surprising speed.

[Most of the Arctic economy, including tourism, is linked to its ocean
and coasts. Iceland received well over two million visitors last year,
an increase of about 400 per cent in one decade. Svalbard tourism
increased by 100 per cent over the same period]{.underline}. Last year a
tour company operating out of Murmansk was offering five different
departures for the opportunity to ride an icebreaker to the North Pole,
while Norway's national tourism agency has produced a YouTube campaign
on how to hike in Arctic coastal regions to better prepare tourists for
vacationing in extreme Arctic conditions.

[The Arctic is an increasingly attractive item on the "bucket list" of
many tourists. While this helps improve knowledge and hopefully, concern
about the Arctic environment, tourism increases environmental
risk.]{.underline}

[Other Arctic Blue Economy sectors are experiencing similar growth and
challenges. Norway's salmon aquaculture industry grew by 500 per cent
from 1997-2016, and by 31 per cent from 2015-16. About 40 per cent of
that growth happens in Arctic coastal waters; and Norway has also begun
investing in Icelandic aquaculture.]{.underline}

[The Arctic currently produces 10 per cent of the world's oil and 25 per
cent of its natural gas, mostly from onshore sources. It is believed to
hold 22 per cent of the world's undiscovered reserves under the Arctic
Ocean. These sectors tend to dominate reporting on Arctic economic
development issues.]{.underline}

Accessed 02-15-2022)

To answer these questions, we must come to grips with a [key feature of
the world economy]{.underline}---one that pundits in the global North
tend either to ignore or wish away---namely, the fact that
**[[capitalist growth is fundamentally dependent on
imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This arrangement, which has
persisted now for 500 years]{.underline} in various forms, [is beginning
to come under significant strain, and climate breakdown is likely to
widen the cracks]{.underline}. This opens up opportunities for change,
but also poses significant dangers. Everything depends on how
governments and social movements choose to respond.

The key thing to grasp is that, [under [capitalism]{.mark}, "growth" is
not about increasing production in order to meet human
needs]{.underline}. [It [is about increasing production in order
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[extract and accumulate
profit]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [That is the overriding
objective]{.underline}. [To keep such a system going
requires]{.underline} several interventions. First, you have to
[**cheapen** the prices of inputs]{.underline} (labor, land, materials,
energy, suppliers, etc.) as much as possible, and maintain those prices
at a low level. Second, you have to ensure [a constantly increasing
supply of those cheap inputs]{.underline}. And third, you need to
[establish control over captive markets that will absorb your
output]{.underline}.

[[Growth]{.mark} along these lines [cannot occur within an **isolated**
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you place too much pressure on your
domestic resource base or your domestic working class, sooner or later
you are likely to face a revolution. [To avoid such an
outcome,]{.underline} **[[capitalism always requires an
"outside,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** external to itself, [where it can
cheapen labor and nature with impunity and appropriate them on a vast
scale]{.underline}; an outside [[where it can]{.underline}
**["externalize"]{.underline}** [social and ecological
damages]{.underline}]{.mark}, where rebellions can be contained, and
where it does not have to negotiate with local grievances or demands.

[This is where the colonies come in]{.underline}. From the origins of
capitalism in the late 15th century, [[growth in the "core"]{.mark} of
the world economy]{.underline} (Western Europe, the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan) [[has always depended on
the]{.underline} **[sabotage of labor and resources in the
"periphery"]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Consider the silver plundered from
the Andes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the sugar and cotton extracted from
land [appropriated from Indigenous Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
grain, rubber, gold [and countless other resources appropriated from
Asia and Africa]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the [mass
enslavement]{.mark} and indenture of African and Indigenous
people]{.underline}---all of which exacted a staggering human and
ecological toll. On top of this, [colonizers destroyed local industries
and self-sufficient economies wherever they went, in order to establish
captive markets]{.underline}. There was no lag between the rise of
capitalism and the imperial project. **[Imperialism was the *mechanism*
of capitalist expansion]{.underline}**.

As the Indian economists Utsa Patnaik and Prabhat Patnaik put it,
[[capitalist growth requires an imperial
arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark}---not as a side gig but [[as
a]{.underline} ***[structurally necessary feature]{.underline}***.
[Imperialism ensures that inputs remain cheap]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and
thus maintains the conditions for capital accumulation]{.underline}. But
it [also underpins the fragile inter-class truce that prevails in the
core states]{.underline}. If you're going to raise the real wages of the
working classes in the core, or take steps to protect the local ecology,
then in order to maintain capital accumulation you have to compensate
for this by depressing the costs of labor and nature elsewhere, namely,
among workers and producers in the global South. Ever since the rise of
the labor movement in the late 19th century, [capital's concessions to
the working classes in Europe and the United States have been
possible]{.underline} in large part [because of
imperialism]{.underline}.

[This arrangement came under strain in the middle of the 20th
century]{.underline}, however, as radical anti-imperialist movements
gained traction across the global South. After winning political
independence, many Southern governments set about dismantling colonial
systems of extraction. They protected their economies and supported
their domestic producers using tariffs, subsidies and capital controls;
they instituted land reforms; they nationalized key resources and
industries; they rolled out public services and improved workers' wages.
This movement was successful in advancing economic sovereignty and
improving human development across much of the South. But it also
constrained the core's access to cheap labor and nature, and reduced
their control over Southern markets.

[The collapse of the imperial arrangement posed a significant threat to
Northern capital accumulation]{.underline}. This problem was mitigated
for a time by Keynesian policy: massive government expenditure boosted
aggregate demand in the global North and generated an extraordinary
economic expansion, providing a temporary "fix" for capital. Further
concessions to the working classes of the core were sustained under
these conditions, permitting the rise of social democracy in some
states. But [this fix could only hold for so long]{.underline}. As wages
rose in the core and the supply price rose in the periphery, growth
ground to a halt, capital accumulation became increasingly untenable,
and [by the mid-1970s the economies of the global North were overcome by
a full-blown crisis of stagflation]{.underline}. As it turns out,
**[[capitalism cannot function]{.underline}]{.mark}** for long [**[under
conditions of global justice]{.underline}**. [Fair wages and
decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark} are compatible with a functioning
economy, but they [[are not compatible with a functioning capitalist
economy, because they limit the possibility of capital
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[To deal with]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark} of the 1970s, capital needed
a way to restore the imperial arrangement]{.underline}, to once again
depress Southern prices and regain access to Southern markets. [To
achieve this, the [core states]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[intervened]{.underline}** [to depose progressive leaders in the
global South]{.underline}]{.mark}---including, most prominently,
Mossadegh in Iran, Arbenz in Guatemala, Sukarno in Indonesia, Nkrumah in
Ghana, and Allende in Chile---[replacing them with regimes more amenable
to Northern economic interests]{.underline}. But [[the final blow was
delivered by]{.mark}]{.underline} the World Bank and the IMF, which
during the 1980s and 1990s imposed neoliberal structural adjustment
programs (**[[SAPs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) across the region. [This move
shifted control over economic policy from the national parliaments of
the South to technocrats in Washington and bankers in New
York]{.underline} and London, ending the brief era of economic
sovereignty. SAPs dismantled protections on labor and the environment,
privatized public goods and cut public spending, reversing the reforms
of the anti-colonial movement in one fell swoop.

[It worked: wages and prices in the South collapsed under structural
adjustment, and [the new]{.mark} "free trade" [regime allowed Northern
capital to shift production abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to take
direct advantage of cheap labor and inputs. [This enabled a massive
increase in the scale and intensity of appropriation from the global
South during the 1980s and 1990s, restoring the imperial arrangement and
resolving the crisis of capitalism]{.underline}. Those who see
neoliberalism as the main problem, and who fantasize about reverting to
a less destructive version of capitalist growth, fail to grasp this
point. The neoliberal turn was not some kind of mistake; it was
necessary to restore the conditions for growth in the core. It was the
obligatory next step in capitalist development.

[[But now]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the 21st century wears on, [the
engines of imperial appropriation are slowing down again]{.underline}.
[This reality is evident in the declining rate of economic growth in the
core states]{.underline}, which economists have come to refer to as
"secular stagnation." This is happening for several reasons.

[First]{.underline}, in the wake of structural adjustment, the collapse
of the USSR, and the semi-integration of China, [there are few
nation-states and territories left that have not been brought into the
remit of the capitalist world system]{.underline}. **[[Imperialist
expansion has]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectively
**[[reached]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[limits]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the planet. Now, instead of shifting production to new pools of cheap
labor, capital has to deal with the existing workforce and their demands
for higher wages. Second, certain regions of the South---specifically
China and the leftist states of South America---are managing to push
back against imperialism and improve their terms of trade, even while
operating within the basic structure of the capitalist economy. All of
[this is leading to a rising supply price, which spells trouble for
capital accumulation --- and growth --- in the core]{.underline}.

But perhaps most importantly --- and this is the clincher --- [climate
change and ecological breakdown are beginning to]{.underline}
**[undermine the conditions of production]{.underline}** [on the
tropical landmass]{.underline}. This is beginning to manifest already,
[with climate chaos ravaging parts of Central America, the Middle East
and North Africa]{.underline}, driving social dislocation and human
displacement. Without some kind of dramatic change in direction it will
get much worse. With [existing policies]{.underline}, we are headed for
2.7 degrees of heating this century, which is [likely to trigger
multi-breadbasket failure and sustained food supply disruptions across
large parts of the global South]{.underline}, displace more than 1.5
billion people, wipe out 30--50% of species, and render much of the
tropics uninhabitable for humans.

[This is a problem for capital, because **[growth]{.mark} in the global
North [depends]{.mark}**]{.underline} utterly **[[on]{.mark} production
in the global South]{.underline}** and depends utterly on **[[Southern
land and resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[today just as much as
during the colonial period]{.underline}. Recent research finds that
[rich countries rely on]{.underline} a net appropriation of land equal
to twice the size of India, a net appropriation of **[[10 billion
tons]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of material resources per year,
[and]{.mark} a net appropriation of embodied labor equivalent
to]{.underline} a standing army of **[[180 million
workers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This means that [as labor is displaced
and disrupted, and as the productive capacity of land is
constrained]{.underline} by heatwaves, wildfires, storms and
desertification, [[this will lead to a rising supply price in the core
that will trigger a **severe crisis for
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[more serious than anything it has yet
encountered]{.underline}.

[The question is, [how will the core states
respond?]{.mark}]{.underline} To maintain the rate of growth and capital
accumulation in the face of this crisis, they will have to find a way to
cut the supply price once again.

[There are two obvious possibilities]{.underline}. [[One option
is]{.mark} to cut wages]{.underline} in the core states, [shred the
welfare system and privatize public services]{.underline}, all of which
would help cheapen inputs and open up new frontiers for accumulation,
giving some reprieve to capital. This option --- **[[domestic neoliberal
austerity]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- was deployed in the US and Britain
during the 1980s as part of the response to the initial collapse of the
imperial arrangement. Now it [is being increasingly taken up by the
European social democracies]{.underline} themselves, including the
Nordics.

Of course, the risk of [this approach]{.underline} is that it [could
trigger a backlash from the domestic working class]{.underline}, which
could coalesce into a socialist revolution. [Aware of this danger,
[politicians will seek to promote]{.mark} anti-immigrant
and]{.underline} [**[white nationalist]{.underline}**
[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. By directing working-class grievance
toward an "other," [this approach gets people to accept their own
immiseration, so long as they can feel an affinity with the ruling class
on the basis of race]{.underline}, and feel superior to people of colour
who are kept in conditions more miserable than their own. This strategy
has long been used to support the neoliberal project in the United
States, and the ruling classes of the UK and Europe are now also turning
to this playbook. Boris Johnson is a master of this in British politics.

[[The second option is that the core states could **double down on
imperialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is not difficult to
imagine]{.underline} [**[new rounds of invasion]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[occupation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [intended to
force Southern prices back down]{.underline}. [[The recent coup
in]{.underline} **[Bolivia]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [backed by the U.S.
with its rising appetite for cheap lithium, offers hints of what might
come]{.underline}. And it is clear that the [Biden]{.underline}
administration, just as under Trump before him , [is]{.underline}
already [preparing the grounds for aggression against
China]{.underline}, among other things [to constrain China's domestic
demand for resources]{.underline}. Imperialist interventions that
cheapen the supply price would allow capitalists in the global North to
maintain accumulation and sustain their truce with the working classes
of the core for a little while longer, even as the world crumbles around
them.

[If left to itself, this is how the capitalist story will play out in
the 21st century]{.underline}[: **[neoliberal austerity]{.underline}**,
**[white supremacist ideology]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[violent imperialist interventions]{.underline}**---]{.mark}**[all
[for the sake of maintaining growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** and capital
accumulation **[in the core]{.underline}**. [Indeed, this]{.underline}
barbarism [is already well underway]{.underline}. [Liberal
politicians]{.underline} denounce the barbarism at every opportunity,
and yet they [cannot bring themselves to address its underlying causes
because they remain fundamentally committed to capitalist
growth]{.underline}. The solution that the liberals offer---capital
accumulation without barbarism--- is a chimera.

#### The aff's approach to developing the Arctic fuels the same capitalist system that has caused mass environmental destruction, colonial dispossession, and cultural erasure. Capitalism treats nature and Indigenous life as cheap resources for profit, which leads to climate chaos, species extinction, and the breakdown of Indigenous food systems and cultures. Efforts to \"green\" Arctic development through clean energy or economic growth are part of the same colonial logic that treats land and people as tools for accumulation. This system is historically rooted in European imperialism and transatlantic slavery---and continuing it ensures ongoing planetary collapse and racialized violence.

Patterns of Environment-making: the Arctic and its Global Contexts, The
Arctic University of Norway

https://uit.no/tavla/artikkel/850824/patterns_of_environment-making_the_arctic_and_it

[The present situation of the world as we know it is undergoing
processes of radical change that have had and continue to have
disastrous consequences for ecosystems and planetary life. Entwined in a
history of capitalism, colonialism and industrialisation, humanity is
facing the effects of climate change with rising sea levels, draught,
flood and wildfires, alongside deforestation, the loss and toxification
of nature and the mass extinction of animal populations. In the Arctic,
environmental change is happening fast. For]{.underline} Arctic
Indigenous communities, the warming of air and sea temperatures and
resulting reduction of land and sea ice, fish and other marine species
are disappearing, as are the habitat of mammals such as polar bears,
seals and walruses. This in turn affects the food supply and social and
cultural fabric of the Indigenous communities that rely on these animals
for sustenance.\[1\] Similarly, on the Arctic tundra climate instability
in winter cause food insecurity for the reindeer, which, alongside
increased pressure from predators, reduces the herds. This again has
become a threat to the Indigenous reindeer herders' livelihood and
cultural existence.\[2\]

[Alongside the rapid climate change we are witnessing in the Arctic,
various nations (Canada, USA, China, Russia, and the Nordic countries)
stake a claim to the region to secure 'their' share in its natural
resources]{.underline} (including Arctic fauna, oil and metals) --
[frequently to develop so-called green solutions and clean
energy]{.underline} (such as windmill parks and copper mines). [This
move to appropriate inhabited and living lands to harness the work of
nature in projects of development building economic wealth and
geopolitical power continues the centuries-long modus operandi of
capitalism, colonialism and globalisation that has conditioned
large-scale human-initiated environmental change and fuels the current
climate crisis.\[]{.underline}3\]

[The foundation of human-initiated environmental change was laid with
the rise of European capitalism in the fifteenth century, which
commenced a capitalist world ecology]{.underline} and what Jason W.
Moore terms the Age of Capital, or Capitalocene.\[4\] Although 'Europe'
and the 'West' did not exist as a geohistorical force or geocultural
formation until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from 1450 the
European 'seats of imperial power and centers of financial might' began
large-scale, [capitalist systems of environment-making that both enabled
and 'accelerated environmental transformations beyond anything known
before']{.underline}.\[5\]   

[Understood as a system of controlling environments that bundles
economic and social relations with and within nature, capitalism made
possible a radical remaking of nature and human relations to nature and
work.\[6\] Alongside capitalism's new forms of production that exploited
and materially changed large tracts of nature and its webs of life, a
new ideology developed that justified these intrusions. Through filters
of power-inequality relating to class, race, nation, gender and
sexuality, capitalism invented and operated on a separation between
humanity and nature]{.underline}. This Humanity/Nature divide was
created and enacted by the ruling class, who saw themselves as members
of Humanity and unquestionably separate from Nature. At the same time,
they designated other people and other life forms as Nature.\[7\]
[Capitalism's Human/Nature divide allowed nature, animals and humans to
become 'cheap Nature': an entity external to and abstracted from
Humanity and valued only in terms of its potential to produce and
accumulate capital]{.underline} (through unpaid labour and extraction of
human, animal and natural resources) [as cheaply as
possible]{.underline}.\[8\] [Through capitalism, Nature came to
represent 'all those forms of life and labor that provided useful work,
but were culturally and juridically excluded from the cash nexus' -- and
could consequently be put to work cost-free]{.underline}.\[9\] [Because
capitalist systems of production exhausted the life-making capacities of
these appropriated relationships and forms of labor, they harbored an
inherent need for continuous expansion only colonial ventures could
satisfy.]{.underline}

[As evident in the history of European colonialism, capitalism's
inscription of Nature, allowed the utilisation of Indigenous and African
peoples, women, animals and natural entities as unvalued reproductive
labour. Central to this development was the advent of European
Transatlantic slavery and colonisation around 1450, which commenced a
landscape transformation (including deforestation and large-scale
monocrop plantation systems) unprecedented in speed, scale and
scope]{.underline}.\[10\] [European Transatlantic slavery and
colonisation further allowed a total devaluation and commodification of
human and other forms of life, including the social relationships that
maintained the system and constituted the very conditions of
life]{.underline}.\[11\]

#### Arctic development extends capitalist extractivism, turning Indigenous lands into sacrifice zones for profit. They fuel climate collapse, violate sovereignty, and export wealth to global elites. By 2050, emissions from Arctic extraction could overshoot Paris targets by 700%, locking in ecological disaster.

Extractivism is damaging Arctic ecosystems and warming the global
climate, The Ciricle April 2023

https://www.arcticwwf.org/the-circle/stories/extractivism-is-damaging-arctic-ecosystems-and-warming-the-global-climate/

[The Arctic region is facing down a mineral and fossil fuel exploration
and extraction bonanza. If these plans go ahead, they will have
devastating impacts on Indigenous and local communities, pristine Arctic
ecosystems, and the global climate.]{.underline}

[As a concept, "extractivism" has gained attention recently as mining
and mineral exploration companies eye frontiers that were once
inaccessible]{.underline}: the ocean seabed, the marine offshore, [areas
of the high north]{.underline} and more. Naomi Klein, the prominent
Canadian environmental author who wrote This Changes Everything---a book
about the climate crisis---describes extractivism as "a dominance-based
relationship with the earth" and connects it to what she calls sacrifice
zones: "places that, to their extractors, somehow don't count and can
therefore be poisoned, drained or otherwise destroyed."

[The fossil fuel projects across the Arctic region---in Russia, Norway
and Alaska]{.underline} (the US)---[are exactly that: sacrifice
zones]{.underline}. [Once extracted, hydrocarbons are exported over long
distances for use in other parts of the world, where they contribute to
the increase of global carbon emissions and exacerbate the climate
crisis]{.underline}. As discussed in a [research
brief](https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/reports/research-brief-missing-the-target-fossil-fuel-production-in-the-arctic-is-out-of-step-with-the-1-5c-aligned-emission-reduction-goal/) recently
published by the WWF Global Arctic Programme, this increasing interest
in Arctic fossil fuel production is completely out of touch with the
Paris Agreement to hold global warming to 1.5°C or less. By 2030, the
volume of fossil fuels produced in the Arctic will be double the amount
that is consistent with that goal. By 2050, the gap may reach 700
percent.

[The lack of reciprocity in the economy of oil and gas production is
obvious: the mass-scale removal of resources for export creates an
accumulation of financial benefits far away from the sites of their
extraction, enriching distant shareholders, investment funds and oil
CEOs. But locally, these projects pollute rivers, marine coastal
environments, landscapes and the air. An oil spill in the Arctic would
also devastate ecosystems and Indigenous ways of life. The impacts could
be irreversible, wiping out wildlife populations and destroying
traditional food systems and livelihoods.]{.underline}

#### The aff replicates capitalism's core mechanism: turning land and life into commodities for endless accumulation. The Arctic becomes a "commodity frontier," where resource extraction both widens and deepens capitalist exploitation, sacrificing Indigenous lands and ecosystems for global capital. This process continues a colonial legacy that treats the region as expendable. Capitalist development projects erase traditional lifeways, displace communities, and lock in irreversible socio-environmental harm---all to enrich distant elites.

I[n essence, frontiers can be merely resource frontiers (prior to any
large scale trade), commodity frontiers for trade purposes]{.underline}
([Moore,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0335)[),
or a combination of both]{.underline} ([Kröger and Nygren,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0265)).
[Commodity frontiers are based on two interrelated processes. Namely,
commodity widening, such as through the expansion and occupation of
lands destined to extraction]{.underline} (e.g. in the Arctic region),
[and commodity deepening, which involves intensification of existing
commodity production through socio-technical innovation]{.underline}
(e.g. nickel mining, oil drilling, new infrastructure) ([Banoub et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0030)).
Commodity frontiers have inherently extractive and exploitative
characteristics ([Moore,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0335)),
which often involve environmental injustice, inequalities, and
degradations at the expense of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples ([Beckert et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0040); [Martinez-Alier,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0310)).
Another important characteristic that frontiers have frequently in
common is the resistance of people to injustice, inequality, and
degradation ([Conde,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0085); [Temper
et al.,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0505); [Schneider,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb9113)).
However, mobilization and resistance are not present across all the
cases of frontier expansions, but these depend on the fostering of
contentious agency by particular would-be resistance actors, typically
local communities, there being a wide variety of local responses to
extractivist expansions ([Kröger,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0250)).

[In the specific case of the Arctic region, frontier occupation and
extractivism on commons and Indigenous lands are not new]{.underline}
([Muller-Wille,
1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0355); [Stuhl,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0490)).
[The Arctic resource frontier came into existence in the sixteen century
through the
colonial [geography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/geography) of
the West, mainly via the Nordic countries, other major countries in the
West, and Russia, all of which were subsequently motivated by
large-scale and intensive industrial extraction for trade and
profit]{.underline} ([Avango et al.,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0025)).
For instance, the Dutch and the British established whaling stations and
coal extraction processes
on [Svalbard](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/svalbard) in
1610; the Ivigtut cryolite deposit extraction began in Greenland in
1854; the 1898 Klondike gold rush occurred between Skagway, Alaska and
Yukon in Canada ([Boyd et al.,
2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0060)),
among others.

[What is new to the current wave of frontier expansion, however, is the
increased rapidity and volume of extraction occurring in the
region]{.underline} ([Kröger,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0245)[). [Climate
change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/climate-change) is
facilitating access to some resources in the Arctic]{.underline}
([Landrum and Holland,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0285); [Saebi
et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0440)),
while changing political and economic agendas are attempting to
legitimize new pathways towards extraction, thereby creating destructive
attitudes to the environment and to Arctic peoples ([Bennett,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0055); [Huntington,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0195)).
Such agendas are generally applied without the full consultation and
participation of the affected people, especially Indigenous groups
([Cameron,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0075)).
Thus, the present wave of Arctic extractivism continues to maintain
patterns of the colonial 'past' ([Escobar,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0140); [Körber
et al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0230); [Stuhl,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0490)).
However, for many Arctic people, the land is not a commodity which can
just be acquired at will, but an important element for interrelated and
interdependent environmental and socio-cultural well-being ([Nuttall,
1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0390); [The
Arctic Council,
2015a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0520)).

[The effect of this [resource
depletion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/resource-depletion) is
a threat to the continuation of Indigenous traditions, identities, and
human-nature relationships when large-scale extraction occupies their
lands]{.underline} ([Naykanchina,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0375); [Coombes

2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0295)).
This extraction and exploitation has pushed local communities in the
Arctic and their traditional system of beliefs to the margin ([Bennett,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0055)).
Yet, the benefits of extractive economies are meant for a few local
actors or distant foreigner investors ([Moore,
2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0340)),
while the cost of extractive economies are imposed upon Indigenous
people, pastoralists and fishermen ([Cameron,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0075); [Dwyer
and Istomin,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0130)).

[To maintain political and economic control of the Arctic]{.underline}
([Muller-Wille,
1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0355)[),
two contradictory trends can be seen in the global resource politics of
the region]{.underline} ([Naykanchina,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0375),
p.20). Namely, a vast increase in extractive activities and
infrastructure projects on traditional Indigenous lands undermine the
recognition of Indigenous territorial rights and traditional land-use,
such as reindeer herding, hunting and fishing ([Herrmann et al.,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0190); [Herrmann

2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0375)).
[Therefore, common lands and traditional ways of life in the Arctic are
being rapidly replaced by metal mining, [fossil
fuel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/fossil-fuel) extraction,
wind-power parks, transport infrastructure and hydropower
projects]{.underline} ([Naykanchina,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921003062#bb0375)[).
Consequently, the high levels of industrialized extraction and
utilization of resources are causing often irreversible
socio-environmental damage. This is giving rise to intense
socio-environmental conflict in the region]{.underline} ([Ahtuangaruak,

# Exploration Links 

#### The aff masks exploration as neutral, but it is a capitalist tool used to commodify the Arctic frontier. As polar ice melts, states and corporations launch a new gold rush---not for survival, but for profit and power. The aff justifies and legitimizes this scramble, reinscribing the logic of conquest and accumulation that has always governed capitalist expansion.

Harvard International Review

**Geopolitical Competition in The Arctic Circle**

02.Dec.2020

https://hir.harvard.edu/the-arctic-circle/

[In recent years, the Arctic Circle has become an important symbol of
the devastating impacts of climate change, but its role as a central
focus site for geopolitical conflict deserves an equal amount of
attention and concern. The Arctic Circle, fraught with melting polar ice
caps, is becoming a key stage for global competition and potentially for
the escalation of a great power conflict in the near
future.]{.underline}

[As the Arctic\'s treacherous polar ice caps melt away, nations have
begun to engage in a [modern gold
rush](https://www.economist.com/europe/2007/08/03/gold-rush-under-the-ice?ref=hir.harvard.edu) over
the region's unclaimed territory, natural resources, and strategic
position. As a consequence of the rapidly disappearing polar ice caps,
there has been an increase in unclaimed ocean and land territory, beyond
any nation's control, that countries are attempting to gain jurisdiction
over for purposes, such as resource extraction and [trade
routes](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-races-for-the-arctic-trade-resources-supremacy-tourism-salvation/?ref=hir.harvard.edu).
Beyond economic motivations, nations such as the United States, Russia,
and China are competing in the region to project military supremacy and
seek more power.]{.underline} The Arctic also sits at a critical
position between North America and Eurasia, making it a powerful
strategic position from which to project military strength. As the
liberal international order is increasingly under threat by great power
conflict (a scenario in which the already-contentious relationship among
the United States, Russia and China could devolve into war), the Arctic
Circle faces a crossroads: will the underlying boiling tensions explode
to the point of larger global conflict or can diplomatic means be the
key to ensuring peace in the region?

[A 2018 National Aeronautics and Space
Administration [report](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2811/2018-arctic-summertime-sea-ice-minimum-extent-tied-for-sixth-lowest-on-record/?ref=hir.harvard.edu) estimated
that the Arctic has lost 21,000 square miles of sea ice per year in the
last five decades, opening up more territory on the narrowing strip of
land for controlling and cultivating. Control over Arctic territory has
given nations the ability to settle it, extract resources, and establish
military outposts, making legal rights and claims over such territory
incredibly valuable.]{.underline} Most legal matters concerning the
region are determined by The Arctic Council: an intergovernmental
organization that encourages cooperation in the region. Its key nation
members are those that border the Arctic: the United States of America,
Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.
Currently, Russia and Canada
have [claimed](https://www.livescience.com/who-owns-the-arctic.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu) the
most land in the region, which is demonstrative of the scope of their
influence in the region. Beyond the eight neighboring countries, there
are also thirteen [observer
countries](https://arctic-council.org/en/about/observers/non-arctic-states?ref=hir.harvard.edu) affiliated
with the Arctic Council, such as China, Germany, and India. The
difference in roles between member nations and observer countries, in
many cases, can be seen in their stated reasons for being in the region.
For example, the United States and Russia have previously justified
their territorial expansion due to their proximity to the region, while
China is more explicit about resources motivating their involvement in
the [region](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/2019/08/how-climate-change-is-setting-the-stage-for-the-new-arctic-cold-war-feature/?ref=hir.harvard.edu).
[The combination of a finite, yet growing amount of claimable territory
as well as the perception of a zero-sum game have set these nations on a
collision course for potential conflict. Consequently, the Arctic
Council works to resolve disputes by publishing agreements and focusing
on sustainability and environmental protection of the Arctic. The
melting polar ice caps and ensuing territorial debates have set the
stage for the magnification of the Arctic Council's global
role.]{.underline}

[The competition over land claims is driven in part by nations\' desire
for the region's natural resources, specifically natural gas, which
provides almost a quarter of all global energy usage. Most natural gas
supplies around the world have already been ]{.underline}[explored and
exploited](https://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/features/feature-the-worlds-biggest-natural-gas-reserves/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)[,
but the Arctic presents a vast untapped reserve over which nations are
vying for control. A US Geological
Survey ]{.underline}[estimates](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3049/fs2008-3049.pdf?ref=hir.harvard.edu)[ that
the region has 1,699 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and various
other fuels, equal to the entirety of Russia's oil reserves and three
times as much as those of the United States.]{.underline}

# Impacts

#### Capitalism and neocolonialism work in tandem to entrench global inequality --- Arctic policy proves how capitalist expansion masks domination as development, enabling powerful states like the U.S. to exploit peripheral regions under the guise of progress while perpetuating systemic oppression.

[Arctic peoples were affected by colonialist and capitalist behaviors
long before the theories were conceptualized. The red thread of these
theories has been consistent through time when applied it to the Arctic
region and Arctic peoples. Historically, powerful nations sought after
the region to establish control, presence, opportunities, and capital.
Today, the motivations are similar in the Arctic, and are driven by
capitalist behaviors. The U.S. is a known capitalist actor in the
Arctic, as it provides considerable investments in sustainable
development, infrastructure development, and increased collaboration
with the Arctic region, especially in Alaska and Greenland. A capitalist
point of view would describe this situation as one that offers an
international presence and capital gain opportunities. A neocolonialist
would see the region as an opportunity for securitization, military
presence, and economic possibilities.]{.underline} Kevin Hillmer-Pegram
comments that "this maximization is the central motivation of
capitalism" (HillmerPegram, 2016, p. 21). [Neocolonialist and Capitalist
theories work together as both theories side with the benefiting of
powerful nations, in turn, oppressing the less powerful and dependent
states. Although stimulating the world economy and the Arctic region's
market system, there are many cons to the capitalist approach in
IR.]{.underline}

Hillmer-Pegram believes that through [the exposure of natural resources,
trading routes, tourism, and infrastructure opportunities that
capitalism funds, ecological and social problems are created in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Hillmer-Pegram, 2016). Richard Peet, Paul Robbins,
and Michael Watts further by saying the resource-eating,
energy-intensive, and polluting history of capitalism detracts from the
environmental and social sustainability of the region in the long-term.
(Peet et al., 2011 p. 18. as cited in Hillmer-Pegram, 2016, p.22). Many
scholars believe in the radical political economy which focuses on the
social injustices and environmental damage that coincide with the
methods of production and consumption of capitalism, and strive for
injustices to be addressed (Foster 1999, 2002; Harvey, 1982, 1996;
O'Connor, 1988; Smith, 1984; Wallerstein, 1979; and HillmerPegram, 2016,
p.20). [Arctic inhabitants who are disposed and affected by exploitation
of their resources are alienated from their culture, society, and
nature]{.underline} (Hillmer-Pegram, 2016, p. 21). [These effects of
capitalist behaviors in the Arctic can be categorized by human security
issues.]{.underline} The next section will discuss Securitization theory
and its links to capitalism and neocolonialism.

#### Neoliberal capitalism will produce extinction -- the system reproduces crises that depoliticize the left, undermine futural thought, and postpone its demise -- the impacts are environmental collapse, endless war, and the rise of fascism

panpsychism, capitalism, affect and subjectivity. He earned a PhD from
Yale in 1981. "No Speed Limit: Three Essays on Accelerationism"
<https://track5.mixtape.moe/qdkkdt.pdf> rvs)

The problem may be summarized as follows. [Capitalism has indeed created
the conditions for general prosperity and therefore for its own
supersession. But it has also blocked, and continues to block, any hope
of realizing this transformation. We cannot wait for capitalism to
transform on its own, but we also cannot hope to progress by appealing
to some radical Outside or by fashioning ourselves as militants faithful
to some "event" that]{.underline} (as Badiou has it) [would mark a
radical and complete break with the given "situation" of
capitalism.]{.underline} Accelerationism rather demands a movement
against and outside capitalism---but on the basis of tendencies and
technologies that are intrinsic to capitalism. [Audre Lord famously
argued that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's
house." But what if the master's tools are the only ones
available?]{.underline} Accelerationism grapples with this dilemma. What
is the appeal of [accelerationism]{.underline} today? It [can be
understood as a response to the particular social and political
situation in which we currently seem to be trapped: that of a long-term,
slow-motion catastrophe**. Global warming, and environmental pollution
and degradation, threaten to undermine our whole mode of
life.**]{.underline} [And this mode of life is itself increasingly
stressful and precarious, due to the depredations of neoliberal
capitalism.]{.underline} As Fredric Jameson puts it, [the world today is
characterized by "heightened polarization, increasing unemployment,
\[and\] the ever more desperate search for new investments and new
markets."]{.underline} These are all general features of capitalism
identified by Marx, but in neoliberal society we encounter them in a
particularly pure and virulent form. I want to be as specific as
possible in my use of the term "neoliberalism" in order to describe this
situation. I define neoliberalism as a specific mode of capitalist
production (Marx), and form of governmentality (Foucault), that is
characterized by the following specific factors: 1. The dominating
influence of financial institutions, which facilitate transfers of
wealth from everybody else to the already extremely wealthy (the "One
Percent" or even the top one hundredth of one percent). 2. The
privatization and commodification of what used to be common or public
goods (resources like water and green space, as well as public services
like education, communication, sewage and garbage disposal, and
transportation). 3. The extraction, by banks and other large
corporations, of a surplus from all social activities: not only from
production (as in the classical Marxist model of capitalism) but from
circulation and consumption as well. [Capital accumulation proceeds not
only by direct exploitation but also by rent-seeking, by debt
collection, and by outright expropriation]{.underline} ("primitive
accumulation"). 4. [The subjection of all aspects of life to the
so-called discipline of the market. This is equivalent]{.underline}, in
more traditional Marxist terms[, to the "real subsumption" by capital of
all aspects of life: leisure as well as labor.]{.underline} Even our
sleep is now organized in accordance with the imperatives of production
and capital accumulation. 5. The redefinition of human beings as private
owners of their own "human capital." [Each person is
thereby]{.underline}, as Michel Foucault puts it, [forced to become "an
entrepreneur of himself."]{.underline} In such circumstances, we are
continually obliged to market ourselves, to "brand" ourselves, to
maximize the return on our "investment" in ourselves. There is never
enough: like the Red Queen, we always need to keep running, just to stay
in the same place. [Precarity is the fundamental condition of our lives.
All of these processes work on a global scale; they extend far beyond
the level of immediate individual experience. My life is precarious, at
every moment, but I cannot apprehend the forces that make it so. I know
how little money is left from my last paycheck, but I cannot grasp, in
concrete terms, how "the economy" works. I directly experience the daily
weather, but I do not directly experience the climate. Global warming
and worldwide financial networks are examples of]{.underline} what the
ecological theorist Timothy Morton calls [hyperobjects.]{.underline}
They are phenomena that actually exist but that "stretch our ideas of
time and space, since they far outlast most human time scales, or
they're massively distributed in terrestrial space and so are
unavailable to immediate experience." Hyperobjects affect everything
that we do, but we cannot point to them in specific instances. [The
chains of causality are far too complicated and intermeshed for us to
follow.]{.underline} In order to make sense of our condition, we are
forced to deal with difficult abstractions. We have to rely upon data
that are gathered in massive quantities by scientific instruments and
then collated through mathematical and statistical formulas but that are
not directly accessible to our senses. We find ourselves, as Mark Hansen
puts it, entangled "within networks of media technologies that operate
predominantly, if not almost entirely, outside the scope of human modes
of awareness (consciousness, attention, sense perception, etc.)." We
cannot imagine such circumstances in any direct or naturalistic way, but
only through the extrapolating lens of science fiction. [Subject to
these conditions, we live under relentless environmental and financial
assault.]{.underline} We continually find ourselves in what might well
be called a state of crisis. However, this involves a paradox. [A
crisis---whether economic, ecological, or political---is a turning
point, a sudden rupture, a sharp and immediate moment of
reckoning.]{.underline} But for us today, [crisis has become a chronic
and seemingly permanent condition. We live, oxymoronically, in a state
of perpetual, but never resolved, convulsion and contradiction. Crises
never come to a culmination; instead, they are endlessly and
indefinitely deferred.]{.underline} For instance, [after the economic
collapse of 2008, the big banks were bailed out by the United States
government. This allowed them to resume the very
practices]{.underline}---the creation of arcane financial instruments,
in order to enable relentless rent-seeking---**[that led to the
breakdown of the economic system in the first place.]{.underline}** [The
functioning of the system is restored, but only in such a way as to
guarantee the renewal of the same crisis, on a greater scale, further
down the road.]{.underline} Marx rightly noted that crises are endemic
to capitalism. But far from threatening the system as Marx hoped, today
[these crises actually help it to renew itself.]{.underline} As David
Harvey puts it, [it is precisely "through the destruction of the
achievements of preceding eras by way of war, the devaluation of assets,
the degradation of productive capacity, abandonment and other forms of
'creative destruction'" that capitalism creates "a new basis for
profit-making and surplus absorption."]{.underline} What lurks behind
this analysis is the frustrating sense of an impasse. Among its other
accomplishments, [neoliberal capitalism has also robbed us of the
future. For it turns everything into an eternal present.]{.underline}
The highest values of our society---as preached in the business
schools---are novelty, innovation, and creativity. And yet these always
only result in more of the same. How often have we been told that a
minor software update "changes everything"? [Our society seems to
function]{.underline}, as Ernst Bloch once put it, [in a state of "sheer
aimless infinity and incessant changeability; where everything ought to
be constantly new, everything remains just as it was." This is because,
in our current state of affairs, the future exists only in order to be
colonized and made into an investment opportunity.]{.underline} John
Maynard Keynes sought to distinguish between risk and genuine
uncertainty. Risk is calculable in terms of probability, but genuine
uncertainty is not. Uncertain events are irreducible to probabilistic
analysis, because "there is no scientific basis on which to form any
calculable probability whatever." Keynes's discussion of uncertainty has
strong affinities with Quentin Meillassoux's account of hyperchaos. For
Meillassoux, there is no "totality of cases," no closed set of all
possible states of the universe. Therefore, there is no way to assign
fixed probabilities to these states. This is not just an empirical
matter of insufficient information; uncertainty exists in principle. For
Meillassoux and Keynes alike, there comes a point where "we simply do
not know." But today, Keynes's distinction is entirely ignored. [The
Black-Scholes Formula and the Efficient Market Hypothesis both conceive
the future entirely in probabilistic terms.]{.underline} In these
theories, as in the actual financial trading that is guided by them (or
at least rationalized by them), [the genuine unknowability of the future
is transformed into a matter of calculable, manageable
risk.]{.underline} True novelty is excluded, because all possible
outcomes have already been calculated and paid for in terms of the
present. While this belief in the calculability of the future is
delusional, it nonetheless determines the way that financial markets
actually work. We might therefore say that speculative finance is the
inverse---and the complement---of the "affirmative speculation" that
takes place in science fiction. Financial speculation seeks to capture,
and shut down, the very same extreme potentialities that science fiction
explores. Science fiction is the narration of open, unaccountable
futures; derivatives trading claims to have accounted for, and
discounted, all these futures already. [The
"market"---]{.underline}nearly deified in neoliberal doctrine---thus
works preemptively, as a global practice of what Richard Grusin calls
premediation. It [seeks to deplete the future in advance. Its relentless
functioning makes it nearly impossible for us to conceive of any
alternative to the global capitalist world order. Such is the condition
that Mark Fisher calls capitalist realism.]{.underline} As Fisher puts
it, channeling both Jameson and Žižek, ["it's easier to imagine the end
of the world than the end of capitalism."]{.underline}

**[The world we live in today is in a dire state]{.underline}**. Climate
destruction continues at a fast pace, and every with every passing day,
capitalism proves itself to be incapable of addressing this. [Capitalist
production and its endless drive for resources to match artificial
market demands has created a climate crisis that leaves us on the brink
of potential extinction]{.underline}.

[Governments around the world are turning to far right and fascist
leaders to assuage their fears of an uncertain future]{.underline}, [and
the most marginalized and oppressed suffer because of it]{.underline}.
Fascism is on the rise, and history tells us very clearly what that can
result in without opposition.

The decaying US empire continues to lash out in violence across the
globe in a desperate attempt to re-assert its power and hegemony. [Whole
countries are destroyed in its desperate bids for more fossil
fuels]{.underline}. The world burns from America's white phosphorus
weaponry.

**[The need for a revolutionary movement capable of replacing capitalism
with something better has never been so clear]{.underline}**. The choice
between socialism or barbarism has never been so stark. [More and more
people are starting to realize that reform cannot save us]{.underline},
[that capitalism and imperialism themselves are the
problem]{.underline}, [and that we must unite and band together to fight
for a better world]{.underline}.

The question then is: [how will we know what strategies]{.underline},
[what tactics]{.underline}, [and what ideas to unite
around?]{.underline} If the skeptics and postmodernists are correct that
knowledge is always relative and localized, then we cannot built a
global and universal strategy to unite around. If they are correct then
we are doomed to small acts of localized or individual resistance in the
face of apocalypse. To embrace such a vision of the world (with its
accompanying epistemological skepticism) is to embrace defeat.

[The masses do not want to embrace defeat]{.underline}, **[they want to
know how to fight back]{.underline}**. Marxism can provide the tools
necessary to engage in that fight.

Marxism, with its self criticism and its insistence on incorporating the
valuable ideas of its critics has created a means for unifying workers
across the globe with anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The
Marxist belief in the possibility of true ideas, tested and verified in
practice, creates the possibility for unity on a global scale. The
scientific status of Marxism means that as our climate changes, as our
world looks more and more grim, Marxism will adapt through struggle and
practice; it will provide us with the ideas and tools we need to fight
and win.

There will be no victory for the workers of the world without the
ability to wield a revolutionary science. [What is at stake in questions
of Marxist epistemology is the very possibility of creating a
philosophical and scientific basis for revolution]{.underline}. **[We
must defend this possibility]{.underline}**. We must defend the
scientific status of Marxism, and must insist on the possibility of
victory.

**[Extinction lies at the heart of capitalist
accumulation.]{.underline}** [Today's debate about planetary crisis has
yielded the concepts of the Anthropocene and the Capitalocene. Both
recognize extinction but have yet to grasp its ontological
significance---for humanity or for capi- talism.]{.underline} What I
wish to propose is that we recognize the Necrocene---or "New Death"---as
a fundamental biogeological moment of our era: the Capitalocene. **[The
Necrocene reframes the history of capitalism's expan- sion through the
process of becoming extinction]{.underline}**. [The accumulation of
capital is the accumulation potential extinction---a potential
increasingly activated in recent decades]{.underline}. [**This becoming
extinction is not simply the biological process of species extinction**.
It is also the extinguishing of cultures and languages, either through
force or assimilation; it is the extermination of peoples, either
through labor or deliberate murder; it is the extinction of the earth in
the depletion fossil fuels, rare earth minerals, even the chemical
element helium; it is ocean acidification and eutrophication,
deforestation and desertification, melting ice sheets and rising sea
levels; the great Pacific garbage patch and nuclear waste entombment;
McDonalds and Monsanto.]{.underline} Here [the process of Necrosis is
central. Unlike apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death
beneficial to the organism, Necrosis is born of traumatic injury.
Necrosis proceeds by autolysis, a form of self-digestion in which a cell
destroys itself through its own enzymes action.]{.underline} Capitalism
is the reciprocal transmutation of life into death and death into
capital. [Necrosis is capital's mode of apoptosis, reproducing the means
of pro- duction by its destruction. It is both saprophytic and
parasitic: it feeds on live and dead nature the same; it seeks to render
them indistinguishable. From the standpoint of the Necrocene, capital
appears as a species, an opportunistic detritus feeder producing mass
extinction in the present through the exploitation of past
extinctions.]{.underline} The more capitalism exerts its planetary power
through the intensification of surplus extraction from Cheap Natures
(Moore 2015a),2 the more it necrotizes the world-ecology it has created.
The Necrocene is the Capitalocene's shadow double, the future past of
its necromancy, its monstrous sublime and uncanny paradox. **[Extinction
is the both the immediate success and ultimate failure of the real
subsump- tion of the earth by capital;]{.underline}** **[the ecology of
capital is constructed through attempted erasure of existing
ecologies---ecologies that include humans.]{.underline}** Nothing
embodies the reciprocal conditioning between the Capitalocene and the
Necrocene more than fossil fuels. **[Even if the Cheap Natures of
charcoal fueled capital's monstrous appetite long before fossil fuels
became a general form of energy use, early modern deforestation quickly
induced a shift from "shallow" to "deep" time.]{.underline}** By the
nineteenth century, world accumulation came to depend upon fossil
fuels---the appropria- tion of the deep-time decay of life. Here the
Necrocene, but an embryonic omen at the start of the Capitalocene,
becomes actualized in capital's novel conscription of deep time. **[The
argument for the Necrocene flows from a view of capitalism as
world-ecology, in which capital accumulation is understood as
fundamentally embedded in, and shaped by, the web of life]{.underline}**
(see Moore 2015a; also Parenti and Hartley's essays in this volume). The
Necrocene highlights the relation between capital accumulation and
negative-value. That latter encompasses those forms of nature that are
directly hostile to capital accumulation, and which cannot be overcome
through capital's productiv- ist logic. Questions of waste and toxicity
loom large in Moore's account, including of course the rising
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But waste and
toxification are only part of the reality sug- gested by the "rise of
negative-value" (Moore 2015b). Extinction must be conceptualized in
relation to the *longue durée* of capitalism. We have, it seems, reached
a historical tipping point of negative-value accumulation. **[The
nonlinear reproduction of negative-value has clearly become an urgent
problem---for capital as well as for planetary life. The "entwinement"
of climate change and capital has produced a new con- tradiction in
negative-value: "processes of extracting nature's 'free gifts'
(including human labor) and toxifying the biosphere (including humans)
have now reached a breaking point."]{.underline}** While negative-value
accumulation might become more apparent with capital's increasingly
frantic efforts to appropriate surplus value and restore Cheap Nature,
its history is rooted in the origins of capitalism (Moore 2015b, 5). The
Necrocene, coterminous with the Capitalocene, is the slow emergence of
the crisis of negative- value accumulation. The Necrocene concept traces
the relation between the material unfolding of extinction through
capital and the history of its scientific inquiry. **[That is why
extinction must be examined through exhumation of dead matter: as an
object of knowledge, the fossils that led to the discovery of extinction
and the concept of catastrophism, and the decayed biomass of
hydrocarbons whose use precipitates actual ecological
catastrophe.]{.underline}** Dead matter is our link to the seeming
oblivion of deep time. Through its inspection, we can learn something
about our own future catastrophes. The earth is wracked by punctuated
cataclysms---subterranean, extrater- restrial, and biological---a
press-pulse of species extirpations and radia- tions (Arens and West
2008). Today we look for analogies for our present epoch in strange
hyphenated names: the contemporary mass extinction found in the
Permian-Triassic "Great Dying"; the explosive rise of CO2 ppm in the
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum; life's geological agency in the Great
Oxygenation Event of 2.5 billion years ago, when cyanobacte- rial
photosynthesis triggered perhaps life's first "climate catastrophe."3 In
what follows, we make sense of the Necrocene in four stages. I begin
with the "Columbian exchange" that accompanied the conquest of the
Americas after 1492 (Crosby 1972). Pangea was restored through the
intercontinental and transoceanic exchanges of crops, humans, animals---
and commodities. The decimation of indigenous populations made for
another "discovery": the idea of extinction. Extinction became a problem
of knowledge. Second, the reorganization of capital through scientific
management and fossil fuel extraction made extinction an apparent
problem: one that needed "stewardship." Capitalism's dialectic of
accumu- lation and extinction coevolved with a conceptualization of
knowledge of "risk" and "environment." Capitalism did not ignore
environmental risk; it made it the central problem of its survival.
Third, the post-World War II "Great Acceleration" witnessed the
convergence of financial, actuarial, military strategic, and
environmental risk around biosecurity. These emerged primarily from the
problems of nuclear warfare and the envi- ronmental consequences of
nuclear testing. Finally, biosecurity disap- peared into catastrophic
nihilism and the embrace of necrosis; the "sur- vival economy" of
neoliberalism as the Donner Party. The belief in our alienation from
nature became embodied in the perspective of the human being as the
monstrous all-powerful offspring *of nature*. The problem of extinction
was rendered intrinsic to human nature rather than to capital.4 The
history of environmentalism is the history of capitalism realizing its
own principle of *becoming extinction* through the conceptual system of
planetary catastrophism*. This in turn produced a being toward
extinction as a permanent characteristic.* **[The "Anthropocene"
displaces the origins of the contemporary crisis onto the human being as
species rather than as capital. It reinforces what capital wants to
believe of itself: that human "nature," not capital, has pre- cipitated
today's planetary instability]{.underline}**. [The Anthropocene says
"humanity" put the earth under its power, that it could either save or
destroy it---yet it also says the unintended consequences of this power
only accelerate our powerlessness over earth's inevitable
revenge.]{.underline} We have mistaken who "we" are (as some kind of
undifferentiated human mass) from what "we" perform through capital. [We
have mistaken a historical condition of our economic organization for an
innate aspect of the human being]{.underline}. Planetary Catastrophism
has become the ideology of capitalism, and in this cata- strophism
begets catastrophe. The more capital attempts the real sub- sumption of
the earth, the more the earth subsumes it. In the Necrocene,
capitalism's farce runs concurrent with its tragedy. We have finally
inverted Benjamin's "Angel of History" (2006). No longer do we blindly
fly along, face turned toward the past in horror as the wreckage builds
and builds; now we hurl forward, ignorant of the past, eyes fixed on
catastrophe upon catastrophe piling up ahead.

#### Capitalism causes extinction---rejection of small adjustments in favor of system change is necessary.

A quick snapshot of the twenty-first century so far: [an economic
meltdown; a frantic sell-off of public land to the energy
business]{.underline} as President George W Bush exited the White House;
[a prolonged]{.underline}, costly, and unjustified [war in Iraq; the
Greek economy in ruins; an escalation of global food prices; bee
colonies in global extinction; 925 million hungry reported]{.underline}
in 2010; as of 2005, the world\'s five hundred richest individuals with
a combined income greater than that of the poorest 416 million people,
[the richest 10 percent accounting for 54 percent of global income; a
planet on the verge of **boiling point**; melting ice caps; increases in
extreme weather conditions; and the list goes on and on]{.underline} and
on.2 [Sounds like a **ticking time bomb**]{.underline}, doesn\'t it?
Well [it is]{.underline}.

[It is shameful to think that **massive die-outs** of future generations
will **put to pale comparison**]{.underline} the 6 million murdered
during the Holocaust; [the millions killed in two world wars; the
genocides in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Darfur; the 1 million
left homeless and the 316,000 killed by the 2010 earthquake in
Haiti]{.underline}. The time has come to wake up to the warning signs.3

The real issue climate change poses is that [we do not enjoy the luxury
of incremental change anymore. We are in the last decade where we can do
something]{.underline} about the situation. Paul [Gilding]{.underline},
the former head of Greenpeace International and [a]{.underline} core
[faculty member of Cambridge University\'s Programme for Sustainability,
explains that \"two degrees of warming is an inadequate goal and a plan
for failure;\']{.underline} adding that \"returning to below one degree
of warming . . . is the solution to the problem:\'4 [Once we move higher
than 2°C of warming, which is what is projected to occur by 2050,
positive feedback mechanisms will begin to kick in, and then we will be
at the **point of no return**. We]{.underline} therefore [need to start
thinking very differently right now]{.underline}.

[We do not see the crisis for what it is; we only see it as an
**isolated symptom** that we need to make a few minor changes to deal
with]{.underline}. This was the message that Venezuela\'s president Hugo
Chavez delivered at the COP15 United Nations Climate Summit in
Copenhagen on December 16, 2009, when he declared: \"Let\'s talk about
the cause. We should not avoid responsibilities, we should not avoid the
depth of this problem. And I\'ll bring it up again, the cause of this
disastrous panorama is the metabolic, destructive system of the capital
and its model: capitalism."5

[The structural conditions in which we operate are advanced
capitalism]{.underline}. Given this fact, [a **few adjustments** here
and there to that system are **not enough** to solve the problems that
climate change and environmental degradation pose]{.underline}.6
[Adaptability, modifications, and displacement]{.underline}, as I have
consistently shown throughout this book, [constitute the **very essence
of capitalism**. Capitalism adapts without doing away with the threat.
Under capitalism, one deals with threat not by challenging it, but by
buying favors from it, as in]{.underline} voluntary [carbon-offset
schemes. In the process, one gives up on one\'s autonomy]{.underline}
and reverts to being a child. Voluntarily [offsetting a bit of carbon
here and there, eating vegan, or recycling]{.underline} our waste,
[although well intended, are not solutions]{.underline} to the problem,
[but a symptom of the free market\'s ineffectiveness]{.underline}. By
casting a scathing look at the neoliberal options on display, I have
tried to show how all these options are ineffective. We are not buying
indulgences because we have a choice; choices abound, and yet they all
lead us down one path and through the golden gates of capitalist heaven.

For these reasons, I have underscored everyone\'s implication in this
structure -- myself included. If anything, the book has been an act of
outrage -- outrage at the deceit and the double bind that the
\"choices\" under capitalism present, for [there is no choice when
everything is expendable]{.underline}. There is nothing substantial
about the future when all you can do is survive by facing the absence of
your own future and by sharing strength, stamina, and courage with the
people around you. All the rest is false hope.

In many respects, writing this book has been an anxious exercise because
I am fully aware that reducing the issues of environmental degradation
and climate change to the domain of analysis can stave off the
institution of useful solutions. But in my defense I would also like to
propose that [each and every one of us has certain skills that can
contribute to making the solutions that we introduce in response to
climate change and environmental degradation more effective and more
realistic]{.underline}. In light of that view, I close with the
following proposition, which I mean in the most optimistic sense
possible: [our politics must start from the point that after 2050 it may
all be over]{.underline}.

[The idea of a **global extinction triangle** linking **capitalism**,
**environmental destruction**]{.underline} ([including **climate
change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity collapse**]{.underline}),
[and **militarism**]{.underline} ([especially **nuclear
war)**]{.underline} will be viewed [in many **nations**, and especially
the United States]{.underline}, as itself madness. It is so taboo that
most [**analysts** of **climate crisis**, **pandemics** such as
**COVID-19**, and **nuclear war**]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline}
indeed [much of the **climate** and **peace** movements]{.underline} --
[avoid the **subject** of the **capitalist system** and the need for
**systemic transformation**]{.underline} like the plague.

To take just climate, the notion that the capitalist system drives
climate change is highlighted by only a few leading analysts, mainly on
the Left. One is Naomi Klein, who argues that extinction arises from
"the collision between capitalism and the planet" and that:

[We have not **done**]{.underline} the [things]{.underline} that are
[necessary to lower **emissions** because those things **fundamentally
conflict** with **deregulated capitalism**]{.underline}, the reigning
ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out
of this crisis. [We are **stuck** because the actions that would give us
the **best chance** of averting **catastrophe**]{.underline} -- and
would benefit the vast majority -- [are **extremely threatening** to an
**elite minority** that has a **stranglehold**]{.underline} over our
economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets.2

Klein acknowledges that "autocratic industrial socialism" can also cause
climate change, but argues that [the ruling **capitalist m**odel is the
**major risk** and we need to pursue a **democratic "eco-socialism**" to
save the planet]{.underline}.

Joining Klein in the laser-like but lonely focus on the capitalist DNA
driving extinction is the journalist, George Monbiot. He writes that:

Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is failing as
catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism, it is beset
by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently corrupt and
corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast infrastructure of
thought that seeks to justify it, makes any challenge to the model
almost impossible to contemplate. Even to acknowledge the emergencies it
causes, let alone to act on them, feels like electoral suicide. As the
famous saying goes: "It is easier to imagine the end of the world than
to imagine the end of capitalism." Our urgent task is to turn this the
other way round.3

Monbiot is not joking when he says our most important task is to "turn
this the other way round." While this sounds daunting, imagining
systemic change in the global capitalist economy has become essential to
human survival. In a period when there is a new awakening about
"systemic racism," we need now to expand our consciousness about our
economy, recognizing that we are now living in a new stage of
"extinction capitalism." Only systemic change in our political economy
can save us.

Klein is Canadian and Monbiot is British. These are both societies where
it has long been possible to offer critiques of capitalism without
sounding like a crackpot. Both Britain and Canada have labor or
socialist parties, and mainstreamed the idea that large parts of the
society should be separated from profitmaking and organized for the
provision of public goods. These societies are less complicit than the
United States in climate and military policies fueling extinction.

In the United States, mainstream socialist political parties do not
exist, and "big government" and universal welfare programs are seen as
enemies of liberty, with the exception of an enormous military. Klein
and Monbiot have an audience in the United States, but their views that
to survive means moving beyond capitalism and especially neoliberalism
capitalism runs into huge hurdles, especially in American political
discourse, even among liberals. However, we shall see that it is not an
impossible dream, and that even a President as moderate as Joe Biden,
pushed by people of color, young people, and social movements, has begun
to break with neoliberalism and shift toward a public goods economy that
could help save the planet.

Crossing the Threshold: Humanity Confronts Its Final Stage

Beginning in the mid-1940s, when the United States attacked Japan with
nuclear weapons, we saw the emergence of the first period in human
history -- now known as the Anthropocene -- in which capitalism began to
threaten both nuclear and climate extinction. As Noam Chomsky writes:
Review of the record reveals clearly that escape from catastrophe for
seventy years has been a near miracle and such miracles cannot be
trusted to perpetuate.

On that grim day in August 1945, humanity entered into a new era, the
nuclear age. It's one that's unlikely to last long, either we will bring
it to an end or it's likely to bring us to an end. It was evident at
once that any hope of containing the demon would require international
corporation ....

It was not understood at the time but a second and no less critical new
era was beginning at the same time. A new geological epoch, by now,
called the Anthropocene--an epoch defined by extreme human impact on the
environment.

The Anthropocene and the nuclear age coincide, a dual threat to the
perpetuation of organized human life. Both threats are severe and
imminent. It's widely recognized that we have entered the period of the
sixth mass extinction.4

Extinction denialism has limited public awareness of the new stage that
arose in the late 1940s but is rooted in the foundations of our economic
system. Indeed, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, even as it [**historically
helped** build new economic **growth** and innovation]{.underline} and
pulled millions out of poverty, has always created war and environmental
destruction. [Its **historical progress** fueled
"**development**]{.underline}" that catapulted the European and American
world [toward **prosperity**]{.underline} and material well-being for
two centuries. [But that **huge leap**]{.underline} forward also
[**froze** into society an **unsustainable quest** for **unfettered
growth** threatening **military** and **environmental
catastrophe**]{.underline} and externalized multiple costs onto the
peoples of the Global South. The history of capitalist successes
disguised latent crises now surfacing in the extinction stage. The
historical benefits of capitalism have not disappeared, but their
relative value has declined compared to the costs and risks --
ultimately of extinction.

The Triangle of Extinction: Mad Money

To save humanity and all life on the planet, we need to understand the
new extinction stage as rooted in a causal triangle of three intertwined
threats. The only way that humanity will survive is if the world --
including all states, peoples, and social movements -- come together to
dismantle the triangle and create a new circle of sustainable life
systems.

[Capitalism]{.underline} drives the triangle of extinction. Its very
nature, as a system, [foments **militarism** and drives **environmental
destruction**]{.underline}. In Chapter 2, we argue that capitalism's
constant need to expand both its resource base and its markets fosters a
militarism to pry open markets and "protect" investments. Territorial
expansion across national borders has a corollary in the capitalist
dynamic to test and break ecological thresholds, producing the third
corner of the triangle, environmental destruction.

However, these two corners -- [**militarism** and **environmental
destruction**]{.underline} also [feed back into]{.underline}, affect,
and reinforce [the logic of capitalism. Both create the **disasters**
that leave **communities** and **states** turning to
**capitalists**]{.underline} for solutions. The **[soil fertility
depletion]{.underline}**, for example, [that **capitalist agriculture**
produces, leaves us all more **dependent** on the **petrochemical** and
**agro-industrial** corporations selling **fertilizers** and
**pesticides**]{.underline}. Similarly, [capitalism's **inherent
instability**]{.underline}, particularly in the American case, [produces
a "**military Keynesianism**," using **state spending** to increase
**production** and **profits**]{.underline} of military companies.
[This, in turn, compromises **democracy**, giving **weapons
contractors** privileged **access to the state**, rendering the latter
**dependent** on the "**market" fortunes**]{.underline} of these
corporations (Figure 1.1).

As we contemplate this triangle, we must recognize that its dynamics
play out in social and historical structures that are profoundly
intersectional, ones characterized at the global, regional, and national
levels by evolving hierarchies including those of race, gender, class,
and states. A more complete picture of the triangle therefore looks like
this (Figure 1.2).

This second diagram spells out the variety of forms of environmental
destruction and militarism that create existential and extinction
threats, whether they be, in Bostrom's terms, forms of bang, crunch,
shriek, or whimper risks. In both pictures, we are adhering to the idea
that existential threats -- and extinction itself -- should not be
defined exclusively as total annihilation.

The second picture shows that [there are several **major existential
risks**; among the risks in]{.underline} the [**environmental
destruction** corner are]{.underline} three well-known ones, [**climate
change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity** loss]{.underline}. But
these interact with the others listed, as well as with the many other
risks that are less well known. Similarly, [militarism produces
**nuclear**, **biological**/**chemical**, and **cyberwar**
risks]{.underline}. [All of these]{.underline} six varieties of
existential risk are extremely important, and all [are
"systemic]{.underline}" in that they are partly caused and fueled by the
United States and global capitalist system. [All deserve
urgent]{.underline} study leading to [emergency transformative
change]{.underline} because each of them could create devastating mass
death from which humanity might not be able to recover. In addition to
these six existential risks, the clusters around each corner of the
second diagram also name other risks that may escalate into either
existential risks or radically re- duce the quality of life and pose
civilizational risks.

In this book, mainly to keep the book shorter, we do not analyze
biodiversity collapse, cyber war, or biological war, focusing instead on
nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics. If we were to write a second
volume, we would analyze with the same sense of urgency the other three
incredibly dangerous threats; they are growing and increasingly
intertwined with the threats we focus on here.

The arrows in the diagrams reflect causation. Capitalism itself creates
a threat of extinction, independent of environmental death and war. But
it also causes and fuels the environmental threats of climate change,
pandemics, and loss of biodiversity, which multiply the extinction
threat. And [capitalism]{.underline}, [especially the **militarized
hegemonic form**]{.underline} modeled by US neoliberal capitalism,
causes war, which [further **multiplies** the extinction threat embedded
in the **possibility** of nuclear war. Climate change, pandemics, and
extreme war could arise from other systems than capitalism, but
**capitalism** is a **leading cause** and accelerator of all these
**threats**]{.underline}, which in turn intensify the extinction dangers
of each other. [Climate change is a **major driver** of war]{.underline}
and war has become a leading cause of climate change. [Scholarship on
**climate change** and]{.underline} broader **[environmental
matters]{.underline}** typically [recognize several major **tipping
points** and environmental thresholds beyond which **abrupt** and
**catastrophic outcomes** are to be **expected**]{.underline}. While we
do explore these in depth, we consider these important aspects of the
three corners of the triangle of extinction.5

## Climate Change Impacts 

#### The structure of capitalism motors climate change, destroys social life, and also incentivizes genocide -- growth will always come first which locks in climate destruction.

**Gunderson and Fyock 21** (Ryan and Claiton, Department of Sociology
and Gerontology, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA; Leicester Law
School, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK, "The Political Economy
of Climate Change Litigation: Is There a Point to Suing Fossil Fuel
Companies?" 2021)

The first fundamental assumption of this paper's arguments is that
**[capitalism]{.underline}**, [due to its growth dependency**, is a
major driver of climate change and it is a system that cannot be
'greened'**]{.underline} (e.g. Foster et al. 2010, Antonio and Clark
2015, Klein 2015). In other words, (1) [capitalism requires economic
growth and (2) economic growth increases greenhouse gas
emissions.]{.underline} We summarise each argument in turn. Capitalism
requires growth in part due to the private economic control of the means
of production, legally legitimated through the institution of private
property rights. Private control of the means of production is one of
the foundations of the profit motive and capitalism's unique elevation
of profit-maximisation and economic production to ends (as opposed to
means to an end): '\[a\]ccumulation for the sake of accumulation,
production for the sake of production' (Marx 1976, p. 742). In such an
economic system, corporations have no choice but to compete with one
another, which leads to constant investment in new technologies, the
expansion of markets, and other measures to increase profitability.
Corporations' surpluses must be reinvested into an expansion of their
production process or they run the risk of failure or takeover from a
larger corporation. While spectacular PR campaigns boast that
corporations are adopting a 'triple bottom line' model that serves the
'three pillars of sustainability' (economic prosperity, social
development, ecological sustainability), the reality is that, when these
three pillars conflict, **[growth will always take priority over social
needs and environmental health for structural reasons]{.underline}**
(Clark et al. 2018). Moreover, [ostensible 'green' measures do little
more than mask business as usual]{.underline} (Wright and Nyberg 2015).
[These structural imperatives that increase production and consumption
depend on increases in material and energy flows, which increases
emissions]{.underline}. **[The link between economic growth and
emissions is clear: 1 per cent increase in GDP growth is associated with
0.5--0.7 per cent increase in emissions]{.underline}** (Burke et al.
2015). [While the 'green growth' paradigm assumes that an absolute
decoupling between growth and emissions is possible through energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and other means, keeping global
temperature rise within 1.5°C or 2°C above preindustrial levels while
maintaining constant economic growth is 'beyond what existing empirical
models indicate is feasible']{.underline} (Hickel and Kallis 2019, p.
11; see also Schor and Jorgenson 2019). Yet '[green growth' and related
ideas gain currency in a specific political-economic context, where
**capitalist imperatives and effects constrain what policy responses to
climate change are considered 'realistic'**]{.underline} (e.g. carbon
markets; see Lohmann 2005, Newell and Paterson 2010) and shape the
organisation and outcomes of global climate governance (Parks and
Roberts 2010). The second fundamental assumption presupposed in our
assessment of private climate litigation is that **[corporate actions
are strongly conditioned by capitalist imperatives.]{.underline}**
Although the early formulation of 'structural Marxism' by Althusser and
others was far too deterministic and ahistorical -- and missed Marx's
central point that humanity is dominated by its own creations through
historically contingent and socially determined practices --, this line
of thought was right about the following arguments: classes are
objective (though changeable) social relations and rooted in the
ownership and control of the means of production and, importantly for
this project, [productive relations strongly condition social
action]{.underline} (for review, see Colvin and Pauly 1983, pp. 525ff;
see below). Structural explanations are neither necessarily
functionalist nor overly deterministic. Wright (1978, pp. 15ff) argues
that social structures influence social action and political and
ideological forms through various 'modes of determination'. For example,
[the forces and relations of production: set limits on the possible
forms of political and ideological structures, and make some of those
possible forms more likely than others, but they do not rigidly
determine in a mechanistic manner any given form of political and
ideological relations]{.underline}. (Wright 1978, p. 16, emphasis added)
We take the following example to be axiomatic throughout the paper:
[under capitalist relations of production, even capitalists, as private
owners of the means of production, are in a relation of competition with
each other which determines the limits on their actions and often
necessitates that certain measures be instituted]{.underline}. Even
monopolistic practices, such as price fixing, are necessitated by the
vicissitudes of capitalist competition. Thus the relations of private
ownership of the means of production set certain constraints on
capitalists as they interact with each other and as they interact with
workers from whom they expropriate surplus labor. (Colvin and Pauly
1983, p. 526) That is, objective social conditions, in this case, the
class structure, limit what possible patterns of action can exist and
increase or decrease the probability of pursuing any given action.
Schnaiberg's (1980) classic 'treadmill of production' model is helpful
for explaining the relations between both fundamental assumptions. His
argument is straightforward: [capitalism is a growthdependent system
that requires an increasing total amount of energy and material
throughput (withdrawals), which also necessarily increases 'additions'
-- in our case emissions -- to the environment]{.underline}. This always
expanding 'treadmill' is structurally necessary yet carried out by
concrete actors who fill preestablished roles, which he calls a 'growth
coalition': capital (especially monopolycapital corporations), the
state, and organised labour. As a key determining actor in this
coalition, giant corporations have a clear structural need to, and
vested interest in, expanding the treadmill due to competition. Before
discussing the cynical capitalist logic of fossil fuel CEOs and other
executives who continue to invest in fossil fuels despite knowing that
they are cooking the planet, Chomsky puts it this way: **[the 'basic
elements of capitalism, both ideological and institutional, lead
directly to destruction of the basis of organized social
life]{.underline}** -- if unconstrained' (in Chomsky and Pollin 2020, p.
53). This point is expanded upon below. Although we are not concerned
with criminal law in this manuscript, work from green criminology that
draws from the treadmill of production and related perspectives further
clarifies **[the relationship between the structure of capitalism and
climate change impacts]{.underline}** (Stretesky et al. 2013, White
2018). Working from a political-economic perspective, some [green
criminologists have argued that climate change and damages associated
with fossil fuel extraction are global harms driven by coordinated
action between powerful state and corporate actors, or, 'state-corporate
crimes']{.underline} (Lynch et al. 2010, 2020, Kramer and Michalowski
2012, Kramer 2020) and 'crimes of the powerful' (White 2015). For
example, drawing from the treadmill of production model, Lynch et al.
(2020) examine **[the links between ecocide and genocide in the context
of oil extraction in Nigeria, where Shell and the Nigerian government
committed 'ecologically induced genocide']{.underline}** (see Crook and
Short 2014) **[against the Ogoni people]{.underline}** (indigenous
Nigerians). Importantly, they emphasise that **[the structure of
capitalism is the underlying driver of 'eco-genocide']{.underline}**. In
other words, [the treadmill of production, which requires continual
fossil fuel inputs, 'promotes' or 'produces' state-corporate
crimes]{.underline}. It is notable that green criminologists have
developed a non-legalistic concept of 'crime', one that emphasises how
the state and corporations 'have the capacity to shape official
definitions of environmental crime in ways that allow, condone, or
excuse environmentally harmful practices' (White 2013, pp. 19--20).
While we do not discuss criminal law in this project, the latter point
is consistent with Marxist theories of law; namely, that law is a social
relation that provides an abstract basis for legal exchange between
individuals (and/or institutions) which often masks these actors'
preexisting material relationships, which may be unequal or harmful
(Pashukanis 2002). As a practice between actors (Poulantzas 1978, p.
68), law maintains the class differences established between property
owners and producers by providing the 'coding' of capitalism (Pistor
2020, p. 13). Indeed, notions of property and ownership are themselves
hardwired into capitalist social relations (Kennedy 1984, p. 993) and
provide a form of social legitimation for class division. It is this
class division that allows for a disparity in who shapes the status quo
of our current global political economy; one which permits corporations
the ability to monopolise industry, transcend national borders, and
avoid accountability for environmental degradation. Not only does
legislation typically side with capital's interests when they are at
stake, environmental legislation may even grease the treadmill (e.g.
conservation to help capital more efficiently use public resources) (see
Schnaiberg 1980, pp. 244ff). To summarise, [capitalism (1) drives
climate change and cannot be greened, at least fast enough to stay
within climate targets; (2) shapes corporate behaviour, including
actions that meet the structural drive to constantly expand; and (3)
sets the parameters in which the law operates]{.underline}. Considering
these structural dynamics, the following section analyzes the case for
suing carbon-intensive industries. We assess their potential
effectiveness for climate mitigation and explicate and critique their
social-theoretical assumptions.

#### There is no way to solve climate change under capitalism. The imperative of capitalist production and expansion is fundamentally in opposition to genuine steps to stop economic activity that destroys the environment.

**McMillan 2012 (Chris. Žižek and communist strategy: On the disavowed
foundations of global capitalism. Edinburgh University Press, 2012.)**

Furthermore, **[any radical political approach that attempts to gain
traction within capitalism hits a limit at capital
itself]{.underline}**. This is the fundamental limitation of the
democratic approach of Laclau and Stavrakakis, or the deconstructionist
ethics of the likes of William Connelly (2002; 2008) and Critchley
(2007b). These theorists are regular critics of Zizek, accusing him of
political impotency. They suggest that Zizek's work holds no political
value because he refuses to partake in political 'activity' within
capitalism. Connelly and Critchley, for example, each argue that we
should 'chip away' at the capitalist structure, making whatever possible
progressive political adjustments within the system. Ultimately they are
**[social democrats, appealing for greater tolerance and environmental
standards]{.underline}**. What these theorists **[fail to understand are
the limits to action posed by capitalism. These limitations are most
clearly evident in responses to climate change. It is clear that the
most overt cause of ecological degradation is the scale of economic
activity, whether in terms of the use of resources, carbon emissions or
species extinction caused by the spread of human activity into new
environments. Therefore, to effectively respond to the problem, the
global economy must be reduced in size]{.underline}**. Yes,
**[technological efficiencies are necessary and of great advantage, but
they are no match for the expansion of the economy, particularly in the
face of a rapidly expanding global population]{.underline}**.
Ultimately, capitalism operates as a system that requires constant
expansion through the development of new markets and new consumers, to
the detriment of everything that comes into its path (Kovel, 2007, pp.
38-47; Marx & Engels, \[1848\] 2004, p. 7). This is a conclusion that
cannot be properly acknowledged within the ideologies that dominate
capitalism, whether conservative, progressive or otherwise. **[Whilst
many environmentalists argue for a reduction in consumption, promoting
events such as 'Buy Nothing Day', they miss the fundamental logic of
capitalism -- that it must continue to expand. Ultimately, any reduction
in consumption will must adversely affect those who produce, those for
whom what is required is a radical growth in economic activity to lift
them out of poverty. This contradiction within capitalism -- that
climate change is caused by the scale of economic activity, yet to
alleviate global poverty the economy must rapidly expand -- signals the
limits of its appeal for true Leftists.]{.underline}** To allow the poor
to develop systems through which to feed themselves at a level that
satisfies human dignity and flourishing, yet save our global ecology
from collapse, it is clear that capitalism must be forced from the
planet. 

## Colonialism Impacts 

#### Colonialism is a multidimensional, evolving system of control tied to capitalist expansion and extractivism --- Arctic development mirrors these logics and perpetuates colonial domination through resource exploitation and racialized hierarchies.

While there are many ways to define colonialism, the term is
characterised by the expansion of a country into a given territory for
the purpose of economic exploitation, usually involving the
establishment of colonies and cultural domination.35 From our
perspective[, western colonialism in the modern world implies an attempt
to incorporate colonial territories into a global system of political,
social and/or economic control. This form of colonialism depends on a
particular understanding of what is perceived as the 'other' -- be it
territory, natural resources or people -- underpinned by dominant
discourses in which western characteristics, practices and ideas are
defined as expressions of civilisation or moral superiority at the
expense of the 'other', thus producing asymmetries in power
dynamics]{.underline}.36 Extractivism and the subjugation of different
groups, among other thingss, are some of the expressions of a long
history of colonial encounters.

[In the case of Antarctica, the absence of an Indigenous population, the
location of the territory and its extreme environmental conditions have
fostered somewhat different approaches to colonialism than those most
commonly assessed in other regions of the world]{.underline}.37
Researchers working from a postcolonial perspective have argued that
there is no reason to assume that the region was not shaped by colonial
practices simply because the relationships at issue were not between the
region and a particular nation that sought to incorporate it as part of
its territory.38 Instead, colonial practices and relations need to be
understood as multidimensional and multidirectional phenomena, within
the framework of a particular attitude toward the 'other' described
above.39

[Since colonialism is neither spatially nor temporally homogeneous, an
assessment of its diversity is required. From a postcolonial
perspective, the focus should not be on the relationship between two
different societies or territories, where one is simply dominant over a
passive other, but on the new practices and connections that have
developed as a result of a complex process that has integrated several
points of the planet into a single logic -- each of which has some kind
of influence on the other]{.underline} (without denying the impact of
power imbalances). According to this, colonialism is a reality that has
manifested in different places, not only those traditionally labelled as
'colonial' but also in other contexts, such as Antarctica. These are
some of the ideas that guide our analysis of the sealing era.

#### Capitalism and colonialism are co-constitutive in exploration --- the ethnocentric domination of the "other" underpins territorial and resource exploitation. The historical example of Antarctica, perceived as remote and empty, was deeply embedded in global systems of capitalist expansion, with economic extraction reinforcing colonial claims.

[The subjugation of what is defined as the 'other' (be it a given
territory, natural resources or people) is inevitably linked to an
ethnocentric view in which there is no possible identification with what
is perceived as different. On the contrary, the 'other' is understood
simply as an object to be dominated. Nevertheless, and in silence, the
'other', defined as an alien reality, inevitably represents the
'constitutive outside']{.underline} (sensu Judith Butler) [that
facilitates the formation of the dominant centre]{.underline}.86 In this
sense, peripheral or ultra-peripheral territories were essential to the
existence of the core regions. For example, the resources extracted from
Antarctica eventually fed the commercial markets of distant regions,
providing the raw materials necessary for an ongoing process of
industrialisation and urbanisation. Although not everyone was aware of
it, the candles that people lit, the oil that they used to lubricate
machines and the furs that they used for clothing sometimes came from
this most remote region of the world. Moreover, the capitals that the
Antarctic sealing industry eventually produced became available for the
development of other capitalist and colonial projects around the world.

[As discussed above, neither economy/exploitation and
knowledge/exploration, nor capitalism and colonialism, should be seen as
mutually exclusive concepts in Antarctic history. On the contrary, both
capitalism and colonialism have played an important role in the
incorporation of Antarctica into the modern world. From this
perspective, capitalism may have laid the foundations for the
development of colonialism in the region,]{.underline} and vice versa.
If we reflect on this point for a moment, the territorial claims that
are currently latent within the ATS, and which are expected eventually
to be based on the sustained presence of national states over the
territory, still have the exploitation of natural resources as a
potential future goal[. The manifestations of colonialism most commonly
associated with Antarctica are not necessarily divorced from economic
dynamics.]{.underline}

[As a global process, colonialism has been closely linked to western
expansion into inhabited and uninhabited territories.]{.underline} The
exclusion of Antarctica from this process simply deepens the
exoticisation of the region, while reducing the possibilities for
dialogue with other contexts. From a critical standpoint, as suggested
by postcolonial approaches, it is possible to understand the
singularities of Antarctica while discussing its connections with the
wider world.

Historical materialism and social change

In very abstract terms, [historical materialism]{.underline} is [a way
to understand historical and contemporary social
formations.]{.underline} It seeks [to **explicate what is** historically
**specific about a dominant mode of production**]{.underline} [within a
particular social formation]{.underline} (Ollman, 1993). A mode of
production can be briefly defined as [the "complex unity]{.underline}"
(Althusser, 2014) [between the productive forces (i.e. means of
production and labor-power) and relations of production]{.underline},
which Bettelheim (1975: 55) defines as a "system of positions assigned
to agents of production in relation to the principal means of
production." Non-economistic Marxists like Lenin, Mao, and so on,
emphasize that the relations of production play the determining role in
shaping the mode of production (Althusser, 2014). [On top of the mode of
production arises a political and cultural superstructure that works in
dialectical relation/tension with the economic base (mode of
production).]{.underline} Social change occurs do this dialectical
relation with the economic base (Marx, 1979).

[In terms of prospects for social change, Marx is strict about the need
for the productive forces to be developed to create the conditions (i.e.
the material prerequisites) for a post-capitalist world]{.underline}. In
The German Ideology, Marx and Engels (1970: 56, emphasis in original)
state: "[this development of productive forces...is an absolutely
necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made
general]{.underline}, and with destitution the struggle for necessities
and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced."
Without this development, society would be stuck in a condition of
"universal mediocrity" (Marx, 1970: 928). In Capital, this occurs
through the historical process of feudalism → primitive accumulation
(first negation) → capitalism → dictatorship of the proletariat
(negation of the negation) → socialism → communism (classless,
oppressive-less, stateless society) (see Marx, 1990: 92).

However, does every social formation have to undergo the "terrible
frightful vicissitudes" and "harsh tribute" of capitalist development
(Anderson, 2010; Marx, 1881; Shanin, 1983)? In a very interesting and
enlightening correspondence between Marx and Vera Zasulich (a Russian
Menshevik), [Marx]{.underline} clearly says that he [restricted the
"historical inevitability" of the process of primitive accumulation and
the development of capitalist relations of production to the countries
of western Europe]{.underline}. In this correspondence, Marx makes the
argument that the rural commune in Russia, that still existed on a
national scale in the late 1800s, could bypass the horrors of the
historical phase of capitalism by appropriating the positives of the
capitalist mode of production and go directly into "collective
production on a national scale" (Marx, 1881). However, in order for the
Russian rural commune to appropriate the positives of the capitalist
mode of production (i.e. machines and technologies that make life
easier), this would first require the abolishment of capitalist property
relations in the countries where the productive forces are developed.
Capitalist/imperialist countries tend to not just give away technologies
to countries that have antagonistic social systems to the capitalist
mode of production. Therefore, the early Bolsheviks emphasized, over and
over, the utmost need for workers' revolution to occur in Germany as
fundamental for the survival of the new worker's state. Does this not
show the fundamental importance of overthrowing capitalism in the global
north? Not only do the material conditions already exist to have
socialism, but also, a worker's revolution in the global north could
help develop the productive forces of countries in the global south on a
revolutionary socialist basis! Cohen (2000: 389--395) suggests that the
fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991 is bad for
socialist politics but good for the method of historical-materialism.
Cohen suggests that the technological determinist and teleological
version of historical materialism that he advocates for was in fact
strengthened by the fall of the former USSR, because the USSR had a
workers/socialist revolution where the productive forces were not
developed to enough degree to sustain a socialist abundant society.
Thus, his particular historical materialist framework can be applied
today, where most of the world is deploying capitalist methods to
develop the productive forces.

However, as we see with Marx's correspondence with Zasulich, Cohen's
claim is simply Eurocentrism at its core. The traditional teleological
historical-materialist model does not fit neatly with every society,
especially ones outside the confines of western Europe. [What
is]{.underline} perhaps [universal about historical materialism is the
need for developed productive forces for socialism]{.underline}, and
there is more than one way to do this and get to socialism. [The method
of historical-materialism is universal, but not its traditional
European-centered historical model.]{.underline}

In the famous "Preface" to A Contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy, or what Althusser (2014) calls Stalin's Bible, Marx (1970: 21)
says a similar thing, just in a broad fashion:

[No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for
which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations
of production never replace older ones before the material conditions
for their existence have matured within the framework of the old
society]{.underline}. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such
tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show
that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its
solution are already present or at least in the course of formation.

[In the 21st century, we seem to have the means to solve the problem,
but still cannot do it. Why is this?]{.underline} Because the productive
forces are not the determinant factor! In fact, the "productive forces
are nothing at all if they are not rendered operational, and they can
only operation in and under the aegis of their relations of production"
(Althusser, 2014: 21). Thus, [instead of the economistic notion that the
productive forces determine the superstructure, "the relations of
production are determinant, on the basis of the existing productive
forces and within the material limits they set]{.underline}" (Althusser,
2014: 21, emphasis in original). The capitalist relations of production
and their reproduction maintain the capitalist mode of production even
when the productive forces are developed to such a degree that they have
come in conflict with the relations of production. Of course, we have
seen the relations of production change in response to shifts within the
productive forces. [When the shift from Fordist to the neoliberal regime
of accumulation]{.underline} [occurred, the relations and social
relations of production changed in response, but they remained
capitalist relations of production because the changes in the productive
forces were led and guided by capitalist relations]{.underline}. Modes
of production can have wholesale change (e.g. capitalism → socialism) or
changes within the prevalent mode of production itself (e.g.
Fordism/standardized production regimes → Neoliberalism/flexible
production regimes). It is obvious then that [the relations of
production must be revolutionized; working people must seize and take
control of the means of production]{.underline}. Whether there is simply
a change in the prevalent mode of production or a wholesale change in
[the mode production is determined by the degree of class
struggle]{.underline} (i.e. the subjective component).

Revolutionary optimism and hope

[The productive forces necessary for socialism exist in the US and
throughout the global north]{.underline}. [The conditions to eradicate
poverty, homelessness, create non-ablest spaces, and so on
exist.]{.underline} [It just takes the political will to make this
material reality free from its capitalist confines]{.underline}. [For
working-class activists living in the global north, this needs to be
emphasized ad nauseum.]{.underline} As Marx says, the bourgeoisie create
their own "gravediggers": "the advance of industry ... replaces the
isolation of the workers...with their revolutionary combination, due to
association (Marx, 1970: 930 FN). However, and most unfortunately, the
simple centralization of workers in one place (like a city or a factory)
does not automatically produce revolutionary consciousness amongst the
workers themselves. Capitalism and all of its vulgarities still persist;
[something is blocking the transition]{.underline}. Many point to things
such as [ideology, bourgeois cultural hegemony, "false consciousness,"
"desire," and "mystification" as reasons for the nonexistence of a
working-class revolution in the US.]{.underline} The argument goes: the
reason feudalism could be transcended was because in feudalism the
division between the time when serfs/peasants were working for their own
subsistence and directly for the lords was clear as noonday. Feudal
exploitation was achieved through "extra-economic" means as Wood (2017)
says. In capitalism, "surplus labour and necessary labour are mingled
together" (Marx, 1970: 346). ["Mystification" is built into the
wage-relation itself]{.underline} (see Burawoy, 2012). There is some
deal of truth that [workers in capitalism can fall for
imperialist-capitalist ideology, but]{.underline} I argue that [there
are actual real material and structural reasons for the nonexistence of
working-class revolutions in the US and global north more
broadly]{.underline}.

If one actually talks to [working people]{.underline}, a lot of them
know that things in their world are messed up and don't necessarily buy
into capitalist ideology. Though many do not have revolutionary
consciousness yet, they are not simply tricked by imperialist-capitalist
ideology. "[The everyday" for US workers is in the workplace. Many work
multiple jobs just to scrape by. Working people just want to come home
from work and enjoy the little free time they have]{.underline}, or they
are simply working so much that it is almost impossible to have
revolutionary consciousness, or if they do [they cannot act upon it
because they are just trying to survive]{.underline}, and thus doubt
better days are ahead. [But, these conditions can be
overcome]{.underline}.

Truly revolutionary working-class ideas do not arise spontaneously
within the working class itself. [Marxism]{.underline} has to be learned
by the working masses, and it [is]{.underline} indeed [a science that
working and oppressed people can learn; it just has to be
introduced.]{.underline} It must be introduced [by a revolutionary
vanguard party composed of the most advanced and class-conscious working
people]{.underline}. [Vanguard parties provide]{.underline} the
[material and infrastructural foundation for working-class people to
join the ranks of the revolutionaries]{.underline} (see Dean, 2016).
Workers must be able to understand and explain the class character of
all political phenomenon---Marxism provides this. In "What Is to Be
Done?" Lenin says that a class-conscious worker cannot be left to work
11 hours a day in a factory if we want the worker to develop clear
revolutionary class consciousness. Thus, as he says, [the party must
make the arrangements necessary to ensure that the worker can
have]{.underline} more [free time for organizing and developing
revolutionary class consciousness. The vanguard party form makes joining
the revolution truly accessible to the vast masses of
people]{.underline}. To paraphrase Lenin (1987 \[1929\]), the working
class left to organize themselves will fall into trade unionism, which
is ingrained in bourgeois ideology and thus cannot transcend the
capitalist mode of production. A Marxist (i.e. historical materialist)
understanding of society can indeed be understood by the masses of
people, which will in turn unleash the power of class consciousness
itself as a real material power.

The way Marx explains how [the capitalist mode of production develops
through time empowers workers and provides revolutionary
optimism/hope]{.underline}. [As the productive forces develop, more and
more proletarians are produced and less and less capitalists
exist]{.underline} ([due to competition and monopolization,]{.underline}
etc.). Out of market competition, "\[o\]ne capitalist always strikes
down many others" (Marx, 1970: 929). The means of labor are transformed
into forms "that can only be used in common." Thus, as the capitalist
mode of production develops,

The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production ...
The centralization of the means of production and the socialization of
labour reach a point at which they become incompatible with their
capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of
capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.
(Marx, 1970: 929)

[The "immanent laws of capitalist production]{.underline}" itself [leads
to]{.underline} [not only class struggle but also to communist
revolution]{.underline}. The laws of competition within the capitalist
mode of production have the tendency to constantly revolutionize/develop
the productive forces even in the era of monopoly capitalism. The
developed [productive forces]{.underline} that are [created in
capitalism create the foundations from which socialist society can
arise]{.underline} (see Phillips and Rozworski, 2019).

In Capital, Marx says [it will be easier to move beyond capitalism than
it was to move beyond feudalism]{.underline}, for the simple fact that
[during the transition from feudalism to capitalism "it was a matter of
the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few
usurpers]{.underline}." But [in the case of transitioning out of
capitalism, "we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of
the people]{.underline}\[!\]" (Marx, 1970: 929--930). Thus, [to end
capitalist private ownership of the means of production, we only have to
usurp a handful of capitalists]{.underline}, which [numerically
speaking]{.underline} should be [easier to do than usurping millions of
people as what occurred within the process of primitive
accumulation]{.underline} that created the social conditions necessary
for the capitalist mode of production.

[The inert power working people have exists at all times]{.underline}
([even in eras of global working-class defeat and retreat)]{.underline};
[workers can]{.underline} simply [shut production by
striking]{.underline}, [occupying the workplace]{.underline}, and so on
(see Allen and Mitchell, 2003; Glassman, 2003). A nice made-up scenario
I like to give students is that [no one would really notice if all the
bosses/CEOs did not show up to work for one day, but if all workers did
not show up for one day, all of society would simply shut down and reach
a standstill]{.underline}. Additionally, and most importantly, [the
proletariat can use its class power to overthrow and transcend the
bourgeois order by seizing political power]{.underline}---that is, [the
state---and radically transform it to serve the class interests of the
working class. This cannot be dismissed as utopian]{.underline}. [It has
been done in history and it will occur again]{.underline}. This
[revolutionary takeover allows for the working class to make "despotic
inroads on the rights of \[bourgeois\] property, and on the conditions
of bourgeois production"]{.underline} (Marx and Engels, 1978: 490; see
also Lenin, 1987 \[1932\]: 336).

Fascism has been variously defined as an ideology, a doctrine, a

social-psychological and political elements (cf. [Palheta,

catastrophic extreme weather events are already becoming commonplace as
we barrel towards the climatic point of no return. Yet, as critics have
painstakingly argued, capitalism stands as the most intractable obstacle
in the way of the changes that could avert climatic and ecological
devastation ([Camfield,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr21-08969205231195229);

'States of Exception' and the Denigration of Formal Democracy In the
face of such stark challenges, rather than initiating a transition,
crisis has become a hyper-normalised, semi-permanent condition that has
fostered 'states of exception', whose political powers and ideological
tropes are ever-more necessary for the governing classes -- given their
inability to manage not only economic events but also the underlying
ecological-social crisis and its symptoms of morbid decay ([Davidson,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr31-08969205231195229);

Significantly, these 'exceptional states' do not arise as exogenous or
abnormal distortions of the state, but rather as incubated expressions
of it in times of crisis. That is, they are extensions of the
(neo)liberal capitalist state, not its capture or negation -- despite
the widespread antisystemic rhetoric. The rise of these 'states of
exception' is symptomatic of the hollowing out of formal 'neoliberal
democracy', itself an indirect consequence of 'restructured' economies
and polities, together with widespread popular alienation from the
political system and institutions of representation. This highly
circumscribed and increasingly atrophied ('de-democratised') formal
model of capitalist democracy comprised the hegemonic political form of
neoliberalism over multiple decades. However, faced with the manifold
crises of neoliberal accumulation and sociality, this political mode has
become increasingly unable to contain or withstand extant crises or to
offer more than a semblance of legitimacy to the system ([Ayers and
Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229);

A formal or procedural model of capitalist (bourgeois) democracy should
not be viewed therefore as the 'normal' political form of modern
capitalism. Such a model constitutes the 'best political shell for
capitalism' ([Lenin,
1917](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr62-08969205231195229)),
but only in times of relatively stable accumulation. [In times of
crisis]{.underline}, or when the established order is threatened,
[non-democratic modes of power increasingly come to the
fore]{.underline}: \[O\]nce the system begins to disintegrate . . .
[\[the bourgeois\] commitment to democracy . . . emerges to be not
axiomatic and eternal, but pragmatic and ephemeral]{.underline}. [Since
it is the economic system itself which is now at stake, all political
measures needed to save it, including dictatorship, become
legitimate]{.underline} ([Knei-Paz,
1978](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr57-08969205231195229):
355). [Rather than the commonplace juxtaposition of authoritarian-right
regimes to (neo)liberal formal democratic systems, both models
constitute distinct political forms for the management of capitalist
society in different historical conditions]{.underline}. Understood in
this context, [fascism does not constitute 'in itself an "abnormal" or
"rendered abnormal" form of bourgeois rule' but rather 'one of the
necessary forms of bourgeois rule' in particular historical
conjunctures]{.underline} ([Althusser,
1975](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr4-08969205231195229)).
Accordingly, fascism is on the agenda if/when 'the political crisis
reaches such a level of intensity that is becomes insurmountable within
the framework of established forms of political domination' ([Palheta,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr85-08969205231195229)).
That is, when the governing classes are unable to ensure the stability
of the social and political order through the mechanisms of formal
'neoliberal democracy' and routine electoral and political processes.
The fascist option for managing capitalist societies in crisis is by
definition, therefore, based on the categorical rejection of democracy
([Amin,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr6-08969205231195229)).
Hence, the era has witnessed the sustained and widespread assault on
formal democratic values, practices, institutions and imaginaries,
including the pervasive undermining of checks and balances on the
executive branch of the state, particularly by the judiciary and the
press, as well as on dissent per se ([Ayers and Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229)).
In this sense, the threat exists within not only against formal
(neo)liberal democracies ([Adorno,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr1-08969205231195229);

Related to this has been the sustained assault on notions of truth and
reason. In echoes of Hannah Arendt, critics have highlighted the
widespread appropriation of 'truth' in the service of power, with the
pervasive peddling of falsehoods and lies and the increasing
'tribalisation' of information ([Oborne,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr81-08969205231195229);

'Post-truth' politics is ever more taken in through hearsay, social
media targeting and an oligarchical corporate media. These developments
are crucial in the rise of neofascism. As [Paxton
(1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr91-08969205231195229):
6) has argued: 'Feelings propel fascism more than thought does', with
'mobilising passions' functioning to recruit and bind followers to
(neo)fascist leaders. Thought and reason are thereby subordinated to the
prowess and historic destiny of the group, whether nation, race, or
community. Meanwhile, the neoliberal evacuation of the political sphere
has rendered labour and its' supporting organisations increasingly
unable to resist this assault on formal democratic practices,
institutions and values. Indeed, traditional parties and organisations
have been increasingly eschewed as avenues for effective dissent. With
the social infrastructure of working class life and organisation
crushed, avenues for reliable and trustworthy political education are
thereby forfeit. It is in this context that the crises in neoliberalism
have fostered the personalisation of politics and the emergence of
'spectacular' leaders untethered by stabilising institutions such as
party structures, constitutional checks and balances, trade unions,
social movements and the law. Through demagoguery and the blatant
peddling of falsehoods, they cultivate a politics of resentment that
'mobilises passions', but have neither the tools nor the intention of
addressing the causes of widespread dissatisfaction and despair.
Although these leaders often campaign against specific facets or
consequences of neoliberalism, in power they invariably implement
policies intensifying neoliberalism and financialisation, while
attacking all forms of opposition ([Ayers and Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229);

2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr89-08969205231195229)).
The case of Brazil is illustrative here, with the neoliberal capitalist
model experiencing a period of severe political instability. As Armando
Boito has detailed, the weakening of formal (neo)liberal democratic
values and institutions were clearly evident during the crisis that
culminated in the 2016 judicial-parliamentary-media coup ('coup by
impeachment') against President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party
(PT). Crucial to this were increasingly egregious interventions by the
military and judiciary within the national political process. The
administration of Rousseff's successor, former Vice-President Michel
Temer, was unable to secure political stability. This was the
conjuncture in which the neofascist movement in support of Jair
Bolsonaro materialised, as it became clear that none of the orthodoxly
neoliberal parties could gain power in the forthcoming elections.
'Bolsonarism' constituted an 'alliance between neoliberalism and
neo-fascism', underpinned by imperialist capital, the big bourgeoisie
aligned with foreign capital, and the upper middle class: 'an alliance
that neoliberal forces were forced to resort to because of the weakness,
fragmentation, and decline of their traditional political parties'
([Boito,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr14-08969205231195229):
226). Impasse/Stasis and the Crisis of Alternatives Integral to this
process of neofascisation is a sense of stasis or impasse, in which
there exists a collectively experienced imperative to 'break out' of a
crisis, but which the existing formally democratic bourgeois political
formations are immanently incapable of effecting (see also [Polanyi,
2002](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr94-08969205231195229)).
However, also crucial, is that the left is not in a position to seize
the initiative and mobilise around an alternative agenda for social
transformation ([Patnaik,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr89-08969205231195229)).
This remains a contentious issue. Yet, as Ugo Palheta has argued,
fascism is not just the bourgeois rejoinder to an imminent revolutionary
threat, but also the manifestation of a crisis of alternative to the
existing order and the defeat of counter-hegemonic forces. Of course,
(neo)fascists incite fear (real and/or contrived) of the left and
progressive social movements. Donald Trump's fulminations against
'Marxists', antifa, Black Lives Matter, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, queer, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA) + people, the climate
movement, and so on, are illustrative here. But, it is in the inability
of the exploited and oppressed to constitute themselves as revolutionary
political subjects and engage in an experiment of social transformation
(however limited), that allows the far Right to appear as a political
alternative and win the adhesion of very diverse social groups
([Palheta,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr85-08969205231195229)).
In this regard, the advent of 'social neoliberalism' and the illusory
'third way', propounded by erstwhile left and working-class parties, is
implicated in the rise and increased sway of authoritarian-right and
neofascist movements and regimes. With the shift from vanguard to social
neoliberalism, social-democratic parties across the West, as well as
developmental states in the 'Global South', effectively embraced
neoliberalism. Diverse factors and class forces prevailed within
different national contexts, resulting in differing trajectories
according to historical phases, local circumstances, social forces and
relations, state power, and so on. Nonetheless, largely across-the-board
capitulation constituted the 'final stage in the normalization of
neoliberalism' ([Davidson,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr31-08969205231195229):
622). The virtual disappearance of an oppositional left, rooted in the
working-class and resolved to mobilise for meaningful structural change,
has unanchored political systems. Eroded, truncated and deprived of
substance, political systems have lurched ever rightwards. Henceforth,
as political parties converged around neoliberal policies, the political
process was reduced to periodic calls to the ballot box to select
between variations of neoliberalism. The net result was an increased
alienation from politics and the formal democratic process, as
disempowerment morphed into disenfranchisement, fuelling a crisis of
representation. Meanwhile, with socialist forces largely in disarray and
unable to intervene effectively in terms of an alternative to the
existing order, crisis has redounded instead to the advantage of the
hard-right. The extreme-centre, it turns out, became the harbinger of
the extreme-right: After decades in which nominal working-class parties
clearly represented capital more effectively than labor, workers around
the globe have turned to nationalist populists. For all their
proto-fascist tendencies, at least these leaders are able to
successfully appeal to working-class interests, even if only in rhetoric
([Levenson,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr63-08969205231195229)).
The Class Basis of Coming to Power This highlights a key aspect of
neofascisation. While the rise of fascism as a strategy for political
power is associated with a systemic crisis of capitalism, it does not
constitute simply a rapidly assembled political artifice of the
governing classes, primed to mete out force as necessary. It is that too
(see below), but also encompasses the social alliances forged to
facilitate an expansion of the popular base of fascist movements and
regimes, at least in the initial stages ([Paxton,
1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr91-08969205231195229)).
That is, under the above historical conditions, significant sections of
the population, particularly those from the amorphous 'middle-class' or
'petit-bourgeoisie' but also, in some circumstances, segments of the
working-class, rally to fascism as a so-called mass movement ([Knei-Paz,
1978](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr57-08969205231195229);

Such alliances are highly problematic. Once in power, fascist regimes
have historically purged themselves of the more radical elements and
lower orders that aided their rise to power, rapidly allying themselves
with big business ([Foster,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr42-08969205231195229);

Indeed, as Ishay [Landa
(2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr60-08969205231195229)
has compellingly argued, the commonplace association of fascism with
'the masses' is deeply problematic. Rather, inter-war fascism
constituted the culmination of efforts by the upper-class elites and
their middle-class allies to subdue mass politics and its broader
social, cultural and economic implications. This pattern manifested
promptly with the Trump administration, for example ([Pierson,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr93-08969205231195229)).
Although somewhat erratic and conflict-ridden, the Trump administration
functioned in the interests of capital (in general), with the 'big
bourgeoisie' (now mainly finance capital) the principal beneficiaries in
terms of tax cuts, buttressing the hegemony of Wall Street, regulatory
rollbacks, appointments to the federal judiciary from district courts to
the Supreme Court, and so
on.[5](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#fn5-08969205231195229)
This benefitted not only long-standing sites of economic power, from
defence contractors, the energy industry, and Big Pharma, to more
peripheral donor coalitions of 'lumpen-capitalists' or 'post-industrial
hinterland robber barons' whose profits derive from real estate, private
equity, casinos, and services extending from private armies to payday
loan usury ([Barrow,
2020b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr12-08969205231195229);

Meanwhile, the 'foundational plank of Trumpism' -- namely the rhetoric
of reviving the Rust Belt and kick-starting an economy decimated by
decades of neoliberal globalisation and the deindustrialisation it
engendered -- was 'a decided bust' ([Palmer,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr86-08969205231195229);

Such problematic social alliances notwithstanding, it remains crucial to
understand the social composition of contemporary movements and regimes.
In the United States, for example, critics have challenged the
mainstream narrative which averred that Trump rode a wave of 'white
working-class' disillusionment and resentment, mobilising non-voters as
well as alienated blue-collar Republicans and Democrats. More
accurately, the overall picture in the key battlegrounds in the Midwest
and Southern states was of a decline in working-class turnout and
collapse in votes for the Democratic Party among many of its core
constituencies. By contrast, the amorphous 'middle-class' constituted
the primary electoral base for Trump ([Davis,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr33-08969205231195229);
[Moody,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr76-08969205231195229)),
as well as being over-represented in the storming of the Capitol in
January 2021 ([Watters,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr126-08969205231195229)).[7](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#fn7-08969205231195229)
Nonetheless, sections of the working class in the United States did
support Trump in 2016 and 2020. Such support cannot be dismissed simply
as petit-bourgeois reaction. Accordingly, there is a 'popular' or 'mass'
element within such politics, at least in the initial
stages.[8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#fn8-08969205231195229)
In the United States, for example, both major political parties have
been neoliberal. Trump seemed to offer something different to strata of
workers desperate to regain their former position ([Foster,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr42-08969205231195229);

But understanding such positions requires inter alia consideration of
subjective dimensions of the current historical conjuncture. That is,
[the existential, affective and psychological dimensions of crisis,
particularly the issue of insecurity, that has rendered some sections of
the working class, at least in the initial stages, vulnerable to 'the
siren song of fascism']{.underline} ([Gandesha,
2020b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr45-08969205231195229):
7). Neoliberalism, Inequality, Insecurity [Neoliberalism's regime of
power and form of social existence have been characterised by turmoil,
insecurity and devastation. The 2008/09 crisis and decade-plus of
austerity have accelerated such processes, as economic stagnation, the
rising cost of living, cuts to social security and public services,
falling wages/incomes, and rising under- and unemployment have combined
to create hugely increasing inequality.]{.underline} As the World
Inequality Report details, since the 1980s, the top 1% earners have
captured twice as much growth in global income as the 50% poorest
individuals ([Alvaredo, et al.,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr5-08969205231195229)).
[In the United States alone, neoliberalism has devastated the working
class with upwards redistribution of income calculated at over US\$47
trillion from 1975 to 2018]{.underline} ([Price and Edwards,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr98-08969205231195229)).
Significantly, [the global 'middle class', including across Europe and
North America, has also been increasingly unmoored through such
processes. Indebted, impoverished, anxious and vulnerable, the vestiges
of this 'privileged' social strata lament their declining protections,
benefits and security, as well as diminishing opportunities for
intergenerational social mobility]{.underline} ([Ayers and Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229);

[The impact of neoliberal economic restructuring on labour, employment,
social reproduction and community life has been central to such
processes, with neoliberalism encompassing the structural as well as
'organisational' disciplining of labour]{.underline} ([Clua-Losada and
Ribera-Almandoz,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr26-08969205231195229)).
[Millions of formal sector jobs have been eliminated or offshored,
public sector employment opportunities have declined as a result of
privatisation and 'retrenchment', and job stability, pay and conditions
have deteriorated]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the gig-economy, zero-hour
contracts, temporary and part-time employment have increased. In
general, workers have tended to become increasingly divided,
disorganised, disempowered and 'deskilled', falling ever further behind
capital in political influence as well as wage-share ([Boffo et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr13-08969205231195229)).
[Increasing economic hardship, together with the widening gap within and
across states, has resulted in a growing awareness that neoliberal
globalisation has not worked for everyone, engendering an increasingly
polarised politics and the rapid growth of right-wing political
movements.]{.underline} For the most part, liberals as well as some
sections of social democracy have failed to adequately comprehend the
long journey of many from the increasingly disenfranchised, alienated,
and insecure working-classes and middle strata into the hard-right fold.
All too often 'progressive' explanations have presumed and reproached
such supporters for a putative cognitive impairment, moral failure or
both. Largely absent from this 'progressive' worldview is an
understanding that such individuals and communities are attempting to
respond, at least in part, to their experience of the long global
economic downturn and its manifold social-ecological crises ([Ayers and
Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229)).
The hard-right, in its myriad forms, has been adept at tapping into
these sources of increasing mass discontent. [Key to the hard-right's
appeal is the possibility that it may avert or reverse downwards
mobility and social destabilisation; that is, restore some sense of
stability and security]{.underline} ([Robinson,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr105-08969205231195229)).
As such, [the social disorientation associated with long-term economic
decimation, social fragmentation, and the devastation of erstwhile
values, ways of life and forms of belonging, has created a fertile
ground for the rise of all kinds of zealous self-assertions]{.underline}
([Vanaik,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr123-08969205231195229))
-- [whether national, 'racial', ethnic, religious, misogynist and/or
heterosexist.]{.underline} Indeed, routinely inflected by toxic
masculinity, misogyny and homophobia, the era has [witnessed the rise of
increasingly influential antigender and
anti-LGBTQIA + mobilisations]{.underline}, for example, in Poland,
Hungary, the United States, Russia, Turkey and Brazil. Such processes
are widely framed in terms of the notion of a so-called backlash
([Faludi,
2006](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr39-08969205231195229))
to collective mobilisations -- which inevitably provoke a reaction in
terms of racist, hyper-masculinist and patriarchal radicalisations. The
latter take various forms and trajectories, including 'female
antifeminism' and sexual politics as a 'primary vector of fascisation'
([Marasco,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr73-08969205231195229)),
ultimately realising their full political coherence in the neofascist
project ([Majewska,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr70-08969205231195229);

Yet, [understanding the scale and intensity of such opposition to
racial, gender and sexual equality is not only about a 'backlash' but is
also to be understood in the context of neoliberalism]{.underline}
([Graff and Korolczuk,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr48-08969205231195229)).
The rise of aggressive self-assertions, whether framed in (overlapping)
terms of national, racial, ethnic, religious, gender or sexual identity,
can function as a form of consolation, the affirmations of which provide
a balm for social despair. Indeed, [in times of crisis, when the present
is experienced as unsatisfactory, and the future looks increasingly
bleak, it is the 'unchangeable' past, albeit an idealised and mythical
past, that appears to provide a sense of security and
stability]{.underline} ([Vanaik,
2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr123-08969205231195229)).
Accordingly, [for some, appeals to 'blood', 'nation', 'fatherland',
'family values' or 'tradition' may appear as the only feasible form of
collectivity still available]{.underline} -- particularly in a putative
context of TINA where any systemic alternative to capitalism had
ostensibly collapsed in 1989--91 ([Davidson and Saull,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr32-08969205231195229)).
Imperialism, Nation, and 'Race' [A key factor in such political
upheavals is modern capitalist imperialism and its attendant ideologies
of nation and 'race'.]{.underline} At least prior to the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, the relationship between neofascism and the
specific character of imperialism, as a geopolitical force and as a
metapolitics, had been curiously absent within much of the debate on new
fascisms -- despite the crucial nature of the relationship in
20th-century fascism ([Walker,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr125-08969205231195229)).
Indeed, Nico [Poulantzas
(1974)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr97-08969205231195229)
modified the well-known dictum on capitalism and fascism to read that
'[it is \[s/he\] who does not wish to discuss imperialism who should
stay silent on the subject of fascism']{.underline} (p. 17). [Modern
imperialism is motivated fundamentally by the dynamics of capital
accumulation]{.underline}. [Multiple capitals seek their self-expansion
in competition with other capitals, including through imperialist
finance, investment, production and trade in the 'Global
South]{.underline}'. [Such state strategies mobilise countertendencies
to generalised crises of profitability, notably during times of systemic
crisis, thereby generating the conditions for increased
political-military rivalry between imperialist powers]{.underline}
([Patnaik and Patnaik,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr90-08969205231195229);

However, it is possible for more than one 'variant of imperialism' to
simultaneously coexist, albeit on different scales. [What pertains today
are both an 'ultra-imperialism']{.underline}, [in which a dominant
coalition of relatively autonomous imperialist states act to maintain
the unity of the capitalist system despite other antagonisms between
them]{.underline} (evidenced in the ultra-imperialism which spans the
north Atlantic, unifying North America and Europe as two potentially
rival 'blocs' within a common political and economic coalition). [But
also pertaining is an 'imperial rivalry' between this combined
transatlantic bloc and China, Russia, and allies]{.underline}. Hence, we
have both ultra-imperialism in the broad sense and rivalry between three
imperialist forces: North America-Europe, Russia and China ([Banaji,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr8-08969205231195229),
based on [Rowthorn,
1971](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr110-08969205231195229)).[^9^](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#fn9-08969205231195229)
Global capitalism in the earlier decades of the neoliberal era,
particularly following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, witnessed the
predominance of ultra-imperialism. The crisis of capitalist
overaccumulation in the 1970s gave rise to expansion into non-capitalist
or undercapitalised social relations, including internationally, as
North American and European as well as Japanese capitals invested
heavily overseas. Hence a key underpinning of the ultra-imperial model
today has been the internationalisation of capital, with the intensified
integration of the global economy, and the increased interpenetration
and collaboration between national capitals -- notwithstanding complex
stratification within the 'imperialist chain' ([Gordon and Webber,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr47-08969205231195229)).
This variant of imperialism continues to characterise most capital
accumulation internationally ([Banaji,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr8-08969205231195229)).
Yet, [the era since the Great Recession, in particular, has also
witnessed accelerating militarism worldwide and the spectre of
intensifying inter-imperialist rivalries, particularly between North
America-Europe, China and Russia. In the case of the latter, tensions
between the transatlantics and Russia is rooted in a resurgence of
West--East rivalry. Thus, the war in Ukraine is]{.underline} not only
one of national self-determination by Ukraine against Russia, but also,
and increasingly, [an imperialist proxy war by NATO against
Russia]{.underline} ([Unkovski-Korica,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr121-08969205231195229)).
Meanwhile, to-date, [the rivalry with China has been heavily economic,
with intensifying rivalry not due to profound ideological differences
but rather increasing competition between Chinese and US capital
worldwide, since China began aggressively exporting its overaccumulated
capital to the rest of the world in the wake of the Great
Recession]{.underline} (Ho-Fung [Hung,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr52-08969205231195229)).
At one level, [such intensifying rivalry mirrors the dynamics of
inter-capitalist competition in the early 20th century -- which saw the
rise of fascist forces across Europe and beyond and culminated in two
world wars]{.underline}. Yet the internationalisation of capital in the
neoliberal era and the interpenetration of US and Chinese capital, in
particular, renders 21st-century imperialism a complex, competitive but
asymmetric global system which cannot be reduced to the
inter-imperialist rivalry between nation-states in the manner of the
early 20th century ([Robinson,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr105-08969205231195229);

Nonetheless, this does not hinder the appeal, to many, of an imperialist
worldview concomitant with the rise of its attendant ideologies of
ultra-nationalism, racism and xenophobia. [Classical imperialism was
justified by recourse to forms of ultra-nationalism and Europe's
'civilising mission'. Class was thereby displaced by national
identities, enabling the bourgeoisie to garner the support of the lower
petit-bourgeoisie and other classes whose social precarity rendered them
especially insecure and susceptible to xenophobia and extreme forms of
nationalism in the context of an imperialist project]{.underline}
([Gandesha,
2020a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr44-08969205231195229)).
Likewise, in our time, the potential for global working-class
solidarities is further undermined by increasing political and economic
nationalism, accompanied by nationalist fervour and rising xenophobia,
manifest, for example, in the 'America First' agenda and the US--China
trade war, as well as increasingly evident in the US/NATO conflict with
Russia over Ukraine ([Boylan et al.,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr16-08969205231195229)).
However, the ultra-imperialist neoliberal globalisation of production,
global division of labour and global labour arbitrage had itself further
entrenched structural divisions in the global working-class through
inter alia international outsourcing, immigration and temporary work
visas. Accordingly, in addition to hyper-exploitation in the Global
South ([Smith,
2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr113-08969205231195229)),
migrants have been permitted, under highly circumscribed terms and
conditions, to enter labour markets within advanced capitalist
economies, opening-up labour markets to competitive pressures on wages
and increased levels of exploitation. This has fuelled the perception,
and arguably at times the reality, of greater competition from migrant
labour for work within increasingly insecure and precarious
working-class locales ([Parekh et al.,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr87-08969205231195229);

While immigration is not a key driver of low pay, 'blaming migrants' has
become politically expedient in diverting attention from the real causes
of low pay. Such increasingly racialised processes have fuelled a
so-called crisis of white identity in conjunction with the destruction
of structures and institutions of social solidarity rooted in class
([Davidson and Saull,

tropes on the neocolonial imaginary -- cognisant that imperialism
generates 'a kind of cultural boomerang effect' with colonial
technologies and apparatuses (re)constituting the metropolitan political
condition, incubating processes of racialisation]{.underline} ([Walker,

Pro-fascist theorist Carl Schmitt emphasised the articulation of
imperialism with fascism. And [a clear historical trajectory can be
identified from formal imperialism and formal fascism to the neofascism
of our time -- the essence of which is the internal application of
previously external modes of governance, with techniques of division,
including technologies and apparatuses of racialisation, transferred
from the 'macro-level of states and territories, to the micro-level of
bodies]{.underline}, categories of citizenship, the policing of
language, physiognomy, and markers of difference' ([Walker,

Significantly, the authoritarian-right have been able increasingly to
recast the ontological insecurity of neoliberalism within this
imperialist worldview, propounding an ultra-nationalist, xenophobic and
more-or-less explicit racist politics that obscures the class dynamics
of neoliberalism. Under increasing pressure, the centre-right and the
centre-left have often also adopted such racially coded themes,
including 'getting tough' on immigration, crime and welfare dependence
-- in addition to collaborating in the rollback of the non-market
protections secured by the workers in the previous phases of capitalism
([Ayers and Saad-Filho,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr7-08969205231195229)).
[The spectre of neofascism does not result directly or necessarily,
therefore, from economic insecurity or loss of status, per se, but
rather is actively produced and indeed 'normalised' or 'banalised'
across much of the political spectrum through the translation of
economic insecurities into cultural anxieties]{.underline} ([Gandesha,
2020b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr45-08969205231195229)).
Such political processes are integral to the rise of states of exception
and the Schmittian concern with the political characterised by the
'friend/enemy' relation ([Johal,

[This worldview leads to the dehumanisation and targeting of specific
groups with the 'enemy' construed either as 'external', such as
migrants, asylum seekers, radical Islam, China, Russia, the European
Union, or 'internal', in the case of ethnic minorities, immigrants,
'antifa' and the Black Lives Matter movement in the United

'The One True Fascist God, the Market' This relation bears emphasising.
The existential, affective and psychological dimensions of crisis that
underpin adherence to fascist 'solutions', is commonly viewed in terms
of the political domain defined primarily in terms of the nation and
'national identity'. [The overarching narrative is framed primarily in
terms of reversing supposed national decline through national
restoration]{.underline} ([Palheta,

Yet, the simple correspondence between fascism and the nation remains
problematic ([Walker,

[The notion of extreme forms of nationalism]{.underline} as inhering
intrinsically within fascism [is itself largely devoid of meaning
without acknowledging the concrete class composition of such
'nationalism', together with the way that 'national "palingenesis" was
itself predicated on the bedrock of imperialistic-capitalistic
triumph']{.underline} ([Landa,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr59-08969205231195229):

subservient to, ultra Social Darwinism' or the survival-of-the-fittest
matrix: In the fascist axiological hierarchy . . . [the nation comes
only after a fetishized Nature whose graces are conferred upon those who
are successful in the business of imperialism and
capitalism,]{.underline} those 'strongest in courage and industry'

319--320). Rather than based on the mystified theory of origin of the
'imagined community' -- generally the nation -- the ultimate protagonist
of fascism is arguably 'a fantasy of a Law of Nature, a sort of
evolutionary narrative inhabited by "winners" and "losers"', whose
positions are determined by this 'Law of the Strong' -- which is nothing
other than the modern capitalist conception of the market ([Walker,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr125-08969205231195229)).
What preceded Trump in the United States, for example, were not repeated
upsurges in fetishisation of the nation but rather decades of the
neoliberal economisation of all aspects of life and the denigration of
'society'. This depreciation of society is not a direct derivation from
the category of the nation, but rather results from the 'telescoping of
the concept of "the market" into a kind of alternate form of sociality,
in which there are nothing but "winners" and "losers"': In such a
schema, the Lump that we are all becoming can only dream of 'winning',
not of emancipation, not of freedom, but only of a dwarfish and stunted
vision of the classic Spenglerian . . . 'Great Politics' . . . \[And\]
most importantly, for contemporary fascist tendencies, a form of racial
taxonomy as a kind of 'measure', itself a form of 'money' or 'wealth' --
the proof of being a 'winner', and the fear that, since Natural Law
dominates all, we might all become losers ([Walker,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr125-08969205231195229)).
[It was this social imaginary that Trump, for example, inflamed,
allowing US proto-fascists to fantasise of becoming 'winners', of
overcoming all that obstructed 'the sentiment of
accumulation']{.underline}. [In the process, it was not sufficient to
'win'. Rather, the 'losers' had to be 'brought to heel, "civilised" and
adapted to the one true fascist God, the market'.]{.underline} In this,
tellingly, [the centre-right and centre-left shared the same deity as
Trump's foot-soldiers: 'the dollar, the number, the market, the
empire']{.underline} ([Walker,

Such delusions of 'winning' and the spurious political claims which
underpinned them are, at one level, indicative of a collective delusion
and/or hysteria. But, at another level, are signs of a mass of angry,
wretched and downtrodden people, clutching at 'an idea, any idea, any
myth, anything to feel part of a collective experience of politics, of
life' -- after the ravages of neoliberal capitalism and the manifold
destruction and social atomisation it has wrought ([Walker,

Trumpism presented an opportunity for people to view their dreams and

Political Violence, Repression and Coercion Finally, [characteristic of
these emerging 'states of exception' are ever-increasing levels of
political violence, repression, coercion and social control, as these
exceptional states seek to manage the crisis of accumulation and
attendant political, social and environmental conditions -- including
the fear that crisis could lead to uncontrollable revolt]{.underline}.
As such, [a key part of the rising militarism worldwide is the
strengthening of the authoritarian repressive state at
home.]{.underline} Across North America and Europe it is [evident in the
expansion of the prison-industrial-military complexes, pervasive and
paramilitarised policing, technologically advanced surveillance systems
and crowd control techniques, the criminalisation of protest and
dissent, the racialisation of criminality and the repressive policing of
communities of colour]{.underline} and working-class youth, [specious
wars on drugs and 'terrorism', as well as the increased policing of
boundaries and nation through border-keeping, anti-immigrant
legislation, detention centres and deportation regimes]{.underline}

Such murderous state policies include Fortress Europe's policing of the
Mediterranean and eastern European borders, where illegal, systematic
and lethal 'pushbacks' further endanger migrants' lives. State-sponsored
special armed units operating with elite coast guard and police forces
have been documented intercepting, beating and torturing refugees,
unlawfully and violently expelling them from within the EU's external
border. Such actions not only contravene the Geneva Refugee Convention
but also belie the EU's claim to uphold the rule of law, given its
financial and logistical support to border protection and the widespread
legal violations thereof. Members of these shadow units have been
identified on social media displaying right-wing extremist and fascist
symbols ([Christides et al.,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr25-08969205231195229);

Far-right armed vigilantes have also endeavoured to patrol borders, for
example, on the German--Poland border where groups with suspected links
to neo-Nazi groups have blocked migrants crossing. The role of
extra-state violence in the form of broad-based paramilitary
organisations has constituted a key element that distinguished the rise
of fascism from other reactionary movements. For now, most neofascist
movements are not based on mass militias. Moreover, as Palheta
emphasises, extra-state militias remain subordinate to the strategy of
the fascist/neofascist leaderships. The formation of mass militias
depends on historical context and the demands of general strategy in
terms of their ability to deploy, depending on historical circumstance,
both legal and violent tactics. Integral to that consideration, is the
extent to which states in our time wield across-the-board technologies
of surveillance and repression incomparable to that of the inter-war
period. Thus, at present, state violence may for the most part be
sufficient to annihilate any and all forms of opposition -- including
physically, when necessary ([Palheta,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr85-08969205231195229)).
Nonetheless there are multiple and burgeoning cases of violence by armed
militias with links to the state. Vigilante groups allied with the
ruling BJP in India have threatened, harassed, attacked and lynched
minority religious and community members with impunity, including the
Gujarat pogrom and that in Delhi in 2020 following the Citizenship
Amendment Act ([Khan and Chakrabarty,

The neofascist street gangs of Golden Dawn and its offshoots in Greece
have carried out acts of violence and hate crimes against immigrants and
refugees, ethnic minorities, LGBTQIA + individuals and left-wing
political opponents. In Hungary, the violence of far-right militias has
targeted predominantly Roma people, claiming to increase the security of
the 'Hungarian' population vis-à-vis the 'Gypsy crime' problem
([Mireanu,

And in Brazil, violence by Bolsonaro's shock troops, especially during
the 2022 election campaign, resulted in the deaths of Workers Party
activists and the physical assault of hundreds of others ([Purdy,

Meanwhile, the Trump-emboldened Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three
Percenters, the boogaloo movement and other far-right vigilante groups
and armed militias terrorise the streets of US cities such as
Charlottesville, Portland, Kenosha and Salt Lake City, turning these
cities into 'proving grounds' for the far-right, 'priming' vigilantes
for a period of political violence ([Evans,

Conclusion: Confronting Neofascism These are dangerous times. [Crucial
to any understanding of the insurgence of neofascism is an awareness of
the historical conditions under which fascism comes to the fore -- that
is, in periods of capitalist crisis]{.underline}. [With the systemic
crisis of capitalism set to worsen, the threat and reality of resorting
to neofascist solutions becomes ever greater.]{.underline} However,
insofar as it derives from a crisis of capitalist accumulation and
sociality, including the hardening of social confrontations, the process
of neofascisation is both contradictory and highly unstable: 'There is
by no means a royal road for the fascist movement' ([Palheta,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr85-08969205231195229)).
Indeed, as [Saladdin Ahmed
(2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr2-08969205231195229)
has emphasised, classical fascism never enjoyed a day without
resistance; likewise neofascism. [That the process of fascisation does
not lead necessarily to neofascism ultimately depends on the ability of
the exploited and oppressed to successfully contest the multiple
terrains of political struggle, constituting themselves as autonomous
political subjects to effect a fundamental transformation of our
societies and world.]{.underline} [Such transformation must be congruent
with the ecological conditions of existence on this planet]{.underline}:
'[Whereas past revolutionary struggles have strived for an emancipation
of labor from capital, we are challenged not just to imagine, but to
demand the emancipation of the earth from capital. For the earth to
live, capitalism must die']{.underline} ([Estes,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr37-08969205231195229):
257). Unquestionably, this involves resisting the forces of reaction,
confronting the far- and fascist- right who populate the electoral and
institutional terrain, as well as more broadly in society, the workplace
and on the streets. But [also crucial is that antifascism is conceived
as a necessary complement to related struggles (antiracist,
anti-imperialist, antimilitarism, feminist, ecological, and so on) not
just a struggle, waged independently, against the organised hard-right.
Hence it involves creating a plurality of types of tactics,
organisations and strategies]{.underline} -- [the infrastructures of
dissent -- to fight neofascism on the basis of common action of the
oppressed]{.underline} ([Burley,
2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08969205231195229#bibr19-08969205231195229);

[Ultimately, opposing fascisation and neofascism entails the
transcendence of neoliberal capitalism itself. Overcoming the monster of
neofascism demands that we reject and transcend the capitalist morass
from which it emerges, takes root and spreads. A meaningful alternative
to neoliberal state and capital requires us to look again to
socialism]{.underline} ([Barker et al.,

This presents a major challenge for the radical left today, but
necessarily [involves taking-up the class questions which the far- and
fascist-right seek to exploit but cannot resolve. It necessitates
turning, understanding and building outwards to the mass of the
population, to recohere a mass-based, genuinely anticapitalist, radical
left primed for the transformative struggles of our age.]{.underline}

#### Historical materialism is the only method up to the task of problem-solving modern crises. The Aff is an anti-materialist response that fails to engage the structural conditions of power. Prefer alternatives that adopt a critical, pragmatic engagement with socioeconomic conditions to facilitate change.

Revaluation of Historical Materialism," *Journal for Critical Education

Habermas (1979) posits **[historical materialism]{.underline}** not
simply as a heuristic, but, as aforementioned, a ―theory of social
evolution‖ (130) that [can be used to solve many of the problems
confronting]{.underline} the moral development [of social
life.]{.underline} Progress is, under this historical and materialist
rubric, both social and physical; [it represents advances in ―empirical
knowledge and moral-practical insight . . . the development of
productive forces and the maturity of forms of social
intercourse‖]{.underline} (142).

Habermas (1979), however, warns against a retrogression of Marx's
general theory into ―historical objectivism . . . \[where\]
philosophical questions \[are suppressed\] in favor of a scientistic
understanding‖ (96). Although suspicious of absolute narratives, he also
takes a different stance from some on the postmodern left that the
instability of social norms is necessarily beneficial to the moral
development of a society. In neo-normative tenor he states, ―a
philosophical ethics not restricted to metaethical statements is
possible today only if we can reconstruct general presuppositions of
communication and procedures for justifying norms and values‖ (97).
These presuppositions set the boundaries for social change as the
ability of the populace at large to analyze social circumstances and
learn their intricacies: ―a developmental logic \[that may explain\] the
range of variations within which cultural values, moral representation -
can be changed and can find different historical expression‖ (98). Put
crudely, the social learning a given culture can accommodate, and the
emotional capacity of consciousness to conflict with the underlying
contradictions within a given society, is related to the quality and
quantity of direct systemic social change. This is in many ways akin to
Marx's belief in criticality as a major component in driving alterations
in consciousness and social organization.8 However, Marx's ideals were
fixed toward surpassing the economic relations of capitalist production,
and the necessarily corresponding and symbiotic, if not vaguely
parasitic, sociocultural formations.9 Habermas (1979) retains the
materialist stance that ―culture remains a superstructural phenomenon‖
(98), although he elevates its prominence concerning the way in which it
affects the progressive process, especially in the realm of human
communication. He also recognizes that the superstructure is not
entirely dependent on the base except when ―a society moves into a new
developmental stage‖ (143). As Terry Eagleton (1976) has noted, culture
has free play within capitalist society, and, is not in a ―symmetrical
relationship‖ with the economic base, and therefore will assume many
forms according to ―its own tempo of development, its own internal
evolution‖ (14). It will nonetheless, however, be altered by any
significant change in the modes of production. Dewey (1961), through his
own twist on dialectical analysis, somewhat modifies the relationship as
containing a constantly shifting contextual ground. He states, In its
\[Marxism's\] original formulation, there was an important qualification
which later statements have tended to ignore. For it was admitted that
when political relations, science, etc., are once produced, they operate
as causes of subsequent events, and in this capacity are capable of
modifying in some degree the operation of the forces which originally
produced them. (77) Dewey (1961), like Marx, sees a liberated economic
base as a vehicle to higher aspirations outside of the mean necessities
of life: ―The ultimate place of economic organization in human life is
to assure the secure basis for an ordered expression of individual
capacity and for the satisfaction of the needs of man \[sic\] in
non-economic directions‖ (88).

For Habermas (1979), [alteration of the base generally causes a crisis
when the "dominant forms of social integration"]{.underline} (144)
[cannot be reconciled with the problems that challenge aspects of the
society's cultural identity formation.]{.underline} Accordingly,
[critical knowledge of productive structures represents "cognitive
potential that can be used for solving **crisis-inducing system
problems**"]{.underline} (147), providing such an aptitude exists among,
and congruent pedagogies for, the denizens of a given system. He states,

The endogenous growth of knowledge is thus a necessary condition of
social evolution (147), \[and\] [the evolutionary learning process of
societies is dependent on the competencies of the individuals that
belong to them.]{.underline} The latter in turn acquire their
competencies not as isolated monads but by growing into the symbolic
structures of their life-worlds. (154)

The given complexity of the extant symbolic structure provides a
foundation on which critical discursive examination and action can lend
itself to efforts toward social evolution. An example of this symbolic
life world in contemporary U.S. society could be extant, although not
realized, ideas concerning democracy or simply economic fairness.

Dewey (1963) also brings connection between those extant social
conditions and the ability to act toward social change. Moral concepts,
plentiful in most cultures, must have systems that support them, or else
become impotent, innocuous, and intangible. [**Shifts in consciousness
are not at root an individualistic affair, or one fostered by fiat, but
must be supported in conversation with societal circumstances and mores
as they are acted and experienced in life**.]{.underline} He states,

The idea that disposition and attitudes can be altered by merely 'moral'
means conceived of as something that goes on wholly inside the person is
itself one of the old patterns that has to be changed. Thought, desire
and purpose exist in a constant give and take of interaction with
environing conditions. (62)

Pursuant, Habermas (1979) uses developmental psychology to trace the
moral evolution of society, within the context of ―linguistically
established intersubjectivity‖ (99), among personal and group identities
and world views, as it pertains to theories that hitherto have been used
to gauge ontogenetic development. As with Marx, [our subjective selves
emerge in an objective world that becomes so through our perception and
conception.]{.underline}10 [Its manipulability is
regulated]{.underline}, however, [by the social norms that dictate the
parameters of intersubjective language rules that assist us in identity
and consciousness formation, interpretation, and communicative
understanding.]{.underline} Roughly following the cognitive
developmental stages of Jean Piaget, Habermas (1979) ends with a final
and most mature stage termed ―the universalistic stages of development‖
(100). This is where the internal self, or ego, ventures out into the
world and finds itself reflected in the discourses we conduct with other
knowing subjects. Individuals at this stage have the ability to question
the validity of norms, and

transcend the objectivism of a given nature and, in the light of
hypotheses explain the given from contingent boundary conditions\[,\] .
. . can burst the sociocentrism of a traditional order and, in the light
of principles, understand (and if necessary criticize) existing norms as
mere conventions. . . . \[T\]he dogmatism of the given and existing is
broken, the prescientifically constituted object domains can be
relativized in relation to the system of ego-demarcations so that
theories can be traced back to the cognitive accomplishments of
investigating subjects and norm systems to the will-formation of
subjects living together. (102)

Therefore, [the individual can begin the process of reconstructing the
world through critically engaging the origins of present norms and
applying them to the pursuit of perceivable and desirable oughts. This
cognitive stage]{.underline}, in its societal incarnation, [represents a
body politic that is able to facilitate social change based on a more
developed moral consciousness concerning the leveling of economic power
to produce our social life more freely.]{.underline} 11

This pursuit of purposeful oughts finds parallel in Dewey's (1963)
notion of moral development being inextricably embedded in the flux of
social interactions. ―Flux does not have to be created,‖ Dewey writes,
―but it does have to be directed. It has to be so controlled that it
will move to some end in accordance with the principles of life, since
life itself is development‖ (56).

Central to social evolution is how personal identity formation takes
place through ―repeated actualized self-identifications . . . in the
intersubjective relations of its social life world‖ (Habermas 1979,
106). Habermas astutely points out that identities are not created sui
genesis, and that ego formations are always the product of reciprocal
(not equal) communicative actions between the self and others. These
exchanges thus represent ―intersubjectively recognized
self-identification‖ (107). Consensus, or at least resignation,
concerning identity on the part of the individual ego is determined in
large part by others in society agreeing upon the given selfdefinition
of the individual within the web of intersubjectively created self-group
norms. The risk within this societal construct is the potential for
those individuals or groups for whom the consented norms are anathema or
sufficiently foreign to become, as Habermas puts it, ―neuter‖ (108), and
thus extra-social. Historically, those outside agreed upon value-norms
became socially marginalized and/or stigmatized as abnormal humans. This
ethically problematic bifurcation of society into communal members and
others was partially remedied by the seemingly universal ideological and
structural constructs of liberal political economy and civil law (114).
Citizenship, under these conditions, posited that the individual was
free to trade and associate under the umbrella of certain accepted forms
of economic organization, with corresponding protection of legal
recourse, and varying degrees of access to the election of governmental
representatives. From the foundation of classical political economy and
the liberal social contract, **[historical materialism]{.underline}**
emerged under Marx and [emerges]{.underline} with theorists like
Habermas and others [as a potential approach to transcend]{.underline},
reflectively, [to new modes of living through our dialectical
efforts]{.underline}, as deemed to be appropriate by a collective
identity of social actors. [It represents the chance to socially
experiment with "a collective identity]{.underline} no longer
[tied]{.underline} retrospectively to specific doctrines and forms of
life but [prospectively to programs and rules for bringing about
something"]{.underline} (115). [Pedagogical efforts under this versatile
method could, freed from fetters of ideological prescription, move
progressively with an eye toward problem-solving]{.underline} through
shared and non-violent communicative action. Habermas, however, rightly
points out that the consensual ideal is only possible when ―the
universal validity claims (truth, rightness, truthfulness)‖ (118) are
tacitly recognized by the participants. In contrast, he describes other
modes of social action, like purposive-rational action, where consensus
is circumvented in favor of strategic action. This is grounded in
institutional precepts, like those of a legal system where the norms and
structures are preestablished.

Communicative action requires conscious rationalization of ―truthfulness
of intentional expressions and with the rightness of norms‖ (Habermas
1979, 119). Its authority comes from active consensus building; it is
active for it relies on the intersubjective activity of public
discourse; it is a political form of a socially pragmatic theory of
moral utility. Rationalization is the means by which individuals come
together (for instance, in formal pedagogical spaces) in ways that
require moral-practical discussions of intentions and means, of desires
and aspirations, toward solving any immediate disagreement, social
conflict, or crisis outside of the potential constraints of
retrospective institutional tenets. Regarding this, Habermas (1979) is
worth quoting at length:

Rationalization here means extirpating those relations of force that are
inconspicuously set in the very structures of communication and that
prevent conscious settlement of conflicts\[;\] . . . . progress cannot
be measured against the choice of correct strategies, but rather against
the intersubjectivity of understanding achieved without force, that is,
against the expansion of the domain of consensual action together with
the re-establishment of undistorted communication. (119-120)

[Through attempts at communicative action, we]{.underline} potentially
[circumvent institutional hegemonies that may contribute to the
distortion of communication]{.underline}, or at least cognition, [and
raise the public discourse regarding social conflicts to the level of
immediate consciousness through more rigorous problem-solving
capabilities.]{.underline} Habermas is quick to point out, however, that
the structural norms may preclude attempts at communicative action, and
that not all social cooperation is communicative in the rational sense,
but rather that much is procedurally bound up in the dominant modes of
production and corresponding social life. But, the potential of engaging
in discourse, and the fact that communicative action can exists at all,
renders consensus possible concerning what constitutes progress in modes
of production and in moral social life.

Similar sentiments can be found with Dewey (1963) in terms of the
democratic process being a perpetually unfolding endeavor. Questions
concerning democratic progress, and breaks from the absolutism of
orthodoxy or of reified cultural formations can be described as follows:
The problem under discussion is precisely how conflicting claims are to
be settled in the interest of all - or at least the great majority. The
method of democracy - inasfar as it is that of organized intelligence -
is to bring these conflicts out into the open where their special claims
can be seen and appraised, where they can be discussed and judged in the
light of more inclusive interests than are represented by either of them
separately (79). These inclusive interests find shape in the application
of pragmatic methods to the justice related synthetic problems embedded
within historical materialism; this will be discussed in what follows.
What begins with possible grand ideological prescription, finds its most
poignant application in the alleviation of negative sites of human
emotional and physical existence perhaps following the premise of Marx
(1978) in the Theses on Feuerbach that ―social life is essentially
practical‖ (145). One could also argue that practical life, as
envisioned by Marx and Dewey, is essentially moral in addressing
unnecessary human suffering by seeking to lessen inequalities of social
and economic power. Fruitful analysis and positive change toward the
former, as previously alluded to by Habermas (1975), necessitates the
development of our educational structures concerning ―whether
theoretical-technical and practical questions are differentiated, and
whether discursive learning processes can take place‖ (8). As a vehicle,
Habermas (1989) posits that while inquiry can be socially useful and
beneficial, in many cases it may require engaging memories and texts
engendered by unpleasant and traumatic, often immoral past deeds. Social
evolution, as previously positioned, would also require the development
of an aptitude for the cultivation of this type of memory possession,
introduction, or reclamation, and critically oriented affect and social
action. Part of its practical application is the examination of those
things desired to be forgotten - practical because it seeks to thwart
legacy or repetition in another context yet equally pernicious form. In
pedagogical circles, dialectical inquiry previously discussed should not
avoid the past's less pleasant features such as slavery, genocide, and
other forms of severe and overt oppression caused by either social or
physical (environmental) privation. By way of example, and regarding the
German holocaust, Habermas (1989) states that: Our own life is linked to
the life context in which Auschwitz was possible not by contingent
circumstances but intrinsically. Our form of life is connected with that
of our parents and grandparents through a web of familial, local,
political, and intellectual traditions that is difficult to disentangle
-- that is through a historical milieu that has made us what we are
today. None of us can escape this milieu, because our identities, both
as individuals and as Germans, are indissolubly interwoven with it.
(223) Germans, according to Habermas, have an ―obligation incumbent . .
. to keep alive, without distortion and not only in an intellectual
form, the memory of the sufferings of those who were murdered by German
hands‖ (223). He proposes a version of historical inquiry that resides
in political life, one that finds its vision in the ―abstract idea of
the universalization of democracy and human rights‖ (214). It becomes
evident that historical inquiry cannot avoid trauma, but finds its use
in the formation and projection of a common vision. This vision,
although far from deterministic, seeks to critically penetrate cultural
reifications and lessen alienation and oppression through a liberated
consciousness and ethical action. I posit here that educational spaces
are one of the most obvious and advantageous places for forging this
kind of consciousness through discursive activities. As stated, these
represent potentialities that reside within a pragmatic pedagogical
application of historical materialism rather than inevitable
eventualities should these methods be deployed. However, both pursue a
noble myth or ethic common to both Marxian dialectical materialism and
Deweyan pragmatism - the salient belief that the quality of human
civilization is determined by ethically defensible conjoined living,
interpersonally and within our shared physical environment. The inquiry
and action suggested here is distinctly pragmatic in tenor, and thus
does not necessarily reference an a priori version of democracy, but
rather a commitment to realizing what a given culture might decide to be
the best potentials of negating obstacles to harmonious and just social
life. This is where deploying a pragmatic version of historical
materialism becomes topically useful, but also hopeful in terms of
commitment. Pursuant, Dewey's (1963) conception of democratic effort
does not tell us to ‗re-arm morally' and all social problems will be
solved. It says, Find out how all the constituents of our existing
culture are operating and then see to it that whenever and wherever
needed the be modified in order that their workings may release and
fulfill the possibilities of human nature. (125-126)

[The course of social intelligence, and the task for critical educators,
is to determine the social circumstance in which we have choice and act
accurately]{.underline} according to what is practical on the one hand
and moral on the other.

[The pursuit of dialectical freedom]{.underline}, of the kind spoke of
by Marx, [and the realization of]{.underline} a [universal
human]{.underline} context with regard to [dignity, the aforementioned
mean necessities of life, and the freedom of creation and association,
cannot be realized when the ability to engage in the aforementioned
activities is arrogated by a powerful and democratically disproportional
minority that results in the alienation of the majority.]{.underline}12
Rather than take either the current circumstance, or Marxian analyses
and predictions as historicized and predestined, or requiring violence,
we could choose to interpret it as providing enough wiggle room for
moral choice within what historical circumstances we have been left.
Indeed, in our decision making and actions, it may be more useful to
have aspirations such as love, justice, forgiveness, respect,
creativity, solidarity, reciprocity, and democracy serve as inspiration
for our pedagogical attempts at communication and political activities.
[It is socially useful for the pragmatic use of historical materialism
in educational spaces to favor an organic, critical, and active
philosophical approach to cultural change in order to cut through what
binds social justice. A more equitable democratic life]{.underline},
Dewey (1961) states,

can be won only by extending the application of democratic methods,
methods of consultation, persuasion, negotiation, communication,
co-operative intelligence, in the task of making our own politics,
industry, education, our culture generally, as servant and an evolving
manifestation of democratic ideas . . . . \[and\] can be served only by
the slow day by day adoption and contagious diffusion in every phase of
our common life of methods that are identical with the ends to be
reached. (175-176)

It [can only be won with close attention to accurate cultural analysis,
systemic problem-solving, and reparative strategies that
address]{.underline} both the physical and emotional [wounds left us by
past context and past action.]{.underline} It is for this reason, and
pursuant to the goals already discussed, that [a pragmatic
interpretation of historical materialism]{.underline} is justified. It
[is]{.underline} also [warranted for use in institutions of education to
positively affect the problem solving capabilities of the young toward a
greater understanding of our global context and those cultural and
physical structures that have led to our current conflicts and ethically
indefensible social arrangements.]{.underline}

#### The Aff's theorization of the status quo crushes resistance to material aspects of colonialism by reducing all movements to a binary. 

**Snelgrove et al. 14** (Corey - University of British Columbia; Rita
Kaur Dhamoon, University of Victoria; and Jeff Corntassel, University of
Victoria, 2014, "Unsettling settler colonialism: The discourse and
politics of settlers, and solidarity with Indigenous nations,"
Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education & Society, Vol. 3, No. 2, p.
1-32, http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/view/21166/17970)

[Corey: This]{.underline} relational, [interdependent focus
is]{.underline} also [important amongst settlers ourselves]{.underline}
-- perhaps [as a way to counter the **flattening of differences** that
occurs amongst settlers, particularly in solidarity work. Settlers
obviously need to be]{.underline} doing our own work and
[**challeng**ing 'our' institutions and practices that]{.underline}
serve to protect or [further colonization. But we **can't do this** if
we flatten the differences and ignore the inequalities and power
relationships that exist within settler society. Not only does such
flattening **prevent** much needed **alliances** but
flattening]{.underline} itself [can]{.underline} actually work to
[protect]{.underline} certain [elements of settler
colonialism]{.underline}. For instance, white supremacy works to
naturalize white settler presence. In terms of solidarity then, I find
it problematic for myself, as a white, class privileged, cis-hetero, and
able bodied male (as well as people like me) to demand other peoples to
act in solidarity, while also not holding myself (and others like me)
responsible and accountable to other forms of violence that may be a
contributing factor to the further reification of structures that
support settler colonialism, like the State. Now I'm not arguing for the
continued eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders because
others experience violence, but rather, that [the substantive
recognition of Indigenous governance and legal orders also requires a
dismantling of other, related forms of domination]{.underline}. This
latter dismantling I see as necessary but also insufficient for the
dismantling of settler colonialism. These [sites and spaces of
domination and resistance are distinct, but]{.underline} also [connected
dialectically. This seems to be something that settlers, white settlers
specifically, have yet to articulate and take up, critique and act
against]{.underline}. And [this is]{.underline} perhaps [most evident in
how settlers seem to be continuously waiting for instruction from
Indigenous peoples on how to act]{.underline}. Rita: I wonder if this
relational approach is a more useful direction for settler colonial
studies, not unlike the kind of work you do Jeff, in thinking about
colonialism in a global, comparative context. Jeff: And I think, the
more you can make those links, the British occupation of Maori territory
is directly related to HBC's strategy to begin treaty making here\...
All those things are interrelated. They are shared, and they are seen as
shared strategies. The other thing I see is this impulse to delocalize
it\... it's always that kind of Free Tibet Syndrome\... the further away
acts of genocide are from your location, the more outrage expressed at
these injustices. It's a way of avoiding complicity, but it's also a way
of recasting the gaze. It's like, 'We're not going to look right here,
because this appears to be fairly peaceful' And so it's always that sort
of re-directing away from localized responsibility, and almost
magnifying impacts farther away. [Rita]{.underline}: So what settler
colonial studies does do, is help us relocate to locality, which is
helpful. You mention the HBC. I wonder what was the relationship between
the Hudson Bay Company in Canada and the East India Company or the East
Africa Company? [If we're thinking about settler colonialism as a
structure, how is it related to other modalities of gendered and
sexualized white supremacy?]{.underline} How are the logics of State
sovereignty and authority over nonwhite bodies connected? [If we're
thinking about it, as non-Indigenous peoples being 'in solidarity', part
of that is locating, attacking the whole structure of imperialism that
is deeply gendered and homonationalist, that depends on neo-liberal
projects of prioritizing able-bodied workers who **can serve
capitalism**]{.underline}. [Corey: Part of this]{.underline}, I think,
what we've been discussing here, [relates to]{.underline} what I
sometimes see as [the framing of 'settler' as event, rather than
structure -- where we are perhaps overly focused on the question of
'who' at the expense of the 'how'. If we don't understand how settlers
are produced we **run the risk** of **represent**ing settlers as some
sort of **transhistorical subject with transhistorical
practices**]{.underline}. So I'm worried that [while in one moment the
term 'settler' denaturalizes]{.underline} our -- that is [all
non-Indigenous peoples]{.underline} -- [presence on Indigenous
lands]{.underline}, in the next, and [through this construction of the
'settler' as transhistorical, we **renaturalize it**]{.underline}. In
short, [we go from a disavowal of colonization, to its **representation
as inevitable**. Here is where]{.underline} I think [a **historical
materialist**]{.underline} or genealogical [**approach** to the
production of settler subjects may be useful in **show**ing how this
production is conditioned by but also contingent on a number of factors
-- white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, **capitalism**, colonization, the
eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders, environmental
degradation, etc.]{.underline} Now this is also not to say that the
binary of Indigenous/Settler isn't accurate. I think its fundamental.
Rather, I think [it is]{.underline} possible and [important to recognize
that there]{.underline} have been, and [are]{.underline},
[individuals]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} even
[collectives]{.underline}) [that might be referred to as something other
than settlers by Indigenous peoples, perhaps as cousins]{.underline}. Or
in a similar vein, that [there have been and are practices by settlers
that **aren't colonial**]{.underline} ([and here is where centering
Indigenous peoples' accounts of Indigenous-settler relations, as well as
their own governance, legal and diplomatic orders is
crucial]{.underline}). But I think [it's just as important to recognize
that these relations have and do not occur despite settler colonial and
imperial logics, and]{.underline} thus **[outside of the
binary]{.underline}**. Rather, [such relations occur in the face of
it]{.underline}. The binary then is fundamental as the logics that
uphold the binary cannot be ignored due to the existence of possiblly
good relations as the logics that uphold the binary threaten those
relations through the pursuit of the elimination of Indigenous peoples.
Rita: Yet, how do we act in light of these entanglements, and with,
rather than overcoming differences? [Corey]{.underline}: Tuck and Yang
(2012) had this really great article, "Decolonization is not a
Metaphor." In it, they talk about the importance of an ethics of
incommensurability -- a recognition of how anti-racist and
anti-capitalist struggles are incommensurable with decolonization. But
what I've been thinking about recently is whether these struggles are
incompatible. For example, in the Indigenous resurgence literature,
there is a turn away, but it's also not an outright rejection. It also
demands settlers to change. Yet [recognizing that settlers are
(re)produced, the change demanded is **not just an individual
transformation**, but one **connected** to broader social, economic, and
political justice. There are]{.underline} then, it seems, potential
[**lines of affinity** between decolonization and others]{.underline},
though incommensurable, [struggles]{.underline}. And [in order to
sustain this compatibility]{.underline} in the face of
incommensurability, **[relationships are essential]{.underline}** in
order [to maintain accountability and to resist repeating colonial and
other relations of domination, as well as]{.underline}, in very
strategic terms, [in supporting each other's resistance]{.underline}.

#### The alternative is the [science of historical materialism]{.underline} -- it's the only method capable of demystifying and explaining the [totality of social reality]{.underline} and generating [effective revolutionary strategy and tactics]{.underline}

**Moufawad-Paul 19** -- Professor of Philosophy at York University
(Joshua, "This Ruthless Criticism of All That Exists: Marxism as
Science", Abstrakt,
https://web.archive.org/web/20230330215257/http://www.abstraktdergi.net/this-ruthless-criticism-of-all-that-exists-marxism-as-science/,
January 8, 2019)

**[My contention, which is the contention of classical Marxism, is that
the only thing that secures and grounds the legitimacy of
socio-historical critique is a science that can generate the concrete
operations necessary to demystify and explain the social and
historical]{.underline}**. If we do not accept this axiom as the basis
of Marxism then there is no reason to treat Marxism as any more
meaningful than other theoretical approaches concerned with the same
socio-historical phenomena. At the very least we can treat Marxism as no
less important than those tendencies that are used to critique it, but
without the qualification of science there is no reason to pretend it is
any more significant than what even those Marxists who reject the
qualification of "science" hope to critique. That is, we cannot critique
competing theoretical tendencies as Marxists in a meaningful sense if we
do not respect the scientific meaning of our theoretical terrain----this
would be akin to critiquing astrology from the position of astronomy
while simultaneously asserting that the latter is not superior because
of its status as a science.

**[Accepting that Marxism is scientific does not]{.underline}**, by the
very condition of science, **[mean that we are unable to criticize the
erroneous positions of Marx, Engels, and other theorists within this
terrain]{.underline}**. In fact, according to the very concept, the
opposite is the case: **[a science stands above and beyond its
theoretical contributors]{.underline}**. We know, for example, that
Darwin was a racist just as we also know that this undeniable fact does
not mean that the theory of natural selection is racist, let alone
incorrect. **[Recognizing Darwin's racism]{.underline}**, however,
**[allows us to distinguish between the scientific aspects of his work
from those ideological aspects]{.underline}**, with the latter being
justly castigated and discarded whereas the former are upheld. There is
a reason that The Descent of Man has been of little scientific use (it
is by-and-large racism masquerading as science) whereas On The Origin of
the Species initiates the discipline of biology. And though it is indeed
the case that the scientific study of biology can be used in the
interest of ruling class ideology, it is not the case that the theory of
natural selection is "wrong"----there are antibiotics and vaccinations
that exist and work directly as a result of this theory.

Moreover, **[it is the science of historical materialism that first
generated the theoretical approach that permits us to understand the
ideological instance, the ways in which the ruling ideas of the ruling
class can distort our understanding and knowledge
production]{.underline}**. **[Historical materialism teaches us
that "every science... is constantly submitted to the onslaught of
existing ideologies."]{.underline}** (Althusser, 2011:
12)**^9^** **[Such an insight, which is repeatable and concrete, is what
allows Marxism to make the same distinction between science and
ideology]{.underline}** within its own theoretical terrain. "**[What
goes for the sciences holds in the first place for historical
materialism itself, which is a science among others and holds no
privilege of immunity in this matter]{.underline}**." (Ibid.) For
example, the fact that Robert Biel could write Eurocentrism and the
Communist Movement so as to critique the Eurocentrism within the history
of communism from a Marxist perspective ----and expose this history
better than post-Marxist thinkers have ever done---- speaks to the
strength of the science. As aforementioned, **[we have a name for the
ideological distortion of Marxism: revisionism]{.underline}**. Hence,
just as Newton was subjected to gravity, **[the theorists of historical
materialism are subjected to class struggle]{.underline}**.

Other theoretical tendencies that seek to displace Marxism are incapable
of this recursive movement. For example, criticizing Derrida from a
Derridian perspective results in an infinite regress of language games:
reading the limits of his theory of différance according to the concept
of différance produces incoherence rather than insight. There is nothing
foundationally significant about these radical theoretical tendencies
that seek to displace Marxism, a characteristic that many of them in
fact celebrate. The opposition to the language of universality, to
concrete foundations, to that totalizing Enlightenment narrative that is
named "science" is precisely what these alternative tendencies seek to
displace.

But **[it is the claim that Marxism is a science that allows Marxists to
expropriate notions generated by other theoretical tendencies and
repurpose them]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[Marxism has a history of
borrowing and transforming non-scientific notions from other theoretical
tendencies]{.underline}**. For instance, **[Marx borrowed from Smith and
Ricardo just as Lenin would later borrow from Hobson and
Hilferding]{.underline}**. Every science has promoted the expropriation
of non-scientific/pre-scientific fields; hence modern particle physics
begins with the expropriation of the ancient notion of the atom. The
notion is transformed under the rubric of modern science, however, and
this transformation is significant because it generates the kind of
meaning that non-scientific approaches cannot.

And yet the rejection of Marxism is often premised on the rejection of
Enlightenment thought that speaks in the name of science. That is,
Marxism is dismissed as old-fashioned and Eurocentric precisely because
it has articulated itself *as a science*. There is a strangeness
underlying this criticism since, as aforementioned, those who make it
are not as a whole opposed to scientific claims (they benefit from
science, they would not choose to receive brain surgery from someone
practicing holistic medicine whatever they might say in theory), and so
we must ask why is Marxism singled out over and above the so-called hard
sciences? Such a perspective mimics the claims made by reactionary STEM
academics who refuse to conceive of the possibility that anything
outside of physics, biology, chemistry, math, and engineering can
qualify as properly scientific. More than this: **[the targeting of
Marxism as a monstrous outgrowth of the Enlightenment functions to
quarantine the only theoretical tendency that can generate a
revolutionary critique of business as usual, the predatory business
inherited by the bourgeois containment of modernity]{.underline}**.

Thus, in the face of this theoretical collapse of theoretical reasoning
(since the only theoretical tendency capable of critiquing reality is
Marxism) we must reassert the scientific legacy of Marxism. **[This
legacy is not the inheritance of academics and petty-bourgeois
intellectuals]{.underline}**, however, **[but belongs to the wretched of
the earth]{.underline}**. **[The science of historical materialism
judged as a total theoretical terrain that incorporates the great molar
movements----from Marx, through Lenin, and then through Mao----is a
weapon for the proletarian movement]{.underline}**. **[All attempts to
blunt this weapon or relegate it to the dusty shelves of antiquity
coincide, regardless of intention, with the ruling class desire to
neutralize its potential gravedigger]{.underline}**.

4\) On revolutionary science

In Socialism: Utopian and *Scientific* Engels summarizes the essential
concerns of the Marxist project by demarcating it from what it is not.
**[Rather than being simply a philosophy where socialism is presented as
an ethical prescription]{.underline}** ----a more just and modern
version of Plato's Republic, a more reasonable future state than what
the empiricists or utilitarians promised---- **[socialism is instead
derived as a necessity following the scientific assessment of the past
and present]{.underline}**. Philosophical socialism is a utopian
approach to the problematic of history/society where "every old
traditional notion was flung into the lumber room as irrational; the
world had hitherto allowed itself to be led solely by prejudices;
everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now, for the
first time, appeared the light of day, the kingdom of reason; henceforth
superstition, injustice, privilege, oppression, were to be superseded by
eternal truth, eternal right, equality based on nature and the
inalienable rights of man." (Engels, 1998: 32) The socialism aimed at by
the Marxist approach, however, is not directed by the utopian sentiment
of "inalienable rights" or "the kingdom of reason." The pre-Marxist
utopian fantasy, which projected the highest moral aspirations of the
bourgeois order into a stable future, is logically identical to
imagining the mechanical 19th century principles of physics projected
unto the future: a fiction that, at best, gives us only a glimpse of
emancipation. 19th century physicists could not call themselves
"scientists" if they just imagined future technologies, projecting
present values into a temporally distant state of affairs. H.G. Wells
and Jules Verne produced late 19th century Science Fiction but they did
not produce science.

Here it is worth pointing out that those claims that relegate Marxism to
a purely Enlightenment status fail to recognize that **[Marxism's claim
to science is premised on a rejection of the authority of the dominant
aspects of Enlightenment philosophy]{.underline}**. Utopian socialism
perfectly represents Enlightenment thought due to its idealization of a
kingdom of reason derived from the most ideal expression of bourgeois
social relations. But this approach to socialism is about as practically
useful as writing a novel about future technology. **[What Marxism did
was historicize philosophy, including Enlightenment philosophy, in a
scientific manner that revealed the class ideology behind all "rational"
claims about morality and political meaning]{.underline}**. **[In order
to understand a socialist politics concretely ----in order to actually
pursue this politics---- meant that appealing to abstract notions of
Reason and Man were as meaningful as Plato's appeal to the Form of
Justice since both were generated by the class composition of their
respective modes of production, as are all political-moral judgements
right up to contemporary articulations of political
philosophy]{.underline}**.

Hence, **[the radicality of historical materialism as a science is that,
it can be understood according to the following criteria]{.underline}**
that function simultaneously: **[i) in every period of its development
(because like any scientific terrain it does develop) Marxism is
historically mediated and limited by time and space; ii) Marxism's
scientific characteristics]{.underline}** (which are open to the future)
**[mean that it is also beyond every period in which it finds itself and
can thus hold its own limitations to account]{.underline}**. From its
very origins Marxism was able to push beyond the limits of the bourgeois
directed Enlightenment, holding Enlightenment thought itself to account
by historicizing it and revealing the class struggle behind the facade
of abstract modernity. Now, following both its own development and
internal controversies, **[Marxism can perform the same demystifying
function for every philosophy and theoretical tendency of the
contemporary era]{.underline}**.

Therefore, **[Marxism stands above those other theoretical tendencies
that attempt to replace, supersede, or ignore its influence because it
has the potential to do what these other theories cannot: fully grasp
the concrete circumstances of a concrete situation, demystify historical
and social phenomena, provide the explanatory depth that is missing from
these alternative accounts, and even appropriate aspects of these other
accounts into its general methodology]{.underline}**. Since it is able
to turn this perspective upon itself because it has also, like other
sciences, developed and transformed according to paradigm shifts and
epistemic ruptures, it proves its strength: **[it is simultaneously
bound by history and transcendent of history]{.underline}**. Historical
materialism is limited by the historical periods in which it is
practiced (which is why Marx and others can make mistakes) while also
possessing the tools to critique this very thing. It is mediated by
history and yet can also be abstracted from history to make this very
point. It can comprehend the movement of history while still being
within this movement ----like the procedure of physics which establishes
the historical moment of Newton's law of gravity but also transcends
this moment with Einstein's transformed theory of gravity. Other
theoretical tendencies that function to displace Marxism cannot make the
same claims; they are always bound, like the Utopian Socialists and
their kingdom of reason, to the very circumstances of history that
Marxism unveils. Their strongest and most useful insights are those they
have inherited from the Marxist tradition.

**[Most importantly]{.underline}**, though, **[this science of Marxism
is revolutionary science]{.underline}**. **[If each science possesses a
corresponding practice]{.underline}** (i.e. the laboratories and
theoretical methods of chemistry, for example, are particular to its
field), **[then historical materialism's practice is
revolution]{.underline}**. That is, **[Marxism is not simply an
analytical framework]{.underline}** used to examine historical and
social phenomena ----though it is also this---- **[but only functions as
such a framework inasmuch as it develops according to its fundamental
axiom: class struggle is the motor of history]{.underline}**. When Lenin
wrote that **["\[w\]ithout revolutionary theory there can be no
revolutionary movement"]{.underline}** (Lenin, 1987: 69) he was not
asserting the logical priority of theory over practice, as this
statement is sometimes read. Rather, the statement was intended as
symmetrical. This symmetry is attested by Lenin's disdain for those
Marxist thinkers who, like the Utopian Socialists, were not active in
what Marx and Engels called "the real movement which abolishes the
present state of things." (Marx and Engels, 1998: 57) Hence it is also
the case that **[without a revolutionary movement there can be no
theory: practice and theory are different articulations of a singular
scientific totality]{.underline}**.

The conclusion of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific makes the above
relationship clear: **[i) scientific socialism is defined as "the
theoretical expression of the proletarian movement"; ii) "universal
emancipation is the mission of the modern proletariat"; iii)
understanding this "mission" requires both the necessity of action and
"a full knowledge of the \[historical\] conditions and of the meaning of
the momentous act of revolution."]{.underline}** (Engels, 1998: 75)
**[This science is thus proclaimed as a revolutionary science that
belongs to, and can only be developed by, "the proletarian
movement."]{.underline}** That is, this science is wagered as a science
if and only if it is intimately linked to making revolution.

**[Lest we be dismissed by those competing theoretical tendencies that
imagine that they alone have theorized the insights of
"intersectionality"----and thus focus on the qualifier of "proletarian"
to accuse Marxism of a crude class reductionism that excludes race,
gender, etc. from the register of resistance ----we should be clear: the
Marxist tradition has a long history of thinking the composition of the
proletariat beyond economism and workerism]{.underline}**. At the same
time, however, **["proletarian" is a qualifier that can only be
dismissed by those who refuse a scientific understanding of human
existence]{.underline}**. **[Whatever the composition of this
proletariat might be ----however it is clearly determined by multiple
structures of oppression---- any honest and empirical assessment of
reality must conclude that]{.underline}**, when we look at the entire
world, **[the majority of humans toil under violent conditions of
exploitation so that a minority of the global population can possess
less vulnerable and more enriched lives]{.underline}**.

Thus **[to grasp the meaning of social reality in totality is only
possible through that "ruthless criticism of all that exists," the
science that first demystified social-historical phenomena to theorize
the historical instantiations of class struggle, the modes of
production, through which all forms of oppression (as well as
ideologies, states, institutions, and life in general) are articulated
and mediated]{.underline}**. Although the multiple post-Marxist
philosophical detours disdain the notion of grasping social reality in
its totality,**^10^** there is no reason to accept this critique as
justified beyond its status as an academic fad that was generated in the
latter days of the Cold War.**^11^** Most importantly, though, these
detours have produced nothing significant beyond an endless and
increasingly arcane interpretation of social phenomena ----the very
thing that Marx already accused philosophy of doing in the 11th thesis
on Feuerbach! **[The point is to "change the world" which is more than
just an analysis of the status of affairs in its
totality]{.underline}**. **[Beyond the theorization of history and
society historical materialism also generates theories of revolutionary
strategy and organization]{.underline}**, **[just as physics and biology
generate their respective instruments or laboratories]{.underline}**.
**[This is where science begins and non-scientific theory
ends]{.underline}**.

## Impact Framing 

#### Structural violence outweighs -- it creates all forms of macro-level violence -- obscuring its role guarantees future conflicts - reject their appeals to empirical evidence because suffering cannot be captured in a dataset -- only centering impact calc on affect can arrive at truth

places? Cultural practice, neoliberal rationalism, and virulent
imaginative geographies," Political Geography (30) pp. 90-98)

 (Simon, "Violence sits in places? Cultural practice, neoliberal
rationalism, and virulent imaginative geographies," Political Geography
(30) pp. 90-98)

The confounding effects of violence ensure that it is a phenomena shot
through with a certain perceptual blindness. In his monumental essay
'Critique of Violence', Walter Benjamin (1986) exposed our unremitting
tendency to obscure violence in its institutionalized forms, and because
of this opacity, our inclination to regard violence exclusively as
something we can see through its direct expression. Yet [the structural
violence]{.underline} [resulting from our **political and economic
systems**]{.underline} ( Farmer, 2004 and Galtung, 1969), [and the
**symbolic violence** born]{.underline} [of our discourses]{.underline}
( Bourdieu, 2001 and Jiwani, 2006), [are]{.underline} something **[like
the dark matter of physics]{.underline}**, '\[[they\] may be invisible,
but \[they have\] to be taken into account if one is to make sense of
what might otherwise seem to be 'irrational' explosions of]{.underline}
subjective \[or direct\] [violence']{.underline} ( Zizek, 2008: 2).
[These seemingly invisible]{.underline} [geographies]{.underline} of
violence -- including the hidden fist of the market itself -- [have both
'nonillusory]{.underline} [effects']{.underline} ( Springer, 2008) [and
pathogenic affects in afflicting human bodies that **create
suffering**]{.underline} ( Farmer, 2003), which can be seen if one cares
to look critically enough. Yet, [because of their sheer
**pervasiveness**, **systematization**, and **banality**]{.underline}
[we are all too frequently blinded from seeing that which is perhaps
**most obvious**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} itself [marks an
**epistemological downward spiral**]{.underline}, [as 'the economic' in
particular is evermore abstracted and **its 'real world'
implications**]{.underline} [are increasingly erased from collective
consciousnes]{.underline}s ( Hart, 2008[). 'The clearest available
example of such epistemic violence']{.underline}, Gayatri Spivak (1988:
24--25) contends, '[is the remotely orchestrate]{.underline}d,
far-flung, [and heterogeneous project to constitute the colonial subject
as Other']{.underline}, and it is here that the relationship between
Orientalism and neoliberalism is revealed. Since Orientalism is a
discourse that functions precisely due to its ability to conceal an
underlying symbolic violence (Tuastad, 2003), and because the structural
violence of poverty and inequality that stems from the political
economies of neoliberalism is cast as illusory (Springer, 2008), my
reflections on neoliberalism, Orientalism, and their resultant
imaginative and material violent geographies are, as presented here,
purposefully theoretical. As Derek Gregory (1993: 275) passionately
argues, 'human geographers have to work with social theory...
**[Empiricism is not an option]{.underline}**, if it ever was, [because
the "facts" do not]{.underline} (**[and never will]{.underline}**)
**["speak for themselves",]{.underline}** **[no matter how closely... we
listen'.]{.underline}** [Although the 'facts' of violence can be
**assembled**,]{.underline} **[tallied]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[categorized]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} cultural **[scope and
emotional weight]{.underline}** [of violence can never be entirely
captured through empirical analysis]{.underline}. After Auschwitz, and
now after 9/11, casting a sideways glance at violence through [the
poetic abstractions of theory must be considered as an **enabling
possibility**]{.underline}. This is particularly the case with respect
to understanding the geographies of violence, as our understandings of
space and place are also largely poetic (Bachelard, 1964 and Kong, 2001)

Latin America: The Cycle of Ideas and the Search for an Alternative"
*Latin American Perspectives* 34 p. 31-32

**[One helpful perspective is to focus attention]{.underline}** **[on
the generation, diffusion, and adoption of a set of ideas about economic
policy]{.underline}** and, most important, on why the elite consensus
achieved in the 1980s did not hold. **[This seems particularly relevant
if we are to say something]{.underline}** **[about the content of future
economic policy]{.underline}** in the region. Seen from this angle, the
first question is therefore how neoliberal ideas became accepted by
policy elites and incorporated into policies as crucial components of a
new development strategy. This is an aspect of the process of reform
that has been relatively little studied, but its relevance has been
acknowledged from several perspectives. Indeed, after reviewing
alternative explanations for reform, Haggard and Kaufman (1992: 36)
conclude: In the final analysis, it is entirely possible that neither
interest-based explanations nor institutional ones will be entirely
satisfactory for explaining how societies cope with the challenges of
policy reform and consolidation. Consolidation may also require the
evolution of a broader ideational consensus among leaders, interest
groups, party elites, and attentive publics that sets some boundaries on
the range of economic debate. **[Long-term sustainability of policy
choices will depend on a convergence of thinking about fundamental
means-ends relationships in the economy]{.underline}**. Then, the
formation of elite preferences, ideas, and ideology, as well as the
evolution of public opinion, are potentially important explanatory
variables. In addition, **[studies about the impact of ideas on economic
and foreign policy making highlight the relevance of
ideas]{.underline}**, particularly **[in reference to processes of
substantial policy innovation]{.underline}** such as the neoliberal turn
examined here. Peter Hall (1989: 361) argues, "It is ideas, in the form
of economic theories and the policies developed from them, that enable
national leaders to chart a course through turbulent economic times, and
ideas about what is efficient, expedient, and just that motivate the
movement from one line of policy to another." Comparative research
indicates that there are at least three ways in which ideas may
influence policy outcomes. **[Ideas may serve as road maps, helping
actors to assess their preferences and the alternatives available to
reach their goals]{.underline}**. They may affect strategic interactions
by facilitating or hindering cooperative efforts. **[They may also have
a long-lasting influence once they become institutionalized, thus
constraining future policy choices]{.underline}** (Goldstein and
Keohane, 1993). Undoubtedly, **[the capacity of the neoliberal discourse
to provide a simple answer to the crisis of the 1980s illustrates the
impact of ideas on policy makers' actions]{.underline}**. The crisis
helped to undermine the already discredited policies of the past and
opened a window of opportunity for new ideas. Despite some criticism and
resistance, the exhaustion of import-substitution industrialization, the
failure of heterodox experiments, and the sense of urgency generated by
a deepening economic crisis paved the way for a relatively widespread
acquiescence in policy innovation. The literature on structural reforms
in Latin America has, however, only indirectly addressed ideational
issues. There are extensive studies on the role of technocrats or
technocratic teams who, acting in tandem with strong executives in the
most aggressive cases of reform in the region, became the "transmission
belts" for the diffusion and implementation of policy recommendations.
They embodied the consensus and worked as amalgamators of different
interests within the new governing coalitions (Centeno and Silva, 1998).
These studies clearly provide us with a grounded explanation of the
diffusion of ideas. As Hall (1989: 390) reminds us, "ideas have real
power in the political world, but they do not acquire political force
independently of the constellation of institutions and interests already
present there." Furthermore, **[technocratic cadres are part of the
rising transnational elite who are now pursuing a post--Washington
Consensus as one way of solving global economic problems and securing
the legitimacy of the capitalist system]{.underline}** (Robinson, 2005).
However, a critical cadre of officials was sometimes absent or failed to
obtain the necessary political support, and in these cases the reform
attempt failed (e.g., Venezuela under Carlos Andrés Pérez, 1989--1993).
Also, looking at those actors and their positions in the decision-making
structures does not tell us much about the ideas they promoted. The
policies recently adopted in Latin America did not originate in the
region; technocrats imported them from developed countries. The
consensus formed around the new policy orientation emanated mainly from
intellectual and policy circles in the United States and was endorsed by
international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank. Thus, although the insights provided by studies on
technocrats' socialization and professional networks are relevant, we
need to know more about the links and alliances between domestic and
foreign policy elites that provided the basis for a new coalition with
vested interests in the reforms and the mechanisms through which their
shared views contributed to the formation of widespread consensus. In
fact, those links were not a new phenomenon. **[The promotion of
neoliberal policies]{.underline}** in Latin America by the United States
**[can be seen as part of a long-term process of expansion, rebuilding,
and consolidation of U.S. hegemony]{.underline}**. The technocrats
mentioned above resemble the U.S. consultants who promoted laissez-faire
ideas across the region from 1890 to 1920 (Drake, 2000). Then and now,
**[economic policy consensus served the hegemon's interest by persuading
subordinate states to accept certain rules of the game]{.underline}**,
this time **[reinforced by]{.underline}** a new enforcement mechanism
(**[financial conditionality]{.underline}**) and complemented by a
renewed impulse toward the promotion of democracy. Yet, according to
Robinson (2005), what the current attempt entails is not another round
of old-style imperialism but rather new and more subtle forms of global
capitalist domination. In his words (1999: 44), **[Neoliberalism is the
"grease" by which global capitalism tears down all nonmarket structures
that have in the past placed limits on, or acted as a protective layer
against, the accumulation of capital]{.underline}**. By prying open and
making accessible to transnational capital every layer of the social
fabric, **[neoliberalism extricates the global economy from global
society, and the state defers to the market as the sole organizing
power]{.underline}** **[in the economic and social
sphere]{.underline}**.

#### Critique of political economy is a [prior question]{.underline}---changing our [energy]{.underline} inputs without [social]{.underline} criticism ensures perpetual deferral of social justice in favor of capitalist interests.

director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the
University of Delaware; **AND** Noah **TOLY**, Research Associate Center
for Energy and Environmental Policy at Delaware, **'6** \["Energy as a
Social Project: Recovering a Discourse" in *Transforming Power*, ed. by
Byrne, Toly, & Glover, 2006, p. 22-24\]

**[Transition without Change]{.underline}**: A Failing Discourse

After more than thirty years of contested discourse, the **[major
\'energy futures\' under consideration appear committed to the
prevailing systems of governance and political economy]{.underline}**
that animate late modernity. The **[new
technologies]{.underline}**---**[conventional or
sustainable]{.underline}**---**[that will govern the energy sector and
accumulate capital]{.underline}** might be described as centaurian
technics 21 in which **[the crude efficiency of the fossil energy era is
bestowed a new sheen by high technologies and modernized
ecosystems]{.underline}**: capitalism without smoky cities, \[END PAGE
22\] contaminated industrial landscapes, or an excessively carbonized
atmosphere. Emerging energy solutions are poised to realize a postmodern
transition (Roosevelt, 2002), but their shared commitment to capitalist
political economy and the democratic-authoritarian bargain lend credence
to Jameson\'s assessment (1991) of postmodernism as the \"cultural logic
of late capitalism.\"

Differences in ecological commitments between conventional and
sustainable energy strategies still demarcate a battleground that, we
agree, is important---even fundamental. But so also are the common
aspirations of the two camps. **[Each sublimates social considerations
in favor of a politics of more-is-better, and each regards the advance
of energy capitalism with a sense of inevitability]{.underline}** and
triumph. **[Conventional and sustainable energy visions equally presume
that a social order governed by a \'democratic\' ideal of cornucopia,
marked by economic plenty, and delivered by technological marvels will
eventually lance the wounds of poverty and inequality]{.underline}** and
start the healing process. Consequently, **[silence on questions of
governance and social justice is studiously observed by
both]{.underline}** proposals. Likewise, both agree to, or demur on, the
question of capitalism's sustainability. 22 Nothing is said on these
questions because, apparently, nothing needs to be.

If the above assessment of the **[contemporary energy
discourse]{.underline}** is correct, then the enterprise **[is not at a
crossroad]{.underline}**; rather, **[it has reached a point of
acquiescence to things as they are. Building an inquiry into energy as a
social project will require the recovery of a critical voice that can
interrogate, rather than concede, the discourse's current moorings in
technological politics and capitalist political economy. A fertile
direction]{.underline}** in this regard **[is to investigate an
energy-society order in which energy systems evolve in response to
social values]{.underline}** and goals, **[and not simply according to
the dictates of technique, prices, or capital]{.underline}**. Initial
interest in renewable energy by the sustainability camp no doubt
emanated, at least in part, from the fact that its fuel price is
non-existent and that capitalization of systems to collect renewable
sources need not involve the extravagant, convoluted corporate forms
that manage the conventional energy regime. But forgotten, or
misunderstood, in the attraction of renewable energy have been the
social origins of such emergent possibilities. Communities exist today
who address energy needs outside the global marketplace: they are often
rural in character and organize energy services that are immune to oil
price spikes and do not require water heated to between 550º and 900º
Fahrenheit (300º and 500º Celsius) (the typical temperatures in nuclear
reactors). No energy bills are sent or paid and governance of the
serving infrastructure is based on local (rather than distantly
developed professional) knowledge. Needless to say, **[sustainability is
embodied in the lifeworld of]{.underline}** these **[communities, unlike
the modern strategy that hopes to design sustainability into its
technology and economics so as not to seriously change its otherwise
unsustainable way of life]{.underline}**. \[END PAGE 23\]

Predictably, **[modern society will underscore its wealth and technical
acumen as evidence of its superiority]{.underline}** over alternatives.
**[But]{.underline}** smugness cannot overcome the fact that
**[energy-society relations are evident in which the bribe of
democratic-authoritarianism and the unsustainability of energy
capitalism are successfully declined]{.underline}**. In 1928, Mahatma
Gandhi (cited in Gandhi, 1965: 52) explained why the
democratic-authoritarian bargain and Western capitalism should be
rejected:

God forbid that India should ever take to industrialization after the
manner of the West. The economic imperialism of a single tiny island
kingdom (England) is today keeping the world in chains. If an entire
nation of 300 million took to similar economic exploitation, it would
strip the world bare like locusts. Unless the capitalists of India help
to avert that tragedy by becoming trustees of the welfare of the masses
and by devoting their talents not to amassing wealth for themselves but
to the service of the masses in an altruistic spirit, they will end
either by destroying the masses or being destroyed by them.

As Gandhi\'s remark reveals, **[social inequality resides not in access
to electric light and other accoutrements of modernity, but in a world
order that places efficiency and wealth above life-affirming ways of
life. This is our social problem, our energy problem, our ecological
problem]{.underline}**, and, generally, our political-economic problem.

**[terrain of inevitable catastrophe.]{.underline}** The great tragedy
of the current historical moment is that we can imagine this world all
too easily, for it is the picture of the world that dominates the
realities of our present condition. It is a world most people experience
on a daily basis - a world that has become normalized and for which
there is no immediate alternative - a world we understand as
neoliberalism.

Neoliberal power is unmediated in its effects on people as it operates
throughout the global space of unregulated flows. Whereas in an earlier
industrial period capital was largely rooted and peoples migrated, for
the most part today capital flows while peoples are contained. What
becomes of sovereignty in this economically driven environment is a
military and policing protectorate put to the service of global capital
in ways that work by condemning the already condemned. At the same time,
neoliberal ideology, policies, and modes of governing are normalized as
if there is no outside or alternative to capitalism. As corporate power
replaces political sovereignty, **[politics becomes an extension of war
and all public spaces are transformed into battle zones]{.underline}**.
Not only are all vestiges of the social contract, the safety net, and
institutions of democracy under siege, but so too are all public spheres
that support non-market values such as trust, critical dialogue, and
solidarity. How else to explain Heartland Institute President Joseph
Best denouncing public schools as \"socialist regimes.\" Paul Buchheit
is right in arguing that \"privatizers believe that any form of working
together as a community is anti-American. To them, individual
achievement is all that matters. They\'re now applying their
winner-take-all profit motive to our children.\" They are also punishing
those individuals, groups, and institutions that refuse the
individualized and cut throat values of a market-driven casino
capitalism.

At the same time, under the interlocking regimes of neoliberal power,
violence appears so arbitrary and thoughtless that it lacks the need for
any justification, let alone claims to justice and accountability. It is
truly as limitless as it appears banal. All that matters instead is to
re-create the very conditions to further and deepen the crises of
neoliberal rule. Violence, with its ever-present economy of uncertainty,
fear, and terror, is no longer merely a side effect of police brutality,
war, or criminal behavior; it has become fundamental to neoliberalism as
a particularly savage facet of capitalism. And in doing so it has turned
out to be central to legitimating those social relations in which the
political and pedagogical are redefined in order to undercut
possibilities for authentic democracy. Under such circumstances, the
social becomes retrograde, emptied of any democratic values, and
organized around a culture of shared anxieties rather than shared
responsibilities. The contemporary world, then - the world of
neoliberalism - creates the most monstrous of illusions, one that
functions by hiding things in plain sight. We see this most troublingly
played out as its simulated spectacles of destruction are scripted in
such a way as to support the narrative that violence itself is enjoying
a veritable decline as a result of liberal influence and pacification.
Howard Zinn understood this perversion better than most:

I start from the supposition that the world is topsy-turvy, that things
are all wrong, that the wrong people are in jail and the wrong people
are out of jail, that the wrong people are in power and the wrong people
are out of power, that the wealth is distributed in this country and the
world in such a way as not simply to require small reform but to require
a drastic reallocation of wealth. I start from the supposition that we
don\'t have to say too much about this because all we have to do is
think about the state of the world today and realize that things are all
upside down.\[1\]

**[There is no greater task today]{.underline}** **[than to develop a
critique of violence adequate to our deeply unjust, inequitable, and
violent times]{.underline}**. **[Only then]{.underline}** **[might we
grasp the magnitude and depths of suffering]{.underline}** endured on a
daily basis by many of the world\'s citizens. Only then might we move
**[beyond the]{.underline}** conceit of a **[neoliberal
project]{.underline}**, which has normalized violence such that its
worst manifestations become part of our cultural \"pastimes.\" And
**[only then]{.underline}** **[might we reignite a radical
imagination]{.underline}** **[that is capable of diagnosing the violence
of the present in such a manner that we have the confidence to rethink
the meaning of global citizenship in the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}**

Following on from the enduring legacy and inspiration of Zinn and other
cautionary voices of political concern such as Paulo Freire, our
critique begins from the supposition that mass violence today must be
understood by comprehending the ways in which systemic cruelty is
transformed into questions of individual pathology. What is more, with
the burden of guilt placed on the shoulders of the already condemned,
those whose lives are rendered disposable, **[we must question more
rigorously the imaginaries of violence]{.underline}**, **[which
instigate a forced partaking in a system that encourages the subjugated
to embrace]{.underline}** their **[oppression]{.underline}** as though
it were their liberation. Nowhere is this more apparent today than in
the doctrine of \"resilience\" which, as critiqued elsewhere, forces us
to accept our vulnerabilities without providing us with the tools for
genuine transformation of those systematic processes that render us
insecure in the first place.\[2\] **[Neoliberalism\'s culture of
violence is reinforced by]{.underline}** what Zsuza Ferge calls the
\"**[individualization of the social,\"]{.underline}**\[3\] in **[which
all traces of the broader structural forces producing a range of social
problems such as widening inequality and mass poverty
disappear.]{.underline}** Under the regime of neoliberalism,
**[individual responsibility becomes the only politics that matters and
serves to blame those who are susceptible to larger systemic
forces]{.underline}**. Even though such problems are not of their own
making, neoliberalism\'s discourse insists that the fate of the
vulnerable is a product of personal issues ranging from weak character
to bad choices or simply moral deficiencies. This makes it easier for
its advocates to argue that \"**[poverty is a deserved
condition]{.underline}**.\"\[4\]

Systematic violence has never been \"exceptional\" in the history of
capitalistic development. How might we explain David Harvey\'s apt
description of capitalist expansion as \"accumulation by
dispossession,\"\[5\] if the rise of capitalism did not signal the
advent of a truly predatory social formation? Indeed, even the
contemporary **[advocates of neoliberal markets recognize]{.underline}**
that **[their notion of a \"just world\" depends on coercion and
violence]{.underline}** **[as a way to enforce capitalism\'s uneven
distribution of wealth and impoverishment.]{.underline}**

As the Oxford economic historian Avner Offer explained to Chris Hedges,
\"those who suffer deserve to suffer.\"\[6\] **[The neoliberal model
is,]{.underline}** after all, \"**[a warrant for inflicting
pain.\"\[]{.underline}**7\] **[The regime]{.underline}** of
neoliberalism **[is precisely organized for the production of
violence.]{.underline}** Such **[violence is more than symbolic. Instead
of waging a war on poverty it wages a war on the poor]{.underline}** -
**[and does so removed from any concern for social costs or ethical
violations]{.underline}**. Such a brutal diagnosis argues in favor of a
neoliberal model despite its perverse outcomes: \"**[It is perhaps
symptomatic that the USA, a society that elevates freedom to the highest
position among]{.underline}** its values, **[is also]{.underline}** the
**[one that has one of the very largest penal systems in the world
relative to its population]{.underline}**. **[It]{.underline}** also
**[inflicts violence all over the world]{.underline}**. **[It tolerates
a great deal of gun violence, and a health service that excludes large

[A prominent way to promote decolonial thinking in the concept of

sustainability]{.underline} (IPMG 2015; Mastrángelo et al. 2019). These
understandings are markedly different from the Western perspective as
they rely on contextualization and relatedness rather than on normative
universality and analytical separation of humans and environment
(Virtanen et al. 2020). Indigenous knowledge emphasizes reciprocity and
connectivity and strives to sustain this relationship (Behe et al.
2018). [Contextualized, nuanced and multigenerational experience-based
interpretation of healthy relationships within interrelated, holistic

[Humans, nonhumans, and nature relations are central to Indigenous
understandings of sustainability and they are determined by the

(Cruikshank 2005; Krupnik and Jolly 2010). This relationship encompasses
the obligation to safeguard the territory through everyday spiritual and
physical practice and interaction which has been time tested (Stevenson

responsibility, ethics, customary law, and ownership. These values are
embedded in Indigenous cultures and languages, which provide endless

11.1 Introduction

The sustainability of modern economic growth, as it developed in the
todays Western industrialized economies from the beginning of the
industrial revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, has been
questioned at the latest since 1972 when the book The Limits to Growth
was published by the Club of Rome (Meadows et al. 1972). After more than
200 years of industrial production, large parts of the world population
are richer than ever before. However, industrial production in its
current form is also closely linked with the exploitation of natural
resources and the strong accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, endangering human survival. [In economics two fundamentally
different solution strategies are discussed as a reaction
on]{.underline} man-made [climate change and]{.underline} irreversible
[environmental damages: (1) conservation of resources by growth
abstinence and (2) decoupling of growth]{.underline} and exploitation of
resources. In this chapter, we show that [the first
perspective]{.underline} with its emphasis on the efficiency of price
competition [is not suited to conceive a transformation of the
production system towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy]{.underline}.
[Only the emphasis of the superiority of innovation competition,
inherent to the second perspective, allows for the inclusion of the
required transformative perspective]{.underline}.

[The supporters of the first approach]{.underline} (e.g., Blewitt and
Cunningham 2014; Kallis et al. 2014), [summarized under the headings of
abstinence and downscaling, claim a renunciation of our lifestyles based
on consumption]{.underline} and increasing deployment of resources. This
is considered the only way to enable a sustainable and
environment-friendly lifestyle and form of economic activity. At first
sight, it might look surprising that [these growth-hostile approaches
are strictly in line with the thinking put forward in mainstream
neoclassical growth theories]{.underline}. This follows from the fact
that [the standard neoclassical approach relies on the assumption of
stable economic structures and an understanding of economic growth as a
continuous increase in the quantity of the goods that are
produced]{.underline}. Figure 11.1 depicts the impressive growth
performance of the German economy, where---in particular in the period
of the so-called Wirtschaftswunder after 1945---income per head
skyrocketed: at the beginning of the twenty-first century, per capita
GDP is approximately four times higher than three generations earlier.
But does this mean that German consumers today have four Volkswagen
Beatles in their garages? Obviously not! [Today we have completely
different goods and services in our consumption baskets, we acquire
different competences in universities, we work in different
jobs]{.underline}, etc. [Restricting]{.underline} economic [growth
analysis to a quantitative dimension only dismisses these most important
qualitative dimensions]{.underline}. [Such an analysis can only serve
for a very short-term observation]{.underline}.

The alternative approach of [neo-Schumpeterian economics]{.underline}
(e.g., Hanusch and Pyka 2007) [challenges this quantitative orientation
and instead emphasizes the importance of qualitative aspects, which make
fundamental changes of economic structures over longer periods
visible]{.underline}. [Without the consideration of the **qualitative
levels** of economic growth, the quantitative figures **cannot tell
much** about the massive technological and socioeconomic
developments]{.underline}. The neo-Schumpeterian approach highlights
that [innovations, market forces, structural change, and urban ways of
life are both part of the problem and part of the **solution** to the
sustainability problem]{.underline}. [Innovation-triggered development
generates both quantitative, i.e., income-increasing growth, and
qualitative, i.e., structure-changing development]{.underline}.
[**Only** the creative solutions characteristic for
**capitalistic-organized economies** will enable to reform our future
economy in the sense of sustainability]{.underline}, thereby supporting
the UN's sustainability goals and [simultaneously ensuring growth and
development]{.underline} (Mazzucato and Perez 2015).

The central role of innovation in neo-Schumpeterian economics highlights
that abstinence in the sense of [economic downscaling is neither the
first nor the only solution]{.underline}. This does not mean that all
ideas of the proponents of the camp are rejected: in perfect accordance,
certain past patterns like the high energy intensity of production
because of too low oil prices not covering the total environmental costs
or so-called planned obsolescence in consumption require urgent
adjustments. Especially concepts resulting in a more intensive use of
goods and therefore contributing to the economization of resources like
the sharing economy or displacing physical goods by digital goods are
promising. The same applies for closed-loop material cycles, recycling
systems, and intelligent waste avoidance and treatment. These concepts
are perfectly applicable to foster learning and behavioral changes on
the supply and the demand side. The core idea of neo-Schumpeterian
economics, however, is the [supply of and demand for new technological
solutions within a comprehensive economic transformation
process]{.underline} (Geels 2002), i.e., different goods and services
are produced and demanded in different, namely, sustainable ways.
Exploring and exploiting the technological possibilities of the
bioeconomy [not only creates new investment opportunities but is also
the **condition sine qua non** for the required socioeconomic and
cultural changes]{.underline}. [The consumers' acceptance of bio-based
products and their demand are indispensable for a successful
transformation]{.underline}. [Innovations and changed consumer attitudes
are complementary conditions for the creation of a sustainable
production system]{.underline}.

Change can be either of an incremental type in terms of small
improvements step-by-step along well-known technological trajectories,
or it can be fundamental, leading to structural changes and the
emergence of new and the disappearance of old industries. To simplify,
we assume in this chapter that incremental technological changes are
based on existing technological solutions, whereas radical technological
changes question major existing production processes. [They might lead
to **massive upheaval** in the global production system in the sense of
creative destruction]{.underline} (Schumpeter 1943). Because this
chapter deals with the fundamental transformation of current production
systems, [radical technological innovations are]{.underline} in the
spotlight which encompass the [overcoming of the lock-in situation in
fossil fuels]{.underline} (Unruh 2000) [and the establishment of a
**knowledge-based bioeconomy**]{.underline} (Pyka 2017; Pyka and
Buchmann 2016). Without doubt [this transformation process is radical,
qualitative, and long term]{.underline}. It was already in Business
Cycles, published in 1939, when Schumpeter revitalized Kondratieff's
theory of long waves in order to explain such processes as regular
processes in long-term economic development. His illustration of the
discontinuous nature of economic development is famous: "Add
successively as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a
railway thereby" (Schumpeter 1934, p. 64). So far, the literature
highlights five long waves: The beginning industrialization around the
year 1800 represented the first long wave and was fueled by the steam
engine and by cotton processing. Then, starting around the year 1850,
the widespread availability of steel and the diffusion of railways
constituted a second long wave. Again, in the early twentieth century,
this Kondratieff cycle was replaced by electricity and chemicals. In the
postwar period, the third long wave gained momentum by mass production
and the automobile as well as the petrochemical industries. Since then,
manufacturing activities built on oil as a second fossil fuel apart from
coal. From the 1980s, one refers to the fifth long wave, which is
reflected in the fast and ubiquitous diffusion and application of
information and communication technology. Now, [at the beginning of the
twenty-first century, another paradigmatic change is in the air, being
characterized]{.underline}, however, [by one major difference to
previous situations of radical change: whereas previous cycles were
driven by technological bottlenecks and their overcoming, in the
twentyfirst century, we face the vital question of how to restore
environmental sustainability of economic activities]{.underline}. The
knowledge-based bioeconomy plays a key role in this transformation
process which, of course, like previous radical changes, still is
confronted by fundamental uncertainty (Knight 1921).

The literature provides many alternative terms for the massive change,
shaking global production systems: Freeman (1991) and Dosi (1982) call
them techno-economic paradigm changes; Sahal (1985) uses cartographic
analogies and refers to technological guideposts that are pointing to
technological avenues. All authors highlight the confrontation with
profound changes economic systems are faced with over longer periods of
time, which question all established production approaches. [Not a
single technology is responsible for this phenomenon but several
complementary developments that include, apart from a package of
mutually dependent technologies]{.underline} (e.g., combustion engine,
petrochemistry, assembly line production), [numerous infrastructural
developments]{.underline} (e.g., road structure, filling station
network), [behavioral changes]{.underline} (e.g., suburbs and commuter
flow, shopping malls outside the city centers), [as well as
institutional changes]{.underline} (e.g., spatial planning and commuter
allowance, etc.). The old paradigm will not be replaced by the new one
until all these elements interact.

The neo-Schumpeterian approach provides us with crucial hints on the
process of the forthcoming change. For this purpose, we discuss in the
following section how innovations are supported by the discovery and
successful diffusion of new knowledge. [Knowledge-based economies
organize innovation systems composed of different actors which establish
a creative environment for mutual learning and knowledge
creation]{.underline}. [No innovation would have ever been established
if it had not attracted consumers' interest and if it had not been
leveraged by their purchasing power]{.underline}. We will focus on these
questions in Sect. 11.3. [Knowledge-based societies consider new
concepts in the sense of responsible innovation that are decisive in
bringing an entire economy on a new sustainable path-shaping growth and
development]{.underline}. Section 11.4 deals with the massive economic
impacts originating from these technological and knowledge-driven
changes. It requires, besides technological change, also institutional
change in a coevolutionary fashion, if new sustainable technologies are
to achieve the aspired transformation of the economic system.

11.2 Innovation Systems and Knowledge

Neo-Schumpeterian scholars (e.g., Dosi et al. 1988; Lundvall 1992, 1998;
Nelson 1993) strongly emphasize the systemic character of innovation
processes. So-called innovation systems are composed of different actors
(companies, research institutions, political actors, consumers, etc.)
and linkages between these actors (flows of goods, R&D cooperation,
knowledge transfer relationships, user-producer relationships, etc.).
These linkages are required to ensure mutual learning and common
knowledge development to solve complex innovation challenges. Such
systems are characterized by their dynamic and coevolutionary nature and
are thus enormously complex, as both actors and their knowledge and
linkages and interactions between actors may change over time.

Dosi (1982) takes this systemic conception as a starting point in
defining technological paradigms as "\[\...\] set of procedures, or a
definition of the 'relevant' problems and of the specific knowledge
related to their solution." [Transferred to the knowledge-based
bioeconomy, the core idea is substitution]{.underline}, i.e., [replacing
carbon-based materials and energy with bio-based materials and
energy]{.underline}. [This can only be achieved by applying a variety of
technological processes in the entire breadth and depth of the
value-added chain]{.underline}. In this process the exploration of
economic complementarities in terms of crossfertilization of different
knowledge fields matters. For example, to a large extent,
[digitalization allows for an extension of value chains by increasing
the added value in new sustainable production sectors in a **CO2-neutral
way**]{.underline} (e.g., by electric mobility based on renewables, by
establishing so-called smart grids, etc.). The concept of technological
paradigms also illustrates that a paradigm shift is not possible at any
time. A window of opportunity will only occasionally be opened and allow
for a paradigm shift when several interconnected technologies are
established and the creation of conducive demand side and institutional
conditions happens simultaneously. This, of course, also holds for the
emergence of a new bioeconomic innovation system and requires a sound
balance of the various actors and their activities. For this reason, we
introduce the notion of a dedicated innovation system.

The theory of industrial life cycles, which emphasizes the strong
dynamics in the emergence and decline of industries, gives a first hint
on the meaning of the development of a dedicated innovation system
supporting the transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.
Typically, industrial development is divided into four stages: (1) a
development phase (new knowledge creates prerequisites for innovation),
(2) an entrepreneurial and growth phase (many market entries of smaller
innovative firms), (3) a saturation and consolidation phase (formation
of industrial standards, mergers, and acquisitions as well as market
exits), and (4) a downturn phase (oligopolistic competition in only less
innovative industries) (e.g., Audretsch and Feldman 1996). Although the
bioeconomy does not represent a well-defined industrial sector,
understanding the theory of industrial life cycles is of crucial
importance to govern the transformation process towards the
knowledge-based bioeconomy. Without doubt, the bioeconomy has to be
characterized as cross sectional. On the one hand, several new sectors
will emerge, e.g., in the fields of bioplastic, waste management, or
biorefineries. On the other hand, already existing sectors in the fields
of vehicle construction, battery technology, pharmaceuticals, etc. will
gain new momentum by the arrival of bioeconomic approaches. Therefore,
we argue that [new sectors will emerge by establishing bioeconomic
technologies and development dynamics of some already existing
industries will receive new impetus at the same time]{.underline}.
[Adjustments of old and development of new institutions]{.underline}
(e.g., in Germany the Renewable Energy Act, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Trading Law, etc.), [adjustments of consumer habits, and the emergence
of new educational opportunities in terms of coevolution will accompany
these processes and establish the institutional, the industrial, and the
consumer pillars of a dedicated innovation system]{.underline}.

The patterns and nature of new businesses in the bioeconomy are thus
strongly influenced by national institutions and organizations (Casper
et al. 1999; Whitley 1999). Institutions are defined as "a set of rules,
formal or informal, that actors generally follow, whether for normative,
cognitive, or material reasons." "Organizations are durable entities
with formally recognized members, whose rules also contribute to the
institutions of the political economy" (North 1990; Hall and Soskice
2001). In this interplay between organizations and institutions, the
knowledge base of an economy is created by the education and research
system and represents one of the most important prerequisites for the
transformation towards a bioeconomic production system (Geels 2002).
This automatically relates to a high level of uncertainty in particular
concerning the required future competences. In this complex process,
numerous individual knowledge fields are potentially relevant for the
transformation and are already identified, e.g., synthetic chemistry,
process engineering, genetic engineering, food technology, or
informatics. It is decisive to understand the dynamics of these
knowledge fields and the possibilities of their recombination with other
knowledge fields and adequate actors in order to create an innovation
system. In many cases, linkages of different knowledge fields
(cross-fertilization) are responsible for the emergence of extensive
technological opportunities: for instance, a complete new industry,
bioinformatics, has been initiated by the fusion of two so far unrelated
knowledge fields, database technology and molecular biology. Because
linking different knowledge fields is highly uncertain, private actors
might not start and governmental innovation policies matter. Knowledge
about future potentials, therefore, is essential for supporting research
and innovation policies: the analysis of knowledge and network dynamics
allows for the identification of development trajectories showing
sectors requiring public attention and support concerning research and
development in order to close existing knowledge gaps and build bridges
between various knowledge domains (Burt 2004; Zaheer and Bell 2005).

11.3 Innovation in Knowledge-Based Societies

It has already been mentioned that also consumer knowledge plays an
important role for the development and establishment of sustainable
consumption patterns in a knowledge-based bioeconomy (Geels 2002).
Therefore, the analysis of the transformation process has to include the
interaction of technological development, demand, and acceptance of
innovative solutions as well as sociological variables. The latter
include education, age, income, and gender. All are important
explanatory factors determining attention and readiness to deal with
bioeconomic issues. A bioeconomic innovation will only be successful
when consumers accept it. The direction of the transformation process
is, comparable to the importance of the policy realm, determined by
consumers, i.e., an important question has to address consumers'
openness to the bioeconomy and its products.

Finally, (real and virtual) social networks matter for the establishment
of new consumption patterns. They can contribute significantly to a
diffusion of consumers' behavioral patterns and values (Robertson et al.
1996; Valente 1996; Nyblom et al. 2003; Deffuant et al. 2005). Recent
studies show that attitudes are substantial for the development of
social relationships and that, in turn, social relationships
considerably influence behavior and attitudes. In the field of renewable
energies, for example, the initiative of municipal utilities' customers
has led in many cases to a "green" orientation of regional power supply.
In some cases, citizens' networks finally transformed to investment
companies that are engaged in wind farms.

Critical issues are to be dealt with in democratic processes in order to
be widely accepted. Not everything that is technically possible is also
socially desirable. In the field of the bioeconomy, this may, for
instance, include the use of genetically modified organisms in
agriculture. In fact, these organisms promise efficiency advantages with
regard to the consumption of land and water, etc., but their long-term
health and environmental risks cannot be completely (as with any new
technology) anticipated. Accordingly, technological developments require
consumers' acceptance and thus depend on the level of education in an
economy. This raises the question of a society's openness towards
innovations that are fundamentally associated with uncertainty. The
concept of responsible innovation summarizes the future-oriented
organization of development and is currently discussed with a high
priority by European policy makers and institutions. A comprehensive
working definition has been developed by Von Schomberg (2011). He
describes responsible innovation as "a transparent, interactive process
by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to
each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability
and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable
products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and
technological advances in our society)." This means that innovations are
not exclusively evaluated by their economic efficiency, but different
aspects (e.g., consumer protection or ecological aspects; see Schlaile
et al. 2017) also matter and are to be evaluated. Discussions on
biofuels ("fuel vs. food") show that both a pure economic and a
one-dimensional ethical perspective are not sufficient. The quality of
these discussions depends on the discussants' mutual understanding which
in turn depends on the participants' level of knowledge.

Modern plant breeding and production of seeds are bioeconomy fields of
innovation in which issues of responsibility are discussed frequently
and controversially. German consumers are skeptical about interference
with the genome of food crops, but individual points of criticism remain
unclear. New breeding techniques introduced, e.g., genome editing,
enable scientists to selectively modify DNA strands of crop plants.
These techniques are considered innovative as they may allow breeding of
potentially efficient plants in fast and cheap ways. Species developed
this way hardly differ from those of conventional breeding. The Central
Advisory Committee for Biological Safety does not classify these
techniques as genetic engineering, especially because no new
combinations of genetic material are made. As the Genetic Engineering
Act does not explicitly address these techniques, legal clarification is
still necessary as to whether these techniques are classified as genetic
engineering at all. Dissemination potential and acceptance are
influenced by this result. Here again, the necessity to include
education and information policies becomes evident to support the
transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.

The concept of social innovation (e.g., Hanusch and Pyka 2013)
emphasizes the importance of active citizenship in innovation. Thus,
according to the understanding of the European Commission, this term
includes innovations that are social, both in relation to their
objective and their instruments. In particular, this includes
innovations referring to the development and the application of new
ideas (for products, services, and models), covering at the same time
social demand and creating new social relationships or collaborations.
The whole society should benefit and contribute to generate new impetus
for improvement. Social innovations can make a major contribution to
rural development and promote economic resilience in these regions by
strengthening cooperative behavior. Rural cooperatives (e.g., regional
producer and marketing associations, winegrowers' cooperatives, tourism
associations, etc.) can help to develop regional competitiveness
considering ecological and social aspects. As a consequence, within the
framework of a bioeconomy, rural regions that are notably affected by
the already imminent demographic change and subsequent depopulation
receive new opportunities for economic development.

11.4 The Economics of Change

The sections above illustrate that a transformation of the prevailing
economic system towards a bioeconomy is an extremely complex process.
Various different actors participating in different roles are
contributing different pieces of knowledge. In this process, innovative
adjustments in already existing industries as well as the emergence of
new and the disappearance of mature industries can be observed
simultaneously. In addition to the substitutive relations of new
bio-based industries to traditional oil-based industries, there are
numerous essential complementary relations giving further momentum for
the transformation process. First and foremost, there are the
possibilities and application fields of digitalization. Digitalization
allows to replace many oil-based products and energyintensive services
simply by bits and bytes. [Simultaneously, digitalization offers a wide
range of opportunities by coordinating decentralized and very detailed
bioeconomic technologies and processes such as energy production and
distribution]{.underline}. This affects the composition of individual
sectors where a coexistence of large diversified companies and small
highspecialized technology companies is a likely solution. Finally,
[digitalization also offers consumer platforms to efficiently organize
"sharing economy" approaches]{.underline}. Finally, successful knowledge
generation and diffusion of relevant bioeconomic knowledge depends on
dynamic innovation networks (Pyka 2002) in which different actors
jointly share and create new knowledge. The consumers, represented, for
example, by consumer associations or politics, will play a key role in
these innovation networks and will help to establish networks in early
stages of technology development.

[In a knowledge-based bioeconomy, investment and economic growth still
represent a crucial element for employment, international
competitiveness, and income generation]{.underline}. [The bioeconomy can
make important contributions to accelerate investments by providing new
investment opportunities generated by fundamental innovations and
thereby bringing currently available large quantities of liquidity to a
productive use]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [accelerates
the technological paradigm shift]{.underline} (Pe´rez 2010).

The time path of the transformation process represents another critical
component and has been explored only partially so far. On the one hand,
it is high time to reduce carbon-based production methods. On the other
hand, there will be frictions in the transformation process being
caused, for example, by a lack of specialists and required competences.
In this context, the so-called sailing ship effects (Howells 2002),
frequently observed with radical innovations, could be made of good use.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, when the existence of the
established sailing ship technology was threatened by the arrival of new
steam ships, shipbuilders---not having changed their technologies for
many decades, if not centuries---began to innovate again. Due to the
threat of innovative technologies, adjustment reactions in predecessor
technologies can be observed with the aim to prevent the ancient
technologies to be quickly replaced. Such adjustment reactions are, for
example, fuel-efficient combustion engines and hybrid technologies as a
reaction to the emergence of electric vehicles. These adjustments are
advantageous since they pursue the same environmental objectives (e.g.,
inner-city fine dust and noise reduction, etc.) and thus provide more
time to develop new technologies. Accordingly, the transformation
process will for longer periods of time feature a coexistence of
traditional and bio-based industries. Furthermore, it will be important
to concurrently steer the relevant innovation processes in traditional
technologies. This coexistence further increases complexity. At the same
time, innovation policy is given room for maneuver and yet
insufficiently developed technologies are prevented from being
introduced prematurely which might cause promising approaches to fail.

Distributional effects of the transformation process are important for
social acceptance. A bio-based economy on an industrial scale will
largely represent a knowledge-based economy. Consequently, additional
demand for highskilled workers arises whereas opportunities for
low-skilled workers decrease. This means a potential loss of jobs for
less skilled workers in traditional industrial production. But apart
from that, there will be demand for different goods and services whose
compensation potential with regard to added value and employment is
still unclear. Moreover, it remains open to what extent companies are
prepared for this transformation into the bioeconomy. Transformation
processes will lead to a devaluation of competences so far responsible
for economic success. How do established companies deal with the
so-called not-invented-here syndrome, overcome operational blindness,
and shape transformation processes actively in order to obtain added
value at their established locations?

From this follows that distributional effects have an important regional
dimension: does the bioeconomy strengthen divergence processes between
regions or does it help to achieve more convergence? The approach of
creating networks in the sense of the so-called smart specialization
principle (Foray et al. 2009), connecting regional strengths along
value-added chains in the best possible way, is promising but only
sparsely implemented so far. Thus, in general, polarization tendencies
leading to economic as well as political and cultural concentration of
power and resulting in strong center-periphery structures can be
avoided. But it still remains unclear, how strong and operational
meaningful politically induced networks are in comparison to
self-organized networks and how policy might exert influence. First
findings indicate signs of a potential disintegration of the networks
when political support is withdrawn (Green et al. 2013).

[Transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomic production system
is supposed to terminate the existing negative relations between
economic growth and environmental pollution, use of resources, climate
change, and energy consumption and to promote a sustainable
economy]{.underline}. The following questions are closely linked to the
basic uncertainty of innovation and cannot be answered ex ante: "which
contributions are to be made by individual sectors?," "what complex
feedbacks for national and international competitiveness are to be
expected?," and "do the so-called rebound effects possibly reduce or
even overcompensate the positive effects of the transformation?"
Institutional rules, such as a self-commitment of oil-producing
countries to reduce their outputs due to the declining demand caused by
bioeconomics, are a way to reduce these uncertainties, at least partly.
It remains necessary for the leading actors, companies, households, and
policy makers to refrain from optimization approaches and profit
maximization in this transformation process. The complexity and
uncertainty of this process requires the awareness of all actors to
experimental behavior (trial and error) which always also includes the
possibility of failure.

[The role that technology plays in reducing humanity's dependence on
nature explains this paradox]{.underline}. [Human
technologies]{.underline}, from those that first enabled agriculture to
replace hunting and gathering, to those that drive today's globalized
economy, [have made humans **less reliant** upon the many ecosystems
that once provided their only sustenance, even as those same ecosystems
have often been left deeply damaged]{.underline}.

[Despite frequent **assertions**]{.underline} starting in the 1970s [of
fundamental "limits to growth," there is still remarkably **little
evidence** that human population and economic expansion will outstrip
the capacity to grow food or procure critical material
resources]{.underline} in the foreseeable future.

[To the degree to which there are fixed physical boundaries to human
consumption, they are so theoretical as to be **functionally
irrelevant**]{.underline}. The amount of solar radiation that hits the
Earth, for instance, is ultimately finite but represents no meaningful
constraint upon human endeavors. Human [civilization can flourish
for]{.underline} centuries and [millennia on energy delivered from a
closed uranium or thorium fuel cycle, or from hydrogen-deuterium
fusion]{.underline}. [With proper management, humans are at **no risk**
of lacking sufficient agricultural land for food]{.underline}. Given
plentiful land and unlimited energy, [**substitutes** for other material
inputs to human well-being can easily be found if those inputs become
scarce or expensive]{.underline}.

[There remain]{.underline}, however, [serious long-term environmental
threats]{.underline} to human well-being, [such as anthropogenic climate
change]{.underline}, stratospheric [ozone depletion, and ocean
acidification]{.underline}. [While these risks are difficult to
quantify]{.underline}, the evidence is clear today that [they could
cause significant risk of catastrophic impacts on societies and
ecosystems]{.underline}. Even gradual, non-catastrophic outcomes
associated with these threats are likely to result in significant human
and economic costs as well as rising ecological losses.

[Much of the world's population still suffers from more-immediate local
environmental health risks]{.underline}. Indoor and outdoor [air
pollution continue to bring premature death and illness to millions
annually]{.underline}. [Water pollution and water-borne illness due to
pollution and degradation of watersheds cause similar
suffering.]{.underline}

[Even as human environmental impacts continue to grow in the aggregate,
a range of long-term trends are today driving **significant decoupling**
of human well-being from environmental impacts]{.underline}.

[Decoupling occurs in]{.underline} both [relative and absolute
terms]{.underline}. [Relative decoupling means that human environmental
impacts rise at a slower rate than overall economic growth]{.underline}.
Thus, [for each unit of economic output, less environmental impact
(e.g., deforestation, defaunation, pollution) results]{.underline}.
Overall impacts may still increase, just at a slower rate than would
otherwise be the case. [Absolute decoupling occurs when total
environmental impacts]{.underline} --- impacts in the aggregate ---
[peak and begin to decline, even as the economy continues to
grow.]{.underline}

[Decoupling can be driven by both technological and demographic trends
and usually results from a combination of the two]{.underline}.

[The growth rate of the human population has **already
peaked**]{.underline}. [Today's population growth rate is one percent
per year, down from its high point]{.underline} of 2.1 percent [in the
1970s]{.underline}. [Fertility rates in countries containing more than
half of the global population are now below replacement
level]{.underline}. [Population growth today is primarily driven by
longer life spans and lower infant mortality]{.underline}, not by rising
fertility rates. Given current trends, [it is very possible that the
size of the human population will peak this century and then start to
decline.]{.underline}

[Trends in population are inextricably linked to other demographic and
economic dynamics]{.underline}. For the first time in human history,
over half the global population lives in cities. By 2050, 70 percent are
expected to dwell in cities, a number that could rise to 80 percent or
more by the century's end. [Cities are characterized by both dense
populations and low fertility rates]{.underline}.

[Cities occupy just one to three percent of the Earth's surface and yet
are home to nearly four billion people]{.underline}. As such,
[**cities** both drive and symbolize the decoupling of humanity from
nature, performing]{.underline} far [better than rural economies in
providing efficiently for material needs while reducing environmental
impacts]{.underline}.

The growth of cities along with the economic and ecological benefits
that come with them are inseparable from improvements in agricultural
productivity. [As agriculture has become more land and labor efficient,
rural populations have left the countryside for the cities]{.underline}.
[Roughly half the US population worked the land in 1880. Today, less
than 2 percent does]{.underline}.

[As human lives have been liberated from hard agricultural labor,
enormous human resources have been freed up for other
endeavors]{.underline}. Cities, as people know them today, could not
exist without radical changes in farming. In contrast, modernization is
not possible in a subsistence agrarian economy.

These improvements have resulted not only in lower labor requirements
per unit of agricultural output but also in lower land requirements.
This is not a new trend: rising harvest yields have for millennia
reduced the amount of land required to feed the average person. The
average per-capita use of land today is vastly lower than it was 5,000
years ago, despite the fact that modern people enjoy a far richer diet.
[Thanks to **technological improvements** in agriculture, during the
half-century starting in the mid-1960s, the amount of land required for
growing crops and animal feed for the average person declined by
one-half]{.underline}.

[Agricultural intensification, along with the move away from the use of
wood as fuel, has allowed many parts of the world to experience **net
reforestation**]{.underline}. About [80 percent of New England is today
forested, compared with about 50 percent at the end of the 19th
century]{.underline}. Over the past 20 years, the amount of land
dedicated to production forest worldwide declined by 50 million
hectares, an area the size of France. the "forest transition" from net
deforestation to net reforestation seems to be as resilient a feature of
development as the demographic transition that reduces human birth rates
as poverty declines.

[Human use of many other resources is similarly peaking. The amount of
**water** needed for the average diet has declined by nearly 25 percent
over the past half-century]{.underline}. Nitrogen pollution continues to
cause eutrophication and large dead zones in places like the Gulf of
Mexico. While the total amount of **[nitrogen]{.underline}** pollution
is rising, the amount [used per unit of production has **declined
significantly** in developed nations]{.underline}.

Indeed, [in contradiction to the often-expressed fear of infinite growth
colliding with a finite planet, demand for many material goods may be
saturating as societies grow wealthier]{.underline}. [Meat
consumption]{.underline}, for instance, [has peaked]{.underline} in many
wealthy nations [and]{.underline} has [shifted away from beef toward
protein sources that are less land intensive]{.underline}.

[As demand for material goods is met, developed economies see higher
levels of spending directed to materially less-intensive service and
knowledge sectors, which account for an increasing share of economic
activity]{.underline}. [This dynamic might be even more pronounced in
today's developing economies, which may benefit from being late adopters

Policy simulations enable the seeking of Consensus

[**Games** are popular because]{.underline} historically [people seek
and enjoy the **tension of competition**, positive rivalry and the
procedural justice of impartiality in **safe**]{.underline} and
regulated **[environments]{.underline}**. As in games, [simulations
temporarily **remove** the participants from their **daily routines**,
**political pressures**, and the restrictions of **real-life**
protocols.]{.underline}

In consensus building, participants engage in extensive debate and need
to act on a shared set of meanings and beliefs to guide the policy
process in the desired direction, yet [**without sacrificing**
**critique** and **creativity**]{.underline}. During the joint
experimental actions of simulation, value debates become focused,
sharpened, and placed into operational contexts that allow participants
to negotiate value trade-offs. Participants work holistically, from the
perspective of the entire system, in order to reach a joint definition
of the problem. Most importantly, [role-playing takes the **attention
away** from the **individual**]{.underline} (Geurts et al. 2007). To
cite one case, [Geurts et al.]{.underline} (2007: 549) [note that the
'**impersonal** (in-role) **presentation** of some of the difficult
messages was a very **important factor** in the **success of the game**.
When people play roles, they defend a perspective, not their own
position: what they say in the game, they say because their role forces
them to do so']{.underline}. Consequently, [policy simulations make it
possible for participants to become (**safely**) caught up and to learn
**powerful lessons** from]{.underline} conflict-ridden [simulations
rather than from **conflict-ridden real-life**]{.underline} policy
processes (Geurts et al. 2007).

[Policy simulations promote **Commitment to action**]{.underline}

[When participants engage collaboratively in]{.underline} a
well-designed [policy simulation and work towards the assessment of
possible impacts of major decision alternatives, they tend to become
**involved**, **reassured** and **committed**. **However**,
participating in a simulation about **one's own organisation** or
professional arena can also be a **disquieting**
experience]{.underline}. The process of objectification that takes place
in a well-designed and [**well-run simulation** helps to reinforce
memory, stimulate doubt, raise issues, **disagreements** and **further
discussions**, and acts to control the delegation of
judgement]{.underline} (those who are affected can check the logic of
action). [Good simulations]{.underline} engage participants in the
exploration of possible futures and foster the power of 'exercises in
explicitness' to question and prevent unrealistic over- commitment to
one idea or course of action and [critically explore situations and
conditions where a chosen strategy **deviates**, **fails**, or
**backfires**.]{.underline}

Policy [**simulations** are, of course, not free from the problem of
**participant passivity**. **However**, a well-planned process of
participatory modelling, a **strictly balanced** distribution of
**tasks**, and **transparent activity** of all participants acts as a
safeguard against abstention from involvement]{.underline}. Good

Kent, Canterbury. \"Introduction to Special Issue: Decertifying Legal
Sex---Prefigurative Law Reform and the Future of Legal Gender.\"
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10691-022-09514-5\]

In her Afterword, Davies (2023) reflects on the plural temporalities
that decertification invokes. [Treating]{.underline} a **[contentious
legal proposal]{.underline}** [associated with the future as if it was a
**currently viable reform** is an **exercise** in prefigurative
**institutional experimentation**]{.underline}. [Prefiguration is a
helpful **framework** for thinking about **initiatives**]{.underline}
[that anticipate and embody hoped-for future possibilities]{.underline}
(see Monticelli 2022), [by enacting changes that are sought]{.underline}
(Yates 2015; Mensink 2020; see also Carroll et al. 2019). [Such a move
refuses the conventional political **division** between means and
ends]{.underline} (Van de Sande 2013; Swain 2019). [Against the notion
that **bad means** can be justified if they **secure good
ends**]{.underline}, [prefiguration treats the means as part of the ends
and, also, as **anticipating** them---since how politics is conducted
**shapes** the society it **gives rise to**]{.underline}. [Prefiguration
also treats desired ends as **operationalisable**]{.underline} [and as
doing stuff]{.underline}. [Rather than **await** a better society in the
**future**]{.underline} or rely on campaigning and political pressure to
induce more powerful forces to secure it, **[prefigurative
politics]{.underline}** [embodies hoped-for changes in the now.
Prefiguration has become a **popular** and **influential** framework
within anarchist and social movement circles]{.underline}. However, [the
critical orientation that many social movement activists and anarchists
adopt towards **state** and **law** means prefiguration's terms have
been little **utilised** in relation to them]{.underline}. [Yet, **state
and law** can be sites of **prefigurative practice**]{.underline},
[where hopeful practices]{.underline} (such as British local
government's 1980s introduction of nuclear free zones) [exceed what can
be realised]{.underline} (Cooper 2020). [Prefiguration may be carried
out, officially, **by state bodies**]{.underline}. It can also be
undertaken by actors, informally, within or in relation to state
apparatuses.

But what does it mean to formulate a prefigurative law reform proposal
within the course of research; and does it necessarily function as 'a
proposal'? Can a proposal not be proposed? Approaching decertification,
prefiguratively, emphasises its status as an experimental legal proposal
that imagines and rehearses future law, but this does not mean
decertification should be introduced in England and Wales today. We do
not argue, in this special issue, for decertification's implementation
as a contemporary law reform. Instead, we outline some legislative
principles for its future enactment mindful that these principles carry
the DNA of the geopolitical time of their imagining---namely, of early
2020s Britain, where views on different sides, and particularly the
hesitations and anxieties that decertification elicited, shaped the
legislative principles formed. These anxieties also provide reasons why
decertification may be a candidate for 'slow law' rather than something
to advance immediately in this jurisdiction as Cooper (2023b) explores
in her article.

This special issue focuses on the decertification of gender and sex, but
the [prefigurative]{.underline} [law reform methods]{.underline}
developed in the research discussed [have wider
reach]{.underline}---[being]{.underline} **[applicable]{.underline}**
[to many ideas for progressive **policy** and **legal reform** currently
identified as **too radical** for governmental
**attention**]{.underline}.Footnote12 [Some may characterise the
deliberate take up of]{.underline} **[speculative policy]{.underline}**
[reforms as a form of **play**]{.underline}---[a characterisation that
is often made **dismissively**]{.underline}. Play is a tricky
description given its association, for many, with light-heartedness,
frivolity, and messing about, where little or nothing is at stake. In
the context of decertification, the different stakes and investments in
gender-related law reform were sharply evident. At the same time, [play
has been used]{.underline}, in other contexts, [as a modality of
**action** that can be **serious** and]{.underline}
**[developmental]{.underline}** (see Statler et al. 2011[), and that can
have **consequences** beyond its '**magic circle'**]{.underline}. [What
play foregrounds, beyond **experimenting** and
**roleplaying**]{.underline} structures differently[, is a **testing**,
stretching, and knotting that pulls things into different]{.underline}
**[connections]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [relations with
others---and sometimes holds things apart]{.underline} (see Cooper
2019). Parliamentary **[law-making]{.underline}** [may rarely feel like
play]{.underline} (or, to the extent that it does, this is typically a
negative assessment). [But academic research can be a space where
experimental play]{.underline}---including [through]{.underline}
**[legislative design]{.underline}**---[imagines, rehearses, and takes
seriously **different futures**, free of the **pragmatism** and
**short-term political calculation** that dog proposals developed for
immediate introduction.]{.underline}

[In reaching]{.underline} out [to hoped-for **future
possibilities**]{.underline} [and retrieving them as **worthy**
recipients of present-day **attention**]{.underline}, [the involvement
of others is central]{.underline}. In the articles that follow, we
discuss some of the challenges of engaging stakeholders given the
polarised and increasingly bitter character of disputes over sex and
gender categories. However, [holding on to play is to hold on to an
important source of **invitation**]{.underline}. [This is about
something far more than being playful.]{.underline} It [is about
inviting **others to participate**]{.underline} [in the **testing** and
reshaping of **social relations**]{.underline}. Reimagining gender's
relationship to legal categories is not sufficient to bring them into
being. But it plays a part.

"The Consequentialist Perspective." In *Contemporary Debates in Moral
Theory*, Ed. James Dreier, Chapter 1, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2006,
pp. 15-19.

The Appeal of Consequentialism Although this essay abstains from
metaethical questions, I incline toward the view that [moral theories
are]{.underline} "[necessarily grounded in intuitions of truth or value
that cannot be objectively demonstrated or disproved]{.underline}"
(Hardin 1988: 179). At any rate, I know of no proof of consequentialism.
G. E. Moore once thought otherwise. In his famous work Principia Ethica
(1903), he argued that consequentialism is true by definition because
'morally right' simply means 'maximizes the good'. "The assertion 'I am
morally bound to perform this action,'" he wrote, "is identical with the
assertion 'This action will produce the greatest amount of good in the
Universe'" (p. 82). A few years later, however, Moore admitted that he
was mistaken, as indeed he was, to assert that these statements are
identical in meaning. Nevertheless, Moore continued to maintain that
[the two propositions 'morally right' and 'produces the most good' are
logically equivalent]{.underline} -- that there is a "necessary and
reciprocal connection" between them -- even though they are not
identical in meaning. Why? Moore's answer was simply that it is
self-evident "that [it must always be our duty to do what will produce
the best effects upon the whole]{.underline}" (1912: 100; 1952: 562--3).
[Too many reflective thinkers have rejected
consequentialism]{.underline} for a Moore-like assertion of
self-evidence to carry the day. But if this is so and [if]{.underline},
as I suspect, [ethical theories cannot be proved, then the question is
whether one finds the ethical ideas, values, or assumptions that inspire
consequentialism more attractive and convincing than those that guide
non-consequentialist approaches to ethics and whether one believes that
consequentialism provides the most coherent, systematic, and plausible
orientation to ethics that one is likely to find]{.underline}. As we
have seen, [consequentialists share the intuition that the morality of
our actions must be a function of the goodness or badness of their
outcomes]{.underline} and, more specifically, that [an action is right
if and only if it brings about the best outcome the agent could have
brought about]{.underline}. Consequentialists find it difficult to see
what the point of morality could be if it is not about acting in ways
that directly or indirectly bring about as much good as possible. True,
consequentialism may tell us not to guide ourselves directly by the
consequential standard of right in our day-to-day actions, but the
correctness of that basic standard has struck most thinkers in the
consequentialist tradition as obvious. How, they ask, could the
foundational principle of morality deem actions as morally right that
fail to maximize expected benefit? Acting so as to maximize benefit
strikes consequentialists as the essence of rationality. As John Stuart
Mill writes: Whether happiness be or be not the end to which [morality
should]{.underline} be referred -- that it [be referred to an end of
some sort, and not left in the dominion of vague feeling or inexplicable
internal conviction]{.underline}, that it be made a matter of reason and
calculation, and not merely of sentiment, [is essential to the very idea
of moral philosophy]{.underline}; is, in fact, what renders argument or
discussion on moral questions possible. That the [morality of actions
depends on the consequences which they tend to produce]{.underline}, is
the doctrine of rational persons of all schools; that the good or evil
of those consequences is measured solely by pleasure and pain, is all of
the doctrine of the school of utility, which is peculiar to it. (1838:
83) Consequentialism's goal-oriented, maximizing approach to ethics
coheres with what we implicitly believe to be rational conduct in other
contexts, in particular, when it comes to assessing prudential behavior.
[When seeking to advance our personal interests, we take for granted
that practical rationality requires us to weigh, balance, and make
tradeoffs among the things we seek in order to maximize the net amount
of good we obtain]{.underline}. [Only a consequentialist approach
tallies with that]{.underline}. The conviction that moral assessment
turns on consequences and that the promotion of what ultimately matters
ought to be the guiding principle of ethics lies at the heart of
consequentialism. Rival normative theories, of course, rely on other
moral assumptions and appeal to different considered moral judgments.
Compared to most non-consequentialist approaches, however,
[consequentialism requires a very small number of ethical
assumptions]{.underline}, and these yield, or so consequentialists
believe, a powerful but structurally simple normative theory, capable of
unifying our understanding of a diverse range of ethical phenomena. By
contrast, [non-consequentialist approaches to ethics]{.underline} (such
as the popular reflective equilibrium method of Rawls \[1971\] or the
common-sense pluralism of Ross \[1930\]) [typically have recourse to
intuition at an array of different points]{.underline}. In practice, the
result can be a hodgepodge of rules, principles, and injunctions of
varying degrees of generality. Moreover, the ethical assumptions on
which consequentialists rely are not only few in number, but also very
general in character, whereas non-consequentialist theorists typically
have recourse to various more specific lower-level intuitions,
concerning the legitimacy of particular rules or the moral necessity of
particular deontological permissions and restrictions. Intuitions about
the rightness or wrongness of specific types of conduct seem more likely
to be distorted by the authority of cultural tradition and the influence
of customary practice than are the more abstract, high-level intuitions
upon which consequentialism relies. Objections to Consequentialism
[Non-consequentialists believe]{.underline} either [that it
is]{.underline} sometimes [wrong to act so as to maximize expected
benefit]{.underline}, or that failing to so act is sometimes
permissible, or both. That is, they distinguish themselves from
consequentialists by affirming certain deontological restrictions or
embracing certain deontological permissions. Deontological restrictions
As mentioned earlier, the likelihood that a consequentialist theory will
require conduct that conflicts with the injunctions of ordinary
commonsense morality will depend on the particular value theory one
adopts. However, [even if consequentialists concede that unusual
circumstances could, in theory, make it right to perform an action that
people normally consider immoral]{.underline}, our earlier discussion
should have made it clear that in practice [the priority
consequentialists give to promoting rules, motives, and dispositions
that typically produce good results implies that they will endorse most
of the deontological restrictions of everyday morality because doing so
maximizes expected benefit]{.underline}. Even if a consequentialist
theory entailed that in the abstract it could be right, if the
circumstances were bizarre enough, to do something that would normally
be judged morally despicable, like, say, torturing an innocent child, in
practice it will make for a much better world if people's characters are
such that they would never even entertain the idea of torturing a child,
regardless of the circumstances. True, [if placed in the imaginary world
where torturing the child maximizes good, such people will do the wrong
thing]{.underline} (as judged [by the consequentialist
standard]{.underline}) [by refraining from torturing the
child]{.underline}. [But the real world in which we live is certainly
better the more widespread the inhibition on harming children is and the
more deeply entrenched it is in people's psychology]{.underline}.
[Consequentialists prefer people to have the moral motivations that
bring the best results in the everyday world, even if these motivations
might lead them to behave suboptimally in fanciful
situations]{.underline}. To this, non-consequentialists often reply that
the consequentialist gets the right answer but for the wrong reason.
Consequentialists, it is alleged, overlook the intrinsic wrongness of
torturing. But [consequentialists can explain perfectly well why torture
is evil]{.underline}. And unless the non-consequentialist is an
absolutist, he cannot say that torturing an innocent child is always
wrong. [What if doing so was the only way to stop a war of
aggression]{.underline}? So, [the non-consequentialist is reduced to
saying that the consequentialist takes the possibility of torturing the
child too lightly or is too ready to do it]{.underline}. [But these
allegations seem specious]{.underline}. In fact, non-consequentialism's
commitment to deontological restrictions is vulnerable to
consequentialist counterattack. The non-consequentialist sees it as an
important fact about our moral lives that an action can sometimes be
wrong even though its outcome would be better than that of all
alternative actions. Now [suppose]{.underline} that somehow your
[violating a certain deontological restriction]{.underline} (call it R)
[would result in there being fewer violations]{.underline} of R
[overall]{.underline}. [According to the deontologist, it would still be
wrong]{.underline} for you to violate R. [This is puzzling]{.underline},
and it is natural to ask: "If nonviolation of R is so important,
shouldn't that be the goal? How can a concern for the non-violation of R
lead to the refusal to violate R when this would prevent more extensive
violations of R?" (Nozick 1974: 30 \[slightly modified\]). Admittedly,
these are abstract questions, but [one can imagine circumstances in
which only by telling a lie]{.underline} (breaking a promise, killing an
innocent person) [can one prevent several other people from telling
lies]{.underline} (breaking promises, killing innocent people). Faced
with such situations, deontological theories will, at least sometimes,
forbid an action of a certain type even when performing it would result
in fewer actions of the forbidden type. This point does not presuppose
that the deontologist is an absolutist. Even a moderate
non-consequentialist endorses restrictions that it would be wrong for
one to violate, at least in some circumstances, even though one's doing
so would minimize violations of the very same restriction. This fact
leads consequentialists to argue that [deontological restrictions are
paradoxical or even irrational]{.underline}. For how can a normative
theory plausibly say that it is wrong to act so as to decrease immoral
conduct (that is, conduct that the theory itself identifies as immoral)?
It seems illogical for a theory to forbid the performance of a morally
objectionable act when doing so would reduce the total number of such
actions and would have no other relevant consequences. [In practice
consequentialists are likely to endorse many of the restrictions that
deontologists insist upon]{.underline}. But these restrictions will be
part of the moral code that consequentialists uphold in order to promote
the good in the most effective way they can. However strongly agents are
encouraged to adhere to these rules and to internalize a commitment to
them, these restrictions are not, for the consequentialist,
foundational, but derive from a more basic principle of morality.
Deontological permissions Critics of consequentialism claim that it sets
too high a standard and demands too much of us. Their argument goes like
this. At many points in our day, when we are innocently relaxing,
talking with friends, or simply at work doing our jobs, we could
probably be doing something else instead that would create more good.
Instead of watching television tonight, we could visit a nursing home to
chat and play cards with its elderly residents. Instead of going to the
beach with friends, we could work with the homeless. Instead of buying a
new car, we could make do with our old one and give the rest of the
money to charity. And so on: our lives are rarely so productive of good
that it would be impossible for us to do more. In principle, or so the
critics contend, consequentialism could require us to sacrifice our most
basic interests in the name of the general good. Because I have
discussed this matter elsewhere (Shaw 1999: 129--32, 261--87) and
because Alastair Norcross takes it up in his contribution to this volume
(see chapter 3), I will be brief. [How much sacrifice consequentialism
demands of us will]{.underline}, again, [depend on the values the
consequentialist wants to see maximized]{.underline}. We must bear in
mind the good that (on almost any plausible value theory) is likely to
come from permitting people to pursue, as much as possible, their own
goals and plans, as well as the possibility that it may bring better
results "for a man to aim rather at goods affecting himself and those in
whom he has a strong personal interest, than to attempt a more extended
beneficence" (Moore 1903: 166--7). Suppose, however, that when conjoined
with our most plausible theory of good, consequentialism entails that
morality demands much, much more of us than people ordinarily think. It
doesn't follow from this that consequentialism is mistaken. Intuitions
about these matters, in particular, intuitions about how much effort,
time, or money morality obliges us to give to assist those who need our
assistance, are an unreliable foundation for normative theorizing
because those intuitions reflect social expectations and customary
practice in a socioeconomic system, the norms of which are themselves
open to assessment.

I do not, however, think that **[the revolutionary road
is]{.underline}** implausible. Rather, it is
**[impossible]{.underline}**, at least **[inside the rich capitalist
democracies]{.underline}**. **[And between the implausible and the
impossible the choice is clear.]{.underline}** Again, **[this can be
framed as an empirical hypothesis]{.underline}**: **[You do not see
revolutions in developed capitalist democracies]{.underline}**. As
Przeworski and Limongi (1997) have written, **[there has never been a
revolution in a moderately middle-class democracy]{.underline}** (see
also Przeworski, 2019). **[Drawing on a thousand years of
data]{.underline}**, cumulatively collected across 37 democratic
countries, **[they show that not one had collapsed with a per-capita GDP
higher than that of Argentina in 1976. A]{.underline}**mong countries
with half that figure, collapse was exceedingly rare. Even a modest GDP
brings with it an enormous amount of regime stability. **[These data in
fact include any kind of regime collapse;]{.underline}** **[narrowing
the data to socialist revolution makes the empirical case against it
even more impressive.]{.underline}** Any case for revolution must begin
by acknowledging rather than ignoring this evidence. To look at this
question in a different way, I draw on the Cross-National Time-Series
Data Archive, which contains information on revolutions (rather than
government collapse) for over 200 countries since 1919. **[Their
definition of revolution is very broad]{.underline}** (see footnote 7)
**[and includes "attempts" to overthrow government as well as
"unsuccessful" rebellions]{.underline}**. The data were compiled from
newspaper sources and warrants caution, but nonetheless constitutes the
most systematic evidence available for these questions. In Figure 9, I
present the GNP per capita distribution of revolutions, from 1919, where
GNP is first available, to the present. By considering only those
country-years with revolutions I reduce the observation count from
17,520 to 184. Unlike Przeworski, I do not further restrict the data to
democracies. The graph displays an extreme skew: The vast, overwhelming
majority of cases of revolutionary threat occur in countries with a per
capita GNP below \$5,000 USD. For reference, the figure for the US in
the data is about \$65,850 in 2019. The hypothesis above---that we do
not see revolutions in developed democracies---seems borne out by the
evidence. figure Figure 9. Histogram of country-years with revolutions.
Source: Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Data drawn from 200
plus countries between 1919 and 2018 are then restricted to
country-years (N = 184) in which there were "revolutions," as well as a
"major government crisis" and "anti-government protests." Why exactly is
this true and what are the mechanisms to explain it? Why is the
revolutionary strategy impossible for a country like the US? There are,
at bottom, three reasons, each of which stands alone as a sufficient
condition to snap the last threads of one's revolutionary faith.23 The
first two suggest that revolution is unachievable, and the last suggests
that even if it is achievable, socialism by revolutionary means is
unachievable. **[The revolutionary road is closed on the following
grounds:]{.underline}** (1) **[Workers do not want it]{.underline}**
(2) **[Capitalists would sooner grant reforms]{.underline}** (3) **[A
smashed state is more likely to result in tyranny]{.underline}** than
deep democracy **[Not only has there never been a successful revolution
in a developed democracy, there has never been a working class that has
wanted one]{.underline}** (e.g. Erikson and Tedin, 2015; Sassoon,
1996).24 There are no clear cases where the dominant inclination of the
working class in a developed democracy was revolutionary. Recall that
the above graph also includes attempts and unsuccessful cases. It is
self-evident that workers have not joined revolutionary groups en masse
at any point in the context of a rich democracy. Nor were their
aspirations to join such groups thwarted by violence or ideology. When
gains inside a capitalist democracy are available---either individual or
collective ones, and this has been true even through the neoliberal
period, where median living standards have continued to (slowly) go up
and not down---it is not worth risking everything for an uncertain
future (Thewissen et al., 2015).25 More important than the dynamic point
is the static one: When standards of living are moderately high, as
shown in Figure 9, the modal worker has more to lose than her chains.
This is not an argument against socialism; but to revise Werner Sombart,
the life raft of revolution really was shipwrecked on shoals of roast
beef and apple pie. Therefore**[, the reasons workers are not
revolutionary are materialist in character. Explaining their reformist
politics does not require appeal to venal trade union leaders or false
consciousness. Most people wish to minimize risk in their lives, and
revolution involves taking on colossal risks.]{.underline}** For
example, **[home-ownership in the developed world hovers around 70%;
this means that a lot of people have a lot to lose.]{.underline}** By
contrast, **[the materialist case for revolution proposes that people
favor it when their expected post-revolutionary standards of living are
greater than their current standard]{.underline}** (Roemer, 1985). But
**[when we add moderate risk- and loss-aversion the calculation
changes]{.underline}** (Kahneman and Tversky, 1991). Say you have a low
income, but own a few assets, maybe a house, a car, and perhaps you also
have a child; what risk profile would you require to gamble your modest
holdings for an uncertain future which might be better but might be
worse? Even if you are certain that the probability of better is greater
than the probability of worse, you have to envision workers as a class
of inveterate gamblers to take the bet. Moderately cautious people who
prefer a bird in the hand will still view the downside risk as too
great. Equal gains and losses are not experienced equally. This is the
loss aversion phenomenon. But the assumption of a population confident
about improved standards of living---and a willingness to take risky
strategies to achieve them---is itself unwarranted. This is the risk
aversion phenomenon. The modal worker is of course correct to suspect
that her post-revolutionary welfare is uncertain; socialists after all
do not have satisfactory answers to the problems of coordination,
motivation, and innovation under socialism (for attempted answers that
are provocative and oftentimes brilliant, see Albert, 2004; Cottrell and
Cockshott, 1992; Corneo, 2017; Roemer, 1994; and Wright and Hahnel,
2016). When one compares the status quo to a future where both heaven
and hell are seemingly plausible, it is perfectly rational that people
everywhere would abandon the barricades. And abandon them they did. Now
perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative outcomes are
far-fetched, that we are very confident that revolution will usher in,
eventually, the land of milk and honey. It is still the case that in
this model the promised land will only be reached after a social
breakdown of unknown duration: A complete overhaul in the organization
of production will lead to some middle period of deteriorating material
welfare as capitalists rapidly exit the economy. This means chaos and
uncertainty, but it could also mean war. The interregnum could last a
year, but it might last two decades, and however optimistic we are about
the end point, we cannot in advance know how long this interim phase
will persist. In the meantime, revolutionary enthusiasm will wane,
erstwhile supporters will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy
will be outflanked by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy,
and the desire to consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse
greater. From a materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through
what Przeworski (1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey
less appealing.26 To my mind, these factors explain why **[all working
classes in all developed democracies have been decidedly reformist in
orientation]{.underline}**. **[The reason why revolutionary socialism
has always been marginal in rich capitalist
economies]{.underline}**---and will always be outflanked by
reform-oriented socialism---**[is that only the latter consistently
deliver hi]{.underline}**gh (and usually increasing) standards of living
and low (and usually decreasing) levels of risk. As long as the Mad Max
world of catastrophic collapse can be avoided, reform-oriented parties
will always better capture the enthusiasm of poor and working people.
Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.
This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: **[Revolution is
only possible when the forces of production are underdeveloped, but it
can only be successful when they are sufficiently developed to make
socialism]{.underline}** (or communism) **[objectively
viable]{.underline}**.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, **[the
circumstances under which revolutions spark and succeed never
coincide.]{.underline}** What about the **[capitalists]{.underline}**?
Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that they **[will
fight far harder against a revolution than they would against reformist
drives]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[ignoring the response from capitalists
violates Elster's first law of political rationality: Never assume your
opponent is less rational than you. If revolution were the
alternative]{.underline}**, **[employers would grant every imaginable
reform]{.underline}**, from far higher taxes to the rejiggering of power
relations in the workplace. In a mugging, most people will surrender
their wallet before their life. Actors in the state ought to respond in
more or less the same way---that is, as long as you admit your adversary
the competence to read the situation as well as you. If our theory of
the state suggests that it acts on behalf of the capitalist class, its
apparatchiks would anticipate and preempt any revolutionary crusade with
a cocktail of concession and repression. And while it will certainly
contest reforms, it will devote all of its resources to break the
revolution. Nonetheless, this means that revolutionaries can play a
crucial role, even if it is not to foment revolution. Militancy is a
powerful strategy to foment reform (for an argument about the history of
social democracy along these lines, see Piketty, 2014). Thus far, the
main reason revolution is off the table is because no one wants it---not
workers, nor employers, nor the state. The third point above asks us to
imagine the prospects for revolutionary success even if we ignore the
wrinkle that workers have neither an interest nor capacity to make it.
But let us pretend they did: **[Why]{.underline}** then would **[we
imagine that total social breakdown would prompt a deepening of
democracy]{.underline}** **[rather than authoritarian
entrenchment]{.underline}**? **[This happy outcome has never before
emerged in the wake of social collapse,]{.underline}** and there is
little reason why the final showdown with the American military ought to
produce fertile ground for deepening democracy in all spheres of life.
In fact, evidence from the General Social Survey suggests that in
response to recession and economic downturn people tend to become less
altruistic and less concerned with questions of fairness.28 After
situations of economic crisis, voters tend to shift to the right
(Lindvall, 2014). The old union song cries out that "we can bring to
birth a new world from the ashes of the old," but life is not birthed on
ash. None of the historical case studies track this narrative, and
indeed everything we know about human psychology suggests that social
devastation makes people more, not less, prone to demagoguery. This
means that even if a revolution were achievable, it is probably
undesirable. The argument I have thus far laid out against revolution
contends only that it is off the table in middle-class democracies. I
have in mind social dynamics within developed capitalist democracies,
countries "like the US," but the premise no longer holds true if we
imagine a society that has already suffered some sort of catastrophic
societal disintegration---at that point all bets are off. We are of
course now talking about a world we are not living in, but it is worth
considering the thought experiment nonetheless. It is possible that
America, after some world-historic environmental or economic collapse,
begins to look something more like Russian feudalism than contemporary
developed capitalism. Revolution then might again be on the table, but
the context of desperation and scarcity in this scenario gives little
reason to expect it would incubate an egalitarian democratic society.
The historical evidence is unambiguous: None of the communist
revolutions of the 20th century ushered in deeply democratic egalitarian
social structures. Not only are there no examples, but there are also no
clear mechanisms on offer. The fact that this scenario generates an
interest in bringing about an egalitarian society by means of revolution
does not mean there will be a capacity to do so. The theory is little
more than "where there is a will there is a way." But, as Elster (1980:
124) argues, the general interests of society do not secrete the
conditions for their fulfillment. Interests and capacities need not
overlap. There is a final reason to be skeptical of non-evolutionary
strategies: The highly dubious premise that the system we erect the
morning after will actually work. **[A socialist economy]{.underline}**,
if plopped down tomorrow, **[would be so rife with unintended
consequences]{.underline}** and pathologies that **[it is easy to
imagine a democracy voting its way back into capitalism]{.underline}**.
**[This is true even if we believe]{.underline}** (mistakenly, in my
view) **[that the socialist calculation debate is solvable in the age of
big data]{.underline}** (Morozov, 2019). Interlocutors in the
calculation debate have had very little to say about the politics of
transition. Indeed, **[it is hard to imagine success]{.underline}** of
any kind **[without a slow and incremental
transformation]{.underline}**, **[experimenting with bits and pieces
along the way]{.underline}**---as we have been doing for the past
century**[. An experimental approach is likely the only way to avoid
devastating blunders that undermine the whole project]{.underline}**.
**[Moments of institutional upheaval and big change may at times be
necessary, but to be successful they will have to rest on a foundation
of smaller changes that have been tested.]{.underline}**

[Using]{.underline} the fact that Israeli kibbutzim experienced
[economic crises]{.underline} of varying severity as a quasinatural
experiment, [we study the]{.underline} political and economic
implications [of]{.underline} economic [crises in a
**socialist**]{.underline} and democratic [system. We find]{.underline}
that [people]{.underline} in kibbutzim [who experienced]{.underline} a
more severe [crisis shifted **rightward** in their voting]{.underline}
in national elections [and]{.underline} that [this effect **persisted**
for]{.underline} more than [**two decades** after the crisis was
over]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} electoral [transition was rooted in a **move away**
from socialist ideology **toward**]{.underline} supporting [the
**free-market**]{.underline} system. [Using surveys that
elicited]{.underline} the economic and political [attitudes of
**thousands**]{.underline} of kibbutz members, we [find]{.underline}
that [members]{.underline} of kibbutzim that experienced more severe
economic crises increased support for the liberalization of labor
markets and [**reduced** support for socialism and that this shift
persisted]{.underline} long after the economic crisis was resolved. [The
crisis had]{.underline} an [**especially** long-lasting effect on
**adolescents**]{.underline} and young adults. Taken together, our
results are consistent with economic downfalls triggering resentment
toward the prevailing economic system, which persist in the long run,
especially among the young. Exploiting our unique settings, we also
study the recovery from the crisis. First, while the crisis changed
trust and economic attitudes, a debt relief arrangement partly reversed
the effect. Following the signing of the arrangement, trust in
leadership was restored, indicating that sound policy can help leaders
regain trust. However, economic perceptions were less amendable to this
development. [The **end** of the crisis **did not** restore belief in
socialism]{.underline}.

[Our findings contribute to a **generalized understanding** of economic
crises]{.underline}, suggesting that instead of universally pushing
people leftward, they [ignite **opposition**]{.underline} to the
prevailing system. Our study also brings a unique perspective on
developing socialist systems in the face of crises and market
liberalization. As obtaining reliable political data in socialist
regimes is difficult, our study offers a unique glimpse to underlying
mechanisms linking economic downturns to shifts from socialism to
capitalism. We present [ev]{.underline}idence that [suggests socialism
**erodes** in response to a decrease in **public support**]{.underline}.
Lastly, our results are informative to various communal societies that
existed throughout history and, at times, played a pivotal role in their
nation's economic and political systems.

## Impact Turns 

#### Turn:Transition wars are [likely]{.underline}.

Tim **Krieger &** Daniel **Meierrieks 24**. Wilfried Guth Professor of
Constitutional Political Economy and Competition Policy at the
University of Freiburg, PhD in economics from the University of Munich.
Senior Researcher with the Department for Migration, Integration and
Transnationalization at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, PhD in
economics from the University of Paderborn. *Handbook of Research on
Economic Freedom*. Edward Elgar Publishing. 360-363.

First, economic freedom is associated with the freedom to
**[trade]{.underline}** internationally as well as the promotion of
economic exchange within a country (e.g., by removing regulations that
would complicate internal trade and exchange). Consequently, economic
freedom [creates]{.underline} economic
**[interdependencies]{.underline}** between people and regions (i.e.,
domestically) as well as between countries (i.e., internationally).
These interdependencies, in turn, ought [to **disincentivize
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in a world of economic
interdependencies, [economic bonds could be **destroyed** in a war,
making peace]{.underline} and war [a matter of **cost-benefit
calculus**]{.underline}, with the destroyed bonds constituting a high
cost for any expected utility-maximizing government (Schneider 2010). In
a similar vein, while economic freedom may allow for the substitution of
trading partners, potentially reducing bilateral interdependencies, thus
making conflict more likely (Martin et al. 2008),
**[multilateral]{.underline}** economic [interdependencies]{.underline}
within a globalized world (as facilitated by economic freedom) may
[lead]{.underline} economically invested [**third parties** to
show]{.underline} their [disapproval of]{.underline} bilateral
[conflict]{.underline} by sending trade-based signals of resolve (Kinne
2014). This holds not only for interstate war but also for internal war,
which some trading partners may aim to stop through, for example,
interventions (Bussmann and Schneider 2007; Powell and Chacha 2016).

Second, [economic freedom is]{.underline} also [linked to]{.underline}
low levels of taxation and [small government]{.underline} (e.g.,
measured as government expenditure as a share of total GDP).
[If]{.underline} potential [participants]{.underline} of conflict [are
motivated]{.underline} by a desire [to **capture rents**, a smaller
government constitutes a **smaller prize**]{.underline} that would have
to be compared with the payoff from non-violence. Consequently, for
example, as shown in Kirk's (1983) model, [smaller
governments]{.underline} (as a consequence of economic freedom) are
expected to [see **less conflict**]{.underline} compared with larger
governments (where the prize of conflict is comparatively larger).

Third, economic freedom may be conducive to economic growth and
**[development]{.underline}**, e.g., as higher levels of economic
freedom [coincide with stronger property rights]{.underline}; stronger
[property rights]{.underline}, in turn, [incentivize
innovation]{.underline} and thus, ultimately, productivity gains and
economic development (see de Haan and Sturm 2024 in this volume).
Similarly, Vadlamannati and de Soysa (2014) argue that sound legal
institutions that safeguard [profits create incentives for investment
into]{.underline} (**[civilian]{.underline}**) [production, making
this]{.underline} type of investment [**more attractive**
than]{.underline} investment into [warfare]{.underline}. As a final
example, [economic freedom may]{.underline} help to
[channel]{.underline} the struggle caused by incompatible (economic)
goals into a [competition]{.underline} for [but not]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} over mobile financial, physical or human capital;
here, economic exchange acts as a signaling and communication device
(O'Neal and Russett 1999; Gartzke et al. 2001). Mobile capital, in turn,
is an important input for economic growth and development (e.g.,
Grossman and Helpman 1993). For instance, Gartzke (2005, p. 32)
di\\scusses how economic freedom interacts with international factor
mobility:

> Economic freedom means you can take \[your wealth\] with you. When
> conditions get bad domestically, capital can leave the country,
> creating an economic, and thus political, drain on the society.
> Obviously, governments do not want money to leave. To the degree that
> sovereigns are unable to stop the flight of capital, however, they
> must create conditions that favor the voluntary retention of money
> within their borders.

By fostering **[economic success]{.underline}**, higher levels of
economic freedom [could]{.underline} thus [make it less
likely]{.underline} that potentially violent [actors will
have]{.underline} to engage in conflict to satisfy their
**[greed]{.underline}** for resources or accommodate their economic
grievances, [given]{.underline} that [more resources will be
available]{.underline} to them [through]{.underline} the marketplace in
the process of economic **[development]{.underline}**. The basic
underlying assumption here is that the probability of an internal and
international war to occur is a decreasing function of per capita income
(e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998; Schneider 2010).

[The US]{.underline} now [has a president who regularly
uses]{.underline} his [Twitter]{.underline} account [to heap invective
on]{.underline} leaders of [nuclear-armed states, the]{.underline}
American news [media]{.underline}, members of his own cabinet, [and
religious and racial minorities, while showering praise on those who
traduce the values of democracy]{.underline}, tolerance, and
international law.

[Countries such as China, Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are more
authoritarian, more nationalist, and more truculent on the world stage
than]{.underline} they were [a year ago]{.underline}. And [then there
is]{.underline} the surely more belligerent and possibly more erratic
leader of [North Korea, a country on the brink of developing the ability
to deliver nuclear weapons at long range]{.underline}.

[Europe]{.underline} also [faced trials]{.underline} in 2017. Aside from
the United Kingdom's decision to proceed with its withdrawal from the
European Union, [the far right won seats in the German Bundestag for the
first time in decades, and far-right parties]{.underline} and candidates
[did better]{.underline} than ever [in a number of European
elections]{.underline}. In mid-November, 60,000 people marched through
Warsaw demanding a "White Europe."

So [there is plenty of passionate intensity. And much of it is directed
at the traditions]{.underline} and understandings [that]{.underline}
have [made the last several decades the best in human
history]{.underline}, in terms of living standards, human emancipation,
scientific and artistic progress, reduction in pain and suffering, or
minimization of premature and violent death.

[Will things stay together? Can some]{.underline} kind of [center
hold?]{.underline} Financial markets offer a remarkably optimistic view.
The US stock market has broken one record after another in the year
since Donald Trump's election as president, while indicators of realized
stock-market volatility and of expected future volatility are at very
low levels by historical standards. And some stock markets around the
world have done even better.

While high equity prices and low volatility may seem surprising, they
likely reflect the limited extent to which stock-market outcomes and
geopolitical events are correlated. For example, Japan's attack on Pearl
Harbor, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the 9/11
terrorist attacks had no sustained impact on the economy. The largest
stock-market movements, such as the 1987 crash, have typically occurred
on days when there was no major external news.

Stock markets are buoyant because they comprise individual companies,
and, to a remarkable extent this year, corporate profits have been both
rising and predictable. How long this will last is difficult to judge,
and there is a risk that investors are increasingly taking on leverage
or pursuing strategies -- such as contemporary versions of portfolio
insurance -- that will cause them to sell if markets decline. It is
worth remembering that, looking back, markets do not appear to have been
remarkably bubbly prior to the 1987 crash.

[There is]{.underline} also [the question of financial institutions'
health]{.underline}. While major firms appear far better capitalized and
far more liquid than they were prior to the crisis, [market indicators
of risk suggest we may not be quite as far out of the woods as many
suppose. Despite apparently large increases in capital and consequent
declines in leverage, it does not appear that bank stocks have become
far less volatile]{.underline}, as financial theory would predict if
capital had become abundant.

Financial markets are widely cited, including by US President Donald
Trump, as providing comfort in the current moment. But [a relapse into
financial crisis would likely have **catastrophic**]{.underline}
political [**consequences**, sweeping into power even more **toxic
populist nationalists**. In such a scenario, the center **will not
hold**]{.underline}.

Beyond the kind of near-term risks that markets price, [there is the
question of an economic downturn]{.underline}. The good news is that
sentiment is positive in most of the world. Inflation seems unlikely to
accelerate out of control and force a lurch toward contractionary fiscal
and monetary policies. Most forecasters regard the near-term risk of
recession as low.

But [recessions are never predicted successfully, even six months in
advance. The current expansion in the US has gone on for a long time,
and the risk of policy mistakes]{.underline} there [is]{.underline} very
[real]{.underline}, owing to highly problematic economic leadership in
the Trump administration. I would put the annual probability of
recession in the coming years at 20-25%. So the odds are better than
even that the US economy will fall into recession in the next three
years.

[The risk from a purely economic point of view is that the traditional
strategy for battling recession]{.underline} -- a reduction of 500 basis
points in the federal funds rate -- [will be unavailable this year,
given the zero lower bound on interest rates. Nor is it clear that the
will or the room for fiscal expansion will exist]{.underline}.

[This means that the next recession]{.underline}, like the last, [may
well be **protracted and deep**, with **severe** global consequences.
And the political capacity for a global response, like that on display
at the]{.underline} London [G-20 Summit in 2009, appears to be
**absent**]{.underline} as well. Just compare the global visions of US
President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown back then with
those of Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May today.

I shudder to think what a serious recession will mean for politics and
policy. [It is hard to imagine avoiding a resurgence of **protectionism,
populism, and scapegoating**]{.underline}. In such a scenario, as with
another financial crisis, the center will not hold.

But [the greatest risk]{.underline} in the next few years, I believe, is
neither a market meltdown nor a recession. It [is]{.underline} instead
[a **political doom loop** in which voters' conclusion that government
does not work effectively for them becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Candidates elected on platforms of resentment delegitimize the
governments they lead, fueling further resentment and even more
problematic new leaders. Cynicism pervades]{.underline}.

How else can one explain how the candidacy of Roy Moore for a US Senate
seat? Moore, who was twice dismissed for cause from his post on the
Alabama Supreme Court, and who is credibly charged with sexually
assaulting teenage girls when he was in his 30s, could enter the US
Senate as many of his colleagues look the other way.

[If a country's citizens lose confidence in their government's ability
to improve their lives, the government has an incentive to **rally
popular support** by focusing attention on threats]{.underline} that
only it can address. [That is why in societies pervaded by anger and
uncertainty about the future, the temptation to stigmatize minority
groups increases. And it is why there is a tendency]{.underline} for
officials [to **magnify foreign threats**]{.underline}.

[We are seeing this]{.underline} phenomenon [all over the
world]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline},
Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan, and]{.underline} Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [have all made nationalism a central
part of their governing strategy. So]{.underline}, too, [has Trump, who
has]{.underline} explicitly [rejected]{.underline} the international
[community in favor of the idea that there is only a ceaseless struggle
among nation-states]{.underline} for competitive advantage.

When the world's preeminent power, having upheld the idea of
international community for nearly 75 years, rejects it in favor of ad
hoc deal making, others have no choice but to follow suit. [Countries
that can no longer rely on the US feel pressure to provide for their own
security. America's adversaries inevitably will seek to **fill the
voids** left behind as the US **retrenches**]{.underline}.

## Cap Good / Sustainable

#### Cap is [sustainable]{.underline} and [self-correcting]{.underline}.

**Hansen 21 \[Tyler; September 2021; Ph.D. Candidate in the Department
of Economics at the University of Massachusetts; \"Three Essays on the
Political Economy of Global Inaction on Climate Change,\"
<https://doi.org/10.7275/23620313>\]**

Second, the costs of climate stabilization are sometimes treated as pure
costs. That is, stabilizing the climate will bring about only climate
benefits, not economic benefits, and thus will negatively impact
economic growth. Both Victor (2012) and Jackson (2016) express this
view. However, investments in climate mitigation should be viewed as
investments. These investments are substantial---in the range of 2-2.5%
of GDP per year to achieve the 1.5 °C target (Pollin 2019b; Jacobson et
al. 2019). But they can be expected to generate millions of jobs, create
a more efficient energy system, stimulate a new wave of technological
innovation, and save millions of lives every year from reduced air
pollution. Jacobson et al. (2019), for example, estimates that a 100%
clean energy transition will reduce private energy costs from \$18
trillion to \$7 trillion per year. In addition, a substantial portion of
clean energy investments will be matched by a decline in fossil fuel
investments.

Third, degrowth proponents regularly cite the fact that sufficient
absolute decoupling has not occurred, and use it to support their claim
that it cannot occur (e.g., Kallis 2011; Jackson 2016; Schor and
Jorgenson 2019a, 2019b). The modelling and evidence presented in
Sections 1.2.1.2 and 1.2.1.3 disputes these claims, showing that a
global climate stabilization program amounting to 1.5-2.5% of global GDP
per year can achieve sufficient absolute decoupling.

Finally, revolution and degrowth proponents tend to use extreme climate
projections, especially for developed economies. For example, Jackson
and Victor (2019) and Kallis (2020) argue that developed economies must
achieve net-zero emission by 2030. The logic behind this claim is that
developing economies should be allowed to continue increasing emissions
for years to come. Schor and Jorgenson (2019a) and Malm (2014) cite a
2012 paper by Kevin Anderson suggesting that for a 50% chance of
limiting warming to 2 °C, net-zero emissions must be achieved globally
between 2035 and 2045. Foster et al. (2011) quote climate scientist
James Hansen, who claims, "the only resolution \[to climate change\] is
for humans to move to a fundamentally different energy system within a
decade." Foster et al. then claim, "this raises the question of more
revolutionary social change as an ecological as well as social
necessity" (Ch. 6). The IPCC (2018b), widely considered the gold
standard for climate science research, disputes these claims. According
to the IPCC, for an even chance of limiting warming to 1.5 °C above
preindustrial levels, humanity must achieve net-zero carbon emissions
around 2050. For 2 °C, this is pushed back to 2070. Developed economies
should certainly be more ambitious, but rather than allowing developing
economies to continue to develop on dirty energy, a better approach is
to provide them with the necessary resources to develop on clean energy.
Finally, even if it turns out that Kevin Anderson is right, attempting
to achieve degrowth or a revolution would only add to the challenge.
This is shown in the next section.

#### Capitalism is sustainable\-\--reflexivity fosters an innovative landscape of green tech that solves their unsustainability warrants.

Reflexive political economy stems from the work of ecological
modernization and risk society scholars writing in the 1980s, 1990s, and
turn of the 21st century. These scholars shared the idea that modern,
**[capitalist society possessed a potential for
reflexivity]{.underline}**, whereby market mechanisms and voluntary
agreements between states and **[corporations]{.underline}** would
**[incorporate ecological costs and environmental planning to
sustainably transform industrial production]{.underline}** (Huber 1985).

Ecological modernization scholars of the 1990s extended upon Huber's
transformation thesis by arguing in favor of "super-industrialization"
in order to accelerate the movement towards green or eco-friendly
capitalism (Spaargaren and Mol 1992). A more **[technologically
efficient marketplace]{.underline}** and ecologically aware state
apparatus paired with an ecologically concerned civil society would
steer this market-friendly, eco-structural shift (Janicke 1990; Mol
1996). Ultimately, such institutional ecological concern, or
reflexivity, would **[transform]{.underline}** even **[the
global]{.underline}**, **[capitalist marketplace]{.underline}** into a
source of **[sustainable development]{.underline}** (Mol and Spaargaren
2000; Mol 2002). Indeed, these theorists reasoned that **[expansionary,
capitalist development was essential]{.underline}**, as
**[increased]{.underline}** levels of **[wealth]{.underline}** were
**[needed to invest in]{.underline}** state management and more
**[efficient technologies]{.underline}**. **[Reflexivity]{.underline}**,
then, works as a social force that **[stimulates
decoupling]{.underline}** of economic growth from environmental impact.
Further, it provides a theoretical **[justification for eco-modernist
optimism surrounding]{.underline}** the potential for the market and
technology to overcome **[ecological problems]{.underline}** without
serious structural change (Lomborg 2001; Shellenberger and Nordhaus
2012).

Importantly, reflexivity signals incorporation of ecological concern at
multiple levels within a society. Early reflexive political economy
scholars characterized **[reflexivity]{.underline}** as an
**[increasingly important feature of]{.underline}** modern **[capitalist
society]{.underline}**. For example, Beck argued that reflexivity "seems
to be producing a new kind of capitalism," that could potentially
**[manage the]{.underline}** growing **[threat of mega-ecological
risk]{.underline}** (Beck 2003:2--3; Beck 2000). Similarly, Mol (1996)
argued that growing ecological reflexivity characterized modern
institutions.

From this standpoint, ecological degradation became a unique force of
social change. The growing existential threat posed by heightened
ecological risk, what Beck (1992) called mega-hazards, would pressure
powerful institutions to better regulate the environment. As Giddens
(1990) argued, the "high consequence risks" of contemporary capitalism
transcend "all exclusionary divisions of power." Thus, the mega-hazard
provides what Beck (1989) called a boomerang effect, where the once
"latent side effects" of industrial era capitalism now pose a risk to
all classes, nationalities, and identities to the point where "victim
and perpetrator (have) become equal" (Beck 1989:38). The transition to
what Beck (2010:206) called a "**[green capitalism]{.underline}**" was
therefore born from the reality of universalized risk.

It follows that early ecological modernization and risk society scholars
suggested that **[reflexivity]{.underline}** would **[occur
within]{.underline}** the framework of **[capitalist
society]{.underline}**. These reflexive political economy scholars thus
advanced an institutional level, ecological risk transcendence thesis,
which argued that **[powerful institutions]{.underline}** within a
capitalist society would **[accept]{.underline}** the reality of
**[ecological threats and act accordingly]{.underline}** to reduce those
threats. Reflexive political economy scholars suggested that key
institutions within capitalist society, like **[the state and the
private sector]{.underline}**, would **[steer]{.underline}** this shift
**[toward eco-friendly capitalism]{.underline}** via **[the greening of
markets]{.underline}**---what we call positive commodification---and
**[increased development]{.underline}** of efficient technological
innovations.

Rising cultural and civic demand would support the implementation of
ecological protection. As Mol (1996:30) called it, the "**[ecologisation
of the economy]{.underline}**," would be steered by the emergence of an
increasingly reflexive state but, also, broader social participation in
groups like environmental NGO's, as well as rising demand for green
consumption (Mol and Spaargaren 2000; Mol and Jänicke 2009). These
forces were, it was argued, congealing in the vacuum of state failure,
where overly centralized and bureaucratic, hierarchical state
functioning would give way to new, more effective and democratic
opportunities for green political modernization (Jänicke 1990;
Spaargaren 1997). Thus, the state, guided by more critically aware and
participatory governance, plays an important role as well.

The shared understanding of growing, socio-cultural reflexivity that
permeates across social actors and levels further links ecological
modernization and risk society thinking. As Giddens (1999) noted, there
is an emergent, collective realization of ecological risk, where, for
example, a consumer must now engage reflexively to answer everyday
questions---that is, should I buy organic or not? What Beck (2015:76)
called an "existential violation" characterizes this widespread
dissemination of ecological risk, whereby everyone, from the individual
consumer to the multi-national firm, must now contemplate their actions
in conversation with looming ecological implications.

Therefore, **[reflexivity]{.underline}** as a theorized mechanism is a
complex and dynamic force that **[drives change at multiple
levels]{.underline}**. Conceptually, we understand reflexive political
economy's key supposition as follows: capitalist society **[advances
through developmental stages]{.underline}**, and advanced capitalist
institutions exist in a stage characterized by widespread cultural and
material **[confrontations with ecological risk]{.underline}** that
provide the motivation to reduce it. At the turn of the 20th century,
York and Rosa (2003) challenged ecological
**[modernization]{.underline}** (and, hence, reflexive political
economy) to **[go beyond merely suggesting]{.underline}** that
institutions make allusions to ecological concern and instead
demonstrate that such reflexive modification actually **[leads to
real]{.underline}**, net **[ecological improvements]{.underline}**.
Indeed, at some point, the validity of reflexivity hinges on its power
as a force to induce generalizable ecological improvement. It could be
that reflexive political economic theory, which largely emanated from
Northern and Western Europe, has a bias due to geo-political origins.
This could account for the framework's strong optimism in the capacity
of a social democratic state, civil society, and progressively minded
populous to ameliorate environmental risk.

#### Capitalist profit motive key to [innovation]{.underline}.

For one, **[using law or regulation to create distance between companies
and profit]{.underline}**-seeking **[is likely to stymie
welfare-enhancing innovations. A central theme]{.underline}** throughout
Edmans's book **[is that profit]{.underline}** is not profligate;
rather, it **[is the engine]{.underline}** oil **[for]{.underline}** the
**[human]{.underline}** wheel of **[progress]{.underline}**. Edmans
refers to the social benefits of corporate innovation no less than
eighty-four times throughout the book, with numerous examples
illustrating a virtuous chain: **[profit incentivizes experimentation,
which leads to break-through technologies, medicines, or]{.underline}**
consumer **[services, ultimately enhancing human
welfare]{.underline}**.48 Indeed, **[that capitalism and the corporation
are at the heart of]{.underline}** human **[progress seems difficult to
deny]{.underline}**---simply ask yourself to **[name a great
civilization that was created by a stakeholder-oriented
society]{.underline}** (or, put differently, **[that did not look
favorably on free markets, industry, and trade]{.underline}**). In some
ways, I would go further than Edmans here. At times, he may be overly
sanguine in presuming that companies are inspired to innovate for
innovation's sake irrespective of profit potential.49 It seems more like
the exception than the rule: **[companies might be willing to subsidize
research in the hopes of the rare breakthrough]{.underline}**--- **[but
profit is always part of the equation]{.underline}**. So,
**[Edmans]{.underline}** is correct that corporate innovation is
socially beneficial, but **[may]{.underline}** well
**[underestimate]{.underline}** (at least in certain parts) **[the
extent to which profit is the motivational spark]{.underline}**, in one
way or another. But overall, Edmans's general point is quite well taken:
the realization **[that we need successful companies that are focused on
innovation should put the brakes on]{.underline}** stakeholder
capitalists' **[moves to hamstring corporate profit]{.underline}**.
After all, **[forcing companies to forgo profits is likely to translate
directly and in the first instance to the R&D line item in the corporate
budget.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalism is the [best solution]{.underline} to war, but there is no root cause.

Transnationalization at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, PhD in
economics from the University of Paderborn. *Handbook of Research on
Economic Freedom*. Edward Elgar Publishing. 360-363.

First, economic freedom is associated with the freedom to
**[trade]{.underline}** internationally as well as the promotion of
economic exchange within a country (e.g., by removing regulations that
would complicate internal trade and exchange). Consequently, economic
freedom [creates]{.underline} economic
**[interdependencies]{.underline}** between people and regions (i.e.,
domestically) as well as between countries (i.e., internationally).
These interdependencies, in turn, ought [to **disincentivize
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in a world of economic
interdependencies, [economic bonds could be **destroyed** in a war,
making peace]{.underline} and war [a matter of **cost-benefit
calculus**]{.underline}, with the destroyed bonds constituting a high
cost for any expected utility-maximizing government (Schneider 2010). In
a similar vein, while economic freedom may allow for the substitution of
trading partners, potentially reducing bilateral interdependencies, thus
making conflict more likely (Martin et al. 2008),
**[multilateral]{.underline}** economic [interdependencies]{.underline}
within a globalized world (as facilitated by economic freedom) may
[lead]{.underline} economically invested [**third parties** to
show]{.underline} their [disapproval of]{.underline} bilateral
[conflict]{.underline} by sending trade-based signals of resolve (Kinne
2014). This holds not only for interstate war but also for internal war,
which some trading partners may aim to stop through, for example,
interventions (Bussmann and Schneider 2007; Powell and Chacha 2016).

Second, [economic freedom is]{.underline} also [linked to]{.underline}
low levels of taxation and [small government]{.underline} (e.g.,
measured as government expenditure as a share of total GDP).
[If]{.underline} potential [participants]{.underline} of conflict [are
motivated]{.underline} by a desire [to **capture rents**, a smaller
government constitutes a **smaller prize**]{.underline} that would have
to be compared with the payoff from non-violence. Consequently, for
example, as shown in Kirk's (1983) model, [smaller
governments]{.underline} (as a consequence of economic freedom) are
expected to [see **less conflict**]{.underline} compared with larger
governments (where the prize of conflict is comparatively larger).

Third, economic freedom may be conducive to economic growth and
**[development]{.underline}**, e.g., as higher levels of economic
freedom [coincide with stronger property rights]{.underline}; stronger
[property rights]{.underline}, in turn, [incentivize
innovation]{.underline} and thus, ultimately, productivity gains and
economic development (see de Haan and Sturm 2024 in this volume).
Similarly, Vadlamannati and de Soysa (2014) argue that sound legal
institutions that safeguard [profits create incentives for investment
into]{.underline} (**[civilian]{.underline}**) [production, making
this]{.underline} type of investment [**more attractive**
than]{.underline} investment into [warfare]{.underline}. As a final
example, [economic freedom may]{.underline} help to
[channel]{.underline} the struggle caused by incompatible (economic)
goals into a [competition]{.underline} for [but not]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} over mobile financial, physical or human capital;
here, economic exchange acts as a signaling and communication device
(O'Neal and Russett 1999; Gartzke et al. 2001). Mobile capital, in turn,
is an important input for economic growth and development (e.g.,
Grossman and Helpman 1993). For instance, Gartzke (2005, p. 32)
di\\scusses how economic freedom interacts with international factor
mobility:

Economic freedom means you can take \[your wealth\] with you. When
conditions get bad domestically, capital can leave the country, creating
an economic, and thus political, drain on the society. Obviously,
governments do not want money to leave. To the degree that sovereigns
are unable to stop the flight of capital, however, they must create
conditions that favor the voluntary retention of money within their
borders.

By fostering **[economic success]{.underline}**, higher levels of
economic freedom [could]{.underline} thus [make it less
likely]{.underline} that potentially violent [actors will
have]{.underline} to engage in conflict to satisfy their
**[greed]{.underline}** for resources or accommodate their economic
grievances, [given]{.underline} that [more resources will be
available]{.underline} to them [through]{.underline} the marketplace in
the process of economic **[development]{.underline}**. The basic
underlying assumption here is that the probability of an internal and
international war to occur is a decreasing function of per capita income
(e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998; Schneider 2010).

Fourth, [economic freedom may be linked to]{.underline} other
**[institution]{.underline}**al outcome**[s]{.underline}** that are
[conducive to non-violent]{.underline} conflict
[resolution]{.underline}. For instance, a sound [**rule of law** is a
crucial element of]{.underline} sound [market]{.underline}
institution[s]{.underline}. At the same time, [a]{.underline}n impartial
and [functioning **judiciary**]{.underline} also [underpins democratic
development]{.underline} (e.g., Larkins 1996). Indeed, [economic freedom
and democracy are]{.underline} usually **[positively
related]{.underline}** (see Choutagunta and Gutmann 2024 in this volume)
and argued to give rise -- in combination -- to a (capitalist and)
democratic peace (Russett 1993; Rummel 1997). What is more,
[economically free countries are characterized by]{.underline} a wide
[**dispersion of power** because of market]{.underline} and political
[competition]{.underline}. For instance, [this may prevent]{.underline}
(small) [**elites** from abusing]{.underline} their [power]{.underline}
to start conflicts out of self-interest and at the expense of not only
their enemies but also domestic non-elites.

Fifth, [economic freedom may]{.underline} also [foster
**values**]{.underline} that are [conducive to peace]{.underline}.
Indeed, the idea of doux commerce (voiced by Montesquieu and others)
already emphasized the 'civilizing' potential of economic exchange as
such exchange is argued to produce gentleness, honesty and understanding
during the Enlightenment. In detail, [economic freedom may promote
**social trust** and **tolerance**]{.underline} (e.g., Berggren and
Jordahl 2006; Berggren and Nilsson 2013). For instance, large and free
markets (which are likely outcomes of high levels of economic freedom)
facilitate trust in others [because]{.underline} such trust makes it
more likely to engage in voluntary [**transactions** and]{.underline}
build long-lasting **[business relations]{.underline}**, especially when
market participants do not know each other (e.g., Platteau 2000). Trust,
[tolerance]{.underline} and related values, in turn, [make it less
likely that conflict breaks out]{.underline}, e.g., because religious
cleavages are less likely to be influential (e.g., Weingast 1998).

In sum, conceptualizing violent conflict as a function of cost--benefit
considerations of potential conflict participants (e.g., states,
insurgent or terrorist groups) that respond rationally to (economic)
incentives, we can discuss how economic freedom may matter to the
emergence of conflict. More specifically, one could think of a
theoretical framework in which economic freedom (or specific aspects of
economic freedom) affects directly or indirectly (via certain mediators)
the incidence of peace or conflict. In addition, there may be moderating
factors that make the link between economic freedom and peace or
conflict more or less relevant; for instance, this may concern regional
and institutional bonds (e.g., the European Union considers itself
explicitly as a peace project; Birchfeld et al. 2017) or a shared
ethnicity or religion (e.g., Woodwell 2004).

Indeed, [there are **various pathways**]{.underline} through which
higher levels of economic freedom are expected to reduce the likelihood
of different types of conflict, including, for example, increased
economic interdependencies, strong levels of economic development as
well as the development of sound, democratic, pro-peace institutions and
values. At the same time, we acknowledge that [not all types of conflict
are]{.underline} anticipated to be affected by economic freedom (and its
specific sub-categories) in [the same]{.underline} way. For instance,
one may hypothesize that the promotion of international trade through
the dismantling of trade barriers (which would indicate higher levels of
economic freedom) may be especially relevant to conflict between states.
Similarly, [while the overall effect]{.underline} of economic freedom on
conflict [is]{.underline} expected to be [**favorable**, we **cannot**
identify a **single** mechanism]{.underline} (mediator)
[that]{.underline} alone [explains this]{.underline} relationship. In
other words, specific ingredients of economic freedom (while related to
non-violence in theory) may not be sufficient to guarantee a peaceful
outcome. For instance, again consider international trade and interstate
war. When threats are highly asymmetric, one's opponent may consider the
reluctance to endanger the benefits of prosperous economic ties as
weakness (Gartzke 2005). In this situation, even for positive-sum games
it has to be guaranteed that 'all possible participants must be
unwilling to play the game of chicken or, indeed, to use military force'
(Gartzke 2005, p. 32). Hence, the opportunity costs of foregoing one's
share in the mutual benefits from trade are -- alone -- insufficient to
guarantee peace.

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

Having discussed various mechanisms through which economic freedom may
influence violent conflict, in this section we discuss the empirical
evidence that relates (higher levels of) economic freedom to (reduced)
international conflict, i.e., conflict between states, as well as to
reduced internal conflict in the form of civil war and terrorism.

Economic Freedom and Interstate War

A first set of studies considers the effect of higher levels of economic
freedom on the emergence of violent conflict between two or more
nation-states. For instance, this type of conflict may take the form of
a militarized interstate dispute (i.e., the display of military force
short of war by one state explicitly directed towards another state) or
a conflict that involves a minimum level of battle deaths to qualify as
a full-blown war (Anderton and Carter 2011).

[A **number** of empirical studies provide evidence in favor
of]{.underline} a **[capitalist peace]{.underline}**, where sound
economic institutions (i.e., high levels of economic freedom) coincide
with a reduced likelihood of militarized disputes and warfare between
nation-states (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001, Mousseau et al. 2003; Souva
2004; Mousseau 2005, 2009; Gartzke 2007; McDonald 2010). For example,
Gartzke (2007) [examines a **global sample**]{.underline} of countries
[between **1950** and **1992**, finding]{.underline} that high levels of
external [openness discourage conflict]{.underline} between states.

Consistent with our theoretical discussion above, several [empirical
contributions highlight the role]{.underline} international [**trade**
plays]{.underline} in creating economic interdependencies and wealth
that disincentivizes interstate conflict (e.g., Hegre 2000; Gartzke and
Li 2003; Gelpi and Grieco 2008). International trade ought to be fueled
by high levels of economic freedom, e.g., by means of low tariffs and
low trade regulations. Other voices emphasize the role sound economic
institutions may play in the development of institutions and values that
promote equality, tolerance and respect for the rights of others (e.g.,
Mousseau 2009).

In sum, [**many** empirical studies suggest]{.underline} that there is a
**[capitalist peace]{.underline}**, with countries that are economically
free being less likely to engage in conflict with other countries. At
the same time, this finding points to one important aspect that is also
the subject of academic debate. How does economic liberalism (high
levels of economic freedom) interact with political liberalism (high
levels of political freedom) and how do both variables affect conflict
(e.g., Schneider 2014)? In this contribution, we cannot discuss at
length the nuances of the literature on the capitalist peace vis-à-vis
the democratic peace. However, our reading of the capitalist peace
literature highlights two major points. First, sound economic
institutions appear to lead to less interstate conflict independent of
the effect of democracy (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001; Mousseau et al.
2003). Second, it is possible that economic and political freedom
reinforce each other, with both also potentially sharing a beneficial
relationship with economic development, suggesting that rich,
[economically **and** politically liberal countries]{.underline} may
[see]{.underline} especially [low levels of]{.underline} international
[conflict]{.underline} (e.g., Mousseau 2005).

DISCUSSION

As noted in the introduction to this chapter, capitalism is often
criticized for generating unsustainable economic inequalities. If we
conceptualize capitalism as economic freedom, those holding such a view
believe that there exists a positive relationship between economic
freedom and inequality. Yet, the **[empirical ev]{.underline}**idence
surveyed in this chapter [suggests the relationship is]{.underline}
considerably more [**complicated**, with the choice of sample, measures,
and methodology]{.underline} often [influencing the results]{.underline}
(Bennett and Nikolaev 2017a; Callais and Young 2023). As suggested by
numerous studies, [the]{.underline} distributional [impact]{.underline}
of changes in economic freedom [may be **conditional** on other factors
such as]{.underline}, for example, economic [**development**,
**political regime**]{.underline} type, [or the **level** of economic
freedom]{.underline}. Thus, [further exploration]{.underline} of
potential moderating factors [is needed]{.underline} to advance our
understanding of how economic freedom influences economic inequality.
Additional studies that examine the distributional consequences of
understudied aspects of economic freedom using novel data sources would
also advance knowledge of the economic freedom--inequality relationship.

[Research]{.underline} on economic freedom and inequality has expanded
to encompass various dimensions of inequality. Initial [findings
suggest]{.underline} that [economic freedom is associated
with]{.underline} a more [equal distribution of **happiness** and
**reduced healthcare inequality**]{.underline}. It also influences
racial and gender disparities, with heterogenous effects across
subgroups. Although not covered in this survey, studies on equality of
opportunity indicate that [economic freedom is linked to **greater
equity** in **education**, **health**, and **justice**]{.underline} (de
Soysa and Vadlamannati 2021), [as well as **higher socio-economic
mobility**]{.underline} (Boudreaux 2014; Dean and Geloso 2022; Callais
and Geloso 2023). However, economic liberalization may negatively impact
intergenerational social mobility in transition economies (Gugushvili
2017). These emerging research areas, supported by advancements in data
analytics and multilevel methods, offer ample opportunities for scholars
to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between economic
freedom and inequality.
