AI for predicting climate impact on crop yield

**[Agriculture is deeply intertwined with the
environment]{.underline}**. Conventional farming practices contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, soil erosion, and water
contamination. By adopting sustainable methods like conservation
agriculture, agroforestry, and precision farming, we can mitigate
agriculture\'s environmental impact and foster sustainable land and
resource management. **[Climate change is marked by increased
unpredictability. To bolster resilience against climate-related
challenges, farmers must adapt.]{.underline}** Strategies such as
planting drought-resistant crops, optimizing irrigation, and employing
climate-smart technologies can help mitigate losses and ensure continued
production.35 **[Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is poised to
revolutionize the sector through the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). This emerging paradigm positions AI as a key tool in
addressing climate change challenges]{.underline}**. This paper explores
the interplay between AI and CSA research, focusing on **[AI\'s
potential to enhance adaptation strategies in smart agricultural
technologies.]{.underline}** Agriculture is a major contributor to GHG
(Greenhouse Gass) emissions, primarily methane from livestock and
nitrous oxide from fertilizers and soil management. CSA aims to mitigate
these emissions by promoting practices that reduce GHG release and
enhance carbon sequestration in soils and vegetation. This includes
precision nutrient management, agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
and renewable energy use.36--39

**[AI-powered systems can analyze crop images to identify diseases,
nutrient deficiencies, and pest infestations. By using computer vision
and machine learning, AI detects visual patterns linked to crop health
issues, enabling farmers to take early action and apply targeted
treatments, reducing crop losses and optimizing resource use. AI is
essential to precision agriculture, optimizing resource allocation and
boosting crop yields. AI algorithms analyze data from sensors, drones,
and satellites to provide insights into soil conditions, weather, and
crop growth]{.underline}**. This information allows farmers to tailor
irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide applications to specific field
areas, minimizing waste and maximizing productivity.40

Autonomous equipment precisely performs planting, harvesting, and
weeding, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual labor. In livestock
farming, robots automate feeding, monitoring, and milking, ensuring
consistent and optimal care. AI aids in livestock health and welfare
monitoring. Sensors and cameras collect data on animal behavior, feed
intake, and health metrics. AI algorithms analyze this data, enabling
early disease detection, prediction, and optimized feeding and breeding.
This improves animal welfare, boosts productivity, and lowers veterinary
expenses. AI aids in environmental monitoring, assessing soil health,
water quality, and biodiversity. AI algorithms analyze sensor data to
identify environmental risks and optimize resource use. This promotes
sustainable farming, reduces environmental impact, and conserves natural
resources.40

Enhancing drought tolerance through AI (artificial intelligence)

**[Using advanced technologies such as robotics, connected devices,
neural networks, and machine learning, farmers are using safe solutions
to more effectively deal with agricultural problems. This technology
supports, imagery analysis, and remote monitoring of the weather for
enhancing quality and increasing the number of harvests for
farmers]{.underline}**.41,42

Early identification and forecasting

**[Drought can be detected early by AI algorithms]{.underline}** through
the use of diverse sources such as weather conditions, satellite images
depicting vegetation's health, and soil moisture data. **[AI brings
hopes and enables both authorities and farmers to take proactive
measures to lessen the detrimental effects of drought by issuing
warnings and making accurate predictions. Afterwards, AI can also
estimate how bad the drought will get and how long it will last, which
allows for timely action. This ability in forecasting is very essential
in the management of drought]{.underline}** because it creates a time
frame in which efforts to mitigate crop losses, conserve water, and
offer assistance to the affected people can be made.15,43

Optimized water use

**[The artificial intelligence systems can enhance water management in
agriculture by effectively assessing the soil moisture content and the
crops' water needs. Meanwhile, with the help of data, the AI also helps
the farmers to water their crops in an efficient manner reducing water
wastage]{.underline}** and ensuring that ideal conditions for the crops
are maintained during the dry season.44

Just like virtual water managers for farmers, **[AI is able to evaluate
information on soil moisture, climate, and the crop growth stage in
order to determine how much water each crop needs]{.underline}**. This
allows farmers to plan their irrigation periods appropriately, making it
possible to use the right quantity of water for each crop without having
too much or too little water which affects crop yield or quality
negatively.45

Development of drought resilient crops

One high-quality manner wherein synthetic intelligence boosts the speed
of plant breeding is via analyzing genetic statistics to determine sure
characteristics with drought tolerance inside crops. By predicting how
different types of vegetation might perform all through varied
drought-like situations, **[AI allows breeders to broaden crop types
which have growth in water-pressured locations. This predictive
capability has the power of AI enhance growing drought-resistant crops,
therefore advancing agricultural resilience.]{.underline}** In precis,
artificial intelligence is hired to test giant sets of genetic facts for
drought resistance genes. Once the ones genes are recognized, those can
then be implemented for the duration of breeding programs to expand
novel crop types. The change climatic scenarios which have been modelled
are studied with the aid of breeders to recognize what could happen if
the newly evolved type is cultivated with water scarcity conditions.
These determined genes can later be utilized to create new crop
varieties through breeding programs. **[Modeling one of a kind climate
scenarios with the help of AI lets in breeders to expect how these new
types will behave when there\'s a lack of water, for you to pick the
maximum promising opportunities for cultivation in dry
areas]{.underline}**.46--48

#### The net benefit is Space Debris:

#### Increased satellite surveillance of Arctic causes Space Debris---their 1AC author/article

**[UN Guidelines]{.underline}** for the Long-term Sustainability of
Outer Space Activities^28)^ **[define the long-term sustainability of
outer space activities as "the ability to maintain the conduct of space
activities indefinitely into the future]{.underline}** in a manner that
realizes the objectives of equitable access to the benefits of the
exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, in order to
meet the needs of the present generations while preserving the outer
space environment for future generations".^29)^\
 Sustainable use and protection of space infrastructures is an obvious
prerequisite for the ability to maintain the conduct of space
activities.

**[Space infrastructure is critically important for society and at the
same time vulnerable to disruption. Space infrastructure serves not only
economy but also society, including its contribution to systems who
disruption or destruction would generate significant economic damage,
casualties, and loss of confidence]{.underline}**.^30)^ As J. Pelton
(2015) points out, "\[s\]pace systems have become so vital, that if we
were suddenly denied access to our space-based infrastructure for
weather forecasting and warning, for space-based navigation and timing,
for civil and military communications, and for remote sensing and
surveillance from space, we would be in danger".^31)^ This applies also
to space infrastructures supporting the Arctic region, with its
increasingly challenging security framework.^32)^

**[Space infrastructure is included in the definition of a critical
infrastructure in Norway and other countries.^33)^ A serious implication
of a disruption of a critical infrastructure is that it causes cascading
effects leading to cascading disasters.^34)^ Addressing
interdependencies of critical infrastructure is a key feature of the
critical infrastructure protection.]{.underline}** As pointed out by
Georgescu, "resilience is the only consistent answer to the issues of
uncertainty and complexity" pertaining to critical
infrastructures.^35)^ Coordination of all actors concerned is one of the
crucial means to accomplish strong resilience of the space
infrastructure against naturally caused disruption (e.g. extreme solar
storms) and deliberate disruptions.^36)^

In addition to solar weather and deliberate actions, **[growing amounts
of space debris also endanger the safe and sustainable operation of
satellites already in a short and medium terms. Small and microsatellite
constellations in the near-Earth orbits (such as polar orbits) are in
this respect very problematic due to the high number of objects in
already congested orbits. Already today we should work to prevent a
cascading build-up known as the "Kessler syndrome" from
occurring]{.underline}**, i.e. cascading effect of debris elements
colliding with other debris elements, thus creating dense debris rings
which would preclude safe launch and operation of spacecraft.^37)^ In
the long-term perspective, space debris may compromise interests of
future generations in sustainable space-based services, thus conflicting
with UN Sustainable Development Goals and Long Term Sustainability
Guidelines.

#### Increased debris from climate modelling causes Kessler syndrome tipping point---destroys utility of near Earth orbit

**Impey, 2023** (Chris Impey, university distinguished professor of
astronomy at the University of Arizona, 9/3/2023, \"Analysis: Why trash
in space is a major problem with no clear fix\", PBS News,

DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

Space is getting crowded

People think of space as vast and empty, but **[the near-Earth
environment is starting to get crowded. As many as 100 lunar
missions are planned over the next decade by governments and private
companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.]{.underline}**

**[Near-Earth orbit is even more congested than the space between Earth
and the Moon. It's from 100 to 500 miles straight up]{.underline}**,
compared with 240,000 miles to the Moon. **[Currently there are nearly
7,700 satellites within a few hundred miles of the Earth. That number
could grow to several hundred thousand by 2027. Many of these
satellites]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** be used to deliver
internet to developing countries or to **[monitor agriculture and
climate on Earth]{.underline}**. Companies like SpaceX have dramatically
lowered launch costs, driving this wave of activity.

"**[It's going to be like an interstate highway, at rush hour in a
snowstorm, with everyone driving much too fast,"]{.underline}** space
launch expert Johnathan McDowell told Space.com.

The problem of space junk

**[All this activity creates]{.underline}** hazards and
**[debris]{.underline}**. Humans have left a lot of junk on the Moon,
including spacecraft remains like rocket boosters from over 50 crashed
landings, nearly 100 bags of human waste and miscellaneous objects like
a feather, golf balls and boots. It adds up to around 200 tons of our
trash.

Since no one owns the Moon, no one is responsible for keeping it clean
and tidy.

The clutter in Earth's orbit includes defunct spacecraft, spent rocket
boosters and items discarded by astronauts such as a glove, a wrench and
a toothbrush. It also includes tiny pieces of debris like paint flecks.

There are around 23,000 objects larger than 10 cm (4 inches) and about
100 million pieces of debris larger than 1 mm (0.04 inches). Tiny pieces
of junk might not seem like a big issue, but that debris is moving at
15,000 mph (24,140 kph), 10 times faster than a bullet. At that speed,
even a fleck of paint can puncture a spacesuit or destroy a sensitive
piece of electronics.

The amount of debris in orbit has increased dramatically since the
1960s.

In 1978, NASA scientist Donald **[Kessler described a scenario where
collisions between orbiting pieces of debris create more debris, and the
amount of debris grows exponentially, potentially rendering near-Earth
orbit unusable.]{.underline}** Experts call this the "Kessler syndrome."

Chapter 10: Remote Sensing: Environmental Monitoring and Science [For
over 30 years, we\'ve been able to monitor global climate patterns and
changes using satellite remote sensing. Much of what we\'ve learned
about the cycles that drive our]{.underline} climate and our
[technological civilization\'s impact on the global ecosystem has come
from satellite observations. Without updated information from space, we
would be \[**ruined**\]]{.underline} ~~crippled~~ [in our ability to
monitor atmospheric changes, global rainfall patterns, and other
climatological indicators]{.underline} - leaving policy makers to make
decisions without the most significant part of their data in hand.
[Satellite systems make regional and **global resource monitoring**
possible]{.underline}. This is [because it is **very difficult** and
**costly** to conduct ground and aerial surveys over large areas and
then to coordinate the individual surveys by joining them together. To
collect data on a **global scale**, one **must** use the **unique
vantage point** provided by **space** systems. One of the **most
successful** applications of space imaging is monitoring the world\'s
**agricultural production**, including identifying and differentiating
most of the major crop types]{.underline}: wheat, barley, millet, oats,
corn, soybeans, rice, and others. [**Feeding the world** is **only
possible** because of our ability to **monitor** food production and
**rapidly adapt** to changes in the distribution system - and, in our
modem world, both of these **require** space satellite
systems]{.underline}. Satellite remote sensing has also been
successfully used in identifying mineral resources, particularly when
the data from various types of space-based sensors are combined and
compared. [Locating future sources of raw materials suddenly becomes
**much more difficult** and **costly** without satellite
data]{.underline}.

#### Debris triggers [miscalculated war]{.underline}.

Peter **Dockrill 16**. Award-winning science & technology journalist.
"Space Junk Accidents Could Trigger Armed Conflict, Study Finds."
<https://www.sciencealert.com/space-junk-accidents-could-trigger-armed-conflict-expert-warns>.

[The increasingly crowded space in Earth\'s low orbit could set the
stage for an **international armed conflict**]{.underline}, says a new
study. Researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences warn [that
accidents stemming from the steady rise in space junk floating around
the planet could incite **political rows** and even **warfare**, with
nations potentially **mistaking debris**-caused incidents as the results
of **intentional aggressive acts** by others.]{.underline} In a paper
published in Acta Astronautica, the [team suggests that space debris in
the form of spent rocket parts and other fragments of hardware hurtling
at high speed pose a \"**special political danger**\" that could
**dangerously escalate** tensions between nations.]{.underline}
According to the study, [destructive impacts caused by random space junk
cannot easily be told apart from military attacks.]{.underline} \"[The
owner of the impacted and destroyed satellite can hardly quickly
determine the real cause of the accident]{.underline},\" the authors
write. [The risks of such an event occurring are compounded by the
**sheer volume** of debris now orbiting Earth. Recent figures from NASA
indicate that there are more than 500,000 pieces of space junk currently
being tracked in orbit, travelling at speeds up to 28,160
km/h]{.underline} (17,500 mph). The majority of those objects are small
-- around the size of a marble -- but some 20,000 of them are bigger
than a softball. In addition to these 500,000 or so fragments -- which
are big enough for scientists to know about them -- [NASA estimates that
there are millions of undetectable pieces of debris in orbit that are
too small to be monitored. But even extremely small fragments such as
these pose a threat -- in fact, they\'re considered a greater risk than
trackable debris, as their **invisible status** means spacecraft and
satellites can\'t do anything to avoid them **until it\'s too
late.**]{.underline} As NASA observed in 2013: \"[Even tiny paint flecks
can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these
velocities]{.underline}. In fact a number of space shuttle windows have
been replaced because of damage caused by material that was analysed and
shown to be paint flecks... With so much orbital debris, there have been
surprisingly few disastrous collisions.\" [While we may have been lucky
in the past, **we can\'t rely on that to continue**]{.underline}. The
study by the Russian team [cites the repeated sudden failures of defence
satellites in past decades that were never explained. The researchers
attribute two possible causes: either unrecorded collisions with space
junk, or aggressive actions from adversaries. \"This is a **politically
dangerous dilemma**,\" the authors write.]{.underline}

Climate Prediction & Adaptation

ML **[algorithms analyze climate data to predict weather patterns and
optimize planting schedules. AI-driven models help farmers adapt
cultivation practices to changing conditions, improving resilience
against climate variability.]{.underline}**

Data-Driven Decision-Making

**[AI-driven insights are transforming farming practices by enhancing
data-driven decision-making]{.underline}**. For example, Climate
FieldView leverages AI to give farmers actionable insights from various
data sources, offering personalized planting advice, optimized seeding
rates, and guidance on the best times to water and apply fertilizers and
pesticides. **[The program can predict how variables, such as weather
changes or planting densities, might affect crop yields. This predictive
capability lets farmers make more informed decisions, increasing crop
productivity and reducing resource waste.]{.underline}**

IBM's **[Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture uses AI to analyze
weather data, satellite images, and other inputs, providing farmers with
actionable insights. The technology helps farmers precisely apply water,
fertilizers, and pesticides, reducing overuse and runoff.]{.underline}**

The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an excellent source for information on
how data is transforming agriculture, including an article titled "How
Is Agritech Helping to Optimize the Farming Sector?"^12^ and one on how
data-driven agri-tech services in Telangana, India, could add US
\$50-\$70 billion to the agriculture sector by 2025.^13^

Huge Opportunities

**[Farmers can achieve significant efficiency gains and economic returns
by leveraging AI-driven solutions while minimizing environmental impact.
Indeed, AI presents unprecedented opportunities to build
climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices]{.underline}**.
WEF elaborates on the benefits of AI in its article "Artificial
Intelligence for Agricultural Innovation,"^14^ and specific use cases
are described in the sidebar "AI in Action: Enhancing Agricultural
Practices."

However, **[concerted efforts by]{.underline}** multiple stakeholders
(**[governments]{.underline}**, agri-tech companies, and farmers)
**[will be needed to realize these opportunities. This may include
subsidizing AI implementations and investing in agricultural AI
R&D.]{.underline}** To foster wider adoption, we recommend tailored
education and training (e.g., Udemy courses) and the development of
shared, trusted, open data platforms providing secure, role-based access
to systems and stakeholders.

### 2NC Debris Impacts

#### 2NC OV---Increased debris in space triggers Kessler syndrome which collapses communications, the economy, agricultural production, and global militaries

**Shruthi, 2024** (Dr. R. Shruthi, 12-31-2024, \"Space Junk Threat: How
Kessler Syndrome Could Endanger the Future of Space\", Daily Guardian,
<https://thedailyguardian.com/medically-speaking/space-junk-threat-how-kessler-syndrome-could-endanger-the-future-of-space/>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

What is Kessler Syndrome?

**[Imagine a domino effect in Earth's orbit. Kessler Syndrome refers to
a theoretical scenario where the density of space debris becomes so high
that collisions between objects create even more debris. This cascading
chain reaction could ultimately make Earth's orbit unusable for
satellites and spacecraft.]{.underline}**

Proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, this concept was
initially hypothetical. However, **[with the exponential increase in
space activity, it is inching closer to reality.]{.underline}**
Currently, there are over 27,000 tracked pieces of debris, each larger
than 10 cm, and millions of smaller, untraceable fragments orbiting
Earth. Even a tiny fragment, moving at speeds of up to 28,000 kilometers
per hour, can cause catastrophic damage.

Why the Sudden Alarm?

**[In recent years, space activity has surged
dramatically]{.underline}**. Companies like SpaceX are launching
thousands of satellites for mega-constellations aimed at providing
global internet access. While these projects are revolutionary**[, they
also contribute significantly to space congestion]{.underline}**.
According to Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University
of Arizona, "**[The number of objects in space launched in the last four
years has increased exponentially."]{.underline}**

In 2009, a wake-up call came in the form of a collision between the
defunct Kosmos-2251 satellite and the operational Iridium-33
communications satellite. The impact created thousands of debris pieces,
many of which are still orbiting Earth today.

Similar incidents could set off the cascade envisioned by Kessler,
leading to a debris belt so dense that space exploration would become
nearly impossible.

How Would Kessler Syndrome Impact Modern Life?

**[The effects of Kessler Syndrome wouldn't just be confined to space;
they would ripple through every aspect of life on Earth.]{.underline}**

1\. Disruption of Communication Networks

**[Satellites form the backbone of global communication. GPS navigation,
internet services, television broadcasting, and emergency response
systems all depend on them. A dense debris field could wipe out this
critical infrastructure, plunging the world into a technological dark
age.]{.underline}**

2\. Threat to Space Exploration

**[A debris-filled orbit would make it nearly impossible to launch
spacecraft. This could halt scientific missions, including plans to
explore Mars and beyond.]{.underline}** Even vital operations like
resupplying the International Space Station (ISS) could be jeopardized.

3\. Economic Catastrophe

**[The global space industry, worth over \$400 billion, would face
devastating losses. Industries relying on satellite technology---like
telecommunications, agriculture, and finance---would also suffer severe
setbacks, causing a domino effect in the global economy.]{.underline}**

4\. Military and National Security Risks

**[Many nations rely on satellites for surveillance and defense. Losing
these capabilities could lead to geopolitical instability and increased
vulnerability to cyber or physical threats.]{.underline}**

## Peer Competitors Adv 

### No allied cooperation

#### Allied cooperation is key to solve Russia/China in the Arctic

**Garamone, 2024** (Jim Garamone, Dod News, 7-30-2024, \"Now the Hard
Part: Implementing Arctic Strategy\", U.S. Department of Defense,

of Form, DoA 6/6/2024, DVOG)

Dealing with allies and partners is really key to this effort, she said.
**[Cooperation in the Arctic continues America\'s greatest asymmetric
advantage: the network of allies. \"The Arctic has a unique
concentration of like-minded and highly capable allies,\" she said.
\"Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and our two newest NATO allies,
Finland and Sweden, all bring substantial regional know-how and
capability that strengthens our collective efforts to monitor and
respond in the Arctic.\" ]{.underline}**

There is already a baseline for this effort. For example, \"the U.S.
Marine Corps has long maintained pre-positioned combat equipment in
Norway to improve our ability to respond rapidly alongside Arctic allies
should deterrence fail,\" Dory said. \"We\'ve also increased rotations
of maritime patrol aircraft to Iceland to improve maritime domain
awareness when necessary and will continue to participate in Icelandic
air policing efforts.\" 

**[The United States has also signed defense cooperative agreements with
Sweden, Finland and Denmark, and updated a similar long-standing
agreement with Norway. \"In Europe and North America, we\'ve enhanced
our tailored presence through U.S. participation in exercises like
Nordic Response in the European Arctic, and Arctic Edge in Alaska.
Allies and partners are also a source of innovation and we\'re working
together to develop and feel the next generation of Arctic
capabilities]{.underline}**.\" 

Canada and the United States are already modernizing for the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, and the United States is
interoperable with a number of partner nations in the F-35 jet program
and the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. \"We\'re building
innovative partnerships such as one with Norway, which is hosting a U.S.
payload aboard Norway\'s Arctic satellite broadband mission, \[which
will\] bring much needed communications capabilities to our strategic
users in the Arctic region,\" Dory said.  

\"Going forward, we will look to identify opportunities to collaborate
more closely on Arctic capabilities research, development and
acquisition,\" she said. \"Additionally, we\'ll explore ways to deepen
intelligence and information sharing to maintain a shared threat
perception of the Arctic region.\" 

DOD looks to work more closely with U.S. entities as well, from the U.S.
Coast Guard to state government entities to Alaskan natives to industry
partners. \"We support the Coast Guard\'s program to strengthen U.S.
icebreaking capability, as it enables a key capability to ensure
interoperability between the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy vessels, and
to support U.S. presence in the Arctic,\" Dory said. \"**[The recent
announcement of U.S., Canada and Finland to collaborate on icebreaker
production is yet another example of the incredible cooperation
potential among Arctic allies to drive collective innovation and
capabilities.\"]{.underline}**

#### Trump's rhetoric around Greenland nuked Arctic alliance relationship

**Hughes, 2025** (Thomas Hughes, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Political
Studies, Mount Allison University, 1-19-2025, \"Allies or enemies?
Trump's threats against Canada and Greenland put NATO in a tough spot\",
Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/allies-or-enemies-trumps-threats-against-canada-and-greenland-put-nato-in-a-tough-spot-247194>,
DoA 6/12/2025, DVOG)

No need to take over Greenland

The second Trump administration could call on its considerable resources
to bolster Greenlandic defence and use the island for military activity
to enhance both U.S. security and that of NATO more broadly.

It's unlikely that there would be any objections to the U.S. building
infrastructure on the island, including port facilities and airstrips,
that could be used for civilian and military purposes.

**[Denmark had planned to enhance its military presence in the Arctic
prior to Trump's threats. If those plans are insufficient to the Trump
administration, it's unclear what more Denmark can do to demonstrate
that Greenland's contribution to American defence does not require the
U.S. to take formal control of the island.]{.underline}**

**[Evidence that the U.S. lacks faith in its allies is nothing
new]{.underline}** --- in 2013, it was revealed that U.S. intelligence
services had been tapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone since
2002, highlighting an American willingness to breach trust in service of
their own defence.

U.S. criticism of Canada providing insufficient defence capabilities is
a familiar refrain, and not unreasonable.

**[But to threaten annexing territory or, in Canada's case, make the
lives of Canadians so miserable through economic pressure that the
country's politicians are forced to consider territorial concessions is
a highly aggressive approach]{.underline}**.

Trump's aggressive rhetoric

**[This poses major problems for NATO.]{.underline}**

**[First, Trump's reluctance to rule out the use of military force to
annex Greenland violates provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, which
reaffirms members' UN commitment to "settle any international dispute in
which they may be involved by peaceful means ...and to refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner
inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."]{.underline}**

While the prospect of a U.S. military invasion of Denmark is remote,
it's hard to imagine that NATO could still function if it happened.

Second, Trump's extremist comments runs against NATO's principle of
clarity. Even if his rhetoric is written off as a deliberate "madman"
approach to politics or heavy-handed aggressive bargaining, it erodes
NATO's commitment to consistent messaging among its members.

Do Trump's threats about taking Canada by economic force simply reflect
an initial bargaining position, as some have argued? That's beside the
point: it would be foolhardy and naive for Canada to ignore his threats.

**[An example of the repercussions of those threats is evident in the
comments of Andrey Gurulyov, a former Russian military official who has
claimed there's now an opportunity for Russia to take Greenland itself
or "make a deal with Trump and split Greenland in two
parts.]{.underline}**"

Regardless of whether that's a realistic possibility, **[the fact that
Trump is floating the previously unthinkable prospect of a hostile U.S.
takeover of its allies' territory allows countries long considered
common NATO adversaries to capitalize on the chaos for their own
gain.]{.underline}**

Enmity or amity?

**[Trump has departed from the NATO and UN principles and agreement not
to threaten the use of force against allies.]{.underline}**

**[It's too extreme for Canada or Denmark to view the U.S. as an enemy
in the wake of Trump's threats, but if this coercion represents
friendship, the line between enmity and amity is currently
blurred.]{.underline}**

Trump may simply be trying to shock Canada and Denmark into increasing
their defence spending, accept a greater U.S. military presence and
provide the U.S. with more access to their resources. The second Trump
administration may ultimately be successful if that's the goal.

**[But the costs of taking such an aggressive approach may be that the
U.S. loses its ability to position itself as a trustworthy ally and
engage productively with allies and partners to support mutually
beneficial policy goals.]{.underline}**

This would critically undermine NATO's capability.

### No China War

#### No China war -- they're [militarily weak]{.underline} and predictions are alarmist.

First, [it is often stated]{.underline} that [China is arming
itsel]{.underline}f specifically in preparation [for a Taiwan
invasion]{.underline}. 2027 often figures as a possible date for such an
invasion, presumably because this year is an official milestone in the
Chinese military's modernization plans. [But the year 2027]{.underline}
**[hardly figures at all]{.underline}** [in the **scholarly
forecasts**]{.underline} [we have examined]{.underline}.

[Concerning China's military modernization]{.underline}, [forecasts do
point to growing risk]{.underline}, [but this is mainly a question
of]{.underline} the [**gradually** changing military
balance]{.underline} vis-a-vis the United States [in the
region]{.underline}. [A more even military balance inherently
means]{.underline} growing [risk, but that risk is growing from
a]{.underline} very **[low baseline probability]{.underline}**. It is
still true that [China]{.underline} **[cannot be confident to
win]{.underline}** [a war]{.underline} with the U.S. over Taiwan, [which
**keeps down** the **risk** for the present]{.underline}.

Second, it is said that China cannot accept Taiwan's democratic
institutions, and that conflict can only be averted by the United States
and other allies stepping up explicit support for Taiwan's independence.
But [forecasts]{.underline} instead [point to]{.underline} the
[worsening China-U.S. relationship]{.underline} itself [as one of the
major risk factors]{.underline}. [Growing tensions]{.underline} over
Taiwan [are a consequence of increasing great]{.underline} [power
conflict]{.underline}. [Beijing sees Taiwan as a **part
of**]{.underline} the **[U.S. sphere of influence]{.underline}**, [and
knows that an **attack on Taiwan is** a military **attack on
U.S.**]{.underline} interests[. If China-U.S. rivalry is kept
within]{.underline} [limits]{.underline}, [China has **little interest
in provoking**]{.underline} [such a conflict]{.underline}.

Third, [a common narrative]{.underline} among alarmists [is the story of
the changing Chinese regime]{.underline}. [They warn us of China's
increasingly aggressive posture]{.underline}, its growing
"assertiveness," and an alleged ideological turn away from "openness"
under the rule of Xi Jinping. [By contrast]{.underline}, [forecasters
are divided on the question of whether China's intentions]{.underline}
concerning Taiwan [have changed]{.underline} in any crucial regard. Xi
Jinping hews close to the traditional Communist Party line of
unquestioned sovereignty over Taiwan, and his international ambitions
are likewise inherited from his predecessors. Most of
[China's]{.underline} new-found "[assertiveness]{.underline}"
[is]{.underline} likely [less a matter of ideological change and
more]{.underline} a matter [of growing]{.underline}
**[capabilities]{.underline}**. From this, [one might conclude that
assumptions of **extreme urgency** on China's part **are
faulty**.]{.underline}

These are the takeaways from [available forecasts]{.underline}, and they
[stand in **stark contrast**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[alarmist
predictions]{.underline}** [from the U.S]{.underline}. military and
other actors. [They suggest that alarmist narratives are]{.underline}
[arrived at by looking at]{.underline} the **[growing
risk]{.underline}** of war **[in isolation]{.underline}**, [without
consideration o]{.underline}f its [general]{.underline} **[low baseline
probability]{.underline}**. Alarmists also tend to heavily exaggerate
the degree of internal change caused by Xi Jinping, which is a factor
that appears doubtful when aggregatin

#### No spillover\-\--China will not attempt a direct predatory challenge to the US.

**Shifrinson**, PhD, Assistant Professor of International Relations,

(Joshua, "The rise of China, balance of power theory and US national
security: Reasons for optimism?" *Journal of Strategic Studies*, Vol.
43)

This framework carries large implications for scholars and policymakers
seeking to understand China's strategy as its power grows and US
relative power declines. As noted, many analysts fear that a rising
China will embark on a predatory course designed to push the United
States down or from the great power ranks. Although it is difficult in
the abstract to describe what the particular elements of Chinese
predation may entail, [the general concern seems to be]{.underline} that
[China will adopt steps that will **rapidly shift the distribution of
power**]{.underline} its favour [by enacting policies that are
increasingly costly]{.underline} [for a]{.underline} relatively
[declining United States]{.underline} to overcome, [pushing the United
States to exhaust itself]{.underline} competing [or to surrender the
issues at stake]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus
**[imperil]{.underline}** [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[position as a great power]{.underline}. Elements of this approach might
involve Chinese efforts to engage in economic warfare by hindering US
economic competitiveness and limiting American economic opportunities;
adumbrate US military advantages; undercut US credibility and prestige;
and weaken US alliances in East Asia or beyond.55 Furthermore, recent
Chinese actions in and around East Asia seemingly give credence to such
concerns. After all, the last decade has witnessed China take an
increasingly assertive stance in its maritime disputes in the South and
East China Seas56 ; enact an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over
the East China Sea57 ; make political and economic inroads into Central
Asia and Africa58 ; influence the domestic politics of Asia-Pacific
states to favour pro-China policies; and expand its defence budget.59
Concurrently, trade tensions with the United States are rising, and the
Chinese government has tried to buttress its authority by cracking down
on domestic opponents.60

China's current strategy: Mixed

**[It is too early]{.underline}**, however, **[to declare Chinese
predation a fact]{.underline}**, [just as there are reasons to question
whether Chinese predation is likely in the future]{.underline}. [On one
level, and consistent with research]{.underline} by scholars such as
Avery Goldstein, Alastair Iain Johnston and others, [there are
**less-competitive elements** **embedded**]{.underline} [in current
Chinese strategy]{.underline}.61 **[Chinese land
reclamation]{.underline}** and military deployments **[in the
East]{.underline}** and South [China Seas]{.underline}, [for instance,
have mostly involved territories **previously claimed** by the Chinese
government]{.underline} -- **[China has not expanded its maritime
claims]{.underline}** [so much as **taken a unilateral approach towards
resolving existing disputes**.]{.underline}62 [Similarly, **China's
ADIZ** move **came after Japan expanded its own ADIZ** and began
consolidating control over the disputed Senkaku Islands]{.underline}.63

[It is also important to recognise]{.underline} that [there are steps
China **could** plausibly **have undertaken**]{.underline} in recent
years **[yet chose not to]{.underline}**. [Despite concerns
over]{.underline} a [Chinese military build-up]{.underline}, for
instance, [China did not increase]{.underline} [the share of state
wealth allocated to military spending]{.underline}; military
expenditures have remained at 1.9 per cent of Chinese gross domestic
product (GDP) since 2009.64 Likewise, [China has sustained a
**minimalist** nuclear deterrent]{.underline} [even though this force is
vulnerable to disruption]{.underline}.65 [Above all,]{.underline}
**[China has not tried to form an anti-US alliance]{.underline}** in
East Asia -- [in fact, there is some evidence that China has **sought to
keep the United States engaged**]{.underline} in East Asia **[rather
than exclude it]{.underline}**.66 For example, [not only
did]{.underline} Chinese President Xi Jinping tell US President Barack
Obama in 2014 that the 'Pacific Ocean has ample space to accommodate our
two great nations,' but China's Xinhua news agency greeted Donald
Trump's election -- after a campaign marked by calls for a reduced US
role in the world -- with a warning against US isolationism.67 **[These
moves are not consistent with a predatory campaign]{.underline}**:
[China is pursuing a mixed strategy]{.underline} [that blends both
cooperative and competitive elements]{.underline}.

Of course, it is possible that [Chinese strategy may give
way]{.underline} to predation in the future. [Still]{.underline}, the
approach developed above highlights that [China's future course will
ultimately depend]{.underline} [upon China's threat
environment]{.underline} and the constraints and opportunities this
imposes. And on this basis, [a series of **quantitative**]{.underline}
and qualitative [indicators provides room for **cautious
optimism**]{.underline} [that China **will at worst continue its mixed
strategy**]{.underline} vis-à-vis the United States. As importantly,
[there are reasons that China may]{.underline} -- under certain
conditions -- [adopt a supportive strategy]{.underline}. The logic here
is simple: [not only is China's]{.underline} threat
[environment]{.underline} [such that it is far from clear whether the
PRC **would be able to systematically challenge**]{.underline} the
United States [without **significantly harming its
security**]{.underline}, [but China faces competitors besides the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Combined, these factors should
give China pause before pursuing a predatory course, and may even offer
ground for supporting the United States.

#### China rise is peaceful

of War: How a Robust Marketplace and Liberal Hegemony Are Leading to
Perpetual World Peace." *International Security* 44(1): 160-196.

[The rise of China]{.underline} has [sparked fear in some]{.underline}
American [thinkers]{.underline} and policymakers [who
believe]{.underline} that [power equals threat and changes in relative
power result in conflict and]{.underline} war.69 I argue, however, that
such [fear is **unwarranted**]{.underline} unless China has a status
economy; status powers have an interest in sowing chaos wherever they
lack control, which is diametrically opposed to the contractualist
preference for order and self-determination. [China]{.underline},
however, [has neither a status nor a contractualist economy, but an
**axial economy**]{.underline} (see table 1). [As the world\'s largest
exporter with considerable public and private trading sectors, China
possesses an economy not unlike those of ancient Athens, the Italian
city-states of the Renaissance, and the European kingdoms of the
Enlightenment]{.underline}. [The **elites** of those
societies]{.underline}, like China\'s today, [embraced **long-distance
commerce**]{.underline}.

[Axial states can wage wars over global markets]{.underline}. Historical
examples include the Venetian-Genoese wars of the early Italian
Renaissance, the Anglo-Dutch wars of the second half of the seventeenth
century, and the Anglo-French wars of the eighteenth century. [These
wars were fought for **control of markets** and maritime trade routes,
**not global leadership**]{.underline}. As discussed above, elites in
axial economies perceive little interest in the welfare of strangers and
thus non-discriminatory trade.

The last time a leading contractualist power dealt with an
axial-capitalist peer competitor was in the nineteenth century. In the
decades before World War I, axial Britain was in the process of
transitioning toward a contractualist economy (see table 1). In the
first decade of this century, axial China was moving rapidly toward
becoming a contractualist economy.70 The parallels are uncanny: both
countries wildly embraced trade, but with a mix of normal and
mercantilist arrangements. Although both China today and Britain then
had normal trade relations with many countries, both had, or continue to
have, discriminatory relations in other spheres: just as British
merchants had privileged access to the markets of many of Britain\'s
colonies and Dominions and used military force to collect debts, [China
today seeks privileges for its state-owned enterprises in its internal
market and abroad and imposes harsh terms on states that fail to pay
their debts]{.underline}.71

Similarly, [just like Britain a century ago, China today appears to be
increasingly acting as if it has an **interest in the global market
order**]{.underline}. Late-nineteenth-century Britain provided the world
a trading currency by backing the pound sterling with gold, and British
bankers financed projects all over the globe. [Recently, China **ceased
undervaluing the yuan**]{.underline}, [indicating that it has an
interest in the health of economies beyond its borders, and is now
providing as much financing to developing countries as the World
Bank]{.underline}.72

[Just as the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Britain managed to avoid serious
militarized conflict, so too can the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
China]{.underline}. **[Negotiated solutions]{.underline}** [are possible
because]{.underline}, like Britain, [China has an **interest in the
global market order**]{.underline}. [Despite its rise, China has become
**far friendlier** to its neighbors and others than it was as a status
power]{.underline}, when it fomented revolution abroad under the
leadership of Mao Zedong. [China has **resolved most of its territorial
disputes**]{.underline}.73 Largely, only its maritime disputes are
ongoing, and these are not new, having originated in the pre-communist
period.74 In recent years, [China has **established diplomatic
relations** with many countries it once treated as enemies, including
**Indonesia**, **Singapore**, and **South Korea**]{.underline}.75

Other aspects of Lim and Ikenberry's analysis should be approached more
critically. First, [thinking in terms of]{.underline} **[rival
international hegemonic orders]{.underline}**---[one]{.underline}
**[American]{.underline}**-led [and]{.underline} liberal,
[one]{.underline} **[Chinese]{.underline}**-led and
illiberal---[obscures the commonalities that both powers share and makes
it]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** [to account for
the]{.underline} **[institutional complexity]{.underline}** [of the
contemporary power shift]{.underline}. [Neither the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [nor]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [is a]{.underline} **[consistent]{.underline}**
[upholder of the]{.underline} current [international order, and both
powers display]{.underline} **[dissatisfaction]{.underline}** [with the
structures, practices, and social purposes of]{.underline} many of [its
established institutions]{.underline}. An alternative approach is to
[think about China's order-building activities]{.underline} **[less as
an alternative]{.underline}** hegemonic **[system]{.underline}** [than
as a layered order on top of an already institutionalized,
but]{.underline} **[increasingly]{.underline}** [contested, status
quo]{.underline}. This would also highlight the deep overlaps and
interactions between US-led and China-led orders. Second, Lim and
Ikenberry's ideal-typical approach to [theorizing]{.underline}
**[Chinese]{.underline}** international **[order-building]{.underline}**
largely [ignores the role that China has]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** [played in building]{.underline} actually
**[existing institutions]{.underline}** [of international
order]{.underline}. While their ideal-typical model offers an
interesting thought experiment into the nature of a hypothetical Chinese
hegemony, [a]{.underline} **[more empirical]{.underline}** [approach
reveals a more]{.underline} **[differentiated]{.underline}** [picture of
Chinese order-building characterized by]{.underline} institutional
**[overlap]{.underline}**, **[interaction]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} forces of **[convergence]{.underline}** as well as
divergence. This highlights the limits of Lim and Ikenberry's
hypothetical approach to hegemony.

The Institutional Complexity of the Contemporary Power Shift

The traditional approach to international hegemonic order-building
assumes a largely clear space upon which hegemonic orders can be
constructed.3 The key mechanism behind the creation of such clear spaces
is hegemonic war. Scholars view such wars as loosening constraints on
action and creating new distributions of power which facilitate "the
rebuilding of order after major wars."4 Yet, [the]{.underline}
**[current shift]{.underline}** [in international power]{.underline} has
**[not]{.underline}** (praise be) **[give]{.underline}**n
**[rise]{.underline}** [to a hegemonic war]{.underline}, and any effort
at hegemonic order-building needs to depart from an already
institutionalized international order.

Lim and Ikenberry acknowledge this reality when they note that "\[[t\]he
absence of a]{.underline} great-power **[war]{.underline}** [and the
continuing]{.underline} global **[presence]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[makes a]{.underline} clean **[break]{.underline}** and a fresh start
[impossible]{.underline}."5 But they regard the absence of a clean slate
primarily as a methodological challenge to divining what a Chinese-led
international order would look like under ideal conditions. They largely
set aside the issue of how well their ideal type [describes
the]{.underline} messy **[empirical reality]{.underline}**, [which is an
outcome not only of]{.underline} **[China's preferences]{.underline}**
[but of the]{.underline} **[constraints]{.underline}** [of existing
structures and the actions and reactions of other states and
actors]{.underline}.6 This is a missed opportunity for exploring the
institutional complexity of the contemporary power shift.

First, while there is much truth to the claim that
**[China]{.underline}** has [emerged in a global order that]{.underline}
**[embodies]{.underline}** [a liberal social purpose deriving from
prolonged]{.underline} **[Western dominance]{.underline}**,7 it would be
a [gross oversimplification to assume]{.underline} that the United
States is the upholder of liberal international order while
**[China]{.underline}** [is seeking to]{.underline}
**[revise]{.underline}** or replace [it]{.underline}.8 Lim and Ikenberry
acknowledge this complexity but neither engage with it nor integrate it
into their theorizing. Putting aside conceptual objections that the very
notion of a singular liberal international order obscures more than it
reveals,9 numerous [scholars have shown how both the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [reject some aspects of]{.underline} established
[institutions and norms while supporting others]{.underline}.10 For
example, while China rejects traditional liberal interpretations of
human rights, [it]{.underline} **[consistently signals]{.underline}**
[support for the authority of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[S]{.underline}**ecurity
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil.11 Likewise, while the United States largely
supports institutions where it enjoys institutional privileges, such as
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, it frequently challenges
other rules and institutions associated with liberal international
order, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations
Human Rights Council.12 At times it has even challenged some of the most
basic norms of international society, such as the peaceful settlement of
disputes.13 The [partial and selective support of]{.underline} both
[major powers for]{.underline} **[existing]{.underline}** [international
institutions]{.underline} **[significantly complicates]{.underline}**
[the picture of an]{.underline} **[illiberal great power]{.underline}**
[rising up in a liberal order dominated by a liberal
hegemon]{.underline}. Both China and the United States can act as
challengers to or defenders of established order, depending on the issue
at stake.

Second, [the existence of a]{.underline} **[pre-existing institutional
order]{.underline}** [changes the]{.underline} **[incentive
structure]{.underline}** [for a rising China to engage in]{.underline}
**[alternative]{.underline}** [order-building]{.underline}. Lim and
Ikenberry make an important point when they state that the [Chinese
state seeks to make the international environment]{.underline} **[more
amenable]{.underline}** [to its]{.underline} domestic [governance
arrangements]{.underline}. Yet [this]{.underline} **[does
not]{.underline}** necessarily **[require]{.underline}** [the
construction of an alternative international orde]{.underline}r. Rather,
[the promotion of]{.underline} **[new]{.underline}** [norms and
institutions takes place]{.underline} **[alongside]{.underline}**
[attempts to bring established practices and institutions]{.underline}
more closely **[in]{.underline}**to **[line]{.underline}** [with China's
preferences]{.underline}. The case of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) highlights that rather than institutional
"creation" being an alternative choice to institutional "change",14 both
strategies can be pursued simultaneously. The [different strategies
are]{.underline} often **[complementary]{.underline}**, as both the
threat and actual creation of additional institutions can increase
leverage over existing ones. The [fact that China confronts
an]{.underline} **[already strongly]{.underline}** [institutionalized
international order]{.underline} **[limits]{.underline}** both
[the]{.underline} **[incentives]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the
**[capacity]{.underline}** [for China to construct an alternative
order]{.underline}. Under conditions of uncertainty, resource scarcity,
and satisficing rather than maximizing, [the promotion of an alternative
Chinese order seems]{.underline} **[less likely]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} the **[piecemeal]{.underline}** [layering of
additional institutions onto existing ones]{.underline}.15

Third, [conceptualizing an]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}**
[Chinese order]{.underline} in ideal-typical terms
**[downplays]{.underline}** [the extent to which different orders
overlap and interact]{.underline}. Institutional overlap exists when two
or more institutions share both policy tasks and membership.16
[Hegemonic orders can]{.underline} **[overlap]{.underline}** in a
similar manner. Lim and Ikenberry are probably correct to argue that
authoritarian governments will find China's approach to international
cooperation attractive as it neutralizes challenges to their political
legitimacy and offers pragmatic benefits. Yet, [there is]{.underline}
also **[significant evidence]{.underline}** [that Chinese order-building
attracts followers]{.underline} **[regardless]{.underline}** [of regime
type]{.underline}. For example, more than half of the membership of the
(China-led) AIIB are also members of the (US- and Japan-led) Asian
Development Bank, and both institutions are nested within the broader
membership of the World Bank Group. [Few countries see]{.underline}
these [institutions as]{.underline} **[mutually
exclusive]{.underline}**, [even as each]{.underline} institution
[exhibits]{.underline} **[different]{.underline}** normative and policy
[priorities]{.underline}.17 Although the United States government has
made some effort to propagate a democratic/authoritarian divide as a new
ideological cleavage in international order, one [study
found]{.underline} **[no evidence]{.underline}** [that regime type or
domestic human rights practices played a role in]{.underline}
**[shaping]{.underline}** [states' participation in]{.underline}
**[China's Belt and Road Forum]{.underline}** for International
Cooperation.18 Several countries typically seen as key members of the
American hegemonic order, such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and
South Korea, are already more economically dependent on China than with
any other country.19 India, a major emerging power, insists on its
strategic autonomy and combines membership of the China-led Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO) with membership in the US-led
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). The [existence of a large degree
of overlap]{.underline} **[complicates]{.underline}** [the idea of
an]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}** [China-led
order]{.underline} **[strengthening illiberalism]{.underline}**, [and
highlights the degree of integration and overlap]{.underline} between
different orders, each of which can reflect different social purposes
and varying degrees of American or Chinese leadership.

### Russia D

#### Russia won't use nukes -- cost is too high

**Baklitskiy, Carnegie Politika nuclear policy and arms control expert,
7-20-23**

\[Andrey, 7-20-23, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "What We
Learned From Recent Calls for a Russian Nuclear Attack",
<https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/90232>, accessed 8-21-23, AFB\]

[The recent public discussion in Russia on using nuclear weapons against
the West was **really a discussion** about how Moscow can extricate
itself from the difficult situation in which it finds
itself]{.underline}---and what price it is willing to pay for a victory.

Does Russia have the right to carry out a nuclear first strike, and has
the time come to launch one? These questions have been the subject of
recent public discussion in Russia---unprecedented in tone and
content---right up to the level of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The world has learned nothing new about Russia's nuclear arsenal, the
conditions Moscow sees as necessary for going nuclear, or the chances of
this happening. Instead, the discussion became one about Russia's
current position in the world.

It was Sergei [Karaganov, honorary chairman of Russia's Council on
Foreign and Defense Policy]{.underline}, who [kicked off the
debate.]{.underline} In an article published in the middle of June, [he
contended that "this military operation \[in Ukraine\] cannot end with a
decisive victory without forcing the West to retreat strategically, or
even surrender." Therefore, he said, it is necessary to scare the West
with Russia's willingness to use nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and then
possibly "hit a bunch of targets in a number of countries in order to
bring those who have lost their mind to reason." Karaganov summarized
his point by saying that, in a war, the winners are not judged.

Previous calls to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine have been made by
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev
also regularly hints at such a scenario. But [the direct advocation of a
nuclear war by Karaganov---a member of Russia's mainstream expert
community---obliged other members of that community to weigh
in]{.underline}.

[The opinions of most other experts can be gleaned from the titles of
their articles]{.underline}: "A Preemptive Nuclear Strike? No!," "[Why
We Won't Be Able to Sober Up the West with a Nuclear Bomb," and "Nuclear
War Is a Bad Way to Solve a Problem." One argued that Russia could
achieve all its goals with conventional weapons and that Karaganov's
proposal only played into the hands of the West; another highlighted the
unpredictable consequences and unacceptable costs of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} The only significant public figure to support
Karaganov was Dmitry Trenin, a professor at Moscow's Higher School of
Economics and the former director of the now-closed Carnegie Moscow
Center.

[Even Putin waded into the debate on the use of tactical nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Answering a question at the plenary session of the
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, [Putin said: "First, we see
no need to use them, and, second, considering this even as a possibility
factors into lowering the threshold for the use of such
weapons."]{.underline}

[Indeed, analysis of the texts penned by the first strike proponents
reveals that they are actually]{.underline} **[seeking a way
out]{.underline}** [for Russia from the difficult position in which it
finds itself in Ukraine]{.underline}. Trenin, for example, wrote that
"nuclear deterrence, which many in Moscow relied on as an effective
means of ensuring the vital interests of the country, has turned out to
have much more limited uses." That's a fair point.

Russia's nuclear power status does of course restrain the West from
direct intervention in Ukraine (although it's unclear whether, even
without that deterrent, Western countries would want that). But it in no
way prevents them from supporting Kyiv with arms, intelligence,
training, and sanctions.

[By and large, Western countries do not assess the likelihood of Russia
using nuclear weapons as high]{.underline}. [They believe it would mean
many deaths, the destruction of infrastructure, and, perhaps most
significantly, massive reputational damage for the Russian authorities.
Nor is it a given that a nuclear strike would help Russia achieve its
goals]{.underline}. Either way, the risks of escalation and a nuclear
response would be very high.

[It's calculations of this sort that explain why nuclear weapons have
not been used on the battlefield since 1945]{.underline}. [Instead,
their use has been reserved for exceptional circumstances, when the very
existence of a state is threatened. The question is, what exactly are
"exceptional circumstances?"]{.underline}

[The West mostly refuses to believe that, for Moscow, those
circumstances could be military defeat and a return to the borders of
2014 (before the annexation of Crimea) on the basis that if Russia
existed within those borders before, it can do so again. This logic is
backed up by the fact that after Putin pledged he would use "any means"
to maintain the country's territorial integrity following the annexation
of four Ukrainian regions last year, he then approved Russia's retreat
from Kherson, the capital of one of those regions]{.underline}.

[The Russian leadership is obviously struggling to find a way in which
nuclear threats could strengthen its position in Ukraine and give it an
edge in the confrontation with the West.]{.underline} The Russian
Foreign Ministry, for example, regularly states that a military
escalation could trigger a nuclear war. But it is unable to provide any
details on the chain of events that would lead to such an outcome.

[Indeed, most in the West believe the nuclear threat from Russia is
insignificant. If Karaganov wanted to be taken seriously, he needed---at
the very least---to explain why a nuclear outcome was desirable for
Russia. Yet that part of his article was severely lacking.]{.underline}

Karaganov had nothing to say about the targets of a nuclear strike, the
conditions for taking a decision to go nuclear, or Moscow's famous "red
lines." [All he has are contentious claims that the use of a nuclear
weapon would force the West to back down.]{.underline}

[Upon closer inspection, the nuclear weapons discussion is actually a
discussion about whether there are more important things for Russia, its
leaders, and its people than winning a war with the West. In the world
described by Karaganov and Trenin, the answer is "no."]{.underline} They
see the standoff with the West as existential and argue that, as Moscow
has fewer resources than its enemies, a first strike is logical.

[This position is not just unacceptable to Russian nuclear policy
experts, however]{.underline}, but also---as far as it is possible to
judge---[to the Russian leadership.]{.underline} [On top of the obvious
counterarguments and risks, there is an understanding that Russia has
other national interests and that, while the current situation is
unpleasant, it shows no sign of leading to the country's total
destruction---unlike the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[Advocates of a nuclear first strike like Karaganov and Trenin have not
only failed to scare their foreign opponents, but, as the recent
discussion illustrates, have not even succeeded in winning over their
colleagues. Ordinary Russians are likely similarly opposed:]{.underline}
a recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center revealed that
[86 percent of Russians believe nuclear weapons should not be used in
Ukraine under any circumstances.]{.underline}

#### Russia threats are hollow -- international condemnation checks Russian nuclear use

**Kimball, Arms Control Association executive director, 23**

\[Daryl G., January/February 2023, Arms Control Association, "The
Nuclear Taboo Remains Strong for Now",
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2023-01/focus/nuclear-taboo-remains-strong-now>,
accessed 8-21-23, AFB\]

Even before his disastrous decision to invade Ukraine last year, Russian
President Vladimir Putin had demonstrated a malign indifference toward
basic norms of international behavior, an uneven record of compliance
with cornerstone arms control agreements, and a penchant for bullying
and using deadly force against opponents.

Nevertheless, it was still shocking that, [at the outset of the war,
Putin issued veiled but unmistakable threats that he might use nuclear
weapons]{.underline} against anyone, particularly the United States or
NATO, trying to interfere in his unprovoked assault on independent,
non-nuclear-armed Ukraine. When Putin hinted on Sept. 21 that he might
use short-range nuclear weapons in the conflict, many feared that the
unthinkable might happen.

[Yet, Putin eventually was compelled to back off his nuclear threats.
"We see no need for that," he said in October. "There is no point in
that, neither political nor military."]{.underline}

[This rhetorical retreat was no accident. Undoubtedly, Putin was
reminded by his advisers and by U.S. and NATO leaders that there is no
military value in using nuclear weapons against Ukrainian targets.
Instead of ending the war, such an atrocity would draw NATO into the
conflict, bringing about Russia's defeat and Putin's own downfall.
Another major, perhaps decisive, factor was the crescendo of global
condemnation against nuclear threats of any kind from non-nuclear-armed
states and later from nuclear-armed states, as well as Russia's few
remaining enablers.]{.underline}

To his credit, U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline} did not issue
reciprocal threats against Russia. He reaffirmed that U.S. and NATO
forces would not become engaged directly in the war. He also [made clear
that he would not be intimidated by Putin's nuclear "warnings" and would
provide the assistance needed to help Ukrainians defend their country.
This took the punch out of Putin's threats and helped ensure that the
Russian nuclear bully did not get his way.]{.underline}

But early in the war, Biden referred to Russia's "occasional nuclear
rhetoric" as "dangerous and extremely irresponsible," implying that some
nuclear threats are responsible. In July, France, the United Kingdom,
and the United States expanded on this theme in a joint paper saying
they reject "irresponsible rhetoric concerning potential nuclear use
intended for military coercion, intimidation, or blackmail." They
asserted that their nuclear weapons only "serve defensive purposes,
deter aggression and prevent war." Not surprisingly, Russian officials
claimed Putin's nuclear warnings were "defensive" and designed to deter
Western interference.

In contrast, [many leaders from non-nuclear-weapon states recognized
that following Putin's brazen threats, the world needed to speak with
greater clarity to avert nuclear catastrophe, and they did. In June, the
65 states-parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
issued a political statement noting that "any use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons is a violation of international law]{.underline},
including the Charter of the United Nations" [and condemning
"unequivocally any and all nuclear threats,]{.underline} whether they be
explicit or implicit and irrespective of the circumstances." [At the
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review conference in August, 147
non-nuclear-weapon states declared the use of nuclear weapons
unacceptable "under any circumstances."]{.underline}

Then, following Putin's alarming threat of possibly using short-range
nuclear weapons to decimate Ukraine's army or its cities, global concern
about nuclear war rose to levels not seen in decades. [Key leaders began
to speak out in more direct terms.]{.underline}

[Borrowing from the terminology of the non-nuclear-weapon states, NATO
Secretary-General]{.underline} Jens [Stoltenberg stated]{.underline} on
Sept. 27 that ["any use of nuclear weapons is absolutely
unacceptable."]{.underline} German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared on
Oct. 8, "We need to give a clear answer to nuclear threats. They're
dangerous for the world, and the use of nuclear weapons is
unacceptable."

[More importantly, leaders who had been silent about Putin's nuclear
threats finally weighed in. On Nov. 4, Chinese President Xi Jinping said
the international community should "jointly oppose the use of, or
threats to use, nuclear weapons."]{.underline} The powerful Group of 20
agreed on Nov. 16 at their summit in Indonesia that threats and use of
nuclear weapons are "inadmissible."

[The Putin-provoked nuclear crisis forced millions of people, including
many world leaders, to confront the grim realities of nuclear weapons
for the first time]{.underline}: that even their limited use likely
would trigger nuclear escalation with global consequences; that their
use is immoral and illegal; and that nuclear deterrence, a strategy that
depends on the credible threat of nuclear use, is dangerous,
unsustainable, and ultimately unacceptable.

#### Russian nuclear use unlikely -- Multiple intelligence assessments prove

**Bugos, Arms Control Today, 23**

\[Shannon, June 2023, Arms Control Today, "Russian Use of Nuclear
Weapons Still Unlikely, U.S. Says",
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2023-06/news/russian-use-nuclear-weapons-still-unlikely-us-says>,
accessed 8-21-23, AFB\]

[Ahead of a widely expected counteroffensive by Ukraine in its war with
Russia, the U.S. intelligence community continues to assert that the
likelihood of]{.underline} Russian President [Vladimir Putin using
nuclear weapons in the war remains low.]{.underline}

["It is very unlikely" that Russia would employ nuclear weapons,
Director of National Intelligence]{.underline} Avril [Haines told
Congress]{.underline} during a May 4 hearing.

[Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who
also testified at the hearing, agreed with Haines,]{.underline} but
added that, "in the nature of conflict, there is always that
possibility" of nuclear weapons use.

[The assessment followed Russia's suspension]{.underline} in February
[of]{.underline} the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty [(New
START),]{.underline} the last Russian-U.S. nuclear arms control
agreement still standing. (See ACT, March 2023.) Moscow has conditioned
a resumption of the treaty and its associated activities, such as
on-site inspections and detailed data exchanges, on Washington
withdrawing support from Kyiv.

"Russia's decision to suspend the \[New\] START may be reversible," the
Russian Foreign Ministry said in an April 20 statement. "However, for
this, the United States must show political will and abandon its
aggressive policy of undermining the security of our country, taking
practical steps towards a real de-escalation."

[Despite the Russian suspension, the United States has continued to
provide broad unclassified data on its strategic nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. In this year's first biannual data exchange,
Washington reported that it deploys 1,419 warheads on 662 delivery
vehicles, roughly the same data as in September. (See ACT, November
2022.)

["The United States continues to view transparency among nuclear weapon
states as extremely valuable for reducing the likelihood of
misperception, miscalculation, and costly arms competitions," the State
Department said]{.underline} in a statement accompanying the publication
of the data on May 12.

[Russia and the United States have emphasized that they will continue to
adhere to an ongoing 1988 Soviet-U.S. agreement that requires the two
nations to exchange notifications of launches of intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
Russia also expressed its intention to continue adhering to a 1989
Soviet-U.S. agreement that requires advance notification of major
strategic exercises.]{.underline}

#### No Russia war -- they won't risk it

Amy F. **Woolf 20**, Specialist in Nuclear Weapons Policy in the Foreign
Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research
Service at the Library of Congress, received a Master's in Public Policy
from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1983,
"Russia's Nuclear Weapons: Doctrine, Forces, and Modernization",
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf>

One analyst has postulated that [Russia may actually]{.underline}
**[raise its nuclear threshold]{.underline}** [as it
bolsters]{.underline} its [conventional forces]{.underline}. According
to this analyst, "[It is **difficult to understand** why]{.underline}
[Russia would want to pursue **military adventurism**]{.underline} [that
would risk **all-out confrontation**]{.underline} [with a
**technologically advanced and nuclear-armed adversary like
NATO**]{.underline}. [While]{.underline}
**[opportunistic]{.underline}**, [and possibly even
**reckless**]{.underline}, [the Putin regime **does not appear to be
suicidal**]{.underline}." 144 [As a study from]{.underline} the
[RAND]{.underline} Corporation [noted]{.underline}, [Russia has
"invested considerable sums in developing and fielding long-range
conventional strike weapons since the mid-2000s to provide Russian
leadership with a **buffer** against]{.underline} **[reaching the
nuclear threshold]{.underline}**---[a set of conventional escalatory
options that can achieve strategic effects **without resorting to
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}."145 Others note, however, that Russia
has integrated these "conventional precision weapons and nuclear weapons
into a single strategic weapon set," lending credence to the view that
Russia may be prepared to employ, or threaten to employ, nuclear weapons
during a regional conflict.

### No Food Wars

**No [food wars]{.underline} AND war [turns]{.underline} insecurity.**

Dr. Maureen J. **Purcell 24**, PhD, MA, Postdoctoral Researcher, UCI
Blum Center for Poverty Alleviation. Former Lecturer, Environmental Law,
California State University, Long Beach, \"Book Review: Food or War,\"
Environment & Security, Vol. 2, Issue 2, 01/09/2024, SAGE. \[italics in
original\]

A criticism of *Food or war* is that the titular argument that food has
a role in the *genesis* of conflict becomes muddled with the positive
feedback loop argument couched within the food--war nexus Cribb
describes. The former [seems to neglect the]{.underline} **[role of
conflict]{.underline}** [in causing]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[hunger]{.underline}** [crises]{.underline},
emphasizing only a **[one-way relationship]{.underline}** [from food
crisis to war]{.underline}. This is not to say that Cribb does not
present both pathways of this nexus---he does and in compelling
fashion---but rather that the [evidence supports a]{.underline} slightly
**[different]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more
cyclical]{.underline}** [hypothesis than the central
thesis]{.underline}.

Similarly, [in emphasizing the]{.underline} inarguably important **[role
of food]{.underline}** [in relationship to]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}**, [other variables]{.underline}
**[critical]{.underline}** [for understanding the conflict cycle are
ignored]{.underline}. [Full bellies]{.underline} **[do not premise
utopia]{.underline}** [as Cribb seems to]{.underline}
**[extrapolate]{.underline}** from his material. A [well-fed populace
is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [one without]{.underline}
**[ideological]{.underline}**, **[moral]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
**[political]{.underline}** [differences---all of which have been
implicated in the conflict cycle]{.underline}. At times Cribb [likens
food stress to]{.underline} **["tinder"]{.underline}** (e.g., pp.
140--141, 149), [which would suggest]{.underline}, perhaps more
appropriately, that [the state of the food system is a]{.underline}
**[necessary but not sufficient element of initiating
conflict]{.underline}**. While the argument posited is never that food
is the only cause, [the]{.underline} **[other
contributors]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[rarely]{.underline}**
[if at all mentioned]{.underline}, leaving the non-expert reader without
a sense of what else contributes to this complex issue.

Finally, while the main argument is persuasive (if at times muddled)
some statements would benefit from supporting evidence while others
would specifically be better supported by scientific evidence rather
than popular science journalism or news media. This is particularly true
of each instance in which the female gender is ascribed particular
personality traits in universal fashion in apparent disregard for
feminist critiques of stereotyping. Trying to anticipate this very
critique, Cribb states, "This isn't gender stereotyping. It's an
observation about how different kinds of humans think" (2018, p. 201),
which does not offer the credibility to his argument that he thinks it
does. From a science communication perspective, the [mixing
of]{.underline} **[scientifically supported and unsupported
claims]{.underline}** [at times makes it]{.underline}
**[difficult]{.underline}** [to determine what is a]{.underline}
**[tested]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[true]{.underline}**
[understanding and what is]{.underline} Cribb's
**[personal]{.underline}** [perspective]{.underline}.

#### Wars [aren't]{.underline} fought over food.

[The line of argument of]{.underline} both the
[environmental]{.underline} security school and [collapse
theorist]{.underline}, at least with regard to agriculture-dependent
developing countries, [follows this chain of **causation**]{.underline},
loosely adapted from the critical discussion by Peluso and Watts \[26\]
(p. 17): [climate change → food crisis → heightened competition →
breakdown of social order]{.underline} (1)where "climate change" is one
instance of adverse environmental change, and food crisis stands for the
social effects of environmental scarcity. [There is a **severe
disconnect**]{.underline} [between the **body of
knowledge**]{.underline} [produced by **scholars of famine** and food
insecurity, and the **environmental security** school]{.underline}, as
well as climate collapse theorists. The latter tend to ignore the rich
historical evidence on the character, societal context, political
economy, and anthropology of large-scale devastating food crises. As
will be elaborated in the following, [contemporary famine scholars are
**fairly unanimous**]{.underline} [that (a) drought]{.underline} and
other severe climatic disasters [are not necessarily the]{.underline}
**[main factors]{.underline}** [leading to famines]{.underline}, even if
it appears that way, since [(b) famines have a **political
context**]{.underline} [that is often]{.underline} **[more
important]{.underline}** [than other factors]{.underline}; in addition,
(c) famines and the distribution of suffering reflect social hierarchies
within the afflicted societies, and [(d) even **large-scale** famines do
not **necessarily**]{.underline} [lead to a **complete
collapse**]{.underline} [of a polity's functioning]{.underline}, as (e)
food systems are highly interconnected and complex. These five
statements will now be discussed in turn. Agricultural drought---the
insufficient availability of water, or, more precisely, soil moisture,
for crop cultivation---is among the most frequent causes of yield
failure and may lead to food insecurity crises, and in the most extreme,
famine. [Drought years are **recurrent**]{.underline} [in water-stressed
**regions**]{.underline} and countries. [There are **manifold** coping
strategies to drought on the **household level**]{.underline} [pursued
by **rural people**]{.underline} [and subsistence-farming
households,]{.underline} including, but not confined to, using up
supplies on stock, taking up debt, leaving out meals, [making use of
"famine food"]{.underline}, searching for off-farm work, [selling
land]{.underline}, farm animals and valuable items, [and temporal
migration]{.underline} (i.e., to distant relatives) \[62,63,64,65,66\].
In a number of regional contexts, there is also the phenomenon of
seasonal hunger \[67,68\], essentially a coping strategy to get by with
scarce food resource over the year. On the level of famine management
and mitigation by state authorities or international donors, [famine
relief in the form of **humanitarian emergency** food aid is **often
applied**; additional measures include **food price stabilization** and
**bans on exports**]{.underline} \[69,70\]. Although these interventions
have their own setbacks \[71\], food aid and other famine management
measures are much more preferable for the avoidance of high mortality
rates than neglect and lack of response on the side of the governing
authorities, as historic examples show \[72,73\]. [Mid-term
strategies]{.underline} for prevention of drought-famine
[include]{.underline} **[technological interventions]{.underline}**,
[such as investments]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[irrigation
infrastructures]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[landscaping]{.underline}** [against soil erosion]{.underline} [or
introduction of]{.underline} **[famine-resistant]{.underline}** [crop
varieties]{.underline} \[74\], or governance intervention, such as the
implementation of social security systems and public health care, and
instatement of early warning systems \[75,76\]. Hence, [drought-famines
are not **mere natural disasters**]{.underline}, [but represent a
failure of]{.underline} **[policies]{.underline}** and institutions.
This points to the political nature of large-scale food crises.
Furthermore, food insecurity crises often arise in the context of armed
conflict and interstate wars, a statement which does not only apply to
organized violence in the 20th century but holds true to these days.
Table 1 lists major famines from 1917--2018; climatic aspects are in the
foreground for a number of modern famines, yet the context of armed
conflict is present in a large number of cases. **[Strong
evidence]{.underline}** [of authoritarian politics as a **direct
cause**]{.underline} [of devastating famine]{.underline} can be found in
the Stalinist famine (Holodomor) in 1930s Soviet Ukraine \[77,78\] and
the Great Leap Forward famine in the People's Republic of China
(1958--1962) \[79,80\]. The latter is arguably the most lethal hunger
catastrophe in history in terms of victims' number quantity. Hunger is
weaponized by aggressors against unwanted populations; the Siege of
Leningrad (1941--1944) by Nazi Germany is a historical example \[81\].
The strong interrelation between organized violence and large-scale food
crises leads Alex de Waal \[82\] to speak of many modern famines as
"forced mass starvation". Having now established that
**[many]{.underline}**, [if not]{.underline} **[most]{.underline}**,
[modern famines are not the **result of drought**]{.underline} and
harvest failure alone, [but consequences of]{.underline} **[armed
conflict]{.underline}**, policy failure, [and]{.underline} **[neglecting
assistance]{.underline}** [to starving populations]{.underline}, the
question can be raised of who is suffering from famine and food crises.
The dominant view with regard to the political economy of food crises is
based on Amartya Sen's \[83\] insight that, rather than declining food
availability, the lack of ability to access food---the lack of
"entitlements" to food---was crucial in understanding the genesis of
famine. When purchasing food becomes costly, the poorer parts of a
population are suffering and starving at first. Famines are then as much
an issue of distributive justice as of food economics or agriculture
\[84\]. This "distributionist" perspective \[24\] is principally
accepted \[85\]; however, it does not appear to convince neo-Malthusians
of the fallibility of their arguments. Following these three general
arguments, it is clear that elites and upper strata of society are
generally affected by food crises to a much lesser degree than more
vulnerable populations, creating what Ó Gráda calls "hierarchies of
suffering" \[86\]. This does not preclude that famines do not have
lasting and traumatic consequences to surviving individuals and
households and to affected communities and societies, yet it raises
questions surrounding hunger crises and social stability, which have a
complex interrelation. [Acute famine is **generally not**]{.underline}
[associated with **social upheaval**]{.underline}, [as famine-affected
people are likely to be]{.underline} **[too weak]{.underline}** [to
engage in]{.underline} protest or even **[armed uprising]{.underline}**
\[73\]. Yet, there is a very robust linkage between food insecurity
crises and social unrest. The vector connecting both variables is
usually food prices. Food (price) riots are a phenomenon observed up to
the present day \[87,88,89,90\]. While [empirical evidence suggests that
**food security crises**]{.underline} [as consequence of rising food
prices]{.underline} [are neither a **necessary**]{.underline} [nor
a]{.underline} **[sufficient]{.underline}** [condition for social
unrest]{.underline}, the expectation of food insecurity can be a strong
motivator to engage in protests or riots \[91\]. In recent history, the
2010--2011 "Arab Spring" appears as a confluence of conditions where
rising food prices overlapped with radical loss of legitimacy of
authoritarian rulers and long-boiling socioeconomic tensions \[92,93\].
Here, the connection between global food price volatility and political
consequences on the national level underline the last argument: The
interdependence within the global food economy links production,
processing, and consumption through trade in international markets
\[94\]. Upstream---through trade in fertilizers, pesticides, machinery,
and irrigation technology---and downstream---food exports---commodity
chains are creating complex interdependencies \[95\].

#### Impact to food shocks is [minimal]{.underline}\-\--we're [resilient]{.underline}.

David **Frum 3/8**/22. Staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of
Trumpocalypse: Restoring American Democracy, former speechwriter for
President George W. Bush.

[Our world is much more **resilient**]{.underline} than it was even a
generation ago, especially with regard **[to food]{.underline}**. The
food shock of 2022 is not a good-news story. The news is bad. But our
"bad" is less bad than ever before.

Russia and Ukraine are massive growers of grain, especially wheat.
Russia produces about 10 percent of the planet's wheat; Ukraine about 4
percent. Some of that production is consumed at home, but after their
domestic use, Russia and Ukraine together provide about one-quarter of
all the planet's wheat exports. They are important exporters of corn and
barley as well, and of cooking oils, especially sunflower oil. Now the
Russian invasion has closed the ports through which Ukraine's wheat
moved to world markets. Insurance costs have jumped for all shipping in
the Black Sea. Spring crops will probably go unplanted in Ukraine;
Russian crops face sanctions and embargo. Russia and its ally Belarus
also are---or were---important exporters of the fertilizer that other
food-raising countries use to grow their own crops.

The upheaval will touch every food consumer on Earth, even those living
in food-secure countries such as the United States. Food prices are set
in efficient global markets. All countries face similar prices, whether
they are sellers into those markets or buyers from those markets. If the
price goes up for anyone, it goes up for everyone.

Again: Sudden increases in global food prices are not good news. But
also again: Some context is necessary. Four points of context, actually.

1\. [We live in an age of **food abundance**]{.underline}.

Maybe you retain some memory of old predictions about global famine? A
best-selling book published in 1967 carries the lurid title Famine 1975!
America's Decision: Who Will Survive? Among other predictions, the
authors identified India as the nation most inevitably doomed to mass
starvation and economic collapse.

So ... guess which country is the world's second-largest producer of
wheat in 2022, accounting for more than 13 percent of all output? That's
right, the former alleged basket case India. Since the 1960s, Indian
wheat production has increased by nearly an order of magnitude, to
almost 110 million metric tons last year. Indian wheat exports will
probably exceed 7 million metric tons this year, up from the previous
peak of 6.5 million in 2012--13.

India also exported nearly 18 million metric tons of rice in the
2020--21 marketing season, more than any other country. That's
impressive, but not as dazzling as the performance of Vietnam, which has
vaulted from exporting basically nothing as recently as 1989 to second
place among rice exporters in the 2020s. (The United States ranks
fifth.)

2\. Many [food-importing countries **can cope**]{.underline}.

[The world's largest wheat importer is Egypt]{.underline}. [I spoke with
Mirette Mabrouk, the director of the Egypt Program at the Middle East
Institute]{.underline}, in Washington, D.C. Based on my conversation
with her, [I'd characterize the food outlook for Egypt as serious but
**not critical**]{.underline}. Egyptian authorities estimate that their
[reserves will be sufficient for at least the next six months,
perhaps]{.underline} the next [nine]{.underline}. [Egyptian governments
have been in the business of managing food reserves for 5,000
years]{.underline}. From the days of Joseph's storehouses to now, they
have accumulated some considerable management capacity.

Egypt buys wheat through a system of reverse auctions: posting a tender
for a certain quantity, then accepting the lowest bid for that tender.
Since the era of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt has operated a system of
subsidized bakeries that sell low-priced loaves to qualified buyers.
More recently, Egypt has begun to convert to direct cash assistance
provided through cards that function very much like American
electronic-benefits-transfer cards. [In a crisis, the Egyptian
government can effectively provide more cash assistance to low-income
buyers]{.underline}.

This is not to minimize the shock Egypt is facing as the price of wheat
rises from a familiar \$250 or \$300 a metric ton to \$500 a metric ton.
It is to emphasize that the shock will land on state finances as much as
or more than on the Egyptian poor.

Many [other major wheat-importing countries are either rich]{.underline}
(Italy, Japan, South Korea) [or led by reasonably effective
governments]{.underline} (Indonesia, Morocco, Turkey) [that can emulate
Egypt and deliver assistance to the hard-pressed]{.underline}. The
countries to worry most about are those wracked by war and political
instability: Yemen above all, but also Ethiopia, Mali, and other
disrupted states.

3\. Global [emergency aid can help]{.underline}.

[Where famine does threaten, **the international community can save
lives**]{.underline}. [In 2021, international relief agencies provided
in-kind or cash food assistance to 13 million Yemenis]{.underline}. Such
programs will cost more in 2022, but not impossibly more. Before the war
in Ukraine, the United Nations' food program projected a Yemen aid
budget of \$2 billion for this year. That number will likely go up by 25
percent or more, but the money can be found.

An even more terrifying food crisis faces Afghanistan under its new
Taliban rulers. The Taliban's self-imposed international isolation has
been followed by a cruel drought. Millions of lives are at risk. India
has committed considerable food aid. [The war in Ukraine does not make
feeding Afghanistan's population easier, obviously, but it's only a very
**incidental aggravating factor**]{.underline}. Afghanistan's agony
would be no less agonizing if Vladimir Putin had chosen peace in Ukraine
rather than war.

4\. High prices are not bad news for everybody.

[Higher prices for food consumers mean higher incomes for food
producers. In most of the world]{.underline}, consumers hugely outnumber
producers. There is one region, however, where producers remain so
numerous that higher prices can improve the livelihoods of millions:
sub-Saharan Africa.

About two-thirds of sub-Saharan Africans farm for a living. When prices
rise, farmers produce more and earn more. Sub-Saharan farmers could
produce a lot more. African farmers could soon double or even triple
their output of grains, livestock, and other products if they use more
intense farming methods, the economic-consulting firm McKinsey
estimates.

[Higher prices could encourage African farmers to adopt more advanced
seeds and other modern methods. They could prod governments to invest
more in rail and roads in order to move crops to market]{.underline},
and to clarify property laws in order to support commercial farms that
produce for the international marketplace. Sub-Saharan food output grew
twice as fast from 2000 to 2018 as it did in the 1980--99 stretch. That
boom was driven by higher food prices, especially in the peak years of
2006 to 2013, according to a 2021 study.

[African agriculture can be **extended as well as
intensified**]{.underline}. The South African agricultural economist
Wandile Sihlobo calculates that 60 percent of the world's remaining
unused arable land is located in sub-Saharan Africa.

Higher food prices will be a stress and a burden for hundreds of
millions of people all over the world. Higher food prices will test the
stability of governments. Higher food prices may become an important
part of Russia's anti-Ukraine propaganda, which will blame Ukrainian
resistance to Russian aggression---and Western sanctions against
Russia---for the higher cost of food.

But a **[stress is not a crisis,]{.underline}** [and a crisis does not
have to be a catastrophe]{.underline}. Good management can mitigate the
stress, and begin to identify and capture opportunities. Dealing with
the food-price increases that this conflict will bring will not be easy.
But it can be done.

WALLACE-WELLS: Yeah. I mean, **[the story of the last five years has a
lot of reason for optimism. We\'re revising the sort of worst-case
scenarios out of existence.]{.underline}** But there\'s also some reason
for pessimism, which is to say that the hopeful best-case outcomes we
might have been dreaming of are no longer possible. And that means that
we are heading for a world well past climate normal and deep, you know,
sort of knee-deep, if not neck-deep, into climate disruption and
disarray. We\'re talking about 150 million additional people dying from
the effects of air pollution, from the burning of fossil fuels - 150
million. We\'re talking about flooding events that used to hit once a
century hitting many parts of the world every single year. We\'re
talking about heat waves tripling, you know, in parts of South Asia and
the Middle East, places becoming so hot during summer that, you know,
routinely, people wouldn\'t be able to walk around outside or certainly
wouldn\'t be able to work outside without risking heatstroke and,
possibly, death. **[It\'s a dramatically different world.
Now]{.underline}**, **[I don\'t think it\'s a world of,]{.underline}**
you know, **[civilizational collapse or human extinction]{.underline}**.
But it is, really, a redrawn map, which we have no analogue for in our
entire history. And as a result, I think it asks some important
questions not just about how are we going to limit warming to that
level, but what are we going to do to engineer life on the other side
that allows us to flourish in the ways that we might hope? And that is
less of a scientific question than a political question. And I think
we\'re beginning to see the climate discourse turning a little bit in
that direction.

#### Tipping points triggered in status quo---the aff's impacts are inevitable---we needed to hold the world to 1 degree and we're well past it

Spratt, 2023 (David, 4-19-2023, \"Faster than forecast, climate impacts
trigger tipping points in the Earth system\", Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,
<https://thebulletin.org/2023/04/faster-than-forecast-climate-impacts-trigger-tipping-points-in-the-earth-system/>,
DoA 9/2/2024, DVOG)

In their 2018 "hothouse" paper, **[Steffen]{.underline}** and his
colleagues **[explored the potential for self-reinforcing feedbacks to
push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed,
"could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature
rises and cause continued warming on a 'Hothouse Earth' pathway even as
human emissions are reduced]{.underline}**."

**[This challenged the notion that climate warming was a predictable,
linear consequence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases, and instead
pointed to critical thresholds, or tipping points, in which a small
change causes a larger, more critical change to be initiated, taking the
climate system as a whole or particular systems within it from one state
to a discretely different state.]{.underline}** The loss of polar
glaciers, or the Amazon rainforest drying and being replaced by
sclerophyll forest, are examples.

**[The change may be abrupt or non-linear---characterized by sudden
change rather than smooth progress---and irreversible on relevant time
frames.]{.underline}**

**[It may also lead to cascading events in which the mutual interaction
of individual climate tipping points and/or abrupt changes lead to more
profound changes to the entire system.]{.underline}** **[This is already
happening.]{.underline}** The loss of sea ice in the Arctic is adding to
regional warming, accelerating ice melt from Greenland, such that an
influx of cold, non-salty water into the North Atlantic is slowing the
Gulf Stream, which in turn is changing the Amazon climate.

**[Recent research has confirmed that tipping points and cascades are
already occurring, not at 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius of warming, but right
now]{.underline}**. In one of his last published pieces, a 2022 book
chapter, Steffen said, "it is clear from observations of climate
change-related impacts in Australia alone---the massive bushfires of the
2019-2020 Black Summer, the third mass bleaching of the Great Barrier
Reef in only five years, and long-term cool-season drying of the
country's southeast agricultural zone---that even a 1.1°C temperature
rise has put us into a dangerous level of climate change."

**[While observed warming has been close to climate model projections,
the impacts have in many instances been faster and even more extreme
than the models forecasted. William Ripple and his co-researchers show
that many positive feedbacks are not fully accounted for in climate
models]{.underline}**.

And prominent climate scientist Michael Mann says that when it comes to
certain important consequences of warming, including ice sheet collapse,
sea level rise, and the rise in extreme weather events, "the
\[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (**[IPCC)\] reports in my
view have been overly conservative, in substantial part because of
processes that are imperfectly represented in the
models."]{.underline}**

In September 2022, Stockholm University's David Armstrong McKay and his
colleagues concluded that **[even global warming of 1-degree Celsius
risks triggering some tipping points, just one data point in an alarming
mountain of research on tipping points presented in the last year and a
half.]{.underline}**

Denman Glacier, in East Antarctic, was identified as susceptible to
collapse of its ice shelf and inundation of the glacier itself, which
sits on a retrograde base below sea level. Scientists announced that the
Thwaites Glacier ice shelf in West Antarctica was fracturing and likely
to result in a speeding up of the glacier's flow and ice discharge,
possibly heralding the collapse of the glacier itself and triggering
similar increases across the Amundsen Sea glaciers. "The final collapse
of Thwaites Glacier's last remaining ice shelf may be initiated ...
within as little as five years," they said.

In November 2022, the State of the Cryosphere report concluded that
**[more than four meters of additional sea level rise was locked in
"with sections of the West Antarctic ice sheet potentially collapsing
even without any further emissions over the coming
centuries.]{.underline}**" An ingenious look at the genetic history of
Turquet's octopus and its population movement across Antarctica in past
warm periods led to the conclusion that "**[even under global heating of
1.5°C---the most ambitious goal under the global Paris climate
agreement---the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be consigned to
collapse."]{.underline}**

In August, researchers showed that **[the Arctic has warmed nearly four
times faster than the globe since 1979 and concluded it is likely
climate models systematically tend to underestimate this
amplification]{.underline}**. A few months later, scientists reported
that **[Greenland Ice Sheet glaciers are melting 100 times faster than
previously calculated. At the end of 2021, Professor Jason Box said that
the Greenland Ice Sheet has passed a tipping point: "Technically, now
\[at 1.2°C\] Greenland is beyond its viability threshold... 1.5°C would
mean the 'beyond the threshold' state is enhanced and the loss \[of ice
mass\] becomes a complex, non-linear, amplified response]{.underline}**
guaranteeing the ice sheet remains beyond its viability threshold."

**[Permafrost carbon emissions and the feedback loops they will initiate
are not accounted for in most]{.underline}** Earth system
**[models]{.underline}** or Integrated Assessment Models, including
those which informed the IPCC's special report on global warming of 1.5
degrees Celsius, **[nor are they fully accounted for in global emissions
budgets. If carbon-cycle feedbacks such as tipping points in forest
ecosystems and abrupt permafrost thaw are accounted for, the estimated
remaining budget for carbon emissions could disappear
altogether.]{.underline}**

In a ground-breaking 2021 paper, Northern Arizona University's Katharyn
Duffy and colleagues mapped the relationship between increasing
temperatures and carbon uptake in Amazon forests by analyzing more than
20 years of data on the transfer of carbon dioxide between plants, land,
and the atmosphere; their analysis showed that in recent hot periods the
thermal maximum for photosynthesis had been exceeded. At higher
temperatures, the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants
(photosynthesis) will decline sharply, whilst carbon dioxide released by
plants (respiration) will continue to rise.

In addition, **[recent evidence shows human fossil fuel emissions are
still rising and will not likely plateau until the end of this decade, a
far cry from the "carbon law," which requires halving emissions by 2030
to keep warming to under a 2-degree Celsius trajectory. Current analysis
suggests the world is heading to around 3 degrees Celsius of warming, or
perhaps 3.5 degrees Celsius in a plausible high-end
trajectory.]{.underline}**

#### Catastrophic climate change is inevitable---to survive we must shift the focus to adaptation

**Franzen, 2019** (Jonathan, 9-8-2019, \"What if We Stopped Pretending
the Climate Apocalypse Can Be Stopped?\", New Yorker,
<https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-if-we-stopped-pretending>,
DoA 9/2/2024, DVOG)

"There is infinite hope," Kafka tells us, "only not for us." This is a
fittingly mystical epigram from a writer whose characters strive for
ostensibly reachable goals and, tragically or amusingly, never manage to
get any closer to them. But it seems to me, in our rapidly darkening
world, that the converse of Kafka's quip is equally true: *There is no
hope, except for us*.

I'm talking, of course, about climate change. **[The struggle to rein in
global carbon emissions and keep the planet from melting down has the
feel of Kafka's fiction. The goal has been clear for thirty years, and
despite earnest efforts we've made essentially no progress toward
reaching it. Today, the scientific evidence verges on irrefutable. If
you're younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the
radical destabilization of life on earth---massive crop failures,
apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of
millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat
or permanent drought. If you're under thirty, you're all but guaranteed
to witness it.]{.underline}**

If you care about the planet, and about the people and animals who live
on it, **[there are two ways to think about this. You can keep on hoping
that catastrophe is preventable, and feel ever more frustrated or
enraged by the world's inaction. Or you can accept that disaster is
coming, and begin to rethink what it means to have hope.]{.underline}**

Even at this late date, expressions of unrealistic hope continue to
abound. **[Hardly a day seems to pass without my reading that it's time
to "roll up our sleeves" and "save the planet"; that the problem of
climate change can be "solved" if we summon the collective will.
Although this message was probably still true in 1988, when the science
became fully clear, we've emitted as much atmospheric carbon in the past
thirty years as we did in the previous two centuries of
industrialization]{.underline}**. The facts have changed, but somehow
the message stays the same.

Psychologically, this denial makes sense. Despite the outrageous fact
that I'll soon be dead forever, I live in the present, not the future.
Given a choice between an alarming abstraction (death) and the
reassuring evidence of my senses (breakfast!), my mind prefers to focus
on the latter. The planet, too, is still marvelously intact, still
basically normal---seasons changing, another election year coming, new
comedies on Netflix---and its impending collapse is even harder to wrap
my mind around than death. Other kinds of apocalypse, whether religious
or thermonuclear or asteroidal, at least have the binary neatness of
dying: one moment the world is there, the next moment it's gone forever.
Climate apocalypse, by contrast, is messy. It will take the form of
increasingly severe crises compounding chaotically until civilization
begins to fray. Things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and
maybe not for everyone. Maybe not for me.

Some of the denial, however, is more willful. The evil of the Republican
Party's position on climate science is well known, but **[denial is
entrenched in progressive politics, too, or at least in its rhetoric.
The Green New Deal, the blueprint for some of the most substantial
proposals put forth on the issue, is still framed as our last chance to
avert catastrophe and save the planet, by way of gargantuan
renewable-energy projects. Many of the groups that support those
proposals deploy the language of "stopping" climate change, or imply
that there's still time to prevent it]{.underline}**. Unlike the
political right, the left prides itself on listening to climate
scientists, who do indeed allow that catastrophe is theoretically
avertable. But **[not everyone seems to be listening carefully. The
stress falls on the word *theoretically*.]{.underline}**

**[Our atmosphere and oceans can absorb only so much heat before climate
change, intensified by various feedback loops, spins completely out of
control. Some scientists and policymakers fear that we're in danger of
passing this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by
more than two degrees Celsius (maybe more, but also maybe less). The
I.P.C.C.---the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change---tells us
that, to limit the rise to less than two degrees, we not only need to
reverse the trend of the past three decades. We need to approach zero
net emissions, globally, in the *next* three decades.]{.underline}**

This is, to say the least, a tall order. It also assumes that you trust
the I.P.C.C.'s calculations. **[New research, described last month
in *Scientific American*, demonstrates that climate scientists, far from
exaggerating the threat of climate change, have underestimated its pace
and severity]{.underline}**. To project the rise in the global mean
temperature, scientists rely on complicated atmospheric modelling. They
take a host of variables and run them through supercomputers to
generate, say, ten thousand different simulations for the coming
century, in order to make a "best" prediction of the rise in
temperature. **[When a scientist predicts a rise of two degrees Celsius,
she's merely naming a number about which she's very confident: the rise
will be *at least* two degrees. The rise might, in fact, be far
higher.]{.underline}**

As a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling. I run various future
scenarios through my brain, apply the constraints of human psychology
and political reality, take note of the relentless rise in global energy
consumption (thus far, the carbon savings provided by renewable energy
have been more than offset by consumer demand), and count the scenarios
in which collective action averts catastrophe. **[The scenarios, which I
draw from the prescriptions of policymakers and activists, share certain
necessary conditions.]{.underline}**

**[The first condition is that every one of the world's major polluting
countries institute draconian conservation measures, shut down much of
its energy and transportation infrastructure, and completely retool its
economy. According to a recent paper in *Nature*, the carbon emissions
from existing global infrastructure, if operated through its normal
lifetime, will exceed our entire emissions "allowance"---the further
gigatons of carbon that can be released without crossing the threshold
of catastrophe]{.underline}**. (This estimate does not include the
thousands of new energy and transportation projects already planned or
under construction.) To stay within that allowance, a top-down
intervention needs to happen not only *in* every country
but *throughout* every country. Making New York City a green utopia will
not avail if Texans keep pumping oil and driving pickup trucks.

**[The actions taken by these countries must also be the right ones.
Vast sums of government money must be spent without wasting it and
without lining the wrong pockets]{.underline}**. Here it's useful to
recall the Kafkaesque joke of the European Union's biofuel mandate,
which served to accelerate the deforestation of Indonesia for palm-oil
plantations, and the American subsidy of ethanol fuel, which turned out
to benefit no one but corn farmers.

**[Finally, overwhelming numbers of human beings, including millions of
government-hating Americans, need to accept high taxes and severe
curtailment of their familiar life styles without revolting. They must
accept the reality of climate change and have faith in the extreme
measures taken to combat it. They can't dismiss news they dislike as
fake. They have to set aside nationalism and class and racial
resentments. They have to make sacrifices for distant threatened nations
and distant future generations. They have to be permanently terrified by
hotter summers and more frequent natural disasters, rather than just
getting used to them. Every day, instead of thinking about breakfast,
they have to think about death]{.underline}**.

Call me a pessimist or call me a humanist, but I don't see human nature
fundamentally changing anytime soon. **[I can run ten thousand scenarios
through my model, and in not one of them do I see the two-degree target
being met.]{.underline}**

To judge from recent opinion polls, which show that a majority of
Americans (many of them Republican) are pessimistic about the planet's
future, and from the success of a book like David Wallace-Wells's
harrowing "The Uninhabitable Earth," which was released this year,
**[I'm not alone in having reached this conclusion. But there continues
to be a reluctance to broadcast it. Some climate activists argue that if
we publicly admit that the problem can't be solved, it will discourage
people from taking any ameliorative action at all. This seems to me not
only a patronizing calculation but an ineffectual one, given how little
progress we have to show for it to date.]{.underline}** The activists
who make it remind me of the religious leaders who fear that, without
the promise of eternal salvation, people won't bother to behave well. In
my experience, nonbelievers are no less loving of their neighbors than
believers. And so I wonder what might happen if, instead of denying
reality, we told ourselves the truth.

First of all, even if we can no longer hope to be saved from two degrees
of warming, there's still a strong practical and ethical case for
reducing carbon emissions. In the long run, it probably makes no
difference how badly we overshoot two degrees; once the point of no
return is passed, the world will become self-transforming. In the
shorter term, however, half measures are better than no measures.
Halfway cutting our emissions would make the immediate effects of
warming somewhat less severe, and it would somewhat postpone the point
of no return. The most terrifying thing about climate change is the
speed at which it's advancing, the almost monthly shattering of
temperature records. If collective action resulted in just one fewer
devastating hurricane, just a few extra years of relative stability, it
would be a goal worth pursuing.

In fact, it would be worth pursuing even if it had no effect at all. To
fail to conserve a finite resource when conservation measures are
available, to needlessly add carbon to the atmosphere when we know very
well what carbon is doing to it, is simply wrong. Although the actions
of one individual have zero effect on the climate, this doesn't mean
that they're meaningless. Each of us has an ethical choice to make.
During the Protestant Reformation, when "end times" was merely an idea,
not the horribly concrete thing it is today, a key doctrinal question
was whether you should perform good works because it will get you into
Heaven, or whether you should perform them simply because they're
good---because, while Heaven is a question mark, you know that this
world would be better if everyone performed them. I can respect the
planet, and care about the people with whom I share it, without
believing that it will save me.

More than that, a false hope of salvation can be actively harmful. If
you persist in believing that catastrophe can be averted, you commit
yourself to tackling a problem so immense that it needs to be everyone's
overriding priority forever. One result, weirdly, is a kind of
complacency: by voting for green candidates, riding a bicycle to work,
avoiding air travel, you might feel that you've done everything you can
for the only thing worth doing. Whereas, if you accept the reality that
the planet will soon overheat to the point of threatening civilization,
there's a whole lot more you should be doing.

**[Our resources aren't infinite. Even if we invest much of them in a
longest-shot gamble, reducing carbon emissions in the hope that it will
save us, it's unwise to invest all of them. Every billion dollars spent
on high-speed trains, which may or may not be suitable for North
America, is a billion not banked for disaster preparedness, reparations
to inundated countries, or future humanitarian relief. Every
renewable-energy mega-project that destroys a living
ecosystem]{.underline}**---the "green" energy development now occurring
in Kenya's national parks, the giant hydroelectric projects in Brazil,
the construction of solar farms in open spaces, rather than in settled
areas---**[erodes the resilience of a natural world already fighting for
its life. Soil and water depletion, overuse of pesticides, the
devastation of world fisheries---collective will is needed for these
problems, too, and, unlike the problem of carbon, they're within our
power to solve. As a bonus, many low-tech conservation actions
(restoring forests, preserving grasslands, eating less meat) can reduce
our carbon footprint as effectively as massive industrial
changes.]{.underline}**

**[All-out war on climate change made sense only as long as it was
winnable. Once you accept that we've lost it, other kinds of action take
on greater meaning. Preparing for fires and floods and refugees is a
directly pertinent example. But the impending catastrophe heightens the
urgency of almost any world-improving action. In times of increasing
chaos, people seek protection in tribalism and armed force, rather than
in the rule of law, and our best defense against this kind of dystopia
is to maintain functioning democracies, functioning legal systems,
functioning communities. In this respect, any movement toward a more
just and civil society can now be considered a meaningful climate
action. Securing fair elections is a climate action. Combatting extreme
wealth inequality is a climate action. Shutting down the hate machines
on social media is a climate action. Instituting humane immigration
policy, advocating for racial and gender equality, promoting respect for
laws and their enforcement, supporting a free and independent press,
ridding the country of assault weapons---these are all meaningful
climate actions. To survive rising temperatures, every system, whether
of the natural world or of the human world, will need to be as strong
and healthy as we can make it.]{.underline}**

And then there's the matter of hope. **[If your hope for the future
depends on a wildly optimistic scenario, what will you do ten years from
now, when the scenario becomes unworkable even in theory? Give up on the
planet entirely? To borrow from the advice of financial planners, I
might suggest a more balanced portfolio of hopes, some of them
longer-term, most of them shorter. It's fine to struggle against the
constraints of human nature, hoping to mitigate the worst of what's to
come, but it's just as important to fight smaller, more local battles
that you have some realistic hope of winning. Keep doing the right thing
for the planet, yes, but also keep trying to save what you love
specifically]{.underline}**---a community, an institution, a wild place,
a species that's in trouble---and take heart in your small successes.
**[Any good thing you do now is arguably a hedge against the hotter
future, but the really meaningful thing is that it's good
today]{.underline}**. As long as you have something to love, you have
something to hope for.

In Santa Cruz, where I live, there's an organization called the Homeless
Garden Project. On a small working farm at the west end of town, it
offers employment, training, support, and a sense of community to
members of the city's homeless population. It can't "solve" the problem
of homelessness, but it's been changing lives, one at a time, for nearly
thirty years. Supporting itself in part by selling organic produce, it
contributes more broadly to a revolution in how we think about people in
need, the land we depend on, and the natural world around us. In the
summer, as a member of its C.S.A. program, I enjoy its kale and
strawberries, and in the fall, because the soil is alive and
uncontaminated, small migratory birds find sustenance in its furrows.

There may come a time, sooner than any of us likes to think, when the
systems of industrial agriculture and global trade break down and
homeless people outnumber people with homes. At that point, traditional
local farming and strong communities will no longer just be liberal
buzzwords. Kindness to neighbors and respect for the land---nurturing
healthy soil, wisely managing water, caring for pollinators---will be
essential in a crisis and in whatever society survives it. A project
like the Homeless Garden offers me the hope that the future, while
undoubtedly worse than the present, might also, in some ways, be better.
Most of all, though, it gives me hope for today.

#### Actual climate sensitivity from satellite measurements predict C02 increases will lead to 1 to 2 degrees Celsius warming

**Manheimer, 2022** (Wallace Manheimer, Retired from The US Naval
Research Lab, 2022, Journal of Sustainable Development, While the
Climate Always Has and Always Will Change, There Is no Climate Crisis,
vol. 15, No. 5, p. <https://doi.org/10.5539/jsd.v15n5p116>)

However truly the amazing thing is that the forcing as calculated by the
IPCC scientists (the believers) and as calculated by W&H (the skeptics)
are not that different. The scientists basically agree! In fact, had
they calculated the forcing over the same time periods (i.e. same
initial and final atmospheric CO2 concentrations), who knows how close
their calculations would have been, perhaps they would have gotten very
nearly the same result. It is strictly a matter of different predictions
from similar results. **[The IPCC]{.underline}** bureaucrats **[predict
that a forcing of 0.3% will cause a calamity]{.underline}**. **[The
skeptics predict that a forcing of 0.3% will cause something more like a
0.3% temperature rise]{.underline}** on the Kelvin scale**[, namely
1]{.underline}** **[to 2 degrees C.]{.underline}** To this author,
**[the latter prediction seems much more reasonable]{.underline}**. In
fact **[given the space based temperature measurements of the lower
atmosphere over the past]{.underline}** \~ **[45 years, one can very,
very roughly test the effect of the CO2 forcing.]{.underline}**
**[Figure 10 is a measurement of this temperature]{.underline}**
(Spencer 2022) **[from 1979]{.underline}** (CO2 concentration of \~ 335
ppm) **[to 2022]{.underline}** (\~415ppm), or **[an increase
of]{.underline}** **[80ppm]{.underline}**. Clearly **[in this period the
temperature,]{.underline}** averaged over many fluctuations, **[has
increased by]{.underline}** \~ **[0.6 degrees C]{.underline}**, or
\~0.2% of the temperature on the Kelvin scale. The IPCC estimated a
forcing of 1.75W/m2 with a 140 ppm increase, or \~ 1 W/m2 with an 80 ppm
increase, or about a 0.1% increase. W&H estimated their 0.3% increase in
forcing would increase the temperature by \~ 0.3-0.6%, not far off
Lamb's estimate. This all seems to hang together. Of course Figure 10
cannot be taken as confirmation of W&H's estimate of 1-2 degrees. The
atmosphere is much too complicated to be described by simply the CO2
content. For instance Figure 11 shows a NOAA (NOAA) graph of the
temperature from 1880 to the present, based on many ground based
measurement stations. Much of the time of these measurements was before
the era of space based measurement, which this author believes is the
most accurate. However in this era before space based measurement and
before significant CO2 accumulated in the atmosphere, there was still a
great deal of variation in temperature. Notice that from 1920 to 1950,
when CO2 levels were quite low, there was nearly a 1oC increase in
temperature, an increase greater than from 1979 according to Figure 10,
where the temperature rise might have been due to CO2. Also notice that
from 1979 to the present, the ground based and space based measurements
certainly do not follow one another exactly. There is a significant
uncertainty even a comparison of one type of measurement to another. All
of this, **[these theories, and the measurements certainly do not
support the assertion of a rapidly approaching climate
crisis.]{.underline}**

#### No risk of catastrophic warming due to expansion of renewables and decline of coal

**Lawton, 2023** (Graham Lawton, staff writer at New Scientist, 1-11-23,
New Scientist, The worst-case climate scenarios are no longer plausible
today, p.
<https://institutions.newscientist.com/article/mg25734211-000-the-worst-case-climate-scenarios-are-no-longer-plausible-today/>)

This is obviously alarming news, but, in truth, things aren't as bad as
they appear. Don't worry, I haven't fallen down a climate denial rabbit
hole. We are still in trouble and need to act quickly. But the fact of
the matter is that we are making decent progress. **[Ten years ago there
was a genuine fear that we were heading for catastrophic warming of
between 4°C and 5°C by 2100. Today, those worst-case scenarios are no
longer plausible.]{.underline}** The story goes back to
**[2014,]{.underline}** when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change **[(IPCC]{.underline}**) **[published]{.underline}** 1184 future
greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. To make this baggy monster
tractable, the scientists boiled them down to four: one very high
scenario, one very low and two in between. The very high one assumed
that there would be no climate action whatsoever and that use of fossil
fuels would continue on an upward trajectory until 2100. It became known
as **[the business as usual scenario, or BAU.]{.underline}** BAU quickly
garnered more scientific and media attention than the other scenarios,
in part because it extrapolated the situation at the time, but also
because **[it]{.underline}** **[made for sensational scientific papers
and apocalyptic newspaper headlines.]{.underline}** A BAU world would
have been a "truly catastrophic hellscape of a planet", says climate
scientist Zeke Hausfather of NGO Berkeley Earth in California. In the
years since, however, the world has changed dramatically. **[Progress on
renewable energy technology and implementation of climate policies have
bent the emissions curve downwards towards warming of around 3°C by the
end of the century.]{.underline}** Still dangerous, but not hellish. And
**[further progress isn't just possible, but promised]{.underline}**.
Recent analyses show that, **[if countries achieve the net-zero pledges
that they have already put on the table, warming will stay under
2°C.]{.underline}** As a result, **[the BAU scenario is no longer even
remotely plausible, says Roger Pielke, an environmental scientist at the
University of Colorado, Boulder. Nor is the next-worse of the four. "It
looks like the apocalyptic scenarios, as of today, are off the table,"
he says.]{.underline}** If anything, **[says Hausfather]{.underline}**,
**[BAU was implausible]{.underline}** in the first place. It wasn't just
a conservative extrapolation of current trends, but **[a turbocharged
one that assumed]{.underline}**, for example, that **[the use of coal
would increase fivefold by 2100, with no climate mitigation action
whatsoever.]{.underline}**
