[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, once a frozen frontier largely
ignored by global powers, [has [emerged as]{.mark} a geopolitical
**[hotspot]{.mark}** in the 21st century.]{.underline} Climate change
has melted vast swathes of polar ice, unveiling [**[new]{.mark}**
**[shipping]{.mark}** routes]{.underline}, untapped [natural
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [**[strategic
opportunities]{.mark}**. At [the **heart**]{.mark}]{.underline} of this
transformation lies a seemingly mundane yet increasingly critical tool:
[[**the icebreaker**.]{.mark} These specialized vessels]{.underline},
capable of smashing through thick ice to clear paths for navigation,
[have become [symbols of **national power**]{.mark}, sovereignty, and
ambition]{.underline} in the Arctic. [[Nations]{.mark} like Russia,
China, Canada, Finland, and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[are **racing**]{.mark} to bolster their icebreaker
fleets]{.underline}, driven by a mix of economic interests, security
concerns, and territorial claims. This article explores how
[[icebreakers]{.mark} have evolved from utilitarian ships into
[**pivotal** instruments of geopolitics]{.mark}, with a focus on Arctic
sovereignty and exploration]{.underline}, and provides background on the
fleets and future plans of these key players.

The Arctic's New Geopolitical Frontier

[The [Arctic]{.mark} Circle]{.underline}, encompassing the Arctic Ocean
and the northern reaches of eight countries, [[holds]{.mark} immense
potential.]{.underline} The U.S. Geological [Survey estimates it
contains 90 billion barrels of **[oil]{.mark}**, 1,669 trillion cubic
feet of natural **[gas]{.mark},** and vast]{.underline} deposits of
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**are **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**arth
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ineral**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**---resources
[[worth **trillions**]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars. Meanwhile,
melting ice has opened up the Northern Sea Route [(NSR)]{.underline}
along Russia's coast and the Northwest Passage through Canada's
archipelago, [promising **[shorter shipping]{.mark}** lanes between
Asia, Europe, and North America. These developments have [turned]{.mark}
the [Arctic into]{.mark} a [stage for **great power
competition**]{.mark}, where presence and capability are
paramount.]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers are the **backbone**]{.mark} of this contest. [They enable
year-round access]{.mark} to icy waters]{.underline}, support
**[[scientific research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, facilitate **[[resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and project **[[military
power.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For Arctic nations, [they are tools of
sovereignty, ensuring [control over]{.mark} territorial waters
and]{.underline} exclusive economic zones
**[[(EEZs).]{.mark}]{.underline}** For non-Arctic states like China,
they represent a foothold in a region far from their shores. As the ice
recedes, [the ability to operate in the
Arctic]{.underline}---particularly during the harsh winter months---[has
made icebreakers a barometer of national strength and
intent.]{.underline}

Russia: The Icebreaker Titan

[[Russia **dominates**]{.mark} the Arctic icebreaker
landscape]{.underline}, boasting the world's largest and most capable
fleet. With over 40 operational icebreakers, including seven
nuclear-powered giants, Moscow has leveraged its Soviet-era legacy to
maintain a commanding presence in the region. [[The
**N**]{.underline}]{.mark}orthern **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oute, stretching along Russia's
24,000-kilometer Arctic coastline, [is a cornerstone of its
strategy.]{.underline} Russia views the NSR as both [a commercial
artery---potentially slashing shipping times between Europe and Asia by
40%---and a national security priority.]{.underline}

The jewel of Russia's fleet is the Arktika-class nuclear icebreakers
under Project 22220. The lead ship, Arktika, began sea trials in 2019,
followed by Sibir and Ural, with Yakutia and Chukotka under
construction. These behemoths, capable of breaking ice up to 3 meters
thick, dwarf most competitors in size and power. Russia aims to have 13
heavy-duty icebreakers by 2035, reinforcing its dominance. Additionally,
[[it has]{.mark} introduced **[combat icebreakers]{.mark}** like the
Ivan Papanin, armed with missiles, signaling [a **militarized**
approach]{.mark} to Arctic control.]{.underline} Backed by 17 deep-water
ports and a network of renovated Cold War-era bases, Russia's icebreaker
fleet underpins its claim as the Arctic's preeminent power.

China: The "Near-Arctic" Challenger

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite lacking Arctic territory,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} boldly declared itself a "near-Arctic state"
since its 2018 Arctic Policy white paper. Its interest stems from [[the
**Polar Silk Road**, an extension of]{.mark} the
**[B]{.mark}**]{.underline}elt and **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oad
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nitiative, which envisions Arctic shipping
routes as a shortcut for its trade with Europe. Beijing also eyes the
region's resources [[to **fuel** its]{.mark} industrial
[economy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Though its icebreaker fleet is modest
compared to Russia's, China is rapidly expanding its capabilities.

China operates three icebreakers: Xue Long (Snow Dragon), a converted
Ukrainian cargo ship acquired in 1994; Xue Long 2, a domestically built
vessel launched in 2019 with Finnish design input; and Jidi, a
next-generation icebreaker unveiled in 2024. A fourth, a heavy polar
icebreaker with a 26,000-ton displacement, is in development, with plans
for nuclear propulsion---a technology only Russia currently masters. In
summer 2024, China made headlines by deploying all three icebreakers to
the Arctic simultaneously, operating near Alaska alongside Russian
vessels, a move that alarmed U.S. officials. [This [growing
presence,]{.mark} coupled with seabed mapping and intelligence-gathering
activities, [underscores]{.mark} China's [ambition to become a **polar
player**]{.mark}]{.underline}, challenging Arctic nations' dominance.

Canada: Defending the Northwest Passage

Canada's Arctic sovereignty hinges on the Northwest Passage, a
historically ice-choked route through its northern archipelago. Ottawa
claims these waters as internal, subject to its full control, a stance
contested by the United States, which views them as an international
strait. Icebreakers are critical for Canada to assert its authority,
support Indigenous communities, and protect its EEZ, which holds
significant oil and gas reserves.

The Canadian Coast Guard operates nine icebreakers, including two heavy
vessels (\*CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent\* and CCGS Terry Fox) and seven
medium ones. However, many are aging, with Louis S. St-Laurent,
commissioned in 1969, nearing retirement. Canada's National Shipbuilding
Strategy includes plans for new icebreakers, such as the John G.
Diefenbaker, a polar-class vessel slated for delivery in the early
2030s, though delays and cost overruns have plagued the program. The
2024 ICE Pact with the U.S. and Finland aims to accelerate construction,
leveraging Canadian shipyards like Davie, which acquired Finland's
Helsinki Shipyard in 2023. Canada's fleet renewal is both a practical
necessity and a geopolitical statement, reinforcing its Arctic claims
against Russian and Chinese encroachment.

Finland: The Icebreaker Superpower

Finland, though not a major Arctic power in territorial terms, is a
global leader in icebreaker design and construction. With 80% of the
world's icebreakers designed and 60% built by Finnish firms, its
expertise is unrivaled. This stems from necessity: Finland's Baltic Sea
ports freeze annually, requiring icebreakers to keep trade flowing,
which accounts for over 90% of its commerce. The state-owned Arctia Ltd.
manages a fleet of eight to twelve icebreakers (estimates vary due to
classification differences), including the innovative Polaris, launched
in 2017, which uses LNG for cleaner operation.

Finland's role in the ICE Pact, signed in July 2024 with the U.S. and
Canada, positions it as a linchpin in Western Arctic strategy. Finnish
shipyards can deliver polar-class vessels in 24 months at a fraction of
U.S. costs, offering a cost-effective solution to allies. The pact aims
to produce 70--90 icebreakers over the next decade, boosting Finland's
economy while countering Russia's fleet advantage. Finland's NATO
membership, formalized in 2023, further aligns its icebreaking prowess
with Western security goals, making it a quiet but critical player in
Arctic geopolitics.

The United States: Playing Catch-Up

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, an
Arctic nation via Alaska, [**[lags]{.mark}** far behind its rivals. The
U.S. Coast Guard [operates]{.mark} just [two]{.mark} aging icebreakers:
Polar Star]{.underline}, commissioned in 1976 and overdue for
retirement, and Healy, a medium icebreaker sidelined in 2024 by an
electrical fire. A third, Polar Sea, is inactive and being cannibalized
for parts. This paltry fleet contrasts starkly with Russia's dozens and
China's growing numbers, [[leaving the U.S. reliant
on]{.underline}]{.mark} allies like **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for Arctic access---a vulnerability in an era of heightened competition.

The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program aims to build six to nine new
icebreakers, with the first, Polar Sentinel, now delayed to 2030 due to
cost overruns (estimated at \$10 billion total) and design challenges.
In December 2024, the Coast Guard acquired Aiviq, a former oil
exploration vessel, as an interim solution, to be based in Juneau,
Alaska. The ICE Pact represents a strategic pivot, tapping Finnish and
Canadian expertise to scale up production. U.S. leaders, from President
Trump in 2020 to Admiral Linda Fagan in 2024, have emphasized
icebreakers as vital for sovereignty, security, and countering Russian
and Chinese advances. Yet, with only one heavy icebreaker operational
today, the U.S. faces a steep climb to reclaim Arctic relevance.

The Future of Icebreaker Geopolitics

Icebreakers have transcended their traditional roles, becoming chess
pieces in a high-stakes Arctic game. Russia's fleet ensures its
dominance along the NSR, while China's expansion signals broader polar
ambitions. Canada and the U.S., spurred by the ICE Pact, are racing to
close the gap, with Finland providing the industrial backbone. Projected
construction---Russia's 13 heavy icebreakers by 2035, China's nuclear
aspirations, and the West's 70--90 new vessels---foreshadows an
intensifying contest.

Beyond numbers, [the **[militarization]{.mark}** of
icebreakers]{.underline}, as seen in Russia's combat variants,
[[raises]{.mark} the **[specter of conflict]{.mark}** over shipping
lanes and resources. **[Sovereignty disputes]{.mark}**]{.underline},
like Canada's over the Northwest Passage, [[could
**escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark} as ice recedes and traffic grows.
Meanwhile, [exploration]{.underline}---scientific and economic---[relies
on [icebreakers]{.mark} to **[unlock]{.mark}** the Arctic's secrets and
**[wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, making them indispensable to national
strategies. In this frozen frontier, [icebreakers are not just breaking
ice; they're **[breaking]{.mark}** new [**ground** in **global
power**]{.mark} dynamics.]{.underline}

#### Development is [inevitable]{.underline} and the [lynchpin]{.underline} of arctic dominance, but the US needs to expand the [speed]{.underline} and [scope]{.underline} of development.

Them,"
https://www.wsj.com/world/trumps-arctic-goals-demand-icebreakers-but-u-s-struggles-to-build-them-e13a33b9\]

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to crash through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
U.S.'s only icebreaker that operates year-round, and it was built nearly
half a century ago.

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic,
[[icebreakers]{.mark} are the **[essential]{.mark}** tool [to]{.mark}
open **[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} routes, [allow [**resource
extraction** and]{.mark} project [**military power**.]{.mark} The
[U.S.]{.mark} and its allies have **[fallen]{.mark}** far
**[behind]{.mark}** Russia, and China is rapidly gaining
ground]{.underline} with the help of the world's largest shipbuilding
industry.

President [[Trump]{.mark} has **[signaled]{.mark}** that he wants [to
put]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} back [at]{.mark} the [**top** of]{.mark}
the U.S.'s priority [list]{.mark}.]{.underline} [He has
said]{.underline} the U.S. needs to take ownership of Greenland for
national security and that the [[Coast Guard will expand]{.mark} its
[fleet]{.mark} of icebreakers.]{.underline}

[["We're going to order]{.mark} about **[40]{.mark}** Coast Guard big
icebreakers. Big ones,"]{.underline} Trump said last month.

[That will be **[a tall order]{.mark}** to fill. The [U.S. has been
**struggling**]{.mark}]{.underline} for years to build a single
icebreaker---vessels that clear a path through the ice for other ships.
Even if Trump is able to marshal the political will and money to build
more, [the [U.S. will have to **breathe life back** into]{.mark} its
ailing [shipbuilding]{.mark} industr]{.underline}y, which has been in
decline for decades.

[Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile, [has]{.underline} around [40
icebreakers capable of operating in polar conditions, as well as new
giant nuclear-powered ones]{.underline} under construction. Despite
being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle, [China has four such
vessels.]{.underline} Its first domestically built nuclear-powered
icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year, experts say.

[[Russia]{.mark} has [faced setbacks]{.mark} in recent
years.]{.underline} Sanctions over the Ukraine war have limited its
access to components and technologies needed to build icebreakers, such
as propulsion systems and radar equipment. A nuclear-powered icebreaker
under construction called Rossiya is running three years behind
schedule. [[But]{.mark} it already [has a **massive lead**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} years of [experience operating in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

As in other areas, Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions. It took a Chinese shipyard two years to deliver
one recent icebreaker. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will be a
heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction started
only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to build it.

Cutting through thick Arctic ice

[[Icebreakers are]{.mark} seen as **[indispensable]{.mark}** for
maintaining a presence in the Arctic.]{.underline} Even as global
temperatures warm and open up shipping lanes, [the region remains
largely impenetrable for ships in all but one or two summer
month]{.underline}s---unless accompanied by a Polar class icebreaker.

Greenland, the world's largest island, is still treacherous to
circumnavigate by ship because of the ice conditions. The island has one
of the world's largest undeveloped zinc deposits in its far north, but
the fjord where it is located is icebound almost all of the year.

["We can't access the region and we can't have a presence without
icebreakers,"]{.underline} said Shannon Jenkins, a senior Arctic policy
adviser at the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates U.S. icebreakers.

Icebreakers are classified based on the thickness of the ice they can
handle, with [Polar-class ships built for the thickest ice. [Russia has
**seven** of the heaviest]{.mark} class of Polar icebreakers. The [U.S.
and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [have]{.mark} a combined
**[three]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with an average age of 46 years,
according to consulting firm Arctic Marine Solutions.

Polar icebreakers are shaped in a way that allows them to push their
bows up onto the ice and break it with the ship's weight. The broken ice
generally folds under adjacent solid ice, leaving a path of clear water
in the ship's wake.

Icebreakers have reinforced hulls that add weight to the ships, and
powerful engines. While conventional ships usually give priority to fuel
efficiency over raw power, that math doesn't work for icebreakers, which
need to generate greater force to break through the ice.

The U.S.'s Polar Star, which was commissioned in 1976, is nearly 20
years beyond its designed service life, according to a Congressional
Budget Office report last year. The U.S.'s second icebreaker, the Healy,
commissioned in 1999, is less powerful, with half the horsepower of the
heavy icebreaker.

Canada, which has around 100,000 miles of Arctic coastline, has two
Polar-class vessels and two under construction. Over the past decade,
they have also built five Arctic and offshore patrol ships---armed
vessels that can plow through ice.

European nations including Finland, Sweden, the U.K. and Germany---all
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization---have a further 13
icebreakers capable of working in the Arctic, according to some of those
countries and the Arctic Institute, a think tank.

The U.S. battle to build an icebreaker

Polar icebreakers are expensive and complex, and the U.S. hasn't built
one since the Polar Star. The U.S. awarded a contract to build a new
heavy icebreaker, the Polar Sentinel, in 2019. The first of three new
planned ice breakers, it isn't expected to be finished until after 2030.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost for the three
ships will reach \$5.1 billion, 60% higher than original projections.

The U.S. icebreaker program has fallen so far behind Russia partly
because the Arctic faded as a U.S. priority after the Cold War. That
began to change around a decade ago, said Rebecca Pincus, director of
the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank.

[But [momentum]{.mark} on building icebreakers [has been hampered
by]{.mark} the Coast Guard's small [**budgets** and]{.mark} lack of
**[political power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, said Pincus, who has worked
on Arctic policy at the Coast Guard and the Defense Department. The
Coast Guard has moved from department to department before most recently
becoming a part of Homeland Security.

#### Icebreaker dominance lets Russia [circumvent]{.underline} the oil price cap and limit US maneuverability.

"Confronting America's Polar Icebreaker Gap,"
https://www.thefai.org/posts/confronting-america-s-polar-icebreaker-gap\]

The [[Arctic is]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer just a frozen
expanse---it is quickly becoming [[a]{.mark} geopolitical
**[hotspot]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As its ice diminishes, its [[economic
potentia]{.mark}l has increased. Arctic [shipping]{.mark}
routes]{.underline} between the Atlantic and Pacific [offer the
potential to [reduce travel]{.mark} times by up to 40%,]{.underline} and
the area is estimated to [[contain]{.mark} 13% of the world's
undiscovered [oil and]{.mark} 30% of its untapped natural [gas]{.mark}
reserves]{.underline}. However, far less attention has been given to
what is required for successful U.S. deterrence in the Arctic,
particularly in countering Russia's assertiveness.

The Arctic is particularly valuable for America's competitors. [[Russia
has used the]{.underline}]{.mark} Northern Sea Route [[(NSR) to
bypass]{.mark} the West\'s \$60-per-barrel [oil price
cap]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2023, [a record 80% of Russian oil exports
were shipped via non-G7 tankers, avoiding the cap]{.underline}, with
exports to China rising by 23% since the invasion of Ukraine. [Oil
[shipments]{.mark} along the NSR have also
**[surged]{.mark}**]{.underline}, growing from zero before the war to
over ten in 2023. Given the Arctic\'s strategic economic and military
importance, [the [U.S. must]{.mark} **[bolster]{.mark}** its
**[infrastructure]{.mark}** and military capabilities for successful
deterrence]{.underline}, which it currently lacks.

During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier
this year, General Gregory M. Guillot, the Commander of the U.S.
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), warned that ["[we're]{.mark} severely
[**outnumbered**" and]{.mark} have [**limited** "freedom of
maneuver"]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic. The numbers concerning
**[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [are [**crucial**
for]{.mark} enabling [naval forces to **navigate**]{.mark} ice-covered
waters, are particularly stark.]{.underline} Compared to Russia's seven
nuclear-powered and thirty diesel-powered icebreakers, [the U.S.
operates only two diesel-powered icebreakers.]{.underline} Since the
Polar Sea, one of the U.S.'s two heavy polar icebreakers, suffered an
engine casualty in 2010, the Coast Guard has relied on the Polar Star as
its sole operational heavy icebreaker.

Meanwhile, [[Russia]{.mark} continues to **[expand]{.mark}** its
icebreaker [fleet]{.mark} to **[reinforce]{.mark}** its regional
**[dominance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Through its Project 22220
initiative, [[Russia]{.mark} is [developing]{.mark} at least six
**[nuclear]{.mark}**-powered [icebreakers]{.mark}:]{.underline} three
already built, a fourth under construction, and two more in development.
Decades of sustained investment have given Russia a commanding presence
in the Arctic---one that the U.S. is currently unprepared to counter.

[[**Delays** and]{.mark} rising **[costs]{.mark}** have [beset efforts
to modernize]{.mark} its Arctic icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} The Polar
Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver its first icebreaker ready
until 2029. Unresolved design issues and rising material and labor costs
have increased the price of the first three ships by 39 percent. As a
result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15 million per year to repair the
aging Polar Star, which first entered service in 1976. The U.S. Coast
Guard assessed that [[America needs]{.mark} at least [eight]{.mark}
icebreakers]{.underline} -- four heavy and four medium ships --
[[for]{.mark} its future polar [missions. Without]{.mark} a [**shift**
in Arctic policy]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. and its allies may
[**struggle** to counter Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s [increasing
influence.]{.underline}

#### Enforcing the price cap is key to limit Russian oil revenues that sustain expansion into Ukraine. 

**Brooks '24** \[Robin and Ben Harris; June 26; senior fellow in the
Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, PhD
in Economics at Yale; vice president and director of Economic Studies at
the Brookings Institution, PhD in Economics at George Washington
University; Brookings, "Why the US should sanction more Russian
tankers,"
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-the-us-should-sanction-more-russian-tankers/\]

The [**[price cap]{.mark}** was established]{.underline} with the [dual
goals of [limit]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[Russian profits]{.mark} from
the trade of crude oil]{.underline} and refined products [[while]{.mark}
also [maintaining **stability**]{.mark} in global energy
markets.]{.underline} The central approach established by the price cap
coalition (the G7, plus the European Union and Australia) was to
disallow the provision of services in trades that exceeded the maximum
allowable price of each product. The primary lever utilized by the
coalition was the sanctioning of service providers who violated these
terms, with a broad range of services subject to the cap, including
shipping, insurance, brokering, flagging, and financing.

The [**[success]{.mark}** of the price cap [was]{.mark}]{.underline}
most pronounced in the early stages of its implementation, especially in
terms of [**[limiting]{.mark}** trading **[profits]{.mark}** accruing to
Russia.]{.underline} In terms of export volumes, Russia's seaborne
exports of crude oil and refined product have been stable near six
million barrels per day since December 2022, so a key goal of the price
cap---to ensure the continued flow of Russian oil to global
markets---has been met. Simultaneously, the composition of its exports
has shifted away from advanced economies---which now import near
zero---to emerging markets, where China, India and Turkey have emerged
as large buyers. Despite drastic reshuffling of its export destinations,
export volumes have remained largely stable since the invasion of
Ukraine---and have even increased on the margin prior to recent
voluntary cutbacks to meet OPEC+ production quotas. Price stability has
accompanied global production stability, which is somewhat remarkable
when contrasted against geopolitical turmoil in oil production-relevant
regions.

With export volumes stable, [Russia's [oil tax revenues---**critical**
to fund]{.mark} its [war in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}---have
[[fluctuated]{.underline}]{.mark} with the price of Urals (Figure 2). In
the months before and after the pre-announced implementation of the
[[price cap]{.underline}]{.mark} in December 2022, Russian
[[revenues]{.underline}]{.mark} remained
**[[depressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to the U.S. Treasury
Department, [Russian oil tax [revenues fell]{.mark} by **[40%]{.mark}**
over the first nine months of]{.underline} 2023 compared to one year
earlier, while analysis from the Atlantic Council put the monthly
revenue loss at around \$5 billion through the first ten months of the
cap. However, as the price of Urals has risen over the past year, so
have Russia's tax revenues on oil, a key challenge for the coalition of
countries behind the price cap. Notable, too, is the closing of the
Brent-Urals spread, suggesting that Russia has devised strategies for
circumventing the price cap.

The closing of the Brent-Urals spread has been enabled by Russian
countermeasures to circumvent the price cap, namely the cultivation of
an expanded shadow fleet of aging tankers, often covered by inferior
insurance provided by the Russian company Ingosstrakh. The expanded
[[shadow fleet has allowed Russia to blunt the]{.mark} price
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline} of compliant service providers by shifting
away from Western-provided services, which simultaneously reduces the
leverage of non-Western trading partners like China. While the expanded
shadow fleet ultimately means more oil revenue for Russia, the gain is
somewhat offset by increased expenditures for obtaining the shadow fleet
and higher trading costs---namely increased insurance fees. That being
said, [the key point is that **[limiting]{.mark}** the scope of
[the]{.mark} [shadow fleet is **central** to]{.mark} preserving the
continued **[success]{.mark}** of the price cap.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine's defeat is [existential]{.underline}. 

Peter **Dickinson '23**. Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasian
Center. \"Arming Ukraine is cheap compared to the far higher price of
Russian victory\". Atlantic Council. 10-26-2023.
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/arming-ukraine-is-cheap-compared-to-the-far-higher-price-of-russian-victory/

McConnell's arguments are certainly persuasive. However, in order to
fully appreciate the true value of continued support for Ukraine, [it is
necessary to contemplate what would happen [if **Western**]{.mark}
military [**aid** came to an end]{.mark} and Vladimir **Putin**
**succeeded** in **subjugating** the country.]{.underline}

The most immediate costs of a Russian victory would be felt by the
Ukrainian population, of course. With much or all of Ukraine under
Russian control, the war crimes already witnessed in occupied areas of
the country would multiply. Tens of thousands would be executed or
imprisoned, while millions would be subjected to forced deportation.
[These horrors would create **major humanitarian challenges** for the
wider **European community**, with a **[massive new wave]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **Ukrainian [refugees]{.mark}** [flooding]{.mark} across the
**border** into [the **EU**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Vindicated]{.underline} **[and [emboldened]{.mark} by victory in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, [[Putin]{.mark} would]{.underline} almost
certainly seek to go further. The Russian dictator has already made
clear that he sees the reconquest of Ukraine as part of a broader
mission to correct the perceived injustice of the Soviet collapse and
the fall of "historical Russia." [His next [targets would]{.mark} most
likely [be]{.mark} **[Moldova]{.mark}**, **[Armenia]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} the countries of **[Central Asia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[If the West proves unwilling or unable to stop Russia in **Ukraine**,
there will be [little to **deter**]{.mark} **further aggression**
against **smaller** and more [**vulnerable** former Soviet
republics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[With **[NATO discredited]{.mark}**]{.underline} by the fall of Ukraine,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} [would then be tempted to [test]{.mark} the
**[resolve]{.mark} of the alliance** in a more fundamental manner by
[threatening the Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would a demoralized
and divided NATO go to war with a resurgent Russia over an isolated
incident on the Estonian or Latvian border? If not,
**[Putin]{.underline}** [would **exploit this weakness**]{.underline}.
[[Failure to defend]{.mark} the territorial integrity of a **NATO member
state** would [spark]{.mark} the **rapid** [**unraveling of the entire
alliance**,]{.mark} [plunging]{.mark} the whole of [**Europe** into
**chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Even if the worst case scenario of a **[[direct]{.mark} military
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[between]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[could be **avoided**,]{.underline} [a Russian victory in Ukraine would
inevitably oblige Western leaders to boost]{.underline} **[defense
spending]{.underline}** to levels not witnessed since the end of the
Cold War. This would require sums far in excess of the money currently
being allocated to Ukraine. Outgoing US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair
General Mark Milley recently warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine
would lead to a potential "doubling" of defense budgets. Others have
suggested the cost would be much higher, noting the need to establish
and indefinitely maintain a dramatically increased military presence in
Central and Eastern Europe.

While the direct financial and security costs of a Russian victory in
Ukraine are already alarming, [the **geopolitical price** would be even
**greater**]{.underline}. The recent escalation in
**[Israel]{.underline}** [is a direct consequence of the West's
**indecisive response** to]{.underline} Russia's attack on
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. If Putin's invasion is seen to succeed,
[other **[authoritarians]{.mark}** will be [encouraged]{.mark} and
**international [instability]{.mark}** [will **spread even
further**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The entire world will face **[decades
of insecurity]{.mark}** marked by mounting **militarism**, **mutual
suspicion**, and multiplying acts of **international
aggression**]{.underline}. [The opportunity [cost to the]{.mark}
**[global economy]{.mark}** will be **measured** in the **[tens of
trillions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

None of this is inevitable. On the [contrary, it can **all be avoided**
by providing Ukraine with the tools to defeat Russia]{.underline}. The
Ukrainians are ready and able to do the fighting themselves; all they
ask is for their international partners to stop dithering and deliver
the necessary weapons without delay.

Opponents of continued military [aid]{.underline} to Ukraine often say
it is too expensive. In reality, it [is **infinitely cheaper** than the
**alternative**.]{.underline} They also claim supporting Ukraine risks
provoking **[[World War III]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but in truth,
[nothing is **more [likely]{.mark}** [to **provoke**]{.mark} **Putin**
than **[Western weakness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

With his genocidal invasion of Ukraine, the [Russian dictator has burned
his last remaining bridges and is now completely **committed to
confrontation** with the **West**]{.underline}. He will not stop until
he is stopped. The longer Western leaders delay, the higher the price
they will pay.

#### Russia and Chinese collaboration and dominance over icebreakers lets them [militarize]{.underline} the arctic.

Russia And China: Dozens Of Ships, Big Ambitions

When the Pentagon presented its new arctic strategy in late July, it
highlighted in detail [[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s interest
in advancing their respective Arctic capabilities as well as the fact
they are frequently leaning on one another to achieve their goals.

"Increasingly, the \[People's Republic of China\] and Russia [[are
**collaborating**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} across multiple
instruments of national power. While significant areas of disagreement
between the PRC and Russia remain, [their growing [alignment]{.mark} in
the region [is of **concern**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and DoD continues to
monitor this cooperation," according to the document. [["Russia's
**isolation**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine [has [made it]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[[reliant on the PRC for]{.mark} financing energy [export
infrastructure]{.mark} in the Arctic."]{.underline}

The US Coast Guard's data indicates that as of 2020, Russia's fleet was
just a few ships short of the Moscow's recent claim of 41 ships, with
several vessels under construction. Another extensive icebreaker tracker
comes from Aker Arctic, a Finnish shipbuilding firm dating back to the
1930s, which tallied roughly four dozen Russian icebreakers without
considering vessels caught in the gray areas --- capable of breaking ice
but not always used for that purpose.

The ambiguity around what constitutes an "icebreaker" makes comparing
these tallies against one another difficult, but there is a clear
consensus among sources that Russia has prioritized being able to
navigate ice both in polar regions and elsewhere its fleet might be
needed.

[["Russia's icebreaking capacity is significant]{.mark},"]{.underline}
said Salonius-Pasternak. "\[You\] just have to look at the map. They've
of course had many reasons to keep it up," referring to the country's
geolocation and the environments its ships must frequently transit.

And with that in mind, the Pentagon's Arctic strategy warns not to
underestimate the country's ambitions.

"Russia's maritime infrastructure [[could allow it to enforce
**excessive** and **illegal** maritime claims along the]{.mark} Northern
Sea Route ([NSR]{.mark})]{.underline} between the Bering Strait and Kara
Strait," according to the document. "Russia claims the right to regulate
Arctic waters along the NSR in excess of the authority permitted under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), placing
excessive requirements on foreign vessels transiting the route and
threatening force against vessels out of compliance with Russian
regulations."

While Russia's geolocation and membership in the Arctic Council, an
international forum for Arctic nations to sort out disagreements, give
it explicit and inherent interest in the High North, Chinese ambitions
and icebreaker shipbuilding is a more complicated issue for Washington.

In 2017, [[China]{.mark} claimed to be a "near-arctic state" and
[has]{.mark} since then [sought to insert itself into]{.mark} the
[governance]{.mark} of both the High North]{.underline} --- a claim the
US has rejected --- as well as the Antarctic, where its claims have
greater credibility on the global stage given its geolocation.

China is known to [[operate]{.underline}]{.mark} at least five
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, not all of which are capable of
polar navigation, and like other countries, certain ships are owned by
the state while others are managed by universities. (Pentagon officials
contend the line between military and commercial use is less meaningful
in the context of the Chinese because, they say, the state will
frequently and covertly use assets for dual purposes.)

Beijing has also previously [[announced]{.underline}]{.mark} it was
developing a **[[nuclear-powered icebreaker,]{.underline}]{.mark}** but
publicly available details about that ship remain scarce. The country's
opacity makes it difficult to track its ships in detail, even for
veteran observers.

GRAPHIC OMITTED

Elizabeth Buchanan, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute, told Breaking Defense that [China's proclaimed stake in the
arctic stems from its economy and security turning on "the ability to
secure unrestrained sea lines]{.underline} of communication and control
of global trade."

"The emerging [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}orthern [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}oute, further [[bolstered by partnership with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Far East, North Pacific Ocean and
Russia's Northern Sea Route, [[connect Beijing to
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} in a much more efficient (time and cost
terms) manner," she said. ["**[Militarizing the route]{.mark}** would
further [ensure]{.mark} supply [security]{.mark} [and allow China to
diversify]{.mark} its reliance on the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea for seaborne trade between Asia
and Europe."

She also argued that the United States' speedy rejection of China's
"near-arctic state" claim was "risky" because it allows Beijing to
criticize Washington for not respecting China's rights to the high seas.

[For [the US]{.mark} to secure its own interest in the
arctic]{.underline}, she said, it [[must **invest**]{.mark} in
capabilities [to **"deter**]{.mark} ambitious [Chinese behavior" --- to
include]{.mark}]{.underline}, but not limited to,
**[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. ICE Pact could offer one pathway
to doing that.

#### Russia is revisionist. Arctic militarization is the [cornerstone]{.underline} of its strategy to crack the liberal international order.

In some ways, the Kremlin's focus has paid off. Unlike in other
geopolitical arenas where Moscow faces economic and military
constraints, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} now [enjoys significant
advantages in the Arctic]{.underline}. It [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} the
world's [**[largest]{.mark}** fleet of **[icebreaker]{.mark}**
ships]{.underline}, maintains a [[strong **military**]{.mark}
presence]{.underline} in the region and
**[[controls]{.underline}]{.mark}** more than half of [the Arctic
[coastline.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But Moscow also has significant economic and military insecurities in
the region. Efforts by Western countries in 2022 to isolate Russia from
Arctic cooperation, as well as a more ambitious US, have only fuelled
these anxieties. In response, the Kremlin has doubled down on its Arctic
strategy in both visible and opaque ways, forming what this paper will
call a "policy iceberg". Russia's massive economic investment is the
visible tip; its attempts to create a northern sea trade route buoy at
the waterline with both clear economic and murkier military aims; while
its [[attempts to **militarise**]{.underline}]{.mark} in [the
Arctic]{.underline} are submerged from view---and the most
**[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing to [[Western
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In time, [[Moscow hopes]{.mark} the Arctic can become part of its
leverage [to]{.mark} help [renegotiate a **"new world
order".**]{.mark}]{.underline} This strategy involves asserting itself
in the Arctic not only through economic investment and military displays
but also via overt cooperation with China. Meanwhile, [Moscow aims to
[use]{.mark} symbolic concessions in the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
(such as arms control deals, a revived Arctic Council or limits on
non-Arctic state involvement) [[as]{.mark} bargaining [chips for
strategic gains]{.mark}]{.underline} elsewhere, particularly [[in
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} This year's negotiations with the US
showed signs of this, with Russia using Arctic cooperation on offshore
resources as a lure to reopen broader talks with the West.

With Putin personally invested in strengthening Russian control over the
Arctic and Trump signalling a prioritisation of the region, the next
major point of European confrontation could be in the Barents or Baltic
seas---not in eastern or central Europe.

In this paper, we examine the new phase of Russia's Arctic policy,
focusing on domestic shifts and external positioning. It seeks to
distinguish the Kremlin's actual priorities from the image it projects
to pressure the West into renewed negotiations over Arctic governance
and Russia's broader geopolitical standing. To do so, we examine how two
core insecurities shape Russia's Arctic policy, analyse their
implementation and explore how they are projected internationally
through legal, diplomatic and bilateral instruments. This paper
concludes with four key recommendations for European policymakers to
mitigate Russia's economic and military ambitions and to avoid getting
squeezed out of an increasingly strategic region.

The cold hotspot

For a long time, European Arctic states were determined to see the
region as a "peaceful zone of cooperation". Before 2022, the main Arctic
issues for Europe were climate change, the environment and sustainable
development. Also on the agenda were new economic opportunities in
shipping routes, energy reserves and rare minerals. But these were not a
priority.

That era has ended. [[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is no longer a
peripheral concern for European security and strategy---it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly becoming [a **[central]{.mark}**
theatre [in the]{.mark} emerging [global order.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Europe is caught between Russia, which sees the Arctic as part of its
broader confrontation with the West; and the US, which under Trump is a
more hostile and transactional Arctic actor. Now
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [strategic interests [**directly
challenge** the EU]{.mark}]{.underline}'s [foreign policy objectives in
the Arctic.]{.underline} Climate policy, defence issues, multilateral
governance and energy security all converge in this one theatre.

Despite these shifts, the EU's Arctic policy is based on a strategic
document that dates back to 2021. This focuses on developing a
"peaceful, sustainable, and prosperous Arctic" and prioritises
environmental issues and scientific cooperation over defenсe and
protecting the security interests of member states. The lag, in turn,
hampers Europeans' ability to respond to what is fast becoming a
geopolitical hotspot.

Meanwhile, non-Arctic states, especially China, are seeking a stake in
the region through partnerships with Russia and long-term infrastructure
investments. This is part of a broader attempt led by Russia to shape an
alternative, illiberal Arctic order that stands in direct contrast to
Europeans' vision. EU and NATO member states control swathes of Arctic
territory, and some have begun developing their military capabilities.
But unless the European Union's tactics change, it still risks being
politically marginalised and strategically outflanked.

Russia's Arctic insecurities

Moscow often frames its foreign and domestic policies as defensive
responses to perceived threats, aiming to protect its national interests
and legitimate its assertiveness. As such, the Kremlin's actions provide
a window into its insecurities. These are particularly acute in the
Arctic, where concerns over nuclear military vulnerabilities and the
capacity to extract Arctic resources have massively influenced Russia's
policy rationale.

Military insecurity

[Russia's [relations]{.mark} with Western countries in the Arctic [have
been entangled in a **"security dilemma"**]{.mark}]{.underline} for over
a decade: actions taken by one state to enhance its security often lead
to countermeasures by others, **[[fuelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
cycle of tension and **[[militarisation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Russian expansion causes nuclear war. 

**Fazal '22** \[Tanisha M.; April 6; Professor of Political Science at
the University of Minnesota; Foreign Affairs, "The Return of Conquest?
Why the Future of Global Order Hinges on Ukraine,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest\]

There is reason to fear that [Putin's [ambitions
**go**]{.mark}]{.underline} well **[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
goals. As his remarks questioning the legitimacy of
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** as an independent country suggest,
Putin seems [[interested in]{.mark} much **more** than merely putting a
crony in charge of a former Soviet republic or **carving
out**]{.underline} parts of the [country; he]{.underline} may be
[contemplating **[redrawing]{.mark}** the map of **[Europe]{.mark}** to
hark [back to **imperial** Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Russia were
to take over the entirety of Ukraine, Putin would drive a stake into the
heart of the norm against territorial conquest.

If Putin went that far, then the fate of the norm would depend largely
on how the rest of the world reacted. Norms are nourished by
enforcement. In 2013, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad clearly violated
the norm against the use of chemical weapons (and international law)
when he fired sarin-filled rockets at the Damascus suburbs. Even though
U.S. President Barack Obama had declared the use of chemical weapons to
be a redline, the response to this violation was so tepid that one can
be forgiven for asking whether the taboo against chemical weapons still
holds.

Fortunately, much of the world's response to the Russian invasion
indicates that countries are largely united in their determination to
protect the norm. Unprecedented sanctions on Russia, combined with
donations of humanitarian aid and weapons for Ukraine, are applying
pressure on Putin while offering (admittedly limited) relief to
Zelensky. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} that international [[**resolve**
were to **ebb**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [countries that neighbor
Ukraine, such as [**Moldova**, **Poland**, and **Romania**]{.mark},
would **[rightly]{.mark}** become [nervous]{.mark}]{.underline} about
their sovereignty. Indeed, they already are. It is notable that the
international community has not banded together to repel Russia's
incursion the way a U.S.-led global alliance turned back Iraq's
attempted annexation of Kuwait. That move not only restored Kuwaiti
independence but also reinforced the norm against conquest. (Russia, of
course, is far more powerful than Iraq ever was and possesses nuclear
weapons to boot.)

At the same time, enforcing the norm against [**territorial
[conquest]{.mark}** [comes with]{.mark}]{.underline} tradeoffs, about
which everyone should be clear-eyed. Protecting Ukrainian sovereignty is
likely not worth a third **[[world
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**---especially [one [that could go
**nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The world should not [pay the
**ultimate price**]{.underline} just to support the norm against
territorial conquest. But the bloody costs that come with that choice
cannot be ignored. The West is currently walking a difficult line,
seeking to respond to Russia's invasion with strength but without
escalating the conflict.

#### Arctic conflict causes extinction.

**Shute '23** \[Joe; September 12; Ph.D. Researcher at Manchester
Metropolitan University; UnHerd, "An Arctic War is Coming,"
https://unherd.com/2023/09/an-arctic-war-is-coming-russia-china/\]

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. [The **era**
of]{.underline} "[Arctic **exceptionalism**]{.underline}" declared by
Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 [is]{.underline} resolutely
**[over]{.underline}**, his [entreaties for]{.underline} the [Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace]{.underline}" free from conflict and
exploitation [forgotten]{.underline}. As climate change accelerates and
Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [**cleaved** apart the
international **order**, [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[emerged
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the potential [[theatre of]{.mark} the next
**[global conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that [the global **race** to
plunder]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} could [have
**devastating** consequences]{.underline}. "If you don't co-operate on
the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll tell you this,
my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

**[Russia]{.underline}**, whose [territory **spans** around 53% of the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [shoreline]{.underline}, and
**[China]{.underline}** are rapidly [developing plans to expand
the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[R]{.underline}**oute. The maritime passage between the east and west
of the Arctic Ocean is regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions. It is already possible to navigate the route for anyone with
several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the mandatory Russian ice
breakers which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the
Kremlin is planning to commence year-round navigations of the route,
through which it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from
around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously [[declared
itself]{.mark} a "**near-[Arctic]{.mark}** [state]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of
the far north, while in March, a Russian delegation to India held talks
over new co-operation over the route. [[The **West**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly [flexing its muscles,]{.underline}
with [Finland]{.underline} (and the expected accession of Sweden)
[[extending **NATO's** borders]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Arctic. In
June, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the US
would be opening an outpost in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø,
stressing the need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic
Circle. "[The war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} has really
[[torpedoed]{.underline}]{.mark} this idea of [[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}," explains Dr Neil Melvin, Director
of International Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
"The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now shifted to
building security against Russia."

As Melvin points out, [the]{.underline} heavy losses [sustained by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s land army in [Ukraine will **force** it
to become [increasingly **reliant** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear force**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stationed [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "[[They]{.mark} will [feel more
**vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of not having a strong
army, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} I think we are likely to see them
[[**threaten** nuclear options]{.underline}]{.mark} much more as part of
national defence," Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They
are going to be much more **explicit** and threatening]{.underline}."

Beneath the ice, the Arctic possesses untold riches. The region is
estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas
reserves and rare earth elements such as gold, nickel and zinc. While
most of these are present within the largely undisputed land borders of
the Arctic nations, it is the [increasingly navigable international
**waters**]{.underline} that [present the most likely
**flashpoint**]{.underline}. An ongoing process led by a United Nations
commission is considering sovereignty rights to the central Arctic Ocean
between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is cooperating with the
process so far, he has also planted a flag in the most literal sense ---
dropping a titanium standard of the Russian Federation two miles beneath
the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007. Fishing rights are also key;
as southern oceans heat up, species will migrate ever further north,
causing estimated catches in higher latitudes to increase by up to 20
per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know we have [potential [**flashpoints** like
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} which, having caused agitation and tension
in the past, might be [**[escalate]{.mark}**d very
**[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from [[attacks on]{.mark} underwater
**[cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was
linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to]{.underline} an outright
[attack on [oil and gas **infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The
Norwegian European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is
most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[be]{.mark} the ultimate **opportunity** for Russia to test
**NATO**'s resolve]{.underline}."

Regardless of the [potential for **[nuclear]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline}, a burning Arctic poses grave threats for
humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland soils which are the
world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands store twice as much
carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns, it releases the
carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a doom loop.
According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, wildfires
across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere
between January and August, more than 25% of the global total for 2023
in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies [the **great
lesson** of]{.underline} the [far north]{.underline}, Professor Dodds
explains: nothing here ever happens in isolation --- [[there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} wider [[**ramifications** across the
**globe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Change in the Arctic is never
restricted to the Arctic itself," he says. "It is almost as if the
Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of [the Arctic]{.underline}
as a great pristine wilderness. Instead it has become the burning
crucible of our climate crisis. But, as the towering glaciers melt and
the seas of the Earth's fifth largest ocean are revealed to us at last,
their future looks even darker still, [reanimating]{.underline} the
[**bio**logical threats]{.underline} of our deep past, and
[providing]{.underline} yet another [site for]{.underline} human
competition and **[conquest]{.underline}**.

**[contest]{.mark}** between powerful states [over]{.mark}]{.underline}
the shape of [the]{.underline} future [[**global**
order]{.underline}]{.mark}. After World War II, the Allies established
[a rules-based international **order**]{.underline} rooted in
cooperative values and predicated on a framework of diplomatic and
economic rules, led and enforced by like-minded nations. This system has
enabled decades of prosperity for all nations that have elected to

**[revisionist]{.mark}** nation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The People's
Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and North Korea are each intent on
changing the international order to achieve their national ambitions.

[The changing]{.underline} strategic [environment]{.underline} has
[[created]{.mark} a wicked **[deterrence challenge]{.mark}** that will
test]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and its **allies**]{.underline}. These revisionist states are
dissatisfied with the current international order because they see it as
a threat to their own national objectives. Their ambitions pose a direct
strategic challenge to the continued security of the United States and
its allies because these nations are increasingly capable and willing to
use force as a coercion mechanism. [**Russia** is]{.underline} openly
[flouting **i**]{.underline}nternational [**law**s and
norms]{.underline}---including its own commitment to the 1994 Budapest
Memorandum---by [invading Ukraine, violating its sovereignty

China seeks to establish its own sphere of influence in the Pacific
region that excludes the United States and Western influence while also
attempting to resolve territorial disputes through coercion and
threatening behavior. The most serious component of these strategic
challenges for the United States is the modernization and expansion of
[both Russia's and the PRC]{.underline}'s nuclear arsenals. [For the

Wicked Deterrence Challenge

A wicked problem is one that is difficult to solve because of its
complexity, incomplete and changing information, multiple stakeholders,
competing and conflicting objectives, clash of cultures, or the
unprecedented or novel nature of the situation.2 Deterrence, by its very
nature as a function of influence over leadership decisionmaking, is a
wicked problem. Leadership decisionmaking can be impacted by numerous
unique factors, making the application of deterrence strategy more art
than science. As Keith Payne writes, "[There are **few**]{.underline},
if any, [universal **constants**]{.underline} in this regard; instead,
there is [a wide variety of]{.underline} operating
**[[factors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, some seen, others unseen,
[that]{.underline} can [**vary** greatly across time, place, and
opponent, and [may be **decisive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
determining]{.mark} if]{.underline} and how [**[deterrence]{.mark}**
will function]{.underline}."3

The emergence of the multilateral strategic environment and the need to
deter many nuclear actors simultaneously while continuing to assure
allies require the United States to rethink its deterrence policy. How
does deterrence policy need to adapt to address the changing multi-actor
environment? To begin to answer this question, analysts must start with
building an understanding of the strategic environment, including a deep
understanding of individual nations and the specific leaders the United
States seeks to deter. While this understanding will never be perfect,
it will reduce ignorance and provide a basis for designing a tailored
deterrence policy.

People's Republic of China

[[The **PRC's**]{.mark} meteoric **rise**]{.underline} has been
[motivated by its perceived need to **restore** its]{.underline}
rightful [place in the world **order**]{.underline}---to right the
wrongs done to China during its so-called Century of Humiliation. While
former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping articulated the PRC's strategy as
one of patience---the famous "hide and bide" strategy---current
President Xi Jinping has abandoned this approach, instead seizing the
opportunity to achieve his Chinese Dream of the "great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation."4 However, Xi views the current world order as an
unacceptable impediment to China's geopolitical ambitions and the United
States as a direct threat to its national security.5 The PRC views
Western and particularly U.S. influence in the Pacific region as a
violation of its right to act as the regional hegemon and an impediment
to unification with Taiwan. Xi envisions China as the rightful
preeminent Asian and global power. Xi's bolder, more confrontational
strategy has provoked responses both from regional nations concerned
about their sovereignty and security and global nations invested in the
current rules-based international order.

[The PRC]{.underline} has [[repositioned]{.mark} itself
[**politically**, **economically**, and **militarily**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} better enable it to [**[achieve]{.mark}** its
[aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The People's Liberation Army
(**[PLA]{.underline}**) has [undertaken a holistic military
[**modernization** of]{.mark}]{.underline} both [its [**conventional**
and **nuclear**]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}. Modernization
[efforts]{.underline} have been under way for decades, but they have
[increased to an **alarming** pace under **Xi**]{.underline}'s
leadership. [The PRC]{.underline} has [sought to]{.underline} develop an
ability to [forcibly **expel** Western forces and]{.underline}
ultimately to [prohibit their reentry]{.underline} into the region for
the purpose of securing its ambitions. Nuclear weapons forces are "a
strategic pillar of China's great power status," the linchpin in
excluding U.S. and Western interference, and ultimately serve as the
backstop to achieving its ambitions.6

[The PLA's rapid **development** of its]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal
[is]{.mark} the **[fastest]{.mark}** peacetime expansion of a nuclear
arsenal the [world has **witnessed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, going from
just a few hundred weapons at the end of the Cold War era to a projected
1,500 by 2035 if its current pace continues unabated.7 [These
developments will]{.underline} match, and in some areas qualitatively
[**exceed**, equivalency with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Xi has stated that he believes a robust
nuclear weapons program is critical to the PRC's ability to counter the
United States in the Pacific region. To this end, the PRC is [[investing
in]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanding the number of its
[**[land]{.mark}**-, **[sea]{.mark}**-, [and **air**]{.mark}-based
nuclear delivery platforms and [constructing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessary [[to
support]{.underline}]{.mark} this [major
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}.8

The PRC's nuclear strategy has been relatively consistent since it first
acquired nuclear weapons in 1964, relying on a minimum deterrence
strategy made credible by a small nuclear arsenal capable of delivering
a secure second strike. The PRC's declared no-first-use policy further
reinforced this public commitment to maintaining a nonaggressive
position. However, the PRC's rapid nuclear expansion calls into question
whether the PLA is still committed to this strategy.9 In his testimony
before the House Armed Services Committee, General Anthony Cotton,
commander of U.S. Strategic Command, articulated this point, stating,
"[The PRC's actions are wholly **inconsistent** with its]{.underline}
long-professed [policy of **minimum** deterrence]{.underline}."10 The
expansion of the PRC's nuclear arsenal opens myriad possibilities of
ways it could adapt its strategy to both deter and coerce other nations.
However, due to a lack of transparency and an unwillingness to engage in
dialogue, it is unclear what the PRC's intentions are.11

The PRC's potential to change its nuclear strategy cannot be understated
in the maturing global circumstances. PLA officers are writing publicly
about the need to articulate conditions under which nuclear first use
may be permissible or even desirable. These include exceptional
scenarios such as conventional defeat threatening regime survival,
conventional attack on a nuclear scale, or attacks on PLA strategic
forces.12 As a result, the durability of the PRC's long-honored
no-first-use policy may soon be limited or deficient. While PRC debate
surrounding this policy gets the most attention from strategists and
policymakers, there is also debate surrounding its "sole purpose"
policy, with PLA strategists debating the benefits of using nuclear
weapons to deter conventional conflict.13 The active debate in the PRC
about changing its nuclear policy coupled with a lack of transparency
and communication increases uncertainty and the potential for
instability.

[The **discovery** of 300 new]{.underline} potential intercontinental
ballistic missile (**[[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[silo**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [brought into sharp relief the
**extent** of the PRC's]{.underline} nuclear modernization and
[expansion]{.underline}.14 When complete, [these]{.underline} silos
[[will provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the PRC with [persistent
**readiness** and]{.underline} the [ability to conduct extremely
**[rapid launch]{.mark}** sequences]{.underline}. In addition to
investing in fixed silos, [the PLA Rocket Force is investing in road
**mobiles** and [expanding]{.mark}]{.underline} the number of
[[**launchers** and **crews**]{.underline}]{.mark} in each unit [at an
unprecedented rate.]{.underline}15 The PLA Navy's six Jin-class
ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) rotate through near-continuous
deployment equipped with JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs), though this platform is vulnerable as it needs to enter the
open Pacific in order to target the United States. However, the PLA Navy
is building the Type 096 SSBN, which will carry the updated JL-3 SLBM
capable of targeting the United States from Chinese littoral waters,
significantly increasing the survivability of its sea-based deterrent.16
Finally, the [PLA **Air Force** is [**reestablishing** its air
leg]{.mark}]{.underline} with the updated H6-N bomber, which will
complete a true regional triad. It is also [developing a new strategic
**bomber**]{.underline}, the H-20, but while specifications are still
unknown, it is clear that the PRC is intent on obtaining a credible
global triad.17 Beyond a traditional triad, [the PRC is
developing]{.underline} additional capabilities such as
**[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
missile**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, fractional
**[[orbital]{.underline}]{.mark}** [bombardment systems,
and]{.underline} the Dong Feng-26 medium-range ballistic missile with
both [conventional and [nuclear **payloads**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
could be swapped quickly in the field.18 While these capabilities are
not novel, they all have the potential to be destabilizing.

At the same time the PRC is modernizing its nuclear capabilities, it is
modernizing the command and control infrastructure to support it.
[Investments in **[ground-based]{.mark}**]{.underline} large
[phased-array **[radars]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the [ability to
detect]{.underline} ballistic [**[missile]{.mark}**
launche**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} with geostationary satellites [have
provided]{.underline} the PRC with [a comprehensive **[early
warning]{.mark}** capability]{.underline}.19 These capabilities make
credible the PRC's desire to shift to a "launch on warning" nuclear
posture, [[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. The U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission detailed the risk with such a posture,
stating that the "difficulties associated with learning to operate such
a system could generate false alarms about nonexistent incoming nuclear
attacks, potentially triggering a nuclear exchange between China and the
United States."20 [The PRC's **[unwilling]{.mark}**ness [to
enter]{.mark} risk-reduction **dialogues** and]{.underline} complete
[refusal to enter **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline} negotiations
[mean]{.underline} these [risks are left unaddressed]{.underline}.

Russia

[[The challenges]{.mark} posed [by **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the rules-based international order [have [been on]{.mark} full
**[display]{.mark}** since]{.underline} at least [2008,
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's [invasion of [**Georgia**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} again in 2022 when President Vladimir Putin
began his "special military operation" in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** to halt Kyiv's economic and cultural
progress toward the West. Putin views the U.S.-backed rules-based
international order as a threat to the Russian way of life. It is his
intent to renew the Russkiy Mir, the Russian world, and restore Russian
prestige and cultural and political influence in the vein of previous
Russian empires.21

The current revisionist and irredentist narrative in Russia argues that
Russia is a victim of U.S.-European hegemony and is besieged by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion in its periphery, a direct
threat to the goal of reestablishing the Russian world. The war in
Ukraine is a direct result of this perceived threat. Non-NATO and
non--European Union states with strong relationships with the West, in
general, have been less susceptible or receptive to Russian influence,
thereby diminishing Russia's status in its near abroad. At the prospect
of further NATO enlargement, Putin felt threatened to the point of
taking belligerent action. According to Dmitri Trenin, a member of
Russia's Foreign and Defense Policy Council, "What Russia craves is
respect. It does not want to be a junior partner---it wants to be an
equal."22

Despite significant initial gains in Ukraine, the Russian war effort has
endured countless tactical, operational, and strategic setbacks and has
begun to show clear signs of devolution into a protracted slog
reminiscent of the Korean War in the 1950s. A significant portion of
Russia's conventional capability has been degraded and destroyed by the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which could increase Putin's reliance on
nuclear capabilities for Russia's defense. The continued use of nuclear
saber-rattling by Putin and other Russian officials has effectively
deterred Western intervention and heavily influenced the type of
military assistance the West is willing to provide to Ukraine and
undermined Ukrainian resistance.23 As evidenced by steadily increasing
economic and material support from NATO, the effectiveness of these
nuclear threats is eroding. Putin's legitimate reliance on nuclear
weapons, however, coupled with robust nuclear signaling should not be
ignored or dismissed out of hand because [Russia's nuclear
weapons]{.underline} arsenal [remains a]{.underline} significant
[**existential** threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies
throughout Europe and the Pacific region.

[The **capability** and **credibility** of Russia's]{.underline}
strategic and tactical nuclear [forces make them a **serious**
concern]{.underline} that cannot be ignored. [[Russia continues
to]{.mark} invest substantial resources to expand and
**[modernize]{.mark}**]{.underline} its strategic and nonstrategic
nuclear [capabilities]{.underline}. Russia's modernization plan, which
has been in the works for over a decade, includes [improving **each
leg** of its]{.underline} triad of [nuclear **delivery**]{.underline}
systems and developing new and novel nuclear capabilities. For example,
the Sarmat is a new silo-based ICBM that will be capable of carrying up
to 10 nuclear warheads.24 Russia's strategic submarine fleet will
include an entirely new Dolgorukiy class of SSBN submarines equipped
with SS-N-32 Bulava nuclear ballistic missiles by 2028. The Tu-160M
supersonic strategic bomber aircraft has extended range and is equipped
with more capable onboard systems than previous iterations, and 10 are
already in the field.25 The modernization of the Russian nuclear force
has increased the capability and credibility of Russia's nuclear triad.

In addition to modernizing its legacy systems, [Russia is
[developing]{.mark}]{.underline} and improving its
[**[hypersonic]{.underline}** [and **other**]{.underline}]{.mark} novel
[delivery system**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These include new systems
such as the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Kinzhal
[**[air]{.mark}**-launched ballistic missile, and]{.underline} the
Tsirkon [**[land]{.mark}**-attack cruise missile]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Russia maintains over 2,000 non--treaty accountable---often
referred to as tactical or nonstrategic---nuclear weapons that provide
diverse and flexible use and deterrence options. In fact, it is this
very threat of tactical nuclear weapons that has caused NATO nations to
revitalize focus on both their conventional and nuclear capabilities to
ensure that the Alliance possesses a credible deterrent.26 [Both
Russia's [**strategic** and **t**]{.mark}actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}** are backed by]{.underline} a body of
**[doctrine]{.underline}** that explicitly lays out the conditions for
nuclear use, including possible first use in response to threats to the
"existence of the state."27

Since 1972, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet
Union, later the Russian Federation, has been partially stabilized by a
series of arms control agreements that provided mechanisms for building
trust and reducing risk by allowing some strategic predictability in the
relationship. For the first time in more than 40 years, U.S.-Russia
relations lack the stabilizing guardrails of these arms control
treaties. The last remaining arms control treaty regulating U.S. and
Russian strategic forces, [**[New START]{.mark}**, has **suffered** due
to]{.underline} the U.S. support of [Ukraine]{.underline} after the
Russian invasion. Shortly afterward, Russia began refusing onsite
inspections by U.S. personnel allowed by the treaty. Later, Russia
"paused" its compliance with New START and has since refused to begin
negotiations to extend or modify the agreement, which is set to expire
in February 2026.28 The [[expiration]{.mark} of strategic treaties with
Russia will]{.underline} not only [end]{.underline} self-imposed
[restraints, [potentially spurring]{.mark} an **[arms race]{.mark}**,
but]{.underline} will also **[eliminate]{.underline}** one of the most
important conduits for **[communication]{.underline}** between the
United States and Russia [[and]{.mark} set [conditions
for]{.mark}]{.underline} dangerous miscommunication, misunderstanding,
and **[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulation.

North Korea

North Korea has posed a consistent threat to the United States and its
allies since the 1953 armistice. The nature of this threat has
oscillated between moderate and acute but has remained consistently
hostile. The persistence of the threat and more acute emerging
challenges have unfortunately allowed some to become numb to the true
severity and magnitude of what a conflict with North Korea could mean
for the region and the United States. Conversely, North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un does not waver in his focus on the United States as the
perceived preeminent existential threat to his nation. To secure his
power and protect his regime, Kim continues to invest in and grow North
Korea's nuclear arsenal. [The growth of **North Korea**]{.underline}'s
nuclear power [goes beyond security]{.underline}. Jung H. Pak, a Fellow
at the Brookings Institution, observed, "\[Kim\] has elevated and
embedded nuclear weapons in both the popular consciousness and the
ideological, physical, and cultural landscape, enshrining them in North
Korea's constitution and has effectively linked them to the country's
perception of prosperity."29

Along with advancing weapons development, [[North Korea]{.mark} has
[continued to **advance**]{.mark} its nuclear program,
accelerating]{.underline} its **[[testing]{.underline}]{.mark}** program
while refining its nuclear doctrine. North Korea enshrines its nuclear
doctrine into law, the most recent update occurring in 2022 with the
establishment of the State Policy and Nuclear Forces. This law served as
an update to the 2013 Law on Consolidating Position of Nuclear Weapons
State. While the [2022 law remains consistent with]{.underline} the
earlier version in [**affirming** the role of **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} in deterring aggression or responding if
deterrence should fail, it also outlined the
[[situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that [could [warrant a
**preemptive**]{.mark} nuclear [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Most
concerning, the 2022 North Korean law details the potential for an
automatic nuclear response---often referred to as a "dead man's hand"
mechanism---should military commanders be unable to communicate with
leadership in Pyongyang during a conflict. This severely complicates the
deterrence and escalation management strategies of the United States and
its allies.31

Doubts regarding the credibility of North Korea's nuclear capability
should be discarded. [Each]{.underline} successive underground [nuclear
test has produced a larger **yield**]{.underline}, with North Korea's
last test in 2017 producing a yield of approximately 250 kilotons---10
times larger than the bomb used at Nagasaki in 1945.32 Furthermore,
[North Korea's delivery systems continue to **advance** as]{.underline}
the [nation adheres to an aggressive **testing** schedule]{.underline}.
In 2022, North Korea conducted nearly 100 missile tests, more than it
had ever conducted.33 North Korea is developing ICBMs capable of holding
the United States at risk and several intermediate- and medium-range
ballistic missiles capable of targeting South Korea and Japan. It is
also pursuing an SLBM capability, which would increase the survivability
of its deterrent.34 Estimating the size of North Korea's nuclear arsenal
is exceedingly difficult, as the regime is even less transparent than
that of the PRC. That stated, North Korea is thought to have anywhere
from 35 to 65 warheads today, with the ability to add up to 18 more
warheads per year.35 The international community should no longer
consider Kim a proxy of the Chinese Communist Party or a buffer state
puppet and must not ignore North Korea's unique national objectives.

Complexity in the Multi-Actor Strategic Environment

The PRC, Russia, and North Korea represent primary nuclear security
concerns for the United States and its allies because of those states'
abilities to threaten existentially and coerce effectively. In the
developing multi-actor environment, U.S. relationships with each of
these states do not happen in a vacuum. [The strategic **environment**
contains other **nuclear**]{.underline} weapons [states]{.underline},
including U.S. allies [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom and [**France**. **India** and
**Pakistan**]{.underline} are de facto nuclear weapons states, as they
are not signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), nor
are they recognized as sanctioned nuclear weapons states by the NPT, as
they acquired their capability after 1970. [There are]{.underline} also
[[**additional** nations]{.mark} that [may desire]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---adversaries [[such as
**Iran**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For its part, the United States extends deterrence with its nuclear
umbrella through collective defense treaties to the 31 (soon to be 32)
nations of NATO, as well as Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Thus, the
deterrent relationships are never bilateral, as is often misremembered
about the Cold War era, but instead contain the security concerns of
multiple actors. As numerous deterrence scholars have expressed,
including Thérèse Delpech, [[this **multi-actor**]{.mark} strategic
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline} "may [[make]{.mark} a
[situation]{.mark} more **[unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline} . . . as
\[multiple actors\] introduce more variables" into deterrence
strategies.36 In U.S. deterrence efforts, each
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** relationship [[must be
**tailored**]{.underline}]{.mark} for each state or actor and must
consider the nearly incalculable positions of allies and partners as
well as cooperators, competitors, and adversaries.

Cooperation between the United States and its traditional allies remains
strong and continues to grow. However, in the maturing multi-actor
deterrence reality, there is [increased **coop**eration
between]{.underline} and among the historically fiercely independent
[**PRC**, **Russia**, and **North Korea**]{.underline} in instances
where their strategic objectives align. These adversaries also have
their own strategic deterrent relationships beyond those with the United
States. China, India, and Pakistan form a deterrence triangle that
features China's and Pakistan's increasing cooperation while both
actively deterring India and each other. This [makes]{.underline} the
second- and third-order effects of [strategic **choices**]{.underline}
as [critically **important**]{.underline} as any deliberate direct
effort. [[Actions]{.underline}]{.mark} taken [[by]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates to
assure an Indo-Pacific ally [could [inspire]{.mark} the **[PRC]{.mark}**
to adjust]{.underline} its deterrent strategy,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[trigger **India**]{.mark} to
adjust]{.underline} its deterrent strategy,
[[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**ripple** effect
into]{.underline}]{.mark} its deterrent relationship with
**[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Understanding how the relationships
of adversaries, allies, partners, and third parties are interrelated and
connected is necessary to operate in the multi-actor strategic
environment.

America's military vessels brave contested waters, hurricanes, tropical
storms, and other chaos---so why is the presence of U.S. Navy ships in
the Arctic so limited? [[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all, is
no longer just vast icebergs floating around like sentinels of death,
surrounded by silence more oppressive than its cold---it [[is]{.mark}
now [a]{.mark} major geopolitical [**prize** in]{.mark} the **Great
Power Competition** between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [China, and Russia.]{.underline}

[The Arctic has relevance to **[every facet]{.mark}** of this
struggle.]{.underline} Energy? [The U.S. Geological Survey estimates
that [**one-eighth** of]{.mark} the world's untapped [oil]{.mark}
reserves [and **one-third** of]{.mark} its natural [gas]{.mark} reserves
lie in the Arctic.]{.underline} Trade? [The Arctic's three **[trade
routes]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the Northwest Passage]{.underline}
(above Canada), [the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (above Russia),
[and the Central Arctic Route]{.underline} (between Iceland and the
Bering Strait, through the North Pole)---[will soon subsume a
substantial share of shipping]{.underline}, by some accounts five
percent of global maritime traffic in 2030 and with no sign of slowing
down. Political-military risk? [The [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}n
[Navy]{.underline}'s elite [Northern Fleet recently
**[expanded]{.mark}** its area-of-responsibility specifically [to secure
the Northern Sea Route]{.mark}, and [China proclaimed]{.mark} itself a
"near Arctic" state as it begins to establish [a **"Polar Silk
Road"**]{.mark} of influence and commerce in the regio]{.underline}n
("near" does a lot of work there). In fact, [China and Russia are
cooperating in the Arctic,]{.underline} as evidenced by their joint
naval patrol near the U.S. Aleutian Islands in 2023.

The Great Powers in the Arctic

The [Great Power Competition in the [Arctic will be won with
**icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}---highly specialized naval vessels
capable of slicing directly through polar ice that would crush
traditional ships and withstanding "storms that can ice over
superstructures until ships become so top-heavy they capsize."
Currently, [complete [exploration, shipping, and patrol]{.mark} of the
Arctic [is **impossible** without them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, [there
is a stark imbalance among the Great Powers in their icebreaking
capabilities. China,]{.underline} located 800 miles away from the Arctic
at its closest point, [operates two existing icebreakers]{.underline}
(with a third on the way) and is developing nuclear-powered technology
for these vessels. [[Russia has]{.mark} a fleet of [forty-six]{.mark}
icebreakers, including three nuclear-powered ships for extended Arctic
patrols, and]{.underline} has recently [[launched]{.mark}]{.underline} a
new "class of [[**combat icebreakers** with]{.mark} high-speed guns and
launchers for anti-ship and land-attack cruise **[missiles."]{.mark}**
Both [Russia and China have **centralized** their]{.mark} icebreaker
[programs]{.mark} under their navies, underscoring their view of these
ships as military assets.]{.underline}

In contrast, [[America's]{.mark} icebreaker program is [in
**disarray**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. government has only two
operational icebreakers---the decades-old Polar Star and the Healy---and
neither of them are capable of year-round operations. [[Plans]{.mark} to
build a new fleet of six to nine icebreakers]{.underline}, through the
Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program, [[are
**faltering**.]{.underline}]{.mark} This joint venture between the Navy
and Coast Guard is vastly over budget and behind schedule, already
exceeding procurement cost by 39 percent, with the first delivery
expected in 2029---four years late. Unlike Russia and China, the U.S.
has no serious plan to equip its developing icebreakers with nuclear
power. Moreover, while the Navy has some involvement in procurement and
construction of the icebreakers, [the Coast Guard alone is responsible
for their operations. This is important because the [Navy is]{.mark} the
U.S. military's **[forward-deployed,]{.mark}** combat-oriented force,
while the [Coast Guard is]{.mark} structured primarily for homeland
[defense. This]{.mark}]{.underline} organizational [[divide
means]{.mark} that the purpose, posture, and [operational reach]{.mark}
of America's icebreakers are dangerously [**mismatched** with]{.mark}
those of its primary [adversaries]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}

The Need for a U.S. Navy Icebreaker Program

Accordingly, the U.S. [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and the President
[[must enact **legislation** requiring the Navy to build and operate its
own]{.mark} combat-oriented icebreaker [program to **secure**]{.mark}
our national interests in [the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [Navy is
**unlikely** to take on this role voluntarily.]{.underline} In 2023, the
former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, underscored
this reluctance when he deflected questions about icebreaker procurement
to the Coast Guard, making it clear that he did not view the program as
the Navy's responsibility. Currently, the Coast Guard is the only branch
of the U.S. military legally tasked with "develop\[ing\],
establish\[ing\], maintain\[ing\], and operat\[ing\] icebreaking
facilities." [[Without a mandate,]{.mark} the [Navy has]{.mark} shown
[no intention to ]{.mark}]{.underline}expand its footprint into the
[[icebreak]{.underline}]{.mark}ing business. Notably, Gilday's 2022
Navigation Plan, which outlines the Navy's strategic goals through 2045,
does not even acknowledge the Arctic as a major global maritime shipping
route, nor does it identify potential geographic choke points in the
region. In 2020, then-Secretary of the Navy, Kenneth Braithwaite,
acknowledged the importance of icebreakers in front of Congress, but
stated that "it is not a mission that is central to the United States
Navy" and is one it "rel\[ies\] on the Coast Guard to provide." However,
[[leaving this critical]{.mark} program solely [with the Coast
Guard]{.mark}]{.underline}---a service with less than 10 percent the
Navy's size and budget---[**[neglects]{.mark}** U.S. **[strategic
interests]{.mark}** in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[U.S. [presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [requires]{.mark} a
**[robust]{.mark}** naval [combat]{.mark} capability which]{.underline}
the [Coast Guard cannot provide alone.]{.underline} In his 2001
commentary on the differences between the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard,
Professor Colin Gray of the Naval War College identified three unique
characteristics of the Navy, all of which are implicated by the
icebreaker program.

First, the Navy "takes its tune ... from contro\\l (even command) of the
high seas." This means the first duty of "the premier navy, is to
control sea lines of communication---to allow or deny access to the sea,
thence across it, and finally to the land, where humankind lives."
However, [[without]{.mark} an active **[icebreaker presence]{.mark}** in
the Arctic, the [Navy]{.mark} is]{.underline} voluntarily [denying
itself full access to the Arctic [leaving]{.mark} [gaps for i]{.mark}ts
adversaries---namely [Russia]{.mark} and [China, to]{.mark} aggressively
expand and **[militarize]{.mark}** their icebreaker
presence.]{.underline}

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [Failing to establish a surface presence in the Arctic with
icebreakers could [yield]{.mark} an [**"asymmetric \[\] equalizer**" for
adversaries]{.mark}, a risk that becomes more imminent as polar ice
melts and access to the Arctic increases.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, ["the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it,]{.underline} however serendipitously." Russia and
China are actively moving the Great Power Competition to the Arctic:
[Russia is arming its icebreakers with anti-ship weapons and cruise
missiles, both nations are regularly patrolling the Arctic seas with
icebreakers, and heavily investing in nuclear technology for these
vessels.]{.underline} While icebreakers are certainly necessary for the
Coast Guard's missions---including search and rescue, navigation,
environmental protection, interdiction, and ice operations---[[Russia
and China have]{.mark} embraced [icebreakers as **dual-use
assets**]{.mark} that squarely address the Navy's purpose.]{.underline}
Moreover, [the [Navy and Air Force's existing]{.mark} submarine and
aircraft [presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [is **inadequate**]{.mark} for
the Great Power Competition]{.underline}. Submarines and aircraft alone
cannot "clear a path for critical shipping, respond to oil spills, or
conduct maritime safety and security boardings in the U.S. Arctic"---let
alone accomplish more strategic goals of sea control and power
projection in the region.

Separately from the mission, Congress and the President should also
require an independent Navy icebreaker program due to the Coast Guard's
ongoing struggles in procuring and constructing the vessels. This
summer, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
recently [[signed the ICE Pact]{.mark} with Finland and Canada [to
build]{.mark} seventy to ninety [new icebreaker]{.mark}s over the next
decade.]{.underline} While this agreement will help expand America's
icebreaker fleet, it relies on Finland---which can build a polar-class
vessel in two years at just 25 percent of the cost of in America---to
handle construction. [This [outsourcing is]{.mark}]{.underline},
frankly**[, [an embarrassment.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The poor outcomes
in the PSC program may stem in part from its joint structure: since the
Coast Guard operates the icebreakers, the PSC program lacks the Navy's
full commitment. [The [Navy hasn't]{.mark} fully [leveraged]{.mark} its
[**size**, **money**, **expertise**]{.mark} and [**influence** to
**drive efficiency**]{.mark} or accelerate]{.underline} progress of the
program, [while the Coast Guard remains constrained by the Navy's budget
authority.]{.underline} Furthermore, each service can deflect blame onto
the other in congressional oversight hearings, complicating
accountability for the program's setbacks.

In some ways, the PSC Program inverts the issues between space operators
and Air Force leadership that precipitated the United States Space
Force. There, space operators' lack of independence in the DAF---which
is traditionally led by pilots---meant space operations and acquisition
were deprioritized. With icebreakers however, [the [lack of]{.mark}
substantial [**direct involvement** by the
Navy]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially in operations---[[may be
depriving]{.mark} the [military]{.mark} of considerable [**influence**
that could **expedite** and **improve**]{.mark} the development of these
critical [vessels.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conclusion

The Arctic is poised to become a critical arena in the Great Power
Competition. Thus, to ensure the U.S. is strategically postured in this
region, incoming-President Donald J. Trump should work with Congress to
enact legislation mandating that the Navy build its own combat-oriented
icebreaker fleet---which, upon completion, can sustain a U.S. surface
warfare presence in the Arctic.

## Shipbuilding

#### Shipbuilding competitiveness is collapsing. Shreds military readiness and kills economic independence.

Decline: New Report Reveals Critical National Security Risks,"
https://gcaptain.com/u-s-maritime-power-in-decline-new-report-reveals-critical-national-security-risks/\]

A new report released today by the Open Markets Institute paints a
**[[dire]{.underline}]{.mark}** picture of America's diminishing
[[maritime capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, highlighting unprecedented
[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} to [national [**security** and **economic
independence.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Transportation policy analyst Arnav Rao's report, "Charting a New
Course: Steering U.S. Maritime Policy Towards Security and Prosperity,"
reveals startling statistics: while [[80% of]{.mark} U.S. international
[trade]{.mark} by weight travels by sea and [90% of]{.mark} military
[equipment relies on maritime]{.mark} transport]{.underline}, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[produces]{.mark} a mere [0.13% of]{.mark} the world's [large]{.mark}
commercial [vessels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[China]{.mark} has **[secured dominance]{.mark}** over
maritime logistics, [manufacturing 60% of new ships]{.mark}]{.underline}
and controlling crucial aspects including container production and port
crane manufacturing.

The situation has [already begun **[impacting]{.mark}** military
**[readiness.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In 2024, the Navy had to sideline
17 support vessels due to crew shortages. More concerning still, the
U.S. currently has access to fewer than 15 fuel tankers, despite
requiring over 100 for any major Pacific conflict.

#### The plan sets a [clear signal]{.underline} that revitalizes shipbuilding competitiveness, but a [certain]{.underline} commitment is key.

Jumpstarting American Shipbuilding New Report Finds,"

The recently-signed ICE Pact, focused on the development of
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, represents a unique opportunity to
[**[revitalize]{.mark}** American [shipbuilding]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
new report by the Wilson Center, a think tank, finds. It could [function
as a [test-bed for]{.mark} shipbuilding and policy
**[innovation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"If successful, ICE Pact will serve as [[a **model** for how]{.mark}
government [procurement]{.mark} programs]{.underline} for military
vessels [can [act as]{.mark} an [important tool of industrial policy to
help U.S. shipyards]{.mark}]{.underline} sell vessels to a wider array
of customers," the report concludes.

[U.S. shipyards face a formidable challenge to **[revitalize]{.mark}**
American shipbuilding and [**seapower** in a world]{.mark} increasingly
[dominated by Chinese]{.mark} shipbuilders]{.underline}. Shipyards in
China accounted for 75 percent of new commercial ship orders in 2024.

A key headwind for U.S. builders are the complex acquisition and
contracting rules combined with the lack of long-term funding stability.
The ICE Pact, short for Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, between the
U.S., Canada, and Finland looks to combine the strengths and
capabilities of their respective shipyards.

"The ICE Pact is the start of a procurement-to-production on-ramp that
will help bend downwards the cost of building ships in America," says
William Henagan, one of the report's authors and technical advisor at
the Wilson Center's Polar Institute.

[Polar [icebreakers]{.mark} can help [overcome]{.mark} American
shipbuilding **[inertia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to the report.
Apart from the fact that the [[U.S. is in **dire need**]{.mark} of a
dozen or more heavy and medium icebreakers, the vessels'
**[high-tech]{.mark}** and complex [nature]{.mark} represents an
opportunity to **[rebuild]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [American
shipbuilding]{.underline} [**[competitiveness]{.mark}** in high quality
vessels]{.underline}, rather than attempting to compete with China on
low-tech, low-value vessels.

Thus far procurement and lead-up to construction of the Polar Security
Cutter, as the Coast Guard's new heavy icebreaker is called, has been
anything but smooth, with more than half a decade passing from contract
signing to the first steel being cut.

But [**[a clear signal]{.mark}** from the U.S. government [for]{.mark}
the procurement of a fleet of [icebreakers]{.mark} in the present can
help [put]{.mark} American [shipyards in]{.mark} a [position to
participate in]{.mark} the [market for]{.mark} a **[growing]{.mark}**
global **[demand]{.mark}** of icebreakers]{.underline} -- estimated
between 70-90 -- in the future. [And in the medium-term that new
**[expertise]{.mark}** could [translate to competing for]{.mark}
international [military and commercial]{.mark} dual-purpose
[vessels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

President [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} recently [[stated]{.mark} that
the [U.S. will be looking to order 40]{.mark} big
icebreakers]{.underline} for the Coast Guard. [Even [a **firm
commitment**]{.mark} and funding for a fraction of this lofty goal would
send a key signal.]{.underline}

[**["Sustained]{.mark}** U.S. government **[focus]{.mark}** on the
production of vessels like icebreakers]{.underline}, undersea
construction vessels, unmanned underwater vehicles, and undersea cable
and repair ships [[remains]{.mark} the clearest route to putting
near-term 'points on-the-board,"]{.underline} the Wilson Center report
highlights.

"**[[The best tool]{.underline}]{.mark}** we have today [[to strengthen
the]{.mark} shipbuilding [industrial base]{.mark}]{.underline} in
America is procurement, but we also need new government investment,
adjustment to trade policy, and changes in labor policy. We need to
force military service branches to think about industrial policy --- not
just following bureaucratic procedures to put warships on the water,"
Henagan concludes.

As global geopolitical instability intensifies, [the U]{.underline}nited

**[pressure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The recent [focus on
**[revitalizing]{.mark}** the American **[shipbuilding]{.mark}**

[[need to **counter** China]{.mark}']{.underline}s
[dominance]{.underline} in the global maritime industry and the growing
power of the People's Liberation Army Navy. These developments raise
significant concerns about the U.S.'s capacity to maintain sea control,
especially as China continues to expand its naval capabilities and
assert influence over vital global maritime routes.

[[Long-term]{.mark} capacity to **[secure]{.mark}** sea lines of
communication (**[SLOCs]{.mark}**)]{.underline} and maritime
chokepoints---alongside the ability to field both competitive commercial
and naval fleets---[[holds]{.mark} significant **[strategic]{.mark}**
[implications]{.mark} for U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[interests in both peace and wartime.]{.underline} The
**[[shipbuilding]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector [plays a
**[pivotal]{.mark}** role]{.underline}, not only [[in projecting
**military power**]{.mark} but also in [ensuring **economic stability**
and]{.mark} maintaining global [**competitiveness**. Without]{.mark} a
[**robust**]{.mark} domestic [shipbuilding]{.mark} industry, [the U.S.
risks]{.mark} **[undermining]{.mark}** its ability to secure vital
strategic [objectives, such as]{.mark} securing
**[f]{.mark}**]{.underline}reedom **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**avigation [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
maintaining credible **[strategic [deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Furthermore, [reliance on [**foreign** vessels]{.mark} to carry trade
[exposes]{.mark} the [U.S. to]{.mark} the risks of economic
[**exploitation** and **coercion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
**[[compromising]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [national
**[security]{.mark}** and economic prosperity]{.underline} in an
increasingly volatile environment.

Despite a significant decline in shipyard output following the end of
World War II, the United States produced a robust 5 percent share of the
world's tonnage well into the 1970s. However, in 1981, a dramatic shift
occurred in the commercial shipbuilding landscape with the termination
of critical subsidies for the construction, operation, and financing of
international-trade ships built in U.S. shipyards. These subsidies were
part of Titles V, VI, and XI of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also
known as the Jones Act), which had long supported the industry. Once
removed, the U.S. commercial shipbuilding sector collapsed, leaving a
landscape dominated by a single customer: the U.S. government. This
[[decline]{.mark} not only diminished]{.underline} the U[.S. commercial
shipbuilding capacity but also [triggered]{.mark} a long-term
[**erosion** of industrial capability that]{.mark} has directly
**[impacted]{.mark}** the [naval sector.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
[result is an ill-equipped shipbuilding industry that has struggled to
meet both current and future strategic demands.]{.underline} With
restrictions on foreign shipyards for the construction of U.S.-flagged
vessels imposed by both the Jones Act and 10 U.S.C. § 8679, the United
States today finds itself dependent on an inward-looking, globally
uncompetitive industry.

#### Naval dominance [caps]{.underline} global escalation. 

**Cropsey '22** \[Seth; December 15; MA at Boston College, president of

for American Seapower at Hudson Institute; Real Clear Defense, "Global
Naval War,"
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2022/12/15/global_naval_war_870332.html\]

Because this [[conflict]{.mark} is Eurasian]{.underline}, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[naval]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Its
[**greatest flashpoints** are]{.mark} **enclosed [maritime]{.mark}
spaces**]{.underline}, [commercial and **strategic [nexus]{.mark}
points** in]{.underline} the [Eurasian littorals]{.underline} -- the
[[Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} and [Eastern
[Mediterranean]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Strait of
[Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[Bab-el-Mandeb]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [**[S]{.mark}**outh and **[E]{.mark}**ast **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**eas are all **crucial chokepoints** for **global
commerce**]{.underline}. The [[contest for
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark} may have landward elements, but it [is
**essentially [naval]{.mark}** [in character]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is [**readily [apparent]{.mark}** [in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} the CCP's [[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} has [expanded
its [capabilities]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [[**express purpose**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an [assault on [Taiwan]{.mark} and **concurrent
naval war** with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} and its allies.

It is marginally less apparent in Europe, where Russia wages a ground
war in Ukraine. Even in Ukraine, however,
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} objectives have been [[maritime in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not in character. Russia seeks to
conquer a country that, if added to its productive power, would give the
Kremlin a stranglehold over the global wheat, corn, barley, and
fertilizer supply. Ukraine added to the Kremlin's domain would also
provide it with an ideal base from which to dominate the Mediterranean,
play a decisive role in the Middle East, and regulate the Suez
chokepoint. Thus, even a power so decidedly continental as Russia still
employs a maritime strategy.

The United States can, in the abstract, encounter each threat
individually. Yet the issue is twofold.

First, these threats are likely to come in sequence. This may be
intentional: a coordinated trans-Eurasian campaign is possible. Indeed,
the issue of force coordinated is largely overrated. China and Russia
need not fight alongside each other in the same battlespace apart from
if Russia deploys its submarines to support China in the Western
Pacific. Hence the question is not of operational coordination or even
theater strategic coordination, but very general coordination at the
political level. It may also be opportunistic at a lower level.

Major power war will be foreseeable in an operational context: it is
hard to move masses of men and materiel to readiness without detection.
But smaller probing actions are more difficult to anticipate. Minor
revisionist powers, Iran for example, may take advantage of American
distraction and use limited capabilities to stress the U.S.' strategic
position. Larger powers may employ opportunistic pressure.

Second, these [[threats]{.mark} can be [deterred only
by]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**comprehensive [military]{.mark}** [prepared
for]{.mark} **large-scale [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S. military
is not prepared for this. It lacks the stockpiles, manpower, or
industrial base to sustain a major confrontation. Ukraine would burn
through American annual 155-millimeter shell production in two weeks,
and annual American Anti-Tank Guided Missile production in two months.
Unmanned Aircraft System platforms in Ukraine last three or so missions
and are destroyed at 90 percent. War is massively expensive and requires
a massive amount of equipment. This is true on land and at sea.
Platforms themselves are irrelevant if they cannot be sustained in
combat. And the U.S., with its atrophied industrial base, will struggle
to expand production within the next two to five years.

There is a **[significant [danger]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the [U.S.'
[allies identify]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[window]{.mark} of opportunity
[in which]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite its nominal military
superiority, it [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[stockpiles to]{.mark}
fight and [win]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[long-term major-power
war]{.underline}**. A multi-front war would be immensely stressful to
American capabilities. It may be reasonable to expect, despite
capability gaps that persist between the U.S. and its rivals, that a
coordinated campaign in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East would crack
the United States. [This can be [prevented]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[U.S.' ability to deter]{.mark} conflict]{.underline} should be
[[regained]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Meanwhile the [U.S. [Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} - the primary warfighting
arm for any future Eurasian conflict, [must be [**expanded** and]{.mark}
**[better-resourced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current NDAA is a start,
providing \$45 billion more than the Biden administration\'s initial
proposal. Yet this is, at best, a minimal initial move. The Pentagon
expects China\'s combat fleet to grow from its current level of 340
ships to 400 by 2025, or 20 ships yearly. Were the U.S. to build 20 each
year, it would reach --- in 2025 --- slightly above China's current
fleet size, but the Biden administration isn't even planning to build
half that number.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[shouldn't manage]{.mark} the [competition with China**; it should
win**]{.mark} it.]{.underline} [[Beijing]{.mark} is [pursuing]{.mark} a
raft of global initiatives designed to disintegrate the West and usher
in an [antidemocratic order]{.mark}. It is [underwriting]{.mark}
expansionist **[dictatorships]{.mark}** in [Russia]{.mark},
[Iran]{.mark}, [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea,
[and [Venezuela]{.mark}. I]{.underline}t has more than [[doubled its
**nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2020 [and is [building
up]{.mark} its [conventional forces]{.mark} faster than any country has
since World War II. These actions show that China isn't aiming for a
stalemate. Neither should America.]{.underline}

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are
violating.]{.underline} That means imposing costs on Chinese leader Xi
Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a [[cold war is
already being waged]{.mark} against the United States [by China's
leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a **[hot war]{.mark}**; they **[signal
complacency]{.mark}** to the American people and conciliation to Chinese
leaders]{.underline}. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will
not be won through half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires
openly admitting that [a **[totalitarian regime]{.mark}** that
**[commits genocide, fuels conflict]{.mark}**, and **[threatens
war]{.mark}** will never be a reliable partner.]{.underline} Like the
discredited détente policies that Washington adopted in the 1970s to
deal with the Soviet Union, the current approach will yield little
cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying their conviction that
they can destabilize the world with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[signed
a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline} In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a
redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. [[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the **[Russian war machine,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to
the U.S. State Department, [even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}

[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[, even [as those
regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war in
Europe.]{.underline} Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

[shipbuilding]{.mark} program]{.underline} has the potential to
[[support]{.mark} industrial [growth across]{.mark} a **[range of
sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including in places far afield from
coastal shipyards.

Stakeholders and [[policymakers **across**]{.mark} the ideological
[spectrum]{.mark} have recently [called for **investment**]{.mark} in
shipbuilding]{.underline}, providing a rare opportunity for bipartisan
policy solutions in Washington.1 But supporting shipbuilding and doing
it well are two different things. The latter requires sustained public
investment to rebuild the capacity of American shipyards, guaranteed
demand, and cooperation with the private sector to support ship
construction and provide meaningful benefits for workers and their
families.

The goal should be to create and sustain a more robust domestic
shipbuilding industry, not just to penalize Chinese-made ships. Rather,
the United States should invest in and sustain a world-class commercial
shipbuilding industry that can support American economic might and
provide good-paying jobs in communities across the country. That will
take far more than the tax incentives, tariffs, and fees that the Trump
administration has so far proposed.2

The U.S. shipbuilding industry is in crisis

The [[shipbuilding]{.mark} capacity]{.underline} of the United States
[has [declined to]{.mark} what the U.S. Naval Institute has deemed
**[emergency levels]{.mark}**]{.underline} and is in need of significant
expansion in order to meet the country's naval needs, as well as to
outfit a modern merchant marine capable of supporting a robust economic
resilience agenda.3 From 2020 through 2022, China consistently built
more than 1,200 commercial ships per year, while the United States built
fewer than six annually.4 China alone produces half of the world's
merchant shipping tonnage, but other countries also greatly outpace the
United States' ability to produce ocean-faring vessels.5 For example,
South Korea and Japan produced the second- and third-most ships in 2023,
with 28 percent and 15 percent of the global share, respectively.6 The
United States, which contributed only 0.1 percent of global shipping
tonnage, was bested by 13 other countries.7

FIGURE OMITTED

The result is that the United States is beholden to China for much of
its international shipping needs---and is beholden to a dozen other
countries for the shipping that China does not provide. In fact, less
than 2 percent of all U.S. waterborne imports and exports are carried on
ships registered in the United States, meaning that a foreign
jurisdiction manages the technical, social, and administrative affairs
of the vast majority of ships that service the United States.8 The Trump
administration acknowledged many of these shortcomings in a recent
executive order calling for the revitalization of U.S. shipbuilding, as
have both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.9

On the last day of the Biden administration, U.S. trade representative
Katherine Tai concluded an investigation requested by the United
Steelworkers to review China's state-sponsored shipbuilding program.10
In its report, the U.S. Office of Trade Representatives (USTR) stated,
"Beijing's targeted dominance of these sectors undermines fair,
market-oriented competition, increases economic security risks, and is
the greatest barrier to revitalization of U.S. industries."11

The Trump administration has adopted several policy positions outlined
in the Biden administration's report, although not always in the same
manner.12 On April 17, 2025, the Trump administration announced fee
levies per voyage, as opposed to per port entry. According to the USTR,
the fees will amount to \$140 per net ton for Chinese vessel operators
and \$33 per net ton for vessel operators of Chinese-built ships by
2028.13 The levy will be applied five times per year, at most, and is
not applicable to vessels arriving to the United States to carry bulk
exports or vessels carrying goods between American ports.14

Fees alone cannot reorient the global shipbuilding industry

The approach that the Trump administration's USTR has put forward will
likely be insufficient. Its focus on using trade remedies, however
innovative, is designed to limit only the presence of Chinese-built
ships in American ports, not to address the fact that 12 other countries
also produce more commercial ships than the United States.15 If the
United States wants a robust shipbuilding industry---and it should, from
both an economic and a national security perspective---it must do more
than single out Chinese ships for additional tariffs or fees. Trade
remedies will simply not be enough; nor will targeting only China's
market dominance. The United States must make consistent large-scale
investments in its domestic shipbuilding capacity to reorient an
industry that has moved away from the country for decades.16

There is, fortunately, an example worth emulating from the last time the
United States needed to dramatically scale its shipbuilding capacity.
The Liberty Ship program that the federal government managed during
World War II was wildly successful.17 It completely remade U.S.
shipbuilding in just a few years by not only focusing on establishing
reliable demand for ships but also investing in both the U.S. industrial
capacity to produce ships and the workers who made them.

The Liberty Ship program

On July 14, 1941, just six months after President Franklin D. Roosevelt
delivered his "Arsenal of Democracy" speech,18 Congress granted the U.S.
Maritime Commission the authority to manage ship construction. The
legislation provided for investment of federal funds in the
modernization of existing shipyards and the construction of new ones,
filling a hazardous gap in U.S. naval capacity. At the time, 90 percent
of vessels in the American Merchant Marine were more than 20 years old.
Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews, a decorated officer in the U.S. Navy,
described the Navy's equipment as inadequate, antiquated, and
deficient---a lot like how a U.S. Government Accountability Office
report describes the current state of naval shipyard capability.19

The goal of the Liberty Ship program therefore was to dramatically
increase the number of ships produced in the United States for the
merchant marine and the U.S. Navy. In total, 18 new shipyards across the
country were outfitted with new capacity paid for by the federal
government;20 by comparison, the United States operates just four public
shipyards today.21 The government then leased use of the shipyards to
private companies, which were responsible for constructing ships to a
specific government-provided design.22

At the program's peak in 1943, Liberty ships were built in just 30 days,
by private contractors at facilities created or upgraded with taxpayer
dollars.23 In some cases---almost unfathomably---construction of a new
seagoing ship took only 4 1/2 days.24 Today it takes the world's most
advanced shipyards one to three years to produce a seafaring vessel.25 A
world-class carrier, such as the USS Gerald R. Ford, launched in 2017,26
can take the better part of a decade to complete, not including the
years needed for design and procurement.27

It should be noted, however, that modern ships are far more complicated
than Liberty ships. The latter were not advanced; they were designed for
simplicity and made to be produced quickly. Yet their contribution to
the fleet was significant. Liberty ships transported a wide assortment
of wartime supplies across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including
ammunition, tanks, planes, food, and troops.28 In total, the program
produced 2,710 ships between 1941 and 1945, supporting the shipment of
more than two-thirds of material leaving the United States during the
war.29 After the war, many Liberty ships were converted to merchant
ships and continued to be used in civilian and military efforts.30

Why the Liberty Ship program was so successful

The Liberty Ship program owed its success to several factors.

First, by using public funding to outfit shipbuilding facilities, and
then leasing them to private firms, the government assumed the cost and
risk associated with upfront expenses, which can be significant in heavy
industries such as shipbuilding. The companies that agreed to lease the
production facilities were responsible for hiring employees and managing
construction processes. When a ship was finished, it was guaranteed to
be immediately purchased by the government at a set price and put into
service.31

In other words, the government used its resources to buy down the risk
associated with both supply and demand, allowing private companies to
focus exclusively on efficiency and production. Today, most government
support for industrial development is focused on one or the other, but
rarely both. One recent exception is Operation Warp Speed, the program
that helped to develop and distribute the COVID-19 vaccine.32 Operation
Warp Speed demonstrated what is possible when the government actively
supports all phases of a product's development, production, and eventual
deployment.

Yet procurement, while certainly helpful in ensuring demand for a
product once it is commercialized, still requires domestic producers to
cover the upfront costs associated with setting up a facility to
mass-produce a product, which, in the case of shipbuilding and other
large industrial enterprises, can be significant. And federal support
for creating new supply of technologies often takes the form of tax
incentives to encourage production; while these are helpful, they do not
provide the immediate injection of new resources required to rapidly
scale a new production capability.33

Second, despite the existential threat of World War II, the Liberty Ship
program invested in workers, recognized their collective bargaining
rights, and paid a fair wage.34 Working at a shipbuilding facility
constructing Liberty ships was a good-paying job that supported not only
the warmaking needs of the country but also the economic needs of
workers and their families. The program employed 1.8 million Americans
in unionized jobs between 1941 and 1945.35 Members of the merchant
marine earned more than Army privates and had average monthly salaries
that were competitive with those of other civilian employees.36

Third, at a time of very low unemployment because of the ongoing war
economy, workers received substantial health benefits, child care, and
affordable housing as a way to attract them to shipbuilding jobs.37
Henry J. Kaiser, the owner of several Liberty Ship shipyards, was one of
the first U.S. employers to provide health insurance to his employees.
Kaiser's "pre-paid medical plan" helped his firms compete for workers in
an era of wartime wage controls and was an early example of the
employer-sponsored insurance model ubiquitous in the U.S. health care
system today.38 After the war, Kaiser's medical plans became Kaiser
Permanente insurance. Kaiser also offered child care services and
housing to his employees worth \$40 per month, which was significant
considering that median rent in 1940 was \$27.39 Any new efforts to
bolster U.S. ship manufacturing should follow the example of the Liberty
Ship program and invest in care for workers.

Fourth, because many shipyard workers did not have prior experience
building ships, the Liberty Ship program implemented a large,
coordinated workforce training program to help workers and mariners
develop skills such as welding, knotting, sailing, and first aid.40 A
good shipbuilding program today should have a similar philosophy,
understanding that workforce training is about positioning workers for a
successful career, not just performing a rote task. Finland, an
Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE) Pact partner of the United States,
for example, offers a robust system of publicly funded workforce
training to welders and other potential shipyard workers---in addition
to workers in other specialties.41 By providing vocational education,
labor market training, apprenticeships, and work placements, the system
ensures that workers are equipped with the skills and knowledge required
for jobs in the immediate term and that they can find future employment
more easily.

Lastly, it should be remembered that the Liberty Ship program was
implemented in close coordination with partners and allies. British
shipbuilders were heavily involved in the design of Liberty ships, and
ships produced in the United States were used to support the operations
of several governments around the world.42 In today's broadly
interconnected economy, a similar commitment to cross-border
collaboration is required to do shipbuilding well. On the other hand, a
shipbuilding program that amplifies the Trump administration's
isolationist tendencies would miss out on the important benefits that
resilient cross-border supply chains can provide, as well as potential
export markets for U.S.-made ships.

Conclusion

The manufacturing landscape today is much different than that of 80
years ago. Many tasks previously performed by humans are now automated,
and manufacturing processes are more sophisticated. The country's
unemployment levels are far lower than prior to World War II.43 And
outcompeting others takes more than just dramatic increases in the speed
of production.

In today's global economy, it would be anachronistic to build simple
commercial vessels designed for speed of production over capability or
sustainability. Such a focus would limit the potential to use new ship
designs or new production techniques to lower emissions or improve
efficiency.44 Yet any major national effort to rebuild U.S. shipbuilding
capacity would do well to take into account lessons from the past on the
government's role in supporting both the supply and demand side of the
value chain, as well as provisions to support good pay, health coverage,
child care, and workforce training.

The U.S. shipbuilding industry has dwindled significantly after decades
of underinvestment, allowing China and several other countries to
produce far more commercial vessels than the United States. But
policymakers must do more than simply blame China for the lackluster
state of U.S. shipbuilding. It would be regrettable if the current
administration and its congressional allies missed out on the
opportunity to do [[shipbuilding]{.underline}]{.mark} in an effective,
bipartisan way, given the real benefits such a program [could

nearly **[every]{.mark}** component of a modern [ship,]{.mark} from the
**hull** and superstructure to internal support systems]{.underline}.
[[**American shipbuilders** rely on]{.mark} a steady supply of

[vessels]{.mark}]{.underline} like destroyers, aircraft carriers, and
submarines. While the [[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} does [[produce
**significant** amounts]{.mark} of steel]{.underline}
**[[domestically]{.underline}]{.mark}**, specialty alloys and certain
grades still come from global partners, including allies like Canada,

Today, [the world makes more steel every year, nearly **2 billion
m**etric **t**ons, than it did during the entire **19th century**; [the
**growth curve** for steel]{.mark} output this century [is]{.mark}
nearly **[vertical]{.mark}**, with global production more than
**doubling** just since **2000**]{.underline}. And despite a brief
slowdown in world production growth in recent years after the COVID-19
pandemic and thanks to stubborn overcapacity, [steel output [will only
**keep growing**]{.mark}, as the **appetite** for new cars, new power
plants, and new buildings **continues apace**]{.underline}.

\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>

Even as historic European steelmakers such as ThyssenKrupp scale back
their production to fight off cheap Asian imports, India plans to double
its production of steel to 300 million metric tons a year by the end of
the decade. That is the equivalent of adding the entire steel output of
Japan and the United States---the world's third- and fourth-largest
producers, respectively---in just the next five years.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which already makes about half the world's
steel, [[is spending]{.mark} **tens of [billions]{.mark}** of dollars
[to build **new**]{.mark} **coal**-fired steel [mills,
**despite**]{.mark} its own **[overcapacity]{.mark}**
issues]{.underline}.

\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>

Steel, which is basically iron mixed with a little bit of carbon to make
it stronger and more malleable, has been around in artisanal quantities
for centuries: The famous samurai swords and the blades using Damascus
steel were made by hand with high-quality steel. But production at an
industrial scale began in the middle of the 19th century with Henry
Bessemer's breakthrough process to cheaply turn pig iron into molten
steel. The flood of affordable steel allowed the rise of railroads and,
after a little more technical tinkering, structural steel that spanned
rivers and soared skyward.

Most of the world's steel plants today operate a blast furnace that uses
pulverized coke to turn pig iron into steel---essentially more advanced
descendants of Bessemer's first plants in Victorian England. [**More
innovative** plants today use electricity to **zap scrap** metal into
steel, a **less carbon-intensive** way to produce the metal but one that
requires **ready supplies** of affordable electricity and scrap
metal.]{.underline}

Either way, [the [uses are **endless**]{.mark}]{.underline}---literally
so, since [[steel is **infinitely** recyclable]{.mark}.]{.underline} A
typical car uses nearly a metric ton of steel[. A **double-track
kilometer** of high-speed rail needs 240 metric tons of steel. A wind
turbine uses about 900 metric tons.]{.underline}

"At its most basic[, pretty much **[all]{.mark}** your **[major
infrastructure]{.mark}**, buildings, bridges, energy systems, water
supply, all of this [is **built** with **steel**]{.mark},"]{.underline}
said Kevin Dempsey, the president and chief executive of the American
Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association. "[So what we need to
**live** and **move around** in and do our [**digital jobs** still
requires **a lot**]{.mark} of steel and even more **going
forward**]{.underline}."

Regardless of how close a nation is to the U.S. sphere of influence,
diplomatic initiatives, economic sanctions, trade restrictions and prior
military equipment sales have not reduced tensions.

**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**ne of these

[In regions such as [**Latin America** and **Africa**]{.mark}, U.S.
efforts are minimal]{.underline}: where the United States realizes it
has extraordinarily little influence, [it stands on the **sidelines** of
struggles hoping they do not **escalate** and [impact **national
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Deter" is an interesting term, used more commonly in the last 100 years
but originating in the 16th century from the Latin "de + terrēre,"
meaning "to frighten away" or "to frighten from." The premise has
remained unchanged over the years --- preventing an act or action by
implying an equal or greater punitive response, indicating the greater
cost to the act or action versus its potential benefit.

For example, mutually assured destruction, a strategy formulated in the
1960s regarding nuclear weapons, posited that nuclear powers would be
deterred from attacking each other because any attack would result in
devastating nuclear retaliation.

As we stand right now, deterrence against open threats to the United
States may be working, or perhaps there hasn't been an opportunity to
test the strength of its deterrence. But [**recent rhetoric** by
**Russia**]{.underline} [questions even the viability of **nuclear
deterrence** as a strategy.]{.underline}

Today, standing armies and large weapons inventories have an impact but
not as they did in the past. Stealth aircraft, near-silent propulsion
drive systems for submarines, troop strength and munitions stockpiles
have negligible deterrent effects on belligerent parties.

Sanctions of various forms only prejudice the innocent populous, which
sits outside the decision loop, against the United States.

We need to acknowledge that deterrence and such instruments as sanctions
--- as defined today --- are artifacts of the past and nothing more than
a façade.

Instead, [[**true deterrence** is]{.mark} best [found]{.mark} **deeper**
[in]{.mark} the **tool chest**, further back from military options,
economic sanctions and cross-table negotiations. There appears to be a
**correlation** between **deterrence** of aggressive actions and
**[industrial strength]{.mark}**. A nation's [**economic strength**,
**industrial base** and]{.mark} **production
[readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be]{.mark} the [**true genesis**
of]{.mark} projecting [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [because we
have **failed** to recognize the **true source** of deterrent power, we
have allowed it to **weaken** to a point where other nations are at
**parity** and thus **negating** U.S. **influence**.]{.underline}

Other nations now match U.S. industrial capabilities, innovation,
creativity and state-of-the-art technological advancements.

In addition, [the international community is not seeking **exports** of
U.S.]{.underline} durable [goods]{.underline} as in previous years.
[Demand]{.underline}, which generates growth, has [lessened]{.underline}
--- [**U.S. goods** are not as attractive]{.underline} as in the past,
[and this highlights a **loss** of our prominence in **innovation**
worldwide.]{.underline}

Currently, [the effectiveness of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies in deterring aggression is
being **questioned**]{.underline}. In answer to this doubt, [U.S.
**[inventory]{.mark} levels** [must be **replenished**]{.mark} to defend
national security interests [as]{.mark} the **[potential]{.mark}** of a
[**conflict** rises]{.mark}]{.underline}. To improve marketability, [we
need to lead with **state-of-the-art tech**]{.underline}nology.

[The best industry to blaze forward to new technical horizons is the
**defense industry**.]{.underline}

[Nations are turning to the defense industry to fill **[diminished
inventories]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but in the United States,
governmental financial constraints make this an impossible task. Reduced
defense funding [**hampers** or [prevents]{.mark} **stockpile
[revitalization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The current constraints on defense funding are the results of policy
decisions. For one, wartime supplemental funding in the United States is
not available for indirect or proxy conflicts, and unfortunately,
traditional deterrence, a flawed premise for preventing direct conflict,
has resulted in the ill-conceived justification for diverting funds from
defense to social endeavors.

[When deterrence fails, **industry** will be asked to
respond]{.underline}. Thus, [the **[underlying]{.mark}
pinnacle**]{.underline} but least-recognized instrument [of]{.underline}
[[**deterrence** is]{.mark} the [**strength** of]{.mark} a nation's
**economy** and [**production capability**. Industrial strength]{.mark}
as a **backstop** to **deterrence** [makes **negotiations**,
**sanctions** and **military**]{.mark} status [more]{.mark} likely to be
**[effective]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

But [[without **industrial health**]{.mark}, other [efforts are
**hollow**]{.mark} **expressions** unable to prevent the struggles we
are witnessing around the globe.]{.underline}

If international negotiations are to be sincere, sanctions to be
penetrating and military prowess to be acknowledged, then we must focus
on domestic industrial capability. The U.S. supply chain is now spread
out farther overseas than in previous years, which hastens the decline
in industrial capability and production readiness.

[**Relying** on **[imports]{.mark}** for components, subsystems and
systems [only **weakens**]{.mark} the **foundation** of
[deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The United States as a dominant economic power is slipping to the rise
of China. U.S. competitiveness has been ranked as ninth globally. This
position has been consistent over the years, but China's
competitiveness, according to multiple sources --- the World Bank, etc.
--- is gaining, closer to 25 percent now. Its annual percentage increase
in industrial production was 6.1 percent versus the United States' 2.3
percent, according to the CIA World Factbook. As far back as 2015, the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development highlighted China
exceeding the United States in global manufacturing. Manufacturing in
the United States is approximately 11 percent of the nation's GDP, and
the growth rate is 2.2 percent, which is below the world average of 2.9
percent, according to data from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.

The shuffle between rising and falling economic powers is a source of
potential conflict because previous deterrence power by one is no longer
a concern of the rising economic nation.

An Oct. 1, 2023, article by Ling Chen and Miles Evers, titled, "Wars
Without Gun Smoke," describes economic statecraft as it relates to
global widening of the supply chain. Trade restrictions are an effort to
slow the rise of competitive nations economically and in turn preserve
U.S. deterrence capabilities for actions contrary to U.S. national
security.

Strengthening U.S. manufacturing is only possible by increasing demand
for products, and demand is a function of attractiveness, utility and
innovation. In the last several decades, U.S. policymakers have looked
more to the commercial sector to advance technology that can be applied
toward defense requirements.

Although commercial innovation cannot be overlooked, it should not be
viewed as an offset to defense research and development, which by its
nature is specifically targeted to thwart potential threats to national
security.

In the 1970s --- with the Cold War a major concern --- the [defense
industry **led the way** in the **pursuit** of]{.underline}
state-of-the-art **[tech]{.underline}**nology, for example, [creating
**GPS** and the **[internet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As time passed and
the Cold War ended, the government shifted its attention to reaping
benefits from the commercial sector's exploration and advances in
technology.

The [use of defense tech]{.underline}nology [applied]{.underline} dually
[in the commercial sector]{.underline} and in defense has now
[flip-flopped to where]{.underline} [commercial products, such
as]{.underline} **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle[[**s**,
**cyber**]{.mark}**security**]{.underline} technology [[and]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**]{.mark}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[are]{.mark} now [**applied**
to defense.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [defense industry has been **relegated** to a **fast-follower
position**.]{.underline} This shift has been the justification for
drawing down government-sponsored defense industry research and
development. Science and innovation funding was approximately 4 percent
of the 2022 defense budget --- a number insufficient to sustain even
small companies focused on advancing promising technology and likewise
below a threshold allowing larger firms to continue specific targeted
development, according to a McKinsey & Company Nov. 4, 2022, article
authored by Eric Chewning, Will Gangware, Jess Harrington and Dale
Swartz.

The shift toward relying on the commercial sector for innovation has
also lessened dependence on U.S. technology worldwide and fostered a
desire or preference for overseas-manufactured products.

U.S. strength in advanced technology development and manufacturing has
dropped from its peak position. To halt this decline and regain our
prominence, governmental policies must encourage industry by supplying
favorable tax credits, an improved regulatory environment and reduced
energy costs.

In cross-table international discussions of commercial and defense
issues, the United States has been relegated to a peer level of
importance instead of remaining the leader. A nation with declining
industrial strength is viewed as having little value in actions that can
avoid turbulence. Any [previous [influence]{.mark}]{.underline} the
United States had [[in]{.mark} shaping **[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} preserving global]{.underline} [[**stability** has]{.mark}
been [**weakened** by]{.mark} its [diminished **industrial
base**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The administration seeks to avoid direct military involvement;
therefore, [emphasis must be placed on economic **fortitude** across all
manufacturing sectors, with special consideration of responsiveness in
times of **conflict**.]{.underline}

The recipient of increased funding should be the defense industry
because of its history of tackling technical challenges, innovating
solutions and creating a supply chain that is predominantly domestic for
national security reasons. Defense contractors are less sensitive to
pressure from investors who are seeking shorter development cycles, and
they have extensive experience solving complex engineering challenges.

The defense establishment, both governmental and industrial players,
have worked together for decades developing state-of-the-art technology,
retiring risk, adjusting milestones and fostering technical expertise
within the workforce.

With the introduction of each new product, the
**[domestic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[international
marketplace]{.underline}** will [respond]{.underline} positively,
[increasing]{.underline} **[demand]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
strengthening U.S. **[industrial strength]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [deterrence power.]{.underline}

[Domestic economic health is a **critical component** of
deterrence.]{.underline}

The next opportunity for the United States to test this hypothesis may
be approaching: [China is **quickly positioning** itself to **negate**
any response]{.underline} by the United States [to its South **Pacific
expansion**. [Stopping]{.mark} a **potential
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} before it starts [[and]{.mark}
**stemming**]{.underline} any **[escalation]{.underline}** of
hostilities [[must be]{.mark} the]{.underline} United States'
[**[objective]{.mark}** and, with it, the realization that its
[industrial growth is the **center**]{.mark}**piece** of our
**deterrence** strategy]{.underline}. ND

#### Stagnation unleashes [intentional]{.underline} AND [miscalculated]{.underline} nuclear wars.

**Skaperdas '20** \[Stergios; June 16; Professor of Economics at the
University of California Irvine, former Director of the Center for
Global Peace and Conflict Studies; Peace Economics, Peace Science and
Public Policy, "The Decline of US Power and the Future of Conflict
Management after Covid," vol. 26\]

Whether the pandemic ends soon or is longer-lasting, [the [global
**economy** and]{.mark}]{.underline} global [**geopolitics**
are]{.underline} very [likely to have a **different shape**
than]{.underline} they had [before its onset. The high [likelihood
of]{.mark} a [world **depression**]{.mark} and the **differential
responses** across countries]{.underline} -- especially those of China
and the US -- [[is changing]{.mark} the]{.underline} existing
[**distribution of [power]{.mark}** across the world]{.underline}.

After going over recent trends in the US's superpower status, I will
discuss the pandemic's implications for the rise of China as a
challenger to the US's position and a consequent urgent importance for
improving global conflict management. [Urgency is justified because
international institutions]{.underline} have **[atrophied]{.underline}**
over the past few decades [whereas the [possibilities for **conflict**
are **expanding**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

During the late 90's when many thought that the end of US dominance was
ending, Wohlforth (1999) argued well that unipolarity -- with the US as
the sole superpower -- was likely to last for decades. More recently,
Brooks and Wohlforth (2016) noted that "\[T\]he United States currently
has defense pacts with sixty eight countries -- a security network that
spans five continents, contains a quarter of the Earth's population, and
accounts for nearly three-quarters of global economic output." Bleckley
(2018) even asserts that unipolarity will last for the rest of this
century.

I don't confront the debate on "unipolarity" here. However, with the
rapid economic growth of China and the emergence of Russia as a military
and diplomatic competitor to the US in Eurasia, the US's dominance in
Eurasia cannot be taken for granted. If anything, as I will argue, the
trends over the past two decades have been more negative for the US than
is commonly recognized. With Eurasia having nearly 70 percent of the
world's population and about the same in total GDP (at PPP, IMF 2020),
it will be no longer possible for a non-Eurasian power to dominate the
world's economics and geopolitics by itself.

1 Trends before the Pandemic

I will discuss recent trends relating China to the US in terms of three
dimensions that are often used to assess great power status: the
economy, military capabilities, and technology.

1.1 Economy

China has been quickly catching up with the US in its economy. In fact,
by the beginning of 2020, China's GDP at PPP was 37 percent higher than
that of the US (IMF 2020). While GDP at nominal exchange rates might be
better in projecting economic power, GDP at PPP is better in gauging the
actual productive capacity of an economy.

The trend, however, that has been in favor of the US lately, has been
the enhanced status of the US dollar as a reserve currency,
paradoxically since 2008. The currency swaps between the Fed and other
Central Banks -- to help primarily the banks of US allied countries --
appears to have been the major factor in this trend (Tooze 2018). This
financial power has been increasingly used in sanctions against
adversaries but even Allies.

1.2 Military

China has been rapidly modernizing and expanding its conventional forces
but is very far away from becoming a peer to the US militarily.

The US has maintained its extraordinary predominance to move military
resources by sea, land, and air throughout the world. However, the
actual ability for the US to force its will on others has been shown to
be limited recently. It can barely hold onto its troops in Afghanistan
and Iraq and has had limited influence in Syria and in Libya. The fact
that, after the assassination of Iranian General Suleimani, Iran was
allowed to hit the US Al-Asad military base in Iraq (with apparently
pretty accurate missiles) without any reaction shows the limits of US
power projection. I suspect this is the first time that the US had one
of its bases hit by another sovereign state without retaliating against
them. While Iraq could be occupied, Iran is unlikely to be so -- it is
three times as big and populous as Iraq and its invasion would involve
many additional complications.

Moreover, [US aircraft **[carriers]{.mark}** and **bases** [are
vulnerable to]{.mark} increasingly accurate missiles not just from
[**Russia** and **China**]{.mark} but from **Iran** as well.
**[Hypersonic]{.mark}** missile[s are]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[deadlier, with Russia and China being]{.underline} reportedly
**[ahead]{.underline}** of the US [in their development. With such
**vulnerabilities** the US's ability to **project** military **power**
in Eurasia becomes]{.underline} much more [limited. It would be **no
exaggeration** to say that it is ["**game over**"]{.mark}
for]{.underline} the US's projecting [military power in Eurasia
without]{.underline} the expectation of [a challenge]{.underline}.

Finally, the relatively small wars that US have already entered have
been extremely costly. The cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to US
alone was estimated 10 years ago by Stiglitz and Bilmes (2012) to be
between \$4-6 trillion, a quarter to 40% of US GDP at the time.

1.3 Technology

While the US was far ahead of China in technology and basic research
barely a few years ago, China has been rapidly catching up. For example,
one respectable index of current high-quality research is the Nature
Index (natureindex.com) which includes articles only in the top natural
science journals. In 2012 China's scientific productivity was at 24% of
the US but by 2019 it was 67% of the US's level. This is likely a much
better level than the Soviet Union ever achieved relative to the US. In
technological disciplines such as computer science and AI China is
likely in even better place.

Furthermore, China has been demonstrating the ability to rapidly learn
how to adapt foreign technologies and implement them in production at
large scale. Highspeed rail, for instance, expanded from nothing to a
30,000 km network within a decade, while pushing the technology to new
limits. The US by contrast seems to have largely divested itself of the
necessity of maintaining primacy in engineering and manufacturing. The
US's emphasis on expensive high-tech weaponry is largely driven by
military-industrial complex rent-seeking and is, at best, a gamble that
would have highly uncertain returns in a hypothetical conventional
battlefield.

Overall, [China]{.underline}, while still markedly militarily inferior,
[has become at least an **equal** to the US **economically** and has
been **catching up** rapidly in **technology**, while Russia has been
counter-balancing]{.underline} the US militarily and diplomatically [in
Eurasia]{.underline}.

2 Effects of the Pandemic

[The pandemic]{.underline} has [brought about
**Depression**]{.underline} levels of unemployment [in the
US]{.underline} in record time [and]{.underline} almost all [countries
are facing **severe contraction**]{.underline}.1 Employment is unlikely
to reach its pre-pandemic level for a long time and, because this is
happening simultaneously around the world, there is no single large
country or region that could help lift the rest of the world with its
demand.

[**However**, in relative terms **China** and East Asia have been **less
affected**]{.underline} thus far [and will continue to do so
as]{.underline} long as [they maintain a **better**]{.underline} health
policy [**response** to the pandemic]{.underline}.2 China will likely
have to restructure its economy to be less dependent on existing supply
chains, rapidly expand the Belt-and-Road initiative, and expand its
social welfare so as to rely more on internal demand for continued
growth. Nevertheless, although all predictions now can be expected to
have high variance, [China is likely to **come out** in the end
**economically better off** relative to the US]{.underline}.

Other widely discussed probable effects include the strengthening of the
nation-state and a retreat of globalization in production, trade, and
capital movements. [We can envision]{.underline} scenarios from
[a]{.underline} mild [**retreat** of globalization with]{.underline}
shorter supply chains to [a full blown new **Cold War**
with]{.underline} two or more [separate **economic
blocks**]{.underline}.

Regardless of what the medium and long run will look like, the pandemic
appears to have accelerated pre-existing trends of US declining power to
the extent that we cannot say that there is one superpower dictating the
international politics and economics of Eurasia. China and, secondarily,
Russia will have much to say about how the global political economy
evolves. Under such conditions opportunities for conflict increase and
institutions of conflict management become ever more important.

3 The Alarming Future of Conflict Management

US policy until recently was as if the liberal trade hypothesis were
true and there was no chance of an adversarial relation with China in
the future. That is consistent with a neoclassical economic perspective
according to which more trade is always better. However, [trade policy
**cannot** be separated from **security considerations** when there is
the possibility of insecurity]{.underline} (Garfinkel et al. 2015;
Skaperdas and Syropoulos 2001). Now US policy seems to have been
reversed with China being treated, not as trade partner, but effectively
as an enemy.

In such a case [international institutions]{.underline} of conflict
management would be important for reducing the chance of conflict,
reducing the costs of arming, and allowing for smoother trade relations;
most of all, [for **minimizing** the chance of **nuclear
war**]{.underline}. Those institutions, however, [have gradually
**atrophied** or]{.underline} have [been]{.underline} intentionally
[boycotted]{.underline} during the time of US dominance. Over the past
two decades, for example, and contrary to previous practices the US
entered a number of wars without UN Security Council resolutions
(including those that it could have obtained agreement such as the
Afghanistan war). The recent withdrawal from the WHO, and the series of
withdrawals from arms-control agreements (ABM, INF, Open Skies, and
perhaps START) are other examples of the weakening of international
institutions. Perhaps this is to be expected of a world hegemon, but the
unilateralism appears to have increased while US power has been
decreasing and the need for future restraint on all has become more
visible. The conditions appear to be leading to a "bad" equilibrium
without investments in conflict management and high probability of
conflict as opposed to a "good" equilibrium with investments in conflict
management and low probability of conflict (Genicot and Skaperdas 2002).

The times we are now have similarities with the pre-WWI period which
combined a high degree of globalization with the absence of institutions
of conflict management (instead of their atrophy that we now have). At
the time, there was a wide-spread belief that economic interdependence,
and the break of that interdependence and other costs that war brings
about, would by themselves guarantee peace (see, e.g., Angell 1913). Yet
war came unexpectedly and with a vengeance.

[With the **dismantling** of]{.underline} previous [arms control
agreements]{.underline}, without good prospects for their replacement in
the future, and the weakening of the UN and other international
organizations, [the [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} and challenges [facing
the world [include]{.mark}]{.underline} the following:

- [[Multiple]{.mark}-pronged **[arms races]{.mark}** that go beyond
  **[hypersonic]{.mark}** weapons to **[cyber]{.mark}weapons**,
  **[a]{.mark}**utonomous **[w]{.mark}**eapon
  **[s]{.mark}**ystems]{.underline}, other AI technology-enabled
  systems, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} deployments in [outer
  **[space]{.mark}**. The costs and]{.underline}, most important, the
  [multiple **uncertainties**]{.underline} that such [arms
  races]{.underline} can [generate are of immense risk. Highly **risk
  [averse]{.mark}** [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}, perhaps [as a result
  of a **mistake**]{.underline} or misunderstanding but not only so,
  [[could **launch wars**]{.mark} from which there might be **no going
  back**]{.underline} (Mearsheimer 2001; Wong et al. 2020).

- In the absence of nuclear weapons treaties, the only restraint on
  nuclear war is Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). With new platforms,
  such as hypersonic missiles, that make possible delivery of nuclear
  weapons faster than it ever has been, could there be a greater
  temptation for a first strike (thinking that retaliation would never
  come)? [[Many]{.mark} examples of **preconceptions**, [**mishaps**,
  and]{.mark} **near-[accidents]{.mark}** from the 1950s]{.underline}
  and 60s that were not previously known (reported in Ellsberg 2017)
  [show how the world]{.underline} we are now entering [is]{.underline}
  likely [more dangerous than the Cold War]{.underline} ever was.

- [[A scramble]{.mark} for trading partners]{.underline} and Allies
  across the world that could go beyond just the offering of carrots.
  The undermining of governments that are perceived to be unfriendly by
  one side and their shoring up by the other side often [[leads
  to]{.underline}]{.mark} less autonomy, externally-induced political
  conflicts, increased [authoritarianism, and]{.underline} not
  infrequently to [outright **[civil war]{.mark}**. The danger of **many
  [countries]{.mark}** [in **Eurasia**, **Africa**, and]{.mark} **Latin
  [America]{.mark}** [becoming **battlegrounds** for]{.mark} continual
  **proxy [conflicts]{.mark}** between]{.underline} the [superpowers is
  increasing]{.underline}.

#### Icebreakers are [specifically]{.underline} key. Only a shift towards high-tech shipbuilding can counter China's race to the bottom.

Improvements to the Competitiveness of American Shipbuilding Starting
with Polar Icebreakers," pdf\]

Why Icebreakers?

For one, [America needs more [icebreakers]{.mark} now to [meet]{.mark}
its national **[security needs]{.mark}** in the polar
regions.]{.underline} But [from a shipbuilding industrial policy
perspective, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} also [learn to [export]{.mark}
[American]{.mark}-built [vessels that **compete**]{.mark} globally on a
cost and quality basis.]{.underline} The U.S. government must therefore
help American shipyards bend the cost curve downward towards competitive
parity for vessels that private companies and allied governments want to
buy. Today, [[it is]{.mark} two-to-four times more [**expensive** to
build]{.mark} a vessel [in America]{.mark} than in leading shipbuilding
nations]{.underline} like China, South Korea, and Japan, though it is
worth highlighting this sobering disadvantage stems in part from Chinese
production subsidies and market distortions. China directly subsidizes
its shipyards, and the subsidized Chinese steel that all three leading
shipbuilding nations use to build vessels helps keep commercial vessel
prices depressed.

State-subsidized competitors create two problems: costly U.S. military
acquisition programs (by comparison to peers and adversaries) and a weak
U.S. commercial shipbuilding industrial base. In recent years, the
National Security Council, Department of the Navy, and other U.S.
government agencies led a sustained effort to address the interplay
between these two challenges by identifying ways to rebuild the
commercial shipbuilding industry, so a sufficiently dense and capable
American shipbuilding industrial base can sustain the perennial demands
of U.S. military shipbuilding. These efforts identified that
[**[high-tech]{.mark}**, complex vessel [classes]{.mark} capable of
[providing **high-value**]{.mark} commercial or military
[services]{.mark} were an obvious place [to start rebuilding]{.mark}
American **[competitiveness]{.mark}** in shipbuilding. [The
alt]{.mark}]{.underline}ernative [[was a race to the bottom]{.mark} with
China to subsidize the production of lower value commercial
ship]{.underline}s, for which prices and margins are tied to the freight
rates for containers and commodities, at the expense of America's allies
in Korea and Japan who currently compete head-to-head with Chinese
shipyards in this market segment. [Sustained U.S. government [focus
on]{.mark} the production of vessels like
**[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, undersea construction vessels,
unmanned underwater vehicles, and undersea cable and repair ships
[[remains]{.mark} the [**clearest route** to putting]{.mark} near-term
'**[points- on-the-board']{.mark}**]{.underline}---meaning an increase
in the tonnage of vessels built in the United States and competitively
exported abroad.

The Procurement-to-Global Production On-Ramp

Today, the global commercial shipbuilding market is around a \$150B a
year business, and nearly 75% of new orders went to shipyards in the PRC
in 2024. U.S. shipyards build 0.2% of commercial vessels by tonnage, but
the global military shipbuilding market is a comparable \$80B a year
business---and, due to domestic build and content requirements, American
shipyards book over 40% of this work on an annual basis. That means, by
revenue, some of the largest shipbuilders in the world are either based
or have facilities in the United States, servicing over \$33B a year in
U.S. government demand for U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels. Similar to
the way foreign military sale processes support demand for American
built weapons platforms and fighter jets, ICE Pact envisions using
[[procurement programs]{.underline}]{.mark}---in this case the Polar
Security Cutter or future Arctic Security Cutter program---to
[[help]{.mark} American-based shipyards both [meet]{.mark} U.S.
government [demand and sell vessels]{.mark} abroad.]{.underline} Initial
estimates suggest [[governments]{.mark} around the world]{.underline},
excluding Russia, China, DPRK, and Iran, [[plan to buy]{.mark} as many
as **[70-90]{.mark}** icebreakers and ice-capable vessels within the
next ten years for operations in both polar regions. [If U.S]{.mark}.
government demand [helps]{.mark} U.S. [shipyards **specialize**]{.mark}
in the production of a vessel that other countries want[, those
yards]{.mark} have an opportunity to [compete for]{.mark}
[international]{.mark} military and commercial [orders]{.mark} for
dual-purpose ships like icebreakers]{.underline}. If successful, [ICE
Pact will serve as a model for how government procurement programs for
military vessels can act as an important tool of industrial
policy]{.underline} to help U.S. shipyards sell vessels to a wider array
of customers.

WHAT IT TAKES

This strategy will require investment. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs to]{.mark} maintain the defense
capabilities sufficient to [deny]{.mark} [China, Russia,]{.mark} and
[Iran]{.mark} their [strategic goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} The war in
Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in the U.S. defense industrial base that
must be remedied. Critical reforms need to be made to the defense
budgeting process, which is inadequate to this task. Congress must
strive to enhance the Defense Department's long-term strategic planning
process, as well as its ability to adapt to evolving threats. The
Pentagon should also work with Congress to gain greater efficiencies
from the amount it already spends. Costs can be reduced in part by
speeding up the Pentagon's slow procurement and acquisition processes so
that the military can better harness the remarkable technology coming
out of the private sector. Beyond military capabilities, the United
States must rebuild the other elements of its diplomatic toolkit---such
as information operations---that have eroded since the Cold War.

[The United States and other democracies must [win the
tech]{.mark}nological arms [race, since]{.mark} in the future,
transformative technologies [will be the most important source
of]{.mark} national [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. The debate about the
balance between regulation and innovation is just beginning. But while
the possible downsides should be acknowledged, [ultimately it is [more
important to unleash]{.mark} these [tech]{.mark}nologies' potential
[for]{.mark} [societal good and]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Chinese progress can be slowed but not
stopped]{.underline}, and the United States will have to run fast and
hard to win this race. [[Democracies will in]{.mark}vestigate these
technologies, call congressional hearings about them, and [debate their
impact]{.mark} openly. [Authoritarians will not]{.mark}. For this
reason, among many others, authoritarians must not triumph.]{.underline}

The good news is that [given the behavior of China and Russia, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [[allies are ready to
contribute]{.mark} to the common defense. Many countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, including [Australia]{.mark}, the
[Philippines]{.mark}, and [Japan, recognize the threat a]{.mark}nd
appear committed to addressing it. Relations between Japan and South
Korea are better than ever.]{.underline} [Moscow's recent agreements
with Pyongyang have alarmed Seoul and should deepen its cooperation with
democratic allies. [India]{.mark}, through]{.underline} its membership
in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue---also known as [the
Quad,]{.underline} the strategic partnership that also includes
Australia, Japan, and the United States---[[is cooperating]{.mark}
closely with the U.S. military and emerging as a pivotal power in the
Indo-Pacific. [Vietnam]{.mark}, too, appears willing to
contribute,]{.underline} given its own strategic concerns with China.
The challenge will be to turn the ambitions of U.S. partners into
sustained commitment once the costs of enhanced defense capabilities
become clear.

[In Europe, the war in [Ukraine]{.mark} has [mobilized NATO]{.mark} in
ways unimaginable a few years ago. The addition of [Sweden and
Finland]{.mark} to NATO's Arctic flank brings real military capability
and [helps secure the Baltic states. ]{.mark}]{.underline}The question
of postwar security arrangements for Ukraine hangs over the continent at
this moment. The most straightforward answer would be to admit Ukraine
to NATO and simultaneously to the European Union. Both institutions have
accession processes that would take some time. [The key point is this:
[Moscow needs to know]{.mark} that the [alliance does not intend to
leave a vacuum]{.mark} in Europ]{.underline}e.

The United States also needs a strategy for dealing with the nonaligned
states of the global South. These countries will insist on strategic
flexibility, and Washington should resist the urge to issue loyalty
tests. Rather, it should develop policies that address their concerns.
Above all, the United States needs a meaningful alternative to the Belt
and Road Initiative, China's massive global infrastructure program. The
[[BRI is]{.underline}]{.mark} often depicted as helping China win hearts
and minds, but in reality it is [[not winning anything.]{.mark}
Recipients are growing frustrated with the [corruption]{.mark}, [poor
safety and labor]{.mark} standards, and [fiscal unsustainability]{.mark}
associated with its projects. The aid that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Europe, Japan, and others offer is small by
comparison, but unlike Chinese aid, it can attract significant foreign
direct investment from the private sector, thus dwarfing the amount
provided by the BRI.]{.underline} But you can't beat something with
nothing. A U.S. strategy that shows no interest in a region until China
shows up is not going to succeed. [[Washington needs]{.mark} to
demonstrate sustained [engagement]{.mark} with countries [in]{.mark} the
global South on the issues they care about---namely, [economic
development, security]{.mark}, and [climate]{.mark} change.]{.underline}

WHICH WAY, AMERICA?

The pre--World War II era was defined not only by great-power conflict
and a weak international order but also by a rising tide of populism and
isolationism. So is the current era. The main question hanging over the
international system today is, Where does America stand?

The biggest difference between the first half of the twentieth century
and the second half was the fact of Washington's sustained and
purposeful global engagement. After World War II, the United States was
a confident country, with a baby boom, a growing middle class, and
unbridled optimism about the future. The struggle against communism
provided bipartisan unity, even if there were sometimes disagreements
over specific policies. Most agreed with President John F. Kennedy that
their country was willing to "pay any price, bear any burden" in the
defense of freedom.

The United States is a different country now---exhausted by eight
decades of international leadership, some of it successful and
appreciated, and some of it dismissed as failure. The American people
are different, too---less confident in their institutions and in the
viability of the American dream. Years of divisive rhetoric, Internet
echo chambers, and, even among the best-educated youth, ignorance of the
complexity of history have left Americans with a tattered sense of
shared values. For the latter problem, elite cultural institutions bear
much of the blame. They have rewarded those who tear down the United
States and ridiculed those who extol its virtues. To address Americans'
lack of faith in their institutions and in one another, schools and
colleges must change their curricula to offer a more balanced view of
U.S. history. And instead of creating a climate that reinforces one's
existing opinions, these and other institutions should encourage a
healthy debate in which competing ideas are encouraged.

That said, great-power DNA is still very much in the American genome.
Americans carry two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. One side of
the brain looks at the world and thinks that the United States has done
enough, saying, "It is someone else's turn." The other side looks abroad
and sees a large country trying to extinguish a smaller one, children
choking on nerve gas, or a terrorist group beheading a journalist and
says, "We must act." The president can appeal to either side.

The new Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse---[[populism, nativism,
isolationism, and protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}---tend to ride
together, and they [[are challenging the]{.mark} political [center. Only
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can
counter their advance]{.underline}]{.mark} and resist the temptation to
go back to the future. [But generating support for an internationalist
foreign policy requires a president to paint a vivid picture of what
that world would be like [without an active U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. In such a world, [an emboldened [Putin
and Xi,]{.mark} having defeated Ukraine, would [move on to]{.mark} their
[next conquest. Iran would celebrate]{.mark} the United States'
withdrawal from the Middle East and sustain its illegitimate regime
[by]{.mark} external [conquest]{.mark} through its proxies]{.underline}.
[[Hamas]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Hezbollah]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
hopes that Gulf Arab states would normalize relations with Israel would
be dashed. [The international [economy]{.mark} would be
[weaker]{.mark}]{.underline}, sapping U.S. growth. [[International
waters would be contested]{.underline}]{.mark}, with piracy and other
incidents at sea stalling the movement of goods. American leaders should
remind the public that a reluctant United States has repeatedly been
drawn into conflict---in 1917, 1941, and 2001. Isolation has never been
the answer to the country's security or prosperity.

Then, a leader must say that the United States is well positioned to
design a different future. The country's endlessly creative private
sector is capable of continuous innovation. The United States has an
unparalleled and secure energy bounty from Canada to Mexico that can
sustain it through a reasonable energy transition over the many years it
will take. It has more allies than any great power in history and good
friends, as well. People around the world seeking a better life still
dream of becoming Americans. If the United States can summon the will to
deal with its immigration puzzle, it will not suffer the demographic
calamity that faces most of the developed world.

The United States' global involvement will not look exactly as it has
for the last 80 years. Washington is likely to choose its engagements
more carefully. If deterrence is strong, that may be enough. Allies will
have to bear more of the cost of defending themselves. Trade agreements
will be less ambitious and global but more regional and selective.

Internationalists must admit that they had a blind spot for those
Americans, such as the unemployed coal miner and steelworker, who lost
out as good jobs fled abroad. And the forgotten did not take kindly to
the argument that they should shut up and be happy with cheap Chinese
goods. This time, there can be no more platitudes about the advantages
of globalization for all. There must be a real effort to give people
meaningful education, skills, and job training. The task is even more
urgent since technological progress will severely punish those who
cannot keep up.

Those who argue for engagement will need to reframe what it means. [The
80 years of U.S. internationalism is another analogy that doesn't
perfectly fit the circumstances of today. Still, if the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries taught Americans anything, it is this: [other
great powers]{.mark} don't mind their own business. Instead, they [seek
to shape the global order.]{.mark} The [future will be]{.mark}
determined by the [alliance of democratic]{.mark}, free-market [states
or]{.mark} it will be determined by the [revisionist
powers,]{.mark}]{.underline} [harking back to a day of territorial
[conquest]{.mark} abroad [and authoritarian practices]{.mark} at home.
There is simply no other option.]{.underline}

​The [stability of the international system has long been closely related
to the stability of the key regions of Eurasia: [Europe]{.mark}, the
[Middle East]{.mark} and [East Asia. War]{.mark} or the threat of war
[pervades all three]{.mark} areas at once.]{.underline}

This makes a final feature of our era more sobering: a [still
powerful,]{.underline} but less reliable, [[America]{.mark}. US
[advantages]{.mark}, economic and military, remain [substantial]{.mark},
and American [commitment]{.mark} remains [indispensable]{.mark} to a
decent world]{.underline}. Unfortunately, at a time when many Western
countries face political paralysis, instability, or some mixture of the
two, America's own internal dramas could be uniquely damaging.

Yes, the near-term danger is a second Trump presidency that could weaken
US alliances and spur frontline states like Poland or South Korea to
build their own nuclear weapons --- or, alternatively, a second Biden
presidency in which America is led by a visibly declining
commander-in-chief. But the problems run deeper.

Lurking behind Trump is a larger America First movement that would just
as soon leave the world to itself. Lurking behind Biden is a potentially
potent form of progressive neo-isolationism. The political foundations
of American internationalism are thus unstable. Rising polarization and
domestic tensions could leave the US distracted, even consumed by its
inner demons --- just as surging global volatility makes the price of
that distraction higher.

World War III?

Eras of turmoil can bring happy endings. The Cold War birthed the
liberal international order, which eventually delivered more freedom,
peace and prosperity than humanity had ever enjoyed before. Today,
realism need not be synonymous with despondency, because [the [US
and]{.mark} its democratic [allies]{.mark} still [have]{.mark}
**[long-term advantages]{.mark}** over their foes, including their free
governmental institutions.]{.underline} But for political leaders and
business leaders, navigating this age of fragmentation will require
keeping some core principles in mind.

First, [there is no return to "normal." Today's [crises in
Ukraine]{.mark}, the [Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} and other
[hotspots]{.mark}]{.underline} aren't freak occurrences. They are
[[symptoms of]{.mark} deep, ongoing [shifts]{.mark} that are changing
the basic rhythms of global affairs.]{.underline}

Particular crises may come and go; particular tensions may rise or fall.
But leaders in government and business must prepare for an era of
persistent vitality, competition and conflict. [[Levels of risk]{.mark},
both strategic and economic, will be [elevated]{.mark} for years to
come.]{.underline}

Second, you can't have it all. After the Cold War, the US and its allies
could enjoy a world that was phenomenally congenial to their interests
and values at a very low price. Multinationals could exploit the
efficiencies globalization offered without worrying too much about the
vicissitudes of global politics. Neither approach is sustainable today.

As the leaders who attended this month's NATO summit can attest, the
cost of national security, and of safeguarding democratic values, is
rising as autocratic powers make their moves. Meanwhile, Western
companies that had to choose whether to stay in Russia after it invaded
Ukraine --- or are wondering how to protect their assets, operations and
reputations if China invades Taiwan --- are discovering that the
dilemmas of operating in a hothouse environment can be severe.

Third, [**[take worst-case]{.mark}** scenarios
**[seriously]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Responsible American officials
need to [consider]{.mark} not just the possibility of a [US-Russia clash
or]{.mark} a [US-China conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} --- as cataclysmic
as either would be --- [but also a **[global war,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in which [conflicts in multiple theaters erupt at once.]{.underline}
International corporations also need to grapple with scenarios that
would have seemed outlandish not so long ago.

[What if the security of vital sea lanes suffers because the Houthis
have set a precedent that others follow? How might their operations be
affected by a Sino-American war that causes a decoupling more
violent]{.underline}, precipitous and far-reaching than nearly anyone
envisions today? We can hope these situations won't come to pass. But
grappling with them is how one builds the resilience, whether military
or intellectual, needed to thrive in a tumultuous world.

Fourth, as geopolitics and geoeconomics become inseparable, the West
needs to invest in new knowledge. In government, national security is no
longer so thoroughly dominated by diplomats and defense nerds.
Understanding investment patterns, financial and technological choke
points, and private sector decision-making has become crucial to
prevailing in modern rivalry. The private sector, for its part, is
entering a moment in which geopolitical illiteracy is simply negligent ,
given that few firms are wholly insulated from the disruption --- or
opportunity --- national rivalries can cause.

This relates to a final precept: Find the upside of adversity. Yes, the
world is getting nastier. But an age of [[fracture creates chances
for]{.mark} the [US to build]{.mark} deeper
[connections]{.mark}]{.underline} with like-minded nations in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific, [to [catalyze]{.mark}]{.underline} a historic burst of
[[innovation]{.mark} in critical technologies]{.underline}, and to
[[demonstrate]{.mark} that [liberal societies]{.mark} can still
[outperform]{.mark} illiberal ones.]{.underline}

It creates chances, as well, for firms to craft more resilient supply
chains; to reap the benefits of the new industrial policy; and to forge
stronger partnerships with a US government that desperately needs
private-sector creativity and innovation to master a new set of
economic, intelligence and military challenges.

We're in the opening phase of a brutally contentious era. The task is to
make the most of it.

on]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}** is[,]{.underline} judging by
President Vladimir Putin's threats, [part of a struggle to revise
post-Cold War arrangements, and it **[threatens]{.mark}** to tip into a

Elsewhere, [a]{.underline} [[**wave** of

**[Sudan]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[is adding to a global tally of people
dead, displaced, and hungry due to **fighting**]{.underline} [that is
higher than at any time in decades.]{.underline}

Generalizing about what drives the turmoil is hard, given each
conflict's distinct roots. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to some
degree, [**[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}---[[are]{.underline} **[challenging
orders]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that were **underpinned**]{.underline}
[for decades by U.S. power in Asia and Europe]{.underline}. Elsewhere,
[[absent]{.mark} a **[hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline} or concert of big
powers acting in unity, [more [leaders sense]{.mark} **[constraints
crumbl]{.mark}ing**]{.underline}. [More see opportunities [to
**pursue**]{.mark} ends by **[violent means]{.mark}** or fear losing out
if they hold back.]{.underline}

Most governments, of course, do not seek to crush rivals at home or
sponsor proxies abroad, let alone annex neighbors or kill civilians en
masse. But [more are taking things into their own hands]{.underline}.
Increasingly[, the main check on their actions is how much fight their
foes can put up.]{.underline}

[If]{.underline} **[adventurism]{.underline}** [is on the rise, its
knock-on effects]{.underline}---how rivals sensing the same loosened
fetters might react---[are harder to foresee]{.underline}.
**[Interlinked conflicts]{.underline}** [make]{.underline} **[unintended
consequences]{.underline}** [likelier]{.underline}. Yahya Sinwar, the
Hamas leader who masterminded the Oct. 7 assault, surely underestimated
the ruin that a largely unrestrained Israel would wreak on Gaza in
response.

Even Israel, for all its spycraft, did not predict that its hammering of
Hezbollah in Lebanon would help a reformed al Qaeda offshoot seize
Damascus. (Syria's new ruler, despite his jihadi past, says he's not
looking for a fight with Israel.)

Trump's return brings fresh uncertainty. In Europe, the Asia-Pacific,
and the Middle East, Trump's promises are often contradictory, as are
the views of his cabinet picks and loyalists. If he doubles down on
confrontation, how much risk will he tolerate? If he seeks deals, what
trade-offs might they entail, and what might the implications be for
U.S. allies? Outside those arenas, if Washington is largely absent, how
will others fill the space?

Trump's admirers see virtue in impetuousness. [[Keeping rivals and
allies on their toes]{.mark} can **[deter]{.mark}** the former [and
**extract**]{.mark} **[concessions]{.mark}** from the
latter.]{.underline} [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, they say,
[[was]{.underline} **[shyer]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of acting up [with
Trump]{.mark} in office, [and]{.mark} Trump's]{.underline}
**[[ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about NATO has **[shake]{.mark}n
[Europeans]{.mark}** [out of]{.mark} their **[complacency]{.mark}**
about]{.underline} the continent's [security]{.underline} just as much
as the Kremlin's aggression has.

But unpredictability could just as easily backfire. While no one wants
all-out war, [**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} as much [[a]{.underline}
**[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} [along **major-power fault
lines**]{.underline} as elsewhere. If Trump or top officials get too
hawkish, a rival could respond in kind, aiming to reset a red line but
crossing one of Washington's own. Or a U.S. ally---the Philippines, say,
or Taiwan or Israel---could overstep, prompting
[**[retal]{.mark}**iation]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that [[risks]{.underline} **[dragging in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

On the other hand, if Trump disparages Washington's alliances, an
adversary---**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most likely, but
plausibly [**[Pyongyang]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}]{.mark} even
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} decide
to [[test]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump's [[willingness]{.mark} to come to
the aid of U.S. allies]{.underline}, [[prompting]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[political [uproar]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in
Washington [that **forces**]{.mark} the [president]{.mark}'s
hand.]{.underline}

Bellicosity might also engender more united resistance. [[Talk
of]{.mark} a China-Russia-North Korea-Iran "[**axis**" is
**overblown**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[given]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[the four]{.mark} capitals [share]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[few
interests]{.underline}**]{.mark} beyond resisting U.S. power and evading
sanctions. [Still, they increasingly help one another out]{.underline}.
Iranian and North Korean arms; dual-use components from China; and, now,
North Korean troops are helping to sustain Putin's war effort in
Ukraine. The defense pact that Putin inked with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un in November in principle binds Pyongyang, and potentially
peninsular security, to the war in Europe.

Ties among these adversaries will likely tighten if Trump ratchets up
hostility on all fronts---all the more so if he pushes Europe to toughen
trade restrictions on China or encourages NATO to involve itself more in
Asia.

[For dealmaking, Trump's heterodoxy might be]{.underline} more of [an
advantage]{.underline}---if it's aimed in the right direction. The
hypothetical **[[grand bargain]{.underline}]{.mark}** with Chinese
leader Xi Jinping that is floated by some in Trump's orbit---[which
would lead Washington [to accept]{.mark} [Chinese
primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} in Asia, including over Taiwan (the
manufacturer of almost all the advanced microchips that the global
economy relies upon)---[[seems]{.underline}
**[far-fetched]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

A deal with Russia that left Ukraine demilitarized and without security
guarantees, as Putin demands, would quickly collapse. [**[No stable
path]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[s]{.mark}**phere-**[o]{.mark}**f-**[i]{.mark}**nfluence]{.underline}-type

[[reflects]{.underline}]{.mark} a strategic [[focus on

advancements, however, [[China's military also]{.mark}
[faces]{.mark}]{.underline} serious [[obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[It is grappling with]{.underline}

to]{.underline} **[project power]{.underline}** on a global scale, by
contrast, [remains unmatched]{.underline}, supported by extensive combat
experience, a vast alliance network, and forward-deployed forces

yet [[match]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate**[s']{.underline}** greatest force

real-time [coordination]{.underline} that allows the United States to
pre-position forces far from its shores, thus
**[[amplifying]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [military]{.underline}
**[[effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and readiness]{.underline}. A
superpower is a country capable of projecting force and exercising
influence in every corner of the world. The United States meets this
definition. China does not, at least not yet.

The decentralized nature of the United States' **[[democratic
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which significant governance
responsibilities remain vested with state and local authorities,
[[remains]{.mark} an]{.underline} American
[[advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}, too. Unlike in China, the United
States' regular [electoral cycles and peaceful transfers]{.underline} of
power [enable]{.underline} citizens to insist on [change]{.underline}
when they become dissatisfied with the country's trajectory. And
although the United States must urgently address the many threats to its
democratic norms from extreme polarization and institutional erosion, it
still boasts serious checks on presidential power from a free media, an
independent legislature, and a transparent legal system.

FALSE CEILING

It is vital to remember that [Beijing's]{.underline} greatest
[wins]{.underline} have tended to [occur]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [in spite of American efforts, but in
their]{.underline} **[absence]{.underline}**. Take 5G
telecommunications: China developed and deployed next-generation
wireless networks at breakneck speed, cornering markets in Africa, Asia,
and parts of Europe. This did not happen because the United States
lacked the capacity to compete, but because it was slow to invest in
domestic alternatives and unwilling to mobilize resources to scale a
national strategy at China's pace.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} especially **[rapid
[advancements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.underline}
**[quantum]{.underline}**]{.mark} communications [[and]{.underline}
**[satellite]{.underline}**]{.mark} [networks
[underscore]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[extent to which
it]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark}
leadership in **[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
been slower to embrace]{.underline} or fund at scale. This success has
been driven by government subsidies, aggressive industrial policies, and
a singular focus on securing critical raw materials, often at a high
geopolitical and environmental price. These gains come with other costs,
too. The Chinese government's laser focus on specific strategic domains
has diverted its attention and resources from projects that would drive
longer-term economic growth, such as reforming the social safety net and
boosting domestic consumption.

As China struggles, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
[**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates [[should press its
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so, U.S. [policymakers must make
significant investments]{.underline} in areas in which the United States
appears strong, boosting funding for research and development and
cutting-edge industries, attracting global talent through targeted
immigration reform, fortifying alliances in Asia and Europe, and

their hands over China's ascendancy instead of taking these crucial
steps, Washington's strategic advantage could quickly erode.

It is undeniable that the United States faces serious challenges. But it
is equally undeniable that it retains extraordinary strengths---and that
its democratic institutions, albeit stressed, possess a unique capacity
for renewal. **[[Competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the United
States and Beijing [[will be]{.mark} a [defining]{.mark} feature of the
coming decades]{.underline}. But although [China's]{.underline}
centralized governance may deliver rapid advancements in key areas, its
[gains are fragile]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} real
**[peril]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited

rise of a new rival but [in]{.underline} its own
**[unwillingness]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} acknowledge and [build
on its]{.underline} own unmatched [potential]{.underline}.

And [although [China]{.mark} will continue to be]{.underline} a
[powerful]{.underline} and influential global player, [it is
[confronting]{.mark}]{.underline} a growing set of [complex]{.underline}
**[challenges]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} will significantly
[complicate its development]{.underline}. [Following a]{.underline}
**[decade]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [**[slowing growth]{.mark}**,
China's economy now contends with]{.underline} **[mounting
[pressures]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[turbulent]{.underline} **[[real estate]{.underline}]{.mark}** market,
[**[surging debt]{.mark}**, constrained local]{.underline} government
[finances]{.underline}, [waning productivity, and]{.underline} a
**[rapidly [aging]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark}, all of which will require Beijing to
grapple with difficult tradeoffs. Abroad, [China [faces
regional]{.mark}]{.underline} **[military
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing
scrutiny and [[pushback]{.underline}]{.mark} by advanced economies.
Indeed, some of the foundational [conditions that drove
China's]{.underline} remarkable [growth]{.underline} over the past two
decades [are unraveling]{.underline}. But just as these new difficulties
are emerging, demanding nimble policymaking, Chinese leader
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping's [consolidation]{.underline} of power has
[stifled]{.underline} political [debate and sidelined technocrats,
yielding]{.underline} a [policymaking]{.underline} process [that is
brittle, reactive, and prone to]{.underline} **[missteps]{.underline}**.
[Chinese young]{.underline} people now [lament]{.underline} the
narrowing space they have to achieve their goals, a trend that won't
change unless [their country's leadership does]{.underline}. But that
event appears distant.

The United States still has a vital edge over China.

Even with its many shortcomings and vulnerabilities, [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[continues to [command]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[strategic
depth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that China]{.underline} fundamentally
[lacks]{.underline}: a unique combination of **[[economic
vitality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, global **[[military
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [remarkable]{.underline} [**hu[man
capital]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and a political [system]{.mark} designed
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} promote the [[correct]{.underline}ion]{.mark}
of [[errors]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The]{.underline}
**[resilient]{.underline}** and adaptable U.S. [economy has
the]{.underline} world's **[[deepest]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} [most liquid]{.underline} [**[capital
markets]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[unparalleled]{.underline}**
[influence]{.underline}]{.mark} over the global financial system. The
United States [continues to attract]{.underline} **[top]{.underline}**
global **[talent]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline} many [Chinese
nationals]{.underline} now fleeing their country's autocratic political
environment.

Put plainly, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[still has]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[vital [edge]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over China [in terms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[economic [dynamism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[global]{.underline} **[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To highlight this fact is neither
triumphalism nor complacency. It is the root of good strategy, because
[[Washington can]{.underline}]{.mark} easily [[squander]{.mark}
its]{.underline} asymmetric [[advantages if]{.underline}]{.mark}
excessive **[[pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}** or panic
[[depletes]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, muddies
its focus, or leads it to overindulge nativist and protectionist
impulses and close America's doors to the rest of the world. For despite
its problems, [[China is]{.mark} still [making]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[headway]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [domains
that challenge]{.underline} U.S. national [security]{.underline} and
prosperity, [such as]{.underline} **[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}**
computing, **[renewable [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**lectric
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle [production]{.underline}. A
political-economic system such as [China's can remain a]{.underline}
**[fierce rival]{.underline}** in key areas even as it groans under the
weight of its pathologies.

China most often gains primacy in areas in which the United States is
dramatically underinvested. China's greatest assets in its competition
with the United States are not its underlying fundamentals but its
hyperfocus and willingness to expend enormous resources, and tolerate
enormous waste, in the pursuit of key objectives. That means that
[Washington cannot afford to retreat]{.underline} from sectors vital for
competing in the twenty-first century's economy, as it did in the case
of 5G technology in the previous decade.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric relied
particularly heavily on the specter of American decline.
[The]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [does face]{.underline} its own
daunting array of [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad and at home,
[but these]{.underline} [**[pale]{.underline}** [in comparison
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [those [China]{.mark} faces]{.underline}. And
Washington's tendency to stress its rivals' power and underestimate its
own strengths has often backfired, becoming a trap that leads to serious
policy errors. Even Trump's most pessimistic advisers should understand
this history---and recognize that U.S. leaders risk making costly
missteps by adopting a reactive posture toward China instead of
capitalizing on the United States' comparative advantages to push
forward its interests at a moment when Beijing is struggling.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

CONFIDENCE GAME Throughout the last century, the United States has
consistently overestimated the strength of its rivals and underestimated
its own. This habit became particularly evident during the Cold War,
when U.S. officials and analysts were consumed by fears that the Soviet
Union had grown superior in military might, technological advancement,
and global political influence. In the late 1950s, for instance, U.S.
officials came to believe that the Soviets had a much larger and more
sophisticated stockpile of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Intelligence gathered by U-2 spy planes and other sources, however,
later revealed that the so-called missile gap had been mostly imaginary.
As the Cold War drew to a close, it became clear that the Soviet economy
was crumbling under the weight of military expenditures, and much of the
feared Soviet superiority was exaggerated or based on
misinterpretations. The tendency to underappreciate the United States'
strength is driven by a difference in how democracies and autocracies
perceive and present their weaknesses. Democratic systems are more
transparent and foster more debate about their own flaws. This can lead
to a heightened focus on domestic shortcomings, making weaknesses appear
more significant than they are. A democracy's vulnerabilities can seem
even more alarming when compared with the apparent strength of
authoritarian regimes, which, conversely, punish criticism and
disseminate propaganda in order to present a brighter picture than the
reality. The Soviet Union strove to maintain a veneer of invincibility
by censoring its press and mounting military parades. Its efforts to
mask its economic stagnation, political infighting, and failure to
innovate often fooled U.S. policymakers; the United States' tendency
toward self-criticism, meanwhile, obscured its own advantages.
Sometimes, this dynamic redounds to the United States' benefit. The
prospect of a rival's ascendancy can mobilize American resources and
political will: for instance, although the claim that the United States
lagged the Soviet Union in its production of ballistic missiles was
largely erroneous, the warning served as a powerful motivator for the
U.S. government to boost its defense spending and accelerate its
technological research. To some extent, the misperception that the
United States was losing its comparative advantage helped it maintain
that advantage. Similarly, the Soviet Union's early space-race
victories---and the fear that the United States would fall behind in a
crucial, symbolic contest---prompted the U.S. government to create NASA,
renew its investments in science education in American schools, and
increase funding for scientific research. In this case, the worry that
the Soviet Union was outstripping the United States was valuable,
catalyzing beneficial investments that undergirded a subsequent half
century of American technological superiority. Underestimating
geopolitical threats also comes with costs, as it did in the case of
Nazi Germany's rise in the 1930s, al Qaeda's growth in the 1990s, and
Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The chaos
that these underestimates unleashed can make it seem as if it is
generally safer to overestimate the threat posed by a potential
adversary. But in many cases, developing an outsize fear of a rival has
led the United States to misallocate government resources, lose sight of
the need to nurture its own sources of strength, become distracted by
peripheral threats, or even become mired in unnecessary wars. The United
States' immense financial and human investments in the Vietnam War, for
example, were inspired in part by the so-called domino theory, which
held that if the United States allowed Soviet-backed communism to take
hold in Southeast Asia, communism would inexorably come to dominate the
globe. That belief led the United States to fixate on winning a costly,
protracted war that ultimately drained its resources, hurt its
reputation worldwide, and eroded Americans' trust in their own
government. Decades later, a similar mobilization against an exaggerated
threat---Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq---led to a disastrous and
drawn-out conflict, domestic turmoil, and the further decline of the
United States' international credibility. The United States' tendency to
point to a rival's strength to spur domestic action has thus been a
double-edged sword. On the one hand, perceived threats can mobilize
resources, drive innovation, and foster unity in the face of potential
challenges, as seen with the space race and military advancements during
the Cold War. A useful overestimate is one that galvanizes constructive
action without leading to paranoia or unsustainable commitments.
Overestimates become damaging when they dramatically skew government
priorities and distract leaders' finite attention from other pressing
issues. Recognizing the difference requires both a nuanced understanding
of a rival's capabilities and the development of a well-calibrated and
sustainable response to them.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

ALL THAT GLITTERS

Today, [many]{.underline} in the United States [fear]{.underline} that
[China will]{.underline} **[eclipse]{.underline}** [its
power]{.underline}. On the surface, evidence for this prediction is
abundant. [In]{.underline} a variety of **[key]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}, [from]{.underline} **[hypersonic
missiles]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[shipbuilding]{.underline}**,
[China is increasingly powerful]{.underline}, if not dominant, which
appears to demonstrate that China's state-driven political-economic
model remains more than capable of "concentrating power to do big
things," as Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping put it.

[Yet the foundations of [China's]{.mark} strength are
[strained]{.mark}]{.underline} by mounting challenges. The country's
[growth rate]{.underline} has [steadily]{.underline}
**[declined]{.underline}** from its 2007 peak; the [past five
years]{.underline}, in particular, have [ushered in]{.underline} stark
**[[structural problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
economic **[volatility]{.underline}**. The [real estate]{.underline}
market, a core driver of China's growth and urban development, [is
[experiencing]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[historic
correction]{.underline}]{.mark}** with far-reaching implications. In
August 2024, the International Monetary Fund estimated that roughly
**[50 percent]{.underline}** [of Chinese [property developers]{.mark}
are [on]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[brink]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[insolvency]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Their woes are
[driven]{.underline} in part [by]{.underline} a [persistent decline in
housing prices]{.underline}, which as of October 2024, were [falling at
their]{.underline} **[fastest pace]{.underline}** since 2015. Because
[more than 70 percent of]{.underline} Chinese [household wealth is tied
up in]{.underline} the [property]{.underline} market, steep drops in the
value of housing hurt not only developers but nearly all Chinese
citizens.

The real estate [crisis is affecting]{.underline} the finances of
China's [local governments]{.underline}, too. These municipalities were
long reliant on land sales to fund investment in public services and
infrastructure. As property values and land sales falter, these
[[municipalities]{.mark} are becoming]{.underline}
[**[strapped]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[revenue]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [preventing them from
servicing]{.underline} their **[debt]{.underline}** [and
providing]{.underline} essential [services]{.underline}. In an April
2024 analysis, Bloomberg estimated that China's [local
governments]{.underline} had, that month, [generated]{.underline} their
**[lowest revenue]{.underline}** from land sales [in]{.underline} eight
[years]{.underline}. To compensate, [they]{.underline} have [resorted
to]{.underline} collecting **[arbitrary fines]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} local [companies]{.underline}, clawing back bonuses
paid to local officials, [and]{.underline} even seeking
[loans]{.underline} from private firms to cover payroll.

Even [Chinese [citizens' faith]{.mark}]{.underline} in Beijing's
economic stewardship [[is]{.underline}
**[eroding]{.underline}**]{.mark}. According to The Wall Street Journal,
as much as **[\$254 billion]{.underline}** may have quietly [flowed out
of the country]{.underline} between June 2023 and June 2024---[a clear
signal of domestic]{.underline} **[disillusionment]{.underline}**.
[Young people are turning to]{.underline} a posture they call "lying
flat," a [quiet rebellion]{.underline} against societal expectations
that demand relentless effort in exchange for increasingly elusive
rewards. [With youth unemployment surging]{.underline} to record levels,
[young Chinese]{.underline} people [face a bleak reality]{.underline}:
advanced degrees and grueling work no longer guarantee stable employment
or upward mobility.

The external environment that formerly supported China's meteoric rise
is also characterized by wariness. [Foreign
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline} that once rushed to tap the potential of
China's vast market [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[approaching]{.underline} it [with caution]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} some are even [[seeking]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[exits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**oreign
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**irect **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nvestment
into China **[[plunged]{.mark} 80 percent]{.underline}** between 2021
and 2023, [reaching [its]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[lowest]{.underline}**
[level]{.underline}]{.mark} in 30 years. Beijing's 2021 [[crackdown
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark} sector [**[wiped
out]{.underline}** [billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars in value,
[and]{.underline} the country's **[[unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[regulatory]{.underline} and political
[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[forced]{.underline}]{.mark}
multinational [[corporations to rethink]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[China]{.underline} strategies. In September, a survey by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai revealed a grim outlook: [fewer than
half of foreign firms expressed optimism]{.underline} about China's
five-year business prospects---the lowest levels of confidence in the
survey's 25-year history.

In the years following its accession into the World Trade Organization,
China was warmly welcomed into global markets, with countries eager to
benefit from its manufacturing prowess and seemingly limitless appetite
for foreign investment. China remains deeply reliant on access to the
world's markets, but many foreign [governments are growing]{.underline}
ever more [concerned about]{.underline} the strategic implications of
[China's]{.underline} economic [reach]{.underline} and military might.
Many [developing countries that]{.underline} initially
[embraced]{.underline} its **[B]{.underline}**elt and
**[R]{.underline}**oad **[I]{.underline}**nitiative as a pathway to
infrastructure development, for example, [are scrutinizing the project's
impact]{.underline}, worried about its negative effects on the
environment and on local labor practices. [Advanced
economies]{.underline} such as Australia and Canada have
[erected]{.underline} new [investment screening]{.underline} mechanisms
to better protect their economies from national security risks stemming
from Chinese investment. In March 2019, in a "strategic outlook" report,
the [Europe]{.underline}an Commission formally [labeled China a
"systemic rival,"]{.underline} marking a shift from the traditional view
that the country offered a market opportunity with few downsides. The EU
subsequently [moved to impose]{.underline} [stricter
reg]{.underline}ulation[s]{.underline} on Chinese investments in
Europe's critical infrastructure, technology, and digital sectors [and
tariffs]{.underline} of up to 45 percent on Chinese-made electric
vehicles.

Washington's tendency to focus on its rivals' strength has often
backfired.

[Xi]{.underline}, meanwhile, has [ushered]{.underline} in a governance
style characterized by [reactive]{.underline}, opaque
[decision-making]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} often
[exacerbates]{.underline} China's domestic and international
[tensions]{.underline}. By consolidating his authority within a small
circle of loyalists, [Xi]{.underline} has [weakened]{.underline} the
internal [checks and balances that]{.underline} might otherwise [temper
policy]{.underline} decisions. Beijing's [handling of]{.underline} the
initial [COVID]{.underline}-19 outbreak is a striking example: the
suppression of critical information, along with the silencing of
whistleblowers, caused delays in the global response to the virus,
contributing to its rapid spread beyond China's borders. What might have
been a well-coordinated local response metastasized into a global health
crisis, [exposing China to international condemnation]{.underline} and
illustrating the pitfalls of a system that punishes dissent and cuts off
sources of feedback.

Xi's attempts to reduce economic inequality and curb the excesses of
China's booming private sector have followed a similarly opaque and
erratic course. Policy missteps by the central government---such as its
[reluctance to bail out]{.underline} local [governments and rein
in]{.underline} [shadow banking]{.underline} and capital markets---have
[intensified]{.underline} the **[[fiscal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}**
on the Chinese economy, [[triggering]{.underline} **[liquidity
crises]{.underline}**]{.mark} for giant real estate developers. Sudden
and [[aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} regulatory
[[crackdowns]{.underline}]{.mark} in sectors such as technology and
private education have [sent]{.underline} **[shock waves]{.underline}**
through China's business community [and]{.underline}
[[unsettled]{.underline}]{.mark} international
[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark}. With his push to institutionalize what
he calls a "holistic national security concept"---in which Beijing's
economic and political decision-making is guided by concerns about
regime security---[Xi]{.underline} has [[begun to]{.mark}
erode]{.underline} [the]{.mark} very [sources of
[dynamism]{.mark}]{.underline} that propelled China's rapid ascent.
Since Deng began to open China's economy in the late 1970s, Chinese
leaders have striven to offer the country pragmatic, pro-market policies
and to afford local politicians the flexibility to address their areas'
specific challenges. But [hamstrung]{.underline}, now, [by]{.underline}
rigid and [top-down directives]{.underline} that prioritize ideological
conformity over practical solutions, local [politicians are ill equipped
to tackle]{.underline} the mounting pressures of [fiscal **insolvency**
and]{.underline} **[unemployment]{.underline}**.

[Entrepreneurs]{.underline}, once key engines of China's economic
miracle, now [operate in a climate of]{.underline}
**[fear]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[uncertainty]{.underline}**,
unsure of what Beijing's next policy shift might be. The [lack of
transparency]{.underline} or legal recourse in government
decision-making [reveals]{.underline} the deeper [flaws]{.underline} of
centralized governance: [policies are developed]{.underline} and carried
out [with little]{.underline} consultation or [explanation]{.underline},
leaving citizens and businesses to navigate the fallout. Xi's
consolidation of power may offer short-term control and a capacity to
achieve certain strategic and technological outcomes through brute
force. But it [risks rendering China's policymaking]{.underline}
apparatus increasingly tone-deaf, [out of touch]{.underline} with both
domestic realities and global expectations.

GOOD BONES

The extreme [attitudes]{.underline} of either fatalism or triumphalism
can easily [obscure a]{.underline} more [nuanced perspective that
recognizes China's expanding]{.underline} global [influence while
appreciating the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' unique and
**[[enduring]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategic
**[[advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [its]{.underline} [**[resilient
economy]{.underline}**, [innovative]{.underline}]{.mark}
[capacity,]{.underline} **[robust [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
[and]{.underline} **[open]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[society]{.underline}**. In dollar-adjusted terms, [the U.S. [economy
remains]{.mark}]{.underline} not only **[[larger]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[than China's but also]{.underline} larger [than the next three biggest
economies combined]{.underline}, and [it is [on track
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[grow faster]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than any
other G-7 economy]{.underline} in 2024 and 2025, according to
International Monetary Fund estimates. During President Joe Biden's
tenure, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [more than]{.underline}
**[[doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}** [its]{.underline} [**[GDP
lead]{.underline}**]{.mark} [over China]{.underline}, and its share of
global GDP remains near the level it was in the 1990s. Analysts such as
the Rhodium Group's Logan Wright have predicted that [China's share of
global GDP peaked]{.underline} in 2021 [and will]{.underline} likely
[remain below]{.underline} that of [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates for the foreseeable
future. Even observers who think the outlook for China's economy is less
dire agree that [its growth is]{.underline} **[slowing]{.underline}**
[and will be]{.underline} **[constrained]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
structural **[challenges]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} a [clumsy
policy]{.underline}making process.

[[America]{.mark}n companies]{.underline}
**[[dominate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [global
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline}: as of March 2024, [nine of the world's
ten largest firms]{.underline} by market capitalization [were
American]{.underline}; [China's largest firm]{.underline}, Tencent,
[ranked twenty-sixth]{.underline}. And [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continues to
[attract]{.mark} the [most]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[foreign
capital]{.underline}**]{.mark} of any economy, [in]{.underline} stark
[contrast to China's]{.underline} increasing capital
**[outflows]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates also [has more high-skilled]{.underline}
immigrants than any other country; [China]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[struggles to attract]{.underline} any significant amount of
foreign-born [talent]{.underline}.

As the artificial intelligence revolution accelerates, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [well positioned to become
the]{.underline} global [[epicenter of]{.underline}
**[AI]{.underline}**]{.mark} innovation and diffusion. According to
Stanford University's Global AI Power Rankings, the United States leads
the world in artificial intelligence, [possessing]{.underline} a
substantial [[lead]{.mark} over China in]{.underline} areas such as AI
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, private-sector
**[funding]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline}
**[cutting-edge]{.underline}** [AI tech]{.underline}nologies. Over the
past decade, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' tech
sector has consistently outpaced China's in AI, [creating more than
three times as many AI]{.underline}-focused [companies]{.underline}. In
2023, [U.S. companies developed 61 significant]{.underline} AI
[models]{.underline} [compared with China's 15,]{.underline} reflecting
the strength of the United States' AI ecosystem. That same year, [U.S.
[investors poured]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly [**[nine
times]{.underline}** [more capital]{.underline}]{.mark} into AI than
China did, [funding]{.underline} the launch of [897]{.underline} AI
[startups]{.underline}, far [surpassing China's 122]{.underline}. This
[success stems]{.underline} in no small part [from a]{.underline}
decentralized, **[market-driven]{.underline}** [approach]{.underline}
[that China]{.underline}, as it is currently governed, [cannot
emulate]{.underline}. The United States' relatively flexible regulatory
framework, the free collaboration it permits between private companies
and academia, and its ability to attract talent give it an edge.

As the world's largest oil importer, China relies on imports for over 70
percent of its oil needs, leaving it vulnerable to global disruptions.
Geopolitical tensions, supply-chain bottlenecks, or regional conflicts
could severely jeopardize China's energy security. The United States, by
contrast, has nearly achieved energy independence and has emerged as a
leading global producer of oil and natural gas. Its energy dominance is
driven in part by strong innovation in areas such as advanced fracking
and horizontal drilling, and the United States uses its preeminence to
shape global energy markets and strengthen its geopolitical leverage.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted Europe's energy supply, for
example, the United States quickly increased its exports of liquefied
natural gas, reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy.

[The [dollar's status]{.mark}]{.underline} as the world's primary
reserve and settlement currency [[gives]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[unparalleled]{.underline} **[[financial
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although it also has downsides. In

[outpacing]{.mark} the]{.underline} euro (around 20 percent) and the
[[yuan]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[less than]{.underline}** [three

**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [advantages such as
lower borrowing costs]{.underline}, greater [flexibility in
managing]{.underline} its [debt, and]{.underline} the [ability
to]{.underline} impose [sanction]{.underline}s. At the same time, the
dollar's global status imposes costs on the U.S. economy, such as a
persistent trade deficit and pressure on manufacturing when it makes
American exports less competitive. But these are problems Beijing wishes
it had: it is actively promoting alternatives to the dollar and has
unveiled a digital currency to try to blunt the United States' ability
to weaponize its financial system.

[2024 was]{.underline} **[disastrous]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
Chinese President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping. For all of his
rhetoric about "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," [his
regime [faced]{.mark}]{.underline} **[staggering
[setbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Military purges]{.underline} intended
to root out corruption instead [[revealed]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[systemic [turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.mark} continues to
[undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[readiness]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[cratered]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as [unemployment,
bankruptcies]{.mark}, and capital [outflows]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[soared]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, [key
[partners]{.mark}]{.underline} in Moscow and Damascus [[stumbled]{.mark}
or fell]{.underline}, **[undermining]{.underline}** [Beijing's
geostrategic]{.underline} **[ambitions]{.underline}**. Together, [these
and other]{.underline} **[crises]{.underline}** [have revealed a China
that looks increasingly]{.underline} **[fragile]{.underline}**, not
formidable.

If 2024 shattered illusions of China's unyielding ascent,
[**[2025]{.underline}** [promises to]{.underline} **[lay
bare]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that Xi can no longer
conceal]{.underline}.

Facing mounting problems at home and soon an emboldened U.S. President
Donald Trump in Washington, Xi is nevertheless not banking on dramatic
shifts or bold reforms. Instead, he is pursuing a policy of
perseverance: muddling through economic stagnation, avoiding outright
confrontation with Washington, doubling down on ideological discipline,
and fomenting chaos abroad to distract adversaries and buy time to
stabilize his precarious position.

Yet [Xi's approach carries significant risk]{.underline}. While his
[willingness to endure]{.underline} hardship may fortify his grip on
power today, it [threatens to]{.underline} **[unravel]{.underline}**
[his aspirations for China's]{.underline} national [revival]{.underline}
tomorrow.

Contrary to Xi's carefully constructed image of competence, [China's
domestic dilemmas remain profound. A **[shrinking]{.mark}
[population]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[[weakening
currency]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**dwindling**]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
**[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [[exposed cracks]{.mark} in
Xi's economic stewardship]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also
[undermine the]{.underline} Communist [Party's bargain]{.underline} with
the Chinese people: [prosperity in exchange for compliance.]{.underline}
[China's [crisis]{.mark} of confidence risks
**[spiraling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [into a **vicious
cycle**]{.underline} [as weak growth deters investment, shrinks
spending, [deepens **deflation**]{.mark}, and raises
**[unemployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[all of which **[drag
growth]{.mark}** even lower.]{.underline} Xi's reliance on meager
supply-side [stimulus]{.underline} has [delivered fleeting sugar
highs]{.underline}, with modest spending upticks and short-lived credit
expansions. [But]{.underline} **[[ballooning]{.mark}
[debt]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [bad real estate bets, and a stock market
that has been flat]{.underline} for a decade
[[leave]{.underline}]{.mark} Xi with [[few leve]{.mark}rs to reignite
growth]{.underline}.

Worse still, [Xi's campaign to root out]{.underline} perceived
[weaknesses]{.underline} within the party, military, and private sector
has [compounded his conundrum]{.underline}. **[Purges]{.underline}** [of
senior officials]{.underline} such as People's Liberation Army Navy Adm.
Miao Hua---a key enforcer of Xi's ideological conformity accused of
"serious violations of discipline"---as well as former Defense Minister
Li Shangfu [underscore]{.underline} **[rot]{.underline}** [within the
ranks]{.underline}. The reported [detention of]{.underline} more than 80
[business executives]{.underline} in 2024 alone has
[stifled]{.underline} [innovation]{.underline} and fueled fears of
arbitrary state intervention. While [these actions]{.underline} may
consolidate loyalty and enforce control, they also [deepen distrust and
erode]{.underline} the [competence]{.underline} that Xi needs to
navigate mounting pressures.

These widening woes have only steeled [Xi]{.underline}'s resolve. He
routinely [invokes Western]{.underline} "encirclement" and
"[containment]{.underline}," blaming the United States for thwarting
China's rise. But he uses this narrative [to justify ever-expanding
**repression**]{.underline} at home, including
[constructing]{.underline} more than 200 party-run, extrajudicial
[detention facilities to enforce discipline and root out
dissent]{.underline}. In Xi's view, China's domestic struggles
ultimately stem from weak ideological discipline and insufficient
loyalty to his vision. Put differently, in Xi's mind, China isn't
broken; it's disobedient. His solution? A stronger dose of the same
medicine: [tighter party control]{.underline}, [intensified
repression]{.underline}, [and an unrelenting drive to cement his
legacy]{.underline} as the architect of China's historical destiny.

Amid internal challenges, [[Xi is turning to **chaos**]{.mark} abroad
[to **reshape** the **international order**]{.mark} in China's
favor]{.underline}. By [[offering]{.underline}]{.mark} diplomatic cover
and economic [[support for Russia's war]{.mark} in Ukraine]{.underline}
and tacit [[backing]{.mark} for Middle Eastern [disruptors]{.mark} [such
as Iran]{.mark}, Xi is [**fueling crises**]{.mark} that distract,
divide, and drain Western resources.]{.underline} [For Xi, [chaos
is]{.mark}]{.underline} not merely a tactic; it's a form of
[[strategic]{.mark} currency,]{.underline}
[**[undermining]{.underline}** [Western
**cohesion**]{.underline}]{.mark} [while **bolstering**]{.underline} his
narrative of [Chinese]{.underline} resilience and
[strength]{.underline}. [His calculation is stark: [If
**China's**]{.mark} **ascent** is **[faltering]{.mark}**, the
**[international architecture]{.mark}** sustaining its rivals [must
**falter**,]{.mark} too. Seen in this light, [**disorder abroad** is
Xi's **lifeline**]{.mark}---a **calculated gambit** to obscure his
inability to deliver progress at home or globally]{.underline}.

[Yet 2025 will test Xi like never before]{.underline}. Intensifying
scrutiny from Washington---including new semiconductor investigations,
advanced technology export controls, and expanded tariffs---is set to
collide with rising domestic unrest, including labor strikes and online
dissent. At the same time, an emerging anti-authoritarian
alignment---marked by enhanced trans-Atlantic coordination on China and
the new U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral framework---will intensify the
strain. These [converging forces will challenge Xi]{.underline} in ways
he can neither control nor predict, [exposing]{.underline} the
[fragility]{.underline} of his centralized power and [testing the
limits]{.underline} of his carefully constructed narrative of
inevitability.

Xi's biggest X factor will be Trump, whose return promises
unpredictability. In his first term, Trump waited 15 months to impose
tariffs on Chinese goods. This time, tariffs are expected to hit
immediately and intensely, targeting the very lifeblood of China's
faltering economy: exports. These tariffs won't just come faster;
they'll cut deeper, with proposed rates reaching as high as 60 percent
on critical sectors such as technology, consumer goods, and industrial
equipment. Unlike sanctions, which Xi has worked to mitigate and take
years to fully materialize, tariffs take effect overnight, leaving
Beijing with little time to react and forcing Chinese manufacturers to
absorb crushing losses.

Trump's tariff threats translate into tremendous peril for Xi. China's
reliance on the United States---its largest trading partner---sustains
millions of manufacturing jobs, but a rapid tariff escalation could
devastate small and medium enterprises, triggering factory closures and
layoffs. Vulnerable sectors such as electronics and textiles could face
severe disruption, and even the electric vehicle industry---one of
China's few bright spots---is grappling with domestic oversaturation and
budding Western trade barriers. Meanwhile, bipartisan support in
Washington for outbound investment screening threatens to choke off
critical U.S. capital flows, stalling Beijing's technological ambitions
and broader economic goals.

All told, these measures could deliver a knockout blow to China's
economy, which is almost certainly growing below Beijing's official
target of 5 percent. Tellingly, the party has threatened to fire
economists if they warn of economic freefall or express "inappropriate"
views---a hallmark authoritarian move to suppress inconvenient truths.
Xi has made boosting domestic consumption his top priority for 2025, but
this rests on shaky ground, too. If Xi trusts anything even less than
markets, it's the Chinese masses, who have shown no appetite to spend
their way out of his economic quagmire. Investors share this skepticism:
China's 10-year bond yield has plunged to record lows, signaling doubts
about the country's trajectory.

Meanwhile, Xi's reliance on global chaos to sustain his position reveals
a glaring paradox: The instability he is fueling in order to distract
the West could backfire if and when those crises stabilize. In 2025, the
winding down of major conflicts---whether through Trump's promised
dealmaking over Ukraine or Israeli action against Iran's last remaining
proxies---could put the global spotlight back on China. For Xi, this is
a nightmare scenario. The West's fragmented focus has helped mask his
vulnerabilities, but [resolving]{.underline} these [crises could empower
the West to confront him head-on.]{.underline}

[[Xi's choice is]{.mark} stark: hunker down by
[embracing]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**
strategy [[or risk]{.mark} further [instability by
**overreaching**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both paths will test his capacity
for long-term endurance. Confronted by Trump's aggressive posturing, Xi
is unlikely to pursue outright economic warfare, at least initially,
because he recognizes that an escalation would hurt China more than its
adversaries. Instead, Xi may adopt calibrated, symbolic responses---like
the recently announced rare-earth restrictions---to project strength
while preserving room for negotiations. Xi may also leverage retaliatory
tariffs or regulatory crackdowns on U.S. firms operating in China to
signal defiance without provoking a full-scale confrontation.

Domestically, Xi's task is how to redefine success. If political
stability and ideological discipline now take primacy over economic
growth, Xi will have to reframe hardship as proof positive of China's
resilience and moral superiority over the West. If national rejuvenation
now takes decades longer than planned, Xi will likely cast the delays as
necessary steps in achieving the "Chinese Dream." Whether the Chinese
people will embrace this new narrative---or tire of a perpetually
deferred future---remains an open question.

On the global stage, [Xi's reliance on instability poses]{.underline}
its own [perils]{.underline}. Rather than treading water, [[Xi
may]{.underline} **[escalate tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark}
elsewhere---perhaps [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, [[testing U.S. resolve through
**confrontation** with]{.mark} the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet as much as [a chaos-driven
strategy]{.underline} intends to distract adversaries and sidestep
direct confrontation, it [[invites]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**]{.mark}ulation. More [specifically, Xi [risks
exposing Beijing to]{.mark} the **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** that have
undermined other authoritarian regimes]{.underline}---from Russian
President Vladimir Putin's disastrous gamble of invading Ukraine to
Hamas's ill-fated Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that invited
overwhelming retaliation.

Of course, the irony of Xi's leadership is that a seemingly
transformational figure obsessed with progress cannot embrace change.
Under his rule, [China has become]{.underline} a power both [disruptive
and constrained]{.underline}, where every effort to tighten control
risks tarnishing Beijing's global standing and undermining the
credibility of its great-power ascent. But muddling through isn't
leading, and for someone whose [**[legitimacy]{.mark}** [hinges on
d]{.mark}elivering **[national prestige]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[mere
**survival**]{.mark} risks [falling]{.mark} dangerously [short of
his]{.mark} own **[lofty ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
whether 2025 becomes a turning point or simply another terrible,
horrible, no good year will depend on Xi's ability to overcome the
greatest challenge of all: himself.

### Pursuit Inevitable

#### Trump pursues heg inevitably.

Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} isn't even president yet, and he's
already giving US foreign policy a 19th century feel. The
president-elect has [spent]{.underline} the [weeks]{.underline} before
his inauguration [[promoting]{.mark} an]{.underline}
**[epic]{.underline}** [agenda of]{.underline} **[[territorial
expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Western Hemisphere ---
[and]{.underline} [threatening]{.underline} to use
[coercion]{.underline}, even force, to make it a reality.

It's a mistake to dismiss this as Trumpian bluster or diplomatic
trolling: [His [taunts]{.mark} are a preview of]{.underline} the new
**[[continentalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is [likely to color his
foreign policy.]{.underline} The smart version of [that]{.underline}
doctrine [could [help the US]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[flourish]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in a fragmenting
environment.]{.underline} The destructive variant could hasten the
demise of the world order Washington has long labored to protect.

Every president says [[foreign policy begins at
home]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Trump]{.underline} may [really mean
it]{.underline}: [His]{.underline} pre-inauguration
[pronouncements]{.underline} have [targeted America's]{.underline}
hemispheric [backyard]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} has
[[threatened]{.underline} **[Mexico]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Canada]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
**[tariffs]{.underline}**]{.mark} [if they don't stem]{.underline}
cross-border flows of [drugs and migrants]{.underline}. He has also
said, repeatedly, that Canada should become the 51st state and that
Washington should annex Greenland and reclaim control of the Panama
Canal. Altogether, that's a set of acquisitions stretching from the
tropics to the Arctic Circle.

Each of these ideas has its logic. Drugs and migration are immediate,
tangible threats to US security and sovereignty. **[[Chinese]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [has been [growing around]{.mark}
the]{.underline} militarily and economically vital [**[Panama
Canal]{.underline}**. [Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} [occupies
a]{.underline} **[[strategic location]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.mark} a]{.underline} warming, ever-more **[[contested
Artic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a long, unhappy history of
American designs on Canada. Yet what ties [[Trump's]{.mark}
pronouncements]{.underline} together is that they [[mark]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[revival]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.mark} an
older]{.underline} [**[strategic tradition]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Before the US was a global power, it was a regional power. From
independence to the early 20th century, the [crucial achievements of
Washington's policy involved expanding across the North American
continent]{.underline}, elbowing European powers out of Latin America,
and **[[consolidating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [hemisphere as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[bastion]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [American]{.underline}
**[[strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [That]{.underline} rough,
sometimes-violent program of national aggrandizement [created
the]{.underline} regional [foundation for America's]{.underline}
eventual [global influence]{.underline}: No Monroe Doctrine, no liberal
international order. And if continentalism seems like an anachronism, it
has become relevant again today.

[The need to]{.underline} [**[reconsolidate]{.underline}** [the
West]{.underline}ern]{.mark} Hemisphere [becomes more pressing as the
world]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} more
[div[i]{.mark}ded]{.underline}. As the US and China undergo a
slow-motion economic and trade decoupling, [the]{.underline} Western
[[Hemisphere]{.mark} looms]{.underline} larger [as a [source
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[lithium]{.underline}**,
**[r]{.underline}**are-**[e]{.underline}**arth
**[m]{.underline}**ineral**[s]{.underline}** [and other]{.underline}
**[[vital]{.mark} re[sources]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
[and]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} potential [home to]{.underline}
more geographically **[[secure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, geopolitically
[resilient]{.underline} [**[supply chains]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[As]{.underline} [**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [try to build]{.underline}
**[empires]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in their]{.underline} own
[regions]{.underline}, [the [need to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[cohesion]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [America's
[hemisphere]{.mark} grows]{.underline}. [In every great-power
struggle]{.underline} of the last century, [Washington aggressively
defended its]{.underline} regional [sanctuary]{.underline}: Why should
it be any different today?

Indeed, [threats to that sanctuary are growing.]{.underline}
Transnational challenges are becoming more severe, in the case of
migration, or more lethal, in the case of fentanyl.
[**[Geopolitical]{.underline}** [challenges are]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[resurgent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Russia has strong]{.underline} intelligence and security [[ties
with]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the region's most
[repressive]{.underline} [states, such as]{.underline}
**[Cuba]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Venezuela]{.underline}**.
[China's]{.underline} trade and technological [ties with]{.underline}
[**[Latin America]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[booming]{.underline}**]{.mark}; [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[built]{.mark}, or sought to control, critical]{.underline}
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from]{.underline}
**[Argentina]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[Greenland]{.underline}**. [It would be foolish]{.underline} for Trump
[to ignore the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}, [since America's
adversaries aren't]{.underline}.

The problem, as so often with Trump, is more the "how" than the "what."
[A]{.underline} bold, positive [program for hemispheric
integration]{.underline} --- [centering on]{.underline} [closer
**[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[investment
ti]{.mark}es]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [[stronger]{.underline}
**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [[would be a]{.underline}
**[no-brainer]{.underline}**]{.mark}. But the president-elect, of
course, is leading with outlandish demands and offensive threats.

[**[Dismiss scare]{.mark}** storie[**s** about]{.mark} an
**[isolationist]{.mark}** administration [staffed with]{.mark}
**unqualified [loyalists]{.mark}** determined to [**abandon** allies,
start]{.mark}]{.underline} trade [[**wars**, and sell
**Ukraine**]{.mark} down the river. An **evenhanded assessment** of the
[**record** show]{.mark}s that [Trump was]{.mark} an
**[effective]{.mark} fo**reign-**po**licy president, [presiding
over]{.mark} a **period** of]{.underline} relative [global
**[stability]{.mark}** and **prosperity**, and a second
Trump]{.underline} administration [promises **improved performance**
based on the **lessons learned** in the first term]{.underline}.

You can [expect a **[capable]{.mark}** foreign-policy [team]{.mark} that
will bring back]{.underline} an "America First" foreign-policy agenda
[with a [**focus** on **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline} through strength,
fair and reciprocal trade, alliance burden-sharing, ending the war in
Ukraine, getting tougher on China and Iran, securing the southern
border, and unleashing U.S. domestic energy potential.

[Personnel is policy]{.underline}, and there are many accomplished
candidates rumored to be in the running for top foreign-policy posts in
a second Trump administration, [including]{.underline} former Secretary
of State [Mike **Pompeo**]{.underline}, former National Security Advisor
[Robert **O'Brien**,]{.underline} Sen. [Marco **Rubio**]{.underline},
Sen. [Tom **Cotton**]{.underline}, former ambassador to Japan and
current Sen. [Bill **Hagerty**]{.underline}, former director of national
intelligence [and]{.underline} former Rep. [John
**Ratcliffe**]{.underline}, and others.

[These are **[seasoned pro]{.mark}**fessional**[s]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} have [**worked** with Trump]{.underline} over the years
[and [are]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[[trusted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
than the so-called [**adults** in the **room**]{.underline} from the
first term. As another former national security advisor, H.R. McMaster,
explains in a new book, Trump was burned by previous cabinet officials,
such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson, who thought they knew better than the president and
wrongly worked to obstruct his agenda. Trump rightly wants to avoid that
problem this time around.

After all, presidents consider loyalty when hiring staff. National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
for example, are President Joe Biden loyalists who worked with him for
years before being tapped for top posts.

With a like-minded team in place, the world can expect more policy
consistency from Trump 2.0 than in the first term.

[Contrary to charges of "**isolationism**,"]{.underline} the first
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [pursued a **globally
[engaged]{.mark}** foreign policy, including]{.underline} the
[projection of **military [force]{.mark}** [and **diplomatic**]{.mark}
**energy** [into]{.mark} the **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}** and
Trump's personal **diplomacy** with the leaders of **all**]{.underline}
major [**allies** and **adversaries** in both [**Europe** and
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[He [developed]{.mark} **close [relations]{.mark}**hips
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} some allies, such as
then-**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**ese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The
[**Abraham Accords** were a transformative step forward]{.underline} for
**[[Arab-Israeli]{.underline}]{.mark}** peace. The [summits with
**[Kim]{.mark}**]{.underline} Jong Un led to a cessation of North Korean
long-range missile tests for the remainder of Trump's presidency. To be
sure, not all of the diplomatic outreach, such as the trade negotiations
with Chinese President Xi Jinping, led to lasting breakthroughs, but
this extensive personal international engagement belies the notion that
Trump's inclinations are somehow isolationist.

His [[**withdrawal** fro]{.mark}m]{.underline} prominent treaties, such
as the [**[Iran]{.mark}** nuclear **[deal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, known
as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(**[[INF]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [Treaty, [were]{.mark} **not ev**idence
of isolationism]{.underline} as some wrongly claim, [but rather
**[pragmatic]{.mark}** judgments]{.underline} that these agreements were
not in America's interest. All the 2016 GOP presidential candidates
promised to pull out of the JCPOA due to its flaws, and it would have
been foolish to remain in the INF Treaty when Russia had
been cheating on the agreement for years.

[In defense policy,]{.underline} you can [expect a **philosophy** of
"**peace** through **strength**," making America **so strong** that
**no** adversary **dare challenge** it]{.underline}, with a willingness
to punch back hard when threatened. In his first term, Trump presided
over the largest defense budget in U.S. history at the time;
successfully prosecuted the war against the Islamic State; bombed Syria
after Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his
own people; and killed the coordinator of Iran's terror and proxy
networks, Gen. Qassem Suleimani.

[A major [increase in]{.mark} **defense [spending]{.mark}** will be
necessary for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies to **[counter]{.mark}** the **[new]{.mark} axis** of
**[autocracies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (China, Russia, Iran, and North
Korea) at the same time, but the Biden administration defense budgets
have not kept up with inflation. [Under Trump, expect an **increase** in
**defense spending**]{.underline} (perhaps proposing the first \$1
trillion U.S. defense budget) [and a **concerted [effort]{.mark}** [to
**revive**]{.mark} the **[d]{.mark}**efense **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase, including a [focus on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [Trump
[**priority** of]{.mark} a **[homeland m]{.mark}**issile
**[d]{.mark}**efense system, an "**[iron dome]{.mark}**," for the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. As the bipartisan

[Washington]{.underline} should [[build]{.mark} a **[m]{.mark}**issile

### Transition Wars

#### [Transition war]{.underline} is inevitable.

**Torrieri '23** \[Jeffrey D; Fall; Gettysburg College; Gettysburg
College Scholarship, "The Effect of Power Shifts on War,"
https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2174&context=student_scholarship\]

THE POWER TRANSITION THEORY

The power transition model, as originally spelled out in The War Ledger,
predicts that [nations are likely to become **aggressors**]{.underline}
[when]{.underline} [they are experiencing rising power yet]{.underline}
still [feel]{.underline} like [they are receiving a smaller share
of]{.underline} the [benefits than]{.underline} other equal, yet more
[established]{.underline}, [powers]{.underline} are receiving from the
international system. This is due to the fact that these rising powers
were not part of the original coalition of nations that built the
international order and, as a result, were not designed to receive the
advantages that other great powers are in such an order (Organski and
Kugler 1980). Without support from other great powers, these [rising
nations]{.underline} would logically [resort to
**aggression**]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} **[cement
themselves]{.underline}** in the position they think they deserve on the
world stage.

[Whether]{.underline} or not the [emergence of a rising
power]{.underline} disturbs the international system enough to
[cause]{.underline} a [war depends on]{.underline} some factors. Not
only does it depend on the size of the rising nation, but also on the
"**[speed]{.underline}** [with which modernization occurs]{.underline}
within big countries..." (Organski and Kugler 1980, 21). It is likely
only a **[rapid [shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in power]{.mark}
that]{.underline} would [[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur, [as a slow rise]{.underline}
in power would [give]{.underline} the [dominant nation]{.underline} more
[time to work out the problems]{.underline} that are occurring as the
rising nation transitions (Organski and Kugler 1980). Besides size and
speed, the **[level of [power]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the rising
nation actually achieves [**[relative]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} how much power [the]{.underline} **[[dominant
nation]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [rising nation that
achieves]{.mark}]{.underline} a [power]{.underline} **[nearly
[equal]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to the [power]{.mark}]{.underline} that
which [the dominant nation has will be]{.underline} more
[**[likely]{.underline}** [to **incite**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} system-changing **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Kim
1991; Kim 1992).

Woosang Kim adds to the power transition theory as expressed in The War
Ledger, arguing that [**[major war]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[becomes]{.underline} more [[likely]{.underline}
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [established]{.mark}]{.underline}
dominant [[nation feels **threatened**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the way
in which a newly rising power, a power which may become the new dominant
power, is changing the international order (1992). Kim writes,
"Threatened by demands for changes in the existing international order,
[the dominant nation has a **large stake** in preserving
the]{.underline} **[s]{.underline}**tatus **[quo]{.underline}**, in
which it [and its allies share]{.underline} the [benefits]{.underline}
and privileges of.... [The dominant nation]{.underline}, with the
support of its allies, [tries to thwart the challenger's
progress]{.underline}. [During]{.underline} such a period of **[power
transition]{.underline}**...[major power **war** is more
likely]{.underline}." (Kim 1992, 156-157). This means that [there are
two ways]{.underline} in which [power transition]{.underline} could
[lead to war]{.underline}; [if]{.underline} the [rising power feels left
out or]{.underline} if the [dominant power feels]{.underline} like they
are being [overshadowed]{.underline}.

The power transition theory can be useful when trying to figure out if a
contemporary situation in International Relations shows potential for
major conflict. One such situation is the rise of China as a potential
challenger to the United States as the dominant nation on earth (Clarke
2011). Throughout the bulk of this century, [China has been rapidly
growing]{.underline} both **[economically]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[militarily]{.underline}**. China has also been
seeing a sharp increase in the amount of soft power, which is the
ability for a nation to influence another nation without using force or
pressure, that it wields (Nguyen 2017). **[China]{.underline}** [has
been able to expand its soft]{.underline} **[power]{.underline}** by
exporting its culture to other parts of the world. For example, the
Chinese film industry has grown to become the second largest in the
world, and it is being used to promote Chinese culture to global
audiences (Nguyen 2017, 51). The expansion of soft power can be used by
China to rise in overall power more discreetly, as the actual effect of
soft power can't be measured as easily as something like GDP growth.
This discrete rise in power, when combined with its military and
economic expansion, will allow China to appear to be rising in power
even faster relative to the United States, which, according to Organski
and Kugler, is a main factor in increasing the likelihood that a power
transition will lead to war (1980).

The power transition theory is not without its flaws, as literature
exists that claims to disprove, or at least critique, Organski and
Kugler's theory. According to one critique, very few of the dominant
nations since the beginning of modern International Relations (1648),
"were seriously threatened by rising powers or coalitions of great
powers. They went to war because they thought they were powerful enough
to become more powerful still" (Lebow and Valentino 2009, 405). One of
the nations that Lebow and Valentino reference as not seriously
threatened by coalitions of great powers was Nazi Germany (2009). I
would argue that, if you actually examine this time period from the
perspective of the power transition theory, it was **[[Nazi]{.mark}
[Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[was]{.mark} the **rising
power**]{.underline} [[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} the declining
dominance of [**[Britain]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[France]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} [Britain and France
declared]{.underline} that [they would fight Germany]{.underline} if it
invaded Poland [out of]{.underline} **[fear]{.underline}** [of Germany
**superseding**]{.underline} them [as the dominant power]{.underline} if
they were to successfully do so. Such an explanation would also fit in
with Woosang Kim's addition to the power transition theory stating that
[a dominant power would be]{.underline} [willing to go to war
for]{.underline} the sake of [preserving the]{.underline}
[s]{.underline}tatus [quo]{.underline} from which they benefit, as
Britain and France had enjoyed effectively running Europe postWorld War
I until Hitler became aggressive (1992).

THE THEORY OF HEGEMONIC WAR

Another theory that builds upon ideas similar to the ones laid out in
the power transition theory is **[[Thucydides'
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} **[hegemonic
war]{.underline}**. This theory essentially [[says]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the [[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, or instability, [of the
international system is [determined by]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[presence]{.underline}, or absence, [of a **[rigid
hierarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline} of nations, [[topped by]{.mark} a
**clear [hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which can be defined as single
dominant power the global order (Snidal 1985)), free of economic or
political disturbances (Gilpin 1988). In a disturbed system, the threat
of instability [[breaking]{.mark} the [hierarchy]{.mark}]{.underline} of
nations [has the potential to **[ignite]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
**[hegemonic [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which can lead to a system
change if the hierarchy is successfully broken by the conflict (Gilpin
1988).

In the modern day, the theory of hegemonic war, like the power
transition theory, can be examined when looking at the rise of
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[is]{.mark} predicted to
be]{.underline} "[an **[aggressive]{.mark} state**]{.underline}
determined to achieve regional hegemony" (Beeson 2009, 95). [[If
China]{.mark} was to try and [claim]{.mark}]{.underline} this
[[heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline} in this type of way, [it
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} surely [[shake up]{.mark} the US-led [global
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [China would be]{.underline} essentially
[taking]{.underline} a major region of the world, [East
Asia,]{.underline} [out of US control]{.underline}. Given that [China's
economy and military have been growing rapidly]{.underline} over the
last few decades, the [nation]{.underline} has become the world's
largest importer and exporter of goods, and [has seen its]{.underline}
[**military budget** rise by almost a **factor of ten**]{.underline} in
the past twenty years, it seems [the country is gaining
power]{.underline} enough to attempt a reclamation of the region (Nguyen
2017). Furthermore, the East Asian powerhouse [has already begun to
challenge the US]{.underline} "[through trade]{.underline} agreements,
political [rhetoric]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} regional
[organizations]{.underline} that together build up a soft balance
against the U.S. primacy" (Nguyen 2017, 58). [[If]{.mark} this challenge
gets to a point that the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [begins to [feel]{.mark} a
[disturbance]{.mark} in the]{.underline} current
**[hierarchy]{.underline}** of nations, [a]{.underline} **[hegemonic
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} very possibly
[[occur]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Though the theory of hegemonic war is useful in examining possible
threats to the current international system, it is far from a perfect
theory. One issue with the theory is that it assumes that "collective
action in the international system is impossible in the absence of a
dominant state," even though "Graphical analysis...show\[s\] that
cooperation can not only be sustained in the face of declining hegemony,
it may even be enhanced." (Snidal 1985, 579-580). Such information could
disprove the hegemonic war theory's assumption that the absence of a
rigid hierarchical structure of the international system with a hegemon
on top will lead to turmoil, seeing as how cooperation is the opposite
of conflict. On the contrary, however, one could point to instances in
history where the absence of a clear hegemon led to instability, and
eventually to system-changing war. Webb and Krasner point out that in
the period between the first and second World Wars, a time marked by
political instability in Europe and global economic depression, Britain,
which acted as the global hegemon before the first World War, had lost
its ability to do so, and the United States, which emerged from World
War I as the only real candidate to replace Britain, refused to assume
such a role (1989). I would add that the fact that **[[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} **[deadliest]{.underline}**
[system-changing war in **history**]{.underline}, directly
[[followed]{.underline}]{.mark} this [inter-war [time
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[hegemonic instability]{.underline}**]{.mark}
further [[proves]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[**[turmoil]{.underline}** [caused by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} [**[absence]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the international order could
**[[outweigh]{.underline}]{.mark}** any [[attempts at]{.mark}
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.

APPLICATIONS TO ASSUMPTIONS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

The theories I elaborate on above are inextricably linked to broader
theoretical perspectives on the study of International Relations. The
power transition theory, as well as the theory of hegemonic war, to an
extent, are fundamentally identified with neorealist theory because of
the focus on national security as the chief concern of major powers in
the international system. Neorealists, as we learned in class, make the
following assumptions about the international system: states are the
only significant actors, the issues that states face are arranged in a
fixed, hierarchical structure with national security always at the top,
and states act as a unitary actor. The power transition theory looks
exclusively at how states interact within the international system,
ignoring any supranational powers, international organizations, or even
individual actors that could alter the course that these states take on
the way to power transition. Organski, Kugler, and even Gilpin seem to
consider all of the various actors, both groups and individuals, within
states as part of one whole, which is a fundamentally neorealist idea.
This comes as no surprise, especially considering that the theory of
hegemonic war is based on the writing of Thucydides, who was the ancient
Greek historian considered the father of the realist theories.

CONCLUSION

By examining the assumptions that are made by both the power transition
theory and the theory of hegemonic war, which I have determined can hold
up to the scrutiny of critical opinions, I have determined that my
original hypothesis, which is that **[system-changing
wars]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} more **[likely]{.underline}** to
occur [when a major actor experiences a **rapid shift**]{.underline} [in
power]{.underline} in either direction, is supported. The power
transition theory supports this hypothesis by explaining the idea that a
[state that is **quickly rising**]{.underline} [in power
can]{.underline} often [cause the state that is]{.underline} already in
the [dominant]{.underline} state of power, or is slipping out of the
dominant state of power, [to feel **threatened**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} could [lead]{.underline} [to]{.underline} a **[major
war]{.underline}** [between these powers]{.underline}. The theory of
hegemonic war validates this hypothesis by explaining a similar
phenomenon in which [a hegemonic power]{.underline}, when
[feeling]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} [international
system]{.underline} allowing them to retain such dominant power
[is]{.underline} in danger of [collapsing, is likely to initiate
a]{.underline} **[major conflict]{.underline}** [in an attempt to
preserve the system]{.underline}.

I believe both of these theories are useful in making predictions about
how the current, rapidly [**[rising power]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in a
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates-[led]{.underline}
international [system [could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[lead
to]{.mark} the first **[system-changing war]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[since]{.underline} **[1945]{.underline}**. Knowing that these theories
have merit to them, we can assume that it is at least possible that
preventing future relations between the United States and China from
turning into a power struggle where the US is feeling as if China is
trying to undermine or overtake it could make a difference in preventing
system changing wars. The next step would be trying to figure out
meaningful policy goals that both nations could advance to proactively
stop such a disaster from occurring. That, however, is a question for a
different time.

On August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise cross-border
offensive into Russia's Kursk region---the biggest foreign incursion
into Russian territory since World War II. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's response was telling. Days after Ukraine's offensive, [[Putin
**railed**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Europe]{.underline}. "The West is fighting us with the hands of the
Ukrainians," he said, [[reiterating]{.mark} his [view that Russia's
war]{.mark} [in Ukraine is]{.mark} in fact a **[proxy
battle]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
he initiated no immediate military counterattack. Putin was unwilling to
divert substantial numbers of troops away from their operations in
eastern Ukraine even to recover territory back home. Three months later,
with Ukrainian forces still in Kursk, Moscow instead brought in North
Korean troops to help push them out---the first time in more than a
century that Russia has invited foreign troops onto its soil.

Moscow's actions underscore how, after almost three years since Russia's
full-scale invasion of its neighbor, [[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
more **[[committed]{.underline}]{.mark}** than ever
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the war with Ukraine and [his broader
[confrontation with]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
[the [conflict is]{.mark} first]{.underline} and foremost
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[imperial pursuit]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to end Ukraine's independence,]{.underline} [Putin's ultimate
[objectives are to **relitigate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [post--Cold
War **order**]{.mark} in Europe,]{.underline} [[weaken]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[and usher in]{.mark} a
**[new]{.mark} international [system]{.mark}**]{.underline} that affords
Russia the status and influence Putin believes it deserves.

These goals are not new. But [the war has hardened Putin's
resolve]{.underline} and narrowed his options. There is no turning back:
[Putin has]{.underline} already [transformed Russia's society, economy,
and foreign policy to]{.underline} better position the Kremlin to [take
on the West]{.underline}. [[Having accepted]{.mark} the [mantle of a
**rogue**]{.mark} **regime**]{.underline}, [[Russia is]{.mark} now even
[less likely to see]{.mark} a [need for constraint]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The stage is set for the **confrontation**]{.underline} with Russia [to
intensify]{.underline}, despite the incoming Trump administration's
apparent interest in normalizing relations with Moscow. The war is not
going well for Ukraine, in part because the [limited
assistance]{.underline} the West has sent to Kyiv [does not match the
deep stake it claims to have in the conflict]{.underline}. As a result,
[[Russia]{.mark} is [likely to walk away]{.mark} from the
war]{.underline} [**[emboldened]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[once it has
**reconstituted**]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline}
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** capacity, [[spoiling for **another**
fight]{.mark} to revise the **security order** in
**Europe**.]{.underline} What's more, [the [Kremlin will]{.mark} look to
[pocket]{.mark} any [concessions]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Trump
administration for ending the current war, such as sanctions relief, [to
strengthen its hand]{.underline} for the next one. [[Russia
is]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[preparing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
ground [[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[sabotage]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other [special operations it has unleashed
across Europe and through its **[alignment]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} other
**rogue actors**, including [**Iran** and **No**]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea. European countries are only slightly
more prepared to handle the Russian challenge on their own than they
were three years ago. And depending on how the war in Ukraine ends, the
[[possibility of]{.mark} **another [war]{.mark}** with Russia
[looms]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The question is **not**]{.underline} [whether Russia will pose a
threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies [but how
to]{.underline} assess the magnitude of the danger and the effort
required to **[contain]{.underline}** [it]{.underline}. China will
remain the United States' primary competitor. But even with much of its
attention called to Asia, [Washington cannot ignore a]{.underline}
recalcitrant and **[[revanchist adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
Europe]{.underline}, especially not one [that [will pose]{.mark} a
direct [**military threat** to **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} members.

The Russian problem is also a global one. [Putin's [willingness to
**invade**]{.mark}]{.underline} a neighbor, **[assault]{.underline}**
[democratic societies, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} generally
**[[violate]{.underline}]{.mark}** accepted
**[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and his seeming ability to get away
with it---[[paves the way for others]{.mark} to do the
same]{.underline}.The [Kremlin's provision of military
equipment]{.underline} and know-how to current and aspiring U.S.
adversaries [will amplify]{.underline} these **[threats]{.underline}**,
[[multiplying]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}
that Washington will face [[from]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [and any other country]{.underline}
that Russia backs.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
and Europe, therefore, [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} invest in
[[resist]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} now [or
pay a far greater cost]{.underline} later. The incoming
[Trump]{.underline} administration, in particular, [does not
have]{.underline} the [luxury of shoving]{.underline} [Russia down its
list of]{.underline} policy [priorities]{.underline}. If
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} sees Washington doing so, he [[will
grow]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[more]{.underline}
**[brazen]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[ambitious]{.underline}** in his efforts to weaken the United States
and its allies, both directly and through the axis of upheaval that
Russia supports. To prevent that outcome, [Washington]{.underline} and
its allies [must help Ukraine]{.underline} strengthen its position ahead
of negotiations to end the current war. The United States is right to
prioritize China, but in order to effectively compete with Beijing, it
first needs to set European security on the right path. Washington must
remain the primary enabler of that security for now, while making sure
that Europe ramps up the investments required to better handle its own
defense in the years ahead. By taking the steps necessary to counter
Russia today, the United States and Europe can ensure that the threat
they face tomorrow will be a manageable one.

IN TOO DEEP

Putin has changed Russia in ways that will ensure it remains a challenge
to the West as long as he is in power and likely well beyond.
[[Confrontation]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline} now [the]{.underline}
**[hallmark]{.underline}** [of Russia's foreign policy,
with]{.underline} [Putin citing his]{.underline} country's
"**[[existential struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [with the
West]{.underline} to justify his regime and its actions. This [[idea of
a Russian civilization]{.mark} [in]{.mark} **constant
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[West]{.mark}ern foes [strengthens]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[ideological foundation]{.underline}** [of his rule---a source of
**[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} he now needs [to safeguard his hold
on power.]{.underline}

Putin's increased reliance on repression has generated risks to the
stability of his regime. Political science research shows that
repression is effective in the sense that it increases autocrats'
longevity in office. But depending too heavily on it, as Putin has done,
can raise the prospect that leaders will make destabilizing mistakes.
Heavy-handed tactics compel people to mask their private views and avoid
sharing anything but what the government wants to hear, which means the
autocrat, too, loses access to accurate information. High levels of
repression also create a rising reservoir of general dissatisfaction, so
that [even a small outburst of discontent can quickly spiral into
trouble for the regime]{.underline}. To mitigate these risks and
reinforce his hold on power, [Putin]{.underline} has [used]{.underline}
[his control over]{.underline} the [info]{.underline}rmation environment
[to convince]{.underline} the [Russian people that their country is at
war with a West that wants to break it apart.]{.underline}

The war has hardened Putin's resolve and narrowed his options.

[[Putin]{.mark} has also **[reoriented]{.mark}** the Russian
[**economy** around]{.mark} his **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russia's
**[[defense spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is]{.underline} [set to
[reach]{.mark} its **[highest point]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, with \$145 billion allocated in the 2025
budget---[the equivalent of]{.underline} **[6.3 percent]{.underline}**
[of GDP and more than **double**]{.underline} the \$66 billion Russia
budgeted for defense in [2021]{.underline}, the year before the
invasion. And [the true amount of]{.underline} such [spending
will]{.underline} likely [be **higher**]{.underline}, possibly
[exceeding **eight percent** of GDP]{.underline}, once other, unofficial
forms of defense-related expenditures are accounted for.
([When]{.underline} also [adjusting for]{.underline} considerable
differences in [purchasing power]{.underline} parity between Russia and
the United States, [Russia's actual defense spending is]{.underline}
much higher than \$145 billion, [exceeding **\$200
billion**]{.underline}.) Russian factories producing military equipment
have added shifts to increase production; [workers]{.underline} have
[moved]{.underline} from civilian [to military sectors]{.underline},
where the wages are higher; [and payouts for military
service]{.underline} have [skyrocketed]{.underline}. [The war has become
a]{.underline} **[wealth transfer]{.underline}** [mechanism]{.underline}
channeling money to Russia's poor regions, and many economic
[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[moved into]{.mark} the
[defense]{.mark} sector]{.underline} to cash in on lucrative
opportunities. Elites have, by now, adjusted to the system's current
configuration, enabling them not just to survive but to profit from it.

Having gone through the pain of shifting the economy to a wartime
footing and feeling the pressure of new vested interests, [Putin is
unlikely to undo these changes]{.underline} quickly. After the fighting
in Ukraine ends, [he will]{.underline} probably instead [look to justify
the continuation of the wartime economy]{.underline}. Such was the
inclination of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who, after the Allied
victory in World War II, soon began to speak of Moscow's new five-year
plans as necessary preparation for the next inevitable war.

Russian foreign policy is also transforming in ways that will be
difficult to undo. The [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[made it]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for Russia
[to build ties]{.mark} with the West]{.underline}, and Moscow has had to
look for opportunities elsewhere. [Its [deepening partnerships
wi]{.mark}th]{.underline} [**[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea may
[have been driven]{.underline} largely [by necessity]{.underline}:
[Russia needs their help to sustain its]{.underline} economy and
[warfighting machine]{.underline}. But Moscow also [understands that by
working with these countries, it is in a better position to
sustain]{.underline} a long-term [competition with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies. Not
only does their support make Russia less isolated and less vulnerable to
the United States' tools of economic warfare; [Russia]{.underline} also
[benefits from having]{.underline} **[cobelligerents]{.underline}**
working in tandem [to weaken the West]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has
gone all in on]{.underline} these partnerships, having abandoned caution
in [cooperating with]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea, overcome its concern with overdependence on
**[China]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} elevated relations with
**[Iran]{.underline}** beyond transactional engagement. All of this
amounts to a new strategy for Moscow, one that will not simply disappear
after the fighting in Ukraine subsides or ends.

RUSSIA RELOADS

[Russia's military threat is not going away]{.underline}, either. [The
question of Russian military reconstitution is **not an if** but a
**when**]{.underline}. Even if Russia cannot sustain its current wartime
spending, the [defense]{.underline} [budget is likely to
remain]{.underline} substantially [above prewar levels]{.underline} for
some time to come. The Russian [military]{.underline}, too, [is unlikely
to shrink]{.underline} back to the relatively small army Russia fielded
before the war. One lesson that Russia's military brass took from
Ukraine is that the Russian army was not "Soviet" enough in that it
lacked mass and the capacity to replace losses. In reality, the Russian
military was stuck in a halfway state, having acquired some advanced or
modernized capabilities but also retaining some Soviet-era
characteristics, including conscription and a culture of centralized
command that discouraged initiative. Now, [Russia is likely to maintain
a large]{.underline} overall [force]{.underline} with an expanded
structure and greater manpower allocation, although it will still depend
on mobilization in the event of war to reduce the cost of its standing
army.

Reconstitution is about not just materiel but also the capacity to
conduct large-scale combat operations.The [[Russian]{.mark} military has
shown that it can learn]{.underline} as an organization; [it is capable
of]{.underline} [[scaling]{.underline}]{.mark} the deployment of new
[tech]{.underline}nology [such as **[drones]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[electronic]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**fare systems onto the battlefield, and it
will be a changed force after its experience in Ukraine. Despite its
initial poor showing, the Russian military has demonstrated staying
power and the ability to withstand high levels of attrition.

Russia's military reconstitution will face headwinds, especially from
the country's limited defense industrial capacity and skilled labor
shortage. Russian industry has not been able to significantly scale the
production of major platforms and weapons systems. [Labor and machine
tools remain]{.underline} major [constraints]{.underline} because of
Western sanctions and export controls. [Russia has still been able
to]{.underline} significantly [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[production of **missiles**]{.underline},
**[p]{.underline}**]{.mark}[recision-**[g]{.mark}**uided
**[w]{.mark}**eapons, [**drones**, and]{.mark} artillery
**[munitions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and it has set up an effective
repair and refurbishment pipeline for existing equipment. [But it is
also drawing from aging stocks]{.underline} that it inherited from the
Soviet Union for much of its land force equipment. Thus, as it expands
its forces and replaces losses, it is depleting its resources.

From now on, the Russian military will have a duality to it, with areas
of strength but equally prominent weaknesses. On the one hand, it has
become much better at dynamic targeting, precision strikes, the
integration of drones in combat operations, and more sophisticated
methods of employing long-range precision-guided weapons. [Russia
has]{.underline} adapted to---and in some cases [developed effective
tactics to counter]{.underline}---the [Western capabilities]{.underline}
it confronted in Ukraine. Over time, Russian forces reorganized
logistics and command and control, coming up with ways to reduce the
efficacy of Western equipment and intercept Western munitions, and they
have learned to operate with the presence of Western long-range
precision-guided weapons, intelligence, and targeting.

[For]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**, [this ought to set off
**alarms**]{.underline}. Some analysts argue that the way Ukraine is
fighting now is not the way NATO would fight in a potential future war
with Russia.They contend specifically that NATO would quickly earn and
maintain air superiority, changing the nature of the conflict. Although
this may be true, airpower will not solve every battlefield challenge
NATO might face. And most European air forces lack munitions for a
sustained conventional war. The time it would take to deplete their
arsenals can best be measured in weeks and in many cases days.

On the other hand, a substantial percentage of the Russian ground force
will likely continue to field dated Soviet equipment, and it will take
years to rebuild force quality and replace the officers lost in
Ukraine.The outlook for Russia's defense capacity will also depend on
whether its economy is running flat out and the defense sector has
already maximized production or if there is still room for production to
increase as new and refurbished plants and facilities come online.
Overall, the Russian military will remain a patchwork, with some parts
more advanced and capable than they were at the start of 2022 and other
parts still using equipment from the middle of the Cold War, if not
earlier. But the chances of the Russian armed forces being decisively
knocked out and unable to pose a major threat for a prolonged period are
low.

A GROWING GAP

The [[risks from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[reconstitution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Russia's military [are
[compounded by]{.mark} the West's **[lackluster]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[response]{.mark} to rising]{.underline} **[Russian
aggression]{.underline}**. Europe still has a long way to go before it
is prepared to handle the threat from Russia on its own. European
defense production is insufficient to meet rearmament goals, despite
Europe's advantages in capital, machine tools, and labor productivity.
European countries have substantially depleted their stocks by
transferring older equipment to Ukraine, limiting their militaries'
mobilization potential. These countries will soon face the dual pressure
of funding Ukraine's war effort and recovery while replacing their own
expended war materiel. Given how limited their arsenals were to begin
with, if they want to be equipped to handle Russian belligerence, they
will need to build well beyond 2022 levels---not just restore what was
lost.

Current trends suggest that [although European defense spending is
likely to rise,]{.underline} the [increases may]{.underline} [not be
enough]{.underline} to significantly expand military capability. There
are exceptions, such as Poland and the Baltic states. But many countries
with large budgets, such as Italy and Spain, are lagging behind. Many
have yet to meet the commitment made by all NATO allies to spend the
equivalent of two percent of GDP on defense. Across Europe, defense
production is constrained by industrial capacity, the slow pace of
finalizing contracts, and competing budgetary imperatives. All these
issues can be overcome with sufficient political will, but European
leaders first have to be clear-eyed in their assessment of the security
environment. The United States is not going to significantly expand its
presence in Europe; at best, Washington's commitment to European
security will remain constant as it pushes Europe to do more, and there
is a real risk that it will turn its focus elsewhere. Europe must
prepare to foot more of the bill to ensure that Ukraine is in a position
to defend itself and to deter future Russian aggression against both
Ukraine and Europe as a whole.

[American leaders]{.underline}, for their part, [will have to be
**realistic** about Europe's capabilities]{.underline}. Even those
countries that are now investing heavily in equipment and procurement
are still having issues recruiting, retaining, and training sufficient
forces. And [defense spending does not easily translate]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} the ability to conduct [large]{.underline}-scale
combat [op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}. Modern operations are
complex, and [European countries]{.underline} generally
**[cannot]{.underline}** [execute them **without** U.S.
support]{.underline}. [Most militaries]{.underline} on the continent
[have coevolved to **complement**]{.underline} [the U.S.
military]{.underline} rather than to operate independently.

European militaries and NATO have made some progress matching their
defense investments with the requirements of regional defense plans. But
the [forces]{.underline} active [on the continent are not capable of
handling a **large-scale war** on their own]{.underline}. They would
find it difficult to agree on who would lead such an operation and who
would provide the necessary supporting elements. [European militaries
would struggle to defend a]{.underline} fellow [NATO
member]{.underline}, or Ukraine, **[without]{.underline}** [U.S.
help]{.underline}---a dependence that Washington has, to some extent,
perpetuated. Thus, although the United States should continue to press
its European allies to take on more of the security burden, Washington
must appreciate that it will take a long time for Europe to get there.

THE RISING RISK OF WAR

Europe and the United States are not preparing for some far-off threat.
[[Moscow]{.mark} is already [waging]{.mark} an **[unconventional
war]{.mark}** against Europe]{.underline}. Within the past few years,
[suspected Russian-backed actors have [**set fire**]{.mark} to
warehouses in Germany and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom that were [full of arms and ammunition for
Ukraine, [**tampered** with water]{.mark}]{.underline} purification
[centers in Finland, **[pushed migrants]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the
Middle East and North Africa crossing through Belarus and Russia
[to]{.underline} the borders of [Poland and Finland, **[targeted
railway]{.mark}** infrastructure in the Czech Republic and Sweden,
**[assassinated]{.mark}**]{.underline} a Russian military
[defector]{.underline} in Spain[, and even plotted to assassinate
the]{.underline} German [head of]{.underline} a major [European arms
manufacturer]{.underline}. The Kremlin's goal with these measures is to
show European governments and citizens that Russia can retaliate for
their support for Kyiv.

Yet once the war in Ukraine ends, [Russia's efforts won't
subside.]{.underline} [Moscow's broader aim in pursuing]{.underline}
[these tactics is to **degrade**]{.underline} [the West and its ability
to counter Russia]{.underline}. [It wants to **weaken** Western
societies, **drive wedges** between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} **[Europe]{.underline}**,
[reduce Europe's capacity]{.underline} for collective action, [and
convince Europeans]{.underline} that [it's not worth]{.underline} the
trouble [to push back]{.underline} against Moscow. [Part of its strategy
is to use **[nuclear intimidation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} the recent [changes to]{.underline} Russian [nuclear
doctrine that]{.underline} seem to [[lower]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threshold for]{.mark} nuclear [use, to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[heighten]{.underline}** [Western]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} [confronting
Russia.]{.underline}

The stage is set for the West's confrontation with Russia to intensify.

[Russia is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [in a position to
challenge NATO directly.]{.underline} The current [low-scale
conflict]{.underline} with NATO countries [is likely to persist until
the]{.underline} Russian [military rebuilds]{.underline}---a process
that could take years. But [the Kremlin will]{.underline} then be
[look]{.underline}ing for opportunities [to]{.underline} further
[undermine NATO]{.underline}. [[Moscow]{.mark} will still]{.underline}
[have reason for **caution**]{.underline}, not least [because it
considers the alliance to be a **superior force**]{.underline}, [but it
may be [tempted if it becomes clear]{.mark} that]{.underline} the
allies---[the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates the most important among
them---[[lack]{.mark} the **[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[for]{.mark} **collective [defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Kremlin
would be most prone to make this calculation if the United States is
engaged in a major conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific, which
Washington has deemed its highest national security priority. [Should
the Kremlin calculate that Washington would not]{.underline} or could
not [come to Europe's defense]{.underline} and that Europe alone would
not be capable of victory, [[then Moscow could **target**]{.mark} a
country on [**NATO**'s eastern flank]{.mark}, daring NATO to
respond.]{.underline}

The [picture is]{.underline} further [complicated by]{.underline} the
[[Kremlin's propensity for]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[**[risk-taking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**]{.mark}ulation. Already, [Moscow has
**seriously misjudged**]{.underline} [its ability to]{.underline}
rapidly [defeat]{.underline} the [Ukrain]{.underline}ian military
[and]{.underline} to shake [Western resolve]{.underline}. Personalist
autocrats such as [Putin are]{.underline} the type of leader most
[inclined to make **mistakes**]{.underline}, in part [because they
surround themselves with]{.underline} **[yes men]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[loyalists]{.underline}** who tell the leaders what
they want to hear. Washington and its allies should thus not sleep
comfortably even if NATO forces are well equipped to defeat the Russian
military. Having confidence that NATO would prevail in the end is not
enough, especially having observed what Ukraine is experiencing now:
cities destroyed, tens of thousands killed, millions made refugees, and
areas under prolonged Russian occupation. Even if Russia were defeated
today, a future [war with Russia could be devastating]{.underline} for
the country it invades and for the NATO alliance. [The **imperative**
for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[St]{.underline}**ates [and NATO is to
make sure Moscow **never tries.**]{.underline}

AIDING AND ABETTING

The confrontation with Russia will remain most intense in Europe, but
[the challenge from Moscow]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}**. Although the United States and Europe levied
significant costs on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine,
Moscow has circumvented Western sanctions and export controls and defied
predictions of international isolation. In October, [Russia
hosted]{.underline} the annual summit of **[BRICS]{.underline}** (whose
first five members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa),
[with dozens of world leaders]{.underline} in attendance,
[demonstrating]{.underline} a growing interest in [the group's
role]{.underline} as a platform for [challenging Western
power]{.underline} and influence.

[[The more]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[clashes]{.underline}** [with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies [and is
perceived to [get away with it, the more]{.mark} other
[countries]{.mark} will be]{.underline} [**[emboldened]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} issue **[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**s of
their own. Russia's war in Ukraine is exposing not only a gap between
the West's rhetoric and its practical commitment but also the limits of
Western military capacity. This is not to say that a seeming Russian
success in Ukraine would automatically prompt Chinese leader Xi Jinping
to invade Taiwan; other factors, such as the military balance of power
in the region and political imperatives in Beijing, will be more
decisive in shaping Xi's calculus. Yet [**[China]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[taking notes]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [as are
onlookers]{.underline} around the world. Would-be Western [adversaries
are assessing the price of]{.underline} using [force]{.underline} and
considering what they might expect were they to launch a similar gambit.
Likewise, the **[inadequate response]{.underline}** [to
Russia]{.underline}n sabotage in Europe [might encourage
other]{.underline} potential [foes]{.underline} to get in the game.

Not content to simply inspire, [Moscow is]{.underline} also actively
[aiding opponents]{.underline} of the West. Russia [has]{.underline}
[lent support to **rogue actors**]{.underline} across the Sahel region
[of Africa]{.underline}, dispensing materiel and diplomatic backing that
enabled military officials to forcibly seize power in Mali in 2021, in
Burkina Faso in 2022, and in Niger in 2023 and subsequently curtail ties
with the United States and Europe. Russia is also sending arms into
Sudan, prolonging the country's civil war and the resulting humanitarian
crisis, [and has lent support to the Houthi]{.underline} militias in
Yemen, who have attacked vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting global
trade, and have fired missiles at Israel, a close U.S. ally.

Although the consequences for the United States of any one of these
developments may be limited, in aggregate, [Russia's actions are
magnifying]{.underline} the [challenges]{.underline} facing Washington.
[In Niger,]{.underline} [Russian support eased the]{.underline} new
[government's decision to force the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to abandon a
base]{.underline} it used to launch counterterrorism missions in the
Sahel. [If Russia were to ramp up]{.underline} its [support]{.underline}
[for the Houthis]{.underline} and provide them with antiship missiles,
[the]{.underline} militant [group would be better able to]{.underline}
[strike]{.underline} commercial [vessels]{.underline} in the Red Sea
[and raise the threat to]{.underline} the U.S. and European
**[warships]{.underline}** defending them. Once the fighting in Ukraine
ends, Russia could devote significantly more resources and attention to
the Houthis and other groups or countries that threaten U.S. interests.

Some observers have held out hope that China's concern for its economic
interests will induce it to rein in Russia. But Beijing's actions so far
indicate no such effort. China did not object to Russia's support for
the Houthis, despite the risks to global shipping. Even if Beijing is
wary of Russia's deepening relations with North Korea, it is unlikely to
intervene, not least because it does not want to spoil its long-standing
relationship with Pyongyang. Instead, China seems content to let Russia
roil the international system and take advantage of the resulting
disorder to further its own rise. If there is to be any check on
Russia's destabilizing activities, then, it will have to come from the
West.

THE AXIS OF UPHEAVAL

[Russia's effort to support **China**]{.underline},
**[Iran]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [is among the most pernicious
problems]{.underline} posed by Moscow. Russia's war in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has [spurred]{.underline} a level of
**[coop]{.underline}**eration among those countries that few thought was
possible, and the Kremlin has operated as the critical catalyst. The
arrival of North Korean troops in Russia is a worrisome reminder that
[with]{.underline} highly personalized [authoritarian regimes at the
helm in]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** and
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea and with the regimes in
**[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} to a lesser extent
**[Iran]{.underline}** moving in this direction,
**[coop]{.underline}**eration [can evolve rapidly]{.underline} and in
unpredictable ways.

A body of political science research shows that [this]{.underline}
particular [type of regime tends to produce the **most risky** and
**aggressive** foreign policies]{.underline}. [Countries
with]{.underline} personalist **[[authoritarians]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[at the helm are]{.underline} the [[most likely to
initiate]{.underline}]{.mark} **[interstate
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the most likely to **[[fight
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against democracies, and]{.underline} the
most likely to [[invest in]{.underline}
**[nuc]{.underline}**]{.mark}lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Russia's]{.underline} growing military and political
[support]{.underline} for China, Iran, and North Korea
[will]{.underline} only [facilitate these tendencies]{.underline}. And
[Moscow]{.underline}, by now having shed its concern with its
international reputation, [is likely to become]{.underline} even [less
constrained]{.underline} in its willingness to aid even the most odious
of regimes.

[[Russian]{.mark} support]{.underline} for fellow members of this axis
of upheaval, therefore, [could [bring **disorder** to
**key**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take the
[Chinese-Russian]{.underline} relationship. Although Moscow has supplied
Beijing with arms for years---including advanced fighter aircraft, air
defense systems, and antiship missiles---their [defense ties have
deepened]{.underline} at an alarming rate. In September, for example,
U.S. officials announced that [Russia]{.underline} had [provided China
with sophisticated tech]{.underline}nology that will make Chinese
submarines quieter and more difficult to track. Such an agreement was
hard to imagine just a few years ago, given the sensitive nature of the
technology. With Beijing and Moscow working together, the [U.S. military
advantage]{.underline} over China [could erode,
[making]{.mark}]{.underline} a potential [**[conflict]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}** [more
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline} if China believes it has the upper hand.

The costs of resisting Russia will only rise.

[[Russia's support for Iran is]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly
[[troubling]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Moscow]{.mark} has]{.underline} long
[[sent]{.underline} **[tanks]{.underline}**,
**[helicopters]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} [surface-to-air
**[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Tehran, [and]{.underline} it [is
now supporting]{.underline} the Iranian space and [missile
programs]{.underline}. Since Russia's intervention in Syria in 2015 to
shore up the rule of President Bashar al-Assad---joining Iran in that
effort---Moscow and Tehran's increased interaction has enabled them to
overcome a historic distrust and build the foundations of a deeper and
more durable partnership. A decade ago, Russia participated (if warily)
in the international negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear
deal. But today, Moscow seems far less interested in arms reduction or
nonproliferation. As the wars in the Middle East degrade Iran's proxies
and expose the limits of its ability to deter Israel, [[Tehran's
interest in acquiring a **nuc**]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon [may
grow]{.underline}---and [it [may turn to Russia]{.mark} for
help.]{.underline} That help could be overt, [with Moscow
offering]{.underline} the **[expertise]{.underline}** needed for weapon
miniaturization, for example, [or]{.underline} it could be indirect,
with Russia [shielding Tehran from UN action]{.underline}. [[Iran's
acquisition]{.mark} of a]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon,
in turn, [could [send]{.mark} other countries in the region, such as
**[Egypt]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}**, **[[scrambling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to]{.underline} **[nuclearize]{.underline}**, effectively
**[[ending]{.underline}]{.mark}** the current era of
**[[nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

In the case of North Korea, [Russia]{.underline}'s support
[raises]{.underline} the [risk of **instability**]{.underline} [on
the]{.underline} Korean [Peninsula]{.underline}. According to South
Korean officials, [Pyongyang]{.underline} has [requested advanced
Russian tech]{.underline}nologies [to]{.underline} [improve]{.underline}
the accuracy of its [ballistic missiles and]{.underline} to expand the
range of its [sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline} in return for North
Korea sending its troops, ammunition, and other military support to
Russia. And it is not just advanced equipment that [[could
make]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [more]{.underline}
**[able]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, perhaps, more
**[willing]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [[engage in]{.mark} a
**regional [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. North Korean [troops
deployed to Russia are]{.underline} now [gaining]{.underline} valuable
[battlefield experience]{.underline} and insight into modern conflict.
[Moscow and Pyongyang]{.underline} also [signed]{.underline} a treaty in
November establishing a "comprehensive [strategic
partnership]{.underline}" and [calling on each side]{.underline} [to
come to the other's aid]{.underline} in case of an armed attack---[an
agreement that could]{.underline} potentially [bring]{.underline}
[Russia into a fight between]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea.

[It is **tempting**]{.underline} [to imagine that if the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates presses Ukraine to end
the war and [pursues a]{.underline} more **[pragmatic
relationship]{.underline}** [with Russia, Moscow's]{.underline}
cooperation with members of this **[axis]{.underline}** [could
lessen.]{.underline} Yet [this is **wishful thinking**]{.underline}. The
[growing ties]{.underline} among China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia
[are driven by incentives]{.underline} far [deeper than]{.underline} the
[transactional considerations]{.underline} created by the war in
Ukraine. If anything, **[[concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [made to
Russia]{.underline} to end the war would only
**[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [Kremlin's ability to]{.mark}
help its partners [weaken]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS

**[Russian ambitions]{.underline}** [may **not**]{.underline} [stop at
Ukraine]{.underline}, and [in the absence of Western action]{.underline}
today, the **[costs]{.underline}** [of resisting]{.underline} Russian
aggression will only [rise]{.underline}. [Russia is a **declining
power**]{.underline}, [but its potential]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[stir conflict]{.underline}** [remains]{.underline} significant. Thus,
the [burden of]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}** [and
**defense**]{.underline} against it [is **not**]{.underline} [going to
lighten]{.underline} in the near term. And because changes to defense
spending, procurement, and force posture require significant lead times,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [must]{.underline} think beyond
the current war in Ukraine and [start]{.underline} making
[investments]{.underline} now [to prevent]{.underline}
[Russian]{.underline} opportunistic **[aggression]{.underline}** later
on. Europe must channel its rising defense spending into expanding the
organizational capacity and logistical support necessary to make
independent action possible if the U.S. military is engaged elsewhere.
[Giving in to Russia's demands will not make it any easier]{.underline}
or cheaper [to defend Europe]{.underline}---just look at the events of
the past two decades. At every turn---the war in Georgia in 2008,
Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and its deployment of troops
to Syria in 2015---[Putin has grown]{.underline} only [more
**willing**]{.underline} [to take risks]{.underline} as he comes to
believe that doing so pays off.

Washington undoubtedly has competing priorities that will shift its
focus away from the Russian threat---China foremost among them. But
[to]{.underline} effectively [address China, Washington
must]{.underline} first [set European security on the right
path.]{.underline} The United States cannot simply hand off European
security to a Europe that is not yet capable of managing the Russian
threat. [If Washington downsized its]{.underline} [commitment to
Europe]{.underline} prematurely, [Moscow could take it as a sign of
growing U.]{.underline}S. **[disinterest]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} use the opportunity to [press ahead]{.underline}.

The prioritization of U.S. policies is important, but so is the
sequencing. The Trump administration will first have to manage the war
in Ukraine. Helping Ukraine achieve an end to the war on favorable terms
is the clearest way to reduce the threat of aggression from Russia and
the axis of upheaval that supports it. This agreement would need to be
embedded in a larger strategy to contain Russia and preserve Ukrainian
security. NATO should do away with the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act,
which prohibits permanent deployments of allied forces near Russia, and
station troops on NATO's eastern flank. The alliance should also raise
its members' defense spending targets, increase its readiness, and
improve its ability to deploy forces to defend threatened member states.
Western countries should maintain and better enforce sanctions and
export controls on Russia for at least as long as Putin remains in
power. Western countries must also invest in Ukraine's defense sector
and ensure that Ukraine can sustain its own armed forces to deter Russia
from invading again. Although these measures would not end the
confrontation with Russia, they would blunt Moscow's ambitions and its
capacity to both stir conflict in Europe and strengthen its partners in
other parts of the world.

The Trump administration must also preserve the United States' role as
the primary enabler of European security while working to reduce the
burden of its maintenance. European states must become more capable of
collective action that does not require U.S. aid. They may still rely on
the United States in some circumstances, but the extent of their
dependence can be significantly reduced. Over time, the United States
will become freer to focus on China as it shifts more defense
responsibilities to Europe. And in the meantime, it will avoid an overly
hasty, chaotic [pivot]{.underline} that [would]{.underline} only
encourage and **[embolden]{.underline}** [Moscow and could result in
Russia]{.underline} eventually [launching a]{.underline} **[reckless
war]{.underline}**, either [against]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
or once again against Ukraine.

There is no easy resolution to the West's confrontation with Russia.
[[Russian]{.underline} **[revisionism]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[aggression]{.underline}** [[are not going
away]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even if the current war in Ukraine is settled
via an armistice, without some kind of security guarantee for Ukraine,
another war is likely. [Ignoring Russia]{.underline} or assuming that it
can be easily managed as the United States turns its attention to China
[would]{.underline} only [allow the threat to grow. It would
be]{.underline} far [better for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies [to
take the challenge from Russia seriously]{.underline} today [than to let
another **conflict** become a more costly]{.underline} proposition
tomorrow.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} grievances [[lie behind]{.mark} Putin's
[**desire** to]{.mark}]{.underline} undermine Western democracies and
[[provoke **chaos** in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the US-led
**[Western]{.mark}** alliance **[system]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Putin believes Russia is at war with NATO in Ukraine and that victory is
of existential importance. Over the course of the war, [[Russia's
**need** for **weapons**]{.mark} and [**manpower**
drove]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**formation** of the [axis with
**No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [and **Iran**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Moscow received large shipments of important weapons and munitions from
both countries, and more than 10,000 North Korean troops are fighting
and dying to help retake Russian land in the Kursk region.

Early this year, both [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and Ukraine [[will
seek]{.underline}]{.mark} leverage in future talks and be more willing
to take risks. That means [[more]{.mark} intense **[missile]{.mark}**
and **[drone]{.mark}** strike**[s]{.mark}** on]{.underline} each other's
territory, heavy fighting at the front lines, [[and
**assassination**]{.mark} attempt**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} by both
sides targeting elites. The [[dynamic will be
**escalatory**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Against this backdrop, President-elect Donald Trump is likely to achieve
his long-sought ceasefire in the war later in 2025. He wants the
fighting stopped, regardless of EU efforts to assume more of the war's
costs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs a halt to the
fighting because Ukraine is slowly losing the war. Trump's pressure for
a ceasefire would ease the potential political fallout of the unpopular
move because Zelensky could argue that the US president forced him to
accept it. Meanwhile, Putin's army is advancing on the battlefield, and
he will be a harder sell on a ceasefire. But after 600,000 casualties
and three years of sanctions, Russia has its own looming manpower and
economic problems, and Putin will agree in part as an investment in his
relationship with Trump.

The ceasefire terms will freeze forces in place and leave Russia in de
facto control of conquered territory---a major concession to Russia. The
deal will at most "fudge" the issue of Ukraine's relationship with NATO
so that each side can claim a win, though reality will be clear:
Ukraine's membership can occur only in the distant future, if ever. But
while a halt to the fighting is likely, a peace agreement is not. Russia
will still want regime change in Kyiv and Ukraine to formally cede
territory. Ukraine will plan to live for another day when it can retake
territory. Both sides will rearm, and sporadic fighting will continue
along the line of control. The fragile ceasefire will probably continue
through this year, but not much longer.

The [ceasefire **risks** undermining]{.underline} the post-war [European
security architecture, [leaving]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**continent**
exposed to]{.mark} renewed **Russian [attacks]{.mark}**---[on Ukraine
and **beyond**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Nordics]{.underline}]{.mark},
the **[[Baltic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countrie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and Poland]{.mark} see Russia
as]{.underline} an [**existential** threat and will [use
all]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[resources]{.mark} they can to support a
**Ukrainian** military buildup]{.underline} during the ceasefire.
[[**France**, **Germany**, **Italy**, and others
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[follow]{.underline}]{.mark} the more
[hawkish [European]{.mark} countries'
**[lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}---supporting the deal while also seeking
to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and bolster Ukrainian and EU
defenses. All EU members and the UK are likely to hold off on
considering sanctions relief---in line with the likely US position,
tying the removal of restrictive measures to progress in peace talks.
The Europeans will also maintain the freeze on Russian assets, since the
ceasefire won't deal with reparations.

[Also **relevant** to Russian ambitions is Trump's **[transactional
approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward NATO, [which [will]{.mark}
weaken]{.underline} the [alliance and **[embolden
Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Trump will not attempt to withdraw
from NATO, the credibility of Article 5 security guarantees will depend
on individual countries' compliance with Trump's demands to increase
defense spending and reduce their bilateral trade surpluses with the US.
Trump will keep key military assets in Europe but will pull back US
troops from deployment rotations, including expensive ones in Eastern
Europe---exposing frontline countries.

In response, [[**Moscow** will continue]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**rogue policies** toward]{.mark} those countries in [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline} that directly oppose it. Before the ceasefire,
[[that means]{.underline}]{.mark} ongoing [[**efforts** to
**intimidate** EU]{.mark} countries]{.underline}. After the cessation of
the fighting, Russia will be in a somewhat stronger position relative to
both Ukraine and NATO---having achieved at least some of its territorial
goals. But [EU]{.underline} countries [and **Russia** will still pursue
**hostile** diplomatic and security policies]{.underline} toward one
another, knowing that a peace agreement is beyond reach and that the
ceasefire is tenuous and unlikely to last. The optics of US-Russia
policy will improve because of the Trump-Putin relationship, but little
else in the geopolitics will change.

As a result, throughout the year, [[Russia will **interfere**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [domestic politics of [countries it sees as
adversarial, pursuing]{.mark}]{.underline} tactics like those it used in
Romania last November, where it [deployed [**cyber** and
**other**]{.mark} tool**[s]{.mark}** to]{.underline} materially
[influence]{.underline} the outcome of a [presidential
**election**]{.underline}. In addition, Moscow will very likely target
undersea cables; for example, the Russian shadow fleet tanker Eagle S
may well have cut a cable off Finland in the Baltic Sea. Moscow will
continue attempts at arson and even assassination and meddle with GPS
systems at airports. Moreover, it will continue to use Telegram to
instill pro-Kremlin views in citizens of European countries and turn
them against their own governments.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said last December that Moscow was
"preparing for long-term confrontation with Ukraine and with us." No
other country in the world is doing more to directly subvert the global
order than Russia[. [In **2025**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, its [efforts
will **intensify**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Ukraine's Expense Will Not Bring Peace,"

[[Russia's]{.underline} **[strategic culture]{.underline}** [is composed
of]{.underline} **[authoritarian]{.underline}**]{.mark} [norms, beliefs,
and [values]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [underpinned by]{.underline}]{.mark}
historical resentment and **[[revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
views relations]{.underline}]{.mark} with other countries [[as
a]{.underline} **[zero-sum game]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in
which]{.underline} the [limits]{.underline} of what is permissible [are
[determined]{.mark}]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}**
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} (the balance of) [[power]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It would be true to say that there has never been a democracy in Russia.
The game of democracy (with its peculiarities) was necessary for Russian
leaders to convince Western countries that rapprochement with Russia was
not a threat. It is difficult to say whether perceptual blindness or a
choice in favor of [promising]{.underline} energy
[cooperation]{.underline} was more prevalent in Western countries'
assessments of Russia's behavior and intentions, but it [gave
[Moscow]{.mark} the opportunity to change]{.underline} the political
reality in [the]{.underline} European [security space]{.underline} step
by step, first [by]{.underline} **[[discrediting]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and reducing the authority of soft security
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the Council of Europe and
the OSCE and then by **[[violating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the principle
of [[territorial integrity and]{.underline}
**[unleashing]{.underline}**]{.mark} a full-scale
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Another prerequisite for the success of Russian foreign policy on the
European security direction is that Western countries preferred to adapt
to the new political and security environment created by Russia without
changing their approaches to security. The inertia of the defense policy
paradigms of some Western countries was stronger than the shock of
Russia's occupation and annexation of Crimea and even the outbreak of a
full-scale war in Europe.

Even today, NATO member states have different perceptions of the threats
posed by Russia, some of which do not consider its actions to be a
direct threat to their territorial integrity and security. This
differentiation in assessing threats and risks affects NATO's defense
capabilities and creates an atmosphere of uncertainty about the security
guarantees of NATO member states. After all, even the famous Article 5
of the treaty is limited in assisting the attacked Party by outlining
that NATO should take "such action as it deems necessary, including the
use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North
Atlantic area."

Despite statements by Western leaders about their strong intentions to
protect the security of the Euro-Atlantic area, the difference in
defense policy paradigms among NATO member states creates uncertainty
about what response NATO Allies would consider appropriate to an act of
aggression against one of them. It is also unclear whether protecting
the security of the Euro-Atlantic area includes protecting the
territorial integrity of NATO member states. Russia also does not know
this yet and wants to eliminate this uncertainty.

Of the four possible scenarios for stopping the war between Russia and
Ukraine analyzed by John Lough in the Chatham House Briefing Report,
three, the "Long War," the "Frozen Conflict," and the "Defeat for
Ukraine," are winning for Russia. The shock of Russia's actions has
already worn off, and people are getting used to the current political
reality. Since some NATO member states do not see the very existence of
the Russian political regime as a threat to them, they may look for ways
to return to full partnership with Russia and may likely discuss
Russia's conditions for creating a new buffer zone in Central and
Eastern Europe. At the same time, there should be no mistaking the
meaning of neutrality or a "buffer zone" of any kind between Russia and
the old NATO member states. Any buffer security space will be seen by
Russia as an opportunity to expand its zone of control.

Other NATO countries will look for additional opportunities to
strengthen their own security by concluding additional treaties, such as
the Trinity House Agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and
Germany. Differences in assessments of external threats among NATO
allies, coupled with a possible decline in US involvement in European
security, will create tensions within the Alliance and reduce the
already unclear level of joint commitments. In such circumstances,
Russia, together with its allies, may decide to launch a direct
aggression against a NATO member to confirm the inoperability of the
Euro-Atlantic security architecture and create a new political reality
in Europe on Russia's terms.

Conditions for Lasting Truce

Apparently, Putin believes that Russia is close to a strategic
breakthrough in the war with Ukraine and in its confrontation with the
West and, therefore, is not interested in ending the war. The model of
limited deterrence of Russia chosen by the West proved ineffective and
gave Russian authorities time to adapt to the new conditions.
Predictions of Russia's economic and technological collapse due to
limited sanction pressure proved irrelevant. The Russian economy has
adaprted, and it is now dependent on the war while simultaneously being
the basis for waging war. The war has also become a necessary condition
for the domestic political stability of the Russian regime.

[[Russia is waging a war of]{.underline}
**[attrition]{.underline}**]{.mark} in which cheap resources and cheap,
mass-produced technology are crucial. China's support is also an
important element of Russia's resilience. While formally remaining in
the shadows, China is supporting Russia politically, economically, and
technologically in the war against Ukraine (in fact, against the West)
and is studying the conventional experience of this war and the
possibilities of adapting to sanctions. The successes Russia is
achieving are beneficial to China. To a certain extent, Beijing views
Russia as a proxy in its rivalry with the United States because, in the
Sino-Russian tandem, Russia does all the "dirty work" and takes all the
risks in confronting the West.

[The]{.underline} [**[only way]{.underline}** [to stop
Russia]{.underline}'s]{.mark} war against Ukraine and achieve lasting
peace [[is]{.mark} to]{.underline} make this war unprofitable and
dangerous for the Russian political regime or to
[**[weaken]{.underline}** [Russia so]{.underline}]{.mark}
[much]{.underline} that [[it will be]{.underline}
**[unable]{.underline}** [to wage war]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[Kremlin will see]{.underline}]{.mark} all other
**[[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}** options [[as]{.mark} intermediate
[achievements]{.mark} in]{.underline} the war with the West
[[and]{.mark} will be [convert]{.mark}ed in[to]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the confrontation.

Today, it is hardly possible to talk about a lasting peace in the war
Russia is waging. The prospect of [**[peace]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}** [possible
if]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia]{.underline} itself
[undergoes]{.underline} internal [transformations]{.underline}. At the
same time, in the short term, states can discuss a lasting truce,
[provided that [the West]{.mark}]{.underline} **[abandons]{.underline}**
its comfortable [anti-escalation strategy and
[adopts]{.mark}]{.underline} a strategy of **[[forceful
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[depowering]{.underline}** [Russia]{.underline}.

Most discussions about how to stop this war center on the compromise
that Ukraine could make. Instead, the discussion should primarily be
about how to stop Russia. Western policy toward Russia today is aimed at
minimizing the risk of escalation. It is limited by the strategic
dilemma of "not letting Russia win, but not letting Russia fall" and
constrained by the narratives that Russians themselves spread. For
example, the [prospect of]{.underline} **[weakening]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[destabilizing]{.underline}** [Russia
has]{.underline} traditionally [been rejected]{.underline} by the West
[because of]{.underline} the [risks]{.underline} associated with nuclear
weapons. Thus, from the point of view of nuclear security, the stability
of the Russian authoritarian regime is considered beneficial and
necessary despite the destructive actions of this regime.
[Russia]{.underline}n authorities also skillfully [use]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-related [concerns to contain the
West]{.underline}, such as in its military support for Ukraine, and
promote the narrative that the West is to blame for the increased risks
of a nuclear confrontation.

Another narrative that narrows the West's policy options toward Russia
is spread by the so-called Russian opposition in exile and claims that
Russia can be transformed into a liberal democratic state while
maintaining its territorial integrity. At the same time, critics of this
idea say that because Russia is not a homogeneous nation-state,
successful liberalization will inevitably lead to the decolonization of
Russia---to its disintegration, which, as the experience of the collapse
of the Soviet Union shows, can have many stakeholders, be controlled,
and carry minimal risks. An argument in favor of the impossibility of
liberalizing Russia without a radical transformation is that Russian
society has no successful liberal democratic experience, and all
attempts at partial liberalization in Russia have led to a loss of
political control, protest movements, and, as a result, a return to
authoritarianism. Authoritarian Russia pursues an aggressive foreign
policy and launches wars as soon as it has sufficient resources to do
so. A weak Russia does not wage war.

At present, [[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} more effectively
[[using]{.mark} the [war]{.mark}]{.underline} with Ukraine
[[to]{.underline} **[destroy]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
Euro-Atlantic [[security architecture]{.underline}]{.mark} than the West
is using Ukraine to contain Russia. The Kremlin has enough resources to
wage war, both human and financial. A sociological study by the Center
for Analysis and Strategies in Europe shows that the Russian government
has enough human resources to fight a war for the next few years without
declaring mobilization. The analysis of the state and processes in the
Russian economy also demonstrates the ability to meet war needs for the
next few years. In a war of attrition, Ukraine is depleting faster than
Russia, but there is still time and opportunity to change the strategy
and stop Russia. To achieve, if not a lasting peace, then at least a
lasting truce, [[it is necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} not only to arm
Ukraine sufficiently and remove all political reservations on the use of
the provided weapons on Russian territory but also to [move [to]{.mark}
a policy of]{.underline} **[complete]{.underline}** economic
**[[isolat]{.mark}ion]{.underline}** [of [Russia]{.mark} by the
West]{.underline}, and most importantly, to stop the flow of oil and gas
revenues, which is the main resource for waging war and sustaining
Russian authoritarianism.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[shouldn't manage]{.mark} the [competition with China**; it should

up]{.mark} its [conventional forces]{.mark} faster than any country has
since World War II. These actions show that China isn't aiming for a
stalemate. Neither should America.]{.underline}

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are
violating.]{.underline} That means imposing costs on Chinese leader Xi
Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a [[cold war is
already being waged]{.mark} against the United States [by China's
leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a **[hot war]{.mark}**; they **[signal
complacency]{.mark}** to the American people and conciliation to Chinese
leaders]{.underline}. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will
not be won through half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires
openly admitting that [a **[totalitarian regime]{.mark}** that
**[commits genocide, fuels conflict]{.mark}**, and **[threatens
war]{.mark}** will never be a reliable partner.]{.underline} Like the
discredited détente policies that Washington adopted in the 1970s to
deal with the Soviet Union, the current approach will yield little
cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying their conviction that
they can destabilize the world with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[signed
a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline} In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a
redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. [[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the **[Russian war machine,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to
the U.S. State Department, [even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}

[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[, even [as those
regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war in
Europe.]{.underline} Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

[[Beijing is waging a bitter info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark} against
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---which is losing, despite
its natural advantages. [[Xi and]{.mark} his inner [circle see]{.mark}
themselves as **[fighting an existential]{.mark}** ideological
**[campaign]{.mark}** against the West,]{.underline} as [Xi's

Today's security landscape features the danger of direct military
conflict between great powers. [[China's]{.mark} territorial claims
[challenge]{.mark} U.S. allies from [Japan]{.mark} to the
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline} and other U.S. partners in the region,
such as [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Long-held U.S. interests such as freedom of navigation run into direct
conflict with China's maritime ambitions.]{.underline}

Then there is Taiwan. [[An attack on Taiwan would require]{.mark} a U.S.
military [response]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if the policy of
"strategic ambiguity" created uncertainty about the exact nature of it.
For years, the United States has acted as a kind of rheostat in the
Taiwan Strait, with the goal of preserving the status quo. Since 1979,
administrations from both parties have sold arms to Taiwan. President
Bill Clinton deployed the USS Independence to the strait in 1996 in
response to Beijing's aggressive activity. In 2003, the Bush
administration publicly chastised Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian
when he proposed a referendum that sounded very much like a vote on
independence. All along, the goal was to maintain---or occasionally,
restore---what had become a relatively stable status quo.

In recent years, [[Beijing's aggressive]{.mark} military
[activities]{.mark} around Taiwan have [challenged]{.mark} that
[equilibrium]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Washington, strategic ambiguity
has largely given way to open discussion of how to deter and, if
necessary, repel a Chinese invasion. But [[Beijing
could]{.underline}]{.mark} threaten Taiwan in other ways. It could
[[blockade]{.mark} the island, as [Chinese]{.mark} forces have
[practiced]{.mark} in [exercises]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Or it could
[seize]{.mark} small, uninhabited Taiwanese [islands, cut]{.mark}
underwater [cables]{.mark}, or launch large-scale
[cyberattacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} These strategies might be smarter
than a risky and difficult assault on Taiwan and would complicate a U.S.
response.

The overarching point is that [Beijing has Taiwan in its sights. Chinese
leader [Xi]{.mark} Jinping, who views the island as a rogue province,
[wants]{.mark} to complete the [restoration]{.mark} of China and take
his place in the pantheon of leaders next to Mao Zedong. [Hong Kong
is]{.mark} now effectively [a province]{.mark} of China]{.underline},
and bringing [Taiwan]{.underline} to heel would fulfill Xi's ambition.
That [[risks open conflict between U.S. and Chinese
forces.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Alarmingly, the United States and China still have none of the
deconfliction measures in place that the United States and Russia do.
During the 2008 war in Georgia, for instance, Michael Mullen, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had ongoing contact with his
Russian counterpart, Nikolai Makarov, so as to avoid an incident as the
U.S. Air Force flew Georgian troops home from Iraq to join the fight.
Compare that with 2001, when a hot-dogging Chinese pilot hit a U.S.
reconnaissance plane and forced it to the ground. The crew was detained
on Hainan Island, and for three days, Washington was unable to make
high-level contact with the Chinese leadership. I was national security
adviser at the time. Finally, I located my Chinese counterpart, who was
on a trip in Argentina, and got the Argentines to take a phone to him at
a barbecue. "Tell your leaders to take our call," I implored. Only then
were we able to defuse the crisis and free the crew. The reopening of
military-to-military contacts with China earlier this year, after a
four-year freeze, was a welcome development. But it is a far cry from
the types of procedures and lines of communication needed to prevent
accidental catastrophe.

[China's conventional [military modernization]{.mark} is impressive and
[accelerating]{.mark}. The country now has the [largest navy]{.mark} in
the world]{.underline}, with over 370 ships and submarines. [The
[growth]{.mark} in China's [nuclear arsenal]{.mark} is also
alarming.]{.underline} While the United States and the Soviet Union came
to a more or less common understanding of how to maintain the nuclear
equilibrium during the Cold War, that was a two-player game. [If China's
nuclear modernization continues, the world will face a more complicated,
multiplayer scenario---and without the safety net that Moscow and
Washington developed.]{.underline}

The potential for conflict comes against the backdrop of an arms race in
revolutionary technologies: [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence, [[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}
computing, [[syn]{.underline}]{.mark}thetic
[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logy, [[robotics]{.underline}]{.mark},
advances in [[space]{.underline}]{.mark}, and others. In 2017[, [Xi gave
a speech]{.mark} in which he [declared]{.mark} that [China would
surpass]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in these
frontier technologies [by 2035.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although he was
undoubtedly trying to rally China's scientists and engineers, it may be
a speech he has come to regret. Just as it was after the Soviet Union
launched the Sputnik satellite, the United States was forced to confront
the possibility that it could lose a technological race to its main
adversary---a realization that has spurred a concerted pushback from
Washington.

### AT: China Rise Inevitable

#### China rise not inevitable -- demographic inversion, education crackdowns, lack of FDI, youth unemployment. BUT the US needs to maintain pressure. 

**Rice '24** \[Condoleezza; August 20; Director of the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, PhD in Political Science at Josef
Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, MA

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/perils-isolationism-condoleezza-rice\]

China's future is by no means as bleak as Russia's. Yet
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[has]{.mark} internal
[contradictions]{.mark}. The country is experiencing a rapid
[demographic inversion]{.mark} rarely seen outside of war. Births have
declined by more than 50 percent since 2016, such that the total
fertility rate is approaching 1.0.]{.underline} The one-child policy,
put in place in 1979 and brutally enforced for decades, was the kind of
mistake that only an authoritarian regime could have made, and now,
millions of Chinese men don't have mates. Since the policy ended in
2016, the state has tried to browbeat women into having children,
turning women's rights into a crusade for childbearing---yet more
evidence of the panic in Beijing.

[Another contradiction stems from the uneasy coexistence of capitalism
and authoritarian communism]{.underline}. Xi has turned out to be a true
Marxist. [China's golden age of [private sector--led
growth]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has slowed]{.underline}]{.mark} in large
part [because of the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist
[P]{.underline}arty's [anxiety about alternative sources of power. China
[used to lead t]{.mark}he world [in]{.mark} online [education startups,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021, [the [government]{.mark} [cracked
down]{.mark} on them because it could not reliably monitor their
content.]{.underline} A once thriving [[entrepreneurial culture has
withered]{.mark} away.]{.underline} China's aggressive behavior toward
foreigners has exposed other contradictions. [Xi knows that [China needs
f]{.mark}oreign [d]{.mark}irect [i]{.mark}nvestment]{.underline}, and he
courts corporate leaders from across the world. [[But]{.mark} then, a
Western firm's offices are raided or one of its Chinese employees is
detained, and, not surprisingly, a [trust deficit grows]{.mark} between
Beijing and foreign investors.]{.underline}

China is also suffering a trust deficit with its youth. Young Chinese
citizens may be proud of their country, but a [[20 percent youth
unemployment]{.mark} rate has undermined their optimism for the
future.]{.underline} Xi's heavy-handed propagation of "Xi Jinping
Thought" turns them off. This has led them to adopt an attitude of what
is known colloquially as "lying flat," a passive-aggressive stance of
going along to get along while harboring no loyalty or enthusiasm for
the regime. Now is thus not the time to isolate Chinese youth but the
time to welcome them to study in the United States. As Nicholas Burns,
the U.S. ambassador to China, has noted, a regime that goes out of its
way to intimidate its citizens to discourage them from engaging with
Americans is not a confident regime. Indeed, it is a signal for the
United States to keep pushing for connections to the Chinese people.

Meanwhile, [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to maintain economic
[pressure on]{.mark} the revisionist powers. It should continue
[isolating Russia]{.mark}, with an eye toward arresting Beijing's
creeping support for the Kremlin.]{.underline} But it should refrain
from imposing blunt sanctions against China, since they would be
ineffective and counterproductive, crippling the U.S. economy in the
process. Targeted sanctions, by contrast, may [[slow Beijing's military
and tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[progress]{.underline}]{.mark},
at least for a while. Iran is much more vulnerable. Never again should
Washington unfreeze Iranian assets, as the Biden administration did as
part of a deal to release five imprisoned Americans. Efforts to find
moderates among Iran's theocrats are doomed to failure and serve only to
allow the mullahs to escape the contradictions of their unpopular,
aggressive, and incompetent regime.

Any good strategy starts with a clear goal in mind, and these three
visions of victory should inspire and inform U.S. strategy. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its allies
[[should]{.mark} work to [strengthen themselve]{.mark}s as well as
counter [and]{.mark} [weaken China]{.mark}]{.underline} (including by
working to loosen the CCP's grip on power) while simultaneously engaging
in tough-minded diplomacy to show China's leaders that there is a better
way forward if they are willing to end their hostile policies.

[[Some]{.mark} will [argue]{.mark} that a [tougher approach]{.mark} that
threatens the CCP will only [cause Beijing to become]{.mark} even more
[hostile, but]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact, [[China's]{.mark} current
[aggression]{.mark} has been [enabled by]{.mark} an [inconsistent
West]{.mark}ern approach that has failed to impose adequate costs on
Beijing for its malign behavior. A more [resolute
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} of confrontation [is [necessary]{.mark} now
[to bring]{.mark} about a l[ess threatening]{.mark} China in the
[future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Others might worry that the defeat of China's anti-American policies
would harm the well-being of the [Chinese people,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} of China's partners around the world,
[especially in the [global south]{.mark}. But on the contrary, these
populations would be among the [biggest beneficiaries of a]{.mark} new
[China that is less repressive]{.mark} at home and more cooperative
abroad.]{.underline}

It is hard to achieve success if you cannot envision it. With these
visions of victory clearly in mind, the United States and its allies
should finally set out to win, not just manage, the new cold war.

### AT: Imperialism K

#### Retrenchment causes authoritarian backsliding and makes global imperialism worse. Sweeping defense of "anti-imperialism" cause the US to turn inward and cedes control to revisionist powers.

The trouble with this new consensus, however, is that [Washington is not
operating in a vacuum.]{.underline} An undeviating policy of [U.S.
[restraint risks]{.mark} giving free rein to]{.underline} decidedly
**[regressive forces]{.underline}** in the world---[such as **[China's
authoritarian influence]{.mark}** across the global South, [Iran's
financing]{.mark} of [terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle East,
[and **[Russia's]{.mark}** war of **[aggression]{.mark}** against
Ukraine]{.underline}. Progressives are right to have a healthy
skepticism of using military force and coercive power. But the reality
today is that there are [authoritarian powers]{.underline} that are
[repressing]{.underline} their own [populations, bullying neighboring
states,]{.underline} and [[wielding economic]{.mark} influence and
[military force]{.mark} in]{.underline} other [ways that are
antithetical to progressive values. [If]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[retrenched]{.mark}, the [world would]{.mark} surely [see
**more**]{.mark} such behavior, not less.]{.underline}

Today's progressives need to get comfortable with [American
power]{.underline}, which, for all its flaws, [has a crucial role to
play.]{.underline} That doesn't mean condoning illiberal actions to
achieve just ends or cynically invoking progressive ideals to justify
military adventurism. [But it does mean seeking to harness power to
advance the values progressives cherish---and accepting that **[might
sometimes makes right.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

PILLARS OF PROGRESSIVISM

A progressive foreign policy shares some features with other approaches
but stands apart in key ways. [Liberal internationalism]{.underline}, a
foreign policy that aims to spread and protect liberal economic and
political values, [seeks [to]{.mark} promote democracy and [undermine
authoritarianism]{.mark}.]{.underline} So does conservative primacy,
which calls for the United States to maintain the preponderance of
global power. But compared with progressivism, these doctrines are more
optimistic about the ability of military force to achieve its goals, and
they are less committed to opposing imperialism and encouraging
self-determination.

[Progressive foreign policy also has some similarities to deep
engagement, an approach that demands the buildup of a [military]{.mark}
arsenal [sufficient to deter attacks]{.mark} against not only the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [but also its
allies.]{.underline} Proponents of both progressivism
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} deep engagement want Washington to [[work
with]{.mark} allies through multilateral [institutions]{.mark} such as
the UN.]{.underline} But progressives go further, championing
significant changes to these institutions, with an eye to making them
more equitable rather than necessarily U.S.-led. Progressives are also
more willing to hold back military aid from allies---as when the Biden
administration paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May
over growing concerns about the civilian death toll in Gaza.

On domestic policy, progressives mostly agree on specific priorities:
higher taxes for the rich, more spending on social programs, legal
protections for abortion, reforms to address the legacy of racism, and
so on. But there is far less consensus on foreign policy; instead, there
is a more general agreement on certain values that should inform U.S.
foreign policy.

The first is political and economic egalitarianism. This value can be
furthered through policies that promote equal political rights and
economic opportunities for women and other marginalized people, enforce
strong labor and environmental protections in trade agreements, and
condition military aid on human rights conditions. Just as progressives
support domestic policies that advance such goals at home, they champion
similar policies abroad. The platform of Democratic Senator Bernie
Sanders, for example, calls for "a foreign policy which focuses on
democracy, human rights, diplomacy and peace, and economic fairness."

The second principle fundamental to progressive thought is opposition to
needless war and excessive militarism, a tenet often described as
restraint. Progressives generally want Washington to avoid the use of
force and instead resolve disputes through talks. They are skeptical of
military alliances, which they argue can antagonize rivals and imperil
other states. "There are significant drawbacks to NATO's continuing
existence," the progressive historian Daniel Bessner has argued. "For
this reason, one of the major goals of the anti-imperialist left should
be to dismantle NATO." Some progressive advocates of restraint, such as
the economist Jeffrey Sachs and the historian Stephen Wertheim, view
NATO enlargement as one of the primary causes of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.

The third principle is anti-imperialism, which emerged as a pillar of
leftist and progressive thought in the late nineteenth century as a
reaction against European empire building. To be sure, not every
progressive saw colonialism as problematic---U.S. President Theodore
Roosevelt chief among them. But by the turn of the twentieth century,
many progressives had begun to criticize the colonial projects of
France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Later, as
anticolonial movements took root beginning in the postwar era, Western
anti-imperialist activists, including many in the civil rights movement
and the anti-apartheid movement, often supported independence struggles
by sending financial resources to national liberation movements and
publicizing their struggles.

Even today, Western commentators sometimes invoke anti-imperialism in
their calls for international solidarity, as when they argue in favor of
supporting Ukrainians' effort to resist Russia's imperialist aggression.
More often, however, [contemporary [anti-imperialism]{.mark} in the West
[is inwardly focused,]{.mark} [manifested in calls to combat Western
policies]{.mark} and practices that perpetuate systems of domination and
exploitation over poor countries]{.underline}. Progressives worry about
Western companies' behavior in the developing world, such as their use
of cheap labor, land expropriation, and environmental degradation. They
worry, too, about Western governments' imperialist treatment of other
countries, as with the imposition of "Washington consensus" economic
reforms in Latin America.

WHO'S TO BLAME?

For many progressives, these three principles are best pursued through a
foreign policy of retrenchment and restraint, since, in their view, it
is the United States that is to blame for much of what ails the world
today. The political scientist Van Jackson describes
"[[anti-hegemonism]{.mark}" as a branch of progressive grand strategy
that "[prioritizes restraining U.S. military]{.mark} and economic power
because it is the only adequate response to the perceived root cause of
global insecurity."]{.underline} Bessner would also like to see
Washington "restrain and reduce" its power. In this vision, the United
States would have fewer military bases, less influence on global
economic markets, and fewer and weaker military alliances. It would shy
away from getting involved in foreign crises, especially those requiring
military commitments, such as the war in Ukraine.

A United States like that, the logic goes, would no longer entangle
itself in conflicts akin to the "forever wars" that followed 9/11. By
shrinking its global military footprint, moreover, the country would not
be able to spread democracy at gunpoint or forcibly promote its
particular version of hard-edged capitalism, creating more space for
political and economic self-determination and progress toward political
and economic egalitarianism. And because the United States is an empire,
its pulling back would be anti-imperialist almost by definition.
Progressives [take it as a given that retrenchment would not undermine
their foreign policy goals.]{.underline}

UNRESOLVABLE TENSIONS

Progressive foreign policy principles---anti-militarism,
anti-imperialism, and egalitarianism---often conflict. Sometimes, the
pursuit of one undermines the others. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer
than in Ukraine. In October 2022, the Congressional Progressive Caucus
called on the Biden administration to negotiate with Russia to end the
war, only to drop the position under pressure from other Democrats who
concluded that opposition to imperialism should take precedence over
opposition to war. Not all progressives agreed with the caucus's
about-face. The historian Samuel Moyn has described support for Ukraine
as an aspect of "the militarization of the globe under U.S. auspices."
Days after the invasion, the Democratic Socialists of America, the
country's largest socialist organization, called on the United States
"to withdraw from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set
the stage for this conflict." [But if [Washington discontinued]{.mark}
its military [support for Ukraine, progressive aims]{.mark} and values
[in Europe]{.mark} and beyond [would]{.mark} almost certainly [be set
back.]{.mark} A strict [antimilitarist policy would not]{.mark}
[serve]{.mark} the cause of [Ukrainian]{.mark} liberals, [who]{.mark}
would [face]{.mark} a direct threat of repression, detention, or even
[death]{.mark} under Moscow's ruthless rule.]{.underline}

[Retrenchment cannot resolve this tension between]{.underline}, on the
one hand, opposing war and, on the other, [defending egalitarianism and
resisting imperialism]{.underline}. In fact, [[abandoning]{.mark}
Ukraine wouldn't necessarily result in less war; it [could]{.mark} very
well [embolden]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark} to intensify his efforts to subjugate the Ukrainian
people.]{.underline} And even if reducing military aid to Ukraine
hastened a formal end to the war through peace negotiations, as some
progressives hope, [[violence against]{.mark} Ukrainian
[civilians]{.mark} by Russian forces in occupied territories would
probably continue apace. It [might]{.mark} even
[escalate.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A similar tension arises in [Syria]{.mark} policy]{.underline}. Some
[[progressive]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats in the House of
Representatives, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Becca Balint,
[[have joined isolationist Republicans]{.mark} in calling on Washington
to bring home the 900 U.S. troops still deployed in Syria.]{.underline}
These troops work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces, a
predominantly Kurdish alliance of rebel groups opposed to the regime of
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping combat the remnants of the
Islamic State, or ISIS. The SDF was a crucial ally in the U.S.-led
coalition to defeat ISIS; it governs part of northeast Syria as a de
facto state with a constitution-like charter that reflects a commitment
to democracy, human rights, and gender equality.

[The presence of U.S. [troops]{.mark} is [crucial to]{.mark} the SDF's
efforts to [maintain security]{.mark} in northeast Syria, and the [SDF
has]{.mark} in fact repeatedly expressed [concerns]{.mark} that an
American [withdrawal would be **catastrophic.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [By
dialing back its modest support of the relatively progressive SDF, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would [enable Iran, Russia,
and ISIS to expand]{.mark} their influence in Syria and foil one of the
region's few democratic independence movements. A complete withdrawal
from Syria would be even worse, [creating a]{.mark} security
[vacuum]{.mark} in which these forces could [pursue]{.mark} their
[violent]{.mark}, antidemocratic [agendas]{.mark}. The [same]{.mark}
goes [for Iraq,]{.mark}]{.underline} which still hosts 2,500 U.S.
troops.

Some progressives have decried military intervention as a thinly veiled
imperialist tool. In a 2020 interview, Matt Duss, then a foreign policy
adviser to Sanders, described U.S. forces around the world as part of an
"empire that we have created." In many cases, such as the U.S.
interventions in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011, these arguments have
proved to be well founded. But in some instances, [[military]{.mark}
action has [saved many lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} The British military
[intervention in [Sierra Leone]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2000, for
example, [was essential to sustaining UN [peacekeeping]{.mark} forces
there, [end]{.mark}ing [the war,]{.mark} and fostering a peace that has
lasted for more than 20 years.]{.underline}

Outside of war, [retrenchment can similarly undermine progressive goals.
Consider the extensive role Washington played in preventing a coup in
[Brazil]{.mark}.]{.underline} From 2021 to 2022, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [worked with Luiz Inácio
Lula da Silva, the democratically elected president of Brazil, to
[prevent]{.mark} supporters of the defeated incumbent, Jair [Bolsonaro,
from]{.mark} illegally [seizing power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[The administration publicly supported Lula's victory, encouraged U.S.
allies to take the same position, and communicated to the Brazilian
military that a coup would leave the country isolated and result in a
downgrading of U.S. security cooperation.]{.underline} The result:
[[violence was avoided]{.mark}, and a]{.underline} popularly elected,
[politically progressive president survived an antidemocratic challenge
from his authoritarian rival.]{.underline} Washington has been complicit
in a long history of abuses in South America. But on this occasion, it
used its diplomatic influence to preserve democratic institutions. [Had
the United States instead stayed out of the dispute, Brazil would
probably have ended up with more violence and less
democracy.]{.underline}

[[Retrenchment from global markets]{.mark}, such as withdrawing from
[trade]{.mark} agreements or international economic
[institutions]{.mark}, can likewise [create vacuums]{.mark} for bad
actors to exploit. Consider the vacuum left behind by the failure of the
T]{.underline}rans-[P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}artnership, the
trade deal proposed by the Obama administration that would have
strengthened economic ties between the United States and 11 other
economies. When U.S. President Donald Trump killed the TPP in 2017,
progressives such as Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and
Representative Keith Ellison applauded. Progressives can debate what
effect the TPP would have had on American jobs, and they can argue that
the proposed agreement did not go far enough to uphold human rights and
environmental or labor standards abroad. But the TPP's failure did not
ameliorate such abuses; it exacerbated them. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [trading [partners]{.mark} went on to
[look]{.mark} elsewhere for international economic leadership, and they
found it [in China.]{.mark} In 2020, 15 countries, including China,
signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,
[creating]{.mark} the largest [economic bloc in]{.mark} history in a
deal [that includes none of the labor]{.mark}, human [rights, or]{.mark}
[environmental protections]{.mark} envisioned in the TPP.]{.underline}
The interests of American workers should always be considered, but
progressive advocates of protectionism must also grapple with how their
policies affect workers in developing countries.

Progressives who push for restraint and retrenchment generally have
little to say about how the United States should address its own
security threats. Some advocates of restraint argue for "offshore
balancing," whereby Washington pulls back and relies instead on regional
allies to keep challengers in check. Although this approach would reduce
the direct role of the U.S. military in international conflicts, it
still allows for the United States to exercise its influence in proxy
wars that can be just as inimical to peace and security, if not more so.
Today, autocratic countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia benefit from
U.S. arms sales, joint military training exercises, and other security
cooperation. Doling out military aid may keep U.S. troops out of harm's
way, but it does not necessarily reduce armed conflict. Often, it merely
renders the United States complicit in violations of human rights and
the laws of war, as in Israel's war in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's war in
Yemen.

Progressives' mistrust of U.S. foreign policy and intervention is
understandable, given Washington's long history of harmful military,
political, and economic interference abroad. American power has often
hindered progressive aims. But it has sometimes advanced them. [A
[rigid]{.mark} commitment to [restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}, no matter
the circumstances and whatever the cost, [[is]{.mark} the stuff of
**[ideological zealotry]{.mark}**, not judicious
policymaking.]{.underline}

A FORCE FOR GOOD

Progressives are rightly skeptical about the ability of military force
to achieve political goals. [But there are scenarios in which the use of
[force aligns with]{.mark} progressive principles: military support for
[anti-imperialist efforts]{.mark}, limited [humanitarian
interventions,]{.mark} and [defensive wars]{.mark} of necessity.
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} should rarely resort to military
solutions to international problems, but it [[must retain]{.mark} the
[capacity]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}---[to wield
force]{.mark} or support its use by others in ways that align with
progressive principles.]{.underline}

[Military, economic, and humanitarian [support]{.mark} to
[anti-imperialist combatants]{.mark} is consistent with progressive
principles]{.underline}, as long as the recipients comply with
international humanitarian law and norms regarding the use of force.
Countries with long traditions of progressivism have historically
supported anti-imperialist actions around the world; Sweden, for
example, supplied humanitarian aid to national liberation movements in
Mozambique and Guinea Bissau in the 1960s and 1970s.

Even direct military involvement can be consistent with progressive
values. Many humanitarian interventions have intensified violence and
prolonged wars---as in Libya, where the NATO coalition overstepped its
narrow mandate of protecting civilians and ended up facilitating regime
change. But there are notable exceptions, such as when the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and its
coalition partners [expelled Iraqi]{.mark}]{.underline} [[forces from
Kuwait]{.mark} in the Gulf War]{.underline}. There have also been
[[**countless humanitarian crises**, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[Rwanda]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1994, in
[[Srebrenica]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1995, and in [[Sri
Lanka]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2009, in [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the
United States failed to intervene---and in which [[even a modest]{.mark}
military [intervention would]{.mark} likely [have reduced]{.mark} human
[suffering]{.mark} without exacerbating violence.]{.underline} The
political scientist Alan Kuperman has estimated that a "minimum
intervention" to stop the Rwandan genocide could have saved about 75,000
lives.

Finally, [wars for defensive purposes]{.underline}, whether in defense
of the United States or U.S. allies, are generally consistent with
progressive values, so long as they are fought in ways that align with
international humanitarian law and the laws of war. No mainstream
progressive has called for surrendering the country's right to national
self-defense. But many of them advocate [[policies]{.mark} that [could
gut]{.mark} the United States' [defensive capabilities]{.mark},
capabilities [that deter aggression]{.mark} by making war less desirable
for would-be aggressors.]{.underline} For this reason, although
progressives are right to call for cuts to the U.S. defense
budget---which, at nearly \$900 billion a year, remains the world's
largest---a [progressive national security policy must prioritize the
maintenance of an adequate defense base.]{.underline}

\*STWM = Steps to War Model

Our **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [applied]{.underline} the
three [**main** indicators of **STWM**]{.underline} to the Arctic region
with regard to the Arctic Council states in the period [since
**2014**]{.underline}. We have sought to [answer whether]{.underline}
the [conflict]{.underline} potential has been [trending
upwards]{.underline} since 2014 and how close it is to a critical
threshold based on recent developments. The [outcomes [show **clear**
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} confirming [rising **confrontational**
behaviour]{.underline} in the militarisation marker. On the other hand,
the rivalry indicator shows [continued [**cooperative**
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}, while the coalition-building analysis
also [shows a **mostly** cooperative approach]{.underline} in the
post-Crimea period, then a sharp decline after February 2022.

Thus, the STWM, as one of the most sensitive models of escalation
potential of territorial disputes, confirms confrontational behaviour in
two indicators, militarisation and coalition-building. The latter,
however, changed dramatically after February 2022. Regional Arctic
coalitions have suspended most forms of cooperation with Russia, and two
of the regional actors, Finland and Sweden, applied for NATO membership
in May 2022 with Finland joining in April 2023 and Sweden's membership
awaiting Turkish ratification as of November 2023. Since all three
indicators of the STWM must show the relevant trends in order to signal
increased likelihood of international armed conflict, [in the case
of]{.underline} the **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such
[[conflict]{.mark} is **[not predicted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Thus, while the research clearly shows a [rise in conflict
**potential**]{.underline}, critically, the [[**rivalry**
factor]{.underline}]{.mark} has **[[not
increased]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, [**[no]{.mark}ne** of
the [actor]{.mark}s]{.underline} in the examined region [[has]{.mark} an
[**interest** in **escalating**]{.mark} confrontational
behaviour]{.underline}. While the [[military]{.underline}]{.mark}
presence is growing in the Arctic, this [[growth]{.mark} has **[not
diverged]{.mark}** drastically [from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**previous** trend]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even on the worsened
geopolitical playing field after February 2022,
[**[communication]{.mark}** channels]{.underline} have
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been [[interrupted]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
the rivalry [indicators clearly show **cooperative
behaviour**]{.underline} among the actors, [including]{.underline}
indications of [efforts to **continue**]{.underline} in this manner.

Since 2014, [defence spending]{.underline} has [risen]{.underline}.
There have been frequent rhetorical confrontations, and the undisputable
military build-up by Russia and the other Arctic states has increased.
Overall, international tensions have risen. [Nevertheless]{.underline},
the [actors in]{.underline} the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[show]{.mark}n **[stability]{.mark}** and [**adherence**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the regime of [regional cooperation
**institutions** and **[treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the other
hand, one might argue that increased militarisation, which takes the
most time of all factors and requires the most investment to change, may
indicate that the other factors in STWM could also change easily and
quickly. This is confirmed by a rapid change in coalition-building after
February 2022. However, the [evidence]{.underline} so far
[leaves]{.underline} the **[non-escalating]{.underline}** rivalry
[factor as]{.underline} a [**highly relevant** counterbalance to
increased militarisation]{.underline} and negative trends in
coalition-building. In short, the [rivalry factor]{.underline} is
[[**strong enough** to **offset**]{.underline}]{.mark} and even detract
from the [[tensions]{.mark} caused by developments [in
**militarisation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and coalition-building.

Placing this research within a larger international context, the
[prioritisation of]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} among the key
players [has decreased]{.underline} at the expense of developments in
Eastern Europe and the world energy crisis. The enduring world economic
crisis in the wake of the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic
[and]{.underline} the invasion of [[**Ukraine**
reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[desire for]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**escalation** of another **[conflict]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**. It is thus [expected that]{.underline} the
[[**Arctic** countries]{.underline}]{.mark} will [adhere to
**non-confrontational** behaviour]{.underline}. It is also questionable
whether these countries can sustain their planned Arctic-specific
military spending under the current economic situation and more pressing
issues elsewhere on the international scene. Hence, all these phenomena
further support the idea that the [rivalry factor]{.underline} will
[continue to [support **non-escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
region.

The evidence also reveals Russian activities as the catalyst of recent
military developments, and that confrontational behaviour in the
military dimension pits Russia against the other seven Arctic countries.
In this regard, further research as to if and under what conditions the
Arctic could be a future sphere of new Russian military activities would
be valuable. Russian interests in the Arctic, its military developments
after 2014, and the actual reasons for these activities are key topics
for further debate. Yet, [despite]{.underline} the clearly
[**increased** tensions]{.underline} between Russia and the West [since
**2014**, we]{.underline} have [see]{.underline}n [[**persistent**
rhetoric underlining **coop**]{.mark}**eration** and **joint** dispute
**settlement**]{.underline} in the High North [and agendas setting
**cooperative goals**]{.underline} for respective coalitions. Thus, the
coalition regime under which cooperation in the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** takes place [appears
**[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the time being.

[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[submit]{.mark} these [**claims**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the UN CLCS. The
majority of existing [territorial **[disputes]{.mark}**
have]{.underline} thus far [[been resolved **peacefully**]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, at least [for the foreseeable **future**, the
**remaining [unresolved]{.mark}** [disputes]{.mark} are **highly
[unlikely]{.mark}** [to lead to]{.mark} international **armed
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Rainwater
2015; Olesen 2017). After all, [[**stability** and
**coop**]{.mark}eration are [needed for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[econ]{.mark}**omic **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Arctic. In addition, [most of the **natural
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including offshore energy) [are
[located in **uncontested** areas]{.mark}]{.underline} (Byers 2013;
Olesen 2017). [Rather than]{.underline} ([military]{.underline})

[**institutional** and **legal framework**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
may at times be coloured by competition among some Arctic states
(Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Olesen 2017).

In conclusion, [the evidence shows that the **Arctic-8** continue to
behave]{.underline} mostly [in a **coop**erative **manner**, without
increasing rivalry]{.underline}. While this trend did not change after
the illegal annexation of Crimea, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
certain tensions with regard to the Arctic can be observed. Overall,
however, [**[disputes]{.mark}** in the region have, thus far, been
**[dealt]{.mark}** with [in]{.mark} a [**peaceful**, **diplomatic** and
**multilateral** way]{.mark}. The **[Arctic-8]{.mark}** have [**agreed**
to **follow**]{.mark} the rules laid down in]{.underline} the
**[[UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other [regional [**treaties** and
**custom**]{.mark}ary rules of **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}.
Based on this, we can expect that [the **coop**erative **approach** to

But Østhagen believes [there are three [**major misconceptions**
about]{.mark} geopolitics in the **Arctic**]{.underline}:

The first is the [**[possibility of war]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The second is that there are [[**unresolved**
borders]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic [and that a **[resource
race]{.mark}** is underway]{.underline}. The third is that
[**[climate]{.mark}** change is the primary
**[catalyst]{.mark}**]{.underline} for all changes in the Arctic region.

"[The [**reality** is much calmer]{.mark}]{.underline}," Østhagen says.

"The Electron case illustrates well everything that can go wrong. But it
also shows [why [things]{.mark} usually [**dont** go wrong]{.mark}.
There\'s a **[willingness to cooperate]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Svein
Vigeland Rottem says.

He is a senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the Arctic.

Rottem and Østhagen [[do not agree]{.mark} that the [Arctic is a
**powder keg**]{.mark}]{.underline} and a dangerous place, as recently
stated by Lars Saunes, former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian
Broadcasting Corporation NRK.

Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic

Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions]{.mark} in the Arctic are often **[more
stable]{.mark}** and transparent [than many
**assume**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Conflict]{.mark} is [**not easily** triggered]{.mark}, considering the
[**vast** areas and]{.mark} **diverse** [countries]{.mark}
involved]{.underline}. Østhagen emphasises the enormity of the Arctic,
which encompasses eight countries, four million people, and extensive
ocean areas. The countries include Russia, the Nordic states, the USA,
and Canada.

He notes that the significant Russian presence -- with almost half of
the Arctic landmass under Russian control -- influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North.

Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at the FNI, concurs
that [the [Arctic]{.mark} is [**less likely** to witness]{.mark} armed
[**conflict** than other]{.mark} global locations]{.underline}.

He believes the primary driver for military conflict in the Arctic is
Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base for nuclear weapons.

"There are three main ways to keep such weapons mobile: in aircraft, on
land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where such submarines exist, as
in Murmansk, there is also significant military attention. And where
there is military attention, there is also the potential for conflict,"
he says.

Neumann advises caution in responding to Russia\'s desire for global
attention and military control, stressing the importance of Norway
maintaining a cool head, enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to
intimidation.

Myth 2: Unresolved borders and a race for resources

As the Arctic becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of
climate change, [a **common myth** suggests a scramble for resources and
land]{.underline} in the North will occur.

But Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other parts of the world, [[there
are]{.mark} almost [**no disputes** over]{.mark} Arctic
[borders]{.mark}]{.underline}.

["All the borders are **settled**]{.underline}," he says, noting that
[the **last** conflict]{.underline} between Canada and Greenland [was
resolved in 20**22**]{.underline}.

Maritime boundaries are key for resource management and potential
conflict. Law of the sea grants coastal states sovereign rights for
resource exploitation in their economic zones.

In the Arctic, only one maritime boundary remains unresolve. It is
between the USA and Canada -- two close allies.

Østhagen, who wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, [[foresees
**no**]{.mark} **major** [concerns regarding **sovereignty**]{.mark} or
territorial issues]{.underline}. He believes the [myth persists due to
**historical** reasons but]{.underline} emphasises that, [with all the
land borders **settled** and just **one** disputed sea border, Arctic
[resources]{.mark} are **[already distributed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
among the eight Arctic states.

Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the Arctic

A third [[myth suggests]{.mark} that **[climate]{.mark}** change is the
**[main driver]{.mark}**]{.underline} for all political shifts in the
Arctic.

But Østhagen [[cautions against **oversimplifying**]{.mark} the
issue]{.underline}, noting that while climate change does affect fish
migration -- leading to potential future conflicts around resource-rich
areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to be specific about which
aspects of climate change increase conflict risks.

### Icebreakers \-\-- 1NC

#### The icebreaker gap is overblown, they're useless and not important for deterring Russia or China.

However, [using relative [icebreaker]{.mark} fleet sizes [as]{.mark} a
key [metric]{.mark} for]{.underline} the state of [strategic competition
in the Arctic [is **flawed**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While they are an
important platform, [icebreakers [do **little** to]{.mark} create or
[address]{.mark} the most commonly identified defense
[challenges]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline} Instead, analysts should
focus on the nature of the military risks in the Arctic, the role of
allies and partners, and economic interests in a broader geopolitical
context rather than comparing specific capabilities. Doing so is
important to avoid mischaracterizing the scope of the danger or
emphasizing the wrong types of solutions.

The Icebreaker Fleets

If relative icebreaker counts are the right way to measure competition
in the Arctic, then the United States is in trouble. Russia possesses
more than 40 icebreakers and plans to build more, with a goal of 13
heavy-duty icebreakers in operation by 2035. China recently acquired its
second, and first domestically built, icebreaker and has aspirations for
a nuclear-powered variant. By contrast, the United States has one aged
heavy icebreaker and one medium version in operation. While there are
plans to build six more (including three heavy icebreakers at an
estimated total cost of \$2.6--2.95 billion), funding is largely limited
to the first one and it will not be available until 2023 or 2024. Unlike
past fears that the United States was on the wrong side of a bomber gap,
missile gap, or the dreaded mine-shaft gap, an icebreaker gap does
indeed exist.

Most analysts who warn about the gap distinguish the Coast Guard's role
--- which operates U.S. icebreakers and is part of the Department of
Homeland Security in peacetime ---from the Department of Defense mission
set. Yet placing the icebreaker discussion alongside threats from Russia
and China makes an implicit or explicit connection between icebreakers
and U.S. military vulnerability.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

Thankfully for Washington, [the [consequences]{.mark} of this icebreaker
gap for U.S. defense [are]{.mark} often misunderstood or
**[overstated.]{.mark}**]{.underline} First, many of the specific
[[military challenges t]{.mark}hat China or Russia might pose in the
Arctic [are **independent**]{.mark} of icebreakers and best dealt with
in other ways.]{.underline} These [include]{.underline} [denying the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [access]{.underline} to the
region, [missile strikes]{.underline} against the homeland, the [ability
to move forces]{.underline} from the homeland, and demonstrating U.S.
strength against challenges.

[It is [not clear how Russia or China would leverage icebreakers]{.mark}
to exclude the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [from the
region,]{.underline} or how the United States would utilize icebreakers
to overcome such attempts. Take the concern of [Russia [denying]{.mark}
access along the [N]{.mark}]{.underline}orthern
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}oute (setting aside
the limited trans-Arctic shipping to date and modest future
projections). [The Russian ability to do this [stems]{.mark} primarily
[from]{.mark} their growing [missile, air, and surveillance]{.mark}
capabilities deployed within their own territory.]{.underline} As
Mathieu Boulègue observes, the [Russian Northern
[Fleet]{.mark}]{.underline} will likely be able to perform some sea
denial missions "at a limited operational tempo." Yet ["the majority of
its [assets are **not** Arctic-specific]{.mark}]{.underline}, operating
beyond the region and in other strategic directions." [Increasing the
numbers of U.S. [icebreakers would not overcome]{.mark} the Russian
shore-based [area-denial]{.mark} challenge]{.underline}. In the event of
a crisis, [naval surface [vessels]{.mark} operating [behind]{.mark}
slow-moving [icebreakers would be]{.mark}]{.underline}, Andreas Kuersten
notes, ["**[sitting ducks]{.mark}** for aerial, undersea, and
shore-based enemy forces."]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers]{.mark} would play a **[marginal]{.mark}** role in
countering other military challenges to the United States emerging from
the region.]{.underline} Missiles fired from the Russian Arctic toward
the United States would traverse over the Arctic. The status of what the
DoD terms the "aging North Warning System" is a greater concern from
this perspective than a lack of icebreakers. Similarly, while Russia's
icebreakers are important for its Northern Fleet's ability to operate in
and through the Arctic, the number of U.S. icebreakers has little
bearing on this. Addressing Russia's ability to project power into the
North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic strategy focuses on other capabilities.
These include cooperation with Great Britain and Norway on P-8 patrols,
NATO air policing missions from Iceland, and a recognition that
establishment of Joint Force Command Norfolk helps to protect the North
Atlantic sea lines of communication to Europe.

[[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} remain a perennial problem, but
their [strategic [value is **little affected** by]{.mark} the relative
number of [icebreakers]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2019 DoD annual report
on [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} worries that Chinese civilian research
--- presumably some of which would be undertaken by icebreakers ---
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} support efforts to
[[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[submarines]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks." Turning to
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the bulk of its naval [nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} capability [[is]{.mark} based [in]{.mark} the
[Kola]{.mark} Peninsula.]{.underline} Much of [[Russia's]{.mark}
military [activity]{.mark} in the Arctic [is dedicated to defending this
capability]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Austin Long and Brendan Green show,
during the Cold War the United States relied on a combination of
sensors, information processing, submarines, and other anti-submarine
warfare assets to track Soviet nuclear-powered submarines armed with
ballistic missiles (SSBNs). To be sure, technology has not stood still.
Yet tracking Russian and Chinese SSBNs in or in transit to the Arctic
today would involve a variety of U.S. capabilities beyond or already
with access to the Arctic. If anything, diminishing sea ice might
undermine the ability of SSBNs to remain hidden. More generally, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} has [relied on]{.mark} its **[nuclear arsenal]{.mark}** for
decades [to deter]{.mark} nuclear threats. [It is **unclear**
why]{.mark} Russia or China possessing more [icebreakers would undermine

[Others]{.underline} have [argued that U.S. icebreakers are necessary to
signal resolve.]{.underline} For instance, Sabrina Shankman reports that
more than a dozen polar and military experts concluded that "if a rival
state decided to encroach on the U.S. exclusive economic zone . . . or
step up a military show of force," then the "presence --- or absence ---
of an icebreaker could . . . be a telling message of strength or
weakness." Presumably, though, [a [U.S. ability to respond with]{.mark}
more lethal [subsurface or aerial assets]{.mark} [would constitute
a]{.mark} telling [message.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, the [[implications of]{.mark} relative numbers of [icebreakers
look different when considering]{.mark} the **[vastly]{.mark}**
[different]{.mark} Arctic **[contexts]{.mark}**, particularly for the
United States and Russia.]{.underline} According to the Arctic
Institute, Russia has roughly 24,140 kilometers of coastline and two
million inhabitants in the Arctic. The Economist highlighted that, all
told, [[Russia has]{.mark} "at least [half of the Arctic]{.mark} in
terms of area, coastline, population and probably mineral wealth." The
Russian economy depends heavily on oil and natural gas, including from
the Arctic, for its federal budget and exports.]{.underline} As noted, a
sizeable portion of Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent is based in the
Arctic. [Russian interests dictate a large number of
icebreakers.]{.underline} By comparison, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline} roughly 4,057 kilometers ([2,521
miles) of [Arctic]{.mark} shoreline]{.underline} and approximately
[68,000 people]{.underline} living in the Alaskan Arctic. [Oil and gas
extraction]{.underline}, even when including the non-Artic portion,
[[makes up]{.mark} a very [**small percentage** of]{.mark} the [U.S.
economy.]{.mark} The U.S. nuclear [triad is **not dependent**]{.mark}
upon basing or SSBN patrols in the Arctic.]{.underline}

A third problem with [[focusing]{.underline}]{.mark} solely [[on]{.mark}
counts of [U.S]{.mark}. capabilities]{.underline} is that it
[**[ignores]{.mark}** the role of U.S. [allies]{.mark} and partners.
[Seven of the eight Arctic nations are]{.mark} either [NATO]{.mark}
allies or NATO enhanced opportunities partners]{.underline} (six of
which have some icebreaking capacity). [[Non-Arctic
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the United Kingdom, [[have]{.mark}
interests and [assets]{.mark} relevant to the region [as
well.]{.mark}]{.underline} These states' capabilities and geographic
locations shape the Arctic security environment. For example, Canada
currently operates two heavy and four medium icebreakers and the
Norwegian Armed Forces' Joint Headquarters is located in the Arctic.
Rebecca Pincus explains how, "carefully calibrated," [[the]{.mark}
"NATO-Russia [Council]{.mark} could be a [useful]{.mark} forum [for
dialogue on security]{.mark} topics in the Arctic."]{.underline} The
contribution of specific allies and partners will no doubt be more
relevant to some problems than others. Even if they are not able to
directly contribute to a particular issue, [[allies]{.mark} and partners
can [free up]{.mark} U.S. time and [resources]{.mark} to focus
elsewhere. They can also help [improve]{.mark} situational
[awareness]{.mark} and [manage tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} more
broadly to minimize dangers and create opportunities in and near the
North American and European Arctic.

#### They're not key to resource access.

Finally, [[icebreakers **do not** give states the ability to claim
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} that will become available as climate
change leads to less ice coverage[. "Most Arctic [territory]{.mark} and
resources are [solidly within]{.mark} the [jurisdictions of Arctic
states]{.mark},"]{.underline} writes Kuersten. [[This is **not** the
19th century]{.mark}, when prospectors or military forces could stake
claims to new territory]{.underline}. For example, Douglas Porch
recounts how preoccupation with "effective occupation" led French
military forces in Africa to sacrifice basic prudence in a "desire to
steal a march on international competition." There should be no rush ---
and is no need --- to repeat these mistakes. Indeed, the [Pentagon's
recent Arctic strategy notes that [even "Russia has]{.mark} generally
[followed international law]{.mark} and procedure in establishing the
limits of its extended continental shelf."]{.underline}

To be sure, icebreakers are necessary to access polar areas even as ice
cover diminishes. They are an important element of Arctic sovereignty as
a result. However, [[the numbe]{.mark}r that [other countries
possess]{.mark} [does not affect]{.mark} the number that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [requires to
provide access to its exclusive economic zone. [It is]{.mark} also
[unlikely]{.mark} that [a country would use icebreakers to stake a
claim]{.mark} to the U.S. Arctic.]{.underline} If it did, capabilities
other than icebreakers would be better suited to dislodging them should
diplomacy fail.

#### Centralizing icebreakers [trades off]{.underline} with [more effective]{.underline} deterrence and [flips]{.underline} militarization.

The best way to deal with China and Russia in the Arctic is to address
disputes in their own backyards. Most of the pathways to a great-power
crisis that could end up affecting the Arctic stem from crises outside
the region. Engaging Russia and China elsewhere rather than focusing on
specific capabilities in the Arctic, including icebreakers, will thus
have salutary effects. The nominal Defense Department approach is to
enhance a combat-credible forward presence in Eastern Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. By deterring a conflict there, the logic goes, the Arctic
is less likely to suffer negative "strategic spillover." [A
[**fixation** with]{.mark} the number of
[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, or ice-hardened vessels more
generally, [as part of competing with Russia or China in the Arctic [can
lead to **unnecessary** investments and **divert** military
assets]{.mark} better utilized elsewhere.]{.underline} Alternative
approaches might focus on some form of grand bargain or a more
restrained U.S. foreign policy to alleviate tensions. The hope of this
approach is that it might broadly reduce competition. That would then
also have benefits for the Arctic.

Local defense challenges in the Arctic will remain, of course. Those
should be addressed using political and economic diplomacy and refining
military concepts and capabilities as necessary. [[Resisting]{.mark} the
temptation to engage in numerical comparisons of [icebreakers]{.mark}
will [help avoid **alarmist** views that may]{.mark} [contribute
to]{.mark} tensions and, at worst, the
**[militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the region if the Pentagon
deploys new resources in response to that perceived vulnerability. Other
concerns, such as China's interest in building airports in Greenland,
are best dealt with by diplomatic, information, and economic tools
rather than military platforms (though trying to buy Greenland probably
isn't the best approach). Even if a larger defense role in the Arctic is
warranted, the United States should focus first on developing concepts
for existing assets, determining what infrastructure requires
modernization, and carefully examining how initiatives elsewhere can
benefit regional security and minimize challenges emerging from the
region.

As the climate changes, human activity in the Arctic (and Antarctic)
will increase. There is a need for additional icebreakers to augment the
Coast Guard's law enforcement, search and rescue, disaster response,
situational awareness, and scientific support missions, among others.
Indeed, "polar icebreakers support 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory
missions." The only two not currently supported are "illegal drug
interdiction and undocumented migrant interdiction." Many of these tasks
clearly advance U.S. national security.

[But [placing icebreakers in]{.mark} a [central]{.mark} defense [role
comes with **opportunity costs.**]{.mark}]{.underline} If the United
States does field multiple new icebreakers, those ships may find defense
missions taking up more and more of their time. As a result, [[they will
be less able to support]{.mark} the myriad of [homeland security
and]{.mark} important [scientific missions]{.mark}]{.underline} they
will be increasingly called upon to perform. It is worth noting the
Coast Guard identified a need for six new icebreakers in 2013 (and gaps
in support for polar missions in 2010), before the public discussion in
Washington shifted to the return of great-power competition broadly and
in the Arctic specifically. Coast Guard polar security cutters will have
plenty to do without additional tasks to offset a perceived military
vulnerability arising from Russian and Chinese icebreakers.

How an icebreaker works

An icebreaker is exactly what it sounds like; a ship designed to break
up ice, either to create a passage for itself or to create a channel for
other ships to follow. A ship might be designed primarily for
icebreaking (like the Polar Star) or designed for icebreaking and other
duties. The French Le Commandant Charcot is a cruise ship with
icebreaking capabilities. Modern icebreakers are rated based on their
ability to break through ice and operate in various ice conditions.
Higher-rated icebreakers can continuously break through ice nearly 10
feet thick, and can ram through even thicker ice.

CHART OMITTED

Breaking ice requires a host of specific design features. Traditional
icebreakers pair high-powered engines with specially shaped hulls
designed to create downward pressure over the top of the ice, breaking
it apart under high tensile forces, as ice is weak in tension. For
particularly thick ice, or ice ridges, the entire front of the
icebreaker may be driven up onto the ice, breaking the ice beneath it.
The hull and ship structure must be strong enough to withstand the
impact of ice, and a heavily reinforced "ice-belt," often made of
special high-strength steel, is installed near the level of the
waterline. Things like air bubbler systems (which blow bubbles of air up
around the ship from beneath the water) and low-friction paint reduce
friction as the ship forces its way through the ice. Traditional
icebreaking hull shapes, while well suited to breaking through ice,
perform poorly in open ocean operations; the Polar Star has been dubbed
"The Polar Roller" due to its tendency to roll constantly.

The development of rotatable "azimuth" thrusters in the late 1980s,
sometimes known as azipods, changed the mechanics of icebreaking.
Icebreaking ships with azimuth thrusters are often designed to break ice
by moving backwards, using the propellers to break ice from below and to
flush the hull with water to reduce friction. Not only does this reduce
the power required to break ice, but it allows for the front (bow) of
the ship to be designed for better open water performance. Some modern
icebreakers are designed to use azimuth thrusters to move forward at an
oblique angle to create an especially wide channel.

GRAPHIC OMITTED

The [[specialized]{.mark} design [requirements]{.mark} and equipment
make [icebreaker]{.mark} ship design and construction a specialized
field of [expertise]{.mark}]{.underline}. A relatively small number of
shipbuilders are responsible for the lion's share of icebreaker design
and construction. By far the most experienced icebreaker builder in the
world is Finland. Because Finland's entire coast can freeze during the
winter, and because Finland depends on sea transport for over 90% of its
imports and exports, it maintains a large fleet of Baltic icebreakers to
keep shipping channels open. As a result, Finland has developed
unrivaled expertise in icebreaker construction. Finnish firms have
designed roughly 80% of the world's icebreakers and built 60% of them.

GRAPHIC OMITTED

History of U.S. icebreakers

Ships designed to break up ice became possible with the advent of steam
power. The U.S. built the first icebreaker in the world, the steam
powered City Ice Boat No. 1, in Philadelphia in 1837 to break ice on the
Delaware River. Icebreakers designed to operate in the arctic were built
as early as 1898 in Russia with the Yermak, but the U.S. didn't acquire
oceangoing icebreaking ships until 1942 with the light icebreaker
Storis, which became the first U.S. ship to traverse the Northwest
Passage. The Storis' icebreaking capabilities were minimal (one source
described the ship as "dainty"), and America's first true icebreakers
were the subsequent Wind-class ships. Built at the behest of President
Roosevelt, who asked for "the world's greatest icebreakers" to help
support air bases in Greenland and to help transport lend-lease cargo to
Russia's Arkhangelsk port, the U.S. built eight Wind-class icebreakers
between 1942 and 1946. At the time, they were considered the most
technologically advanced icebreakers in the world. The Wind-class ships
were followed by an even more powerful icebreaker, the Glacier, in 1954.

GRAPHIC OMITTED

In the 1960s, as the Wind-class ships aged, the Coast Guard began to
consider their replacement, and in 1971 awarded a contract to Lockheed
shipbuilding for the new Polar-class icebreakers, designed to be "the
world's most powerful icebreakers." The first Polar-class ship, the
Polar Star, was commissioned in 1976, followed by the Polar Sea in early
1977. When the Polar-class ships launched, the U.S. had five icebreaking
ships. And as the Wind-class ships continued to retire, this number
fell. By 1989, the U.S. had just two icebreakers.

GRAPHIC OMITTED

In the 1990s, funding was allocated for another icebreaker, the medium
icebreaker Healy, which was completed in 1999. Since then, no new polar
icebreakers have been built in the U.S. Both the Polar Sea and the Polar
Star continued to operate until 2010, when the Polar Sea suffered a
catastrophic breakdown of its engines. Since then, it has been in
drydock, acting as a source of spare parts for the Polar Star, as many
of those parts are no longer manufactured. The Polar Star is far past
its original service life, and it must spend nearly all its time between
McMurdo Station missions being repaired. During a major refurbishment of
the Polar Star in 2010, the head of the Coast Guard stated that "it's a
little uncertain to me how many more years we can get out of her in her
current condition." That was 14 years ago; today the Polar Star remains
America's only heavy icebreaker, and the only U.S. ship that can clear a
path through the ice to resupply McMurdo Station.

The Polar Security Cutter program

To replace its aging icebreakers with a new, larger fleet of ships, in
2013 the Coast Guard initiated its Polar Security Cutter program to
construct a series of new heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard solicited
bids in 2017, and the first contract was awarded in 2019, to VT Halter
Marine, with an expected delivery date of 2024 for the first ship. But
the program has gone poorly. While most icebreakers are custom designed
using proven concepts, the team of TAI and Halter Marine used a German
icebreaker that has yet to be built as a 'parent design', intending to
modify it for Coast Guard needs. After five years, this modification
still isn't complete; as of July 2024 the design was only 59% done, and
construction has not yet started. While the original delivery date for
the first ship was 2024, that has now been pushed back to 2029.

In a report and testimony, the [[GAO described]{.mark} some of the
**[problems]{.mark}** during the program:]{.underline}

- [[U.S.-]{.mark}based designers and ship[builders]{.mark} generally
  **[lacked experience]{.mark}** designing and building heavy polar
  icebreakers.]{.underline}

- [The [ship]{.mark} design [is **complex**]{.mark}]{.underline},
  including that it [[used]{.mark} a **[specialized]{.mark}** steel
  [alloy]{.mark} that [required]{.mark} technical study and development
  of [new]{.mark} welding [procedures]{.mark} before use.]{.underline}

- The shipbuilder overestimated the extent to which it could leverage
  the original design and had to make significant design changes to meet
  government specifications, according to program officials. [The
  [shipbuilder]{.mark} also [made]{.mark} some **[design
  errors]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as selecting the wrong height for
  the lowest deck of the ship, which required significant, late redesign
  to correct.

- [COVID-19]{.underline} restrictions limited the extent to which the
  shipbuilder could collaborate and consult with its domestic and
  international partners.

Notably, VT Halter Marine lost \$256 million between 2017 and 2021,
after which it was bought for a song (just \$15 million) by Bollinger,
which took over the icebreaker contracts.

Originally, the Polar Security Cutters were expected to cost \$800-\$900
million per ship (\$1.1-\$1.3 billion in 2024 dollars), but current cost
estimates are closer to \$1.7-1.9 billion, and given that construction
hasn't started yet, this is likely to rise. And it's unclear if that
2029 date will be hit either. The GAO report notes [that "the
[shipyard]{.mark} is [completing]{.mark}, on average, approximately
**[three percent]{.mark}** of functional design and six percent of
transitional design [every six months]{.mark}. At that design completion
rate, it [would take]{.mark} the shipyard approximately **[eight
years]{.mark}** to complete functional design."]{.underline}

By contrast, [[a Finnish shipyard can build]{.mark} a heavy
icebreaker]{.underline} for just a few hundred million dollars, and
deliver it [[within two]{.mark} years]{.underline}, instead of 10 or
more. However, the Coast Guard opted not to pursue a foreign
manufacturer, instead choosing a U.S. shipyard. The culprit here isn't
the Jones Act, but another protectionist shipbuilding law that requires
Naval and Coast Guard ships to be built in U.S. shipyards. It's possible
to waive this requirement via presidential authorization, but there
hasn't appeared to be much interest in this. Waiving this requirement
and allowing the Coast Guard to buy icebreakers from Finland would
likely save over a billion dollars per ship, as well as years of
construction time.

Barring acquiring Finnish icebreakers, the next best option for the U.S.
icebreaker program would have been awarding the contract to a team that
had icebreaker experience. Finnish shipbuilding firms previously
assisted during the design and construction of the Healy. Of the three
bids submitted for the Polar Security Cutter program, two were from U.S.
shipyards partnered with European firms that had previously designed and
built icebreakers. The winning bid from VT Halter was, bizarrely, the
only bid without an experienced partner.

The U.S. has made some gestures to try and improve its icebreaker
construction with the ICE Pact, a non-binding agreement to collaborate
and share information on icebreaker design and construction. But experts
appear skeptical as to whether this will have much impact, as it's
predicated on attracting foreign orders for U.S.-built icebreakers that
aren't likely to materialize.

Conclusion

With [[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, we see [[a **microcosm**
o]{.mark}f the [**broader** problems]{.mark} we looked at [in U.S.
shipbuilding.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Icebreakers are **far more
expensive**]{.mark} to build ([and take **much longer**]{.mark} to
build) in]{.underline} the U.S. than in foreign shipyards, and it's only
a series of protectionist laws that drive any icebreaker construction
here at all.

We also see the same cultural issues that we saw with American
shipbuilding more broadly[. [There seems to be]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[lack of motivation]{.mark}** to take maritime issues seriously or
treat them as important]{.underline}. For decades, the U.S. has been
willing to accept an undersized icebreaker fleet -- complaints about
insufficient icebreakers date back to the 1980s. There appears to be
little interest in trying to ameliorate this by acquiring foreign
icebreakers, even though that would be comparatively simple, far
cheaper, and far faster. And the Coast Guard apparently did not think
icebreakers were important enough to select a team for building them
that had icebreaker experience, even though it's a niche, specialized
area of marine construction.

As a result, icebreaking can be added to the list of things like
dredging and offshore wind turbine installation: areas that have been
shackled to America's inefficient shipbuilding industry and have
inflicted costs on the country in the process.

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to cut through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
U.S.'s only icebreaker that operates year-round, and it was built nearly
half a century ago.

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic, icebreakers are
the essential tool to open trade routes, allow resource extraction and
project military power. The U.S. and its allies have fallen far behind
Russia, and China is rapidly gaining ground with the help of the world's
largest shipbuilding industry.

President **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [signaled]{.mark} that
[he wants to put the Arctic back at the top of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U.S.'s **priority list**]{.underline}]{.mark}. He has said the U.S.
needs to take ownership of Greenland for national security and that the
Coast Guard will expand its fleet of icebreakers.

"We're going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers. Big ones,"
Trump said last month.

[[That will be a **tall order** to **fill**]{.mark}. [The U.S. has been
struggling for years to build a]{.mark} **[single
icebreaker]{.mark}**---vessels that **clear a path** through the **ice

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[meanwhile]{.mark}, [has around **40
icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as new giant nuclear-powered
ones under construction. Despite being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle,
China has four such vessels. Its first domestically built
nuclear-powered icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year,
experts say.

Russia has faced setbacks in recent years. Sanctions over the Ukraine
war have limited its access to components and technologies needed to
build icebreakers, such as propulsion systems and radar equipment. A
nuclear-powered icebreaker under construction called Rossiya is running
three years behind schedule. But it already has a massive lead and years
of experience operating in the Arctic.

As in other areas, Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions. [It took a Chinese shipyard two years to deliver
one **recent icebreaker**. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will be a
heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction started
only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to build
it.]{.underline}

The Russian Arctic does have mind-boggling amounts of oil and natural
gas. (The U.S. and Canadian Arctic has lots, too, but [[it's]{.mark}
easier and [**cheaper** to frack in North Dakota than]{.mark} to drill
in [the Chukchi Sea.) Tapping]{.mark} those [oil and gas]{.mark}
reserves [is **challenging**]{.mark}]{.underline} enough, but Russia has
been able to do it, to an extent, despite a decade of Western sanctions
that have handicapped some of its frontier energy projects. [[The tricky
part is to move that gas]{.mark} from the frozen north to thirsty
markets in Asia:]{.underline} Arctic ice may be melting, but that
doesn't mean those are warm-water ports or easy to navigate.

Especially after the onset of the war in Ukraine, which largely
foreclosed European energy export markets to Russia, Arctic energy and
its shipping routes to the east have become a key strategic priority for
Putin. The Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia is the epicenter of
Russia's newfound trade in liquefied natural gas, or LNG; since piping
it to Europe is no longer an option, and China is proving a hard
bargainer on piped gas headed east, freezing it and shipping it out is
the future for Russian energy.

For Putin, the so-called Northern Sea Route (NSR)---the would-be
shipping lane across the top of Russia---is the embodiment of his
end-run around Europe and toward a full embrace with China. Moscow has
visions of the route becoming a genuine global sea lane to rival such
routes as the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal, no matter the fact that
container ships cannot and will not save a few days' journey by
venturing into shallow, ice-filled, foggy waters that Russia calls its
own and taxes as such. In 2023, [[the NSR]{.mark} had its [best
year]{.mark} yet, [shipping]{.mark} a whopping [36 million]{.mark}
metric [tons. The Suez]{.mark} Canal]{.underline}, when not disrupted by

previously being [[built for Russia in So]{.underline}]{.mark}uth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea, [[but]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} war
**[put paid to that]{.mark}**,]{.underline} with Seoul canceling the
pending delivery of new ice-class tankers. (Western dry docks are still
servicing the existing fleet, though.) [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is
trying to build some of its own, and probably can, but it [[may
**struggle** to master]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [advanced
[cargo]{.mark} containment [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology that was a
Western monopoly, Hovilainen said.

[That is [part of]{.mark} an evolving Western [strategy to **strike**
at]{.mark} the [**Russian weakness**]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}
Just after the invasion of Ukraine, [Western [sanctions
**poleaxed**]{.mark} the big [LNG liquefaction]{.mark} facility in the
Yamal Peninsula]{.underline}, which was reliant on Western technology.
Novatek, the private Russian company plowing ahead, now hopes to
jury-rig a solution to get its gas super-chilled and super-moving by
2026, but it is employing unproven workarounds. [[The
facility]{.underline}]{.mark} upped production and even started exports
this summer but [[is]{.mark} still running **[below
capacity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The West has found other chinks in the armor. This summer, [[the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion, in its 14th
sanctions package on Russia, [specifically [targeted]{.mark} Russian
[transshipment]{.mark} of LNG [in European
ports]{.mark}]{.underline}---Moscow would use precious ice tankers to
ship gas south, then move the gas to a regular tanker for export
overseas. With that trade foreclosed, [Russia's hard-worked LNG tanker
fleet will have to make the full run from Siberia to the final
destination and back again, essentially [cutting its]{.mark}
energy-export [capacity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Or take the latest Western step to hit Russia. In late August, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [went after Russia's LNG
[**shadow fleet**]{.mark} with new [sanctions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
latest sanctions not only [**[intensify]{.mark}** the
**[pressure]{.mark}** on Russian gas production and liquefaction in the
Arctic]{.underline}, but they also [[take aim at]{.mark} the fleet of
specialized [tankers]{.mark}]{.underline} that Moscow needs to build up
in order to get its product to its last remaining big market. The goal,
the U.S. State Department said, is [[to]{.mark} "further
**[disrupt]{.mark}**"]{.underline} both [[**production** and
**export**]{.mark} of Arctic LNG]{.underline}, especially relevant now
that the big plant in Yamal is up and running again.

If there is a great-power competition in the Arctic, it is only
existential for one of the players. And [t[he recipe for success is
**not**]{.mark} building [more icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, welcome
as they may be, [[but]{.mark} making sure that those in Russian hands
are opening leads to nowhere.]{.underline}

"We are [[**pressuring** Russia with **economic tools**]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, which is a cost-effective means of pursuing our
goals. Russia's icebreaker fleet is all about energy exports to Asia,"
Pincus said. "That's why the sanctions are smart. If we can sustain
them, and the Russian Arctic oil and gas reserves and facilities become
stranded assets, then what is the Arctic to Russia? That could end up
starving the NSR."

What's not clear about the ICE Pact, though, is what it will actually
deliver or how it will work; the outlines of the collaboration pact as
announced so far do not tackle the fundamental
[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that have
**[[bedeviled]{.underline}]{.mark}** decades of [[U.S. efforts]{.mark}
to build the kind of ship]{.underline} that China turns out inside of
two years.

[[Foreign shipyards]{.underline}]{.mark}, for starters, [are
[**off-limits** for]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [[Coast Guard and naval
vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}, yet they are the ones with the specialized
workforces[. [U.S. shipyards, **bereft of investment**]{.underline},
**[workers]{.underline}**]{.mark}, work orders, [[and]{.mark} even
[**dry docks**, have]{.mark} enough **[trouble]{.mark}** even
[building]{.mark} the congressionally mandated number of nuclear
submarines, let alone a new class of vessel.]{.underline} Misguided
adventures, such as choosing an unproven German design for the new polar
cutter rather than a tested blueprint, only add to the woes.

The ICE Pact, Pincus said, is a little bit like AUKUS, the three-way
deal among Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom to bring
nuclear submarine technology down under. "Except this time, we're the
Australians," she said of the United States. "What price are we going to
have to pay for their expertise?"

Why does the country that invented the nuclear aircraft carrier find it
so difficult to build a ship that can drive straight into a six-foot
chunk of ice and keep going? It turns out that
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, like nuclear carriers and subs,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} very [**[complicated]{.mark}** to design and
build]{.underline}, and practice does indeed make perfect. [Icebreakers
[need]{.mark} not only **[special]{.mark}**]{.underline}ly [strengthened
[hulls]{.mark},]{.underline} with different attributes depending on
whether they will crush the ice or shear it, but also [[**massive
engines** and]{.mark} absolute **[all-weather

to U.S.--China Relations: Reversing the Slide Toward Crisis and
Conflict,\"

Core Restraint Views A Restraint approach to U.S.--China relations is
founded upon and reflects several overall views and assumptions
regarding both vital American national interests and policies and
several key features of the international system. One core Restraint set
of views is that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} unnecessarily
[[**over-extended** in]{.mark} its **[military involvement]{.mark}**
across the globe]{.underline}, has an excessively broad definition of
its vital interests, [[and too frequently relies on
**military**]{.underline}]{.mark} over diplomatic
**[[means]{.underline}]{.mark}** to defend those interests while seeking
to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, economic and military
dominance worldwide and to extend democracy to as many nations as
possible.2 A second Restraint view that follows from the above is the
notion that post--Cold War [[efforts to maintain]{.mark} U.S. global
**military [primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether **[[emphasizing
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** or active intervention, have most
often [**[produce]{.mark}**d [a]{.mark} **more dangerous**, **[less
stable world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby undermining the most vital
U.S. interest of safeguarding the security and well--being of the
American people.3 The United States is physically very secure behind two
oceans and with two friendly neighbors on its borders, and in any event
has the capability, through nuclear weapons and a territory--based
conventional power projection capability, to counter any direct or
indirect military threats to its most vital interests. The definition of
[vital national interests]{.underline} should thus be limited to the
defense and preservation of conditions directly necessary to the
territorial integrity, security, and well--being of the American people
and their way of life. This primarily requires the ability to protect
the nation against both direct and indirect, national, transnational,
and subnational threats to such interests, and a stable global order
open, as much as possible, to trade, investment, technological
innovation, and people--to--people contacts. It also requires
co--existence with countries with different political systems, congruent
with a stable and open global order. Above all, it requires a strong and
cohesive domestic political, economic, and social order. It [does
**not** require]{.underline} absolute security, the maintenance of [a
prominent global military presence,]{.underline} a reliance on [frequent
overseas military forays,]{.underline} [or]{.underline} extensive,
formal, often **[one--sided, security commitments]{.underline}** to a
wide range of other nations. A third Restraint viewpoint stresses the
fact that [the international system]{.underline} within which the United
States defends or advances its interests [is **no longer
unipolar**]{.underline}.4 The conditions that elevated the United States
to the status of global hegemon after the fall of the Soviet Union in
1991 no longer exist and cannot be restored. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has no]{.underline} practical [alternative but to
accept the reality of an increasingly multipolar world and recognize
that]{.underline} both **[continued U.S. dominance]{.underline}** and
world peace [are **illusions**]{.underline}. For the foreseeable future,
[mutual coexistence, compromise, and balance among the great powers will
have to suffice]{.underline} as an operative conception of "peace."5
This concept thus rejects the use of distorting and dangerous, usually
zero--sum ideological frameworks in understanding global politics, such
as "democracy versus authoritarianism," or a singular stress on "great
power competition."6 The Restraint view holds that, within this system,
[two **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential international
[**threats** endanger humankind]{.underline} above all else in the
present century: [first]{.underline}, the increased possibility of
large--scale **[nuclear war]{.underline}** ([as a result of]{.underline}
proliferation, new technologies, the erosion of arms control agreements,
and [deepening great power rivalries]{.underline}); [and
second]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} largely
**[unchecked]{.underline}** worsening of the **[climate
crisis]{.underline}** as the preeminent expression of global
environmental degradation.7 A third threat is primarily domestic and
mostly affects democratic states, although it certainly also has
international implications: the rise of extremely nationalist,
anti--democratic, race--based nativism and the political polarization
and dysfunction it engenders.8 For Restraint advocates, these threats
supersede any supposed global, value--based threats, including the
commonly perceived inflated and distorted international struggle between
democracy and authoritarianism, as well as narrower, conventional
security or economic rivalries among non--nuclear powers. In assessing
the role of diplomacy (and other non--military forms of international
engagement and conflict resolution) versus military force, despite the
introduction of new technologies, Restrainers believe that military
conflict remains fraught with risk, uncertainty, higher than expected
costs, and the likelihood of unexpected consequences. This fact, along
with the gradual emergence of a multipolar order and the frequent
historical failures of U.S.--led attempts to invade, occupy, and remake
distant nation--states, provide good reasons to prioritize diplomacy and
economic or other forms of non--violent tools of statecraft over
military intervention.9 While the political use of military capabilities
is in many cases essential in the conduct of diplomacy, any actual use
of force should be considered a last resort, employed only under extreme
conditions, and in the defense of vital interests only. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, as the
dominant military and economic power on the planet, [has
[developed]{.mark} and maintained [the **dangerous notion**]{.mark} that
only [American]{.mark} global **[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
"leadership" [[can keep the world **peaceful**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
ensure prosperity.10 Restrainers believe [this idea has led the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage]{.underline}
frequently [in]{.underline} a [**feckless misuse** of military
power]{.underline}, [resulting]{.underline} in large part [from
**inflated threats**]{.underline}, overconfidence, and a deep belief in
American exceptionalism. With the possible exception of Israel, [[**no
nation** employs force as frequently]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover,
many Americans remain strongly supportive of high levels of U.S. defense
spending and Washington's many global security alliances. However, many
[citizens are]{.underline} also [growing weary of U.S. military
interventions and]{.underline} the heavy [reliance on **military**
**options**]{.underline} in handling foreign problems.11 Large numbers
of Americans now favor diplomacy over military force.12 And some
question the need for large numbers of overseas military bases around
the world.13 This suggests popular support for a Restraint--oriented
foreign policy, including reduced defense spending if and as security
competitions with other great powers are reduced. Compounding the
problems caused by military intervention in the service of primacy is
the emergence in the United States of deep levels of public uncertainty
and insecurity about the future. The many factors underlying this
feeling of uncertainty include a crisis of legitimacy involving
widespread dissatisfaction with prevailing conceptions of freedom and
democracy when viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality,
as well as egregious government ineptitude, fiscal irresponsibility, and
persistent social problems.14 Politicians often exploit the worsening
domestic situation by inflating the threats posed by undemocratic states
like China to divert attention from their own responsibility for
problems at home and to unify their political base.15 Domestic
circumstances have also created a strong tendency toward an excessive
level of economic protectionism which, in the absence of countervailing
domestic policies, undermines growth and weakens incentives to cooperate
with China and other nations in handling common global economic and
financial threats.16 Restrainers assert that this dynamic, along with a
deeply--rooted commitment to sustaining high levels of defense spending
and hundreds of overseas bases, are increasing the chance of conflict
with non--democratic powers while undermining efforts to properly
define, prioritize and deal with threats at home and abroad.17 Finally,
many U.S. [friends and allies have]{.underline} both [the capacity and
the need to do **far more** to provide for their **own
defense**]{.underline}, thereby [allowing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to significantly reduce its **own global military
posture**]{.underline}. But Restraint does not encourage those countries
to rapidly ramp up their defense spending. Deepening interdependence,
the possibility of large--scale nuclear war, and the emergence of high
priority common security threats such as climate change all argue in
favor of efforts to reduce interstate security competition, which would
lower the need for ever higher defense budgets, and enhance incentives
for more cooperative forms of security.18 If successfully implemented,
[**[Restraint]{.mark}** as a basis of policy]{.underline} vis--à--vis
China [[will **buy**]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[**time** to]{.mark} repair its]{.underline}
severely [damaged domestic order and **[reallocate]{.mark}** national
security [resources]{.mark}]{.underline} to concerns that pose a greater
threat to the security and well--being of the American people than
China. More broadly, [[it will facilitate]{.mark} the identification of
**clear red lines**]{.underline} based on the protection of genuinely
vital interests, the adoption of prudent and balanced approaches to
contentious issues, [and]{.underline} the opening of intellectual and
political space allowing for **[greater
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}**, understanding, [[and
**compromise**]{.mark} between Washington and Beijing]{.underline}.19
[[This will]{.mark} significantly **[reduce]{.mark} the chances of
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Urgent Need to Right--Size the
China Threat Multipolarity and the end of American dominance, rising
domestic problems, looming, high--priority transnational threats, heavy
levels of global economic and technological interdependence, and the
resulting need to create a stable long--term basis for productive and
peaceful coexistence together justify an array of Restraint--based U.S.
policies toward Beijing. This must begin with a serious effort to
right--size the threats and opportunities that China poses, both now and
over time, to the international system, American democracy, economic
growth, and U.S. national security.20 Right--sizing the threats posed by
China, along with a fact--based assessment of current and likely future
U.S. and Western resources and capabilities, will provide the foundation
for a realistic and effective Restraint--based strategy toward China. A
responsible Restraint perspective acknowledges that there are
competitive aspects to the Sino--U.S. relationship, and that a
Sino--U.S. security dilemma, along with low levels of trust, is to some
extent unavoidable, especially given the different political systems of
the two nations and China's growing power, both globally and especially
in Asia. However, the security dilemma can certainly be alleviated
significantly, and not all great power competition need be zero--sum in
nature. Furthermore, most Sino--U.S. competitions will not end in a neat
"victory" for one side over the other, unless one or both regimes
collapse, an unlikely prospect. Excessive levels and types of
competition can unnecessarily undermine attempts at cooperation over
issues such as climate change, as trust disappears and the good will
needed to fashion mutual compromises evaporates.21 [The current U.S.
[policy toward China is]{.mark} largely [based on a]{.mark}
**zero--sum**, **[adversarial mindset]{.mark}** that assumes above all
else a **fundamental Chinese commitment** to **weakening** and
**countering the West**]{.underline} and resisting any form of
meaningful bilateral cooperation. [Beijing is regularly presented as a
vaguely--defined **existential threat**]{.underline}, a rapidly growing
military and economic power [bent on **global domination**]{.underline}
through predatory trade and investment practices and/or armed coercion,
a burgeoning high--tech superpower determined to control the key drivers
of future global growth, a hostile opponent of the existing so--called
"rules--based" international order, and a pernicious threat to
democratic societies from within.22 Moreover, in many instances, the
alarm over such supposedly dire threats is magnified by the inaccurate
claim that Washington had been essentially asleep at the wheel until
very recently as China worked to undermine the United States and all
democratic societies.23 China does pose certain challenges to existing
and likely future U.S. interests. These consist primarily of: • In the
military arena, the danger of costly and destabilizing conflicts or
severe crises, resulting from military and political provocations by
either Beijing or Washington (or by U.S. allies) e.g., over Taiwan,
disputed territories in Asia, the Korean Peninsula, or as a result of
incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft operating in
close proximity to one another.24 Chinese military and political actions
could also weaken U.S. alliances and reduce support for the
forward--deployed U.S. military presence in Asia and elsewhere, thereby
increasing the likelihood of arms races and miscalculations by the
United States, China, and other states.25 • In the economic and
technological area,26 the possibility of Chinese behavior eroding U.S.
economic growth rates, U.S. competitiveness in some key high--tech
areas, and possibly, in some extreme cases, U.S. access to certain
technologies and critical regions, most notably Asia. Chinese actions in
this area could also reduce the incentives for other nations to trade
and invest heavily with the United States, whether as a result of
Chinese pressure or zero--sum forms of competitiveness. China could
weaken free market norms in various ways, through its loan practices and
political influence. And Beijing could damage key U.S. corporations by
ejecting them from the critical Chinese market. • In the area of norms
and values, a concern that Chinese behavior over time could weaken
existing Western norms regarding liberal democratic governance, centered
on the rule of law, freedom of political speech and behavior, various
cyber freedoms, and individual voter rights, as well as current or
future norms concerning forms of foreign international intervention
relating to human rights. China challenges many of these norms by
stressing economic and physical security and top-down state authority
over the protection of individual political freedoms and the activities
of non-state actors outside of government control. While certainly very
troublesome, and requiring effective countermeasures in many cases,
[these concerns are not grave enough to justify the kind of absolute,
largely **zero--sum** and **confrontational approach** now common in
U.S. policies toward Beijing]{.underline}. Many [**gray areas** exist in
all three of the above realms, largely reflecting Chinese support for
long--standing core principles of the international order, such as
**state sovereignty**, a preference for **diplomacy** over
**force**]{.underline} in resolving disputes, [the use of force only in
defense of **imminent**]{.underline} and clear **[security
threats]{.underline}**, [open]{.underline} air and sea [lines of
communication]{.underline} and transport across international zones,
many [market--based forms of economic intercourse]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} various other **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[norms]{.underline}** and approaches. In
fact, critics of China's global stance often conflate the values and
norms of the global order, as reflected in various international regimes
and practices, with the U.S.--centered structure of global economic and
military power.27 In reality, the preservation or constructive
adaptation of most of the values, structures, and processes of the
global order does not require a single, dominant, democratic ruling
power. The limited and contingent nature of Chinese threats requires a
strong, competitive United States, clearer, more extensive, and to the
extent possible, binding bilateral and international agreements, and
specific, credible red lines regarding violations of truly vital
interests. It also requires a common international commitment to resolve
differences over contentious issues such as Taiwan, political rights and
protectionism or state capitalism through negotiation and compromise.
[Contrary to the prevailing mindset]{.underline} in Washington, [China
does not pose an **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential
**[threat to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates in the
above areas. [It is not in a position]{.underline} either to replace the
dominance of U.S. and Western economic and military power worldwide or
[to **overturn**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} so--called
**[liberal]{.underline}** world **[order]{.underline}**.28 As a military
power, Beijing poses no threat to the existence of the United States
except possibly via an extremely unlikely nuclear attack, which would be
suicidal. There is no evidence that China wants to threaten, much less
use, its relatively small (but growing), second--strike, counter--value
strategic nuclear force to attack the United States or its allies. To
the contrary, there is much evidence to suggest that [China's leadership
regards nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline} predominantly [as a
**deterrent**, not as a possible first--strike, offensive war
weapon]{.underline}.29 Moreover, Beijing's recent improvements of its
strategic nuclear forces are almost certainly intended primarily to
increase the survivability of its second--strike force in the face of
significant improvements in U.S. offensive nuclear capabilities and
ballistic missile defense. [The Chinese might]{.underline} also [be
expanding their nuclear arsenal in response to an increased fear that
Washington would]{.underline} level [nuclear threats or]{.underline}
actually [employ tactical nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} a future [Taiwan]{.underline} conflict, if the U.S.
military were losing on a conventional level.30 That speaks to the
urgent need to stabilize that worsening situation (as discussed below).
On the conventional level, Chinese military capabilities are for the
foreseeable future only of serious concern in the western Pacific, where
Beijing has reached a rough parity of forces with the United States and
Japan along the first island chain near Taiwan, and is arguably now the
dominant military power in the South China Sea, as measured in numbers
of naval and air platforms.31 But even in this vast region, [China is
not poised to acquire the kind of overwhelming conventional power that
would give it the military confidence]{.underline}, even in the face of
high political and economic costs, [to attempt to **seize Taiwan by
force**]{.underline}, [eject the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from the region, or assert total]{.underline},
direct [control over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea or maritime Asia as a whole --- unless, that is, the
United States were to force it to undertake the acquisition of such
capabilities and take such actions by threatening to permanently
separate Taiwan from China, or by precipitating a conflict in the
region.32 [Fears that China]{.underline} has decided in the near or
medium future to invade Taiwan and, going further, [is
planning]{.underline} eventual [aggression against other Asian states
are]{.underline} therefore **[unconvincing]{.underline}**.33 [The
lessons of]{.underline} the U.S. invasion of [**Iraq** and]{.underline}
particularly Russia's failures in [**Ukraine** reinforce for the Chinese
the difficulties of]{.underline} an all--out **[invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**, as discussed further in the appendix.34 Beyond
this, [[China is **nowhere near** acquiring]{.mark} the [capabilities to
replace the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as
a global military hegemon and shows few if any signs of having made a
commitment to do so.35 [This would require a force structure capable of
successfully fending off any attempt to defeat Chinese military
components within]{.underline} virtually [**any** ocean or air
space]{.underline}, and to safeguard passage to virtually any major
world port. The United States has enjoyed something approaching this
capacity for decades. [China is **far from attaining it** and currently
has **no clear imperative** to do so.]{.underline} This does not mean
China will eschew developing a military with a significant global
presence. It has already done this to some extent in the naval realm.
And Chinese leaders have said that their goal is to develop "world-class
forces" by 2049.36 But such a presence could take many forms well below
anything approaching that of the U.S. military today, including
relatively small--sized, high--quality flotillas or expeditionary groups
capable of conducting a variety of important missions well short of
achieving control overall critical international ocean areas and air
spaces.37 The above suggests that [China is unlikely to undertake an
**unprovoked**]{.underline}, out--of--the--blue **[lunge at
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [or **anywhere else** in the region]{.underline},
either today or in the near--to--medium---term (i.e., to about 2035).
[[The **most prominent threat** will emerge from
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulations**]{.underline} [[stemming from efforts by
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates, China,
and other nations [[to **deter**]{.underline}]{.mark} one another [in an
**extreme**]{.underline}, zero--sum [manner within a]{.underline}n
increasingly [**hostile** and **polarized** security landscape. [This
could involve]{.mark} a high--risk miscalculation and]{.underline}
resulting **[[overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the use of
military force]{.underline} by one or both sides [[stemming
from]{.underline}]{.mark} excessive [[**overconfidence** or
**insecurity**, in response to]{.mark} perceived
**[provocations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
primary]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**--related
**[threat]{.underline}** is not about the threat Beijing poses to the
United States, other nations, or the global order. It is the threat that
[arises from an interactive, **worsening security
competition**]{.underline} driven by threat inflation and zero--sum
worst casing of actions and motives on both sides.38 Moreover, [the
Chinese]{.underline} almost [certainly realize that any effort to
achieve]{.underline} global (or even regional) **[military
dominance]{.underline}** over the United States [will prove]{.underline}
extremely **[costly]{.underline}**, [could]{.underline} ultimately
[**fail**, or place it in a]{.underline} virtually
[endless]{.underline}, mutually debilitating zero--sum [military
rivalry]{.underline} with Washington. [This]{.underline} sort of gamble
i[s even more unlikely given the **enormous domestic challenges** that
[China faces]{.mark}, including]{.underline} high levels of
[[**pollution**, a]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly **[[aging
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a weakened leadership succession
system, [[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic natural
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [low]{.underline} levels of
[productivity]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} an excessively
ideological, **[repressive]{.underline}**, and top--down
[policy]{.underline} approach to [development]{.underline} and social
order.39 [[These]{.mark} challenges [demand]{.mark} a
continuous]{.underline}, long--term [[emphasis on]{.underline}]{.mark}
ensuring [**[domestic order]{.mark}** and **growth**, not expanding
China's powers to **dominate**]{.underline} all
**[others]{.underline}**. All this implies that, despite its ambitious
goals, likely belief that the West is in decline, and increasing
suspicion and pushback toward the United States, [Beijing's policies
will]{.underline} necessarily [allow]{.underline} for some level of
[flexibility that could make]{.underline} global (and even Asian)
[competition more constructive and less destructive]{.underline}, while
keeping many doors open to some level of meaningful cooperation between
the two powers, including in the military--security arena. It is
certainly not inconceivable that growing threats to China's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) and overseas economic and political interests
could one day cause China's leaders to fundamentally reassess the
nation's strategic interests and goals in the direction of a costly,
dominance--oriented military strategy. Nonetheless, it would be reckless
to assume that such a reassessment is inevitable and that the many
factors in favor of cooperation and balance in China's present--day
global (and regional) strategy will disappear. Indeed, [the huge costs
and risks involved in a Chinese attempt to displace the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates as the dominant global military
power [are unlikely to diminish to such a degree]{.underline} in the
decades ahead [that Beijing would conclude it is worth the
effort]{.underline} to undertake --- **[unless]{.underline}**, of
course, [Washington makes it clear that it is using its]{.underline}
global [military dominance]{.underline} to support efforts [to
**strangle China** and **threaten the stability** of its
**government**]{.underline}.40 In the economic and technological arenas,
blanket, unqualified characterizations of China's economy as "predatory"
or "mercantilist" and its loan and assistance programs as
"debt--inducing" distort the reality that some Chinese abuses exist
alongside huge levels of mutual economic benefit for many countries.41
Moreover, China poses a limited, not comprehensive and existential,
economic and technological threat to the United States, in the form of
commercial and technology theft (of which at least the latter is
apparently diminishing), unfair trading practices, and other activities
that result in unfair advantages or possibly dominance in some specific
areas.42 It is highly unlikely that such practices would result in
decisive Chinese leverage over the United States, given the likelihood
of continued American global economic and technological power and
expertise, based on the continuation of its high--quality higher
education system, its rule of law, its competitive energy and drive, its
overall receptivity to talented immigrants, and its ample domestic
resource base.43 All of these features urgently need strengthening. But
this places an even greater premium on reducing distracting and
destructive tensions with China. And in any event, America's advantages
are unlikely to diminish to such an extent that China will achieve
decisive leverage over the United States, given its own huge domestic
problems. There is also the threat that would result from excessive
decoupling of the United States and China in many economic and
technological areas. Such actions would produce high levels of
inefficiency, lower the benefits of global exchange, and create
excessive confidence in the quixotic goal of removing all
vulnerabilities to the U.S. economy.44 As a result, U.S. (and Chinese)
economic growth and resiliency would decline, along with overall global
growth and prosperity. In addition, it is virtually certain that [any
effort by Beijing to create a **Sino-centric**]{.underline}, hegemonic
regional (or global) [**order** would encounter **serious
resistance**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} many other [major
states]{.underline} aside from the United States (such as Japan, South
Korea, India, Germany, France, and the U.K.), many of
[which]{.underline} have or could muster considerable economic and
military capabilities and [would]{.underline} politically and
ideologically [**oppose** being dominated by an **autocratic
China**]{.underline}. Although these states could not counterbalance
Chinese aggression on their own, they would likely unify to greatly
augment a U.S. effort to do so, if necessary.45 Regarding global norms,
despite assertions by some to the contrary, [China is **not
committed**]{.underline} (and does not have the capability) [to
**overturn**]{.underline} what many describe as [the **global
order**]{.underline}, replacing it with an autocratic, mercantilist,
Sinocentric order.46 First, this argument relies on the false notion
that such an order is centered primarily, if not solely, on the three
principles of democracy, human rights, and a free market economic
system. In reality, [the global order consists of a wide array of
norm--based regimes and understandings]{.underline}, only some of which
are associated with Western--defined concepts.47 Moreover, numerous
studies have shown that [[Beijing **benefits from** and
**upholds**]{.mark} the goals and **[norms]{.mark}** of many of these
regimes]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those governing relatively
[**[free trade]{.mark}** and finance]{.underline}, weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) **[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [[freedom of
**navigation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the **[[peaceful
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of disputes, [and]{.underline} the
management of [transnational security threats]{.underline} China presses
for reforms in global institutions that are, in many cases, long
overdue, including the idea of providing greater representation for
China and developing states in multilateral economic organizations.48
Beijing does want to reduce the influence of Western liberal democratic
values within global regimes in favor of a more state--centered set of
views that reflect the values of economic growth, top--down political
control, limited political freedoms, and social order. However, despite
some American rhetoric to the contrary, [Beijing is not energetically
engaged in a deliberate effort to duplicate its system across the
world]{.underline}, nor poised to establish a predatory, debt--inducing
network of dominance across Eurasia via the Belt and Road Initiative.49
In fact, unlike many 19th and early 20th century imperialist powers,
with some limited exceptions during the revolutionary Mao Zedong era in
the 1970s, [China has **not espoused an ideology** or **mindset** that
views the **acquisition of other territories** or the coercive expansion
of its system]{.underline} to other countries [as essential]{.underline}
to its continued national vitality.50 Finally[, the so--called global
order is rapidly becoming a multipolar order that **no single country**
can **dominate**]{.underline} in most or all spheres.51 Hence, even if
Beijing wanted to create a Sinocentric order, it is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to see how they could make this happen. Despite the
above developments and conflicting interests, Beijing continues to
recognize its own need to sustain substantive areas of cooperation with
Washington and to avoid slipping into a truly adversarial, destructive,
and purely mercantilist form of competition. While increasingly
assertive, the Chinese see the obvious problems of such a stance. Of
course, it is possible that Beijing eventually comes to regard the high
risks of engaging in such intense competition as worth taking, if the
danger of not doing so increases. Such a change in perception could
occur in part as a result of [[a]{.mark} continued U.S.]{.underline} or
broader Western [[drive toward]{.mark} **[confrontation]{.mark}** and
**zero--sum competition** with Beijing.]{.underline} This development
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} greatly
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [[voices within China who
favor **moderation**]{.mark} in the **U.S.--China
rivalry**]{.underline}. In addition [it would]{.underline} significantly
[[**raise the danger** of Sino--American **crises**]{.mark} and
**military conflict**]{.underline}, [[and divert]{.mark}
**[huge]{.mark}** amounts of U.S. [**resources** away from]{.mark}
**desperately needed**]{.underline} non--military **[uses at
[home]{.mark}]{.underline}** and abroad.52 The Key Elements of a
Restraint Approach to China From the above, it is clear that
[a]{.underline} responsible [Restraint strategy toward China
should]{.underline} seek to [[replace]{.mark} the]{.underline} current,
largely zero--sum, comprehensive competition and
[**[confrontation]{.mark} with Beijing** [with]{.mark} a
stable]{.underline}, balanced, mutually beneficial [form of **[peaceful
coexistence]{.mark}** and bounded competition]{.underline} that can
sustain global peace and prosperity while effectively addressing the
primary threats facing both countries. [This will require]{.underline} a
policy toward China geared to effective deterrence regarding red lines,
alongside mutual, credible reassurance in key areas, and the
**[[channeling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [Sino--U.S. [competition
into]{.mark}]{.underline} as many **[[constructive
realms]{.underline}]{.mark}** as possible, [most
importantly]{.underline} including the [effort to combat]{.underline}
the overriding threats posed by **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, WMD
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
global financial and [**[economic disorder]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [An
open--ended]{.underline}, winner--take--all [**[security
competition]{.mark}** can substantially [increase the chance of]{.mark}
**crises** and [**conflict** and **eliminate options for
coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[in]{.underline} [dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the truly **[[existential
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** all nations face. Ending hostile,
zero--sum political rhetoric, and replacing simplistic, confrontational
policies with prudent, balanced approaches to contentious issues holds
the possibility of creating the intellectual and political space for
compromise and the search for common ground.

#### Decline is [inevitable]{.underline}. Cling to [hard power]{.underline} through hegemony empower [revisionist axis]{.underline} AND risks [catastrophic]{.underline} nuclear war.

**Alonso-Trabanco '25** \[Jose Miguel; January 14; international
relations professional who holds a Master's Degree in Strategic
Intelligence and National Security, currently pursuing a PhD at Massey
University; Geopolitical Monitor, \"Illiberal Hegemony: The Tenets of a
Trump Foreign Policy,\"

Perhaps the [**greatest change** of direction in the world]{.underline}
Zeitgeist derived [from the [**second coming** of
Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} ---and probably the most consequential legacy
of his administration--- [is]{.underline} a prospective
[[**reformulation** of US **fo**]{.mark}reign
**[po]{.mark}**licy]{.underline}. Together, the popular legitimacy of
Trump's second mandate, the [lack of]{.underline} circumstantial
[political **constraints**]{.underline} associated with the quest for
re-election, and intense geopolitical convulsion [open a window of
**opportunity**]{.underline} to make this happen. Such a course of
action would be a departure from the inertial bipartisan trajectory
followed by the US for decades after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Many mainstream media commentators disqualify this hypothetical
possibility, often with contradictory criticisms.
**[Trump]{.underline}** is [portrayed as a **trigger-happy** incendiary
cowboy]{.underline} as a result of his supposed megalomania but, [at the
same time]{.underline}, he is also depicted as [an **irresponsible** and
cowardly **isolationist**]{.underline} eager [to follow]{.underline} the
metaphorical '[**ostrich** policy]{.underline}' or as the reincarnation
of Chamberlain because of his alleged proclivity for appeasement. [These
**misrepresentations** respond to]{.underline} the [lack of]{.underline}
an [appropriate interpretative **referential logic**]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is pertinent ---for diagnostic, predictive and
prescriptive purposes--- to [[overcome]{.mark} the
narrow-minded]{.underline} and [**Manichean** vision of [liberal
**internationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the explanatory
capabilities of theoretical models, such as political realism,
geoeconomics, and classical geopolitics. The purpose of this analysis is
to cover this gap in understanding by offering a higher degree of
clarity as an ingredient of a better judgment through a dispassionate
assessment. The [following contents]{.underline} intend to [dissect the
**cornerstones** of Trump foreign policy]{.underline}.

Illiberal Hegemony as Grand Strategy

As Kenneth [**Waltz** and]{.underline} John [**Mearsheimer**
forewarned]{.underline}, **[[unipolarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[proved to be an **[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**self-defeating**]{.mark} model]{.underline} of world order. The
[foreign policy implemented]{.underline} and championed [by
the]{.underline} so-called '[Beltway Blob]{.underline}' has [[delivered
**disastrous outcomes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most important of
which is the [configuration of]{.underline} a [strategic
environment]{.underline} that [[encouraged]{.mark} the **emergence** of
an **[axis of revisionist powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as
[Russia]{.underline}, [China]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline}, and ---to
a lesser extent--- North Korea. In turn, [states]{.underline} like
Brazil, Turkey, and Japan are [assertively reactivating [**imperial**
traditions]{.mark}]{.underline} that had remained dormant for a long
time. Furthermore, the [rampant **proliferation** of
[anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline} has [buried the promise of a **rules-based
order**]{.underline} for all intents and purposes.

The [world is witnessing the [**return** of **great power
rivalries**]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [proliferation of **[interstate
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}; a [high-tech **[arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}; irregular [[**proxy**
confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark}; the [outright violation of
territorial **[borders]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [intersection
between]{.underline} traditional and unconventional [**security**
threats]{.underline}; the operational [[irrelevance of]{.mark}
**international [institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [implosion of
**[failed states]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [normalization of
**military predation**]{.underline}; the [**weaponization**
of]{.underline} pretty much all vectors of [complex
interdependence]{.underline}; and the [resurrection of]{.underline}
militant **[[jihadism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, amongst other problematic
issues.

[Much of **Europe**]{.underline} ---whose security and defense has been
outsourced to the Americans through NATO's nuclear umbrella for
generations--- [is in [**disarray** due to]{.mark} internal [political
**upheaval**]{.mark}]{.underline}, strategic [atrophy]{.underline},
**[de-industrialization]{.underline}**, **[demographic]{.underline}**
trouble, [and]{.underline} a [loss of **economic
competitiveness**]{.underline}. Emerging states from the [[Global South
reclaim]{.underline}]{.mark} a [higher **hierarchical** [status]{.mark}
through **asymmetric** equalizers]{.underline}, force multipliers,
regional blocs, hedging strategies, and complex balanced alignments that
[increase]{.underline} their [influence as **independent participants**
in international politics]{.underline}. The [[new world
(dis)order]{.mark} resembles]{.underline} more a [[wild **Darwinian
jungle**]{.underline}]{.mark} than a peaceful Edenic garden.

As realists have long held, [**power** is the **only** valid currency
of]{.underline} the deadly arena of [international
politics]{.underline}. Despite the unwarranted illusions of the early
post-Cold War era, [today's **rude awakening**]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} the [unsavory truth that [**political power**
grows]{.mark}]{.underline} ---above all else--- out of the barrel of a
gun, the rest is pretty much commentary. Moreover, [the US [national
interest]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [[harmed by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**quixotic crusade** to [export]{.mark} the]{.underline} '**[end of
history]{.underline}**' --- [liberal
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [free market
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the American conception of
[**civil liberties** and post-modern [ideological
concoctions]{.mark}]{.underline} --- by force of arms. The [idea of
**[military interventions]{.mark}** to engage in]{.underline} 'nation
building' across the Greater [Middle East]{.underline} has
**[[backfired]{.underline}]{.mark}** by triggering chaos, sectarian
carnage and even 'imperial overstretch.' The proverbial road to hell has
been indeed [paved by **foolish policies** and **misguided
intentions**]{.underline}. Yet, [the twilight of]{.underline} '**[Pax
Americana]{.underline}**' [does not mean the demise of]{.underline} the
United States as a [great power]{.underline}.

Notwithstanding the objections of mainstream commentators, Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** ---judging in [accordance with the **tangible
results** of his first administration]{.underline}--- [is no
**warmonger**]{.underline}, dove, [or]{.underline}
**[isolationist]{.underline}**. To keep things in perspective, bear in
mind that [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} did [order the **targeted
assassination** of Iranian General]{.underline} Qassem Soleimani, though
he [did not engage]{.underline} Iran [in a **full-scale
war**]{.underline}, [despite]{.underline} his [**willingness** to
checkmate the Ayatollahs]{.underline}. Trump certainly [relies
on]{.underline} his trademark [**[strategic unpredictability]{.mark}**
as an asset **leveraged** to gain an upper hand]{.underline}. Yet the
facts on the ground -- his statements and the vision of key individuals
in his inner circle -- indicate that the second Trump administration
will [[follow]{.mark} of a [grand strategy of]{.mark}]{.underline}
'**[[illiberal hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**'.

Such a behavioral approach [reflects]{.underline} a [[**commitment** to
preserve]{.mark} **US [primacy]{.mark}** in the concert of]{.underline}
nations through [military]{.underline}, [economic]{.underline}, [and
technological **superiority**]{.underline}. It also [champions a **sober
path** which]{.underline} [favors]{.underline} '[peace through
strength]{.underline}' when it comes to [[securing]{.underline}]{.mark}
US **[[national interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[global **enforcement** of]{.mark}
collective **[rules]{.mark}** for]{.underline} the benefit of an
[illusory]{.underline} '**[[international
community]{.underline}]{.mark}**.' Tellingly, figures like J. D. Vance
and Tulsi Gabbard have been classified as opponents of neo-Wilsonian
hubris, who advocate a more realist Richelovian statecraft.

In a systemic strategic environment shaped by a polycentric balance of
power, '**[[America first]{.underline}]{.mark}**' means the United
States as the first amongst equals in the chessboard of high politics.
Apparently, it also [means the **dismissal** of perpetual **security**
guarantees for [states unwilling to invest]{.mark} in their [own
**defense**]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [burial of **permanent
entanglements** in]{.underline} contested [flashpoints]{.underline} half
the world away. Instead, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} and fellow
travelers [favor [**compartmentalized partnerships** driven by
**self-interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} on a case-by-case basis, as well
as [selective and **limited interventions** focused on priorities
for]{.underline} the US [national interest.]{.underline} Trump, aware of
the need for restraint, [does not intend to remake the world in
America's **image** and **likeness**]{.underline}. In this view
---[deeply [**skeptical** of]{.mark} American
**[exceptionalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}--- the United States is no
different than any other great power in history.

A prescription derived from this way of thinking is the
[**[pursuit]{.mark}** of]{.underline} transactional [**Faustian deals**
with other great powers so that rivalries [can be
**managed**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a manner [that does [not
undermine]{.mark} systemic **[strategic
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Clashing interests]{.underline} are
[a natural fact of political life]{.underline}, but there is no [need to
get [incinerated in]{.mark} a **[doomsday]{.mark}** scenario of
**[nuclear Armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [potential
**arrangement**]{.underline} could probably [take place
through]{.underline} the [negotiated redistribution]{.underline} of
spheres of influence [or]{.underline} the [**diplomatic conformation**
of]{.underline} an entente cordiale based on the pragmatic necessities
of **[realpolitik]{.underline}**. For example, the [Trump team intends
to [refocus]{.mark} the bandwidth of US foreign policy
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
seen as the world's major epicenter of geopolitical and economic
gravity. In this theatre, [the priority seems to be a policy towards
China that [combines]{.mark} elements of both [**deterrence** and
**containment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[not]{.mark} a direct
**[kinetic confrontation]{.mark}** that]{.underline} may
[[unleash]{.mark} nasty]{.underline} military [fallout]{.underline},
[**counterproductive** political effects and]{.underline} **[financial
bankruptcy]{.underline}**. The [costs]{.underline} and risks [of a
**Peloponnesian**-like **[hegemonic war]{.mark}**]{.underline} between
the United States and China [**outweigh** any potential
gains]{.underline}.

#### Try or die for transition. Else, extinction.

**Xing '25** \[Dr. Li; January 21; Yunshan leading scholar and a
distinguished professor at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies;
South China Morning Post, \"As the rules-based order declines, hegemony
takes on a new form,\"
https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3295126/rules-based-order-declines-hegemony-takes-new-form\]

History shows that [world orders]{.underline}, [disorders or new
orders]{.underline} often [result from]{.underline} the **[[disturbing
dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[unleashed]{.mark} by crises [amid the
**rise** of new powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the resistance of
existing powers. [Current dynamics]{.underline} can be understood by
analysing how the world order [is **[transitioning]{.mark}**
from]{.underline} a state of [**hegemony** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} one
of "[[**intertwined** hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}".

Hegemony is a concept that was employed by Italian Marxist theorist
Antonio Gramsci and is applied in international relations to describe
the enduring aspects of an existing order maintained by a leading actor
through a skilful combination of coercive and non-coercive power.

Hegemony is often associated with the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, which has [served as the **primary
hegemon**]{.underline} shaping the post-war order. US hegemony has been
[exerted through]{.underline} its [**economic** and **military
power**]{.underline}, as well as through [international]{.underline}
institutions used as tools to uphold global [norms]{.underline}, trade
and security structures.

However, [since **September 11** and]{.underline} 2008 [**g**lobal
**f**inancial **c**risis]{.underline}, the [[world
order]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[undergone]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple
crises and [[pivotal moments]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as [China's
rise]{.underline}, the US-China **[rivalry]{.underline}**, the [global
power **rebalance**]{.underline} caused [by
**[Covid]{.mark}**-19]{.underline}, the US [withdrawal from
**Afghanistan**]{.underline}, the
[Russia-**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} war, China's increasing role
in the Middle East, Israel's latest assault in [**[Palestine]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} Donald [[**Trump's** second term]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These crises and [pivotal moments]{.underline} have [[exposed
**vulnerabilities**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the existing world order and
challenged the [hegemony]{.underline} of Western-led institutions and
norms.

The existing world order is [facing [crises across]{.mark} four
key]{.underline} domains. **[[Multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [increasingly elusive due
to]{.underline} great power [rivalries and [interstate
**conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [highlighting]{.underline} a [crisis
of functionality]{.underline} as global institutions struggle [to build
consensus on]{.underline} critical issues, such as
**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** change, [[**pandemics** and
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [US-led]{.underline} "rules-based" **[[global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** architecture has [[shown]{.mark} its
[**inability** to]{.mark} effectively [address]{.mark}]{.underline}
worldwide [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}, reflecting a crisis of
scope. The [failure to deliver]{.underline} a secure and equitable
[global system underscores a [crisis of
**legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, [shifting **power
dynamics**]{.underline} between emerging and established powers
[signifies a crisis of **authority**]{.underline}.

In this context, [**intertwined** hegemony is a better way to
describe]{.underline} the **[[transition]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
current world order to an emerging one. Intertwined hegemony [reflects a
process [defined by **mutual challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[constraints]{.underline}, [dependencies and accommodation]{.underline}
between existing and emerging powers. Defenders and challengers of the
existing order are deeply intertwined, [engaging in a **continuous
process** of shaping and reshaping the global order]{.underline}.

Firstly, intertwined hegemony [indicates that **[globalisation]{.mark}**
is [steering the world]{.mark} economy [towards]{.mark}]{.underline} an
era of [multiple development models characterised by]{.underline} the
**[[coexistence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of multiple competing economic
systems and modes of governance. [Global economic players]{.underline}
now [include]{.underline} not only [private]{.underline} entities but
[also states]{.underline}, [exemplified by Chinese state-owned
enterprises]{.underline}.

The [Chinese **development model**]{.underline}, often referred to as
[the **[Beijing Consensus]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- understood as
[[regulated state-market-society]{.underline}]{.mark} relations --
[stands in contrast to the US-led **Washington Consensus**]{.underline}
defined by [liberal economic policies]{.underline}. [[**Non-state**
entities]{.underline}]{.mark} like transnational corporations, tech
giants and social movements [also play an **outsize role** in shaping
the world order]{.underline}.

Secondly, [intertwined hegemony [reflects]{.mark} a [shift
towards]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[**post-hegemonic**
world]{.underline}]{.mark}, where [[no single
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the US or the West more broadly,
[**unilaterally** [shapes global norms]{.mark}]{.underline} or
leadership. [[**Decentralised** platforms]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark}** connections, the [**digital
economy** and [**tech** competition]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[eroded]{.underline}]{.mark} [traditional
[monopolies]{.mark}]{.underline} on discourse, narratives and soft
power.

[[Global norms]{.underline}]{.mark} are [becoming more
**[flexible]{.mark}**]{.underline} and less universal, while
[**[alliances]{.mark}** increasingly]{.underline} form
[around]{.underline} [specific challenges]{.underline} and interests
rather than shared ideologies. In this post-hegemonic era, [no single
power can **enforce** global order]{.underline},
[[raising]{.underline}]{.mark} the risk of [regional [**conflicts**
and]{.mark} great power **[rivalries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Thirdly, [[intertwined hegemony emphasises]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[diverse perspectives]{.mark}** on mechanisms]{.underline}, policies
and strategies that drive national development and growth. Today,
[[emerging powers]{.mark} have the **capacity** to [formulate]{.mark}
collective **positioning strategies** and **[balancing
tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the global arena.

For example, the [expansion of **[Brics]{.mark}** promotes]{.underline}
a [more inclusive model of global governance]{.underline} that values
cultural and civilisational diversity, [[providing an **alternative**
to]{.mark} the **[universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} often espoused [by
the West]{.underline}.

The expansion of the [Brics grouping indicates]{.underline} that
[emerging powers are navigating]{.underline} the evolving world order
[[through]{.mark} a **[selective]{.mark} interplay** of
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}, including watching or observing
developments, [actively engaging in global affairs]{.underline},
[[bypassing **traditional** structures]{.underline}]{.mark} when
necessary and [influencing the **world system** to align with their
interests]{.underline}.

Last but not least, intertwined hegemony [marks a **[new era]{.mark}**
in which **stratification** between]{.underline} nations in the
traditional core, semi-periphery and periphery, [as well as the
**conventional** North-South axis]{.underline}, may [no longer fully
capture the [**complexities** of today's globalised]{.mark} and
interconnected [world]{.mark}]{.underline}. While they remain useful for
understanding global inequality and historical patterns of exploitation,
the [rise of]{.underline} emerging economies like [China]{.underline}
has [reshaped the established **structure** of global economic
**stratification**]{.underline}.

This is not the first time the [world order]{.underline} has
[encountered a **post-hegemonic** reality]{.underline}. Historical
transitions, such as the period following the fall of the Roman Empire
and the interwar years between the first and second world wars,
experienced similar phases of uncertainty and transformation.

The [[unprecedented pace of **technological**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[**economic** and **environmental** changes]{.underline}]{.mark} are
key distinctions in today's world. [[Whether]{.mark} these
transformations lead to a **new [equilibrium]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
devolve into [**chaos** depends]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} how global
actors **address** and **[navigate]{.mark}** these
challenges]{.underline}.

Therefore, [intertwined hegemony is]{.underline} perhaps [the **best
way** to describe evolving global dynamics]{.underline}, where power and
influence are increasingly shared, contested and co-produced across
different regions and actors.

The emerging world order characterised by intertwined hegemony [embodies
a **duality**]{.underline}. As existing powers gradually lose their
dominance, [emerging powers have [yet to establish]{.mark} an
**[alternative hegemony]{.mark}** grounded in universal **principles**
and **norms**]{.underline}.

### Multipolarity 

#### Multipolarity is inevitable, but clinging provokes [nuclear war]{.underline} 

Chris **Wright 23**, professor of history at the City University of New
York, Ph.D., 4/28/2023, \"The Second Cold War Is More Dangerous than the
First,\"
https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/04/28/the-second-cold-war-is-more-dangerous-than-the-first/

Modern history shows that [[the **most dangerous periods** are when
two]{.mark} or more [great powers are **struggling for
heg**]{.mark}]{.underline}emony. The eighteenth century in Europe was a
time of "multipolarity," as Britain, France, Prussia, Austria, and
Russia were almost continually at war, competing for geopolitical
advantage and to divide the continent between them. [The conflicts
escalated in the era of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, as a
mighty France]{.underline}, bursting with revolutionary energy,
[**strove** for **absolute dominance** against]{.underline}, in the end,
[Britain and Russia]{.underline}. The 1815 Congress of Vienna led to a
century-long balance of power presided over by an industrializing
Britain, which soon became the supreme world power. Once
industrialization swept the rest of Europe, however, particularly
Germany, Britain's power began to be challenged, not only in the
Scramble for Africa but in Europe itself. [German elites wanted their
country to be the next Britain, and to a great extent it was their
**desire for heg**emony that precipitated **both world
wars**]{.underline}. Since 1945, the United States has been virtually a
global hegemon. As John Ross notes in the recently published
Washington's New Cold War, even at the height of its relative economic
achievement in the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union's GDP was only 44 percent
of the U.S.'s. The Soviets had vast power in their limited sphere
encompassing Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but they were not a
capitalistically expansive, dynamically growing imperial power in the
mode of the United States---or, more recently, of a resurgent China.
[[China's]{.mark} GDP is 74 percent of the U.S.'s, and its [**growth
rate** is]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} ([it has grown **[seven times
faster]{.mark}** than the **America**n economy since 2007]{.underline}).
[[Measured by **purchasing power**]{.mark} parities, the U.S. accounts
for only **16 percent** of the world economy, and [China's economy
is]{.mark} 18 percent **[larger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, for
the first time since World War II, [we are entering an era of real
competition between two mammoth economies, a declining hegemon and an
aspiring hegemon.]{.underline} When people talk about "the China
threat," this is, in effect, all they mean. In the long run, China poses
a greater threat to U.S. power than the Soviet Union ever did.
Mainstream commentators and politicians prate about China's threat to
democratic values and human rights---there always has to be an
ideological rationalization for geopolitical strategy---but [U.S.
foreign and domestic policy]{.underline} since the Second World War
[tells us how much its elites care about democracy and human rights.
From]{.underline} the **[Vietnam]{.underline}** War [to]{.underline} the
catastrophic invasion of **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} from
[U.S. support for]{.underline} thugs like **[Batista]{.underline}**,

and attempted coups [against **countless governments**]{.underline}, it
is self-evident that [policymakers care little about the moral values
they pretend to espouse.]{.underline} Americans have to ask themselves:
[[is it worth]{.mark} **risking nuclear war**---and]{.underline} an
**[[apocalyptic nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for no loftier
purpose than [[to maintain their]{.underline}]{.mark} country's
[**violently enforced [grasp]{.mark}** [of **overwhelming**]{.mark}
**global [power]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Threats to U.S. Power The
current flashpoint, of course, is the war in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[is helping]{.mark} to
midwife [a]{.mark} "**[partnership]{.mark}**" [between China and
Russia]{.mark}, both of [which are]{.mark} also
**[deepening]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[**ties** with
**Iran**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Decades ago, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote
that "a coalition allying Russia with both China and Iran can develop
only if [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is shortsighted
enough to **antagonize China** and **Iran**
**simultaneously**]{.underline}." He would presumably not be very happy
with [U.S. policies]{.underline} that [are bringing about]{.underline}
exactly [this coalition]{.underline}. At the same time, U.S. [missteps
in the Middle East and]{.underline} its relative
[disengagement]{.underline} from the region since the Obama presidency
[are **allow**ing China to improve its position there, as illustrated by
the deal it]{.underline} recently [brokered between Iran and
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [to normalize relations]{.underline}. China's
burgeoning economic interests not only in the Middle East but across
most of the world, a function of its colossal, globe-spanning Belt and
Road Initiative, require the country to play an ever-greater diplomatic
role in fraught regions. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, for its part, [has
shown it is happy to defy Washington, even]{.underline} joining much of
the world in [disregarding]{.underline} Western [sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}. While [Washington's **failure** to convince most
countries to]{.underline} economically and diplomatically [**isolate
Russia** highlights the U.S.'s declining]{.underline}
"**[heg]{.underline}**emony," [the real **threats** to American
power]{.underline} [**run deeper** than **diplomatic
embarrassments**]{.underline}. In coming years, [the]{.underline} very
[status of the dollar as the world's dominant currency may be
threatened]{.underline}. A kind of "**[de-dollarization]{.underline}**"
[has been happening]{.underline} for some time now, as, for example,
[the share of **dollar reserves** held by central banks declined from 71
percent]{.underline} in 1999 [to **59** percent]{.underline} in 2021.
[But]{.underline} in the last few years, and especially
[since]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine, the]{.underline}
ongoing [effort]{.underline} by many countries [to undermine the
dollar's dominance of the global financial system has
**intensified**]{.underline}. In part, [this is because of the U.S.'s
"**weaponization**" of the dollar]{.underline}: in the recent past,
Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan, and Russia have all suffered from
financial and trade sanctions that have included even freezing overseas
assets and removal from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins the
world's financial infrastructure. [Other countries]{.underline},
understandably [worried about suffering the same fate, share Russia's
interest in developing **new financial institutions**]{.underline} and
networks [outside of the U.S.-led system]{.underline}. Apart from this
motivation, they simply want to reduce their exposure to the effects of
U.S. economic and monetary policy, which can devastate economies. And
[as China rises, it makes sense for it to promote use of the
renminbi]{.underline}, or at least non-dollar currencies. To that end,
[the BRICS countries]{.underline}, for instance, [have been establishing
[new institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} and market mechanisms [to
[**bypass** the dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}, and are even exploring the
possibility of creating a new reserve currency based on the BRICS basket
of currencies. [Institutions like [the **N**]{.mark}ew

to]{.underline} partially [de-dollarize the]{.underline} global [oil
trade all point toward a future currency regime]{.underline} that is at
least multilateral, if not bilateral. The economist Nouriel Roubini
argues that, "in a world that will be increasingly divided into two
geopolitical spheres of influence," [a bilateral currency regime is
likely to emerge]{.underline}, perhaps in the next decade. [Given

as two experts note, Washington can hardly be viewing all these
developments with equanimity. Loss of the dollar's status as the world's
reserve currency would have severe consequences for the American
economy. But this outcome is exactly the end-goal of Washington's
bellicose policies toward its perceived rivals! [[Through]{.mark}

The strategic **[[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}** regime---which
provides the foundation for global stability between the world's two
largest nuclear powers---[[is in **jeopardy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
during the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union [were able to
avoid **nuclear** confrontation by]{.underline} maintaining [reliable
**[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline} channels, routine [diplomatic
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} on arms control,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} establishing mutually agreed
[[safeguards]{.mark} to [avoid **escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
clashes [beyond]{.underline} a given threshold, [**accidents**, or
misperception.]{.underline} The experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis
that brought the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear
war heightened appreciation for the importance of cultivating a robust
nuclear arms control regime to deter U.S. and Soviet/Russian leadership
from resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. Since the 1970s, the
Soviet Union/Russia and the United States have concluded a series of
strategic arms agreements ensuring transparency and reliable mutual
verification protocols. Along with introducing transformational reforms
of glasnost and perestroika on the domestic front, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was able to accomplish tremendous strides working with U.S.
President Ronald Reagan to achieve major bilateral nuclear arms
reductions. The fact that many fewer nations have acquired nuclear
capabilities and the international community avoided clashes involving
the use of nuclear weapons must be attributed for the most part to the
stable core foundations of the U.S.-Soviet/Russia nuclear security
regime. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) that was set to
expire in 2026 has been halted. Russia's war in Ukraine and its severing
of relationships with the United States and its Western allies and the
collapse of U.S.-Russian strategic dialogue and engagement on arms
control, coupled with China's accelerated drive toward nuclear expansion
and escalating tensions in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, have
ushered in a new period of instability and risk for arms control and
proliferation. U.S. President Joe Biden has acknowledged that
[[we]{.mark} have [reached an]{.mark} "**[inflection point]{.mark}**"
that]{.underline} will [determine]{.underline} the [future
**security**]{.underline} for our allies and partners and the world
community for decades ahead, but the circumstances require careful
assessment of strategic options and consequences of policy choices.
[Innovative [**approaches** will]{.mark}]{.underline} be required to
[[prevent]{.mark} catastrophic [**nuclear escalation** and
**prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline} of weapons of mass destruction
[as the world system transitions from]{.underline} an era of bipolar
[nuclear stability]{.underline} to a more comartifiplex three major
power nuclear configuration. Ukraine War, Derailing U.S.-Russia
Strategic Nuclear Collaboration, Risk of Nuclear Response In the past,
it has been the expectation that the United States and Soviet
Union/Russia could compartmentalize differences to prevent other
contentious issues in the bilateral relationship from interfering with
the critical areas of nuclear security and arms control. However, the
fact that Ukraine has been defined as an "existential" security priority
for Russia's leadership suggests that it is no longer a safe assumption
that Moscow will separate clashes on Ukraine from collaboration with the
United States on nuclear security. While the United States and the
Soviet Union/Russia were able to manage competition and differences in
the past on Angola, Ethiopia, Central America, Afghanistan, and, more
recently ,in the Middle East (Iraq, Libya, Syria) without undermining
strategic arms control, Ukraine's location bordering the Russian
Federation with a large Russian-speaking population and extensive
historical, cultural, and geostrategic ties elevates its importance to a
level of being associated by Russia's leadership with survival of the
state. In January 2023, the U.S. State Department reported that it was
no longer possible to verify that Russia was complying with New START
due to the Kremlin's unwillingness to allow for on-site inspections.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to suspend New
START in February 2023, linking resumption of the treaty with an end to
Western military support for Ukraine. The Biden administration responded
by expressing interest in engaging Russia to manage nuclear risks and
develop a post-2026 arms control framework. While Kremlin spokesperson
Dmitri Peskov described the suggestion of the U.S. administration as
"important and positive," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov
reiterated that **[[unless]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and the West as a whole [do not
radically **[revise]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[anti-Russian
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}...productive negotiations on [[arms
control]{.mark} will **[hardly]{.mark}** be
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[**Although** Russia has]{.mark} a
**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se nuclear policy, since unleashing the
"special military operation" in Ukraine in February 2022,
[[Putin]{.mark} has [not ruled out]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the event
that the survival of the Russian Federation was threatened. For Putin,
Russia's territory includes those areas annexed from Ukraine since 2014
(Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia). At the time of
launching Russia's incursion into Ukraine, Putin placed Russia's nuclear
forces on alert and warned that those interfering with Russia's
operation in Ukraine would face consequences on a scale "you have never
seen in your entire history." In September 2022, after annexing four
Ukrainian oblasts to Russia, Putin stated, "[In the]{.underline} event
of a [**threat** to]{.underline} the [territorial integrity]{.underline}
of our country [and to **defend Russia**]{.underline} and our people,
[we will]{.underline} certainly [**make use** of all weapon
systems]{.underline} available to us. This is not a bluff." Russia's
military forces seized control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
which is the largest in Europe early on in the war generating concerns
about possible nuclear disaster. In March 2023, Putin announced that
[Russia would station **t**]{.underline}actical
**[n]{.underline}**uclear **[w]{.underline}**eapon**[s]{.underline}** in
Belarus contending this was [no different than]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[positioning nuclear assets among]{.underline} allied nations in
[Europe]{.underline}. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>. Putin's
remarks at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum in July 2023 seemed to dial
back concerns about nuclear responses in Ukraine. Putin justified moving
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus as an "element of deterrence" for
those "thinking about inflicting strategic defeat" of Russia. Following
recounting setbacks in Ukraine's counteroffensive, Putin reiterated that
Russia's official doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in
situations where the survival of the nation was threatened but then
implied that this option was not necessary at this point. In mid-August
2023, the United States announced approval for the Netherlands and
Denmark to provide F16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Russia has been targeted
with a series of drone strikes on military installations and buildings
in civilian areas over the past months attributed to Ukrainians
operating within the Russian Federation. Following announcement in
August 2023 that the Biden administration would provide the 45 tranche
of military assistance in Ukraine, including additional ammunition for
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and anti-armor
rockets, Hydra 70 rockets, and 3 million rounds of small arms
ammunition, the head of Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS Yuri Borisov
stated that the Sarmat MIRV equipped intercontinental ballistic missile
had been placed into service---a weapon that Putin had said would make
Moscow's enemies "think twice." Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security
Council Dmitry Medvedev has issued periodic warnings about a nuclear
scenario stating that "loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can
provoke the outbreak of nuclear war" and that Russia may be forced to
use a nuclear weapon if Ukraine's counteroffensive succeeds. On August
28, 2023, Medvedev posted on Telegram that Ukraine's approval from
Western nations for missile strikes throughout Russia or to attack
Crimea unfortunately indicates that the "prophecies of the Apocalypse"
were closer. Statements from Russia's leadership on willingness to
resort to the use of nuclear weapons over Ukraine have been echoed by
discussions taking place among leading defense experts. Sergei
Karaganov, former presidential advisor and dean of the Higher School of
Economics in Moscow, published an article in June 2023 calling for
Russia to undertake preemptive nuclear strikes against several European
countries as a way to end the war in Ukraine. While Karaganov
acknowledged that this would be a "terrible choice" on a moral level, he
contends that it is necessary to prevent the West from leading the world
to a final "full-scale" and "last world war for humanity.\" Karaganov's
article prompted a series of responses among other leading analysts of
Russia's foreign policy community contending that employing a nuclear
strike would not "sober up the West" or that Karaganov's position
"underestimates the willingness of Western elites' determination to
climb the escalation ladder with Russia, and, if necessary ahead of
it\..."Former head of the Carnegie Moscow Center Dmitry Trenin affirmed
that nuclear weapons have been "on the table" from the outset and that
basing U.S. strategy on the "belief that the Russian leadership will not
dare use nuclear weapons in the current conflict" was an "extremely
dangerous misperception." Russia's channel 1 and other state-sponsored
media networks have hosted programs with pundits, analysts, and
legislative leaders calling for nuclear responses over Ukraine. U.S.
President Biden cautioned at the outset of the Ukraine conflict that a
direct U.S.-Russia war must be avoided because of nuclear risks. In
October 2022, Biden warned that the risk of nuclear "armageddon" was the
highest it had been since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Biden has said
that there was no way to use tactical nuclear weapons on a battlefield
without it ending in Armageddon. In June 2023, he stated that the threat
issued by Putin to use nuclear weapons was "real" and that deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was "absolutely irresponsible." U.S.
officials have warned of "catastrophic consequences" for nuclear use,
but Biden has remained ambiguous in spelling out scenarios and likely
U.S. responses, which have traditionally been essential for deterrence.
Several analysts have tended to downplay threats of the use of nuclear
weapons coming from Moscow as "bluffing," but others have not dismissed
the possibility or even certainty. Although Putin has referenced the
doctrinal foundation and taken steps to prepare for employing a nuclear
response, he must weigh the consequences in loss of life, destruction of
the environment and infrastructure, and damage to existing significant
international partnerships. China, India, and other valuable partner
nations for Russia have emphasized that nuclear weapons should not be
used in the Ukraine war. There are options available to Russia in the
conventional, cyber, or other domains that would not entail the costs of
using nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is a high risk that the
war in Ukraine could escalate involving neighboring nations evoking an
Article V response from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the potential for unleashing a nuclear response should not be ruled
out. The longer the war in Ukraine continues the greater the risk of
miscalculation and accidents that could result in a nuclear
confrontation. Russia had supported Washington and Beijing in containing
North Korea's nuclear development, but the fact that Putin has turned to
Kim Jong-un as a source for ammunition for the Ukraine war with the
prospect for Russia-North Korea cooperation in the nuclear sphere
represents a setback for managing nuclear security and proliferation.
Russia's military cooperation with Iran in the wake of the war in
Ukraine with Tehran providing lethal drone technology and Moscow
offering diplomatic support to Iran poses further complications for
nuclear safeguard compliance. The suspension of the U.S.-Russia New
START, threats of resorting to the use of nuclear weapons and shifting
geopolitical alignments resulting from clashes over Ukraine has
destabilized the global nuclear security order. The issue of perhaps
highest priority on the U.S.-Russia security agenda, ongoing
collaboration among the two nations holding the world's largest nuclear
arsenals, is now in question. NATO Enlargement, Failed Diplomacy, Costs
and Risks of Military Engagement \<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>. Moscow's
invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine has come at enormous cost,
but [the **West**]{.underline} also [[made]{.mark} strategic
**[choices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [contributed to **[provoking
conflict]{.mark}** with Russia. [Russia's]{.mark}
leadership]{.underline}, defense, [and]{.underline} foreign policy
[community]{.underline} [**[consistently]{.underline}** [expressed
**opposition** to expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Western security
alliance. George F. Kennan, architect of America's post-World War II
Soviet containment strategy, had warned that expansion of NATO would be
"[the most **fateful error** of American policy]{.underline} in the
entire post-Cold War era." Moscow tolerated the first rounds of NATO
enlargement in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, but claimed that NATO's
military involvement in Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO crossed a
line constituting a serious immediate and long-term potential threat to
Russia. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\> Moscow's leadership had
broached proposals to develop a European security architecture that
would take account of Russia's interests. In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev, then
serving as president of the Russian Federation, advanced a proposal for
a new European security order followed by additional proposals prior to
the invasion of Ukraine that were not afforded serious consideration
among Western nations. Suggestions in the aftermath of the unraveling of
the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact that NATO was dead or had no purpose
were unfounded. NATO provided a platform for bringing nations together
to strengthen capacity for addressing a broad range of significant
security challenges including promoting collaboration in managing
weapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism, cyber and maritime
cooperation, providing disaster support, and much more. Together with
the EU, NATO offered assistance to Soviet successor nations in Europe
and Eurasia for democratic reform, defense transformation, and capacity
building. The NATO-Russia Council fostered practical security
cooperation and consultation until Moscow's annexation of Crimea in
2014, but, for Russians, NATO enlargement was considered a betrayal of
pledges on the part of the United States and its allies that NATO would
not expand and the possibility of Ukraine engaging in military
collaboration with the Western security alliance or Ukraine joining NATO
became a defining red-line for the Kremlin. The reality is that Ukraine
was not a likely candidate for NATO membership in the foreseeable
future, but Western involvement in the Euro-Maidan uprising that
contributed to unseating Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor
Yanukovych prompted Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The collapse of the
Minsk peace process and lack of commitment in finding a workable
diplomatic solution for resolving differences between Kyiv and Moscow on
Crimea and Russian-speaking communities in Donbas escalated into the
devastating war witnessed today. The disclosure by former German
Chancellor Angela Merkel revealing that Germany and other Western
nations were not sincere about reaching a diplomatic settlement between
Russia and Ukraine, but only sought to gain time for Ukraine to enhance
NATO military collaboration and presence in Ukraine has done nothing to
enlist confidence that a diplomatic settlement would be possible. The
Russia-Ukraine war has cost thousands of lives, displaced much of the
Ukrainian population, destabilized the European and Eurasian security
and economic orders, and disrupted global energy and food supplies. Had
Ukraine been willing to forego NATO membership remaining neutral, this
war would likely have been averted. Dedicated commitment on the part of
all involved to pursue diplomatic channels toward developing alternative
approaches for the post-Cold War European security structure would
certainly have been preferable to suffering the tragic losses in
Ukraine. There is no reason that Ukraine should not have been able to
maintain ties with Russia and other Eastern European neighbors while
simultaneously benefitting from cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic
community. Moscow's leadership contends that this is not simply a
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that the West wants to destroy
Russia. The perception that the West seeks strategic defeat of the
Russian state is not unfounded. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's
public statement that the United States intends to "weaken Russia" by
providing military support to Ukraine and frequent comments on prospects
for regime change in Moscow by Western policy officials and analysts
reinforces the Kremlin's assessments regarding U.S./Western intentions.
Any strategy aimed to destabilize and drive a major world nuclear power
into a rogue nation status is obviously misguided and dangerous. Russia
is still a European power and stabilizing Moscow's relationships with
nations of the transatlantic community will remain consequential for
European and wider global security. Ukraine's most recent June 2023
counteroffensive has been unsuccessful and it should be understood that
Ukraine can not win a war with a much larger committed nuclear power.
Anticipating the difficulties ahead for the Ukrainian military in
re-taking occupied territories, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley had said in late 2022 after successes in Kharkiv and Kherson
that it might be time to consider entering into discussions on a
political settlement. This suggestion was widely rejected, and the Biden
administration has been clear that decisions on ending the war in
Ukraine would rest with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and the
Ukrainian population. However, the setbacks in Ukraine's most recent
June 2023 counteroffensive has generated consideration among some in the
administration about the need for an exit strategy. The current period
of geopolitical upheaval in Europe and Eurasia is fraught with risks and
at a minimum it will be important for the United States and its allies
to support Ukraine in re-building and to stabilize relationships with
Russia in order to prevent a wider Russia-NATO or world war. It is
important to recognize that a consequence of the choices that have been
made over Ukraine present major obstacles for continuation of a central
U.S. security priority that has ensured global stability over the past
decades, the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms regime. If the war in Ukraine
continues to grind on for years or becomes a "forever war," the
prospects for negotiating a new START agreement before it expires in
2026 may be over, ending an era of cooperation in arms control and
proliferation. This should be a major motivating factor for resuming
dialogue and diplomacy toward ending the war in Ukraine avoiding further
loss of life and devastation and setting a foundation for a return to
normalcy in managing nuclear arms and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. \<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>
**[[Russia-China]{.underline}]{.mark}** Strategic Partnership and
Prospects for Tripartite Major Power Nuclear Engagement Although the
history of the Sino-Russian relationship has not been without clashes,
[the two countries have become]{.underline} more [closely
**aligned**]{.underline} over the past decade forging a burgeoning
"strategic partnership" [described]{.underline} by Russia's President
Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping [as a "partnership
without limits."]{.underline} Following escalation of tensions with the
West over Russia's annexation of Crimea, Moscow moved to further
strengthen its relationship with Beijing. Moscow continued to turn to
China to offset stringent economic sanctions imposed by the United
States and its European allies in response to Russia's military
incursion in Ukraine. Beijing attributes the Russo-Ukraine war to
Western meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics and NATO's tendency to
remain locked in a Cold War mindset insisting on expansion of the
alliance. [Russia and China [find]{.mark} **common
[ground]{.mark}**]{.underline} in [[resisting]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
global [**hegemony** and challenging [American
**leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the rules-based liberal
international order. **[[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} believe that they [[should be **entitled**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[greater **influence**]{.mark} in shaping
world order]{.underline} in the contemporary multipolar system. Though
the two countries no longer share ideological affinity, both Vladimir
Putin and Xi Jinping are concerned about protecting security of the
state and have been united in opposing Western intervention to advance
democracy which they contend has resulted in chaos and destabilizing
societies. Moscow and Beijing want to ensure that the kind of domestic
turmoil that fueled the color revolutions in Eurasia and upheavals in
the Middle East will never pose threats of regime change in their
respective nations. Cultivation of relationships on the part of Russia
and China with nations of the Global South is another means of
counterbalancing the influence of the United States and its Western
allies. Both countries issue narratives emphasizing legacies of Western
imperialism, moral decadence, and claims of exceptionalism invoking
calls for respecting the diversity of world civilizations and
traditions. Offering investment without imposing domestic requirements
has contributed to China surpassing U.S. economic presence throughout
much of the world. The significant expansion of numbers of nations that
would like to join BRICS threatens the preeminence of U.S. currency and
influence in global finance and economic development over the long term.
[Russia and China]{.underline} have [**[expanded]{.mark}**
military-to-military [**cooperation** and]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[held]{.underline} routine [large-scale military
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 2018 [[in **Asia**, the
**Baltics**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Mediterranean]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [Russia]{.underline} has
[sold]{.underline} some of its most [advanced]{.underline} military
[equipment to China]{.underline}. While China's economy far exceeds that
of Russia, Russia as one of the world's two largest nuclear powers can
offer support to China in accelerating nuclear development. During the
visit of Xi Jinping to Russia in March 2023, [Putin
announced]{.underline} that Russia's state atomic energy corporation
Rosatom and China's Atomic Energy Agency had entered into a long-term
contract that would include [[exporting **plutonium**]{.mark} from
Russia to China]{.underline} for use in nuclear reactors potentially
[[contributing to]{.underline}]{.mark} more [rapid [**expansion**
of]{.mark} China's [nuclear **arsenal**]{.mark}. [China and
Russia]{.mark} do **not** yet have]{.underline} an
"**[alliance]{.underline}**," [but]{.underline} the two countries have
been [[driven **closer** as]{.mark} a [result of
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States. While the conflict
over Ukraine has led to collapse of the initial post-Soviet
rapprochement between the United States and Russia, [the
U.S.-China]{.underline} bilateral [[**relationship**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[strained over
**Taiwan**]{.underline},]{.mark} competition for [influence in [the
**S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea and wider Asia, economic reprisals in
[the tech]{.underline}nology [sphere]{.underline}, and more. The
Russia-China strategic partnership has advanced too far to hope that the
United States would be able to drive a wedge between the two countries.
The Biden administration's identification of the struggle between
democracy and autocracy as the guiding vision for [American foreign
policy]{.underline} presents additional difficulties for enlisting
cooperation in nuclear security and other critical areas or to avoid
[**uniting** Russia and China]{.underline} against American interests.
In considering approaches to arms control in the current conflictual and
rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances, U.S. policy officials
should understand that both Moscow and Beijing will expect an equal say
in setting terms for engagement. Major regional concerns for both
countries including Ukraine for Russia and Taiwan for China stand as
impediments to advancing cooperation in nuclear security. Toward a
Tripartite Nuclear Framework for the 21st Century Global Security
Environment Concepts for policies of the past that were effective in
containing geopolitical and ideological clashes among nuclear rivals
such as "peaceful coexistence" and "détente" or aspirations for building
U.S.-Russian "strategic partnership" in the early post-Soviet period no
longer exist. [There is much **greater focus**]{.underline} today
[on]{.underline} what is perceived as inevitable peer or near-peer
[major power **confrontation** rather than considering ways
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline} of different historical experience,
cultures, values, and core interests [[might]{.underline}]{.mark}
co-exist and [**[cooperate]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[ensure]{.underline} strategic [security]{.underline}. [**Policymakers**
of]{.underline} the [three nations **[confront]{.mark}**]{.underline} an
emerging global security environment that is more daunting not only
because of [**transition** from a bipolar to a **tripolar**
major]{.underline} power [nuclear order]{.underline}, but also because
protecting nuclear security has become more problematic because of [new
developments in]{.underline} areas such [as [**space**, **cyber**, or
**a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence.]{.underline} If the
United States and Russia are not able to establish a framework for
continued collaboration in arms control after the expiration of START in
2026 and China is not engaged in nuclear arms control, [the global
**community** will face]{.underline} unprecedented circumstances of
[unconstrained **nuclear** arms **competition**]{.underline}. Beijing is
on track to have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 and has been exceeding
predictions in terms of the pace of development in nuclear capacity, but
China has traditionally been unwilling to participate in arms control
believing that this would only provide advantages to nations with much
larger nuclear arsenals. While the prospects for forging a tripartite
nuclear regime appear quite limited in the current
geopolitical/strategic circumstances, it is simply too important for
global security not to make every effort to preserve longstanding
cooperation with Russia in arms control and proliferation and to foster
nuclear security cooperation with Beijing. Prior to the Ukraine war, we
suggested that the U.S. administration might boldly propose a tripartite
security dialogue with Russia and China to manage nuclear challenges and
other security issues of shared concern. This approach would underscore
U.S. recognition of the major power status of both countries and the
importance of engaging in a constructive and pragmatic spirit to address
issues impacting citizens of all three countries and the world
community. The U.S. administration should understand the risks of
driving Russia and China closer and explore ways to engage with both
countries so as to diffuse the perception that the United States sees no
alternative to future major power war. In the past, relationships among
Presidents have been pivotal in advancing the U.S.-Soviet/Russia arms
control agenda. The fact that the U.S. and Russian presidents do not
communicate and China's president has been reluctant to meet with the
U.S. president presents a major obstacle for advancing an arms control
agenda. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China in June
2023 was promising in terms of generating dialogue on the U.S.-China
bilateral agenda, but Biden's reference to Xi as a "dictator" upon
Blinken's return from China elicited angry reactions from Beijing.
Presuming that it might be possible to resume dialogue and negotiations
on nuclear security at some point, it would of course be important to
approach discussions with realistic aspirations and low expectations.
This is a process that will require highly skilled diplomats with
commitment, patience, and capacity to recognize the stakes and risks of
failure. All parties must appreciate that there is no winning a war
among nuclear powers and the United States, Russia, and China would
benefit by strengthening commitment to exhausting all diplomatic options
for avoiding conflict and rapid termination of kinetic clashes. Pledges
like "fighting until the last Ukrainian" or promulgating protracted wars
will not bode well for nuclear arms control and avoiding catastrophic
loss of life that should be unacceptable to all. Engaging in discussions
on crisis avoidance, crisis management, and implementing safeguards to
prevent misperceptions that could result in nuclear use would be obvious
priorities. Reliable communication channels among the three nations will
be essential for managing clashes and ensuring that intentions are clear
in any crisis situation. In current circumstances in which nuclear
threats have been issued over the conflict in Ukraine, [[the **risk**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a [regional conflict [**escalating** to
nuclear]{.mark} use]{.underline} should be clear. Perhaps considering a
tripartite no first-use option would provide an objective that the three
nations could work to accomplish. Recent serious U.S. bilateral clashes
with both Russia and China only underscore the importance for
continually reviewing arms control and deterrence strategies to adjust
to rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances. Entering into dialogue
on nuclear security would help the three parties to gain better
understanding of the capabilities and intentions of the others. Russia
has agreed to abide by the New START limits on numbers of deployed
long-range nuclear forces. The United States and Russia might consider
agreeing to reductions in order to incentivize China's cooperation.
Destabilization of major nuclear power collaboration will undermine
successes of the nuclear non-proliferation regime as several nations
will only be more determined to acquire nuclear capacity in response to
changing and strained geopolitical circumstances. In the past, although
the United States has been able to collaborate with Russia and China on
issues such as engaging Iran in nuclear negotiations, reigning in the
North Korean nuclear threat, and achieving successes in nuclear
nonproliferation, [the risk of uncontrolled
**proliferation**]{.underline} among both state and non-state actors
[[will only **increase**]{.mark} if the three countries are not able to
manage]{.underline} geopolitical [strains]{.underline}. Given the
[**longstanding** U.S.-Soviet/Russia **experience** and prior
**successes** in nuclear arms control]{.underline}, it would be wise to
build on this foundation and experience [while **reaching** out to bring
**China**]{.underline} into a major nuclear power triad. Simultaneously,
it would be important to [strengthen multilateral
negotiations]{.underline} in nuclear security among P5 countries while
perhaps broadening dialogue with other nuclear nations regarding
safeguards necessary for developments in artificial intelligence and
other areas. These measures toward preventing a nuclear arms race,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and avoiding nuclear first
use will certainly be difficult to implement at this juncture. However,
such steps would serve the interests of the United States, Russia, and
China and [**enhance** security of the global **community**]{.underline}
and should be among the highest priorities for the world's leading
nuclear powers.

However, over a period of time starting roughly from the turn of the
millennium, the painfully crafted [**[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline} (NAC) [instruments
have been **withering**]{.underline} away. In fact, the [US and Russia
currently [stand at]{.mark} the **delicate [threshold]{.mark}** where
their bilateral nuclear arms control is [held]{.mark} together
[by]{.mark} the **slender [thread]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **only** the
**[New START]{.mark}** Treaty. [This]{.mark} too [could
**snap**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021 unless the two sides agree to
extend the treaty. Signs of this happening at the time of this writing
appear quite unclear. On the other hand, [what looks **absolutely
clear** is]{.underline} the rather [**grim** nuclear arms control
scenario [as]{.mark} **old [mechanisms]{.mark}** [fade out]{.mark} and
**no new ones** are in sight]{.underline}. USA and Russia are going
through a low phase in their relationship and neither is showing any
interest in engaging on nuclear issues. Meanwhile, the number of nuclear
players has increased from only these two. Multiple [nuclear
dyads]{.underline} ([[**US**-**Russia**]{.mark}, US-**[China]{.mark}**,
US-[**DPRK**, **China-India**,]{.mark}
**India-[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [and the
**[spillover]{.mark}** of developments in capability taking place in
each dyad onto the other, [creating]{.mark} nuclear **[chain
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is a new phenomenon. To further
exacerbate the situation, [**[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies are
**[threatening]{.mark}** to intersect]{.underline} with nuclear
deterrence [[in novel ways]{.mark} and **none** of the]{.underline}
nuclear armed [states is showing **any inclination** to
manage]{.underline} these develop- ments or even acknowledge the need
for doing so. Lastly, a further complication is being created by the
re-emergence of old ideas, such as those of low yield weapons for
nuclear war fighting, or of limited nuclear war. These concepts had long
ago been abandoned as unfeasible and dangerous, but they seem to be
staging a comeback into nuclear doctrines. The [result]{.underline} of
all these developments [is a complex and **extremely stressed** global
**nuclear conundrum**]{.underline} with severe regional implications.
New Delhi is one capital that has traditionally been far away from the
world of arms control. As a non-nuclear weapons possessor until 1998,
and as a country that actively campaigned for the complete elimination
of nuclear weapons as a way of safeguarding its national security, India
considered bilateral NAC between the US and USSR/Russia as one way,
though not necessarily an optimal way, of eventually moving towards
nuclear disarmament. It was perceived as a mechanism that had a largely
bilateral significance but which, never- theless, helped reduce nuclear
risks, arrested the offence-defence cycle and hence had a benign
influence on international security. However, New Delhi was always
conscious of the fact that China, whose nuclear capability impinged on
its security, was not party to any such controls. Yet, the hope was
sustained that the nuclear threat from China would be addressed through
universal nuclear disarmament, realised through the Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT). This hope, however, was dashed when the NPT was granted an
indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. Meanwhile, around the
same time, pressures on India to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) as a non-nuclear weapon state increased. Keeping its security
compulsions in view, India felt pressured to demonstrate its own nuclear
weapons capability and establish nuclear deterrence. But, in the
process, India's faith in the ability of bilateral arms control or
multilateral non-proliferation instruments to attain nuclear disarmament
was lost. Since the possession of nuclear weapons, [[India]{.mark} is
**more [awake]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the more realistic
utility of [**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol
as an arms race **management** instrument]{.underline} or a risk
reduction instrument. It is for this reason that the [**ongoing**
[developments]{.mark} in NAC should **[matter]{.mark}** for India, [even
if these are]{.mark} taking place [in]{.mark} the **US-[Russia]{.mark}**
[bilateral]{.mark} **[domain]{.mark}**. They do impact the global
**nuclear order**, will have implications for **China**, and thereby
also on **India**]{.underline}. Whether the future trajectory of NAC
will result in positive consequences or adverse ones for New Delhi will
depend on many factors, including how these are handled. This article
highlights four main issues that will have implications at the global
and regional levels, for India in particular. Loss of an NAC model [The
**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline}
arrangements [[between]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
USSR/**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most of which were underwritten
by verification mechanisms, [[presented]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves
as [a [**template** for others]{.mark} to **follow**. They could be
described as a **model**]{.underline} (even if less than adequate from
the disarmament point of view) [or an **anchor** of successful arms race
**management**]{.underline} and their effective implementation [provided
an [**incentive** for other]{.mark} **nuclear [dyads]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}to adopt and adapt]{.underline}. In the current circumstances,
however, the abandonment of most of these bilateral treaties has led to
the loss of an example or mould of nuclear arms control that could have
been used bilaterally or multilaterally. While a copy of the written
text of the agreement would, of course, be always available, [the
**spirit** seems **lost**]{.underline}. The historical experience of how
to arrive at such agreements in an atmosphere of deep mistrust would be
lost eventually too, [as the **habit** of nuclear engagement **fades
away** in the case of US and Russia]{.underline}, even before it has
been born in the case of other nuclear dyads. Therefore, [despite all
its **imperfections**, the NAC]{.underline} architecture [was a
**framework** whose loss will have **implications** for international
**security**]{.underline}. Presence of Nuclear Cacophony [The
[**vacuum** created by]{.mark} the [loss]{.mark} of NAC has been [filled
by]{.mark} an atmosphere of 'free for all' or **nuclear
[cacophony]{.mark}** that is [allowing]{.mark} a **free [run]{.mark}**
[towards]{.mark} an **[offence]{.mark}-defence
[spiral]{.mark}**]{.underline} as countries pursue the concept of
absolute security. The idea of mutual vulnerability that underwrote
nuclear deterrence, and which sought to be enshrined through the NAC,
appears to be a casualty of the process. This can be prominently seen in
the context of US-Russia and US- China threat perceptions of one another
and their consequent capability build up. Russia and China have long
expressed their concern about how the US ballistic missile defence (BMD)
would undercut their nuclear deterrence. To address the perceived
instability that would be so created, [they have moved ahead
with]{.underline} the deployment of [**MIRVed** missiles]{.underline},
cruise missiles, [and]{.underline} the development of hypersonic glide
vehicles (**[HGV]{.underline}**) to defeat the BMD.

Opinion Correspondent, New York Times, former Pentagon Correspondent, LA
Times; New York Times, "The Risk of Nuclear Conflict is Rising,"
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/07/opinion/nuclear-war-prevention.html\]

At the heart of all of this work is a [**chilling** conclusion: The
[possibility of]{.mark} a **nuclear [strike]{.mark}**, once
**inconceivable**]{.underline} in modern conflict, [[is more likely
**now** than]{.mark} at **[any other time]{.mark}** since the **Cold
War**. "We\'ve had 30 pretty **success**ful years keeping the **genie in
the bottle**]{.underline}," a senior administration official on the
Tiger Team said. While both America and Russia have hugely reduced their
nuclear arsenals since the height of the Cold War, the official said,
"Right now is when nuclear risk is most at the forefront." Russian
President Vladimir Putin [**reminded** the world of this
[**existential** danger]{.mark}]{.underline} last week when he publicly
warned of nuclear war if NATO deepened its involvement in Ukraine. [The
risk of **nuc**lear escalation [in **Ukraine**,]{.mark} while **now
low**, has been]{.underline} a primary **[concern]{.underline}** for the
Biden administration throughout the conflict, details of which are being
reported here for the first time. In a series of interviews over the
past year, U.S. and Ukrainian officials spoke on condition of anonymity
to discuss internal planning, diplomacy and ongoing security
preparations. And while it may cause sleepless nights in Washington and
Kyiv, most of the world has barely registered the threat. Perhaps it's
because an entire generation came of age in a post-Cold War world, when
the possibility of nuclear war was thought to be firmly behind us. It is
time to remind ourselves of the consequences in order to avoid them.
\<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> EVEN AFTER LAST week's nuclear threat, few
believe that Mr. Putin will wake up one day and decide to lob megaton
warheads at Washington or European capitals in retaliation for
supporting Ukraine. What Western allies see as more likely is that
Russia will use a so-called tactical nuclear weapon, which is less
destructive and designed to strike targets over short distances to
devastate military units on the battlefield. The strategic thinking
behind those weapons is that they are far less damaging than
city-destroying hydrogen bombs and therefore more "usable" in warfare.
The United States estimates Russia has a stockpile of up to 2,000
tactical nuclear warheads, some small enough they fit in an artillery
shell. But the detonation of any tactical nuclear weapon would be an
unprecedented test of the dogma of deterrence, a theory that has
underwritten America's military policy for the past 70 years. The idea
stipulates that adversaries are deterred from launching a nuclear attack
against the United States --- or more than 30 of its treaty-covered
allies --- because by doing so they risk an overwhelming counterattack.
Possessing nuclear weapons isn't about winning a nuclear war, the theory
goes; it's about preventing one. It hinges upon a carefully calibrated
balance of terror among nuclear states. \<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> IF MR.
PUTIN dropped a nuclear weapon on Ukraine --- a nonnuclear nation that's
not covered by anyone's nuclear umbrella --- what then? If deterrence
fails, how is it possible to reduce the risk of one attack escalating
into a global catastrophe? We might find an answer in the autumn of
2022, when fears of Russia's nuclear use in Ukraine were most palpable.
A lightning Ukrainian military counteroffensive had reclaimed territory
from the Russians in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The Ukrainians
were on the cusp of breaching Russian defense lines at Kherson in the
south, possibly causing a second Russian retreat that could signal an
imminent broader military collapse. U.S. intelligence estimated that if
Ukraine's fighters managed to break through Russian defenses --- and
were on the march to the occupied Crimean Peninsula, where the Russian
Black Sea Fleet is based --- it came down to a coin flip whether or not
Russia would launch a tactical nuclear weapon to stop them, senior
administration officials said. Moscow has made implicit and explicit
nuclear threats throughout the war to scare off Western intervention.
Around this time, however, a series of frightening episodes took place.
On Oct. 23, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu of Russia made a flurry of
phone calls to the defense chiefs of four NATO nations, including
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, to say Russia had indications that
Ukrainian fighters could detonate a dirty bomb --- a conventional
explosive wrapped in radioactive material --- on their own territory to
frame Moscow. American intelligence also intercepted chatter around then
among Russian military leaders about using a tactical nuclear weapon,
according to current and former Biden administration officials. General
Austin and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, held
three phone calls in four days with Russian counterparts during this
tense period. Believing the Russians were building an unfounded pretext
for their own nuclear attack, the Biden administration quickly began a
multilateral effort with allies, adversaries and nations in between to
de-escalate the situation and try to talk Moscow out of it. For nearly a
week, Biden aides pulled all-nighters at the White House, coordinating
high-level conversations and planning for the worst: the detonation of a
small nuclear device in Ukrainian territory that had the power of a few
kilotons or less. Many in the administration believed the Kremlin's
dirty bomb ploy posed the greatest risk of nuclear war since the 1962
Cuban missile crisis. State Department officials traveled to Poland to
ensure that medical supplies and radiation equipment were rushed over
the border. The Energy Department sent equipment to collect potential
debris so that it could be later analyzed by American scientists for
weapon design characteristics and the origin of the nuclear material.
U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear operations, directed a
team of experts (cheekily named The Writers' Club, because their
findings were written up daily for the Pentagon leadership) to assess
the risk and determine which conditions would trigger Russia to go
nuclear. While cautions about the potential withering economic,
diplomatic and military consequences were delivered in private to
Moscow, administration officials also publicly sounded alarm bells. The
administration's diplomatic push was coupled with efforts by leaders of
several nations, including China, India and Turkey, to explain to Mr.
Putin's government the potential costs if he were to go through with a
nuclear attack. That November, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, William J. Burns, met with his Russian counterpart in Turkey,
where he conveyed a similar warning. On Nov. 16, the Group of 20
released a joint statement: If the Russian leader was indeed inching
toward the brink, he stepped back. WHAT TOOK PLACE to prevent a nuclear
attack that fall was a rare moment of consensus on an issue on which
world leaders seem to be moving farther apart. Russia is replacing its
Soviet-era hardware with new jets, missiles and submarines. And the
other eight nations that have nuclear weapons are believed to be
enhancing their arsenals in parts of the world that are already on edge.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has continuing tensions over its
borders with China and Pakistan, [is [fielding
**longer**]{.mark}**-range** [weapons. **Pakistan**]{.mark} is
[developing **new** **b**]{.mark}allistic **[m]{.mark}**issiles and
expanding nuclear **production** facilities. **[North
Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which has an arsenal of several hundred
missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, regularly [**threatens** to
attack South Korea]{.underline}, where the U.S. keeps about 28,500
troops. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has publicly expressed
its desire to control the U.S.-allied island of Taiwan by force if
necessary, [is **increasing** its nuclear **arsenal**]{.underline} at a
"scale and pace unseen since the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race that
ended in the late 1980s," the Congressional Commission on the Strategic
Posture of the United States concluded in October. So while Washington
has been helping Ukraine prepare for a nuclear attack, [[**Taiwan**
or]{.mark} **South [Korea]{.mark}** could be **next**]{.underline}. The
National Security Council has already coordinated contingency playbooks
for possible [conflicts]{.underline} that [[could turn **nuclear**
in]{.mark} **Taiwan**, the **Korea**n Peninsula and the [**Middle
East**. **Iran**]{.mark}, which has [**continued** its
**nuc**]{.mark}lear [program amid **Israel**'s war]{.mark} on Hamas in
**Gaza**, has [amassed **enough**]{.mark} enriched **uranium** [to
build]{.mark} several **[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} if and when it
chooses. During this time of widening conflict, the rising nuclear
threat is especially destabilizing: A nuclear explosion in Ukraine or
Gaza, where tens of thousands of civilians have already been killed or
injured, would sizeably escalate either conflict and its humanitarian
toll. The world has been through a version of this moment before. The
last nuclear standoff during the Cold War was cooled in part because of
numerous nonproliferation efforts and arms control agreements between
the United States and the former Soviet Union. The two nations,
recognizing the terrifying situation they were in, worked to identify
weapons that were mutually menacing and simply agreed to eliminate them.
Nuclear warhead numbers plummeted to 12,500 today from roughly 70,400 in
1986. [Now that shared **[safety]{.mark} net** [of
**treaties**]{.mark}]{.underline} and agreements [[is **nearly
gone**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After a decade of diplomatic breakdown and
military antagonism, [**[only one]{.mark}** major arms treaty between

suspension, the two nations disclose little information about their
arsenals to each other and do not engage in talks for further
agreements. [[If]{.mark} nuclear **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}

through highly contagious and lethal diseases. As the COVID 19 pandemic
is now being controlled by various isolation measures, therapeutics and
vaccines, it became clear that our current lifestyle and societal
functions may not be sustainable in the long term. [We]{.underline} now
[have to start thinking and planning on how to face [the next]{.mark}
dangerous [pandemic]{.mark}, not just overcoming the one that is upon us
now.]{.underline} Is there any evidence that **[[even worse]{.mark}
pandemics could strike us]{.underline}** in the near future and
[threaten the existence of the human race]{.underline}? The answer is
unequivocally yes. It is not necessary to get infected by viruses of
bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that live in remote forests in
order to be in danger. [Creditable **scientific evidence**
indicates]{.underline} that the human [[gut]{.mark} microbiota **[harbor
billions of viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [which are capable of
affecting the function of **vital** human **organs** such as the immune
system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.]{.underline} It is
possible that the development of [pathogenic variants]{.underline} in
the gut **[[can]{.mark} lead to contagious viruses]{.underline}** [which
can [cause **pandemics**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leading to destruction
of vital organs]{.underline}, [causing death or various debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and
kidney]{.underline} failures. [These diseases could **[result in]{.mark}
the complete shutdown of**]{.underline} our
**[civilization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} probably the
**[[extinction]{.mark} of human race]{.underline}**. In this essay, I
will first provide a few independent pieces of scientific facts and then
combine this information to come up with some (but certainly not all)
hypothetical scenarios that could cause human race misery, even
extinction. I hope that these scary scenarios will trigger preventative
measures that could reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes. 1.
Introduction Le Chatelier's Principle: Named after the French chemist,
Le Chatelier's principle posits that "When an external stress (change in
pressure, temperature or concentration) is applied to a system in
chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium will change in such a way as to
reduce the effect of the stress." In other words, a change in a system
will evoke a counter-change, which will bring the equilibrium to a new
point. This principle operates with almost every human or other
activity. For example, it is known that when fruit production in the
Serengeti ecosystem is reduced, the number of elephants, which feed on
these fruits, is reduced proportionally. In the context of this essay, I
hypothesize that human-made changes in climate, the atmosphere, water,
soil, and all other planet-living organisms, will likely evoke
counter-changes that may be highly consequential to human life. Due to
the complexity of our ecosystem, humans do not know exactly how these
changes will affect them in the end. Consequently, they choose to
disregard them because lifestyle adjustments may cost money and
convenience or loss of well-established pleasures. 1.1. The earth is
changing rapidly What is changing on the earth that could induce a
potentially catastrophic counter-change? The answer is everything is
changing , from the living inhabitants (humans, other species, and
plants) to the atmosphere, water, soil, climate, among else. The changes
caused by human activity are sometimes dramatic. For example, it has
been estimated that about 1 million out of 8.5 million species of
plants, animals, and other organisms are in imminent danger of
extinction \[1\]. Other estimates show that 50% of the organisms that
existed 50 years ago have already gone extinct, not to consider
additional species that are gone before we even identify them. Soon, we
will likely be losing more than 80% of the world's species due to human
overdevelopment and its associated consequences. The major reasons for
species extinction are habitat destruction, pesticide poisoning, and
illegal hunting \[1\]. 2. Global warming Some may choose to believe what
the politicians are debating about: that climate change is a fact or
fiction, but the data say that the last 6 years were the warmest on
record \[2\]. Overall, the planet was 1.25°C warmer than in
preindustrial times (in the 1950s). Warmer oceans are melting ice sheets
and rising sea levels by almost 5 mm per year. In Australia,
record-setting heat and drought were responsible for the bushfires that
destroyed almost 25% of southeastern Australia's forests and their
living inhabitants, such as koalas. If we cannot slow down earth's
heating by reducing emissions, the current increase of about 0.2°C per
decade will likely be rapidly surpassed. How will the planet react?
Likely with more catastrophic fires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and floods.
The human homeostatic changes to increased temperatures are very complex
and include many vital organs \[3\]. Global warming may also cause
changes in the biology of our candidate foes, the viruses, bacteria, and
parasites that live in our gut and skin (see Section 2.2). 2.1. How much
human-made environmental damage has been done already? Humans are now
the undisputed masters of the planet and cannot be easily stopped from
actively destroying it, consciously or unconsciously. An interesting
question is how much damage has been claimed to be done already, and do
we have the data to support these claims? Elhacham et al. have recently
compared the natural biomass that exists on the earth with the
human-made (anthropogenic) mass \[4\]. They found that each person on
the globe produces a mass that is about equal to their body weight every
week! Is that too little or too much? Let us first define biomass and
anthropogenic mass. The majority of the earth's biomass is represented
by trees and bushes. The majority of the man-made mass is represented by
buildings and infrastructure such as roads and consists of concrete,
bricks, asphalt, metals, and plastic. Just consider that the total
global mass of produced plastic so far is greater than the overall mass
of all terrestrial and marine animals combined! So, how do we fare when
comparing biomass to anthropogenic mass production? In the 1900s, the
latter represented only 3% of global biomass; but now, in the 2020s, the
two masses are about equal. The projection is that if we go on with more
deforestation, buildings, streets, plastics, cars, and so on, by 2040,
it is likely that anthropogenic mass will almost triple the earth's
biomass. Will there be enough resources and clean air and water to
sustain the life of the projected 9 billion inhabitants? Anthropogenic
mass production is difficult to slow down since this activity is
considered part of our evolving civilization and way of living. 2.2.
Human microbiome The human body consists of approximately 30 trillion
cells, but the microbiota population in the human gut is estimated to be
300 trillion \[5\]! In addition, there is another microbiota in the skin
and other organs. It was initially thought that these microbiota act
locally (e.g., only in the gut or skin), but new evidence suggest that
the effects of microbiota may be global, reaching every cell in the
body. This can be achieved with various mechanisms, one being the
transmission of signals mediated by proteins that can travel through
anatomically distinct structures such as the vagus nerve. For example, a
protein called curli can travel through the vagus nerve and reach the
brain, where it can promote abnormal aggregation of proteins such as
a-synuclein, one major pathogenetic player in Parkinson's disease
\[5,6\]. Another and even more likely mechanism includes the diffusion
of bacterial or viral proteins (some could be toxins to various organs)
or pathogenic viruses into the bloodstream. From there, they can travel
around the body. This is reminiscent of cancer cell metastasis by the
hematogenous route. One piece of evidence for that happening is that
about half of the human metabolome (the collection of all metabolites in
the blood) is derived by host bacteria \[5\]. Bacteria or virus-derived
metabolites could also pass through the placenta and reach the fetus,
including the fetal brain, possibly causing diseases such as autism.
Despite skin not being as hospitable to microorganisms as the gut, a
typical person may have about 1,000 species of bacteria on their skin
\[7\]. These microbial communities continue to grow and diversify until
puberty when hormonal and developmental changes reach a plateau. The
balance between host and bacteria in the skin is determined by the
production of skin-derived microbial nutrients, microbiome-derived skin
nutrients, skin, and microbiome-derived antimicrobial peptides, and by
the interaction of the microbiome with the host's immune system. Similar
as in the gut, there is a delicate balance between beneficial and
potentially harmful bacteria and the host immune system. It is remotely
possible that our future enemies may derive from the gut, skin, or other
organs harboring microorganisms. In addition, the skin is more sensitive
to environmental changes such as climate change as it is directly
exposed to the environment. In conclusion, bacterial, viral, and
parasite-derived proteins or [pathogenic viruses]{.underline} thrive
locally (e.g., in the gut or skin) but [are [capable of]{.mark}
**[acting globally.]{.mark}**]{.underline} 2.3. Human viruses and how
they could cause disease [Many strains]{.underline} of gut bacteria are
harmless, but they [can become **dangerous pathogens**]{.underline}
[under certain conditions, such as **antibiotic use**]{.underline}
\[8\]. It is well known that gut bacteria can harbor many viruses
(bacterial phages) \[9\]. If they do not immediately kill the infected
bacteria, these viruses incorporate into the bacterial genome and stay
latent for extended periods (they are known "prophages"). These
prophages can be reactivated under certain environmental or other
factors and act like pathogenic viruses. It is rather surprising that,
in general, viruses are so many that they qualify as the most abundant
biological entities on the planet. Sometimes, gut bacteria use their
activated prophages as weapons to gain an advantage and kill other
competing bacteria. Phages could also assist in bacterial evolution as
the latter become more virulent \[10\]. The gut bacteria also seem to
interact with the host immune system and can influence the efficacy of
cancer immunotherapy \[11,12,13\]. The microbiome has been blamed for
playing direct or indirect roles in many human diseases, including
cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dementia, and others \[14\]. The
outcomes regarding health and disease depend on the balance of powers
among the gut/skin/other organ viruses, the gut/skin/other organ
microbiomes, and the host immune system. If this balance is disturbed, a
biological war between these players will be initiated, and the outcome
will be unpredictable. In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the
idea that phages in the mammalian intestine, skin, or elsewhere, not
only can be engulfed by certain eukaryotic cells but also might escape
from the gut or skin, enter the bloodstream, and make their way into
other parts of the body, with as yet undiscovered consequences. 2.4.
Viral variants [[Viruses evolve]{.mark} **continuously**]{.underline},
eventually [[leading to more **transmissible
variants**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline} sometimes [can be
more **lethal**]{.underline} than the original strains. The SARS-CoV-2
is an excellent contemporary example. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2
are rapidly spreading and are becoming dominant in certain geographic
areas \[15,16\]. For example, the B.1.1.7 variant (United Kingdom) has
23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; variant 501Y.V2 (South Africa)
has 23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; and P.1 variant (Brazil) has
approximately 35 mutations with 17 amino acid changes. In April 2021,
when this document was first written, I speculated verbatim that "new
variants with additional mutations could become able to evade our
currently available vaccines by weakening the ability of vaccine-induced
antibodies to neutralize/block viral entry, and by strengthening the
ability of the virus to enter the cells via surface receptors." The
so-called "omicron variant," isolated in November 2021, already
fulfilled this prediction. 2.5. How COVID-19 and possibly other viruses
affect the brain In general, viral invasion of the central nervous
system may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic
transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve,
infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the
blood--brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells via
transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding
and a subsequent proteolytic event, facilitated by transmembrane
protease serine 2 \[17\]. Is there evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can enter
the brain? The answer is yes \[18\]. As already mentioned, one route is
by migrating from the cribriform plate along the olfactory tract \[19\]
or through vagal pathways. Another route may include viral entry into
brain capillary endothelial cells via the ACE2 pathway. Viral RNA was
detected in the medulla and cerebellum by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. However, viral proteins seem to
be absent from neurons and glial cells. Consequently, the adverse events
of the virus on the brain, including altered neurotransmission and
neuronal damage, are likely mediated by neuroinflammation and hypoxic
injury through cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators. 2.6.
SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses can affect the senses Viruses can
affect our senses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia (loss of
smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) in 40--70% of COVID-19 patients
\[20\]. These effects persist, but it is unknown for how long. Other
neurological symptoms include headache, stroke, impairment of
consciousness, seizure, anxiety, and encephalopathy. Current evidence
suggests that SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia may be a new viral syndrome
specific to COVID-19. This syndrome is likely mediated by intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into the olfactory neural circuitry. Since the
olfactory sensory neurons do not express ACE2 receptor, the likely
explanation for the loss of smell is the damage of accessory cells
supporting these neurons. Although anosmia is not a lethal or severe
disease, other neurological damage such as blindness could be
devastating \[21,22\]. 3 Adverse scenarios Fifty years ago, [one adverse
scenario regarding a pandemic was **presented**]{.underline} in the film
"The Andromeda strain," which describes a pandemic caused by a pathogen
of extraterrestrial origin \[23\]. Here, I present an alternative
hypothetical scenario that involves an endogenous virus. Obviously,
[there is a **myriad** of similar scenarios]{.underline}, and [the one
given]{.underline} below can be currently classified as fictional but
**[not impossible]{.underline}**. A prophage, which was residing dormant
for years in the genome of the commensal gut bacterium Bifidobacterium
infantis suddenly, and without an apparent reason, has undergone
induction and started to produce viral proteins, which were subsequently
assembled into whole phages. After cell lysis, these phages infected
other neighboring cells. This cycle was repeated many times, and
millions of free virions were released, some entering the systemic
circulation (viremia). Some virions reached the lung endothelium and
entered the endothelial cells through an, as yet, unknown receptor and
started replicating and lysing these cells. The resulting mucous caused
the host to cough, thus facilitating the transfer of the virus to other
humans through aerosol droplets. Soon, the virus was able to infect,
first a few hundred, then thousands, then millions of other unsuspected
people through coughing and sneezing. The virus was able to travel all
over the world as the pulmonary manifestations were mild, and most
infected individuals thought it was a common flu or a similar ailment.
[Scientists isolated the virus that caused this]{.underline} flu-like
[disease and determined]{.underline} from its genomic sequence that [it
was a novel member of influenza]{.underline} virus B, which usually
causes seasonal flu. [Despite the **pandemic**]{.underline} nature of
the infection, [nobody died]{.underline}, [and governmental bodies were
not]{.underline} highly [concerned]{.underline}. [Six months
later]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} individual [reported a weakening
of his vision]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, within 3 months,
[progressed to **total** blindness]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
unusual form of blindness [quickly spread to other people]{.underline}
until scientists performed epidemiological studies, which linked the
blindness to the previously mentioned mild flu. Soon afterward,
scientists isolated and identified the virus from the brains of blind
and subsequently succumbed individuals and confirmed that the sequence
matched the virus that caused the unusual flu. More elaborate studies
had shown that there was unusual and very severe neuroinflammation
around the occipital lobe of the brain (Brodmann area 17), an area
responsible for the interpretation of visual signals arriving from the
optic nerve. Several therapeutics were tried, but none was proven to be
effective. [Twelve months into the pandemic]{.underline}, **[10
million]{.underline}** people **[lost their vision]{.underline}**, [and
within 18 months]{.underline}, without any success in developing
therapies or a vaccine, [the blindness had spread to]{.underline}
**[whole nations]{.underline}**. 3.1 Blindness The selection of
blindness as a chronic consequence of an acute pandemic was deliberate.
In 1995, Portuguese author Jose Saramago published a fictional novel
entitled "Blindness" (ISBN: 9780151002511), which contributed to him
winning the Nobel Prize in literature in 1998. Blindness, as portrayed
in the book, is a highly detailed story of a mysterious mass
**[epidemic]{.underline}** [that [caused]{.mark}]{.underline} blindness
of a whole nation and the **[[social breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that followed. [The]{.underline} blindness [pandemic]{.underline}, in
many respects, [is reminiscent of]{.underline} the current
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic. Blindness [caused]{.underline}
widespread **[panic, anarchy, and government lockdowns]{.underline}**.
The life of the blind people was characterized by filthiness, aggressive
manners, disrespect of others, and a struggle to survive by any possible
means. The [breakdown]{.underline} of society [was]{.underline} near
**[total]{.underline}**. [Law and order, social services,
government]{.underline}, schools could **[no longer
function]{.underline}**. Families have been separated and could not find
one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food.
[Violence, disease, and despair]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}**
to overwhelm **[human coping]{.underline}**. One of Saramago's quotes,
describing life after blindness, is reproduced here "Perhaps humanity
will manage to live without eyes, but then it will cease to be humanity,
the result is obvious..." 3.2 Other ailments Acute
[pandemics]{.underline} could [cause]{.underline} many other **[chronic
diseases]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} can [threaten]{.underline}
the [sustainability]{.underline} of our present society. Although
COVID-19 causes loss of smell and taste, these are considered
nonlife-threatening ailments. However, in the long run, the permanent
absence of smell and taste will mean the loss of innumerable current
pleasures associated with the consumption of food and drinks. Clearly,
loss of hearing will not be compatible with current societal functions
or human achievements. [Acute viral diseases are]{.underline} also
[associated with innumerable]{.underline} **[[organ-specific
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such as heart, kidney, and reproductive
failures and disturbance of other vital functions that can]{.underline}
~~paralyze~~ \[[[hamstring]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [our current
[society,]{.mark} economy, and culture]{.underline}. Even a minor
weakening of our memory (mild cognitive impairment) could [result
in]{.underline} **[chaotic situations]{.underline}** that authors of
fiction, such as Saramago, attempt to describe in detail in future
books. 3.3 Epilog [Humans]{.underline} have learned to [take for granted
what they]{.underline} currently [have]{.underline} and enjoy. Perhaps,
we did not realize that [the human race's]{.underline} spectacular
[advances are dependent on several]{.underline} potentially volatile
[abilities]{.underline} (senses, brain function) [and that]{.underline}
even one loss, or diminution of such abilities, [could be]{.underline}
**[detrimental, [causing]{.mark} a [collapse of]{.mark} our
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic helped us
realize that [we may be sitting on a **time bomb**]{.underline}, [which
might]{.underline} **[explode]{.underline}** if we continue disturbing
the current equilibrium between humans and other planetary partners. In
addition to viruses of a rather exotic origin, such as SARS-CoV-2,
billions of other viruses and other infectious agents in our gut, skin,
and elsewhere are waiting for the right time to attack us. The lessons
learned from COVID-19 should be a wake-up call for humans to stop
disturbing the equilibrium with actions that favor the well-being of
humans but put in danger the existence of other inhabitants of planet
earth. Human [migration]{.underline}, also known as "travel," has
[facilitated the travel of our **foes**]{.underline}, along with us, [in
**every**]{.underline} conceivable [corner of the world]{.underline}.
Finally, yet, importantly, artists are always ahead of scientists in
seeing things coming. On this occasion, the rock band R.E.M. released a
song 30 years ago entitled "**[It's [the end of the world as we know
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and I feel fine)." They are likely not far
off their prediction!

1\. Introduction Despite recent social protests and climate emergency
declarations, [efforts to mitigate climate change to date are
**insufficient**]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[emissions continue to rise and global [warming **above 3
°**]{.mark}**C** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[increasingly
[likely]{.mark} this century]{.underline}**.2 [There is emerging
evidence of]{.underline} amplifying [[feedbacks
**accelerating**]{.underline}]{.mark}3 and dampening feedbacks
decelerating.4 These [feedbacks [exacerbate]{.mark} the possibility of
**[runaway]{.mark}** global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline},5 [estimated
at **8 °C**]{.underline} [or greater]{.underline} by 2100.6 Such
temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers,7 shifting
the narrow climate niche within which humans have resided for
millennia.8 Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is
concern that the [effects of ﻿ [climate change]{.mark} may [pose an ﻿
**existential risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline}, one
[that threatens "**societal collapse**" or]{.underline} even
**[extinction]{.underline}**.9 Understanding these worst-case scenarios
is essential for good risk management.10 Improving awareness of
potential pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses such a risk can
help inform decision- making about interventions.11 Considering societal
impacts that are more tangible for individuals, businesses and
governments,12 and better ﻿ aligned with conventional risk priorities,13
may facilitate more effective action to mitigate ﻿ climate change.14 A
number of pathways through which ﻿ climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15 [Climate
change]{.underline} is predicted to [undermine **agricultural** systems
and [disrupt **food**]{.mark} **supply**]{.underline},16 [which may
[lead to **economic** shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[socio-
political]{.underline}** [[instability]{.mark} as well as
**starvation**]{.underline}, **[migration]{.underline}** [[and
conflict]{.mark} at local through to **global scale**]{.underline}.17
[While]{.underline} the [climate **science**]{.underline} underpinning
global warming estimates [is well established]{.underline},18 albeit
subject to sensitivities, the [uncertainties increase
**significantly**]{.underline} [when we]{.underline} start to
[consider]{.underline} these [tangible societal impacts]{.underline}
given the complex relationships involved.19 [Our understanding of
worst-case scenarios]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} particularly of
empirical evidence addressing the [causal pathways]{.underline} through
which ﻿ climate change may cause societal collapse, [is]{.underline}
**[underdeveloped]{.underline}**.20 In this chapter we aim to identify
and structure an empirical evidence base of the relationships between ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse. We do this using
Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system dynamics approach that is useful
for visualising the relationships between variables in a complex
system.21 This chapter is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review
the societal collapse and ﻿ existential risk literature to refine the aim
introduced above. In Section 3, we develop an original methodology to
establish a new empirical evidence base and create a novel-format CLD of
causal pathways between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. In
Section 4, we present and discuss the results from the application of
this methodology to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway of interest. We conclude, in Section 5, by
identifying avenues of future work that may build upon this chapter. 2.
Literature Review To refine the aim of this chapter, introduced in
Section 1, our review examines whether there is historical evidence of ﻿
climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse and to what extent
have causal pathways been documented to inform our understanding of ﻿
climate change as an existential threat to contemporary society. We
first define the terms "﻿ existential risk" and "societal collapse" as
used in this chapter. Adopting ﻿ Ord's definition, "an ﻿ existential risk
is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term
potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as societal collapse, or
complete destruction, such as extinction.22 Adopting Kemp's definition,
[societal collapse]{.underline} is an "enduring loss of ﻿ population,
identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it [may be **abrupt**
or gradual]{.underline}, [but is typically **rapid**]{.underline}
because it is notably transformative, [and may be experienced
by]{.underline} a local, national or [the **global community** of
people]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents a conceptual model of societal
collapse, synthesised from the broader literature, to provide further
contextual definition. [\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]]{.underline} The rise and
fall of civilisations has been documented since the earliest recordings
of history and is increasingly studied to inform our understanding of
societal collapse.24 We consider two types of historical studies that
provide insight into ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse
in the past. We note that other mechanisms are also discussed in the
literature, and there is debate about the role of different mechanisms
in particular societal collapse events. The first type of historical
study empirically investigates an individual societal collapse event
using primary sources, including anthropological, archaeological and
paleontological data. Based on such data analysis, natural ﻿ [climate
change has been]{.underline} asserted as [a mechanism of societal
collapse in]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** of these [case
studies]{.underline}, as established by de Menocal25 and Weiss and
Bradley.26 For example, Hodell et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and
Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse paleoclimate data alongside the
[archaeological record]{.underline} to [show]{.underline} that
[drought]{.underline} conditions, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to solar forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
Classic **[Maya]{.underline}** [civilisation]{.underline} of Mesoamerica
in \~8--10th century CE. Weiss et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et
al.32 show that [regional aridity]{.underline}, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to ﻿ volcanic forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse of]{.underline} multiple [societies
**across Mesopotamia**]{.underline}, including the Akkadian Empire in
\~22nd century BCE. Similarly, natural ﻿ [climate change has been
implicated in]{.underline} the [collapse of multiple Late Bronze Age
societies]{.underline} around the Mediterranean,33 [including
**Mycenaean** Kingdoms]{.underline} in \~12th century BCE,34 the
Harappan Civilization of South Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor
Empire of Southeast Asia in \~15th century CE,36 **[multiple Chinese
Dynasties]{.underline}**37 [and civilisations along the Silk
Road]{.underline}38 during the previous millennium, [the Norse
Vikings]{.underline} of Greenland in \~16th century AD,39 and the
Tiwanaku Empire of Pre- Columbian South America in \~10th century CE40
amongst others. This first type of studies establishes precedence of
natural ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout
history, demonstrating the risk that anthropogenic ﻿ climate change
similarly poses to contemporary society. However, the events examined
occurred more than 100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient
history, when societies were relatively isolated. Because these case
studies pre- date contemporary society, they do not provide empirical
evidence of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change in context of today's highly
interconnected society.41 Statistical evaluation of the frequency and
significance of natural ﻿ climate change relative to other mechanisms of
societal collapse identified across these case studies has not yet been
established within the literature. However, the second type of
historical study does qualitatively examine collections of these case
studies to develop theories of predominant modes of societal collapse.
Three major modes are observed, as follows. Fagan42 and McMichael43
focus on natural impact on the human system across multiple
civilisations, concluding that natural ﻿ climate change is predominant
having significantly influenced human existence throughout history.
[Over]{.underline} the past [12,000 years]{.underline}, the [natural and
human systems developed within the **stable climate niche**]{.underline}
[of the Holocene]{.underline} Epoch.44 The associated geographic
endowments governed human transition from band societies based on
foraging to complex societies based on agriculture. Unfavourable subtle
(e.g. weather variations) and drastic (e.g. natural disasters) shifts in
climate influenced the collapse of complex societies either by direct
loss of life or indirectly via resource insecurity. In particular, in
this mode, typically, the loss of agriculture led to de-﻿ population via
famine, migration or conflict due to food insecurity. Ponting,45
Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that human overpopulation and
overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of the environment is
predominant. [Societal collapse via environmental
degradation]{.underline} often [involved **unsustainable**]{.underline}
[agriculture]{.underline}, [exacerbated by]{.underline} natural ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}, [leading to de-﻿ population as well as
**institutional breakdown**]{.underline} [via loss of **economic
stability**]{.underline} [and socio-political
**dysfunction**]{.underline} due to magnified inequality.
[This]{.underline} mode [aligns with]{.underline} early "Malthusian ﻿
catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the commons",49 and "**[overshoot-and-
collapse]{.underline}**"50 theories. In their 12-volume magnum opus
exploring the rise and fall of 28 civilizations, Toynbee concludes that
"[great civilizations are not murdered]{.underline} \[[but]{.underline}
rather\] they [take their **own lives**]{.underline}."51 Building on
this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and Robinson,53 and Johnson54 focus on human
impact on the human system across multiple civilisations, concluding
that societal complexity in relation to problem-solving inability (e.g.
environmental degradation) and institutional dysfunction (e.g.
inequality and oligarchy internally, trade ally and hostile neighbour
relations externally) is predominant. As a society becomes more complex,
it reaches a point beyond which "continued investment in complexity as a
problem-solving strategy yields a declining marginal return" and it will
be at risk of collapsing under its own weight via institutional
breakdown and de-﻿ population.55 This mode aligns with "energy returned
on energy invested" theory,56 applied to explore societal collapse by
Homer-Dixon.57 Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and Schwartz and Nichols60 examine
why some civilisations have been able to thrive or recover, rather than
collapse. They similarly conclude that societies have flourished due to
combinations of favourable geographic endowment, managing their
existence within the carrying capacity of the natural system, and
co-operative action in problem-solving. This second type of studies
highlights that societal collapse involves a complex nexus of factors
and dynamically interlinked events. For instance, Gibbon details how all
three of the modes, described in the preceding five paragraphs,
contributed to the collapse of the ﻿ Roman Empire.61 These modes of
societal collapse, although based on empirical evidence pre-dating
contemporary society, describe key aspects of the anthropogenic ﻿ climate
change problem faced today. While these studies describe causal pathways
of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used CLDs to
untangle the complexity and give structure to the dense information in
this evidence base. Across these historical studies, we observe no
apparent temporal or spatial influence on the occurrence of societal
collapse. Rather, societal collapse has been described as occurring in
various forms, whether it be by known "white-swan" or surprise "black
swan" events,62 in different geographic locations and times throughout
history. Additionally, a quantitative statistical analysis by Arbesman
shows that societal collapse has occurred randomly and independent of
civilisation life- spans.63 These qualitative and quantitative
observations highlight that any society may be susceptible to collapse,
much in-line with the Red Queen Hypothesis of the Law of Extinction.
From these historical studies, we observe sets of secondary determinants
for each of the primary determinants introduced in Fig. 1, which are
defined in Fig. 2. Considering a geographically bounded society,
emigration refers to any permanent departure of ﻿ population including
both voluntary or forced migration, conflict mortality accounts for
deaths directly arising from any form of domestic or international
conflict (e.g. due to ﻿ war), and natural mortality accounts for deaths
related to domestic environmental conditions (e.g. due to famine). The
loss of socio-cultural norms, political structures or economic value
accounts for that which notably transforms the identity and institutions
of the society. [\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]]{.underline} In addition to these
historical studies, we consider the relatively nascent studies of
existential risks (X-risks) that provide insight into how ﻿ climate
change may trigger societal collapse in the future. Comprehensive
surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the collapse of
contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 ﻿ Rees,66 and Ord67 provide
eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the academic
literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many **historically**]{.underline}
[observed mechanisms of societal collapse]{.underline},
**[including]{.underline}** natural [﻿]{.underline} [climate
change]{.underline}, [remain applicable as X-risks today]{.underline}.
However, the ﻿ state of existence of contemporary society has led to a
different landscape in which these mechanisms apply, and to a number of
unprecedented mechanisms, including anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. ﻿
Ehrlich and ﻿ Ehrlich70 and Häggström71 note that [although [increased
**complexity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as globalisation and ﻿
tech]{.underline}nological advancement, [can increase a society's
**resilience** and **adaptability**]{.underline}, [it can also [increase
﻿**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, globalisation
increases resilience to local agricultural production shocks through
access to global markets; however, it also increases ﻿ vulnerability
through ﻿ exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such as trade
restrictions.72 Some **[geoengineering technologies]{.underline}**, for
example, [may enable society to mitigate]{.underline} and adapt to ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}; [however]{.underline}, [they
may]{.underline} also **[increase ﻿ vulnerability]{.underline}** [to ﻿
**termination shocks**]{.underline}, [where **failure**]{.underline} [of

Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific ﻿ climate change
literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to worst-case
scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the natural
system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average
weather (e.g. [temperature]{.underline}) [and natural
disasters]{.underline} (e.g. floods) affected by ﻿ climate change [could
impact human mortality **directly**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
two effects, [coupled with sea level rise]{.underline} due to melting of
ice caps, [could indirectly impact human mortality via

([e.g. land quality]{.underline}) [and the human world]{.underline}
system ([e.g. ﻿ **infrastructure failures**]{.underline}) [resulting in
**resource**]{.underline} and service **[insecurity]{.underline}**.
[This insecurity could impact **institutional stability**]{.underline},
[resulting in economic loss]{.underline}, [political dysfunction and
social **unrest**]{.underline}, [as well as migration and
**conflict**]{.underline}. The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary
society against the threat of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change range from
dystopian (collapse) to utopian (recovery). These futures studies
identify endpoints of different causal pathways between anthropogenic ﻿
climate change effects and potential impacts on the human world system,
with the latter reflecting key determinants of societal collapse
observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made limited in-roads
to empirically investigating the top-level relationships between some of
these endpoints using recent datasets. The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of mortality, conflict and migration
are, respectively, examined by Mora et al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer
et al.81 The feedback between migration and conflict driven by climate
change is examined by Abel et al.82 The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of economic loss, political instability
and shifts in cultural norms are examined by Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu
and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85 respectively. However, the complex
bottom-level links between and surrounding these endpoints are generally
ill understood,86 and the strength of empirical evidence is poorly
documented from a systems science perspective.87 To the best of our
knowledge, **[no study]{.underline}** has [empirically examined how the
impacts of ﻿ climate change could explicitly translate into societal
collapse for **contemporary** society]{.underline}. [We **do not have a
clear picture**]{.underline} [of ﻿ climate change as a ﻿ **systemic risk**
to our globalised society]{.underline}, particularly at spatial scales
accounting for the heterogeneity of individual identity, business
governance and policymaking across nations, and international exchanges.
This limits our ability to understand feedbacks, identify intervention
points, develop quantitative models and inform strategies to minimise
the risk of societal collapse occurring in the future.88 Given the
insights from this review, we refine the aim of this chapter as follows.
Firstly, the empirical evidence base should specifically address
contemporary society. Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at a scale
and granularity that addresses the heterogenous characteristics of
nations and international interactions. The refined aim of this chapter
is thus to identify an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structure
the evidence base with a CLD defined at global scale and national
granularity. 3. Methodology A two-stage framework, consisting of five
steps, was developed to achieve the aim of this chapter. For each step,
below, we first introduce it generically and then describe its
application to our specific analysis of the ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway. 3.1. Stage 1:
Establishing an empirical evidence base of societal collapse in
contemporary society Step I deploys societal collapse proxies via a key
word search to identify "evidence points", which in this instance may be
considered data points, in the form of publications that empirically
examine the causal pathway of interest in contemporary society. The
determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these societal collapse proxies
to establish the new empirical evidence base in lieu of historical
societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary society. The ﻿
population loss set are straightforward to isolate, consistent to
measure across nations and describe tangible consequences. The
institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the societal
collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality (i.e.
starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality and
emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports. The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the
search is contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately
3,000 publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main
body as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of
the following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly. This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base
consisting of 41 evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4. Step
II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical evidence
base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final CLD (f-CLD)
in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base across the
system. In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread
as this provides information on data that may be useful for future
studies. Four methodological categories were identified in the new
empirical evidence base. Each evidence point was classified into one of
these categories and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative ﻿
complex systems model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative
dataset --- blue; collection / analysis of qualitative interview /
survey data --- green; quantitative data-led case study / scenario ---
yellow. The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is
shown in Fig. 4. 3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop
diagram from the empirical evidence base Step III involves creating an
individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence point to clearly structure the
complex causal relationships examined. These i-CLDs provide the building
blocks from which to construct the f-CLD in Step IV. [\[FIGURE 3
REMOVED\]]{.underline} The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The
corresponding evidence point was examined in its entirety to identify
and record key information in the form of variables (nodes), links
(arrowed lines) and relationship notation (positive or negative). Key
information derived from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main
analysis, of the evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according
to the typology classification established in Step II. Any relationships
hypothesised but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey.
Key information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review,
of the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of
the i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process
was repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set
of i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base. All 41
i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity. The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect
is related to component (variables and links) definition, necessary to
maximise clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained
in the evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs
becoming dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their ﻿ utility. The
other aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the
f-CLD conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows. The \~950 variables
from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank worksheet for the
f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering approach was used to
reconcile these variables into like groups. For each group, an
overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD variables in the group
were virtually deposited into a matrix for that major node. For example,
drought, sea level rise and crop disease were some of the i-CLD
variables clustered into an environmental risk factors f-CLD major node
matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level of aggregation
representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled down any global
or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national or local
aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household food imports
was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled up to
national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD. The \~1150 links from the
set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed lines between the major
nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required interpretation of implied
causality in the i-CLD relationships in order to route them across the
major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an i-CLD showed a direct
link from international food price to conflict variables, this was
routed using arrowed lines from international food price to national
food price to food ﻿ accessibility to food insecurity and finally to
conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there was a discrepancy
between relationship descriptions, the relationship with the most
supporting i-CLDs was adopted. The interim f-CLD produced at the end of
each standardisation iteration was examined to determine whether the
major node definition could be refined to maximise clarity. For example,
in one iteration water and land were defined as separate major nodes,
but examination determined that each had the same arrowed lines to other
major nodes; therefore, another iteration was undertaken with water and
land now clustered under a single natural resources major node in order
to minimise redundant arrowed lines. This process was iterated several
times until an f-CLD had been constructed at an appropriate level of
detail for this study. Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in
Section 290 was cross- referenced, but not included as evidence points,
to ensure comprehensive coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD. The
standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.). Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD
using a weighted (line thickness) typology (colour-coded) approach. This
visually documents the spread of the evidence base across the system
described by the f-CLD. The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as
follows. Each variable (node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its
corresponding major node(s) in the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of
the i-CLD was assigned to a corresponding route along the arrowed lines
in the f-CLD. Each time an arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link
assigned to it, an incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in
the corresponding typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to
the f-CLD arrowed line. This process was repeated for each of the 41
i-CLDs until all had been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process
for each of the 41 i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information
(D.). The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5. 4. Results and Discussion The new empirical evidence base and
novel-format CLD of ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society resulting from the application of our
original methodology (Section 3) are discussed in turn below. 4.1.
Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society The new empirical evidence base
(Section 3, Step I), along with its colour-coded typology (Section 3,
Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It consists of 41 evidence points, of
which 9 examine the natural mortality (i.e. starvation, with respect to
food insecurity), 20 the conflict mortality and 12 the emigration
societal collapse proxy, alongside other human and natural world system
factors. We discuss three key aspects of the evidence base, namely
temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven method distribution, and
advantages of each data-driven methods, below. The temporal scale and
granularity of study varies across the evidence base; however, our
methodology limited the possible scale of study to the period from 1990
to present, representative of contemporary society. Within this period,
approximately half of the evidence points cover a scale of less than one
decade and the other half a scale of greater than one decade.
Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses at yearly
granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity greater
than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at monthly
granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies across
the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD. The distribution
of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is notably
different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for natural
mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey data. This
is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human survival is
well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food and mortality
data sets would not yield significantly new insights into thresholds
whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an individual's
circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence points for
conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of existing datasets.
This likely reflects the interest in rigorously curated conflict
datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and peace fields.
Evidence points for emigration mostly use collection/analysis of
interview/survey data, likely because this provides nuanced insight into
an individual's decision to migrate. It may also be due to data
availability and quality challenges that limit quantitative statistical
analyses, which are being addressed by groups such as the International
Organization for Migration's Global Migration Data Analysis Centre.93
Amongst these data challenges, it is important to recognise the issue of
reconciling different types of voluntary and forced migration with
causal drivers, given the complex social, economic and political factors
at play; this challenge similarly applies to the other societal collapse
proxies but is particularly noted in the migration studies. We observe
from these studies that a food insecurity threshold for natural
mortality is well established but thresholds for conflict mortality and
emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal drivers within
datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these determinants
remains a "grand challenge".94 [\[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\]]{.underline} Each
data-driven method offers different advantages. The ﻿ complex ﻿ systems
models each describe "chunks" of the system at different scale and
granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are ﻿ calibrated
to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key
relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively
examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables within the system, which can be used as a
mathematical basis for extending ﻿ modelling capabilities. The
collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into
qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that
quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case
study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert
interpretation to better understand global trends and ﻿ forecasts. These
latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of ﻿
modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their
application in decision- making processes. Collectively, these different
data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of
relationships in the system of interest. 4.2. Causal loop diagram of the
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary
society at global scale and national granularity The main result of this
chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3, Step V), presented in Fig.
5. It structures the relationships between ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse as described in our new empirical
evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in Section 4.1). We
discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights related to the
spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative ﻿ complex system depicted,
and quantitative ﻿ complex system ﻿ modelling, below, alongside
consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of CLDs. Our
CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our
empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively,
to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the
empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables.
Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused
with respect to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of
gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that the link between
food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence
points using statistical analyses (blue), whereas the links between food
insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality,
have been investigated mostly by evidence points using
interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may be useful to
investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter
using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered
by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1. It is
important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density for
important links or even be missing important variables and/or links,
either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word
search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For
example, our study focused on the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical
evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway, whereas
the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between
fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence.
Similarly, our use of the ﻿ population loss set of societal collapse
proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict
mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown set are
not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to
maximise the ﻿ rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the
spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of
exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD
presented here. Further, we can see that while empirical studies have
linked ﻿ climate change via food insecurity to our societal collapse
proxies of natural mortality, conflict mortality and emigration, we
found no empirical studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of
societal collapse. This was expected given the motivation of this study
(Section 1) and is due to the fact that there are no contemporary events
of societal collapse, under the same definition as those in the
historical studies pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these
links to be empirically studied.95 Having considered the spread of
empirical evidence, we now consider the ﻿ complex system documented. A
key benefit of CLDs is that they simply present a myriad of information
in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs enable comprehension of the
structure and behaviour of ﻿ complex systems, including feedbacks,
intervention points and far- reaching interdependencies.96 Our CLD
visually depicts a system of 39 variables, 105 links and 32,000 feedback
loops,97 integrating information from different fields including climate
science, ﻿ food security, conflict, migration and health research.
Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how ﻿ population
growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic
factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive ﻿
climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive ﻿ climate change via
consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly
(e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/ output
(e.g. processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g.
extreme weather events) of ﻿ climate change may cause losses of food
production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via
agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for
irrigation). A country's food availability is influenced by domestic
food production and international food trade. Food ﻿ accessibility is
influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of
food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international
food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food
subsidies). Food utilisation is influenced by ﻿ infrastructure/services
(e.g. ﻿ education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural
traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of
food availability, food ﻿ accessibility and food utilisation. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation),
conflict and migration, contributing to ﻿ population loss, as well as
economic shocks and socio- political instability, contributing to
institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse. [Beyond]{.underline} a given country suffering [increased
natural mortality]{.underline}, [famines]{.underline} (i.e. [food
insecurity]{.underline}) [can place pressure on international
humanitarian efforts]{.underline} ([i.e. **institutional** risk
factors]{.underline}). [Conflict may occur domestically or
**internationally**]{.underline} [and can **feedback**]{.underline} [to
**exacerbate**]{.underline} [food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential
[mass emigration can increase **pressure** on food
availability]{.underline}, [natural resources and ﻿
infrastructure/services in the destination nation]{.underline}, which
can lead to socio- cultural tensions (i.e. institutional risk factors)
that fuel conflict. [[Food insecurity]{.mark} can]{.underline} also
**[directly]{.underline}** [[contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark}
institutional risk factors such as [social unrest, political instability
and economic inequality]{.underline}, [which increase the risk of
[societal collapse due to **institutional

internationally**]{.underline}. [While already fragile ﻿ states are
**expected**]{.underline} [to be hit the worst
**directly**]{.underline}, these [insights reveal the **indirect**
ramifications of ﻿ climate change on our **globalised
society**]{.underline},98 [with **serious consequences**]{.underline}
[for **humanity's "existential security".**]{.underline}99 [While some
of these relationships may appear **obvious**]{.underline}, it is the
act of [**bringing** this information]{.underline}, [which may otherwise
be **siloed**]{.underline} and thus preventing consideration of the full
story, **[together]{.underline}** [in one place]{.underline} that [is of
value]{.underline}.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to provide readers
with the opportunity to explore the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, consider worst-case scenarios that we
want to avoid, develop transformative narratives of "where we want to
go" and think about interventions that may help us attain this desired
future.101 It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as
their information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on
information portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our
interpretation of that information. As such, there exist challenges and
limitations.102 For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships
in different contexts and locations, because they can only depict a
single scale and granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality
between variables in a CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both
directions rather than one. CLDs can often become either too complicated
or too simplified, which undermines their usefulness. In considering
each of these issues, our original methodology attempted to maximise the
﻿rigour and transparency of our study by first documenting the
information in each evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently
applying, and recording, the iterative process of reconciling the
variables and links from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the
selected global scale and national granularity. In doing so, we sought
to enable the reader to be aware of the nuances of the different scales
and granularity of information underpinning our CLD, as well as our
process of carefully reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39
variables and 1150 links to 105 links to maximise the information
conveyed while balancing readability. It is also important to note that,
due to their qualitative and static ﻿ nature, CLDs do not enable us to
comprehend the dynamics of the system, including nonlinear and emergent
behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative results and time delays.103
Complex systems models, although with their own challenges and
limitations,104 provide the opportunity to quantitatively analyse the
dynamics of a system and gain insights into the potentially far-reaching
impacts of our decisions.105 However, ﻿ complex ﻿ systems models that
explicitly examine societal collapse in contemporary society are
underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics model106 --- an evidence
point in this study (refer to Supplementary Information D).107 --- is
the eminent model of relevance, with only a limited number of studies
building on it. World3 examines the potential for
"overshoot-and-collapse" given ﻿ population and industrial growth within
the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system, implicitly
accounting for ﻿ climate change and explicitly accounting for food
availability. The information contained in our CLD and empirical
evidence base may be useful in identifying and informing opportunities
to improve these existing ﻿ complex systems ﻿ modelling capabilities for ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For
example, our CLD highlights important factors at global scale and
national granularity that World3 does not incorporate because it is
defined at global scale and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish
heterogenous characteristics of nations, such as distribution of ﻿
population or geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does
not account for international interactions, such as food trade, conflict
and migration. Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by
natural mortality (defined by food availability, age and pollution) and
does not include the other two ﻿ population loss secondary determinants,
as noted in the previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown
secondary determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide
useful direction to datasets, it is important to note that
quantitatively defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as
discussed in Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing ﻿ complex
﻿systems models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with
national identity, business governance and policy-making are
concentrated at national level, and international interactions underpin
the functioning of contemporary society it could be valuable to model
societal collapse risk profiles of different nations to inform the
prioritisation and development of intervention strategies. [\[FIGURE 5
REMOVED\]]{.underline} 5. Conclusions and Future Work This chapter
identified an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structured
the evidence base using a novel-format CLD defined at global scale and
national granularity. Two types of future work could extend from the
results of this chapter. Identification of gaps in the spread of
evidence across the CLD may guide future data-driven efforts to examine
these causal relationships and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence
base may be used to develop quantitative ﻿ modelling capabilities,
particularly by transforming the structure of World3 to account for
heterogenous national characteristics and international interactions.
Three types of future work could extend from the methodology and
literature synthesis. The causal pathway examined in this chapter could
be further detailed by re-applying the methodology using the
institutional breakdown set of societal collapse proxies instead of the ﻿
population loss set. The methodology, using either set of societal
collapse proxies, could be applied to detail other causal pathways
between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. The methodology,
excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could be applied to
document the information in the historical studies identified in the
literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be applied to
construct CLDs at different scales and granularities. It is hoped that
this chapter has contributed to developing our understanding of the
causal pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses an ﻿ existential risk
to humanity and facilitates opportunities for future work. [\[REFERENCES

chapter the authors draw on several research strands and papers within
CSER to offer a theoretical reflection on how to think about
catastrophic climate change and what Existential Risk Studies can learn
from climate change research. • [This is **intended to build** on the
**previous chapter**]{.underline}, [in which Catherine
Richards]{.underline}, Richard Lupton, and Julian Allwood [provide an
empirical assessment of one **highly concerning**]{.underline} [risk
cascade]{.underline} involving climate change and highlight its
potential contribution to global catastrophic and existential risk. •
Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and has
deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster risk
management, environmental studies, and food security. • Drawing on these
studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to frame research
questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic climate change
to be neglected by climate and existential risk researchers alike, and
how to incorporate assessments of response risk and co-benefits into
thinking about catastrophic climate change. This short chapter brings
together a number of important ideas and draws readers attention to
other extant bodies of literature. The relative value of ﻿ co-benefits
approaches is discussed in other chapters in this volume, including
Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of ﻿ response risks are further
discussed in Chapter 2. 1. [Asking the **Wrong Questions** for the
**Right Reasons** **Within**]{.underline} [Existential Risk Studies it
is common to hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "is ﻿ climate
change an ﻿ existential risk?"]{.underline}, and [many]{.underline} who
ask this question [answer **negatively**]{.underline},
[arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿ climate change is not an
important topic of research **within the field**]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered affirmatively or
not,]{.underline} [this question is **misguided**]{.underline}. There
are three reasons for thinking this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes
little sense on a **probabilistic** level]{.underline}; whether
something will be [a threat to]{.underline} our [collective existence is
not]{.underline} a [**binary** matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of
likelihood]{.underline}. However, **[many researchers]{.underline}**
[within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly**]{.underline} [conflict ﻿
existential risk with **events**]{.underline} [that could be existential
﻿catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate]{.mark}
change is not a **single uniform process**]{.underline} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [it is a set of **diffuse
impacts**]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating]{.mark} different **[risk ﻿
cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Richards et al. show, [it
[will]{.mark} inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a **host** of [other
threats]{.mark} (not only ﻿ **food security** and **societal
collapse**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [volcanic eruptions or]{.underline}
the [emergence of **zoonotic pathogens**),]{.underline}1 and [these can
**interact**]{.underline} with one another [to [create
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or
**"[global]{.mark} systems [death spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2
Finally, "﻿ existential risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for
the question to ever be answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential
risk that have received the greatest public attention thus far, such as
Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not in terms of an impact on humanity at any point
in time but rather in terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3
either referring to the author(s) particular vision of a high-tech
intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

**Dogan, 2022** (Haluk Dogan 2/22/22. PhD candidate in Strategy and
Security within the Department of Politics at the University of Exeter,

provoked the Russian invasion to maintain its global primacy."

ADA-62)

[In a moot effort to cling to its hegemony and keep NATO relevant,
Washington]{.underline} has, in turn, [allowed the invasion to
happen]{.underline}.

Following a long period of escalation, Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} has ordered troops into Eastern Ukraine's two
breakaway regions, prompting immediate Western condemnation and an
emergency UN Security Council meeting. While Moscow stands accused by
the West of increasing acts of aggression on the Ukrainian border, the
[invasion was **not a one-sided event**]{.underline}.

For months, [the Anglo-American bloc has been **unwilling to
de-escalate** the crisis]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} and
London have [aimed to resuscitate the case for]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} alliance, to invalidate arguments for a separate
European Union-wide security arrangement, [and to weaken Russia in
seeking to prevent the emergence of rival blocs]{.underline} in Eurasia
and the Asia-Pacific regions.

However, to put it bluntly, **[this strategy will not reverse the
decline of American hegemony]{.underline}**.

Is the 'transatlantic alliance' back?

A couple of days before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy expressed his disappointment at the failure of his Western
"friends" to support Ukraine vis-a-vis Russian aggression. This
perception is consistent with Ukrainian officials' previous accusation
that US President Joe Biden gave Moscow a "green light" to invade.

Kiev's disappointment is completely understandable.

Giving Moscow the green light is as much about transatlantic relations
as it is about West-Russia or Ukraine-Russia relations. [The US'
post-World War II hegemony is predicated on its domination in
continental Europe, with NATO acting as the principal mechanism for
achieving American primacy]{.underline}.

The Anglo-American strategy now focuses on preventing European states
from acting independently. The Russian threat is thought to serve that
aim, pushing Europe to be in need of American and British power.

The Anglo-American bloc has never been happy with France's attempts to
establish an alternative European security mechanism, or with Germany's
relations with Russia -- especially in terms of cooperation on the Nord
Stream gas pipeline. The growing economic ties between the European
Union and China are also causes of concern for the Anglo-American
alliance.

In this context, it is not surprising Biden pointed out at the 2021
Virtual Munich Security Conference: "America is back. The transatlantic
alliance is back...The partnership between Europe and the United States,
in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to
accomplish in the 21st Century, just as we did in the 20th Century."

Eliminating Russia in the 'Great Game'?

Neither NATO nor Western states will go to war with Russia over the
invasion of Ukraine. The invasion justifies their efforts to undermine
Russia economically and politically.

However, [the strategy of weakening Russia is not only about its
military activities in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has
long embraced an approach that emphasises Russia's great power status in
a multipolar world]{.underline}, in direct opposition to the US' vision
of a unipolar world in which it reigns supreme.

Therefore, [the Anglo-American goal is]{.underline} not only to weaken
Russia via economic sanctions, or harm Moscow's economic interests in
Europe, but also [to divert its attention and energy away from the Indo
and Asia-Pacific in particular, with the aim of hindering Russia's
partnerships with India and China]{.underline}.

India has decades-long ties with Russia, and New Delhi recently started
receiving Russian S-400 defence systems. But India is also a member of
Quad -- an alliance involving the US, Japan, and Australia, which aims
to counter China's growing assertiveness. Both the US and Britain have
long been pushing India to cooperate with them in dealing with China.

At the last Quad meeting, the US requested that India stand by its side
in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Another important topic
for discussion was the growing economic and diplomatic relationships
between Russia and China.

[The Anglo-American bloc hopes that the Ukraine invasion will severely
wound Russia, preventing it from being an important rival actor in their
confrontation with China]{.underline}.

The question of American decline

Anglo-American domination will push Europe into submission to some
extent, and Russia will be wounded. But will this reverse the
unravelling of American hegemony in the long term?

As Russian President Vladimir [Putin made clear]{.underline} in his
televised speech just before the invasion, [sanctions imposed by the
West will not dissuade Russia from attempting to preserve its standing
on the world stage]{.underline}.

[NATO has already **lost prestige and power**, and the invasion of
Ukraine will only **worsen this situation**]{.underline}. [Increasing
the Anglo-American bloc's weight in Europe due to the conflict in
Eastern Europe will also have a **negative impact on their ability to
contain China**]{.underline} in Asia.

As it follows Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russia's invasion of
Ukraine will not cause France to abandon its call for strategic autonomy
for the EU entirely, nor will it change the interdependence of Europe
and Russia on gas.

The Anglo-American coalition's gas diversification efforts in favour of
Europe will affect the strategic dynamics in the Mediterranean and the
Middle East. Yet it is not likely to obstruct the Nord Stream 2 project,
despite Washington wanting to see this. [Due to the steady erosion of
the US' hegemonic position in the world economy]{.underline}, it appears
that [China will continue to be the EU's biggest trading
partner]{.underline}.

[India has already signalled that it will remain neutral on]{.underline}
the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis, which implies that Russia's invasion
of Ukraine will have little impact on the close ties between Moscow and
New Delhi.

More crucially, [this situation appears to have given Moscow and Beijing
**further reasons to act together and get closer**]{.underline}, despite
their conflicting interests in Asia. They share a common desire to
challenge the Western-dominated international system. Should Russia be
wounded by Western sanctions, it will rely on China in economic terms to
some extent, while their collective security actions will hasten the
demise of US hegemony.

In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is no absolute
winner. Indeed, **[nothing will change in terms of the ongoing and
gradual unravelling of global American hegemony]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Heg Bad -- Global Governance

#### U.S. hegemony provokes [blowback aggression]{.underline} due to [status insecurity]{.underline} and [dooms global governance]{.underline}\-\--decline spurs a [great power concert]{.underline} that solves [war]{.underline} and [existential threats]{.underline}.

**Pampinella, 2019** (Stephen Pampinella 19. Assistant Professor of
Political Science and International Relations at the State University of
New York (SUNY) at New Paltz, 1/23/19. "The Internationalist Disposition
and US Grand Strategy."
https://thedisorderofthings.com/2019/01/23/the-internationalist-disposition-and-us-grand-strategy/,
ADA-63)

But in recent weeks, establishment voices have sought to reassert their
control over foreign policy debates by arguing for the necessity of [US
hegemony]{.underline} and classic liberal internationalist forms of
cooperation. Colás' methodological internationalism illustrates why
traditional US foreign policy approaches **[will fail to provide actual
security]{.underline}** for ordinary Americans. It also suggests
(somewhat counterintuitively) what kinds of grand strategies could do
so. A [great power concert]{.underline} strategy, in which the United
States pursues a balance of power among its rivals while committing to
more democratic forms of international cooperation, [can **best
resolve**]{.underline} the non-state **[threats]{.underline}** to US
democracy generated by its own liberal order.

The New Internationalism of the American Left

Colás describes methodological internationalism as a focus on
macrostructural processes like capitalism or difference-based
hierarchies which transcend state borders and generate worldwide
categorical inequalities. We can contrast this perspective with
methodological nationalism, the idea that the main units of analysis in
world politics are nation-states. But rather than assume that
international relations (IR) is about neatly bounded sovereigns pursuing
their interests as autonomous actors, methodological internationalism
privileges networks of social relations that constitute subjectivities
in world politics. It refuses to accept that actors are constituted
prior to their interactions with others and recognizes that the
boundaries separating inside/outside are social constructs. What we see
in domestic politics, including various struggles against economic
exploitation and in defense of the environment and marginalized peoples,
are really foreign policy problems that simply manifest themselves in a
particular social context. This radical version of internationalism
suggests that [resolving our societies' problems will require
establishing democratic control over global processes]{.underline} on
the basis of solidarity and respect for difference.

The emerging discussion around progressive internationalism builds upon
this disposition. For example, Bernie Sanders and Yanis Varoufakis call
for a global movement to revive democracy and oppose growing
authoritarianism in the United States and Europe. Daniel Nexon argues
that progressive multilateralists and anti-hegemony leftists can form a
new foreign policy coalition that aims to lessen inequality through the
deconcentration of economic power. Heather Hurlburt demonstrates that
the United States can no longer pursue trade openness for the benefit of
capital at the expense of workers as a means of extending its influence
across the globe. All these ideas are consistent with methodological
internationalism. [Given the **scale of transnational threats** like
inequalities produced by global capitalism and catastrophic climate
change, a true progressive internationalism would prioritize intensive
cooperation with other state and non-state actors to collectively
regulate these global processes]{.underline}. The purpose of national
security policy, then, would be to de-escalate great power competition
as a means of enabling economic and ecological security.

Why Liberal Internationalism Will Fail (Again)

But in recent weeks, mainstream US foreign policy experts have provided
their own spin in progressive internationalism. [Advocates]{.underline}
and practitioners [of a traditional hegemonic foreign
policy]{.underline} have sought to co-opt progressive internationalism
in a series of essays which argue for the necessity of American power
and global influence. These writers [embody the post-Cold War centrist
foreign policy coalition of liberal internationalists and
neocons]{.underline}ervatives. For them, that the greatest threat to the
democratic "free" world created by the United States remains the
autocratic governance model of Russia and China. While Washington should
pursue cooperation on transnational governance issues where possible,
they argue it cannot do so at the expense of making security concessions
which would reward revisionist behavior by great power rivals. As in the
past, [American exceptionalism remains the identity narrative justifying
a return to US hegemony]{.underline}, with Anglo-American norms serving
as the basis for hegemonic socialization and cooperation.

The internationalist disposition is a reminder of why a mere social
democratic twist on US hegemony will fail to provide actual security for
the United States and its allies. Establishment voices continue to rely
on state-centric assumptions about IR and ignore how state identities
and interests are a function of their relationship with each other. Or,
as Jennifer Mitzen and Michelle Murray might argue, [the revisionist
intentions of Russia and China are a **product of their ontological
insecurity**]{.underline}. [A hegemonic U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [defending an Anglo-American order denies them
recognition of their own great power identities and their right to
participate in]{.underline} all deliberations about [global
order]{.underline}. From this perspective, [we should challenge
the]{.underline} implicit [assumption]{.underline} made by Anthony
Blinken and Robert Kagan [that Russia is revisionist by
nature]{.underline}. An internationalist perspective suggests that
[Russia has adopted those intentions in relation to]{.underline} [a
Wilsonian U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [which seeks
domination over Moscow]{.underline} and the transformation of its
political system. [The same is true for China,]{.underline} which
rejects being cast as a "responsible stakeholder" by Washington which
would eventually accept democracy following its internal transformation
by global capitalism. In other words, the very terms of US relations
with these states over the past 25 years is the source of their
revisionist intentions, and not some essentialized feature of their
domestic politics.

Further, a liberal exceptionalist narrative that contrasts "Eastern
autocracy" with "Western freedom" masks how [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has **perpetuated its own systems of illiberal
dominance throughout its history**]{.underline}. [Those same structures
of oppression are the greatest threat to contemporary US democracy and
also serve as glaring evidence of US hypocrisy]{.underline}. In his
defense of American exceptionalism, Jake Sullivan represents
institutional racism as a bug rather than a feature of the American
political system by emphasizing the liberal ideals of the Founders and
casting Donald Trump's white ethnonationalism as an aberration. But
[this telling of the American story whitewashes the long history of an
exclusive, white ethnic US identity]{.underline} dating back to the
early 19th Century and its role in generating the modern United States.
Scholars of American political development and US history have long
demonstrated that [institutions of slavery and land conquest constituted
US society and made possible its economic prosperity]{.underline} rather
than some kind of intrinsic tendency toward freedom.

Fast-forward to the present: liberal exceptionalism further denies how
[economic globalization made possible the rise of
**authoritarianism**]{.underline}. Nils Gilman and David Klion rightly
argue that the [kleptocratic alliance between autocrats and
oligarchs]{.underline} is the true threat to democracy and rule of law.
Their [ability to concentrate political and economic power has been
enabled by the emergence of an integrated global market that privileges
the freedom of capital over the needs of ordinary people, one **created
by the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates when liberal
internationalism went global after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Finally, [attempts to revive US hegemony will **doom transnational
efforts to deal with existential non-state threats**]{.underline}.
Hegemonists like Thomas Wright argue that Russia and China are the
greatest threat to the United States, and that Washington should never
make concessions to either power as a means of ensuring cooperation on
issues of global governance. However, "ring-fencing" global capitalism
and climate change as separate issues will fail to achieve the necessary
level of cooperation to cope with these threats. [National security
policymakers cannot recognize that the greatest dangers]{.underline}
faced by US citizens [are non-state economic and ecological global
processes that shape domestic politics]{.underline} from the inside-out,
[and **not rival sovereigns**]{.underline}. [Economic destitution to the
point of embracing fascist dictators coupled with environmental collapse
are]{.underline} near-certain [non-state threats which transcend our
boundaries]{.underline} -- in fact, [as a global power, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has been **complicit in
creating them**]{.underline}.

The internationalist disposition would suggest that the priorities of US
foreign policy must change. [Regulating global processes]{.underline}
should be the primary objective, and it [requires]{.underline} that the
United States pursue intense [macro]{.underline}-levels of [cooperation
with all other states, **including**]{.underline} its
**[rivals]{.underline}**, to achieve them. Yet [it will be unlikely to
do so if it remains]{.underline} wedded to liberal hegemony and
**[consumed by great power competition]{.underline}**. [Short-term
incentives to accumulate resources and power will override the long-term
need for global governance. The result will be a world whose people live
in precarity, **ravaged by climate change, and constantly on the verge
of great power war**]{.underline}.

From "Disposition" to "Grand Strategy"

The internationalist disposition clearly illustrates why old US
strategies are incompatible with the progressive internationalism of the
US left. However, contra Colás, progressives should not avoid developing
of a positive vision for foreign policy due to the diverse range of
radical perspectives. To do so would cede pro-restraint arguments to
structural realist and libertarian advocates of offshore balancing who
offer no template for global engagement or institutional cooperation.
What progressives must do is articulate a grand strategy, or a plan that
mobilizes all elements of national power and influence, grounded in a
relationalist ontology that combines restraint with internationalism.
This strategy must be post-hegemonic (a term even Ikenberry has flirted
with), post-statist, and supportive of intense international cooperation
based on the diversity of identities and values otherwise ignored by the
universalist pretenses of Anglo-American liberalism. If our very
existence is mutually dependent on others, then we need a foreign policy
based on solidarity in response to collectively experienced threats.

I think there is a strategy consistent with the international
disposition: [great power concert]{.underline}. A concert strategy
[requires that all great powers pursue mutual accommodation and
recognize each other's interests as part of a larger commitment to
maintain international stability]{.underline}. Patrick Porter and Amitav
Acharya argue that a [great power concert]{.underline} strategy [is the
best suited to adapt to]{.underline} the transfer of wealth and power to
Asia along with [the "multiplex" nature of world politics]{.underline}
(not to mention a global perspective on international relations). [The
emergence of a diverse range of state and non-state actors bound
together by extreme interdependence makes it **impossible**
for]{.underline} any one actor, such as [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [to establish rules for global governance which
can mobilize all others]{.underline}. On this basis[, a concert strategy
would lead the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
**collaborate with others** on the basis of mutual co-existence and
**embrace joint decision-making** at the global level for coping with
macrostructural processes that threaten all peoples around the
world]{.underline}. In this way, a concert strategy is firmly grounded
the international disposition and can serve as the realization of
progressive internationalism.

Security and The Balance of Power

[A concert strategy can]{.underline} do what establishment foreign
policy cannot, namely **[de-escalate great power competition by giving
up US hegemony]{.underline}**. If adopted, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would treat other great powers, like Russia,
China, and Iran, as **equal partners in the maintenance of global
stability** and incorporate their interests into regional security
agreements]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would give up its self-assumed role as an
unrivaled global hegemon]{.underline} [and seek a balance of power based
on mutual respect with other great powers as partners]{.underline}
rather than enemies. This kind of international posture would result in
a more horizontal great power system, one that Stacie Goddard as
identified as being productive of status quo rather than revisionist
intentions. [It would]{.underline} be compatible with recognition of the
great power identities of other states and [provide]{.underline} them
with **[ontological security]{.underline}**.

#### Global governance solves emerging tech, pandemics, and war\-\--the impact is extinction. 

**Bailey, 2018** (Robert Bailey, professional technologist and strategic
manager who has led initiatives to improve the delivery of civic
services in major North American cities, Master of Science Degree in
Computer science, 9/5/18. "Why do we need global governance?"
https://www.visionofearth.org/social-change/global-governance/, ADA-64)

[Global governance is necessary because humanity increasingly faces both
problems and opportunities that are global in scale]{.underline}. Today,
[transnational problems such as violence and pandemics]{.underline}
routinely **[reach across borders]{.underline}**, affecting us all. At
the same time, [the]{.underline} increasingly [integrated global system
has also laid the necessary foundations for peace and spectacular
prosperity]{.underline}. [Effective global governance will allow us to
end armed conflict, deal with new and emerging problems such as
tech]{.underline}nological [risks and automation]{.underline}, [and to
achieve levels of prosperity and progress never before
seen]{.underline}.1

[The most important challenge for humanity to overcome is that of
**existential risks**]{.underline}. One way to look at the danger of an
existential risk is to quantify the level of global coordination needed
to deal with it. While best-shot risks, at one end of the spectrum only
require that a single nation, organization or even individual (i.e.,
superhero) has the means and the will to save everyone, weakest-link
risks, at the other end of the spectrum, are dangers that might require
literally every country to take appropriate action to prevent
catastrophe, with no room for failure.2 3

[We've always been at risk of natural disaster, but with advances in our
level of technology the risk we pose to ourselves as a species becomes
ever greater]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons are a well-known risk that
we still live with]{.underline} to this day. The progress of
[tech]{.underline}nological [research exposes us to new dangers such as
**bioengineered superbugs**, **nanotech**]{.underline}nological menaces,
[and the risk of an out-of-control a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [with ill-intent]{.underline}.
[Increased]{.underline} levels of [global coordination are needed to
combat]{.underline} many of [these]{.underline} risks, as described in
our article on the cooperation possibilities frontier.

There are other problems that don't necessarily threaten the species or
even civilization as we know it, but which are holding back the
development of prosperity and progress. Armed conflict, around since the
dawn of history, still haunts us today. Even though wars between great
powers appear to be a thing of the past, [regional conflicts still
account for tremendous human suffering and loss of life]{.underline} in
parts of the world without stable governance.4

Other problems have emerged precisely because of our successes in the
past. The unprecedented advancement of human wellbeing and prosperity
over the past century has been based in large part on the use of fossil
fuels, thus exposing us to climate change. [Widespread
automation]{.underline}, already a stressor on society, [will put
increased pressure on the social and economic fabric of our
societies]{.underline} over the next few decades. [Global governance can
help **alleviate these issues**]{.underline} in various ways -- we refer
the interested reader to the very detailed work in Ruling Ourselves.

Finally, global governance will increasingly be judged not only by the
extent to which it prevents harm, but also by its demonstrated ability
to improve human wellbeing.5 Progress has let us set our sights higher
as a species, both for what we consider to be the right trajectory for
humanity and for our own conduct.6 Major advances in human wellbeing can
be accomplished with existing technology and modest improvements in
global coordination.

[Effective global governance]{.underline} is global governance that
**[tackles these issues better than the regional governments of the
world can independently]{.underline}**. [Global governance is key to
solving global problems. Without it, we **may not be able to avoid
weakest-link existential risks** or regulate new and dangerous
tech]{.underline}nologies. [With it, we may be able to prosper as we
never have befor]{.underline}e. The next step is to determine how
effective global governance can be achieved.

mess, but it must act quickly: [Washington needs]{.underline} to develop
a recalibrated foreign policy tailored to America's [more **limited

global environment. While the government and American policy elites
might not be ready to hear this message, sooner or later they will have

developing a U.S. foreign policy that promotes American values while
being more attuned to Washington's attenuated influence. [An

of a long-term trend. American hegemony, while not fully expired, is in
retreat. The United States must contend with an increasingly dynamic
global balance of power[. In the emerging world order[, it is **no
longer possible** for **one**]{.mark}]{.underline} or a few dominant
**[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [[to **impose** their will]{.mark}
on]{.underline} smaller **[countries]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} on
the swelling array of [**hybrid** and **nonstate actors**]{.underline}
that populate modern-day wars. Many so-called [middle
powers]{.underline} choose to [balance]{.underline} multiple,
overlapping [alliances]{.underline} over preferential relationships with
Washington. As the international order is transformed, the United States
looks increasingly like just one player, albeit a significantly powerful
one, among many. This moment of transition contains elements of both
risk and reward for the United States. On the one hand, America is
well-placed to be a leader in the new international order. It is still
the most powerful country with the most alliances, the most attractive
economy, a huge military footprint, and a dominant platform in world
culture. Washington needs to develop a recalibrated foreign policy
tailored to America's more limited power. But Washington will only be a
beneficiary of the new order if it is willing to change the way it
approaches its foreign policy. And right now, the rules-based order
Washington claims to represent and the United States' already damaged
moral authority---an important pillar of its international
influence---both look increasingly tenuous. In a previous commentary,
"Time to Discard the Bad Policy That Enabled the Gaza War," we drew on
conversations with dozens of policy experts and officials to map the
roots of American policy misalignment in the Middle East. We argued
that, before October 7, the United States had bought into the idea that
the Middle East could be stabilized by a mixture of realpolitik,
economic self-interest, authoritarianism, and managing rather than
resolving wars, including the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. We argued
that [[the American **approach** has]{.mark} proven
**counterproductive**, increasing **challenges**]{.underline} to U.S.
interests and [international **standing**, and [lead]{.mark}ing
[to]{.mark} an unending cycle of **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that spread human misery [while **deepening**]{.underline} the Middle
East's [strategic **malaise**.]{.underline} Until now, [Washington has
refused to acknowledge its shrinking **hegemony**. It has tried to stay
the course]{.underline}, and [ended up]{.underline} in an even weaker
position: [**[multiple wars]{.underline}**,]{.mark} severely eroded
moral authority, [and increasing **[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Here, we argue that the United States can negotiate these changes and
still maximize its global influence, but only if it changes its approach
to foreign policy. Mismatched Ambitions and Influence Simply put, [a
**realignment**]{.underline} of the international order [is
**underway**]{.underline}, and American foreign policy is not keeping
up. At least since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, American foreign policy
has been [out of sync with U.S. capabilities]{.underline}: Even when its
power was undisputed, the United States was unable to act as the world's
policeman, but nevertheless sought to assert itself as the indispensable
global power. [A series of [**events**, bad **policies**, and
**setbacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the 2003
invasion---**[[painful]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only [[for
America's]{.mark} self-[image]{.mark}]{.underline} but for many
communities destabilized or destroyed in the shockwaves---have been
insufficient to force a correction. Now, [a more **multipolar** order is
**emerging**]{.underline}, one in which the United States is likely to
remain a preeminent player, perhaps the single most influential state.
But Washington will no longer be able to determine outcomes or assume
that its economic and political heft insulate it from paying major costs
for its missteps. U.S. government officials and many in the policy elite
acknowledge that the world is changing. But they are not quite ready to
contemplate, at least in public, an American strategy that accepts a
more modest understanding of U.S. influence; or that accepts that
Washington will have to triage its priorities on the global stage.
President Trump's "America First" and President Biden's "foreign policy
for the middle class" had one thing in common: neither acknowledged that
U.S. power is in relative decline. Despite many differences, both
doctrines began with a false belief that Washington could sustain
international dominance at minimal cost and risk. Like pre-October 7
Middle East policy, these ambitious proposals to reconfigure U.S.
foreign policy all too often disintegrate on contact with the real
world. Sooner or later, one U.S. administration or another will have to
confront reality: [there is **no**]{.underline} magic [**formula** that
will allow]{.underline} [**the** U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to maintain its current level of **global power**
and **influence**]{.underline}, prioritize its national interests and
domestic politics, [and continue to project]{.underline} moral
[authority without incurring huge]{.underline}, politically unpalatable
[costs]{.underline}. At least since the invasion of Iraq, U.S. foreign
policy has been out of sync with its capabilities. The good news is that
the United States can maintain its position of global leadership. Less
welcome news is that this will mean a painful rethink of America's place
in the world and a different sort of leadership than the kind the United
States displayed during the Cold War and the decades after it. Instead,
it must act more like France and Germany do in the EU, or American
automakers eventually did in response to globalization: leading as the
first among equals in a competitive marketplace, and recognizing the
outer limits of its influence and power. Crucially, the United States
must understand the American value-add relative to other countries, by
genuinely prioritizing issues like multilateralism and human rights that
are core to its identity, and which its competitors disregard. If it can
strike the right balance, the United States can accomplish important
good for the world while pursuing its own interests and acknowledging
the interests and priorities of other countries. The Middle East would
be a good place to pilot this new foreign policy---not only because the
current violence and crisis demand better policies, but also because it
is in the Middle East that U.S. aspirations are most strikingly
misaligned with actual American power. A New Approach A new American
approach would prioritize global cooperation to meet the sweeping
structural challenges of our age. In bilateral relations with other
states, the United States ought to recenter values. To execute this new
approach, the U.S. government would have to set realistic expectations
about what American power can achieve in regions like the Middle East.
Neither the United States nor Israel, for example, can dismantle
Hamas---especially not with the current war in Gaza. The brutal military
campaign has become an exercise in radicalizing the Palestinian
population against Israel and the United States, and is driving the
Middle East into region-wide conflict. What is within American power is
putting a stop to the Gaza war---not just pausing the fighting---and
pursuing a political settlement to the Israeli--Palestinian conflict,
based on international law (including the 1967 borders), that reduces
the chance of mass violence by any party. These actions would
significantly improve regional security, and American standing in the
Middle East and the world, while taking away a significant pillar of
anti-American groups' platforms. The genuine pursuit of peace would also
be politically and financially costly, and take years across multiple
U.S. administrations. The United States needs to acknowledge that it
cannot achieve its goals alone, and must seek to share the
burden---including with key international competitors. America needs to
reframe Middle Eastern conflict and instability as a global systemic
issue on a par with COVID-19 or climate change, and seek a genuinely
multilateral response that includes rival superpowers, including, for
example, China. For years, China has been a free-rider on American
security guarantees in the Middle East while lambasting Washington for
its regional policies, including on Israel--Palestine, propping up
Iran's economy, and seeking improved relations with American allies and
partners. Beijing clearly has a vested interest in the stability of a
region that is essential to its energy supply and the global trade
routes that underpin its export-led economy, and has dipped its toes
into mediation in the region. The United States should push for more‚ by
publicly calling on the four other permanent members of the UN Security
Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom) to join Washington
in supporting an Israeli--Palestinian peace process that includes a
prominent role for regional mediation, and a Middle Eastern security
framework that they jointly guarantee, with the United States and China
taking the lead. Actively encouraging autocratic competitor states to
become more involved in the region might appear to be counter to U.S.
interests and values. But a multilateral diplomatic effort on
Israel--Palestine, and the development of a regional security
architecture guaranteed by the Security Council that prioritizes
conflict resolution and regional detente, would free the United States
to stand up for its core values in ways that it struggles to achieve
when it acts alone. The United States is often hesitant to push its
regional allies to comply with international humanitarian or human
rights law, because it fears it will lose influence over their behavior,
or that they might realign toward competitors like China. The Biden
administration hoped its post-October 7 bear hug of Israel would provide
it with influence over the military campaign in Gaza. But it hasn't
worked at all---Israel's assault has been merciless, and it is now
bearing down on Rafah, the last refuge of more than 1.5 million
Palestinians. Meanwhile, keeping China completely out of the region is a
lost cause: many regional players, including Israel and U.S. partners
like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are already seeking
improved relations with China, and will continue to do so in future.
Washington could secure its core strategic interests---trade and
energy---with the other elements of this policy shift in place: A peace
process would be underway in the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. The new
security architecture would improve regional stability and, crucially,
catalyze conflict resolution rather than merely managing conflict.
Regional conflict between global superpowers would be somewhat
mitigated. Washington could then condition military and other forms of
support to its regional allies and partners (for example, Egypt, Israel,
and Saudi Arabia) on improved human rights and rule of law. In doing so,
it would also call the bluff of partners who have tacitly threatened to
defect to the Chinese or Russian camp, but know that neither Beijing nor
Moscow is willing or able to provide the kind of security guarantees the
U.S currently does. No More Hegemony on the Cheap A dose of realism
would be required to successfully push for multilateral peace-brokering
and stability initiatives while pursuing a values-based bilateral
foreign policy. These policies would by no means achieve perfect
outcomes, and would require the United States to accept some big
up-front costs, including increased regional influence for its rivals
and turbulent relations with long-standing partners. Yet failure to
correct the course would have much worse consequences. [[If Washington
continues]{.mark} on its **current path**]{.underline} in the Middle
East, [[it will remain on the **hook** for]{.mark} **regional
[security]{.mark}** as its influence fades]{.underline} and China and
Russia continue to exploit conflicts to their own benefit. The reality
is that [[if]{.mark} American **[leaders]{.mark}** continue to
**[pursue]{.mark}** a policy of **[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} on
the cheap, while shunning other powers' help on major structural issues,
the American competitive advantage in world affairs will continue to
shrink. [[Washington will be **viewed** as]{.mark} just another
**[self-interested]{.mark} power**]{.underline} among many, one
struggling to maintain alliances with states whose values do not align
with its own, yet unable to make some of the transactional
accommodations that nondemocratic competitors have no problem making.
The American government and policy elite might not yet be ready to
openly espouse a strategy that accepts the limits to U.S. influence and
opens doors to competitors. But the realignment of relative world power
is already underway, and in practice [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has two
obvious choices. It [[can]{.mark} **double down**]{.underline} on the
status quo, and continue [**pretending** it is still the]{.underline}
world's sole **[superpower]{.underline}** while paying lip service to
values that it fails to back with meaningful policies---thus
**[[forfeit]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** still [more [**influence**.
Or]{.mark} it can **[embrace]{.mark} change**]{.underline}, steer [into
[the]{.mark} multipolar **[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and seek
[[to lead]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in partnership with
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} strong [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark},
and as a force for good in the world. Political constraints make it
easier to stay on the current, flawed path, at least in the short term.
But the best choice is clear: [a more **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
international **[[role]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the United States
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[be]{.mark} the
braver]{.underline} and **[[more effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[policy.]{.underline}

#### Containment [trades off]{.underline} with domestic investments, which makes collapse inevitable

**Shifrinson 21**, Assistant Professor of International Relations at
Boston University. (Joshua R. Itzkowitz, Winter 2021, "Neo-Primacy and
the Pitfalls of US Strategy toward China", *The Washington Quarterly*,
43:4, 90-91)

The US Faces Domestic Constraints Third, [neo-primacy is of
**questionable domestic sustainability**]{.underline}---indeed, [it has
the potential to **undermine** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} [own strength]{.underline}.
Independent of competition with China, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates likely [**[needs]{.mark} substantial
[investments]{.mark}** [in **healthcare**, **education**, and
**infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline} (among others) over the coming
decades. Although some of these could be funded as part of a
neo-primacist competition with China, [other social
programs]{.underline} ([e.g., Social Security and public
pensions]{.underline}) [are likely to require additional funding,
particularly as US demographics change]{.underline}.59 [This situation
is further exacerbated as bills come due for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} **[prior spending]{.underline}**; as
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported [even
**before**]{.underline} the **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic
[**reduced revenue** and **increased borrowing**]{.underline}, [by
2028]{.underline} "[[the]{.mark} \[Federal\] [government will spend
**more on**]{.mark} **net [interest]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} it will
spend on either **[defense]{.mark}** or **nondefense discretionary
outlays**]{.underline}." 60 Of course, the United States can service its
financial obligations by raising taxes, accepting additional debt, or
both.61 Unless the US economy grows faster than US obligations, however,
the United States will face a difficult choice in the years ahead. On
the one hand, policymakers can constrain the funding available for
foreign activities in order to devote the marginal resource to domestic
needs. In this situation, [neo-[primacy could prove **unsustainable**,
as the **resources** ]{.mark}**needed** to compete with China for
international dominance at a time of declining US relative power [prove
lacking]{.mark} due to **internal demands**]{.underline}. [The United
States would then risk taking on foreign obligations and exacerbating
tensions with China without the wherewithal to service these
missions.]{.underline} On the other hand, [policymakers might opt to
**suppress domestic consumption** to fund the contest with
China]{.underline}. Here, however, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[could]{.mark} end up **[harm]{.mark}ing
[its]{.mark} long-term [competitiveness]{.mark}** [by
**foregoing**]{.mark} the sort of socio-economic [spending that would
ensure]{.mark} US **[economic and military
dynamism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In effect, [current [military
consumption]{.mark} would **[crowd out]{.mark} future [domestic
investment]{.mark}**. Neo-[primacy]{.mark} then [risks]{.mark} being
left unworkable by [**dragging down** the]{.mark} **underlying
[foundations of]{.mark} US [strength]{.mark}** over time.]{.underline}
To be sure, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[' ability to
borrow at favorable rates while attracting foreign investment can
moderate the intensity with which these guns-versus-butter choices have
to be made. Still, they **do not eliminate the problem**]{.underline}.
[All spending choices entail **opportunity costs**, and there are
grounds to believe neo-primacy's costs leave the approach
**unworkable**.]{.underline}

Crisis Facilitates Change The case studies show that [[**crisis** is
a]{.mark} great **[driver]{.mark} and facilitator** [of
**change**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that foreign policy
[[leaders]{.mark} should]{.underline} have an idea of how they might
[use a **crisis** to **open** or foreclose **opportunities** to
[shift]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The case of 9/11 makes
the importance of crises unmistakably clear, but international crises
spurred change in the NSC-68 and Vietnam War cases as well. There is
truth in the adage "Never let a good crisis go to waste." [Crises
[generate]{.mark} **policy [plasticity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, opening
the door to strategic change. [[Absent]{.mark} a
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, a president seeking [[significant
**changes** in **fo**]{.mark}reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [faces a much
**harder task**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider [the impact
of]{.underline} the outbreak of [[the **Korean War**]{.mark} on U.S.
Cold War strategy]{.underline}. The hawkish global approach that Nitze
developed in NSC-68 initially faced opposition inside and outside the
government. The plan was basically shelved in the spring of 1950, and it
gained new life only when the Korean War erupted in June. North Korea's
invasion of South Korea seemed to support NSC-68's central claim that
the United States could not afford to focus solely on competition with
the Soviet Union in Europe. The outbreak of [the war]{.underline} also
[created a sense of urgency]{.underline} that NSC-68's advocates used to
turn their strategy into a reality. [As a **result**, the **U**nited
**S**tates adopted a more **geographically expansive** and
**military-centered conception** of how to wage the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. [The **9/11 attacks** provide an even more clear-cut
case]{.underline} of how a foreign policy crisis fosters major change.
The terrorist attacks created so strong a national desire to punish
al-Qaeda and to prevent another assault on American soil as to give the
Bush administration as close to a free hand in foreign policy as any
presidency since the Second World War. [The White House **used** the
crisis]{.underline} not just to put a higher priority on
counterterrorism but also [to **increase** defense **spending** and
**implement** a **neoconservative** grand **strategy**]{.underline}
aimed at building democracy in the Middle East through military force.
Conversely, [[Carter's]{.mark} **failed [attempt]{.mark}** [to
**withdraw**]{.mark} U.S. forces from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[illustrates]{.mark} the [**difficulty**]{.mark} of achieving
significant **change without a crisis**]{.underline} to motivate and
galvanize support for it. Carter came into office on the heels of
economic and foreign policy crises: the 1973 inflation spike and the
Vietnam War. The latter was one reason he wanted to reduce the U.S.
military posture in Asia by withdrawing forces from South Korea. By the
time he took office, however, these problems had lost intensity.
[**[Support]{.mark}** for **withdrawal** from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[**dissipated**]{.mark} over time]{.underline}, and Carter was
eventually forced to shelve the idea. Crisis is not always necessary for
major change. The Biden administration withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021
in the absence of a foreign policy crisis. It decided to withdraw U.S.
forces in the first year of the administration, during a honeymoon
period when the president still enjoyed strong support from his own
party and control of Congress. The policy had also been pursued by
Trump, making it more difficult for Republicans in Congress to criticize
the withdrawal harshly. By 2021, moreover, evidence that the United
States was not achieving its stated objectives in Afghanistan had piled
up over the years, weakening resistance to change and making withdrawal
popular among a large majority of the American public. Why do
**[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** facilitate change? One reason is that
they tend to [[**generate**]{.mark} an **emotional [impetus]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}for action]{.underline}[, [making
**people**]{.underline}]{.mark} [more likely to [**rethink**]{.mark}
their **fundamental [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and goals. In a
time of crisis, [[the public]{.mark}, Congress, [and]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark} bureaucracy [yearn for]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pressure for action is not always a good
thing, because sometimes the best policy is to avoid taking action in
the first place---in other words, to do nothing---but if the White House
is aiming for a major change, [a crisis [generates]{.mark} a
**[permissive atmosphere]{.mark}** for change to **gain
traction**]{.underline}. **[Crises]{.underline}** can also
[**[overwhelm]{.mark} existing [beliefs]{.mark}** []{.mark}with
disconfirming **info**rmation]{.underline}. In normal times, people tend
to interpret facts according to existing mental frameworks rather than
to revise the frameworks themselves. But [a crisis can cause people to
**rethink assumptions** if an existing framework has proven to be
inadequate for understanding the world]{.underline} and generated
harmful consequences.^1^ In addition, [crises [generate]{.mark} a
**sense of [urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [which can
generate]{.underline} the **[momentum]{.underline}** needed [[to
overcome inertia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts on change in businesses,
for example, have pointed out that a sense of urgency can be essential
to large-scale change because it helps generate collective action.^2^

Two [[causal mechanisms]{.mark} work to **[push even the]{.mark} most

#### Pursuit [isn't inevitable]{.underline}\-\--public beliefs are [malleable]{.underline} and [shifting]{.underline}.

[Nearly immune]{.underline}, however, [is not **immune**]{.underline}.
[Even the most **deeply held [beliefs]{.mark}** find it [difficult to
survive]{.mark} **[sustained]{.mark}**, **long‐​term [assaults]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} contradictory [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
Psychologists who have studied evolution in beliefs report that despite
occasional epiphanies that instantly change minds, like that of Saul on
the road to Damascus, generally speaking the process is very gradual,
and sometimes imperceptible.53 Individuals often recognize that a change
in their beliefs has occurred after the fact, and they resist admitting
that their minds are evolving while the process is under way. [There are
examples of **[gradual]{.mark}**,]{.underline} even generational
[[evolution of beliefs]{.mark} that can give hope to those seeking to
**expunge fear** and **indispensability** from U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} "**[[Social Darwinism]{.underline}]{.mark}**," for
instance, **[poisoned]{.underline}** [international politics for
**decades**]{.underline}. The belief that humanity was split into a
number of distinct "races" in a perpetual existential struggle where
only the fittest survive shaped the worldview of generations of
leaders.54 Social Darwinism helped justify any number of pathological
policies, from imperialism to the Holocaust, **[but]{.underline}** over
time, [it **[collapsed]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} the weight
of]{.underline} rational **[[counterargument]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence]{.underline}**. The identification of DNA
and the understanding of the genome allowed science to put social
Darwinism and its cousins, eugenics and phrenology, to rest once and for
all.55 Previously, [internalized beliefs]{.underline} about the
inevitability of competition between races [were]{.underline} slowly
[changed by]{.underline} the onslaught of **[evidence]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}**, and the understanding that
differences among peoples were cultural rather than genetic. The edifice
did not collapse all at once or with equal speed everywhere, but over
time arguments based on the foundation of social Darwinism stopped
winning popular debates on that "battlefield of beliefs," and foreign
policy behavior changed. Precedent, then, exists for evolution in
fundamental beliefs, enough for one to hope that a similar process could
eventually change popular perceptions toward modern, counterproductive
irrationalities. Precedent does not supply the only encouragement.
[Changing the dominant [U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} belief system is
perhaps **[not as daunting]{.mark} a challenge** as it may at first
seem]{.underline}, for a number of reasons. **[First]{.underline}**, as
already discussed, [[only]{.mark} a **[small number]{.mark} of
opinions** would [have to be altered to have]{.mark} a **[significant
effect]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As nice as it is to imagine that the
United States runs a democratic foreign policy, in reality not all
opinions are equally important. Altering the beliefs of the masses may
be quite difficult, but it is those of the elite that are decisive in
foreign policy; [affecting elites, if only because they are fewer in
number, might not prove to be an **insurmountable task**]{.underline}.
As influential as NSC 68 was, for instance, it was an internal document
read only by senior government officials, and it remained classified
until 1975. The various incarnations of the Committee on Present Danger
concentrated their efforts solely on the upper echelons of the foreign
policy community, and they were quite successful in affecting foreign
policy debate and practice. [Success in minimizing pathological foreign
policy behavior can occur **long before majorities** alter their
beliefs. **Second**]{.underline}, there is reason to believe that
[[foreign policy beliefs]{.mark} are **[not as entrenched as]{.mark}
some [others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many modern American
[politicians]{.mark}]{.underline} --- to say nothing of the people they
lead --- [[know **very little**]{.mark} about foreign
policy]{.underline}. The U.S. Congress is a wasteland of parochialism,
where members can even be punished for appearing to know too much about
the rest of the world.56 Those at the top of the executive branch have
been little better. The past three U.S. presidents had no background in
foreign affairs before coming into office. Bill Clinton even managed to
turn his opponent's foreign policy expertise into a liability in 1992,
claiming that it demonstrated that the elder Bush did not pay adequate
attention to domestic concerns. Eight years later, voters were unfazed
about George W. Bush's disinterest in the outside world, as manifest in
a record of foreign travel stunningly low for a child of privilege,
inability to name leaders of key countries, and devotion of only three
pages in his campaign memoir to foreign affairs.57 Although Barack Obama
spent large portions of his life abroad, he had no direct foreign policy
experience before 2008, and his 2012 opponent had even less. So although
[21st-century U.S. presidents have some predetermined beliefs about
foreign policy, their [beliefs]{.mark} are probably]{.underline} more
**[[malleable]{.underline}]{.mark}** than those of presidents who have
come to office more seasoned in matters of state. Some of the most
important, [influential minds may **not prove** to be those most
resistant to change. A third reason for hope can be found in the [early
indications from]{.mark} the [changeover in
**generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Generally speaking, [young people
are more susceptible to the possibility of]{.underline}
**[change]{.underline}**, whereas senior members of any generation are
much less likely to admit that their long‐​held theories might be wrong.
That is particularly true for senior scholars, as Thomas Kuhn has
pointed out in his study of paradigms, because they rarely prove eager
to adjust the belief systems that have served them well for so long.58
Junior members of any field are much more likely to adopt new theories
and beliefs, because they are not as invested in old ways, and they may
gain a certain bit of pleasure in tearing down the old shibboleths.59
[Public‐​opinion [polling]{.mark} has suggested that the youngest
generation of adults]{.underline}, the so‐​called millennials[, is
**[less concerned about terror]{.mark}ism** and **[less supportive
of]{.mark} an [activist fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**]{.underline}
than are its predecessors. Those between the ages of 18 and 29 are half
as likely to be concerned about Islamic fundamentalism as those over
60.60 They also appear to be less patriotic.61 It is often said that
racism is going away one funeral at a time; perhaps, too, generational
change is necessary to relieve some of the pathological popular
pressures in the arena of U.S. foreign policy debate. Finally, it is
worth emphasizing that the target of this work is the marketplace of
ideas, not the beliefs of every individual who contributes to it. The
United States does not always act pathologically, after all. [[Rational
forces]{.mark} are present alongside pathological ones in all foreign
policy discussions, and they **often [win]{.mark}** the [battle]{.mark}
over the direction of policy. It will not require a complete ideological
revolution for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
**[minimize]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[irrational

[[Planting]{.mark} the **[seeds of doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
influential minds, seeds that can germinate and grow over time, [may
well prove to be enough to tilt the balance of national debate toward
reason]{.underline}. The task of inspiring gradual improvement in U.S.
foreign policy performance, therefore, may not be as daunting as it at
first seems. In the long run, there is hope, even if few minds will
change any time soon. Thomas Jefferson once wrote, "If we think \[the
people are\] not enlightened enough to exercise control with a wholesome
discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform that
discretion."62 [One of the crucial tasks facing policymakers must be to
**inform the general public**]{.underline}, however slowly and
indirectly, of the evidence that might force its members to reexamine
their foreign policy beliefs. Because an informed public is one of the
central sine qua nons of a healthy, functioning democracy, U.S. leaders
ought to repeat the facts about the decline of warfare --- and of the
real risks associated with terrorism --- as many times as necessary for
them to become accepted.63 Although simply correcting misinformation
will not alter beliefs immediately, [over time the constituency for
reason will **grow**]{.underline}.64 Though beliefs are exceptionally
slow to change, they eventually do. [Few people still believe that the
earth is at the **center of the universe**]{.underline}, for instance,
[or that insults to honor must be answered by a **duel to the

hard to persist forever in the face of a sustained **[onslaught of

perhaps with the change of generations --- pure reason can win the
battle of beliefs, even if its victory is never certain.

Reassessing retrenchment's consequences With this more refined
understanding of retrenchment in hand, we can now turn to reassess its
international consequences. As noted in the introduction, [both pundits
and policymakers have long warned of retrenchment's immense costs which
result from the fact that it opens windows of opportunity for rivals to
improve their position in the international system]{.underline}. But
does retrenchment, indeed, regularly pave the way for rivals to acquire
important strategic assets? I argue that it does not. To make this
point, I proceed as follows. I first show that [[it is the]{.mark}
[collapse of]{.mark} a [great power's authority]{.mark}, [not]{.mark}
the [withdrawal of military force]{.mark} per se, [that]{.mark}
[presents]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
then make the case that [great powers engaging in three of the four
types of retrenchment my framework identifies should regularly be able
to avoid precipitating such authority collapse.]{.underline} Finally, I
highlight that [even when great powers engage in the one type of
retrenchment that does create such opportunities for rival gains, there
is good reason to believe that rivals will frequently not be able to
acquire these gains at negligible costs]{.underline}. What invites rival
expansion? Centering great power authority collapse In their warnings
about the dangers of strategic withdrawals, pundits and policymakers
centrally build on the assumption that whenever a great power removes
some its military capabilities from a certain geographic space, this
will open a window of opportunity allowing its rivals to expand their
influence into the area.Footnote33 In this section, I challenge this
popular belief, arguing that it is only when a great power's authority
collapses that the costs for rivals to extend their influence into the
space concerned sink dramatically. Following Weber, authority denotes
the 'legitimate exercise of imperative control' and is a function of
both material capability and legitimacy.Footnote34 The possession of
preponderant coercive capabilities and the ability to use them to issue
coercive threats is the cornerstone of any form of imperative control:
it generates widespread obedience as even those 'subjects who view the
ruler's orders as fundamentally unjust have an interest in compliance if
said orders are backed by preponderant power and the threat of
sanctions'. At the same time, stability and longevity of rule require at
least some degree of legitimacy in the sense that subjects follow the
ruler's commands quasi-voluntarily, i.e. they willingly comply with its
demands for whatever ulterior motivation and therefore do not need to be
constantly monitored and punished.Footnote35 [Historically, great powers
have exercised authority not only over their own homeland but also minor
powers and other political organisations outside of
it]{.underline}.Footnote36 Such cases of spatially extensive authority
in which great powers establish authority over other polities usually
take one of two primary forms. [First, great powers can exercise
authority through the maintenance of a formal empire]{.underline}. In
this constellation, an imperial state or metropole acquires territorial
control over political spaces outside of its own homeland and wields
authority over them as formal colonies or dependencies. Formal empires
thus involve direct rule and formal incorporation into the metropolitan
state.Footnote37 [Second, great powers sometimes exercise authority
without acquiring formal territorial control.]{.underline} [The
political spaces they rule in this manner have variably been called
their 'informal empires' or '[spheres of
influence']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote38 In these cases, a great power
exercises authority not through territorial control but through national
authorities which enter a relationship of subordination with the great
power while still retaining their nominal independence. [Just like
formal empires, these arrangements of imperial control are
[depend]{.mark}ent up[on]{.mark} both pillars of
[authority]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e. not only the ability to inspire a
sufficient degree of willing obedience but also to project preponderant
power into the space concerned. [Consider, for instance, the US sphere
of influence in Latin America]{.underline}: although the United States'
position of predominance does not require a permanent military presence
on the ground as its local subordinates generally comply with its
demands, [the stability of its rule depends crucially on its ability to
enforce its dictates militarily if push came to shove]{.underline}.
[When a great power exercises authority over a political space, this
effectively [limits]{.mark} the [ability of other]{.mark} great
power[s]{.mark} [to 'gain]{.mark} direct [access]{.mark} and control of'
the 'population and territory' it contains]{.underline}, [as rivals
could hope to extend their influence into the space only at tremendous
costs]{.underline}.Footnote39 Seizing authority over another great
power's territorial possessions would be possible only by conquering and
occupying them. Attempts to challenge a great power's control over its
sphere of influence are similarly costly. After all, its hold on
authority over these spaces implies not only that the great power is
able to project preponderant power there, but also that its rule enjoys
sufficient legitimacy. Any adversary seeking to assert control in its
stead must not only expect to trigger a military confrontation with a
peer competitor but also faces the prospect of an indigenous population
that is committed to retaining said peer competitor's rule. In the words
of Eric Forman, [by claiming authority over various geographic spaces
great powers thus erect 'fences or "hard shells" around specific
portions of the globe', effectively shielding them from the influence of
their rivals]{.underline}.Footnote40 [When a great power's authority
over a space collapses, however, this destroys the protective shell
around it]{.underline}. [Such [authority collapse can occur]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [two]{.mark} main [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
possibility is that [[the]{.mark} great [power]{.mark} [loses]{.mark}
large parts of the [material]{.mark} [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
[rule]{.mark}, i.e. it is no longer capable of projecting preponderant
material power]{.underline} into the respective space and is therefore
no longer in a position to fend off outside challenges to its position
of predominance. [The other is that [the]{.mark} [great power
experiences]{.mark} a pronounced [loss in legitimacy]{.mark}, i.e. it
loses its ability to elicit quasi-voluntary compliance with its commands
from subordinate political actors]{.underline}. As the former
subordinates turn away from the great power, they will not only refuse
to defend its rule but might even invite attempts by other powers to
oust and replace it in the hope of thus acquiring greater security or
other material as well as normative benefits for themselves. Overall,
whether the collapse of a great power's authority is due to the erosion
of its ability to project power into the space, its legitimacy, or both,
it radically alters third parties' strategic calculus: specifically, the
great power's peers realise that they now face the unique opportunity to
seek and claim control over a space that was previously impervious to
their rule. [Shifting our analytic focus from the removal of military
capabilities to authority collapse]{.underline} when discussing
strategic withdrawals' likely consequences might at first appear to be
nothing more than a minor semantic move. On closer inspection, however,
it [has far-reaching consequences for how to think about the connection
between retrenchment and possible rival gains]{.underline}. Most
importantly, [it reveals that the [withdrawal]{.mark} [of military
force]{.mark} from a particular space [alone]{.mark} [is neither
necessary nor sufficient to invite]{.mark} [rival]{.mark}
[expansion]{.mark}: it is possible that a great power maintains
authority over spaces outside of its homeland even without a direct
military presence within them, and it is similarly possible that it
loses authority over spaces abroad despite a continued military
presence]{.underline}. As I now turn to show, [[unduly focusing
on]{.mark} the removal of [military power]{.mark} per se [rather
than]{.mark} the collapse of [authority]{.mark} [has thus]{.mark} led
pundits and policymakers [to]{.mark} reach [distorted
assessments]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [retrenchment's
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why many strategic withdrawals do not pave
the way for rival gains All types of retrenchment my framework outlines
entail at least a partial reduction in a great power's military presence
on the ground. Hence, pundits and policymakers have concluded,
retrenchment regularly invites rival expansion. This thinking, however,
is too simplistic. As noted above, windows of opportunities rivals might
exploit emerge when a great power's disengagement causes its authority
to collapse. In this section, I argue that [there are strong reasons to
believe that [great powers engaging in]{.mark} three out of the four
forms of strategic [withdrawal]{.mark} my conceptual framework
identifies -- cutting back, delegating, and downsizing -- [will]{.mark}
often be able to [retain]{.mark} their [authority]{.mark} over the
respective area]{.underline}. [[Consequently]{.mark}, [no opportunities
for rival expansion emerge]{.mark} that would pose a threat to the
retrenching great power's security]{.underline}. In other words, these
forms of retrenchment do not carry the costs strategic withdrawals are
frequently alleged to entail. [Let us, [first]{.mark}, consider [cutting
back]{.mark}, i.e. retrenchment which takes the form of a great power
engaging in a partial military withdrawal from an area outside of its
homeland]{.underline}. When cutting back, [[the]{.mark} retrenching
[great]{.mark} [power]{.mark} continues to [retain]{.mark} at least a
token [force]{.mark} -- and often more than that]{.underline} -- in the
area, [which helps maintain order on the ground and deters outside
challenges to its rule, at a minimum, by functioning as a
tripwire]{.underline}.Footnote41 [In addition, it [continues to
bolster]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} through non-military means such
as the provision of economic aid or diplomatic assurances]{.underline},
[which it might even increase in order to assuage any domestic
opposition]{.underline} against the partial troop withdrawal [and signal
to other parties that it remains committed to the defence of the
area]{.underline}. In principle, great powers should thus be able to
retain their authority when engaging in this type of retrenchment. Given
the limited scope and depth of disengagement cutting back entails, the
risks associated with it are relatively small. Admittedly, it remains a
theoretical possibility that a limited troop withdrawal will set off a
cascade of events through which the great power's authority becomes
significantly weakened.Footnote42 For example, domestic as well as
international observers could perceive it as the prelude to a more
thorough disengagement, conclude that the great power's commitment to
the area is wavering, and thus feel incentivised to challenge its
position of predominance. Yet [the [likelihood]{.mark} [for]{.mark} such
[cascades]{.mark} to occur [appears slim]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[as]{.mark} [the threat of]{.mark} great power [war continues to
loom]{.mark} in the background]{.underline}, [and local actors remain
aware of the great power's continued ability to militarily fend of
challenges to its rule if necessary]{.underline}. Most of the time,
cutting back should thus be possible without worrying about creating
opportunities for rivals to expand their influence abroad. [Second,
[even]{.mark} a [complete]{.mark} troop [withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- such as occurs when delegating -- [[need not precipitate]{.mark} the
[collapse]{.mark} of a great power's authority]{.underline}. As
explained above, [when a great power decides to retrench by delegating,
it essentially attempts to switch from a political arrangement in which
boots on the ground are a key foundation of its control over the area to
one of indirect rule,]{.underline} i.e. in which it continues to
exercise predominant influence in the respective space but does so
remotely, usually by recruiting local political authorities as its
proxies. [The underlying logic of delegation]{.underline} -- and what
makes it so appealing for great powers in the first place [-- is that it
allows them to retain predominant influence while dramatically reducing
the costs of doing so by eliminating the direct military presence on the
ground]{.underline}. The goal is not to rescind one's authority, but to
exercise it through an alternative, less costly arrangement. Put
differently, pursuing delegation is centrally motivated by the goal of
withdrawing military forces without precipitating the kind of authority
collapse rivals might be able to exploit. In principle, delegation of
course carries the risk that the switch to indirect rule fails. Hoping
to exercise the same degree of imperative control as before, the great
power might find that it overestimated its ability to rule from afar.
For instance, local political actors might turn out to be unreliable
either in terms of their will to behave in accordance with the great
power's dictates or in terms of their ability to maintain military
capabilities sufficient to deter outside intervention. Yet, as the
strategic actors that they are, great powers are well aware of this
possibility and will therefore only pursue delegation when they are
near-certain that it will succeed, i.e. they are confident in their
prospective proxy's reliability. What should thus occur more frequently
than great powers pursuing delegation and later finding that it failed
is great powers planning to pursue it, concluding that it is not viable,
and therefore never implementing it. Not coincidentally, there are few
examples in modern history in which great powers pursued delegation and
failed.Footnote43 As an illustrative example, consider US plans for a
full military disengagement from Western and Central Europe after the
conclusion of World War II. It is increasingly well documented that,
from the United States' entry into the war onwards, the leadership in
Washington hoped to avoid any prolonged military entanglement on the
continent.Footnote44 During the war, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that
'the United States will be only too glad to retire all its military
forces from Europe as soon as this is feasible', and throughout the two
following administrations US officials did not give up on the idea that
any direct military involvement on the continent should not be allowed
to become a perpetual one.Footnote45 Yet the United States never
actually implemented a full military withdrawal and -- instead of
pursuing retrenchment as delegation, as initially planned -- US troops
remained on the continent indefinitely after the conclusion of the war.
The key underlying reason for this was that the power differential
between the Soviet Union and the Western European states, despite the
profound aid they had received through the European Recovery Program and
other initiatives, remained too stark as Soviet capabilities soared.
From Washington's perspective, retrenching by delegating was simply not
feasible, and they therefore never engaged in this type of strategic
retrenchment.Footnote46 [[Finally,]{.mark} consider
[downsizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recall that when retrenching by
downsizing a great power initiates a partial military withdrawal and
simultaneously works to reduce its politico-economic involvement in an
area outside of its homeland. [The type of disengagement this form of
retrenchment entails is [encompassing in scope]{.mark}]{.underline} --
it targets both military and non-military foundations of influence --
[[but limited in degree]{.mark}, as the great power neither fully
withdraws its troop presence nor completely abolishes its economic and
diplomatic involvement]{.underline}. Whether this type of retrenchment
will pave the way for rival gains will vary from case to case: it
centrally depends on how large the retrenching great power's remaining
politico-military footprint is after the completion of the downsizing
process. Yet, [given that it [retains]{.mark} a [military
presence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} simultaneously [continues to
utilise]{.mark} other tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit
to a lesser extent) to bolster its relationship with local political
actors, [in many cases the retrenching great power's authority will
likely be somewhat weakened but not erode to the point that outside
actors would feel compelled to compete for control over the
area.]{.underline} [The retrenching great power's [remaining]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} [will]{.mark} help [deter]{.mark} outside
[aggression]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the economic and diplomatic
[support]{.mark} it continues to offer not only [signals]{.mark} its
[continued]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} in shaping the area's political
future but will help [bolster]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} and secure their continued allegiance]{.underline}. In
consequence, while the reductions downsizing entails might, in some
cases, indeed end up being so pronounced that they precipitate a
collapse of authority, there are good reasons to believe that there will
exist just as many cases in which great powers downsize without opening
windows of opportunity for their rivals to exploit. The consequences of
abandonment: Strategic disaster guaranteed? [[But]{.mark} what about the
fourth and most extreme type of retrenchment, i.e. [abandoning]{.mark}?
When a great power decides to abandon a certain part of the world, it
effectively [revokes]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark} over
it.]{.underline} Its military forces are fully withdrawn, it no longer
offers economic or security benefits to incentivise subordination from
local political actors, and thus effectively abolishes the hierarchical
relationship that served as the foundation of its influence. [Given the
all-encompassing scope and depth of this type of retrenchment, it is
essentially unavoidable that it [opens]{.mark} a [window of
opportunity]{.mark} [for other powers]{.mark} to compete for authority
over the respective space]{.underline}. As opposed to those cases in
which the other three types of retrenchment are concerned, prima facie
it therefore appears more plausible to argue that when a great power
retrenches by abandoning it is bound to incur significant costs.
[[Still]{.underline}]{.mark}, [one should be careful not to overestimate
the risks associated with abandonment either]{.underline}. [While the
collapse of the retrenching great power's authority will noticeably
reduce the costs for its rivals to try and claim control]{.underline}
over the space it leaves behind -- most importantly, they must no longer
fear a direct military confrontation with a peer competitor -- [[this
does not]{.mark} [necessarily]{.mark} entail that said costs will be
sufficiently low to [render]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}
[attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When faced]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark} of a great power seeking to claim control over them,
historically, [nation-states]{.mark} have [respond]{.mark}ed not by
appeasing or bandwagoning with the outside power but [by]{.mark}
[balancing]{.mark} against it]{.underline}.Footnote47 Because of these
local balancing dynamics, other great powers seeking to expand their
influence after the retrenching great power's departure are thus [[still
likely to confront a]{.mark} respectable [obstacle that could]{.mark}
prove formidable enough to [deter them]{.mark}]{.underline} from
realising whatever expansionist ambitions they might harbour.Footnote48
Perhaps even more importantly, one should be careful not to take the
above discussion to suggest that abandonment will necessarily represent
a strategic disaster for the retrenching great power. This piece is
primarily concerned with the costs of retrenchment and how they have
been consistently overestimated. Whether retrenchment in any given
instance leads to increases or decreases in a great power's security,
however, depends as much on the benefits it acquires by pursuing this
course of action. In other words, even if retrenchment by abandonment
does open a window of opportunity that is successfully exploited by
rivals which acquire important strategic assets, these costs --
significant as they may be -- might be outweighed by the benefits the
retrenching great power acquires. The latter can include, among others:
a lower likelihood of involving the great power's troops in active
combat; considerably less strain on the great power's economy, on whose
health its power crucially depends in the long run; the ability to
invest more resources to address domestic issues of concern; and freeing
resources to deal with more vital security threat in other regions of
the world.Footnote49 Indeed, being the strategic actors that they are,
we should not observe great powers abandoning certain areas of the globe
unless they are confident that the resultant benefits will ultimately
outweigh the costs they will incur by engaging in this form of
retrenchment.Footnote50

Stories of success: Great power retrenchment in action [Let me now turn
to [the historical record]{.mark} to gather empirical [support]{.mark}
for my argument [that]{.mark} most forms of
[retrenchment]{.mark}]{.underline} -- cutting back, delegating, and
downsizing -- [[do not]{.mark} regularly [create]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark} [for rivals]{.mark} to expand their influence at
significantly lower costs]{.underline}. To show that such cases of
successful retrenchment are more than just a theoretical possibility, I
provide three plausibility probes for my argument, each of which
concerns a different type of retrenchment. First, I investigate the
United States' retrenchment from Korea during the 1970s -- a case of
cutting back -- and show that the troop reductions Nixon implemented did
not undermine US authority over the southern peninsula. Second, I assess
the Soviet Union's retrenchment from Romania during the 1950s -- a case
of delegating -- and find that even though Moscow engaged in a complete
troop withdrawal, this did not undermine its authority. Finally, I take
a look at the United States' retrenchment from Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years -- a case of downsizing -- and show that
it weakened but ultimately did not erode Washington's position of
authority vis-à-vis the region. Before moving on, a brief note about my
empirical approach -- that is, utilising a small number of short case
studies as plausibility probes -- is in order. After all, as Harry
Eckstein notes, 'it is true that case studies have been little used in
political studies as plausibility probes', which 'is largely due to the
fact that the idea of any sort of plausibility probe is foreign to the
field'. The logic behind this approach is that 'after hypotheses are
formulated ... \[a\] stage of inquiry preliminary to testing sometimes
intervenes and ought to do so far more often than it actually does in
political study', namely, 'probing the "plausibility" of
candidate-theories'. Note that 'plausibility here means something more
than a belief in potential validity plan and simple', yet 'also means
something less than actual validity, for which rigorous testing is
required'. Essentially, plausibility probes allow scholars to develop 'a
reasoned, not merely intuitive, "feel" for the odds \[for or\] against a
theory', help 'establish that a theoretical construct is worth
considering', and serve as 'suggestive tests ... before more rigorous
tests are conducted'.Footnote51 Given that the present work's focus lies
on proposing a new theoretical intervention to cast doubt on a widely
held conventional wisdom, it falls beyond its scope to also develop,
conduct, and analyse the kind of extensive empirical tests necessary to
reach a final decree about the contending views' validity. At the same
time, if this piece were to provide no empirical evidence at all, its
central proposition would rightly be rejected as not worthy of serious
consideration. Presenting a number of plausibility probes thus
represents an appropriate 'middle way', and the success of recent IR
studies with similar epistemic aims in utilising this approach should
increase our confidence in its effectiveness.Footnote52 [Cutting back:
The [US retrenchment from Korea]{.mark}, 1970s]{.underline} [Facing the
need to drastically cut the US defence budget]{.underline}, which due to
the Vietnam War had risen to \$81 billion in 1969, [President Nixon
decided to retrench from Korea during the 1970s]{.underline}.Footnote53
Although initially hoping that it might be possible to engage in a full
military withdrawal, the United States quickly realised that this was
not feasible at the moment, even if existing treaty commitments were to
be maintained after the military departure. A key reason for this were
continued South Korean pleas that indigenous capabilities to withstand
an attack from the North were far from sufficient. Accordingly, [at this
time retrenchment from Korea remained decidedly limited in both kind and
degree.]{.underline} In the terminology of the framework developed here,
[it represented a case of cutting back]{.underline}. Nixon's focus lay
exclusively on reducing the US military footprint on the ground, leaving
other sources of influence not only intact but in fact bolstering them,
e.g. by offering additional security assurances and promises of
extensive aid. [Although the United States decided in the spring of 1970
to withdraw roughly 20,000 troops from Korea, it provided President
Park's government with a series of reassurances in]{.underline}
[return]{.underline}. These included 'a pledge not to withdraw any more
troops', a 'written guarantee that the United States would support South
Korea if the North attacked', as well as the promise of 'an additional
\$3 billion worth of military assistance between 1970 and
1975'.Footnote54 In addition, the United States far from eliminated its
military presence on the ground in Korea. To the contrary, its remaining
troop presence continued to play an integral part in its plan to
maintain influence over the southern peninsula. [Precisely [because the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintained]{.mark} a significant
military [presence]{.mark} even after cutting back
and]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in addition, [[increased]{.mark} its use of
non-military tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} to bolster its
relationship with the South Korean government and the latter's ability
to provide for its security, [[the]{.mark} United States'
[decision]{.mark} to cut back from Korea during this time [did not
undermine]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In consequence,
[other powers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and most importantly Soviet
leaders -- [[did not]{.mark} view Washington's [retrenchment as
opening]{.mark} an [opportunity]{.mark} for them to extend their
influence into the area]{.underline}. To the contrary, for observers in
Moscow and beyond, US retrenchment at this time did not bring about a
meaningful change in political conditions. In fact, they essentially
considered it a non-issue. [It was common knowledge that South Korea
continued to fall squarely under the hegemony of the United
States]{.underline}, in both the security and economic realms.Footnote55
In short, after Nixon's decision to cut back from Korea, there was never
any serious worry -- or, from the perspective of US rivals, hope -- that
this might precipitate the erosion of its position of dominance
vis-à-vis South Korea. [No opportunities for rival gains
emerged]{.underline}, as US authority remained soundly intact.

retrenching by delegating -- the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania in the 1950s -- strikingly demonstrates that this type of
retrenchment need not create opportunities for rival gains either.
Recall that, [following World War II, the Soviet Union centrally relied
on a massive troop presence on the ground to both assert its control
over Eastern Europe]{.underline} and prevent an extension of US
influence into the region. [By the mid-1950s, however, Khrushchev began
to 'seek a more stable and permanent basis of relations with its
satellites']{.underline}. Crucially, 'this did not mean willingly losing
control over them. Instead, it meant making certain readjustments in
order to retain a maximum degree of influence and control, given the
changing circumstances since Stalin's death.'Footnote56 On all counts,
[these efforts to retrench by delegating without seriously undermining
Moscow's position of predominance vis-à-vis Romania [proved
successful]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Despite]{.mark} engaging in a [full
military withdrawal]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} [Soviet]{.mark} [Union]{.mark}
was able to [retain]{.mark} [Romania]{.mark} as part of its sphere of
influence [and avoided]{.mark} leaving [a]{.mark} [window of
opportunity]{.mark} for the West to compete for predominance in this
part of the world]{.underline}. [US leaders concluded from the get-go
that the Soviet Union's complete military withdrawal from the area did
not seriously alter the political circumstances in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} It had done nothing to undermine the Soviet Union's
authority in the region: Romania still fell squarely within the Soviet
Union's sphere of influence. Accordingly, 'in Washington the withdrawal
decision was not thought to be an important Soviet move'. As several US
officials -- including the assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, the assistant secretary of state for policy planning, and the
special assistant for Soviet bloc political-military affairs at the time
-- recounted afterwards, 'the Soviet troop withdrawal was seen as a
minor action with no relevant impact'.Footnote57 The main reason for why
Western observers considered the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania to be geopolitically insignificant is that [it did nothing to
undermine Moscow's position of authority]{.underline}. In the Romanian
government, the Soviet Union had identified a sufficiently reliable
proxy that would willingly comply with its demands. Thanks to its
geographic proximity, it further retained the ability to project power
into Romania even without a direct military presence and could thus
ensure the stability of its influence. Consequently, no window of
opportunity emerged that would have invited competition for control over
the area. Even before the Soviet Union withdrew its troops, Western
intelligence analyses explained along these lines that a 'Soviet
withdrawal alone would be less important than a settlement which allowed
the satellites to pursue at least a neutral policy'.Footnote58 Put
differently, even a complete military withdrawal would be meaningless
since it would do little to undermine the Soviet Union's ability to
control political developments on the ground. Tellingly, the majority of
Romanians themselves shared this assessment, 'perceiv\[ing\] the
development as one of only limited significance'. Diplomatic reports
from Bucharest spoke of the population's 'cynicism', 'skepticism', and
'apathy', indicating that few expected the Russian troop withdrawal to
meaningfully alter political realities on the ground.Footnote59 In
short, all observers -- whether in the Soviet Union, the United States,
or Romania itself -- concurred that the Soviet retrenchment from Romania
did not meaningfully alter the political landscape in Eastern Europe:
Soviet authority over Romania remained intact, and no opportunity
emerged for the West to expand its influence into the region.
[Downsizing: The [US retrenchment from Western]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark},
1990s]{.underline} Finally, let us turn to a case of downsizing, namely,
US efforts to reduce their commitments to Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years. As previously noted, [following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington sought to notably reduce its
politico-military footprint on the continent by engaging in significant
troop reductions and supporting the continent's move towards greater
political autonomy]{.underline}.Footnote60 As Geir Lundestad explains,
several reasons caused the George H. W. Bush administration to embark on
this course. For instance, 'the liberation of Eastern Europe had to be
buttressed financially and commercially and, with Reagan having run up
huge budget and trade deficits, Washington now left much of the
initiative for economic dealings with Eastern Europe to the EC
\[European Community\]'. Even more importantly, further integration of
reunited Germany 'was seen as essential for continued stability'.
Finally, the 'EC was also valuable in the perspective of the American
desire for burden-sharing ... If Washington was to do less in Europe and
more in other parts of the world, the European capitals had to do more
in Europe.'Footnote61 To a notable degree, the decision to grant Europe
greater politico-economic autonomy in the immediate post--Cold War years
paved the way for the emergence of Europe as a political power. As
Moravcsik summarises, by 2010 European integration had 'enjoyed an
astonishingly successful run'. Among other achievements, 'it completed
the single market; established a single currency; created a zone without
internal frontiers ("Schengen"); \[and\] launched common defense,
foreign, and internal security policies'. Consequently, the European
Union emerged 'as a major global force' to be reckoned with.Footnote62
In the words of David Lake, as a result of the increasing autonomy
Western Europe gained in both the economic and security realm,
'America's hierarchies in Europe were clearly waning' following the end
of the Cold War.Footnote63 However, although the United States' new
politico-economic role in Western Europe was thus notably limited
relative to the one it had played during the Cold War, [it would be
fundamentally mistaken to conclude that these developments caused US
authority over Western Europe to erode]{.underline}. While the United
States supported the idea of granting Western Europe an increasingly
independent economic and political role, this did not mean that it
sought to grant full foreign policy autonomy. To the contrary, 'in
Washington the assumption was still that the United States would act as
the undisputed leader, despite the relative rise of Western
Europe'.Footnote64 [Both militarily and economically, [Western Europe
continued to be dependent on]{.mark} close relationships with [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Although the number of US
troops stationed in Europe was cut significantly at the beginning of the
unipolar era, the US military presence in Western Europe remained one of
the largest in the world, exceeding 100,000 until well after the year
2000.Footnote65 US-led NATO continued to play an integral role in
Europe's security structure, and the security guarantee built into it
continues to represent one of the main reasons why Western European
nations appear to see little need to increase their own defence efforts
even today. [For well beyond the post-1990 decade, Washington has thus
been able to exert tremendous influence on the behaviour of Western
European states]{.underline}. Rather than allowing the order which had
served to facilitate cooperation in the West during the Cold War to
collapse, US leaders worked hard to not only maintain but expand it in
the years after 1990. Although the establishment of the 'new world
order', as President Bush came to call it, was centrally inspired by
ideological concerns and motivations, it also represented an
institutional arrangement which would serve to lock in US dominance
vis-à-vis Europe and beyond.Footnote66 This was no coincidence. To the
contrary, the United States consciously moved to maintain its hegemony
over Western Europe even after the fall of the Berlin Wall.Footnote67
Given the remarkable success of these efforts, US authority remained
resolutely intact as the world entered the era of unipolarity.
[Consequently, [no window of]{.mark} [opportunity]{.mark} ever
[materialised]{.mark} that would have allowed either one of the European
states or an outside power to seriously challenge US dominance on the
continent]{.underline}. The United States consciously and successfully
maintained its position of authority and thus Europe's continued pro-US
alignment. Conclusion [It would be an understatement to say that
[retrenchment]{.mark} ha[s]{.mark} a [bad
reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many pundits and policymakers today
believe that great powers which withdraw from commitments abroad
ultimately end up incurring significant costs. Specifically, they argue
that retrenchment opens windows of opportunity rivals can exploit to
expand their influence and acquire important strategic assets, thus
shifting the balance of power in their favour and increasing the
retrenching great power's vulnerability. In this piece, I have argued
that, [while intuitively appealing, these arguments [paint a distorted
picture]{.mark} of retrenchment's consequences, as they consistently
[overestimate]{.mark} its [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}: [they [fail to
appreciate]{.mark} that [retrenchment can take various forms]{.mark},
many of which do not regularly open windows of opportunity for rivals to
capitalise on.]{.underline} In short, the causal relationship
purportedly linking retrenchment to significant rival gains does not
operate as commonly postulated. These findings have important
implications for policymakers today. In particular, they speak to the
current debate surrounding US grand strategy and the question of whether
it would be wise for the United States to retrench from some of its
commitments abroad. This piece suggests that [[it is]{.mark} likely
[possible for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} engage in
some types of strategic [withdraw]{.mark}als [without]{.mark}
[allowing]{.mark} US [rivals]{.mark} such as China or Russia [to
acquire]{.mark} substantial geopolitical [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this vein, the three cases of successful retrenchment discussed in
this piece provide important insights into why and how the great powers
at the time were able to avoid eroding their authority while retrenching
and thus provide a series of valuable lessons for policymakers today.
Three stand out in particular. First, [whenever the troop reductions
implemented were only partial, this served the retrenching great power
well]{.underline}: whether in the case of its withdrawal from Korea
during the 1970s or from Western Europe in the 1990s, the fact that the
United States continued to retain some of its troops on the ground
helped ensure that its position of authority would persist. Said troops
not only served to remind the local populations of the United States'
special interest in -- and ability to shape -- political developments on
the ground, but more importantly deterred outside powers from
challenging US predominance. Second, as the case of the Soviet Union's
retrenchment from Romania shows, [as long as the retrenching great power
retains the ability to project preponderant military force into the area
it leaves, even a full military withdrawal is unlikely to cause the
erosion of its authority]{.underline}. [Local political actors will
realise that]{.underline} -- even in the absence of a direct troop
presence -- [the threat of force always looms in the background. Put
drastically: misbehave, and foreign troops might return]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[third parties]{.mark} that might consider competing for
authority after the troop withdrawal has concluded [will be aware of the
retrenched]{.mark} great [power's ability to come]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the area's [defence]{.mark} if needed]{.underline}. Finally, as
illustrated neatly by the Korean case, [increases in economic and
diplomatic concessions can go a long way towards compensating for troop
reductions]{.underline}. As much as Nixon's decision to reduce the
number of stationed US troops caused anxiety among the South Koreans as
to whether they would be able to rely on the United States going
forward, his decision to combine these cutbacks with new allocations of
aid, a commitment to not withdraw any more troops, as well as a promise
to come to South Korea's aid in the case of an attack from the North,
did much to alleviate said anxiety and thus bolstered the US position
post-retrenchment. Systematically investigating the success conditions
for the various forms of retrenchment beyond the three cases discussed
here represents one of several exciting avenues for future research
opened by the present piece. In addition, scholars might seek to
investigate whether theoretical and policy discussions would benefit
from an even finer-grained conceptual distinction regarding retrenchment
than the one advanced here. Overall, my hope is that, by providing a
novel conceptual framework distinguishing between various types of
international retrenchment, this piece will enable better causal
theorising and thus a more productive debate about the costs and
benefits of great power retrenchment. Only once our discussions of
retrenchment move past simplistic causal associations based on crude
conceptual foundations can we hope to generate solutions to the grand
strategic challenges confronting policymakers in the present moment.

China Can Side-step the Thucydides' Trap, The Chinese Journal of
International Politics, Volume 18, Issue 2, 2025, Pages 151--172,
https://doi.org/10.1093/cjip/poaf001

A balance of power reading of Thucydides suggests that [US\' efforts to
maintain its post-Cold War hegemonic position, either unilaterally or
through broader consent, are bound to fail]{.underline}. [The post-Cold
War "unipolar moment" was not a permanent fact but rather a temporary
artifact of the sudden and unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar
system]{.underline}.187 By virtue of its large population and high level
of economic growth, China was destined to replace the Soviet Union as
another pole in the 21st century international system. The interesting
question is not whether unipolarity will last but will it be replaced
with a bipolar or multipolar system?188 [One of the most important
causes of hegemonic wars in the wake of power transitions is the
security dilemma, the unintended dynamic in which the efforts one state
takes to ensure its security often undermine that of
others]{.underline}.189 While in an anarchical international system, the
security dilemma can never be completely eliminated, it can be mitigated
by the policies states adopt. Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian
War to the breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta
and he applauds Pericles' efforts to try to re-establish it through
restraint rather than replacing Spartan hegemony. [Not only is [a
balance of power]{.mark} grand [strategy]{.mark} [less likely to
exacerbate]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}, it is
eminently more feasible and will better serve American
interests.]{.underline}190 [A balance of power approach by the USA in
its rivalry with China will be effective because it builds upon a number
of well-established tendencies in international
politics]{.underline}.191 Most importantly, [[states]{.mark} tend to
[balance against threats]{.mark}, rather than band wagoning with
them]{.underline}.192 [As China grows more powerful and assertive,
states closest to it are feeling a greater sense of peril]{.underline}.
[Their response will be to seek ways to respond to that threat by
counterbalancing it. [A less]{.mark} [forward]{.mark} and assertive US
[posture will]{.mark} not only mitigate the security dilemma with China
but also [dampen]{.mark} common pathologies of balancing such as
[buck-passing]{.mark} by allies to the larger power and otherwise
under-providing for their own security]{.underline}. [The common problem
behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the propensity of
actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them against its
consequences]{.underline}.193 Some fret that recent Chinese investments
in anti-access/area denial ([[A2/AD]{.underline}]{.mark}) technologies
make it harder for the USA to continue to project power close to China.
However, these same [technologies [could]{.mark} also [bolster]{.mark}
America's beleaguered [allies]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.194
Taiwan, the most probable casus belli, is further from mainland China
than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about the same distance
that Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these relatively short
distances, neither was ever successfully invaded. [Today, [China will
have to project power across water]{.mark}, always [a]{.mark} [dicey
proposition]{.mark} but one made even harder now if US allies in the
region invest in their own A2/AD technologies to preserve the balance of
power.]{.underline} [Donald [Trump's]{.mark} return to the White House
raises the question of whether he [might be]{.mark} more
[amenable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [replacing]{.mark} America's long-standing
[Primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} approach to maintaining the status quo in
the Western Pacific with one premised upon a balance of power?195 [There
are]{.underline}, in fact, [grounds for thinking that Trump might
be]{.underline}. The latter approach would not seek to prevent any
change in the region, only those that threaten the global balance of
power. [During his first term in office, he [adopted]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
more "[transactional approach]{.mark} \[which\] often differed from his
team's competitive approach."]{.underline}196 [To be sure, the recently
re-elected former President has not shied away from economic
competition]{.underline} with China and has shown little compunction
about rattling the tariff saber and even threatening a trade war. [But
he seems "[ambivalent]{.mark}" [about]{.mark} embracing the American
China [hawks']{.mark} commitment to defend Taiwan against China if it
seeks independence]{.underline}.197 Hardly anyone would compare the
former and future President to the great Athenian leader Pericles, but
[it is entirely possible that Trump might at least embrace a Periclean
balance of power approach as a way out of the Thucydides'
Trap]{.underline}. Thucydides' fundamental lessons for the contemporary
USA in its rivalry with China is that democratic Athens erred when it
grasped for primacy by expanding its empire during the Peloponnesian
War; [today [America]{.mark} does not need to preserve a position of
primacy in East Asia but [can]{.mark} instead [rest content]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} maintaining a [balance of power]{.mark}
there]{.underline}. Indeed, [the tragedy of Thucydides' account is that
neither Athens nor Sparta appreciated the limits imposed upon their
striving for primacy by the balance of power]{.underline}.198 [The best
grand strategy for the contemporary USA]{.underline} I believe, and the
Thucydidean approach I know, [favors the more restrained balance of
power approach for the USA to manage its rivalry with China in this
century]{.underline} without blundering into the "Thucydides' trap."

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on **faith alone**]{.underline}.41 [There is **precious
little evidence** to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [[the world remained]{.mark} **equally
[peaceful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [[while the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cut]{.mark}
its [forces]{.mark} throughout the 1990s, [as well as]{.mark} while it
**[doubled]{.mark}** its military spending in the first decade of the
new century]{.underline}.42 **[Complex statistical
methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to [demonstrate that levels
of U.S. military [spending have been]{.mark} essentially [**unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hegemonic stability
theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple correlations to
support them, however. [The theory's supporters have **never been able
to explain adequately** how precisely **5 percent** of the world's
population could **force** peace on the other **95
percent**]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. [Most states are quite free to go to war
without U.S. involvement but **choose not to**]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially
after Iraq, to **steer well clear** of most civil wars and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of [Africa]{.mark} would be unlikely to
attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
**intervention**]{.underline}. [The continent [is]{.mark},
**nevertheless**, **more [peaceful]{.mark} today** than at **any other
time** in its history]{.underline}, [something for which U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony **[cannot take credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.43
[[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in]{.mark} **many such
[places]{.mark}** [to which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony **simply
[does not extend]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Overall, [proponents of the
**stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the
most **basic observations** from **cognitive psychology**]{.underline}:
[**rarely** are our actions as important to others' calculations as we
**perceive them to be**]{.underline}.44 [The]{.underline} so‐​called
**[egocentric bias]{.underline}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in
human interaction, [suggests that although it may be **natural** for
[U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as crucial in the
maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is. The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple
of factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [Americans have long been
**exceptional** in their **exceptionalism**]{.underline}.45 [The short
history of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can
easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story
of success, [has led to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it
is **morally, culturally**, and **politically superior** to other,
lesser countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional
state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the
world. [Americans have always combined that feeling of **divine
providence** with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the
world and **battle evil**]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that
sense of destiny, of being the object of history's call, that most
obviously separates the United States from other countries. Only an
American president would claim that by entering World War I, "America
had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the
world."46 Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no
other seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in
quite the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants
everybody to be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I
believe. And that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine
Albright called the United States the "indispensable nation," she was
reflecting a traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48
Exceptional nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to
assist the merely average. Many of the factors that contribute to
geopolitical fear --- Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested
interests, and neoconservatism --- also help explain American
exceptionalism and the indispensability fallacy. And unipolarity makes
hegemonic delusions possible. With the great power of the United States
comes a sense of great responsibility: to serve and protect humanity, to
drive history in positive directions. More than any other single factor,
the people of the United States tend to believe that they are
indispensable because they are powerful, and power tends to blind states
to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our international behavior and our
image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It brings with it the freedom to make
wide‐​ranging choices well beyond common sense."49 [It is quite likely
that the world **does not need the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to enforce peace]{.underline}**. In fact,
[if **virtually any** of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing
[explanations for]{.mark} the current [stability]{.mark} are correct,
the trends in international security may well [prove **difficult to
reverse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[No]{.mark}ne** of the **contributing
[factors]{.mark}** that are commonly [suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(**[economic development]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, complex
[**interdependence**, **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**,
international [**institutions**, **democracy**]{.mark}, **shifting
global [norms]{.mark}** on war]{.underline}) [seem **poised to
[disappear]{.mark}** any time soon]{.underline}.50 [[The world
will]{.mark} probably **[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline} its
[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}ful ways for the near future, at the very
least, [**no matter what** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

#### No offense\-\--heg isn't key to global stability. 

**Fettweis, 2017** (Christopher J. Fettweis 17. Associate professor of
political science, Tulane. "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace."
Security Studies, 26:3, 423-451, ADA-65)

These assessments of conflict are by necessity relative, because there
has not been a "high" level of conflict in any region outside the Middle
East during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment
that important caveat, some points become clear. The great powers of the
world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US intervention
has been high, but conflict levels low. US intervention is imperfectly
correlated with stability, however. Indeed, it is conceivable that the
relatively high level of [US interest and activity has made the security
situation in the Persian Gulf and broader Middle East
**worse**]{.underline}. In recent years, [substantial hard power
investments (Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq), moderate intervention (Libya),
and reliance on diplomacy (Syria) have been equally **ineffective** in
stabilizing states torn by conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible
that the region is essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work
would bring peace to its people, [it remains hard to make the case that
the US presence has improved matters]{.underline}. In this "strong
point," at least, [US hegemony has **failed to bring
peace**]{.underline}. In much of the rest of the world, the United
States has not been especially eager to enforce any particular rules.
[Even]{.underline} rather [incontrovertible evidence of genocide has not
been enough to inspire action]{.underline}. Washington's intervention
choices have at best been erratic; Libya and Kosovo brought about
action, but [much more blood flowed uninterrupted in Rwanda, Darfur,
Congo, Sri Lanka, and Syria]{.underline}. The US record of peacemaking
is not exactly a long uninterrupted string of successes.
[During]{.underline} the turn-of-the-century conventional [war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, a highlevel US delegation]{.underline} containing
former and future National Security Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan
Rice) [made a half-dozen trips to the region, but was unable to prevent
either the outbreak or recurrence of the conflict]{.underline}. Lake and
his team shuttled back and forth between the capitals with some
frequency, and President Clinton made repeated phone calls to the
leaders of the respective countries, offering to hold peace talks in the
United States, all to no avail.67 The war ended in late 2000 when
Ethiopia essentially won, and it controls the disputed territory to this
day. The Horn of Africa is hardly the only region where states are free
to fight one another today without fear of serious US involvement. Since
they are choosing not to do so with increasing frequency, something else
is probably affecting their calculations. Stability exists even in those
places where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is minimal.
Hegemonic stability can only take credit for influencing those decisions
that would have ended in war without the presence, whether physical or
psychological, of the United States. It seems hard to make the case that
the relative peace that has descended on so many regions is primarily
due to the kind of heavy hand of the neoconservative leviathan, or its
lighter, more liberal cousin. Something else appears to be at work.
Conflict and US Military Spending How does one measure polarity? Power
is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and
economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted
formula exists. Perhaps overall military spending might be thought of as
a proxy for hard power capabilities; perhaps too the amount of money the
United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of
the unipole. When compared to conflict levels, however, there is no
obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative relationship
between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic stability theorists
would expect to see. [During the]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cut back on
defense by about 25 percent]{.underline}, spending \$100 billion less in
real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 [To those believers in the
neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible
"peace dividend" endangered both national and global
security]{.underline}. "No serious analyst of American military
capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to
meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace," argued
Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 The world grew dramatically more
peaceful while the United States cut its forces, however, and stayed
just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. [The incidence and magnitude of global conflict **declined
while the military budget was cut**]{.underline} under President
Clinton, in other words, and kept declining (though more slowly, since
levels were already low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up.
[Overall US military spending has varied during the period of the New
Peace from a low in constant dollars of less than \$400 billion to a
high of more than \$700 billion, but war does not seem to have
noticed]{.underline}. [The same nonrelationship exists between other
potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict: there does not
seem to be much connection between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP,
**alliance commitments**, and forward **military
presence**]{.underline}. [There was very little fighting in Europe when
there were 300,000 US troops stationed there]{.underline}, for example,
[and that **has not changed** as the number of Americans **dwindled by
90 percent**]{.underline}. Overall, [there **does not** seem to be much
correlation between US actions and systemic stability]{.underline}.
[Nothing the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[actually does seems to matter to the New Peace]{.underline}. It is
possible that absolute military spending might not be as important to
explain the phenomenon as relative. Although Washington cut back on
spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered. The
United States has accounted for between 35 and 41 percent of global
military spending every year since the collapse of the Soviet Union.70
The perception of relative US power might be the decisive factor in
decisions made in other capitals. One cannot rule out the possibility
that it is the perception of US power---and its willingness to use
it---that keeps the peace. In other words, perhaps it is the grand
strategy of the United States, rather than its absolute capability, that
is decisive in maintaining stability. It is that to which we now turn.
Conflict and US Grand Strategy The perception of US power, and the
strength of its hegemony, is to some degree a function of grand
strategy. If indeed US strategic choices are responsible for the New
Peace, then variation in those choices ought to have consequences for
the level of international conflict. A restrained United States is much
less likely to play the role of sheriff than one following a more
activist approach. Were the unipole to follow such a path,
hegemonic-stability theorists warn, disaster would follow. Former
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski spoke for many when he
warned that "outright chaos" could be expected to follow a loss of
hegemony, including a string of quite specific issues, including new or
renewed attempts to build regional empires (by China, Turkey, Russia,
and Brazil) and the collapse of the US relationship with Mexico, as
emboldened nationalists south of the border reassert 150-year-old
territorial claims. Overall, without US dominance, today's relatively
peaceful world would turn "violent and bloodthirsty." 71 Niall Ferguson
foresees a post-hegemonic "Dark Age" in which "plunderers and pirates"
target the big coastal cities like New York and Rotterdam, terrorists
attack cruise liners and aircraft carriers alike, and the "wretchedly
poor citizens" of Latin America are unable to resist the Protestantism
brought to them by US evangelicals. Following the multiple (regional,
fortunately) nuclear wars and plagues, the few remaining airlines would
be forced to suspend service to all but the very richest cities.72 These
are somewhat extreme versions of a central assumption of all
hegemonic-stability theorists: a restrained United States would be
accompanied by utter disaster. The "present danger" of which Kristol,
Kagan, and their fellow travelers warn is that the United States "will
shrink its responsibilities and---in a fit of absentmindedness, or
parsimony, or indifference--- allow the international order that it
created and sustains to collapse." 73 Liberals fear restraint as well,
and also warn that a militarized version of primacy would be
counterproductive in the long run. Although they believe that the
rule-based order established by United States is more durable than the
relatively fragile order discussed by the neoconservatives, liberals
argue that Washington can undermine its creation over time through
thoughtless unilateral actions that violate those rules. Many predicted
that the invasion of Iraq and its general contempt for international
institutions and law would call the [legitimacy]{.underline} of the
order into question. G. John Ikenberry worried that Bush's "geostrategic
wrecking ball" would lead to a more hostile, divided, and dangerous
world.74 Thus while all hegemonicstability theorists expect a rise of
chaos during a restrained presidency, liberals also have grave concerns
regarding primacy. Overall, if either version is correct and global
stability is provided by US hegemony, then maintaining that stability
through a grand strategy based on either primacy (to neoconservatives)
or "deep engagement" (to liberals) is clearly a wise choice.75 If,
however, US actions are only tangentially related to the outbreak of the
New Peace, or if any of the other proposed explanations are decisive,
then [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can
retrench without fear of negative consequences]{.underline}. The grand
strategy of the United States is therefore crucial to beliefs in
hegemonic stability. Although few observers would agree on the details,
most would probably acknowledge that post-Cold War grand strategies of
American presidents have differed in some important ways. The four
administrations are reasonable representations of the four ideal types
outlined by Barry R. Posen and Andrew L. Ross in 1996.76 Under George H.
W. Bush, the United States followed the path of "selective engagement,"
which is sometimes referred to as "balance-of-power realism"; Bill
Clinton's grand strategy looks a great deal like what Posen and Ross
call "cooperative security," and others call "liberal internationalism";
George W. Bush, especially in his first term, forged a strategy that was
as close to "primacy" as any president is likely to get; and Barack
Obama, despite some early flirtation with liberalism, has followed a
restrained realist path, which Posen and Ross label "neo-isolationism"
but its proponents refer to as "strategic restraint." 77 In no case did
the various anticipated disorders materialize. As Table 2 demonstrates,
armed conflict levels fell steadily, irrespective of the grand strategic
path Washington chose. [Neither the primacy of]{.underline} George W.
[Bush nor]{.underline} the [restraint of]{.underline} Barack [Obama had
much effect on the level of global violence]{.underline}. Despite
continued warnings (and the high-profile mess in Syria), [the world has
not experienced an increase in violence while the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [chose
uninvolvement]{.underline}. [If the grand strategy of the United States
is responsible for the New Peace, it is leaving no trace in the
evidence]{.underline}. Perhaps we should not expect a correlation to
show up in this kind of analysis. While US behavior might have varied in
the margins during this period, nether its relative advantage over its
nearest rivals nor its commitments waivered in any important way.
However, it is surely worth noting that if trends opposite to those
discussed in the previous two sections had unfolded, if other states had
reacted differently to fluctuations in either US military spending or
grand strategy, then surely hegemonic stability theorists would argue
that their expectations had been fulfilled. Many liberals were on the
lookout for chaos while George W. Bush was in the White House, just as
neoconservatives have been quick to identify apparent worldwide
catastrophe under President Obama.78 If increases in violence would have
been evidence for the wisdom of hegemonic strategies, then logical
consistency demands that the lack thereof should at least pose a problem
As it stands, the only evidence we have regarding the relationship
between US power and international stability suggests that the two are
unrelated. The rest of the world appears quite capable and willing to
operate effectively without the presence of a global policeman. Those
who think otherwise have precious little empirical support upon which to
build their case. Hegemonic stability is a belief, in other words,
rather than an established fact, and as such deserves a different kind
of examination. The Political Psychology of Unipolarity
[Ev]{.underline}idence [supporting the notion that US power
is]{.underline} primarily [responsible for the New Peace is **slim**,
but]{.underline} belief in the connection [is quite strong]{.underline},
especially in policy circles. The best arena to examine the proposition
is therefore not the world of measurable rationality, but rather that of
the human mind. Political psychology can shed more light on unipolarity
than can any collection of data or evidence. Just because an outcome is
primarily psychological does not mean that it is less real; perception
quickly becomes reality for both the unipolar state and those in the
periphery. If all actors believe that the United States provides
security and stability for the system, then behavior can be affected.
Beliefs have deep explanatory power in international politics whether
they have a firm foundation in empirical reality or not. Like all
beliefs, [faith in the stability provided by hegemony is rarely
subjected to much analysis]{.underline}. In their simplest form, beliefs
are ideas that have become internalized and accepted as true, often
without much further analysis Although they almost always have some
basis in reality, [beliefs need not pass rigorous tests to prove that
they match it]{.underline}. [No amount of ev]{.underline}idence [has
been able to convince some people that vaccines do not cause autism, for
example, or that the world is more peaceful than at any time before, or
that the climate is changing due to human activity]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [as]{.underline} Robert [Jervis explains, "we often believe
as much in the face of evidence as because of it."]{.underline} When
leaders are motivated to act based on unjustified, inaccurate beliefs,
folly often follows. The person who decides to take a big risk because
of astrological advice in the morning\'s horoscope can benefit from
baseless superstition if the risk pays off. Probability and luck suggest
that successful policy choices can sometimes flow from incorrect
beliefs. Far more often, however, poor intellectual foundations lead to
suboptimal or even disastrous outcomes. It is worthwhile to analyze the
foundations of even our most deeply held beliefs to determine which ones
are good candidates to inspire poor policy choices in those who hold
them. People are wonderful rationalizers. There is much to be said for
being the strongest country in the world; their status provides
Americans both security and psychological rewards, as well as strong
incentives to construct a rationale for preserving the unipolar moment
that goes beyond mere selfishness. [Since people enjoy being "number
one," they are susceptible to perceiving reality in ways that brings the
data in line with their desires]{.underline}. [It is no coincidence that
most hegemonic stability theorists are American]{.underline}. Of the few
hegemonic-stability theorists from elsewhere, most hail from the United
Kingdom and counsel the United States to follow the lead of the British
Empire. Perhaps [the satisfaction that comes with being the unipolar
power has inspired Americans to misperceive the positive role that their
status plays in the world]{.underline}. Three findings from political
psychology can shed light on perceptions of hegemonic stability. They
are mutually supportive, and, when taken together, suggest that it is
likely that [US policymakers overestimate the extent to which their
actions are responsible for the choices of others]{.underline}. [The
belief in the major US contribution to world peace is probably
unjustified]{.underline}. The Illusion of Control [Could 5 percent of
the world's population hope to enforce rules upon the rest?]{.underline}
[Would even an internationally hegemonic]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [be capable of producing the
New Peace?]{.underline} Perhaps, but it also may be true that [believers
in hegemonic stability may be affected by the very common tendency of
people to overestimate their ability to control events]{.underline}. A
variety of evidence has accumulated over the past forty years to support
Ellen J. Langer's original observations about [the "illusion of control"
that routinely distorts perception]{.underline}.82 [Even in situations
where outcomes are clearly generated by pure chance, people tend to
believe that they can exert control over events.]{.underline}83 There is
little reason to believe that leaders are somehow less susceptible to
such illusions than subjects in controlled experiments. The extensive
research on the illusion of control has revealed two further findings
that suggest [US illusions might be even stronger than
average]{.underline}. First, [misperceptions of control appear to be
correlated with power]{.underline}: individuals with higher
socioeconomic status, as well as those who are members of dominant
groups, are more likely to overestimate their ability to control
events.84 [Powerful people tend to be far more confident than
others]{.underline}, often overly so, and [that confidence leads them to
inflate their own importance]{.underline}.85 Leaders of superpowers are
thus particularly vulnerable to distorted perceptions regarding their
ability to affect the course of events. US observers had a greater
structural predisposition than others, for example, to believe that they
would have been able to control events in the Persian Gulf following an
injection of creative instability in 2003. The skepticism of less
powerful allies was easily discounted. Second, there is reason to
believe that culture matters as well as power. People from societies
that value individualism are more likely to harbor illusions of control
than those from collectivist societies, where assumptions of group
agency are more common. When compared to people from other parts of the
world, Westerners tend to view the world as "highly subject to personal
control," in the words of Richard Nisbett.86 North Americans appear
particularly vulnerable in this regard.87 Those who come from relatively
powerful countries with individualistic societies are therefore at high
risk for misperceiving their ability to influence events. For the United
States, the illusion of control extends beyond the water's edge. An
oft-discussed public good supposedly conferred by US hegemony is order
in those parts of the world uncontrolled by sovereign states, or the
"global commons." 88 One such common area is the sea, where the United
States maintains the only true blue-water navy in the world. That the
United States has brought this peace to the high seas is a central
belief of hegemonic-stability theorists, one rarely examined in any
serious way. Indeed the maritime environment has been unusually peaceful
for decades; the biggest naval battles since Okinawa took place during
the Falklands conflict in 1982, and they were fairly minor.89 If
hegemony is the key variable explaining stability at sea, maritime
security would have to be far more chaotic without the US Navy. It is
equally if not more plausible to suggest, however, that [the reason
other states are not building blue-water navies is not because
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [dissuades
them from doing so but rather because none feels that trade is
imperiled]{.underline}.90 In earlier times, and certainly during the age
of mercantilism, zero-sum economics inspired efforts to cut off the
trade of opponents on occasion, making control the sea extremely
important. [Today the free flow of goods is vital to all economies, and
it would be in the interest of no state to interrupt it]{.underline}.91
Free [trade at sea may no longer need protection]{.underline}, in other
words, [because it essentially has no enemies; the **sheriff may be
patrolling a crime-free neighborhood**]{.underline}. [The threat from
the few remaining pirates hardly requires a robust naval presence, and
is certainly not what hegemonic-stability advocates mean when they
compare the role played by the US Navy in 2016 to that of the Royal Navy
in 1816]{.underline}. It is at least possible that shared interest in
open, free commons keeps the peace at sea rather than the United States.
Oceans unpatrolled by the US Navy may be about as stable as they are
with the presence of its carriers. The degree to which 273 active-duty
ships exert control over vast common parts is not at all clear. [People
overestimate the degree to which they control events in their
lives]{.underline}. Furthermore, if these observations from political
psychology are right about the factors that influence the growth of
illusions of power, then [US leaders and analysts are particularly
susceptible to misperception]{.underline}. They may well be
[overestimating the degree to which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can affect the behavior of others]{.underline}.
[The rest of the world may be able to **get along just fine**, on land
and at sea, without US attempts to control it]{.underline}.

Military Competition Heightens Security Dilemmas [The most acute and
high-profile dimension of the China challenge is the PLA's rise as a
military power of the first rank. The most tangible danger comes from
policies that encourage China to grow or use that power]{.underline}.
[Over roughly the past two decades, Chinese industrial policy has
evolved from an emphasis on economic development to national security
and autonomy]{.underline}.75 In parallel, [the PLA has been increasing
its military capabilities and shaping its force structure in a manner
that garners alarmist headlines from Western media and
pundits]{.underline}. [The two most important changes in China's
military are its navy and its nuclear arsenal---both have expanded to
degrees that are undeniable and highly complicating for Western military
analysts seeking military solutions to what are deeply political
problems.]{.underline}76 [The purpose of the PLA's naval expansion must
be understood in relation to U.S. military primacy. The operational
concept at the heart of PLA warfighting, what U.S. analysts call
"anti-access/area denial" ([A2/AD]{.mark}), [aims]{.mark} [to keep
the]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} military pinned down or [out of a
theater]{.mark} of combat while the PLA undertakes a mission against
some third territory]{.underline} in Asia.77 [[It is not]{.mark} a
military doctrine [capable of]{.mark} facilitating global
[conquest]{.mark} or even regional domination]{.underline}. [And it is
not designed to take over the United States or U.S. territory.
[Rather]{.mark}, A2/AD is a concept that [aims to counter]{.mark} the
advantages of U.S. [power projection]{.mark} in the event that U.S. and
Chinese forces clash in the latter's geographic
periphery.]{.underline}78 [China's nuclear expansion, meanwhile, has a
similar relational quality.]{.underline} [For a generation, [China
sustained]{.mark} a posture of nuclear "[minimum
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}"---a term of art referring to a strategy
of having just enough of a nuclear arsenal to be capa- ble of assured
nuclear retaliation in the event China is attacked with nuclear
weapons.79 In effect, China's nuclear weapons are primarily for
deterrence of nuclear attack. [Over the past decade, however, China has
rapidly accelerated its nuclear modernization.]{.underline} Since the
Trump years, China has constructed more than 200 missile siloes (we do
not know how many have warheads and how many are simply intended to
complicate U.S. targeting) and upward of 350 nuclear weapons as of 2023.
The Pentagon estimates that, at its current pace, the PLA could have
1,000 warheads by 2030.80 [It is also improving the lethality of its
arsenal]{.underline}, testing hypersonic missiles and a fractal orbital
bombardment system (FOBS)---a way of delivering warheads that defeats
early-warning radars and missile defenses.81 [At the nuclear level,
scholars judge that neither country has the desire to launch a first
strike, yet the nature of today's technologies and Sino-U.S. nuclear
postures have locked the two countries in a structural security
dilemma]{.underline}. Recent research shows that "[the shift in the
conventional balance of force in the region and the [U.S.]{.mark}
development of [low]{.mark}er-[yield]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [has led to]{.mark} greater [fears]{.mark} in China [of
U.S. limited]{.mark} nuclear [use]{.mark} in a conflict]{.underline}.
[Chinese strategists increasingly believe that U.S. nonnuclear strategic
capabilities threaten China's nuclear forces.]{.underline}"82 As the
U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed in 2023,
"Beijing worries that bilateral tension, U.S. nuclear modernization, and
the PLA's advancing conventional capabilities have increased the
likelihood of a U.S. \[nuclear\] first strike."83 [China is thus
expanding its [nuclear]{.mark} arsenal because it fears Washington might
launch nuclear strikes first]{.underline}. [The [modernization]{.mark}
of its nuclear program is a rational response to this
situation;]{.underline} [more, and more diverse, nuclear capabilities
are [necessary to ensure the PLA can retaliate]{.mark} with nuclear
weapons to U.S. nuclear first-use]{.underline}. [Expanding nuclear
capabilities from a position of inferiority, in other words, serves the
same prior goal of "minimum deterrence" but in a context where U.S.
nuclear modernization]{.underline} (priced at more than \$1.7 trillion
over thirty years and dating back to the Obama administration) [changes
the minimum capability required for deterrence]{.underline}. What makes
all this a security dilemma is that, like Chinese officials, most U.S.
policymakers have no desire to escalate to nuclear first use, and yet
the prospect of it remains all the same. To make sense of the risks of
nuclear and conventional war, we need to hold in our minds two truths at
once. [At a global, abstract level, the United States enjoys a favorable
balance of power---overwhelming military dominance relative to all other
powers. However, at a local, concrete level in Asia--- specifically
[across the]{.mark} Taiwan [Strait]{.mark}---[the b]{.mark}alance
[o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}ower [shifted]{.mark} in favor of the PLA over
[a]{.mark} [decade]{.mark} ago.]{.underline} [The correlation of forces
across the Taiwan Strait tilts against the United States [because
of]{.mark} [geography]{.mark}.]{.underline} Taiwan sits just off China's
coast but it is 5,200 miles away from Hawai'i and 6,600 miles away from
California. Moreover, [all of Taiwan is within range of China's
integrated air defense systems [(IADS]{.mark}),]{.underline} [meaning
there is no possibility of the United States achieving air superiority
in Taiwan without disabling China's IADS]{.underline}. [[And]{.mark}
given China's [large]{.mark} surface and undersea
[fleets]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there is no way to establish sea control
or sea denial off China's coast without attacking ports and critical
infrastructure on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. [[These must
be]{.mark} [design constraints on]{.mark} U.S. defense
[strategy]{.mark}, not opportunities for arms-racing]{.underline}.
[[Any]{.mark} traditional [warfighting scenario in Taiwan is a
loser]{.mark}, requiring a massive number of missile strikes against
targets on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. Despite obsessive
war-gaming, [the United States has never come up with a plausible
scenario in which it can launch repeated salvos against Chinese
territory without escalating to nuclear war]{.underline}. No matter what
weapons the United States buys or builds, it cannot dominate the Taiwan
Strait militarily the way it can elsewhere in the world. But it does not
necessarily need to. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been
living with]{.mark} an [unfavorable]{.mark} correlation of
[forces]{.mark} in Taiwan for some time [and]{.mark} the situation [has
been stable,]{.mark} because the calculation of the balance]{.underline}
(who has the upper hand in a nightmare scenario) [is a separate
analytical question from what a state does with its share of the balance
at any given point]{.underline}. [Xi Jinping has said a U.S.-led
campaign of "containment and suppression" of China has "brought
unprecedented, severe challenges," rallying Chinese citizens to "dare to
fight."]{.underline}84 [It is a clear expression of resolve---a
willingness to fight, even jingoism--- but not a willingness to launch a
preventive war]{.underline}. [[China is]{.mark}
inhibited---[deterred]{.mark}---from launching an invasion of Taiwan
because it would be costly in even the best case]{.underline}. [The
United States is similarly deterred from wish-casting for war in Taiwan
because that would be unwinnable]{.underline} in any conventional sense.
The situation is thus a security dilemma, which military policies can
escalate but cannot remedy. [Arguments that the United States needs to
proliferate weapons to allies, build more bases, or accumulate missiles
to fire from standoff range in order to "hold China at risk" are missing
the forest for the trees]{.underline}---you do those things either for
an unwinnable nuclear war, or you do them in the name of deterrence.
[But while the risks of such moves are obvious, the benefits of "more
deterrence" are not. Even without a U.S. military buildup, China has
remained deterred---despite it retaining a favorable balance of power
over Taiwan---for more than a decade.]{.underline} If deterrence holds
as a status quo, then America's foremost priority ought to be not
putting deterrence itself in jeopardy. Instead, [U.S. policy is [seeking
primacy]{.mark}---that is, to retain a favorable imbalance of power,
including in the Taiwan Strait, where that is not possible]{.underline}.
It is [positioning U.S. forces to encircle China]{.underline}---an
accusation that China had been making against the United States for more
than a decade but that, since the Trump years, has become a reality.
[And it is proliferating weapons to allies and partners throughout Asia,
[buoying]{.mark}---rather than arresting---the military
[modernization]{.mark} [trend]{.mark} across the region that
[heightens]{.mark} [mistrust]{.mark} [and]{.mark} confuses war
preparation with war prevention.]{.underline} [The United States may be
undertaking all of this with defensive motives]{.underline}---rational
U.S. officials do not seek open conflict---[but these moves are as bad
for deterrence as they are for democracy. Individually and collectively,
they [exacerbate]{.mark} [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}
[dynamics]{.mark} and encourage all the choices from China that the
United States claims not to want.]{.underline}

#### But even if they're right, revisionist states are [only]{.underline} dangerous when they've [just had their ambitions denied]{.underline}\-\--the plan creates the only scenario for great power war

Assessments, 10/24/18, "Danger: Falling Powers,"

There is, then, no disputing that [rising powers can have profoundly
disruptive effects. Yet such powers **might not**]{.underline} actually
[**be the most aggressive or risk-prone** type of revisionist
state]{.underline}. After all, [[if a country's position is]{.mark}
steadily [improving]{.mark} over time, [why risk]{.mark} messing it all
up through reckless policies that precipitate a premature
[showdown?]{.mark}]{.underline} Why not lay low until the geopolitical
balance has become still more favorable? [[Why not]{.mark} wait until
one has [surpass]{.mark}ed [the]{.mark} reigning [hegemon]{.mark}
altogether and other countries defer to one's wishes **[without a
shot]{.mark} being fired[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} So [while a rising
revisionist power may be tempted to assert itself, it
should]{.underline} also [have good reason to avoid going for
broke]{.underline}. Now [[imagine]{.mark} an alternative]{.underline}
scenario. [[A revisionist power]{.underline}]{.mark}---perhaps an
authoritarian power---[has been [gaining influence]{.mark} and
ratcheting its ambitions upward. [Its leaders]{.mark} have
[cultivated]{.mark} intense [nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
pillar of their domestic legitimacy; they have [promised the
populace]{.underline} that [past insults will be avenged and [sacrifices
will be rewarded with]{.mark}]{.underline} geopolitical greatness and
[**[global prestige]{.mark}**. Yet [then the country]{.mark}'s potential
[peaks]{.mark}]{.underline}, either because it has reached its natural
limit or because of some unforeseen development, [and the balance of
[power]{.mark} starts to [shift in unfavorable
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. It becomes clear to the country's leadership
that it may not be able to accomplish the goals it has set and fulfill
the promises it has made, and that the situation will only further
worsen with time. [[A **roll of the iron dice**]{.mark} now
[seems]{.mark} more attractive: It may be [the only chance]{.mark} the
nation has [to claim]{.mark} geopolitical [spoils]{.mark} before it is
too late]{.underline}. In this scenario, [[it is **not rising power**
that makes the revisionist]{.mark} state so [dangerous, but]{.mark} the
**[temptation to act before decline sets in]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this sense, the dynamic bears a resemblance to the famous Davies J-Curve
theory of revolution, wherein a populace is held to be more inclined to
revolt not when it is maximally oppressed but rather when raised
expectations are shown to be in vain. Obviously, [rational analysis does
not always prevail]{.underline} in world politics. Rising states can
become intoxicated with their own strength; they may simply get tired of
waiting to attain the status they desire; or some domestic pressure may
impel leaders to act dangerously. [But revisionists whose power has
begun to decline, or who have hit a rogue bump in the road,]{.underline}
**[may not feel that they even have the option of
waiting]{.underline}**.

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[Canada and Finland have [agreed to]{.mark} coordinate]{.underline}
their [development of new **[icebreaking]{.mark}** vessels]{.underline}

At the NATO Washington summit in July, [Canada, Finland and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [announced a collaboration on
development of new icebreaking ships.]{.underline} The Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort, a non-binding agreement colloquially known as [the
**[ICE Pact]{.mark}**, will [enable]{.mark} the three countries to
**[strengthen]{.mark}** their **[shipbuilding]{.mark}** industries
through information sharing, workforce development and procurement
alignment]{.underline}. Arctic concerns are growing in Washington, which
published an updated strategy for the region earlier this year.

What next

A joint memorandum of understanding that outlines a framework for
implementing the arrangement is expected to be signed before 2025, and
the Biden administration may push for this to happen ahead of next
month's US presidential election. The memorandum will also include a
mechanism for admitting other countries into the ICE Pact; Russian and
Chinese interest in the Arctic may encourage others to join.

Subsidiary Impacts

A bipartisan congressional group has asked the White House to prioritise
service to the Great Lakes region within the ICE Pact framework.

Quebec-based [[Davie]{.mark}, Canada's largest shipbuilder]{.underline},
has announced [[plans to open a shipyard in the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.

Last month, China sent its three vessels into the Arctic and announced
that it would fast track the construction of a fourth icebreaker.

Analysis

The [[ICE Pact sends]{.mark} an [**immediate signal** to
**industry**]{.mark} partners tha]{.underline}t Canada, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Finland [are committed to
purchasing more icebreakers. [**Shipbuilders** are **responding** by
**investing** in]{.mark} [**supply chains** and **shipyards**]{.mark} in
anticipation of these orders, positioning themselves to earn procurement
contracts when public funding for new projects is made

The arrangement reflects NATO's awareness of the Arctic's growing
importance, particularly as Russia and China seek to assert their
presence in the region with icebreaker fleets of their own. In the
medium-to-long term, [collaborative [**workforce development** and
**info**]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [sharing [will **shorten**]{.mark}

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [signed an
[ex]{.mark}]{.underline}ecutive [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder [on
Wednesday [aimed at **reviving** ]{.mark}U.S.
**[shipbuilding]{.mark}**]{.underline} and reducing China\'s grip on the
global shipping industry, [vowing to **[boost funding]{.mark}** for the
effort in **coming years**.]{.underline}

[**Republican** and **Democratic** U.S. [lawmakers]{.mark} for years
have [warned]{.mark} about [China\'s]{.mark} **growing
[dominance]{.mark}** on the seas [and]{.mark} **diminishing U.S. naval
[readiness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Senators Mark Kelly, a Democrat, and Todd Young, a Republican, welcomed
the executive order and said they would reintroduce their bipartisan
legislation to provide the congressional authorizations needed to
revitalize the industry.

The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative to move ahead with a
proposal that included levying million-dollar U.S. port docking fees on
any ship that is part of a fleet that includes Chinese-built or
Chinese-flagged vessels. Allies will be pushed to act similarly.

USTR\'s recommended port fees had sparked sharp criticism from
commodities exporters, trade groups and U.S. ship operators, who warned
of supply chain disruptions, job losses in port cities and inflation.
The order must be finalized by an April 17 deadline.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday said USTR should
have a final decision on remedies by middle of the month and repeated
his comments from Tuesday, saying that not all of the measures outlined
by the agency\'s original proposal would be implemented.

\"This could have been a miscommunication issue, some people thought
that all of those measures would be imposed,\" Greer said. But after
feedback and public comments, \"now we consider which of those measures
is most appropriate.\"

The order also requires USTR to consider proposing tariffs on
ship-to-shore cranes manufactured, assembled, or made using components
of Chinese origin, or manufactured anywhere in the world by a company
owned, controlled, or substantially influenced by a Chinese citizen, as
well as tariffs on other cargo handling equipment.

The executive order further requires the Department of Homeland Security
to enforce collection of Harbor Maintenance Fees and other charges, and
to prevent cargo carriers from circumventing those fees by routing goods
to ports in Mexico and Canada and then sending cargo into the United
States via land borders.

Asked about the U.S. order on Thursday, China\'s foreign ministry said
the idea that China was to blame for the U.S. losing its competitive
advantage in the shipping industry had no basis in fact.

\"The development of China\'s shipbuilding industry is the result of
technological innovation and active participation in market competition
by enterprises,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press
conference.

**[Trump]{.underline}**, [speaking in the Oval Office]{.underline},
[said [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would be spending \"a lot of
**money on** ]{.mark}**shipbuilding**\" [to **restore**
]{.mark}**American** [**capacity**]{.mark} in the
**sector**.]{.underline}

\"[We\'re **way, way, way behind**]{.underline},\" he told reporters.
\"[We used to build a ship a day, and]{.underline} [now we don\'t do a
ship a year]{.underline}, practically, and we have the capacity to do
it.\"

The order said recent data showed the United States built less than 1%
of commercial ships globally, while China built about half, an increase
from just 5% in 1999, according to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

[Trump\'s order called for creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to
provide reliable [funding for programs aimed at **shoring up U.S.
maritime capacity**]{.mark}, **including**]{.underline} consideration of
potential new or existing tariff revenue, fines, fees, or tax revenue.

It also calls for incentives to encourage private investment in
construction of commercial components, and improvements to shipyards,
repair facilities and dry docks.

#### ICE pact solves via [collaboration]{.underline} with allies.

**Heckmann '24** \[Laura; October 23; Senior Editor at the National
Defense Magazine; National Defense Magazine, "Trilateral Pact Aims To
Bolster Icebreaker Production,"
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2024/10/23/trilateral-pact-aims-to-bolster-icebreaker-production\]

[The recent announcement of a [collaborative agreement]{.mark} between
Finland, Canada and the United States]{.underline} [to build polar
icebreakers]{.underline} comes as China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and Russia is operating the largest fleet of
icebreakers in the world, including the only ones that are
nuclear-powered.

But the pact [is]{.underline} as much [about **[bolstering allied
shipbuilding industries]{.mark}** as it is about addressing global
threats]{.underline}, [and all [**three nations** have something to
**gain**]{.mark}, experts said.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or **[[ICE
Pact]{.underline}]{.mark}**, announced on the sidelines of NATO's 75th
anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., July 11, is a trilateral
agreement between the three nations to collaborate on the production of
polar icebreakers alongside allies and partners, labor and industry.

A statement from the White House announcing the agreement said the
collaboration i[s [intended to "strengthen]{.mark} the
**[shipbuilding]{.mark} industry** and **industrial capacity** of each
nation"]{.underline} and "build closer security and economic ties among
our countries through information exchange and mutual workforce
development focused on building polar icebreakers, as well as other
Arctic and polar capabilities."

The details of the agreement remain hazy, with a memorandum of
understanding promised "by the end of the year," but the statement said
the three governments intend to utilize shipyards in the United States,
Canada and Finland to "build polar icebreakers for their own use, as
well as to work closely with like-minded allies and partners to build
and export polar icebreakers for their needs at speed and affordable
cost."

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters the day of
the announcement that the pact is about "enhancing the collective
capacity of our three countries to build icebreakers at a time when we
are seeing an increasing need for those icebreakers from partners around
the world who want to operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions."

[This "increasing need" puts **[added pressure]{.mark}** [on a **U.S.
shipbuilding industry**]{.mark} that is already a **weak link** in the
**country's** **defense industrial base**]{.underline}, [[suffering from
**delayed programs**]{.mark}, [maintenance]{.mark} **backlogs** and
[**workforce** and supply chain **shortages**]{.mark}, according to
government watchdogs.]{.underline}

The U.S. Coast Guard has only two operational polar icebreakers: the
heavy Polar Star and the medium Healy. Polar Star was commissioned in
1976 and Healy in 2000. Both the fleet's size and age create maintenance
vulnerabilities that could cut the fleet in half if one is out of
commission.

The service has been working to expand its fleet through the Polar
Security Cutter program, which has been "plagued by delays" and more
than doubled in cost, according to a report by the Congressional Budget
Office released in August.

An October Congressional Research Service report noted that the Coast
Guard needs eight or nine polar icebreakers, and the first of the new
ships is not likely to enter service until 2029. That raises questions
about what the United States will be able to deliver under the pact when
it is struggling to meet its own demand.

A letter to the White House signed Oct. 2 by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security,
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said a
reliable icebreaker fleet is "critical" to achieving strategic
objectives in the Arctic.

[The letter also said that [strengthening]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
shipbuilding industry of each [ICE Pact]{.mark} country and generating
"**good jobs at shipyards** and related businesses all over" [is]{.mark}
[the **aim** of the **partnership**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- especially
for advancing polar icebreaker recapitalization in the United States
that is "far too slow."

[**[Finland]{.mark}** [and **Canada**]{.mark} [can help, bringing to the
**agreement** a **history** of icebreaker design and **shipbuilding
experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada has the second largest
icebreaker fleet in the world behind Russia. Meanwhile, 60 percent of
the world's icebreakers are produced at Finnish shipyards and 80 percent
are designed by Finnish companies, according to the Finnish government.

A Canadian government release said the country's "world-class expertise
in Arctic and polar capabilities" will be "foundational" to the
agreement's success.

### Shipbuilding Dead \-\-- 1NC 

#### Domestic shipbuilding is a [disgrace]{.underline}. Nothing can save it. 

**Lynch '25** \[David; March 23; MA in international relations at Yale
University, Financial writer covering trade and globalization; The
Washington Post, "Trump wants to build more ships in the United States.
It's not so simple."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/23/trump-shipbuilding-fees-china/\]

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [appears]{.underline} [set to
broaden his attack on global economic]{.underline} integration [by
imposing new multimillion-dollar fees on the **Chinese container
ships**]{.underline} that bring many foreign goods to U.S. shores.

The proposed fees are intended to counter what the administration
describes --- echoing its predecessor --- as unfair Chinese trade
practices that have given Beijing a chokehold on the construction of
commercial vessels.

Part of a broader White House strategy to revive U.S. shipbuilding, the
levies threaten the system of oceangoing trade that has developed over
the past quarter-century --- and could result in a repeat of the supply
chain disruptions the nation suffered during the pandemic.

By charging Chinese-owned or -built vessels each time they dock at a
U.S. port, the administration hopes to discourage ocean carriers from
buying more ships from China. [The U.S. government would spend some of
the tens of billions of dollars raised through the fees on subsidizing a
commercial **shipbuilding industry** that has fallen into
disrepair.]{.underline}

[Generous **government support**, including tax incentives, would enable
revitalized U.S. shipyards to fill orders that now go to facilities in
China]{.underline}, South Korea or Japan, according to the
administration. U.S. exporters also would be required to meet targets
for shipping their goods on U.S.-flagged vessels, rising from almost
nothing to 15 percent of the total in seven years.

But [**[maritime specialists]{.mark}** [call hopes for a]{.mark}
Lazarus-like [**revival** of U.S. **shipbuilding**]{.mark}
**[unrealistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [saying it would [require]{.mark}
**[decades]{.mark}** [of **consistent** **federal
support**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Imposing **hefty [fees]{.mark}** on
**Chinese** ships now, before American-made alternatives exist,
[would]{.mark} only [raise]{.mark} **freight [costs]{.mark}** and
**snarl global supply chains**]{.underline}, they said.

"It appears to be written by people who have absolutely no idea how the
maritime supply chain works," said Lars Jensen, chief executive of
Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy in Copenhagen. "The container lines
will adjust and cut out the smaller ports. The consequence is going to
be massive port congestion in the larger ports."

[The **shipbuilding initiative**]{.underline}, which includes the
creation of a new White House office, represents another element in
Trump's frontal assault on trade orthodoxy. Coupled with his plans for
the most extensive tariffs in nearly a century, it [would reorient
global commerce in an "America First" direction.]{.underline}

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has proposed a complex menu of
fees targeting Chinese ships, scheduled to be the subject of a public
hearing by his agency on Monday.

One levy applies to each port call by a Chinese ocean carrier; a second
would be assessed based on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in a
carrier's fleet; a third depends upon the percentage of the carrier's
future orders that have been placed with Chinese shipyards.

The measures are needed "to create leverage to obtain the elimination"
of Chinese maritime industry dominance, USTR says, suggesting the
president may be prepared to negotiate with Beijing.

If the new port fees are imposed, the three major ocean carrier
alliances, which collaborate like airline industry partnerships, would
probably try to avoid the extra costs by reassigning Chinese-made
container ships from U.S. routes to serve Europe, analysts said.

Some vessels that would be subject to the fees could dock at Canadian or
Mexican ports rather than unload at American wharves --- costing
American dockworkers and truck drivers.

[Smaller carriers]{.underline} [with long-term leases to operate
Chinese-made ships could face ruin,]{.underline} said Hans Laue,
president of Gisholt Shipping in Weston, Florida. Among those affected
would be regional U.S. carriers that ply the waters between South
Florida and gulf ports or Caribbean ports such as Jamaica, the Cayman
Islands and the Dominican Republic.

"[They have hundreds, if not **thousands**, of people working in the
U.S., and they would be **immediately wiped out**]{.underline}," he
said.

Some vessel operators already are trying to cancel contracts with some
U.S. ports and delaying negotiations on new agreements "due to the
uncertainty of costs associated with trading with the United States,"
Brett Bourgeois, executive director of the New Orleans Board of Trade,
said in written comments on the USTR proposal.

Such upheaval in shipping schedules would have consequences for large
and small ports. Container ships normally operate like waterborne buses,
making scheduled stops at multiple ports along a coastline.

But facing fees that might reach \$3.5 million for each stop, they would
probably choose to unload all of their cargo in just one place, such as
the Port of Los Angeles, executives said.

"[You are absolutely going to disrupt the U.S. economy. You'll create
covid-like congestion at places like L.A., Long Beach and New
York]{.underline}," said Joe Kramek, president of the World Shipping
Council, which represents the major ocean carriers.

Fewer vessels docking at smaller ports such as Oakland, California,
would make it harder and more expensive for major U.S. exporters to ship
their goods to foreign customers, and it would affect imports as well.
Farmers who rely on bulk carriers to move grain and other commodities
would be hit especially hard, forced to send their crops hundreds of
miles overland to Southern California.

The proposed fees "will have catastrophic effects on U.S. exports,"
Kevin LaGraize Jr., president of Southport Agencies in Metairie,
Louisiana, said in written comments submitted to USTR.

The fees are just one element in an eight-page draft executive order,
titled "Make Shipbuilding Great Again" and obtained by The Washington
Post, that the administration is finalizing.

U.S. shipyards in recent years typically delivered only a handful of
commercial vessels each year, while China built hundreds. The draft
executive order cites an "urgent need to reinvigorate the U.S.
shipbuilding and maritime industries" and proposes a comprehensive menu
of government aid, including the shipping fees and tariffs on Chinese
cargo-handling gear.

According to a Feb. 27 draft, the president would ask Congress to
establish a dedicated funding source for new shipbuilding ventures.

"We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much,
but we're going to make them very fast, very soon," Trump said in his
address on March 4 to a joint session of Congress.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the
executive order.

[The focus on shipbuilding has bipartisan support]{.underline} --- a
group of labor unions filed a petition seeking government help for
domestic shipmakers during the Biden administration.

In January, just days before President Joe Biden left office, his
administration's USTR endorsed the unions' complaint, concluding in a
182-page investigative report that the Chinese government had used
generous state financing, forced technology transfer, intellectual
property theft and discrimination against foreign firms to increase its
dominance of global maritime markets.

[China's share of global shipbuilding orders rose from less than 5
percent in 1999 to]{.underline} [more than 50 percent by
2023]{.underline}, [depriving U.S. shipyards of business and creating
dangerous "**vulnerabilities** across the U.S.
**economy**]{.underline}," the report said.

[China's **shipbuilding supremacy** also has **military
implications**]{.underline}. Even as relations with Beijing
deteriorated, the U.S. Navy continued to purchase tankers and dry cargo
carriers from Chinese shipyards, according to a 2023 Congressional
Research Service report.

In a speech Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance cited the nation's
shipbuilding decline as an example of deindustrialization that "poses
risks both to our national security and our workforce." Vance contrasted
the industry's performance during World War II, when shipyards turned
out "three ships every two days," with its current annual output of just
five ships.

"Revitalizing domestic shipbuilding is not only possible but also a
priority," said Michael Wessel, a Washington consultant with ties to the
United Steelworkers union. "The principal contributing factor to reduced
capacity has been China's nonmarket pricing of ships. Order books have
dried up. We have existing yards that can do more today, and we have
facilities that can be brought online."

[[An **industry revival**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[faces]{.mark}
**[numerous hurdles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. U[.S. [shipyards]{.mark}
today [have little]{.mark} **[presence]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[commercial market]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[concentrating]{.mark}
instead [on]{.mark} producing **vessels** for [the
**Navy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only significant recent contract won
by a U.S. shipyard came in 2022, when Matson, a Hawaii-based carrier,
ordered three midsize container ships from the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in
Philadelphia.

[Matson]{.underline}, which serves domestic routes, [needs the vessels
to comply with [the Jones Act]{.mark}, which requires that cargo moving
between **two American ports** is carried aboard a **U.S.-built
ship.**]{.underline}

[The protectionist law]{.underline}, dating to 1920, [[helps explain why
**U.S. shipyards** are]{.mark} so
**[uncompetitive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, analysts said. Matson paid
roughly \$330 million per ship, while Chinese shipyards offer similar
vessels for just \$60 million, according to Lloyd's List, a London-based
industry publication.

[**[Trump's]{.mark}** widespread [**imposition** of **import
taxes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including on materials used in
shipbuilding such as steel, [will]{.underline} only [[make the]{.mark}
domestic [industry]{.mark} [less competitive]{.mark} in **global
markets**,]{.underline} said Rob Willmington, a Lloyd's List analyst.

"China builds what the industry wants," he said. "You can go to them
with your own design, and they'll do it and do it for 20 percent less
than South Korea. [What's missing is the **market** for **U.S.
ships**."]{.underline}

### Shipbuilding Dead \-\-- 2NC

#### Shipbuilding is [shot.]{.underline} No amount of money can save it from backlogs, lack of expertise, labor shortages, costs.

**Grazier '25** \[Dan; April 2; senior fellow and program director at
the Stimson Center, former Marine Corps captain who served tours of duty
in Iraq and Afghanistan; Responsible Statecraft, "Why US shipbuilding is

https://responsiblestatecraft.org/us-navy/\]

"We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry,
including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding," President
Trump said during his March 6 joint address to Congress.

The president did not break new ground with the announcement. Virtually
every year, Navy and industry leaders complain that the United States
does not invest enough in the nation's shipbuilding facilities. Yet
[according to]{.underline} the [C]{.underline}ongressional
[B]{.underline}udget [O]{.underline}ffice, [lawmakers have appropriated
more shipbuilding funds than the president requested for at least 17 of
the past 20 years. [Even with]{.mark} the **[extra funds,]{.mark}** the
Navy's major [shipbuilding]{.mark} programs have consistently [fallen
**behind schedule**]{.mark} and over budget.]{.underline}

Over the next three years, the Navy plans on retiring 13 more ships than
it will commission, shrinking the fleet to 283 ships by 2027. [According
to the Navy's current plan, the fleet will grow to 515 crewed and
uncrewed vessels by 2054. [To reach]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [C]{.underline}ongressional
[B]{.underline}udget [O]{.underline}ffice [estimates the [Navy will
spend]{.mark} more than **[\$1 trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, nearly
\$36 billion each year for the next three decades on shipbuilding alone.

[It remains [**unclear** if]{.mark} the [Navy can]{.mark} realize its
plan, [even if Congress provides]{.mark} the [funds]{.mark}. Ramping up
naval [construction is **not**]{.mark} simply [a matter of
resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Navy spent \$2.3 billion between
2018 and 2023 to increase the capacity of the submarine shipyards.
Despite this investment, the production rate for Virginia-class attack
submarines decreased from around two boats per year to 1.2.

In just 10 years after the end of the Cold War, [the [number of
**skilled**]{.mark} shipyard [workers **shrank**]{.mark} from 62,000 to
21,000.]{.underline} The number of workers has increased since 2001, but
shortages remain. During a 2024 symposium, [the director of the Navy's
Submarine Industrial Base Program said the United States needs to hire
140,000 workers just to meet the needs of the current submarine building
program.]{.underline}

One of the best ways for the Navy to ease the current shipbuilding
struggles is to pursue better ship designs. [The constant pursuit of
exquisite technology and excessively **[complex]{.mark}** ship [designs
results in]{.mark} **[longer]{.mark}** construction [times]{.mark}. The
insidious practice of **[concurrency]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
beginning construction of a ship before the design is complete ---
[[causes]{.mark} further **[delays]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As **[[design
flaws]{.underline}]{.mark}** are discovered during construction, workers
must go back and re-do already completed work. These often [[require
**extensive**]{.mark} retrofitting, consuming substantial [time]{.mark}
and money.]{.underline} With limited shipbuilding facilities, [longer
construction times [create]{.mark} a **[backlog]{.mark}** that only
exacerbates industry's ability to meet demand.]{.underline}

Navy leaders could provide some relief to the haggard shipyards by
simplifying ship designs. Simplicity should always be a key design
parameter in any weapon program. Designs based on proven technology can
be developed and built faster. An acquisition strategy that prioritizes
simplicity will keep the Navy and other services one step ahead of
obsolescence.

Navy leaders should have learned this lesson from the Littoral Combat
Ship debacle. That program was intended to be the small surface
combatant of the future with a complicated modular design to swap out
specialized equipment for different missions. Engineers could not get
that gimmick to work properly, and the scheme was eventually abandoned.
The program has been beset by a string of embarrassing maintenance
failures and questions about its combat survivability. The Navy is now
in the process of retiring these troublesome ships. The Littoral Combat
Ship program's only milestone achievement is joining the mothball fleet
early.

[[Before **throwing**]{.mark} more [money]{.mark} at the shipbuilding

corvette that can be built by the nation's other shipyards. The Navy has
used a similar approach of licensing designs to commercial shipbuilders
in the past to meet its shipbuilding goals to great effect. The idea has
merit today because doing so would expand both the size of the fleet and
the industrial base.

The Navy's challenges didn't crop up overnight, and they won't be solved

Brain-drain Conundrum,"

[[Shipbuilding]{.underline}]{.mark} has been around for centuries, and
it [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} gone through its cycles of innovation and
improvement, but the basic tenants of shipbuilding [[stay
consistent.]{.underline}]{.mark} That is **[[until now. U.S.
Shipbuilding]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is facing]{.mark} a two-fold
**[attack]{.mark}**.]{.underline} An **[[ageing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and [[**retiring** workforce paired with]{.underline}]{.mark} an
ever-increasing [[demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark} technological
[innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once upon a time a shipbuilder could
work his entire career in one place and retire while knowing he could
have his own kids working in that same place for their entire career.
[[Coupled with]{.mark} the **[instability]{.mark}** of industry
workloads [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the ever-increased [[competition
for]{.mark} those workload [contracts, there has been]{.mark} an
**[attrition]{.mark}** to the industry.]{.underline} Some [[smaller
yards]{.underline}]{.mark} that were once stable places of employment
for community workforces [[have **gone under**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Either [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} competition and lack of work or
simply due to the lack of a replacement workforce with the knowledge to
continue competing in the industry. [[The **ever-present
brain-drain.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[This brain-drain is]{.underline}, simply put, [an [**Aging Workforce**
with **no replacement**]{.mark} system to depend on]{.underline}. For
example, the **[[average]{.underline}]{.mark}** age of maritime and
shipyard workers is around 41-55 years old. These [[workers]{.mark} [are
closer to **retirement**]{.mark} than the start of a
career.]{.underline} This is tied to the fact that most [[high
school]{.mark} aged [kids]{.mark} are [pressured to]{.mark} attend
**college** and **[not enter]{.mark}** the **[physical labor]{.mark}**
workforce has led to the difficulty of the modern shipyard to find
replacement workers. This also [leads them to]{.mark} face a **[hard
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, either adapting to the ever-changing
world or falling by the wayside. So, what can be done to mitigate the
brain-drain conundrum? Several factors must be realized first before you
can address the problem.

#### Alt causes. Steel prices, labor costs, shipyards, culture.

Progress, MS in Systems Engineering at University of Central Florida;
Noahpinion, "Why Can\'t the U.S. Build Ships?,"
https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships\]

This roughly brings us to the modern day. [The
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} continues to [[produce]{.underline}]{.mark}
an [insignificant [**fraction** of]{.mark} commercial
[ships]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the shipbuilding industry it does have
is propped up by some of the most restrictive protectionist laws in the
world. [American ship [**costs** and]{.mark} construction
**[times]{.mark}** are **[far higher]{.mark}** than those around the
world, and [markets]{.mark}]{.underline} that once provided a healthy
amount of work for shipbuilders (such as inland and coastal trade)
[have]{.underline} greatly [**[declined]{.mark}**. The [number]{.mark}
of active shipyards]{.underline} has **[[continued to
fall,]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the yards that do exist mostly do
either naval work or build vessels to support offshore oil drilling. The
cost and expense of building American ships, along with the
protectionist laws that prevent the use of foreign-built ships, have had
a variety of downstream effects, from creating barriers to offshore wind
farm construction to failing to insufficient dredging of our channels
and waterways.

Notably, these struggles haven't prevented the U.S. from being a major
shipbuilding innovator. Many of the most important advances in ship
technology, such as nuclear-powered ships, container ships, LNG
carriers, ore/bulk/oil carriers, and large-block construction were all
developed in the U.S. But in turning these innovations into competitive
industries, America has come up short.

Conclusion

What's behind the US's long history of being unable to compete
commercially? In looking at the history of US shipbuilding, two major
trends stand out. [The first is the **[high]{.mark}** cost of
**[inputs]{.mark}**, particularly **[labor]{.mark}** and
**[steel]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Shipbuilding is labor
**[[intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and we see a repeated pattern of
it moving to countries with low-cost labor: from Britain to Japan, then
to Korea, then to China. [[The U.S]{.underline}.,]{.mark} on the other
hand, [[has **never** been able to leverage low-cost
labor]{.mark}:]{.underline} as early as the early 19th century, U.S.
labor costs were higher than British costs, and remained so into the
1950s. And while it's theoretically possible to offset your high-cost
labor by being more productive, [[low]{.mark}-labor [cost
countries]{.mark} have historically been able to rapidly
[improve]{.mark} their [productivity, making this a **difficult race**
]{.mark}to win.]{.underline} Japan worked diligently to adopt and
improve the methods of large block construction and statistical process
control, and as Korea grew its shipbuilding industry, it went to
considerable efforts to import those technologies and best practices.

CHART OMITTED

We see something similar [[with steel.]{.mark}]{.underline} While the
U.S. competed successfully in the international market when ships were
made from wood (which was cheap in the U.S.), it began to struggle when
the technology shifted to iron and steel, which in the mid-19th century
could be made more cheaply in Britain. Similarly, in the 1970s Japanese
steel was cheaper than U.S. steel, and in the 1980s Korean steel was
significantly cheaper than U.S. steel. [The [high cost]{.mark} of U.S.
inputs is thus [a]{.mark} considerable [**barrier** to]{.mark}
successfully [competing]{.mark} in the shipbuilding market.]{.underline}

[[The other]{.mark} notable trend visible in American shipbuilding [is
**cultural**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The successful shipbuilding countries
often have a strong desire to make their shipbuilding industries
internationally competitive. In their book on the history of Japanese
shipbuilding, Chida and Davies note that following WWII Japan had a
"burning zeal" to make its shipyards competitive with the best in the
world, and diligently worked at improving its processes. Korea likewise
was strongly motivated to make its shipbuilding industry a successful
exporter. One British shipbuilder noted that "if a Japanese shipbuilder
said the price was 10, all you would need to do was take that to a
Korean shipbuilder and they would bid 9 without looking at the
specification or anything else." It's notable that successful
shipbuilding countries are often island countries or (like Korea)
effectively islands that are highly dependent on imports and exports.

[[The U.S.,]{.underline}]{.mark} on the other hand, [[never
appears]{.mark} to have been strongly [motivated]{.mark} to make its
shipbuilding industry an international success.]{.underline}
Historically it has been isolationist, trading much more with itself
than it has with other countries. Shipbuilding policies have long been
much more focused on sheltering the industry from competition rather
than driving to make it successful. [[Shipbuilding unions]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} often **[resisted]{.mark}** dramatic [changes]{.mark} in
shipping and shipbuilding technology.]{.underline} Best practice
transfer efforts often appear half-hearted. A Japanese shipbuilding
executive noted that if ships were behind schedule, American yards were
inclined to throw more labor at the problem, where Japanese yards would
ask for the reason behind the delays and resolve the fundamental issues.
A recurring theme in The Abandoned Ocean, a history of U.S. maritime
policy, is that the U.S. has never been able to marshall the political
will to remake its industry along more competitive lines.

**[[Naval forward presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [the practice of

**deter adversaries**]{.mark}, **reassure allies,**]{.underline} respond
to crises, [and perform]{.underline} constabulary [functions for the

supporters]{.underline} --- under the illusion that "credibility
anywhere is credibility everywhere" --- darkly [warn that rolling back
presence operations **will** **embolden America's
adversaries**.]{.underline}

[The opposite is true]{.underline}. [A **navy tasked to do all** these
things **[cannot]{.mark} do them all well.** Rolling back presence
**will [strengthen]{.mark}**, not **weaken**,
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For too long, short-term thinking
has taken priority over managing long-term risk. It's time to flip the
script. [Readiness for **great-power conflict**]{.underline} [--- peace
through strength rather than global policing --- should once again be
America's **primary grand-strategic aim**.]{.underline}

Too Busy, and Too Small

Few Americans appreciate just how busy their navy is. [At any time, over
one-third of U.S. [Navy]{.mark} ships are deployed --- the greatest
proportion in history]{.underline}. Sometimes these ships are training
with allies and partners, buttressing American power. Sometimes they are
responding to crises where legitimate American interests are at stake
and force may be necessary. But many of the Navy's overseas duties are
unrelated to coercion or deterrence, including humanitarian operations,
freedom of navigation transits, "maritime security" patrols in far-flung
regions, or various missions under the nebulous banner of norms
enforcement.

As my research has shown, [these [**operations** come at a
**cost**]{.mark}: They [have **shrunk** and]{.mark} [**weakened**
the]{.mark} U.S. Navy's **[surface fleet]{.mark}** to a shadow of its
former self]{.underline}. The reasons lie in politics, poor strategic
foresight, and bureaucracy. While critics usually describe the problem
as a mismatch between operational "demand" and the "supply" of ships,
this mismatch is itself a symptom of an underlying national confusion
about the purpose of the Navy itself. The hard truth is that stale ideas
about America's proper role in the world have outlived the geopolitical
circumstances in which they germinated.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, U.S. policymakers saw a new world
marked by brush-fire conflicts, civil wars, and economic dislocation due
to globalization. Global policing, albeit under more the palatable terms
like "engagement" or "liberal internationalism," became the dominant
foreign policy consensus. To offer flexibility for these brush fires,
the Navy designed its fleet around carrier strike groups and amphibious
readiness groups. The Navy made this case --- that an uncertain world
required presence, and presence required carriers, amphibious ships, and
supporting multi-mission combatants --- in its own planning documents,
and led a public relations campaign to this effect. The 1993 Bottom-Up
Review (the Department of Defense's seminal assessment of required force
structure for the post-Cold War era), under a section entitled "naval
presence," explicitly stated that naval forward presence would require
more large-deck ships than the Navy would need if it used the same
force-planning metric as the other services (the two "major regional
contingency" standard). In other words, "presence" as an idea was good
for the Navy's bottom line --- at first.

Circumstances soon changed. First, the large, exquisite ships that
carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups required were
expensive. Over time, this drove up customer costs and lifecycle costs,
and inhibited alternative force structures and platform choices, because
the coalition of contractors and policymakers benefiting from the
presence-oriented force structure objected to changes. Accordingly, with
time, the Navy purchased fewer vessels overall, and the fleet began to
shrink.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military's geographic combatant commanders ---
empowered a few years earlier under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act ---
began demanding surface ships for nearly every crisis that arose in
their theaters. Policymakers, too, grew accustomed to "showing the
flag." Sending a carrier strike group to a hot zone was appealing, as it
avoided the political risk and financial cost of overseas basing and was
an easy way to ratchet diplomatic pressure up and down.

In essence, the Navy did its job too well: It designed a fleet and
promoted a concept for operating it that policymakers and combatant
commanders found addictive. So, throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s,
the surface fleet got busier and busier while becoming smaller and
smaller.

Like a car, a ship can only be run so hard until it becomes too
expensive to maintain. As the Navy overused its ships, they retired
early. Other ships picked up their slack and were then overused
themselves. To support the rising tempo of operations, the Navy
repeatedly delayed maintenance on ships. America's shipyards, which
required predictable contracts to remain economically viable, bled
skilled laborers, driving up costs in an endless cycle.

The result was that the surface fleet shrank from over 400 ships in 1994
to an all-time-low of 272 vessels during the Obama administration
(today, it sits at around 300). Even with an ongoing multi-decade,
multi-billion-dollar investment in the nation's public shipyards, the
U.S. Navy will not clear its maintenance backlogs until at least 2040.
Even the chief of naval operations recently acknowledged that the fleet
will not grow any time soon. [Wargames indicate that,]{.underline} [were
the United States to fight China, the U.S. Navy might eke out a
**nominal win**, but one that **blurs** the **line** between victory and
defeat, setting back **American military power** for a
**generation**.]{.underline}

The Readiness Trade-Off

How was all this allowed to happen?

Everyone, from the combatant commanders to the Navy, lost sight of the
trade-off between operational and structural readiness. "Operational"
readiness refers to the ability of existing military units to fight
tonight. "Structural" readiness refers to a military's ability to
generate sufficient mass for multiple rounds in a prolonged fight,
including factors like the health of the defense-industrial base. In
basic terms, an extremely high level of operational readiness is
required for global policing duties; whereas if the goal is fighting a
long war against a peer competitor, structural readiness is more
important. If resources are finite (which they always are), the two
trade off.

In brief, for three decades, [the U.S. Navy traded its [structural
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} (for great-power conflict) [for
**operational readiness**]{.underline} (to support naval forward
presence). It [[burned through]{.mark} its **[ships]{.mark}**, and
**debilitated its shipyards**]{.underline}, to [make sure it could
respond to whatever policymakers wanted, whenever they wanted it, no
matter how [irrelevant]{.mark} it was [to **deterrence**]{.mark} and
**warfighting**.]{.underline}

This was not a problem in the 1990s, when the same fleet busy with
presence operations could still fight off any foreseeable challenger.
But by 2015, given the rise of China, the Navy, oversight agencies,
contracted research organizations, and think tanks were all sounding
alarms. Navy leaders begged Congress, time and again, to reduce the
frequency with which Navy ships were deployed, so that the force could
recoup its readiness.

Then came the collisions. In 2017, two U.S. Navy destroyers, in separate
incidents, crashed into commercial ships, and 17 American sailors lost
their lives. Two investigations --- Secretary of the Navy Richard V.
Spencer's Strategic Readiness Review and Chief of Naval Operations John
M. Richardson's Comprehensive Review --- offered recommendations to
restore the Navy's readiness. The Navy's highest-level investigation
even recommended "condition\[ing\] congressional and executive branch
leaders to accept that the higher cost and time to achieve established
readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide." This never
happened, because Congress continued to assume the Navy could balance
both operational and structural readiness, as my research delineating
the hearings after the accidents has shown.

Legislation passed after the collisions resolved none of the Navy's
presence-induced headaches. Congress enacted reforms to restore
operational readiness but ignored the Navy's proposed reforms to improve
its structural readiness. The Strategic Readiness Review had proposed
changes to the Navy's readiness commands (such as eliminating the
so-called "Inouye Amendment") and changes to the adjudication of
combatant commanders' requests for forces. Instead, what the Navy got
was a little more officer training here, some sleep requirements for
officers there. After dipping for one year after the collisions, the
Navy's operational tempo continued its inexorable annual rise that began
in the 1990s. Presence was simply too popular an idea.

**[[Shipbuilding is Not Enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The U.S. Navy's **[readiness]{.mark}** [for **sustained
combat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- and hence its **ability** to deter
China --- [is]{.mark} in a **[catastrophic]{.mark} state**]{.underline}.
The Trump administration should give the U.S. Navy a fighting chance to
rebuild itself.

It can start with the unfinished business of 2017, reforming the global
force management process (the process by which the Department of Defense
adjudicates combatant commanders' requests for military forces) to
prioritize structural readiness over emergent demands. In this process,
the service chiefs and the joint staff consider combatant commander
needs in their theaters and recommend service assets that can be made
available to them. Should a combatant commander need forces in excess of
this established allocation (an "emergent requirement"), he or she can
submit a "request for forces." The idea that the services should "just
say no" to such requests is aspirational, but difficult. Why? Because
--- as the Strategic Readiness Review noted --- the Navy has developed a
culture of meeting non-stop (presence-driven) operational demands.

As the review also points out, [the multiple [overlapping
authorities]{.mark} and the adverse growth of staffs within the Navy has
[made]{.mark} tracking the long-term effects of operations]{.underline}
[on [**structural readiness** a **nightmare**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, the staff of the chief of naval operations, located in the
Pentagon, appears biased towards operational demands and can lose sight
of long-term readiness. The problem is not that the Navy lacks input in
global force management, but that the Navy still does not "say no"
enough. To resolve this, the review recommended establishing the initial
force availability as the "maximum supportable peacetime force," such
that any further combatant commander requests for forces can only be met
with forces moved from other theaters. This is, in essence, a hard cap
on what the Navy can do, ensuring that unready units are never sent to
meet the latest and greatest combatant commander request.

[But [emergent demands aside]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Navy [operational
tempo will still **remain too high** to]{.mark} [restore]{.mark}
**structural** **[readiness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration [should]{.underline} therefore
[reevaluate]{.underline} [the idea of **naval forward presence**
itself]{.underline}: the notion that America's Navy is foremost a
provider of global goods, and a global policeman, rather than the
preeminent warfighting force of a maritime power whose primary goals
ought to be deterring --- and if necessary, winning --- [a great-power
conflict.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should **give up its

Pacific. The struggle [is based on a **false premise**]{.mark} --- that
if the United States loses command of the seas, China will **step in**

U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [loses command of the maritime

However, by positioning China as an existential threat, the United

[S]{.underline}tates **[courts disaster]{.underline}** [when it
**overextends itself** by seeking military primacy in the region. There

**[[maritime]{.underline}]{.mark}** nature of American [[**power** is a
**double-edged sword**]{.underline}]{.mark}, specifically when it comes
to its competition with China. [American command over the maritime
commons allows the U.S. military to project power globally, but
[when]{.mark} that [power is projected at]{.mark} a **[great
distance]{.mark}** from U.S. shores, as in the Western Pacific, [U.S.
forces are]{.mark} particularly **[vulnerable]{.mark}** to measures
designed to **raise the costs of access**]{.underline}. First, [a
strategy of maintaining command of the maritime commons in the face of
anti-access measures exposes U.S. dependence on allied territory to
support deployed forces]{.underline} through basing, infrastructure, and
logistics. Second, [[as the costs]{.mark} and risks [of maintaining

[than for China. [Overcommitment]{.mark}]{.underline} has historically

especially **[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** [now that China is
capable of inflicting heavy costs upon the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Instead, the United States should, together with
its allies and partners, focus on denying China command of the Pacific
maritime commons. [[It is]{.mark} **cheaper** and [**easier** to
**deny** command of the seas than to exercise it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
If China cannot gain command of the seas, [[the]{.mark} Western [Pacific
will **remain** a contested environment]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [one
[that China **cannot break out**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[China would]{.mark} either be forced to **[accept the s]{.mark}tatus

[FROM BEFORE THE COMMON ERA until Pearl Harbor, great powers competed at
sea as much as on land.]{.underline} Carthage, Rome, and Troy fought
regularly on the waters of the Mediterranean. Enormous fleets---the 1588
Spanish Armada boasted 130 ships---plied the oceans, fighting other
fleets, seizing prizes, and staking claims to territory. Even in the
days of sail, warships crossed the world: early in the sixteenth
century, the Chinese and Portuguese navies clashed repeatedly near
what\'s now Hong Kong. For millennia, nations sunk into their navies
amounts that might have ended want, only to behold the investments
literally sink. During the modern era, Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States have
expended groaning chests of treasure on warships. Naval rivalries
between Britain and Germany helped ignite both world wars. The Pacific
Theater fighting of World War Il began in part because of America\'s
1940 decision to forward-deploy its fleet from California to Hawaii,
closer to Tokyo, and in part because Japan placed an existential wager
on the maritime theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the society
of famous persons who proved, following their deaths, to have been wrong
about practically everything. [Many centuries of an extravagant naval
arms race culminated]{.underline} in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte
Gulf, where 367 warships and 1,800 aircraft hammered at each other with
cannon, bombs, torpedoes, and battleship shells weighing up to 3,000
pounds apiece. [Then the **naval [arms race stopped]{.mark}**[. **So did
naval fighting**]{.mark}. The [**seas have been quiet** for]{.mark}
nearly **[seventy- five years]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps the
longest stretch without bloodshed on the waters since first the sail was
hoisted. [Some Argentine and British ships clashed during the 1982
Falklands conflict]{.underline}, and Iranian and Iraqi vessels scuffled
around oil tankers during the mid- 1980s, [but **[big fights]{.mark} at
sea [have come to a halt]{.mark}**[, as has]{.mark} the **great-power
[naval competition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [last time a major naval
battle occurred, India was not yet an independent nation]{.underline},
the solid-state transistor had not been invented, and the Dodgers played
in Brooklyn. [Century upon century of great-power competition at sea
ended with a **final score of 10---0**.]{.underline} That\'s the
[[number of supercarrier]{.mark} strike [groups possessed by the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [(ten) versus]{.mark} the number
possessed by [**all other** nation**s** combined
(zero).]{.mark}]{.underline} World War Il left the warships of the Axis
powers in Davy Jones\'s locker. The Soviet Union tried to step in with
bucket-of-bolts vessels that craved return to port; since about 1960,
the [[US Navy]{.mark} has **enforced hegemony over the blue
water**.]{.underline} \"Hegemony\" has a bad reputation in political
science, assumed always to be undesirable. In this case, the [[**size**,
**power**, and **competence**]{.mark} of the US Navy has **[banished
fighting]{.mark}** from much of Earth\'s surface. [For a
**half-century**, **no nation**]{.mark} **has [even attempted to
contest]{.mark} US [naval dominion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
[all-electric, stealth- hull cruisers the United States builds are so
advanced]{.underline} ---nicknamed \"arsenal ships\" for their
firepower---[that no other nation has even experimented with a vessel of
this general type.]{.underline} The [supercarrier strike groups that
America deploys---full-deck, nuclear-powered carriers]{.underline}
bearing long-range jets, [protected by guided-missile destroyers and
screened by nuclear submarines---are so potent]{.underline}, to say
nothing of so expensive ( naval hegemony cost the United States \$155
billion in 2017), [that no other nation has tried to build one.
[**China** and **Russia** **possess no**]{.mark} **nuclear
[supercarriers]{.mark}**[, and have **none under
construction**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The limited-deck, diesel-powered
carriers China began laying down in 2015 will be suitable for patrolling
coastal areas but not for the open ocean, while [everything the US Navy
builds is intended to travel beyond the horizon.]{.underline} Because
the US Navy operates far from the homes of Americans, many are not
attuned to its size and might. Soldiers can march in Fourth of July
parades, and Air Force fighters can perform Super Bowl flyovers; the
Navy\'s boats can be observed only on the waves. Most who live in other
nations are not attuned to the US Navy either. There\'s no compelling
reason to think about a well-behaved military force stationed on the
opposite side of the globe. Under US Navy hegemony, [piracy still
occurs, but great powers have not seized merchant ships in three
generations.]{.underline} That cargo ships whose decks are stacked with
containers of valuable goods can steam anywhere without fear of being
impounded by a warship is the unseen reason global trade took off, and
global trade benefits almost everyone, while reducing war. The reality
that the [US Navy rules the blue water both **reduces a historic cause
of conflict** and **enables the prosperity of the contemporary
era**.]{.underline} Speaking at West Point as president, Obama said that
the United States does not use its might to acquire territory or seize
resources. Instead, [American might is employed to pursue what US
leaders believe is best for the world.]{.underline} Such beliefs may be
wrong, even tragically so. But has any other nation that possessed
overwhelming military force ever refrained from using force for conquest
or pursuit of riches? That is the unseen question of the oceans---unseen
because fighting on the water has stopped.

[[More than]{.underline} **[80%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[US [Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} (USN) Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet [strike
[fighters]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[currently
[deemed]{.mark} [mission ready]{.mark},]{.underline}** [a dramatic
turnaround from]{.underline} **[significantly lower]{.underline}**
[readiness rates reported less than a decade ago.]{.underline} The navy
had reached the 80% rate for the twin-engined fighter and the related
EA-18G electronic-warfare variant in 2019. But the service has been able
to maintain its 80%-readiness target, service officials said earlier
this month. On 3 August, those [[officials]{.underline}
**[touted]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the jets' **[continued high
mission-ready rate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which comes after the USN
for several years pursued a **concerted effort to improve
readiness**]{.underline} for an aircraft it describes as the "backbone"
of its fighter fleet. US Navy Super Hornets until recently fleet
suffered from precariously low readiness levels, owing to budget
restrictions, high operational demands and an outdated maintenance
system The 80% mission-readiness rate contrasts sharply with the reality
just a few years earlier. In 2017, fewer than 50% of the navy's F/A-18s
and EA-18s were ready to fly. According to Cirim data, the USN had 416
E/F-model Super Hornets in active service at the start of 2023, and 152
EA-18Gs. Senior leaders in the USN are heaping praise on one officer --
Captain Jason Denney -- for overseeing the change. Denney took command
of the navy's F/A-18 and EA-18G programme office in 2019. Known as
PMA-265, the office manages acquisition, delivery and sustainment of the
two aircraft for the service. The year earlier, then-defence secretary
James Mattis had mandated that all fighter types in the US inventory
achieve readiness rates of 80% or greater before the US government's
fiscal year 2019 ended in September of that year. During
[Denney's]{.underline} tenure, which concluded on 3 August, the USN
F/A-18 programme [office rolled out]{.underline} a series of reforms
called [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [Naval Sustainment
System-Aviation]{.underline} ([[NSS-A]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- [a
programme]{.underline} [meant to]{.underline} **[address maintenance
failings]{.underline}** [and to [help]{.mark} the **service [meet the
80% goal]{.mark}.** The]{.underline} navy describes [NSS-A as a
"**data-informed**]{.underline}" [framework that seeks to]{.underline}
"**[increase spare parts]{.underline}**, **[enhance
capability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[maintain]{.underline}**
[aircraft at a faster rate]{.underline}". The improved logistics system,
combined with increasing defence budgets in recent years and an end to
most active-combat operations in the Middle East, appear to have
produced results. Speaking at the 3 August ceremony in which Denney
handed over command of PMA-265, Vice Admiral Francis Morley praised the
Super Hornet pilot's role in the transformation, noting the F/A-18 was
the only platform to reach the 80% readiness target by the end of
FY2019. Denney "pioneered [[the NSS-A mode]{.underline}l]{.mark}, and
this year [[surpassed]{.underline}
**[full-mission]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[capable [readiness
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for the first time in]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of the programme]{.underline}", Morely says. The
uniformed advisor to the assistant secretary of the navy for research,
development and acquisition also notes the NSS-A changes reduced the
per-aircraft maintenance cost by half for each F/A-18. In written
remarks, secretary of the navy Carlos Del Toro says Denney was
"instrumental" in developing [[the]{.mark} new sustainment
[framework]{.mark},]{.underline} which [[is]{.mark} now [being
used]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[across the]{.mark} [navy]{.mark}.** The
[improvements]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} F/A-18
[[readiness]{.underline} **[appear]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[to be
[lasting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The navy first reported surpassing the
80% threshold in 2019, and senior admirals at the 2023 Sea Air Space
conference April confirmed publicly that 372 Super Hornets were mission
capable at the time.

### Supply Chains \-\-- 1NC

#### Supply chains are stable\-\--huge resurgence in reshoring.

Ben **Harrison 23**. Reporter for Kaysun Injection Molding & Engineering
Solutions, has 25 years of experience in the injection molding and
plastics industry. "Benefits of Reshoring: How "Made in America" Impacts
Supply Chains." 2/1/23.
https://www.kaysun.com/blog/made-in-america-impacts-supply-chains

The escalation of the pandemic and global trade tensions exposed
inherent risk by disrupting the once-comfortable global manufacturing
and supply chain dynamic. Today, concerns still persist regarding supply
chain challenges and slow movement through ports. As [[manufacturers
take firmer control of]{.mark} the global [supply chain]{.mark} and
[invest in]{.mark} more [local production]{.mark}, they're enjoying the
benefits of "Made In America" manufacturing solutions]{.underline}.

MANUFACTURING & SUPPLY CHAIN STABILITY

[With a [growth rate of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[38%
year-over-yea]{.mark}r**, [reshoring]{.mark} of U.S. manufacturing
[is]{.mark} nearly **[skyrocketing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to
the Reshoring Initiative.1 Yes, that institution may be a bit biased
(their mission statement is "to bring good, well-paying manufacturing
jobs back to the United States"), but [the fact remains that reshoring
is surging.]{.underline}

By [reshoring --- or even "nearshoring]{.underline}" (conducting
operations in a country close to the U.S.) --- [[manufacturers have
**better control** of]{.mark} their supply chains, particularly
procuring and managing the [raw materials]{.mark} needed for fabricated
products, such as injection-molded applications.]{.underline}

[The supply chain [stability granted by **minimizing disruptions** and
**controlling costs**]{.mark}, turnaround time, and product quality is a
powerful argument for aligning with U.S. partner]{.underline}s. Despite
the benefits, persuading manufacturers that make purchase decisions
based solely on the bottom line (versus Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO)
isn't necessarily the slam-dunk argument it appears to be.

RESHORING IN ACTION IN 2023

Current supply chain challenges go beyond the recent global pandemic,
with delays now being caused by regional conflicts/wars and ongoing
environmental events/natural disasters.

Take the Russia-Ukraine war, for example. Supply chain disruptions have
increased freight charges, the price of several commodities has spiked,
and energy costs have skyrocketed, especially in Europe where resin
factories (along with the entire continent) are facing rolling energy
outages this winter.

In China, the seven-day New Year holiday --- and annual factory shutdown
--- that recently occurred will likely hit harder and be felt longer
this year due to rising COVID-19 cases. Updated protocols (the lifting
of restrictions and mandated lockdowns) could disrupt manufacturing for
a month or more. And that's just one, expected, shutdown. There is much
more speculation regarding China's manufacturing as we move further into
2023.

[It's easy to see why the pride and appeal of America-based suppliers is
prompting manufacturers to rethink their supply chains]{.underline}.
Late in 2022, in fact, tech giant [[Apple announced]{.mark} that it's
[accelerating]{.mark} the [expansion of]{.mark} its iPhone
[manufacturing]{.mark} outside of China]{.underline}, while its CEO, Tim
Cook, stated the [company's support of a new \$40 billion semiconductor
chip production plant [in Arizona]{.mark}]{.underline}.2

"MADE IN THE U.S.A." MAKES A DIFFERENCE

The headlines around reshoring often center around job creation.
Certainly, the [[influx of reshoring]{.mark} activity [has]{.mark} a
[direct impact on]{.mark} American jobs and, by extension, the [U.S.
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, manufacturers are wise to take an
even broader view of what Made In America could mean to profitable
manufacturing and supply chain structuring.

Back to the Reshoring Institute. According to their survey, there are
three ways American-made manufacturing offsets the typically higher
costs of reshored production:

[Americans are willing to pay 20-25% more for American-made
products]{.underline}; a small number is willing to spend an additional
50% for American-made goods3

Nearly half of American customers perceive products manufactured in
America as having better quality than those produced in other countries3

"Made in the U.S.A." information on product labels sway choices for
about 60% of Americans3

It's important to note that claiming "Made in the U.S.A." status for
products is not an arbitrary process. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
has stringent requirements and compliance standards that prevent
deception and unfairness in the marketplace. This makes working with
reputable injection molding suppliers that are committed to producing
American-made parts and components just that much more crucial.

Understanding the effectiveness of existing practices must figure
prominently on the agenda of the supply chain literature in the face of
the pandemic. Our second main finding indicates that both
[[**proactive** and **reactive**]{.mark} resilience-building
[activities]{.mark} have [**enhanced** supply]{.mark} chain
**[velocity]{.mark}** during the pandemic]{.underline}. Studying the
effect of supply chain risk management on supply chain resilience and

Sodhi et al. assert that [traditional approaches, such as
**redundancies**, can be **effective** during pandemics]{.underline}
\[[103](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib103)\].
Sharma and her colleagues state that focusing on resilience not only

reactive [strategies]{.mark} have **[helped]{.mark} companies** [to
**overcome**]{.mark} problems in their [supply]{.mark}
chains]{.underline}. Although these findings are valuable, the area
remains open to additional investigation.

Highly contradicting findings and diverse perspectives exist in the
pandemic-era supply chain literature. Nevertheless, we know that the
pandemic has affected every industry differently; thus, no
one-size-fits-all solution exists. The extant literature on supply chain
resilience in the pandemic context emphasises the need to think outside
the box. Supply chains must be reconsidered and redesigned to enhance
their viability
\[[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib37),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib48),[101](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib101),[\[104\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib104), [\[105\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib105), [\[106\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib106)\].
Our results reveal that existing resilience-building approaches are
effective but insufficient.

We also know that the pandemic has changed every aspect of life. Some of
these changes will persist in the post-pandemic period, while others
will be discarded as soon as possible
\[[107](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib107),[108](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib108)\].
In any case, people, firms and supply chains will continue to face new
demands and new concerns that require innovativeness. Thus,
post-pandemic markets may include highly innovative actors
\[[109](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003225?via%3Dihub#bib109)\]
who have experience in failing supply chains. We predict that the supply
chain management discipline is poised to enter an extremely innovative
era, whose seeds the pandemic has sown. Our findings clearly demonstrate
the crucial role of innovation in resilience building. Therefore, the
next step should be qualitative analyses of success and failure stories
to gather in-depth information and identify the critical decisions that
brought failure and the critical innovations that produced success. We
suggest that future researchers concentrate on qualitative studies to
accumulate insights useful for building more resilient supply chains.

6. Conclusions

[**[Supply chain]{.mark}** failure[**s** during]{.mark} the
**[COVID]{.mark}**-19 pandemic **[motivated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
researchers to re-examine supply chains from [a
**[resilience]{.mark}-building** perspective]{.underline}. Our study
makes the following contributions to this end:

1.  We adopted supply chain velocity as a measure of supply chain
    resilience and attempted to understand the factors that impact it.

2.  We demonstrated that [both **proactive** and **reactive** approaches
    have promoted **supply chain resilience**. [Innovation seems]{.mark}
    an **[effective]{.mark} way** [to]{.mark} avoid or at least
    **[mitigate]{.mark}** the pandemic\'s]{.underline} devastating
    [[effects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No supply chains impact\-\--pandemic shocks, ransomware, and previous blockages disprove, and they're [inevitable]{.underline}.

[[We\'re in a **disruption economy**]{.mark}. **[Pandemic
shortages]{.mark}**, a **weeklong [blockage]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[Suez Canal]{.mark}**, the **[daily]{.mark} scourge** of
**[ransomware]{.mark}**, all come from a common pain point: **Global
[supply chains]{.mark}** [have become **fragile**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Isolated interruptions to individual supply chains feel like a thing of
the past. Today, the [[risks]{.mark} are more likely to [**cut across
supply chains** and leave companies vulnerable]{.mark} to
shared]{.underline} or cascading [threats]{.underline}.

If we want to make supply chains more resilient, it\'s time to apply
some stress tests.

The Rationale for Stress Tests

After 2008 put systemic risks on full display, the banking world turned
to stress tests as a tool for hardening financial networks against the
next crisis. This might be the right tool for strengthening our supply
chains, too.

The [networks behind our global economy are showing cracks.
**Automakers** have **cut production** as they compete for chips in a
global semiconductor shortage. Home builders are struggling to acquire
enough lumber]{.underline}. And a [second wave of COVID-19 cases in
India constrained global vaccine supply]{.underline}. These
[incidents]{.underline} stem from misalignments in the pandemic economy,
but they [could have just as easily been caused by other forms of supply
disruption]{.underline}.

[Semiconductor production, for instance, is very heavily concentrated in
Taiwan]{.underline}; the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
alone is responsible for more than half of the global chip supply. The
chip shortage has highlighted TSMC as a central risk to supply chains
should [[**rising U.S.-China tensions** threaten **access**]{.mark} to
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Taiwan [faces]{.mark} **severe [climate
risks]{.mark}**, too, as a historic **drought** is affecting the
water-intensive **fabrication process**]{.underline}.

[Cyberattacks have become a seemingly endless source of
disruption]{.underline}. The [[Kaseya]{.mark} ransomware [attack]{.mark}
recently [interrupted **1,500 organizations**]{.mark} across the
world]{.underline}. That came less than a month after an incident
against [[JBS]{.mark} USA [interrupted]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**global [food supply chain]{.mark}** [and another]{.mark} cyberattack
[disrupted **U.S. gas**]{.mark} **supplies**]{.underline}. This wave [of
attacks spreading through software supply chains has no end in
sight]{.underline}. And [[global supply chain]{.mark} network[s]{.mark}
[allow]{.mark} each of these [isolated shocks to]{.mark} spread and
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}---a fact that makes them an appealing target
for malicious hackers.
