#### Reconciliation will pass but Trump's PC is key 

**Hubbard 6/3/25** -- CBS News writer

Kaia Hubbard, "Senate forges ahead with tight timeline to approve
Trump\'s \"big beautiful bill\"", CBS News, 6/3/25,
<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-trump-big-beautiful-bill-timeline/>

Washington --- [The Senate is forging ahead this week on President
Trump\'s \"one big beautiful bill,\" facing a tight, self-imposed
deadline to get the legislation to his desk ahead of the July 4
holiday.]{.underline}

**[\"It\'s going to be a busy month --- we have a lot to get
done,\"]{.underline}** Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the
Senate floor Monday, **[adding that the upper chamber\'s \"biggest
focus\" will be on getting the president\'s agenda
passed.]{.underline}**

[In a razor-thin vote last month, the House passed the legislation,
which addresses the president\'s tax, defense and energy
priorities.]{.underline} The vote came after weeks of intraparty
disagreement over a number of provisions, like Medicaid restrictions.
[That bill has now made its way to the Senate, where some of the same
tensions exist --- and **new dynamics have begun to take
shape.**]{.underline}

[Thune, a South Dakota Republican, outlined to reporters Monday that the
process is underway, saying **\"I think we\'re on track --- I hope, at
least --- to be able to produce something that we can pass through the
Senate, send back to the House, have them pass and put on the
president\'s desk by the Fourth of July.\"**]{.underline}

[But Thune can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the
bill]{.underline}, with all Democrats expected to vote against it. A
handful of Senate Republicans have already expressed opposition to the
House-passed bill. GOP leaders will be focused on uniting the conference
around the bill, and possible changes, in the days ahead.

[The majority leader acknowledged the delicate balance on Monday,
telling reporters that the Senate bill will \"have to be tracked fairly
closely, obviously, with the House bill,\" citing its **\"fragile
majority**.\" Thune said the House \"struck a very delicate balance in
getting it passed in the House in the first place.\"]{.underline}

[\"But there are some things that senators want, you know, added to the
bill, or, you know, things that we would do slightly differently,\"
Thune said.]{.underline}

**[Meanwhile, the president took an active role in the process as the
Senate returned to Washington from recess on Monday. He met with Thune
and spoke with a handful of key Senate Republicans, including Sens. Ron
Johnson of Wisconsin and Josh Hawley of Missouri, who have expressed
opposition to some of the bill\'s components.]{.underline}**

[Johnson]{.underline}, along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, [has been
among the leading voices in the upper chamber calling for deeper
spending cuts in the bill]{.underline}, which aims at present to cut
\$1.5 trillion, while also advocating for separating a debt ceiling
increase from the legislation.

[The Wisconsin Republican said he had a \"very respectful conversation\"
with Mr. Trump, telling reporters that he and the president \"**by and
large share the same goal**,\" but have a \"difference in opinion in
terms of how to do it.\"]{.underline}

Paul has pledged to oppose the bill due to its debt ceiling increase.
Mr. Trump again called out the Kentucky Republican on Truth Social on
Tuesday, saying Paul \"votes NO on everything, but never has any
practical or constructive ideas.\"

Beyond concern about spending cuts, other Senate Republicans have voiced
concern for Medicaid restrictions, including Hawley. The Missouri
Republican told reporters Monday that the president told him when they
spoke that there should be \"no Medicaid benefit cuts,\" adding that he
told Mr. Trump that they are \"singing from the same hymnbook.\" But
Hawley remains concerned about changes to provider taxes and copay
requirements in the legislation.

**[The president also weighed in on Truth Social on Monday, urging
Senate Republicans to work quickly on the bill.]{.underline}**

[\"With the Senate coming back to Washington today, I call on all of my
Republican friends in the Senate and House to work as fast as they can
to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY,\" Mr. Trump
wrote.]{.underline}

Further complicating matters, the Senate also has to contend with strict
limits on the reconciliation process, which governs the legislation.
Though the process allows the Senate to bypass a 60-vote threshold
required to advance most legislation, it also comes with its own
hurdles. Under what\'s known as the Byrd rule, all provisions in the
legislation must have direct budgetary consequences. And senators may
challenge any portion of the bill that they say doesn\'t deal with
taxes, spending or the debt limit and ask the Senate parliamentarian to
resolve the dispute.

Thune said \"Byrd conversations\" have been going on for the last week
and would continue this week and next. And when asked whether Senate
Republicans would rule out overruling the parliamentarian, he told
reporters \"we\'re not going there.\"

#### Plan is another Alaskan earmark that contributes to the national debt -- ruptures Trump's fragile coalition

**Chien, Alaska Beacon writer, 6/13/24**

\[Lia, "Watchdog group, GOP U.S. House members blast 'reckless' earmark
spending",
<https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/06/13/watchdog-group-gop-u-s-house-members-blast-reckless-earmark-spending/>\]

WASHINGTON -- [A group opposed to wasteful government spending and a
handful of U.S. House Republicans warned at a Wednesday press event that
project-specific spending known as earmarks was contributing to an
increase in the national debt.]{.underline}

The event to discuss the Citizens Against Government Waste's latest
annual report, titled the 2024 Congressional Pig Book and released
Wednesday, highlighted congressional earmarks and called on lawmakers to
rein in government spending.

[Leaders of the nonpartisan organization, which works to oppose "waste,
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government," according to its
website, were **joined by Republican House members** and a live potbelly
pig to address earmarks and rising debt limits.]{.underline}

[The organization's annual pig book highlights earmarks, often called
"pork." An earmark is a project-specific funding allocation approved by
Congress through the annual appropriations process.]{.underline}

[The group identified 8,222 earmarks for fiscal year 2024, totaling
\$22.7 billion.]{.underline} That's 13% less than fiscal year 2023 but
still the fifth-highest spending year for earmarks since the CAGW began
releasing its annual report in 1991.

Republicans ended the controversial spending practice in 2011 after
winning control of the House. A decade later, Democrats and Republicans
voted to allow earmarked spending again.

[Defenders of the practice say it allows members of Congress, who know
the needs of their states and districts, to respond with specific
funding. The projects comprise a small portion of total federal
spending. And lawmakers have a chance to vote on them as part of
appropriations bills.]{.underline}

But some Republicans continue to oppose them. Four members on Wednesday
gave a similar rationale Wednesday as Republicans did when they
eliminated earmarks in 2011, calling them a form of wasteful government
spending that's adding to a rising national debt.

Rep. Bob Good, a Republican from Virginia, stressed how much debt the
country continues to accumulate.

["Here we are with \$35 trillion in debt," he said. "After it took us
about 200 years to accumulate the first trillion, now we're accumulating
a trillion every four months or so."]{.underline}

Data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and a CNBC analysis
confirms these amounts.

Good, the chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, criticized his
party for passing a 2023 law to suspend the debt limit. The measure
allowed Congress to appropriate "as much as we can joyfully, gleefully
spend together," Good said.

Speakers at the event, which included Reps. Debbie Lesko of Arizona,
Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Tom McClintock of California as well
as Good, shared the sentiment that permanently ditching earmarks would
help restore Republicans' reputation as the "fiscally responsible"
party.

"Republicans cannot reclaim the mantle of fiscal responsibility until we
end once and for all this reckless and self-indulgent practice,"
McClintock said.

Maine and Alaska benefit

[Members also spoke to the disproportionate allocation of earmarked
spending in Congress.]{.underline}

CAGW President Tom Schatz opened Wednesday's event by highlighting who
in Congress received the most funding in earmarks this fiscal year.
Earmarks are required to have a sponsor in the House and Senate.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and ranking member of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, took home the most bacon this year with
231 earmarks totaling \$576 million.

[That total was almost 24% more than the legislator with the
second-highest number of earmarks, Sen. Lisa **Murkowski, a Republican
from Alaska who is also on the Appropriations Committee. Murkowski's 185
earmarks amounted to \$466 million.**]{.underline}

[Members of the appropriations committees in the House and Senate, which
write the annual spending laws, gained much more in earmarks than the
average member, the report notes.]{.underline}

**["Earmarks continue to provide the most benefit to the most powerful
legislators,"]{.underline}** Schatz said.

The rest of the top five were Sen. Angus King of Maine, Democratic Sen.
Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. King
caucuses with Democrats, though he is an independent.

Together, these five senators received 10.3% of all earmark spending in
fiscal 2024, but make up less than 1% of all members of Congress.

Senators generally won more earmarked spending than their House
counterparts, with 37 of the top 40 lawmakers by dollar amount coming
from the Senate.

Schatz also spoke to the differences between the parties. Nearly all --
99.6% -- congressional Democrats took advantage of the spending
practice, while only 62.4% of Republicans did.

The CAGW president also noted an uneven distribution of funding among
states and territories.

States with smaller populations receive more "pork per capita," with
Alaska taking the top spot at \$645 in earmark spending per person.
Maine, with \$434 per person, and Hawaii at \$336, followed.

The bottom three jurisdictions included Indiana at \$4.32 per person,
Puerto Rico at \$3.67 per person and North Dakota, which received no
earmarks.

#### Failure to pass the bill means the US won't raise the debt ceiling

**Kapur, NBC News writer, 6/11/25**

\[Sahil, 6/11/25, NBC News, "\'There is no Plan B\': Republicans make a
daring bet on the debt limit",
<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/-no-plan-b-republicans-make-daring-bet-debt-limit-rcna212311>\]

WASHINGTON --- [As Republicans barrel toward a critical deadline this
summer to lift the debt ceiling, they say **there's no "Plan B" to avert
an economically disastrous default if they fail to pass the massive bill
for President Donald Trump\'s agenda in time.**]{.underline}

[Congressional Republicans are eyeing increasing the debt limit by \$4
trillion to \$5 trillion so the government can keep borrowing to meet
the country's obligations. It\'s part of their broader domestic policy
package, which the Senate needs to pass before it can go back through
the House and ultimately to Trump\'s desk for his signature. And **the
GOP only has three votes to spare in both chambers.**]{.underline}

**["There is no Plan B,"]{.underline}** Senate Majority Leader John
Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday when asked by NBC News if he has a backup
plan for the debt limit. **["It's Plan A. We have to get it done.
Failure is not an option."]{.underline}**

It's a risky gamble by [GOP leaders,]{.underline} who [are putting all
their chips on passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the debt
ceiling deadline.]{.underline}

**["We're going to get reconciliation done,"]{.underline}** Senate
Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said when asked what the party's
fallback plan is on the debt ceiling. (Reconciliation refers to the
budget process Republicans are using to pass their bill, which allows
them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and cut Democrats out
of the process.)

[The Treasury Department has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling
**\"by mid-July\"** to safely avoid default.]{.underline} The
Congressional Budget Office projected this week that the deadline may be
later, "between mid-August and the end of September," although that
won't be official unless the Treasury Department agrees.

If Republicans fail to pass their sprawling bill in time, they would
need to negotiate with Democrats to pass a standalone debt limit
extension through the 60-vote process in the Senate.

But there have been no negotiations between party leaders on that front,
according to Republican and Democratic aides with knowledge of the
dynamics. One GOP aide said the party is "full steam ahead on Plan A"
and suggested there may still be time to consider a fallback if they
absolutely need to.

#### Default [crashes]{.underline} the [global economy]{.underline} and triggers [quick great power war]{.underline}. 

Carlo J.V. **Caro 23**, Political and Military Analyst, MA Columbia
University, \"The Implications of a US Debt Default on National
Security,\" 5/30/2023,
https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/05/the-implications-of-a-us-debt-default-on-national-security/

Regardless of the deal between McCarthy and the White House through
2025, [if the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [were]{.underline} ever [to]{.underline}
hypothetically **[default]{.underline}** on its debts, [the]{.underline}
**[consequences]{.underline}** [would extend]{.underline}
**[beyond]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [**economy**,
affecting]{.underline} US **[military op]{.underline}**eration[**s**,
the]{.underline} [**defense industry**, and]{.underline} **[strategic
alliances]{.underline}** like NATO.

Throughout history, [economic crises have not only affected
the]{.underline} **[economy]{.underline}** [but]{.underline}
**[also]{.underline}** [led to]{.underline} political
**[instability]{.underline}** and shifts [in]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** power **[dynamics]{.underline}**. Take, for
example, the 1930s Great Depression, which indirectly
[spurred]{.underline} the rise of **[militarism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the initiation of **[World War]{.underline}** II by
destabilizing the economic foundations of the League of Nations. In a
similar vein, the 2008 financial crisis caused the West's economic
position to weaken and shifted global power toward the East.

The Great Depression and World War II

The Great Depression provides a historical context of the potential
impact of a U.S. debt default in 2023. Like the Depression, a debt
[default would entail]{.underline} an economic **[shock]{.underline}**
[that could trigger]{.underline} a [**deep recession**,
with]{.underline} **[far-reaching effects]{.underline}** on the economy,
government spending, and by extension, military readiness. [This
could]{.underline} potentially **[disadvantage]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[U.S.]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[any
escalating conflict]{.underline}** with a well-resourced and
technologically advanced military power like China.

Even though a debt default would precipitate a severe economic crisis,
it would not exactly replicate the conditions of the Great Depression.
The global economic environment has changed drastically since the 1930s
and central banks and governments have developed more advanced monetary
and fiscal tools to manage it.

However, [since]{.underline} US [Treasury bonds]{.underline} are
considered the safest asset in the world and [form the]{.underline}
**[backbone]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} global [**financial
system**, a]{.underline} debt **[default]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} **[undermine]{.underline}** this
**[trust]{.underline}**, potentially causing a surge in interest rates
as investors demand higher yields to compensate for the increased risk,
[**leading** to a]{.underline} drop in the value of the dollar and a
**[global]{.underline}** financial **[shock]{.underline}**.

[**Domestically**, a default could trigger a]{.underline} **[sharp
rise]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[borrowing costs]{.underline}**,
which would affect everything from mortgages to corporate loans. This
could cause a contraction in investment, leading to job losses and
drastic cuts to government services, particularly military programs.
Over the longer term, economic **[recovery]{.underline}** [could
be]{.underline} **[slow]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[painful]{.underline}**, as was the case following the Great
Depression.

The Great Depression had a profound effect on America's readiness for
World War II, owing to dire economic conditions, isolationist
tendencies, and stringent fiscal limitations, which negatively impacted
military preparedness. Post-1929, the government prioritized domestic
economic recovery, leading to a decreased defense budget, downsizing of
military forces, and reduction in military equipment. With a small and
under-equipped military, planners had adopted a strategy focused on the
defense of the Western Hemisphere, heavily relying on the nation's
industrial potential.

But by the 1930s, the US Army's active-duty strength was reduced to
about 130,000, causing an "experience gap" in the military and hindering
the development of emerging warfare areas. Low military wages and
limited training opportunities led to unattractive military service and
hampered the evolution of military doctrines.

The physical competence and battlefield skills of personnel waned,
leading to issues in adapting to advancing military technology and
warfare concepts. This under-preparedness influenced early strategies in
World War II, with a notable shift towards a "Europe First" policy and
attrition strategy in the Pacific Theater. The inability to swiftly
transition from a depression-era economy to a fully mobilized wartime
economy was evident. The US military had to significantly mobilize,
growing from 1.8 million in 1941 to over 12 million in 1945, but initial
setbacks spurred essential changes in military strategy, eventually
aiding victory.

The US Pacific Fleet's limited capabilities and insufficient forces led
to losses at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, and Hong
Kong, forcing defensive maneuvers while the military rebuilt and
expanded. Early battles like the defeat at the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia
revealed the under-preparedness of US troops against the German
Wehrmacht and exposed coordination issues in combined arms warfare,
prompting innovative adaptations and adjustments that enhanced
operational performance.

The US quickly developed techniques and organizational structures for
amphibious operations despite initial shortcomings. Issues in submarine
warfare due to fiscal and technological constraints were addressed by
mid-1943, leading to a more aggressive approach. Improvements in jungle
warfare training and the introduction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
marked a shift towards integrated planning.

The attack on Pearl Harbor highlighted the need for effective
intelligence, prompting the military's intelligence reorganization.
Challenges in strategic bombing were addressed over time, and the U.S.
leveraged its economic potential and invested in war production,
overcoming initial hurdles, and significantly increasing military
output.

American factories, dormant during the Depression, were suddenly tasked
with producing vast amounts of military equipment. This dramatic
conversion posed an immense challenge, testing the country's industrial
flexibility and resilience. Despite initial difficulties in converting
civilian industry for war production due to laissez-faire economic
policies, the government responded with public works programs and
stabilization policies. The War Production Board and the Office of Price
Administration were established to coordinate war production and control
wages and prices.

Even though the U.S. had robust manufacturing capabilities and a large
labor force, the redirection of these assets for war was challenging.
Integration of the available labor force into war industries and a shift
to mass production techniques strained the industrial sector. Despite
these challenges, the mobilization process exemplified the nation's
resilience.

Impact of a Debt Default

A debt [default could affect]{.underline} the
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense[**'s budget**, global]{.underline} [**military
operations**, and]{.underline} America's [ability to]{.underline}
**[counter global instability]{.underline}**. This could result in
severe budget constraints, leading to a potential reduction in troop
numbers, a slowdown in military modernization, and a decline in
operational readiness.

In the wake of a default, the Pentagon's budget would inevitably face
scrutiny, with repercussions potentially affecting morale, retention
rates, and operational capabilities. Further, it could disrupt military
operations abroad, [empowering]{.underline} [**adversarial actors**,
**destabilizing regions**, and]{.underline} **[escalating the risk of
conflict]{.underline}**.

Moreover, budgetary constraints could compromise the military's
technological edge by impacting modernization efforts. This could also
result in the slowing of replacement rates for aging military equipment
and reduced funding for research and development programs, thereby
[eroding]{.underline} [American]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nological **[edge]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
operational readiness.

There would be significant implications for the transition to
Multidomain Operations (MDO) and potentially [weaken]{.underline} U.S.
**[strategic dominance]{.underline}** across multiple domains. Funding
for research, development, training, and implementation of MDO could be
severely compromised. **[China]{.underline}** [could]{.underline}
**[take advantage]{.underline}** of the situation, strengthening its
respective A2/AD capabilities and presence in strategic areas, thereby
[posing]{.underline} more **[significant challenges]{.underline}** to
the MDO transition.

The legal complexities associated with MDO,
**[particularly]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} newer [domains
like]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}**space [and]{.underline}
**[space]{.underline}**, could be further complicated due to reduced
funding for policy development, legal research, and international
negotiation efforts. In essence, the U.S. military's ability to
effectively adapt to the changing landscape of warfare would be affected
[and]{.underline} could [result in]{.underline} **[strategic
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**.

The consequences of a debt default could also permeate into intelligence
and cyber operations. A constrained budget could disrupt the operations
of the intelligence community, impairing strategic and tactical
capabilities, and leading to a heightened risk of strategic threats.

Historical events, like the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of
the Islamic State, underline the dangers of potential intelligence gaps
caused by budget cuts. In addition, these constraints may affect the
recruitment and retention of talented personnel, diminish the quality of
intelligence analysis, and lead to policy errors with significant
repercussions.

Simultaneously, a debt default could affect the nation's ability to
execute and counter cyber operations,. U.S. Cyber Command could face
obstacles due to budget reductions, potentially impacting the
development and deployment of advanced cyber weaponry, and
[leaving]{.underline} **[critical infrastructure]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} military **[command]{.underline}**
[systems]{.underline} **[vulnerable]{.underline}**.

A debt default could also drastically impact the defense industry.
[Diminished]{.underline} defense [spending could undercut
America's]{.underline} **[d]{.underline}**efense
**[i]{.underline}**ndustrial **[b]{.underline}**ase. This would hinder
the country's ability to maintain technological superiority over
potential adversaries.

Additionally, a debt default could significantly affect the production
of military hardware. The resulting [diminished]{.underline}
**[orders]{.underline}**, job losses, and potential closures of defense
firms could erode the capacity of the United States to regenerate
military capabilities swiftly during crises. This [could increase
reliance on]{.underline} **[foreign]{.underline}**-made
**[components]{.underline}**, potentially [exposing the]{.underline} US
[military to]{.underline} greater [risks of]{.underline}
**[espionage]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[sabotage]{.underline}**.

NATO, a bulwark of international security, is susceptible to member
states' financial instability. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted
this vulnerability, inducing defense budget constraints and spurring a
new "Smart Defense" strategy of prioritization, specialization, and
collaboration among members. However, this induced regional imbalances,
as wealthier nations focused on high-end capabilities, while others were
assigned niche areas.

The global financial crisis amplified calls for burden-sharing among
alliance members. US defense spending was curtailed by the 2011 Budget
Control Act. Additionally, the crisis impacted NATO's relations with
other powers. Russia exploited the situation to challenge NATO (e.g.,
the 2008 Georgia War), while China used it to enhance global economic
influence in hard-hit countries like Greece and Portugal, thereby
testing the transatlantic bond.

Operational and logistical challenges also emerged for NATO, as the U.S.
withdrawing some support from Europe. Initiatives like the European Air
Transport Command were set up to optimize limited resources. The crisis
impacted NATO's operational tempo, with financial constraints forcing
members to reduce troop contributions to operations like Afghanistan and
the Balkans.

A future crisis, such as [a US]{.underline} **[debt
default]{.underline}**, [could]{.underline}
**[dramatically]{.underline}** affect NATO. A debt default would affect
America's ability to contribute to the Atlantic alliance and hurt the
economies of other NATO members. Such a crisis could undermine
collective security, **[destabilize]{.underline}** the alliance, force
policy reassessment, disrupt internal dynamics, and potentially fragment
the **[alliance]{.underline}**. Increased European defense autonomy
could arise, along with disputes over strategic priorities and resource
allocation.

Historical internal **[disputes]{.underline}** could intensify,
[impacting]{.underline} decision-making, **[security]{.underline}**
responses, [and]{.underline} **[trust]{.underline}** within the
alliance. [This could lead to]{.underline} a security dilemma and
**[regional tension]{.underline}**. The potential NATO
**[fragmentation]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} boost bilateralism
in international security affairs, **[emboldening]{.underline}**
[assertive]{.underline} **[global actors]{.underline}**
[like]{.underline} [**China**, or]{.underline} adversaries like
[**Russia**, to]{.underline} **[exploit]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[situation]{.underline}**. Non-state actors could also exploit a
diminished NATO response capacity.

A U.S. debt default might significantly impair NATO's cyber defense
capabilities. Reduced U.S. contribution [could expose the alliance and
its members to]{.underline} [**increase**d]{.underline} cyber
**[threats]{.underline}**, having serious strategic implications.
Operational and logistical challenges could intensify, with possible
downsizing or termination of planned projects, potentially leading to
capability shortfalls among European NATO members. In summary, financial
instability among NATO members could significantly impact the alliance's
overall function and effectiveness.

### Will Pass & PC Key

#### Trump is using ICE protests to drive GOP pressure -- that'll get the bill to pass

**Weaver, The Hill writer, 6/10/25**

\[Al, 6/10/25, The Hill, "Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' gets boost from
LA immigration protests",
https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5343114-trump-big-beautiful-bill-la-immigration-protests/,
accessed 6/12/25\]

[The protests in Los Angeles over the White House's deportation efforts
are providing **a boost to the GOP's "big, beautiful bill" as members
come under pressure to approve fresh immigration enforcement funding or
risk appearing on the side of California Democrats.**]{.underline}

[The White House and administration allies are using the protests to
push members to line up behind the massive piece of legislation,
**highlighting the package's border provisions** while making the case
that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) needs an infusion of
support.]{.underline}

"It's been a high priority before what happened in Los Angeles, and I
think the American people are seeing firsthand what happens when
lawlessness rules the streets and you're undercutting the very important
mission of ICE," Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), a top ally of Senate
Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), said.

"It helps illustrate the consequences of not having ICE fully supported,
whether that is supported by government officials, as well as the needed
financial support to make sure they have the capacity to do their job,"
Daines added.

[Senate Republicans are in the midst of a key week in the process of
passing the bill --- the linchpin of the party's overall agenda --- with
an eye toward completing work by July 4.]{.underline} Though leaders are
hoping to roll out key portions of the bill, deep divisions remain on
crucial issues including taxes, deficit reduction, Medicaid and more.

#### Trump's PC is key to passage

**Popli, TIME reporter, 5/20/25**

\[Nik, TIME Magazine, 5/20/25, "Trump Pushes Divided Republicans to Get
Behind His 'Big, Beautiful Bill'",
<https://time.com/7287051/trump-house-republicans-tax-spending-bill/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

President Donald [Trump arrived on Capitol Hill on Tuesday with a
warning to House Republicans: **vote against his massive tax and
spending bill, and you might get primaried.**]{.underline}

**[It was a characteristic bit of strong-arming from Trump as
negotiations over his sprawling legislative package are on thin
ice.]{.underline}** [The legislation, which Trump has dubbed a "big,
beautiful bill," seeks to extend his 2017 tax cuts and reshape federal
spending priorities.]{.underline} Critics say it would deepen the
deficit and tear holes in the safety net, though the White House insists
it would save the government \$1.6 trillion.

["Possibly," Trump said when asked if lawmakers who oppose the bill
should face primary challengers. "They wouldn't be a Republican much
longer. They would be knocked out so fast."]{.underline}

[Trump spoke with House Republicans for more than an hour in what
appeared to be part pep rally, part pressure campaign.]{.underline} He
cheered on House Speaker Mike Johnson and declared the Republican Party
"tremendously unified." But [he also showed little tolerance for
intraparty resistance.]{.underline} Among those in his crosshairs was
Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has
been outspoken in his criticism of the bill's spending levels.

"He doesn't understand government," Trump told reporters outside the
room. "He should be voted out of office."

Massie confirmed after the meeting that he remains opposed to the bill
despite Trump calling him out personally. "You got to take some of the
attacks with a grain of salt," he said.

House Speaker Mike [Johnson still believes July 4 is a realistic target
for **passing** President Donald Trump's **"big beautiful bill,"** as
Republicans in the Senate weigh changes to a package that cleared the
House by just a single vote in May.]{.underline}

But [Johnson, while seated alongside Trump at a White House roundtable
with business leaders on Monday, said he hopes the Senate uses a "light
touch" in its modifications of the sweeping megabill.]{.underline}

"We certainly hope, I believe, we can still meet that,"
[Johnson]{.underline} said. "It's up to the Senate, the bill's in the
Senate's hands now. But I [spoke with Leader Thune as recently as last
night, he's feeling very optimistic."]{.underline}

**[The president chimed in, telling reporters "I think it's gonna go
pretty quickly."]{.underline}**

[Johnson's optimism comes even as the bill has faced]{.underline} major
[pushback]{.underline} from Elon Musk, the president's one-time ally.
Musk panned the package last week, calling it "a disgusting abomination"
and imploring Republicans to "kill the bill."

[Work on the megabill is continuing this week, with Sens. John Boozman
(R-Ark.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) set to brief colleagues on some of the
trickiest pieces of the package on Wednesday.]{.underline}

[Johnson cautioned the Senate against making too many changes to the
House-passed version, lest it upset the delicate equilibrium in his
caucus.]{.underline}

"I've encouraged my dear friends and colleagues over there, don't modify
it too much because we've got a very delicate balance that we reached,"
he said. "[And it took us a long time to get there. And we don't want to
upset that balance too much.]{.underline} So they're putting their
fingerprints on it."

#### Will pass -- House revised bill to pass Senate rules

**Hill et al, Politico writers, 6/9/25**

\[Meredith Lee Hill, Politico, Jordain Carney, Politico writer, Jennifer
Scholtes, Politico writer, 6/9/25, Politico, "House to make fixes to GOP
megabill to avoid 'fatal' ruling with Senate parliamentarian",
<https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/09/congress/house-technical-corrections-gop-megabill-00394907>\]

House [Republicans will try to fix issues with their megabill in the
Rules Committee this week based on provisions the Senate parliamentarian
has identified as non-compliant with the chamber's rules,]{.underline}
according to five people with direct knowledge of the plans.

[Republicans need to send their massive tax and spending package to the
Senate to make its own changes.]{.underline} But without making certain
revisions to the House-passed bill first, it could run afoul of the
chamber's parliamentarian.

In the words of one senior House GOP aide, granted anonymity to speak
candidly, [certain House-approved provisions could prove "fatal" to the
bill's ability to comply with the rules surrounding the
filibuster-skirting budget reconciliation process, which Republicans are
relying upon to pass their domestic policy measure without Democratic
votes.]{.underline}

[House GOP leaders are currently working through the bill text and will
either strike small pieces of the legislation or drop certain sections
altogether.]{.underline}

One provision the parliamentarian has raised concerns about is a
clearinghouse to crack down on duplicative food aid, Medicaid and other
safety net benefits, according to two other people aware of the emerging
plan. This issue is currently in limbo between two panel jurisdictions.

Among the many rules Senate Republicans must adhere to in a
reconciliation bill is that it can't include a policy that falls outside
the jurisdiction of one of the committees empowered through the budget
resolution Republicans approved in April to set parameters for the
larger package. It also can't include a policy that would affect federal
spending, when the committee in question was instructed to change
revenue.

[Lawmakers will work within the House Rules Committee to make these
tweaks,]{.underline} according to the people, inserting the new language
into an unrelated rule which the panel will adopt Tuesday to govern
floor consideration for other legislation.

**[That tactic would negate the need to have House Republicans vote on
the party-line tax and spending package as a standalone
measure,]{.underline}** when passing the bill the first time around
through a razor-thin GOP majority was a painful enough episode for
leadership.

The GOP plan to make technical corrections to the megabill inside the
Rules Committee was first reported by Punchbowl News.

#### Will pass -- GOP Senators are working around the clock to resolve disputes and pass legislation

**Carney & Hill, Politico writers, 6/9/25**

\[Jordain Carney, Meredith Lee Hill, Politico, 6/9/25, "Senate
Republicans to huddle Wednesday on megabill",
<https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/09/congress/senate-republicans-to-huddle-wednesday-on-megabill-00394338>\]

[Senate Republicans will huddle on Wednesday as they try to iron out
some of the trickiest parts of their "big, beautiful bill."]{.underline}

[GOP senators are expected to be briefed by committee chairs who have
yet to release their pieces of their party-line pack]{.underline} of tax
cuts and extensions, border security investments, energy policy and
more. Republicans held a similar meeting last week with panel leaders to
discuss the less contentious parts of the bill.

Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo is tentatively scheduled to be among the
Republicans to update colleagues at Wednesday's confab, according to
five Republican senators and staff granted anonymity to share details of
private deliberations. Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman
is also likely to brief the conference.

[The two Republican lawmakers are tasked with crafting some of the
trickiest parts of the package.]{.underline}

[Crapo has the drafting pen both on his party's tax priorities, as well
as changes to Medicaid and potentially Medicare.]{.underline} Senate
Finance had been expected to release text this Friday, but [Republicans
are preparing]{.underline} for that to slip until early next week [as
they navigate the state-and-local-tax deduction cap and other sticking
points.]{.underline}

Boozman, meanwhile, is facing pushback to a House proposal that would
require states to cover part of the cost of federal food assistance
benefits known as SNAP. At the same time the panel is struggling to hit
the \$150 billion in net savings Senate Republican leaders are pushing
for the agriculture portion of the megabill.

[Senate Republican leaders had been the Agriculture Committee to
expected to release text Wednesday, but that timeline is also looking
tenuous as more governors over this past weekend raised private issues
with the cost-share plans.]{.underline}

#### Will pass -- Senate changes to the bill are bipartisan!

**King & Hill, Politico writers, 6/9/25**

\[Robert King, Meredith Lee Hill, 6/9/25, Politico, "The Medicare tweak
Republicans are eyeing for their megabill is actually bipartisan",
<https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/09/congress/medicare-tweak-megabill-no-upcode-act-00394281>\]

[A Medicare proposal some Republicans want to include in their sweeping
megabill **has the backing of a key Democratic senator**
---]{.underline} though he doesn't want it included in the party-line
package.

Sen. Jeff [Merkley]{.underline} of Oregon [said in a statement that he
stands behind the No UPCODE Act]{.underline}, a bill co-sponsored with
Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy that tackles tools Medicare Advantage
plans use to get higher payments from the federal government ---
[calling it "common sense" that health insurers "shouldn't be allowed to
overcharge taxpayers for the care they deliver."]{.underline}

However, he said in the statement to POLITICO, the legislation should
instead be considered "through regular order, not in the context of a
partisan bill that will end up leaving 16 million people without health
care."

Still, [Merkley's statement standing up for the policy Republicans are
now eyeing for their domestic policy agenda could give the GOP cover as
they look to find more savings to offset costly tax cuts and other
provisions.]{.underline} Including No UPCODE could generate more than
\$100 billion in savings and help Senate Republicans soften some
politically tricky provisions in the House-passed megabill.

The House debated adding the bill to their version of the package but
eventually relented after Republicans in battleground districts
repeatedly warned it was too politically toxic. Now [GOP senators
say]{.underline} President Donald [Trump]{.underline} --- who had
repeatedly pledged to keep Medicare intact --- [has privately blessed
changes to the program so long as they are limited to addressing "waste,
fraud and abuse."]{.underline}

Even so, the discussion continues to cause heartburn in the GOP, with
Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri expressing outright opposition and a group
of House moderates feeling blindsided by the Senate discussions.

Key centrist Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said he'd need to talk to
Senate leadership about the scope of the proposal. "We specifically kept
that out," he said.

Speaker Mike Johnson demurred Friday when asked by POLITICO if he would
advise Senate Republicans to avoid touching Medicare, saying they
"haven't addressed that yet."

[It's not yet clear to what extent Democrats will seek to weaponize any
GOP attempts to target Medicare in their "big, beautiful bill" --- and
it could be tricky if the underlying policy Republicans embrace is
bipartisan.]{.underline} So far the opposition messaging has focused
largely on potential cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health
program for needy Americans.

Already, though, the possibility of adding the Cassidy-Merkley
legislation to the megabill has generated fierce pushback from the
insurance industry.

The president and CEO of the trade group representing most major U.S.
health insurers said Monday that the group opposes No UPCODE and making
any Medicare changes in the megabill.

"The President and Congressional leaders made a clear promise to seniors
that there would be no cuts to Medicare as part of the budget
reconciliation legislation," said Mike Tuffin of America's Health
Insurance Plans. "Last-minute attempts to cut Medicare Advantage to fund
other priorities would directly undermine that promise and lead to
higher costs and reductions in benefits for more than 34 million
seniors."

And Mary Beth Donahue, president and CEO of advocacy group Better
Medicare Alliance, which counts insurers among its members, said in a
statement Friday that the legislation amounts to a cut to benefits and
would "break a promise to millions of seniors who rely on it."

Cassidy said in a statement the legislation would help cut down on fraud
and waste in Medicare Advantage, which lets older Americans get a
private plan with additional benefits.

**["To say the No UPCODE Act has bipartisan support is an
understatement," he said.]{.underline}**

#### Will pass -- Trump is using LA unrest to push the bill

**Caputo, Axios writer, 6/10/25**

\[Marc, Axios, 6/10/25, "Trump using L.A. unrest to push his big bill in
D.C.",
<https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/trump-protests-big-bill-los-angeles-dc>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

President [Trump and his allies have a new message for wobbly
Republicans in Congress: **Either support his \"Big Beautiful Bill\" or
get bashed for backing the Los Angeles protesters waving Mexican flags
in front of burning cars.**]{.underline}

Why it matters: **[It\'s a sign of the political hardball Trump is
playing within his own party.]{.underline}** At the same time, [he\'s
squeezing California\'s Democratic leaders with what critics call an
over-the-top response to protests fueled by his immigration
crackdown.]{.underline}

**[The drama in L.A. has helped the White House shift some of its focus
from Trump\'s feud with Elon Musk and place it squarely on
immigration]{.underline}** --- [an issue on which Trump continues to
poll relatively well despite growing discontent over his aggressive push
for arrests and deportations.]{.underline}

As California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass accuse Trump
of escalating the tension there, [the White House sees a chance to
attack sanctuary city policies, embarrass Democrats and **show the need
for the immigration funding in the mammoth bill that most Republicans
strongly support.**]{.underline}

Zoom in: Trump has long backed using force --- even the military --- to
subdue destructive protests.

But his advisers say there was no master plan for immigration raids to
spark the type of protests and vandalism in L.A. that would lead Trump
to call in the National Guard, over Newsom and Bass\' objections.

The big picture: To Trump\'s team, Newsom\'s opposition, the televised
images of vandalized cars, and protesters throwing rocks and waving
foreign flags to oppose U.S. immigration arrests did more to boost the
White House\'s push to maintain GOP support for Trump\'s bill than any
of its recent talking points.

\"We see the riots in L.A. laden with political opportunity, in that
it\'s a fight between what Republicans say they want vs. the radical
left and protesters waving the Mexican flag in front of burning cars ---
and the Democrats supporting them,\" said a senior White House adviser.

**[\"It\'s the best BBB marketing ever. It has brought the critical
nature of increased border funding and immigration enforcement to the
fore,\"]{.underline}** said Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point
USA, a major voice in Republican advocacy.

**[\"Everyone we\'re talking to in the Senate says this put it over the
top.\"]{.underline}**

To Kolvet\'s point, Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate\'s Republican
conference, sent out three talking points Monday to his GOP colleagues
emphasizing Newsom\'s role and violent protestors.

Cotton also tussled with Newsom on X. In one reply, the senator posted a
picture of a masked demonstrator waving a Mexican flag atop a vandalized
car with flames in the background.

Reality check: There is a constitutional question about whether Trump is
empowered to call up the California National Guard when its governor is
opposed. Newsom is suing.

The context is dramatically different, but a president calling in the
Guard over a governor\'s objection has happened before. In 1968,
President Johnson did so to enforce civil rights laws amid opposition
from Alabama Gov. George Wallace.

Late Monday, Trump also moved to deploy Marines to Los Angeles, an
unprecedented escalation in modern times, further angering California
officials.

What they\'re saying: \"Republicans are trying to take away health care
from millions of Americans in order to give tax breaks to billionaires
--- so Trump is manufacturing a crisis, demonizing immigrants with
increasing extremism, cruelty and disregard for the law,\" California
Sen. Alex Padilla said on X Monday.

\"It\'s the Trump playbook.\"

But Padilla\'s post, which featured a TV news clip of him making the
comments, showed the messaging problem Democrats face. It was displayed
in a split screen of him talking juxtaposed with video of a burning car.

It wasn\'t clear Monday whether Trump\'s California political play was
changing any holdout Republicans\' votes on his signature bill.

Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, one of the few GOP no votes on the
legislation last month, still opposes the bill because of its deficits
and policies favoring state and local tax (SALT) deductions that
particularly benefit blue states.

\"The \'Big Beautiful Bill\' actually rewards Gov. Newsom\'s failed
polices with a \$100 billion gift to California in the form of increased
SALT deductions,\" he told Axios in a written statement.

The protests \"are a bitter reminder that Trump let California and NY
Republicans ransom his border security agenda,\" Massie added.

[Another congressional Republican who has serious problems with the bill
told Axios on background that \"this has always been the plan by BBB
supporters --- to use the border as pressure to not address the fiscal
impact of some/many of the taxes.\"]{.underline}

**[Trump\'s L.A. response is \"just a circumstance of not letting a
crisis go to waste.\"]{.underline}**

### Trump PC High Now

#### Trump's PC is high now -- control over the budget negotiations proves it

**Kashinsky et al, Politico writers, 6/12/25**

\[LISA KASHINSKY, BENJAMIN GUGGENHEIM, MIA MCCARTHY and CALEN RAZOR,
Politico, 6/12/25, "Trump jumps into a GOP tax cuts conundrum",
<https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2025/06/12/trump-jumps-into-a-gop-tax-cuts-conundrum-00402395>

President Donald [Trump is bullish about wanting a "big, beautiful bill"
on his desk in just three weeks. But to meet that goal, he'll have to
help settle a tricky tax fight.]{.underline}

[Trump will huddle with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Finance
Chair Mike Crapo at the White House this afternoon --- the day before
Senate Republican leaders want Crapo to release the bill text for the
tax policy portion of the megabill. A likely discussion topic: Crapo's
pledge in a GOP conference meeting Wednesday to make three business tax
cuts permanent.]{.underline}

The challenge isn't about rounding up GOP support for larger tax
deductions for research and development, debt interest and capital
expensing. It's how to pay for them all. The House-passed package
already extends the three deductions through 2029, but making them fully
permanent would cost an additional \$450 billion.

At the same time, House fiscal hawks are demanding that any additional
tax cuts be offset with dollar-for-dollar spending cuts. To achieve
that, Senate Republicans will likely suggest watering down Trump's
campaign pledges to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay.

But the White House is making clear behind the scenes that would be a
no-go, our Rachael Bade reports in her latest Corridors column.

["We're not willing to entertain any scaling back of our signature
promises," a Trump administration official told Rachael.]{.underline}

GOP senators are eyeing another potential savings avenue: Lowering the
state-and-local-tax deduction cap that the House had quadrupled to
\$40,000 as part of a crucial compromise with blue-state Republicans.
Those SALT Republicans are now threatening to torpedo the bill if that's
changed --- and House GOP leaders appear to be taking them seriously.

["Obviously, it was very heavily negotiated in the House and we don't
want to see it lower," House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told Mia
Wednesday.]{.underline}

[There's another reason Trump has every incentive to urge Thune and
Crapo not to meddle with the House's hard-fought tax provisions: He
doesn't want to slow down the process with any more "ping-pong\[ing\]"
of the legislation between the two chambers,]{.underline} the
administration official told Rachael.

[As the White House works to convince the Senate Republicans to lay off
the revisions, Senate leaders are working toward issuing final bill text
on June 23,]{.underline} followed by a vote-a-rama the back half of that
week, according to Sen. Markwayne Mullin. [That would go a long way in
allowing the House to meet the GOP's self-imposed July Fourth
deadline.]{.underline}

[Thune is quietly threatening to keep senators in town into that recess
week to make it happen. But some GOP senators are openly questioning
whether they can wrap their version of the tax-and-spending package by
that date, let alone pass the whole thing.]{.underline}

[If the Senate is able to adhere to its own timeline, it'll come down to
whether Speaker Mike Johnson can get his members to swallow the Senate's
changes --- and there's no guarantee how quickly that will
happen.]{.underline}

### AT PC Fake

#### It's real and finite -- lobbying has tradeoffs

What He Wants," https://d-nb.info/1164077325/34

Third, agenda-setting offers the White House the opportunity to
highlight its priorities, how they are distributed across various policy
issues, and in which way policies should be packaged (Rudalevige 2005,
437ff; Wayne 2009b, 317ff). Because [the resources of **any**
administration to lobby Congress are **not** infinite]{.underline} and
[the]{.underline} multiple [political arenas are]{.underline} usually
[**heavily crowded** with myriad policy items]{.underline} and problems
striving to be solved, [the White House needs to **prioritize** its
policy agenda. This involves]{.underline}, among other things, [to
select some issues **over** others, decide about **their
sequencing**]{.underline}, how to pursue them, [and how much
**p**]{.underline}olitical **[c]{.underline}**apital [it
wants]{.underline} or needs [to spend on **any given
item**]{.underline}. Therefore, [the administration will focus on
**certain** policies with **more** attention, on others with **less**,
depending on the]{.underline} prioritization by the president but also
upon other considerations, such as the overall density of the policy
[agenda or]{.underline} imminent pressures of the [time. The **trick**
is to **not** overwhelm Congress with the president's
**initiatives**]{.underline}. As Lyndon B. Johnson famously quipped,
["Congress is like a **Whiskey drinker**]{.underline}. You can put an
awful lot of whiskey into a man if you just let him sip it. But [if
you]{.underline} try to [force the **whole bottle down** his throat at
one time, he'll **throw it up**."]{.underline} (cited in Rudalevige
2002, 113). Thus, the failure to prioritize easily leads to overload of
Pennsylvania Avenue with Congress at the one end, and to excessive
demands and exhaustion for the White House at the other end. [The
**rocky start** of the Clinton]{.underline} administration
[**underlines** this argument: since the White House did not pursue a
**'rifle-approach**' to define **clear policy priorities**]{.underline}
for its initial months and then execute them, [it got lost in
**numerous**]{.underline} legislative **[battles and
mine-fields]{.underline}** early on in its first year. Instead [it
followed a '**shotgun-approach**' by addressing **as many issues as
possible at once** leading to]{.underline} an **[overkill and
chaos]{.underline}** (Rockman 1996; \`Sinclair 2000b).

#### Prefer the consensus of political science literature

Dr. Jason S. **Byers 20**, PhD in Political Science at the University of
Georgia, Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michiganj,
"Policymaking by the Executive: Examining the Fate of Presidential
Agenda Items," Congress & the Presidency 47(1)

[A **number of studies** have **show**n that Congress **considers**
current levels of presidential approval when passing
legislation]{.underline} (Brady and Volden 1998; Cohen et al. 2000;
Edwards 1980, 1989). [Early studies were able to find **correlations**
between approval ratings and success in Congress]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Edwards 1980; Ostrom and Simon 1985). However, later research
depicts the relationship between approval ratings and legislative
success as more conditional (Canes-Wrone and De Marchi 2002; Edwards
1989). [Supporting a piece of legislation championed by an unpopular
president could ultimately result in **negative consequences** for
members of **Congress**]{.underline}. If presidents propose legislation
to Congress that is salient with the mass electorate and has higher
levels of approval, however, then members stand to gain from supporting
the president.9

On a similar note, the honeymoon period of a president's initial time in
office has been shown to increase the likelihood of legislative success
(Beckmann and Godfrey 2007; Brace and Hinckley 1991; Farnsworth and
Lichter 2011; McCarty 1997). Presidents lose their favorability with the
public and with Congress the longer that they are in office (McCarty
1997), which is why they often push for significant legislative
accomplishments early in their term. Members of Congress are uniquely
aware of the public's sentiments after a presidential election,
especially because they share a common constituency with the president
and are more likely to capitulate to a president's agenda.10 Therefore,
a president should receive more cooperation from members of Congress for
their legislative agenda items earlier in his term.

We should also expect the president to have varying levels of success
depending on the policy in question (Ragsdale 2014). One area where the
president is more likely to succeed in Congress is in foreign policy.
The amount of knowledge the president possesses in matters of foreign
policy, compared to members of Congress, is usually much greater
(Canes-Wrone, Howell, and Lewis 2008; Wildavsky 1966). This information
asymmetry in foreign policy leads Congress to be relatively deferential
to the president's proposals, therefore often negating their need to act
unilaterally in order to achieve the president policy goals (Marshall
and Pacelle 2005).11 Furthermore, members of Congress often have little
incentive to get involved in foreign policy as there is little or no
direct electoral return for them (Mayhew 1974).12

A president's ability to pursue policies with Congress is also affected
by institutional features such as unified government, polarization,
filibuster or veto pivots, and the partisan composition of the chambers
(Bond and Fleisher 1990; Howell 2005; Krehbiel 1998; Mayhew 2011). Much
of the previous work on presidential success in Congress has focused on
the distinction between unified versus divided government and has found
that presidents are more likely to shift policy when there is unified
government, which makes intuitive sense (Barrett and Eshbaugh-Soha 2007;
Bond and Fleisher 1990; Mayhew 2011). If the same party controls the
presidency and both chambers of Congress, then it is reasonable to
assume that a majority of the legislation that is proposed by the
president will at least make it onto the legislative agenda. It also
follows that during times of divided government, the president would
have a harder time getting legislation passed through Congress as a
result of more divergent policy preferences, which therefore impedes
their ability to form the necessary coalition needed to move the status
quo (Mayhew 2005; Ragusa 2010).13 The effect of divided government is
likely to be exacerbated with greater polarization as well. As the
parties' ideologies diverge, fewer opportunities exist for bipartisan
compromise on issues, therefore potentially hampering the president's
ability to move policy.

Beyond simple majority status, the actual size of the president's party
within Congress also matters. Prior research demonstrates that the size
of the coalition that the president has within Congress affects the
likelihood that policy change is enacted (Bond and Fleisher 1990;
Deering and Maltzman 1999). A bare majority is insufficient unless there
is no diversity among members' ideologies, and even substantial
majorities may not suffice if one faction holds substantially different
policy preferences from the rest of the party (such as the Southern
Democrats during the 1950s and 1960s). Therefore, simple majority status
is not sufficient for understanding policy changes. Instead, one must
consider the size of the president's coalition and its ideological
homogeneity as well (Rohde 1991). Increasing the size of the coalition
the president has in Congress should result in an easier path in passing
legislation.14 This should be especially true during times of distinctly
different ideological preferences between the majority and minority
parties.

[A variety of factors could **influence the success** of a president's
legislative proposal in Congress]{.underline}. Based on the president's
proclivity to have legislative proposals realized through law, [the
previous factors will **influence** the **success or failure** of a
president's ability to have proposals **make it through
Congress**]{.underline}. Although presidents may not witness a specific
proposal become law, this does not mean their initiatives will
necessarily remain unrealized. Allowing an issue to remain at its status
quo is indeed an option; however, the president may also decide (or be
forced) to move policy unilaterally.15 There are a multitude of reasons
that a legislative proposal would receive no action by Congress or the
president. At times it is unclear why no action is initially taken in
Congress, because it is difficult to ascertain a legislator\'s
motivations in not pursuing a particular course of action. In addition,
the use of the Hastert Rule in the House and the filibuster in the
Senate could result in no action taken on specific policy proposals.
Gridlock is an issue that must be addressed before legislation moves out
of either chamber, which would stall progress and result in no action
taken by the legislative body. [**Unpopular** presidents usually
**struggle** to have their legislative proposals acted on by
Congress]{.underline} (Canes-Wrone and De Marchi 2002); based on the
fact that the public does not support the president, [Congress will
**decide not to act**]{.underline}. When dealing with legislative
proposals, there are two specific endings---either the status quo is
changed (i.e., Congress or the president creates a policy shift) or the
status quo remains the same and the proposal receives no action.

#### Even if it's not real, people think it's real which is sufficient

Presidency: The Presidential Authority Problem and the Political Power
Trap," Presidential Studies Quarterly 41(4)

The concept of political capital captures many of the aspects of a
president\'s political authority. Paul Light defines several components
of **[p]{.underline}**olitical **[c]{.underline}**apital: party support
of the president in Congress, public approval of the president\'s
conduct of his job, the president\'s electoral margin, and patronage
appointments (Light 1999, 15). Light derived this list from the
observations of 126 White House staff members he interviewed (1999, 14).
His indicators have two central uses. First, Light\'s [research reveals
that they are **central** to the "**players\'** perspective" in
Washington. That is, those "**in the game**" view these]{.underline}
items [as **crucial** for presidential effectiveness]{.underline}.
Second, they relate to many central aspects of political authority as
defined by Skowronek. So on both theoretical and practical levels, [the
**components** of **p**olitical **c**apital are central to the **fate of
presidencies**]{.underline}. The data here will reveal that [presidents
over the last 70 years have **suffered** from]{.underline} a trend of
[declining]{.underline} levels of **[p]{.underline}**olitical
**[c]{.underline}**apital, a trend that is at the heart of their
political authority problem.

over the US debt ceiling.]{.underline}

While Senate Minority Leader Chuck [Schumer took the brunt of his

passed their own plan to avert a shutdown.]{.underline}

[Now that House Speaker Mike Johnson proved he can squeeze through tough
legislation along party lines, the challenge for Democrats looks
different.]{.underline}

[If the GOP can't get the votes to lift the debt limit on its
own]{.underline} --- and Republican senators and aides are skeptical
they can, given resistance from fiscal hardliners --- [they'll need
Democratic votes]{.underline}. Democrats have two basic options: Engage
with Republicans on a bipartisan agreement that could include Democratic
priorities like disaster relief, or dig in and say it's the other
party's problem.

Democrats are discussing now how to avoid stumbling into another
internal split this summer when the US exhausts its borrowing limit,
according to interviews with a dozen party lawmakers. After the shutdown
fiasco, and given their voters' clamor for more pushback against the
Trump White House, they do not want to be caught flat-footed this time.

"We will need a strategy, and we need to be unified," Sen. Richard
Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Semafor. "We have leverage. And we should use
it."

The shutdown battle exposed Democrats' deep strategic divisions, and
they're entering the debt fight with lots of disparate ideas. As Schumer
starts preliminary talks with his leadership team, his caucus is
cleaving between those who want to use the US checkbook as leverage and
those who don't.

"A great deal depends on whether the experience of the last two weeks is
going to lead us to a more bipartisan effort in the future. That's the
threshold question," said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., of
the debt ceiling. "If the answer is yes, we can talk about it."

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who criticized most Democrats for flirting
with a shutdown this month, said that when it comes to the debt, "I
refuse to take a hostage like that."

"I can't support defaulting on our debt. It's just like shutting the
government down. The impact will be catastrophic," Fetterman told
Semafor on Tuesday. Fetterman then spotted Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,
and added: "He might disagree with me on that."

Sanders declined to comment for this story. Still, **[many Democrats
question why they should help Trump's party raise the debt ceiling when
Republicans are planning trillions of dollars in tax cuts that will
increase the deficit.]{.underline}**

"Why should we do that?" asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. "I want to
know what the Republicans are offering. They seem to think they can run
this government with no help from the Democrats. Let's watch them do
it."

### AT Default Impossible

#### GOP will default due to infighting from the plan -- Trump's term proves that hardliners must be convinced through political capital & broader cuts in a reconciliation bill

**Bowman 25** -- NBC News national politics reporter

Bridget, "GOP ponders how to raise the debt ceiling despite dozens of
members who\'ve always held out", NBC News, 1/24/25,
<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-ponders-raise-debt-ceiling-dozens-members-ve-always-held-rcna188824>

Members of President Donald [Trump's own party could complicate his
effort to avoid a standoff over extending the nation's borrowing limit
--- which means a complication for Trump's legislative plans overall as
he manages big promises and small Republican congressional
majorities.]{.underline}

[A dozen GOP senators and 49 House Republicans --- more than 20% of each
conference --- have never previously voted for a law raising the debt
ceiling,]{.underline} according to an analysis of roll call votes and
data from the Congressional Research Service.

While many GOP lawmakers have supported debt ceiling increases as part
of messaging votes that were destined to fail, [this group suggests
there is a sizable number of Republicans who may be more hesitant to
support increases that could actually take effect.]{.underline}

[That means raising the debt limit, a must-do for Trump, may not be as
simple]{.underline} as just packaging an increase with the "one big,
beautiful bill" that Trump wants to use as the main vehicle for his
second-term agenda, since that is unlikely to attract much in the way of
Democratic support.

Those internal divisions in the GOP appear to have driven some
discussions about attaching a debt limit increase to disaster assistance
for California following the recent devastating wildfires, rather than a
broader GOP package. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News'
"Meet the Press" on Sunday that attaching a debt limit increase to
California aid is "one of the things we're talking about."

[Republicans in recent years have used the debt ceiling as a negotiating
tool to push for broader spending cuts.]{.underline} The debt ceiling
sets the amount after which the Treasury Department can no longer borrow
money to pay the country's bills, and failing to extend it could result
in a national default.

[Trump is no stranger to opposition from his own party in debt ceiling
negotiations, and he isn't keen on rehashing the issue as he returns to
the White House. **Congress voted to suspend the debt limit three times
during Trump's first term as part of broader spending bills, and all
three measures drew a significant amount of GOP
opposition.**]{.underline}

#### Plan requires NASA which is unpopular -- goes against Trump's wishes, rebukes the House bill, and opens new budget fights

**Foust, SpaceNews writer, 6/10/25**

\[Jeff Foust, 6/10/25, SpaceNews, "Whitesides says budget proposal shows
the administration does not value NASA science",
<https://spacenews.com/whitesides-says-budget-proposal-shows-the-administration-does-not-value-nasa-science/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

WASHINGTON --- A leading Democratic member of the House Science
Committee says [the proposed steep cuts in NASA's fiscal year 2026
budget proposal show that the administration does not appreciate the
value of science not just to the NASA but the country in
general.]{.underline}

Speaking at a SpaceNews webinar June 10, Rep. George Whitesides
(D-Calif.), vice ranking member of the House Science Committee, sharply
criticized the fiscal year 2026 budget proposal for NASA, full details
of which were released May 30.

[The budget proposes a cut of nearly 25% for NASA's overall budget, the
largest single-year cut, as well as a nearly 50% cut to NASA science
programs. That would, if implemented, result in dozens of missions being
terminated.]{.underline}

[Whitesides called the proposed cuts "catastrophic]{.underline}" and
linked the NASA science cuts to broader reductions to science programs
at other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and
National Science Foundation.

["What underpins what we're seeing is, I think, a full-scale assault on
the scientific establishment," he said. "It seems like there is not an
understanding on the part of the administration of the importance of
science and technology in our economy and our leadership in the
world."]{.underline}

### Ice Breakers

#### Icebreakers are toxic in Congress -- empirics prove

**Hooper, Forbes senior contributor, 21**

\[Craig, 9/12/21, Forbes, "Congress Authorizes A Great Lakes Icebreaker

<https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2021/09/12/congress-authorizes-a-great-lakes-icebreaker-the-coast-guard-doesnt-need/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

[Put bluntly, **icebreakers are expensive assets**, and a purpose-built
icebreaker, needed only for a few weeks of service during particularly
hard winters, is a luxury.]{.underline} With big crews, a complex,
[power-dense engineering plant, and one of the most structurally
stressful mission-sets a surface vessel can have, **icebreakers cost a
lot to build, operate and maintain---and an un-needed one will do little
more than drain the Coast Guard's already meagre operations and
maintenance funding**.]{.underline} [Unless Congressman Gallagher and
the rest of the Great Lakes delegation free the Coast Guard to procure a
globally-deployable mid-sized icebreaker---capable of handling national
security taskings---**the amendment is a poor fit for the National
Defense Authorization Act. Without changes, Gallagher's poison-pill
legislation would be far better to try it's luck in a
less-likely-to-pass infrastructure or commerce-oriented funding
vehicle.**]{.underline}

#### Plan's unpopular! Congress hates thinking about icebreakers

**Funk, ProPublica writer, 1/23/25**

\[McKenzie Funk, ProPublica, "This Icebreaker Has Design Problems and a
History of Failure. It's America's Latest Military Vessel.",
<https://www.propublica.org/article/aiviq-icebreaker-military-coast-guard>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

But the U.S. icebreaker fleet is deteriorating. [The Coast Guard began
raising alarms about the problem decades ago, starting with a study
published in 1984. Russia, with its extensive northern coastline, now
has over 40 large icebreakers, and more under construction. The United
States has barely been able to keep two or three in
service.]{.underline}

[An urgent Coast Guard report to Congress in 2010 highlighted what has
become known as the "icebreaker gap"]{.underline}: If we didn't quickly
start building new ships, our existing icebreakers could go out of
commission before replacements were ready. [The study called for at
least six new icebreakers. Subsequent Coast Guard analysis has called
for eight or nine. **To date, the United States has built
zero.**]{.underline}

[Congress dragged its feet for years on funding icebreaker construction.
But the Coast Guard also slowed progress with overly optimistic
timelines, fuzzy cost estimates and a tendency to keep fiddling with new
designs, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Office
report.]{.underline} More than a decade in, construction on the first of
the new ships has finally just begun. [The Coast Guard's latest cost
estimate is \$1 billion per icebreaker, while the Congressional Budget
Office last year put it at \$1.6 billion to \$1.9 billion.]{.underline}

**[Icebreakers have "been the penultimate studied-to-death subject for
40 years,"]{.underline}** said Lawson Brigham, a former Coast Guard
heavy icebreaker commander who has a doctorate from Cambridge University
and has researched polar shipping since the 1980s.

[The longer the Coast Guard failed to build the ships it did want, the
more pressure it faced to settle for one it didn't.]{.underline} Chouest
seized the opportunity. The company invited Coast Guard officers to tour
the Aiviq as early as 2016 and soon sent over a lease proposal.

### AT -- No Spillover

#### [Cross-domain]{.underline} spillover occurs.

Dr. Jon C. **Rogowski 17**, Assistant Professor in the Department of
Government at Harvard University, Ph.D. in Political Science from the
University of Chicago, "Bargaining Commitments and Executive Reputation:
Legislative Response to Unilateral Action", 6/16/2017,
https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogowski/files/reputation.pdf

To address this question, I examine whether [a president's use of
unilateral **power**s in the **foreign policy** arena
**affects**]{.underline} his [**bargaining success** in agencies chiefly
concerned with **domestic** policy]{.underline}. This case provides a
difficult test for evaluating how [unilateral action affects bargaining
success **across domains**]{.underline}. Previous research details a
number of ways in which presidents are more successful realizing their
goals in foreign policy than they are in domestic policy (e.g.,
Canes-Wrone, Howell and Lewis 2008), in part because Congress may grant
the president greater deference due to informational advantages that
accompany the president's status as commander-in-chief and because he is
well-positioned to receive intelligence and other classified information
that may affect his decision making (Howell, Jackman and Rogowski 2013).
The findings from this research suggest that foreign policy
unilateralism poses a hard case for detecting its effect on subsequent
bargaining outcomes.

[From the set of significant executive orders issued
between]{.underline} 19[**45** and]{.underline} 20[**01**, I identified
the directives that clearly involved foreign policy]{.underline}. While
the bulk of these directives concerned defense and security, a number of
them concerned other foreign policy issues including trade and
immigration. Altogether, fully half (49.7%) of the significant executive
orders issued during this time period concerned foreign affairs. Using
these data on foreign policy executive orders, I estimate the regression
model shown above for only those agencies that concern domestic policy.
About three-quarters (57) of the 77 agencies in the budget data are
primarily concerned with domestic policy.

[The **results** are shown below in Table 2 and provide **clear
evidence** that a president's use of unilateral action to set foreign
policy **have implications** for his bargaining success for agencies
concerned with **domestic** policy]{.underline}. Consistent with the
findings in Table 1, the coefficient estimates of β3 are all strongly
negative and statistically significant.

Table 2 goes here.

The results from Table 2 confirm and extend the results from the main
set of analyses. [How presidents wield power has **implications** for
**subsequent success** in achieving their **legislative
goals**]{.underline}, with the nature of these implications dependent
upon the presence of the president's partisan allies in Congress.
Somewhat more speculatively, the findings in Table 2 suggest that
[presidents and Congress do **not** bargain policy **area by policy
area**; rather, a president's actions in **one policy domain** have
**implications** for the legislative response in **another policy
domain**.]{.underline} Furthermore, and consistent with other research
on the domestic politics of foreign policymaking (Howell and Pevehouse
2007; Kriner 2010; Milner and Tingley 2015), Congress does not grant the
president a blank check when it comes to setting the country's policies
in national security, defense, and trade. Rather, Congress's response to
unilateral action in the area of foreign policy appears to be quite
similar to its response to unilateral action on purely domestic policy
domains.

Over the past several years, American political leaders have rightly
focused on augmenting national power. [Faced with China's geopolitical
challenge, Washington has **boosted** its **defense budget**, stimulated
domestic **innovation**, built new international **partnerships**, and
moved to protect its **tech**nological **lead**]{.underline}. These
steps have won broad support in both parties and across very different
presidential administrations, and for good reason: A more powerful
United States, working ever more closely with likeminded partners, is
best placed to engage in long-term competition with Beijing.

In this context, [the **possibility** of a **default** on U.S.
debt]{.underline} --- which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warns could
occur as soon as June 1 --- [seems utterly **mystifying**]{.underline}.
[Defaulting on the nation's debt threatens **catastrophic** economic
**consequences** and would **seriously harm** **national
security**]{.underline}. [It's hard to think of a **single** American
**action** that would more effectively **reduce** its **global
standing**, influence and power --- and boost those of its chief
competitor]{.underline}.

The economic consequences of a default are real and well-rehearsed. An
inability to pay federal bills would roil financial markets and likely
tip the United States into recession. It would increase interest rates
and borrowing costs. It would harm American credibility, encourage
diversification away from U.S. bonds, and threaten the dollar's role as
the world's preeminent reserve currency. [**Military strength** and
**geopolitical influence** **rise and fall** with a country's economic
power, and a debt default would strike a **major blow** against them
**all**]{.underline}.

It would also degrade America's ability to effectively employ its
foreign policy tools. The dollar's extensive use to settle accounts
gives Washington extensive powers to impose financial sanctions. By
undermining confidence in the dollar, a default would likely encourage
countries to denominate trade and financial transactions in other
currencies, and to hold non-dollar official reserves as well. Already,
Beijing has encouraged its trade partners to invoice in renminbi and is
developing an alternative to the dollar-dominated SWIFT financial
messaging network. Such moves would erode Washington's ability to impose
the kind of economic sanctions it applied after Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.

[A default could have negative effects on **military power** as
well]{.underline}. [Defense represents the **largest category** of
federal **discretionary spending**, and a disruption in the government's
ability to pay bills would **harm** **readiness** and
**investment**]{.underline}. [Pentagon leaders]{.underline} have begun
[warning]{.underline} about their potential inability to pay troops on
time, and [the uncertainty could **delay** the **production** of **key
weapons systems**]{.underline}. The House has already postponed its
consideration of this year's defense authorization bill while debt
ceiling negotiations proceed.

The near-term diplomatic costs are starting to pile up as well.
President Biden, tied down in debt negotiations in Washington, cancelled
his scheduled visit to Papua New Guinea and his attendance at the Quad
meeting in Australia. A decade ago, President Obama missed the APEC
leader's meeting and the East Asian Summit in order to deal with a
government shutdown at home; allies fretted at America's absence while
Beijing crowed. Today the stakes are higher, and allies already worry
about American presence and leadership.

That points to perhaps the gravest national security consequence of a
debt default. [In the contest with China, Washington asks allies to
**cast their** economic and security **lots** with the United
States]{.underline}. For those would-be partners, the choice amounts to
a bet on the future of American power and competence.

Washington has, however, provided ample fodder for hesitation in recent
years: political polarization, the January 6 Capitol attacks and
Washington's crisis-prone decision-making invites questions about
America's ability to generate national solutions. The messy end to wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq suggest strategic incompetence and a reluctance
to match national security means to our stated ends. The enduring trend
toward protectionism and America First-style economic policy is spawning
questions among allies about where exactly their interests fit in U.S.
decision-making.

Such [doubts are naturally **catnip** to China]{.underline}, America's
chief competitor. [Beijing portrays the West as in terminal
**decline**]{.underline}, led by an increasingly divided United States
unable to deliver the world --- or even its own people --- the unity and
effectiveness they desire. America continues to coast, Chinese leaders
suggest, on the privileges it accrued during a unipolar moment,
including dollar dominance, the ability to impose sanctions,
disproportionate influence in international institutions, and
untrammeled military power. This dynamic, they say, is an artifact of
yesterday's world, and no longer reflective of a rising China and
dysfunctional America. It reflects, instead, the antiquated disarray of
Western democracies, in contrast to efficient and effective autocracy.
[A debt default would provide **enormous ammunition** to those pushing
the narrative of American decline]{.underline}.

parties have failed to rein in deficit spending fueled by the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, the 2008 financial crisis, growing entitlement

Congressional Hostage-Takers

The United States government reached its congressionally mandated legal
debt limit, \$31.4 trillion, on January 19th. This debt represents past
spending: Cutting the budget now won\'t make the debt go away. [If
Congress]{.underline} **[fails]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**raise
the debt limit**, the federal government could **default**]{.underline}
[on its]{.underline} **[debt payments]{.underline}**---something it has
never done before.

The federal debt limit was created by Congress in 1917. In recent
decades, there have been periodic standoffs (in 1985, 1997, 2011, and
2013), in which Republicans threatened to let the deadline to increase
the limit pass unless Democrats agreed to spending cuts in social
programs. [Neither side]{.underline} actually **[wanted]{.underline}**
the federal government to [default, but]{.underline}
**[brinksmanship]{.underline}** [served]{.underline} **[partisan
interests]{.underline}**. This time, **[some Republican]{.underline}**
House Freedom Caucus **[members]{.underline}** appear to [regard
an]{.underline} **[actual]{.underline}** debt **[default]{.underline}**
([not just the]{.underline} **[threat]{.underline}** [of
one]{.underline}) [as a]{.underline} **[useful tool]{.underline}** [to
force]{.underline} major **[government spending cuts]{.underline}**.

Government spending comes in three large categories---mandatory,
discretionary, and interest payments. Most federal spending is
mandatory, including Social Security and Medicare payments. Of
discretionary spending, defense accounts for more than half. Interest
payments on U.S. debt comprise the smallest of the three categories of
spending, but it is growing fast and may overtake the military budget by
2025 or 2026.

Some pundits equate debt ceiling fights with hostage negotiations. In
this instance, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) may have limited
ability to prevent his more radical colleagues from metaphorically
shooting their captive. McCarthy\'s leadership is fragile and in order
to gain it, he agreed to rules that will give extremists outsized
influence in upcoming negotiations. A single member will be able to
force a vote on the speakership, possibly plunging the entire body back
into days of voting to establish a new leader.

[Since **U.S. debt**]{.underline} (in the form of bonds and other
securities) **[anchors the global financial system, a default could
rattle economies across the globe]{.underline}**. **[Americans could
face a recession, and stock and bond markets would likely
plunge]{.underline}**. Still, exactly how a default would play out is
uncertain. Since the U.S. government\'s payment of its financial
obligations is mandated in the U.S. Constitution, it is conceivable that
a default could be averted by the courts. Nevertheless, **[there is a
very real possibility that not only Americans but millions or billions
around the globe could face hardship as a result of political hardball
tactics playing out in Washington, D.C.]{.underline}**

The [year 2023 finished with a series of]{.underline} spectacular and
**[dramatic bangs]{.underline}** as [the]{.underline} West's [war
with]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [over]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** [escalated again]{.underline}.

Following Ukraine's mostly failed strategic counteroffensive, the
Russian forces began their own advance - gaining more ground albeit at a
slow pace.

That change of fortunes coincided with Ukraine, and the notion that the
US and its allies should continue to support it, becoming a point of
political contention among western ruling elites.

Meanwhile, **[Israel's]{.underline}** counter-terrorism
**[operation]{.underline}** [against Hamas in the]{.underline} **[Gaza
strip]{.underline}** [has turned into a]{.underline} bloody,
**[protracted]{.underline}** [campaign]{.underline} that is causing even
greater divide in the west than the war in eastern Europe.

The [ashes of the fighting]{.underline} in Gaza [have]{.underline}
**[spread]{.underline}** [across the]{.underline}
**[Mid]{.underline}**dle **[East]{.underline}**, [igniting further
tensions]{.underline} in neighboring Lebanon and Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.

The latter has over the New Year [become the factor of global attention
because of the]{.underline} Houthi **[maritime]{.underline}** [terrorist
attacks against]{.underline} **[international shipping]{.underline}**
[in the]{.underline} strategically important [Strait of Bab
al-Mandab]{.underline}.

Finally, **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea's Kim Jon Un
[ordered]{.underline} his [troops to maintain an]{.underline}
"**[overwhelming]{.underline}** [war response capability" in preparation
for "an]{.underline} **[inevitable]{.underline}** [war on the Korean
peninsula" that could]{.underline} "**[breakout]{.underline}** [at any
time]{.underline}".

So, what does this all mean for the year ahead?

Major considerations

In my assessment, there are a series of key influences that are
continuing to shape international security and will have significant
impacts on national security of many nations, including Australia.

Firstly, [there is the]{.underline} global [effort to]{.underline}
**[prevent]{.underline}** [existing conflicts from]{.underline}
**[escalating]{.underline}** [in**to**]{.underline} **[major regional
wars]{.underline}**, combined with attempts to find diplomatic back
doors out of these wars.

In the first instance, that applies to Ukraine and the Middle East.

Secondly, [there is the]{.underline} need [to]{.underline}
**[contain]{.underline}** [geopolitical and military-strategic tensions
that have]{.underline} **[not yet spilled over]{.underline}** [into
armed conflict, but could]{.underline} **[soon]{.underline}** [do so
(see]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea,
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[Venezuela]{.underline}**).

[Adding to that, renewed]{.underline} **[nuclear-missile]{.underline}**
[rivalry]{.underline} between the US and Russia [and ongoing risks
the]{.underline} **[further proliferation]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction.

Thirdly, [all nations want]{.underline} regime
**[stability]{.underline}** and survival, as well as regional security.

That applies to case studies across all continents except for Australia
and includes milestone political events such as elections (with the US
and Russia being focal points).

[And don't forget the]{.underline} **[terrorism-related risks
as]{.underline}** they recently manifested in Ecuador, the government of
which struggles to contain the eruption of one of the most violent forms
of criminal terrorism the world has seen in years.

Fourth are ongoing problems with environmental change, including that
caused by the detrimental effects of current wars, problems with fresh
water and sufficient food supply of the ever-growing world population as
well as uncontrolled cross-border migration.

Finally, but not least, the growing values-driven divide between the
west and the global south risks the emergence of the post-rules-based
order world.

Avoiding a nuclear escalation

Of all the challenges above, [the]{.underline} **[most immediate
concern]{.underline}** [this year is the]{.underline} **[risk
of]{.underline}** ongoing **[wars]{.underline}** in Ukraine and Gaza
[spreading beyond]{.underline} their current [battle zones, dragging
in]{.underline} **[more]{.underline}** [actors, and rising]{.underline}
**[nuclear escalations]{.underline}**.

In Ukraine, the prevailing fear is of Russia's strategic offensive,
which may see further losses to the besieged country's territories.

That may force Volodymyr Zelensky's government to enter into difficult
political negotiations with Vladimir Putin, an option that is still
being rejected by both sides.

The alternative is Ukraine's political and military defeat in the longer
run, unless NATO is willing to intervene militarily by sending its own
forces to defend central and western parts of the country.

That in turn [would]{.underline} **[seriously]{.underline}** [escalate
the chances of a]{.underline} **[conventional conflict]{.underline}**
[transitioning into a]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**
[phase]{.underline}.

In the Middle East, there is the ongoing risk of a war between Hamas and
Israel broadening to Lebanon and beyond, eventually drawing in more
players from the region.

In a worst-case scenario, Israel's war against Palestinian based
terrorist and extremist groups could transition into yet another
Arab-Israeli war, eventually culminating into a war between Israel and
the Muslim world.

That [scenario]{.underline} too [carries]{.underline}
**[risks]{.underline}** [of a]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**
[escalation]{.underline}.

The [extent of US **dollar** dominance]{.underline} and its preservation
[has **become** a principal **theater** for the great **power** struggle
between the **U**nited **S**tates, **China**, and
**Russia**]{.underline}---[placing]{.underline} the [**future** of
**liberal international order** in the balance]{.underline}. The dollar
is the [only truly global currency]{.underline} in the world, and is
widely used for [**transactions**, pricing, settlement, and
**investment**]{.underline} by governments and private actors outside
the United States. These roles offer the United States economic,
political, and social privileges. Economically, Americans benefit from
the ease and convenience of transacting in dollars, from seigniorage,
monetary flexibility, and safe-haven benefits in times crisis.
Politically, the [dollar offers the United States]{.underline} a
[non-military instrument]{.underline} of [coercion]{.underline} with
which to police international order. Socially, the United States gains
status and prestige. Preserving the dollar's status as the global
currency is therefore in the United States' interest, and potentially in
other countries' interest.

Dollar dominance refers to the disproportionate use of dollars in the
world economy, a condition which has prevailed during the entire postwar
era. The absolute dominance of the dollar is unlikely to change in
decades to come, though the dollar's relative dominance has receded from
peak levels. Even though the dollar remains dominant, a [relative
**weakening** of the dollar's status]{.underline} is [considered a
**harbinger** of the long-term power shift to]{.underline} the
[**East**, hastening]{.underline} the [**onset** of a **multipolar**
order]{.underline} in which the [United States is less
capable]{.underline} and less influential.

\<\<START CONDENSE\>\>

Assessing dollar dominance The precise meaning of dollar dominance in
this regard remains unsettled. How strong must the dollar be relative to
other currencies used for international purposes for the international
currency system to be characterized by dollar dominance? This question
is rarely tackled head on. The lack of a common focal point makes it
very difficult to determine whether dollar dominance is truly threatened
and how to discern a multipolar currency system if, and when, one comes
to pass. Using metrics over the various functions of an international
currency, for example the reserve currency function, it is possible
quantify dollar dominance according to established criteria---for
instance polarity or systemic concentration. Polarity is a term
traditionally used by international-relations scholars to assess the
international balance of power based on military might. But the concept
is sometimes used to describe the international distribution of economic
power. Polarity is particularly well-suited for characterizing the
international currency system because great-power currency capabilities
can be used to enforce international agreements and police international
order. Strictly speaking, polarity is the number of great powers in the
international system. In a unipolar currency order, one great power
enjoys preponderance and has no close rival. In a bipolar currency
order, two great powers predominate and have distant rivals. And in a
multipolar currency order, more than two great powers wield relatively
equal influence. Yet this still leaves open the question of how to
measure polarity. Over the course of half a century, the dollar's
reserve currency role was strongest in the years following the collapse
of the Bretton Woods dollar standard when President Nixon abandoned the
promise to convert dollar reserves into gold---the 1971 Nixon shock.
Regardless of which measure of dominance is used---polarity or systemic
concentration---the dollar is significantly lower today than it was in
1973. However, the dollar's reserve currency role is stronger than it
was in 1990 when the Cold War ended. In a fifty-year perspective, the
dollar reached a low point at that time, a period otherwise considered
to mark the onset of America's unipolar moment. Clearly, the level of
reserve currency holdings in a single year, or within a limited time
frame, is not a good predictor of US ascendancy or decline in any
broader sense. Point estimates of reserve currency holdings are not a
good predictor of dollar dominance either. That is because the liquidity
creating role, assumed by the issuer of the first international
currency, requires adjustment of expansionary policies, resulting in
cycles of trade deficits when demand for dollar assets is typically high
and deficit adjustment when dollar demand tends to fall. Depending on
the measure used to assess dollar dominance, the most recent downward
dollar cycle began in 2016 (polarity) or 2017 (concentration). According
to both measures, an upward cycle began in 2020 and stabilized despite
the 2022 sanctions against Russia.

\<\<END CONDENSE\>\>

The dollar's many international roles

The dollar's reserve currency role is used synonymously with the
dollar's ability to fulfill the range of currency functions---as medium
of exchange, unit of account, and store of value---for governments and
private actors. This shorthand reflects the view that [governments'
**willingness** to **accumulate** dollar **reserves** is a **condition**
for the **longevity** of the dollar system]{.underline}. For example, in
times of crisis, when dollar shortages occur, private actors rely on
their central banks to supply them with dollar assets, sometimes via
swap lines extended by the Federal Reserve. Private actors' willingness
to use and hold dollars is necessary for the dollar system's reach and
entrenchment, but private entities coexist within a decentralized
system. Their actions are not as consequential as those of official
actors because each single entity typically holds a small slice of
dollar assets. Even the considerable dollar assets held within large
financial institutions consist of deposits by separate entities without
any means or incentives to coordinate actions apart from inadvertently
via the price mechanism. Unlike official actors, private actors' choice
of foreign currency is exclusively an economic decision. Moreover, they
are unlikely to act collectively with the aim of disrupting the system.
The reserve currency role is where the United States has the biggest
lead relative to its nearest currency rival, the euro-zone.

How the dollar became dominant

The dollar rose to the top of the international currency hierarchy after
World War I, superseding the British pound which regained its number one
position in the interwar years before permanently losing currency
primacy to the United States after World War II. After World War I,
devastated European countries began relying on the United States for
loans to rebuild their war-torn economies. The United States gradually
became banker to the world with [**New York** emerging as a **financial
center**]{.underline} on a par with London. The stock market crash of
1929 and the ensuing Great Depression hit the United States hard, and
the international role of the dollar declined between the two world
wars. The [**1944 Bretton Woods** Agreement **created** a dollar-based
**system**]{.underline} in which [**all** currencies were **pegged** to
the **dollar**]{.underline} and the [**dollar** was pegged to **gold**,
convertible]{.underline} at the rate of thirty-five dollars an ounce.
World War II decimated European industry, which the United States helped
rebuild through the Marshall Plan with large-scale investments and
merchandise exports to Europe.

The United States' strong economic lead after the two world wars,
Europe's dependence on the United States to resuscitate its ailing
economies, along with the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement on the
dollar-gold standard created the conditions for dollar dominance. Dollar
primacy continued even as the United States broke away from the system
which established the dollar's prominent role. The Bretton Woods system
capped US trade deficits at levels compatible with the United States'
[ability to liquidate foreign dollar holdings]{.underline} through gold
conversion. When the United States shook off the constraints reflected
by gold conversion, the dollar system did not end. The 1971 Nixon shock
simply decoupled the dollar from gold and replaced the gold constraint
on US trade deficits with inflation and dollar depreciation.

The role of trade and oil

The dollar's international role initially coincided with US trade
surpluses as European countries absorbed American goods. As the European
economies grew, demand for US assets grew, and the trade dynamic was
reversed. US trade deficit pressures started to undermine the Bretton
Woods dollar standard as predicted by the economist Robert D. Triffin.
In his testimony to the US Congress, Triffin pointed to the
[**contradiction** between the United States' **liquidity**
provision]{.underline} and [**confidence** in the
**dollar**.]{.underline} The United States exported dollar assets, which
were held abroad as foreign reserves, creating the liquidity needed to
fuel economic growth. Dollar exports generated foreign investment in the
United States leading to trade deficit pressures. In this case, the
large supply of dollars undermined confidence in the dollar,
particularly the United States' ability to honor dollar conversion into
gold, potentially jeopardizing the dollar standard. On the other hand,
had the United States not accepted to run trade deficits the main source
of international liquidity would run dry, which risked undermining
international economic growth with destabilizing consequences. The
United States' liquidity provision was required for continued growth but
in conflict with the long-term prospects of the dollar's international
role. Triffin predicted the breakdown of the Bretton Woods dollar
system, and the dilemma remains relevant for the relationship between
the United States' liquidity creating role and confidence in the dollar.
In the 1970s, [**oil** and other **commodities** began]{.underline} to
be [**priced** in dollars]{.underline}, creating incentives for official
and [private actors to **settle** payments in dollars]{.underline} and
[therefore **store** value in dollars]{.underline}.

Threats to dollar dominance

The [dollar remains **dominant** due to **economic**
fundamentals]{.underline} and the [**history** of using
dollars]{.underline}, favoring future use [because **everyone** else is
using dollars]{.underline}. Supporting the dollar's international role
are factors such as the [**size** of the US economy]{.underline}, its
[commercial and **financial** markets, the **liquidity**, depth,
**breadth**]{.underline} and openness of US financial markets, the
dollar's [convertibility, **relative stability**]{.underline}, and
[**sound** macroeconomic **policies**]{.underline}. The economic
policies underpinning issuance of the primary international currency has
not been flawless, but the historical record does not need to be perfect
for the historical record to support the dollar's continued use. The
network effects of plugging into the dollar system due to the liquidity,
depth, and breadth of the market for dollars creates an incumbency
advantage, which is hard to overcome. In the absence of major economic
or geopolitical upheaval, [**inertia** disincentivizes a major
switch]{.underline} to alternative currencies. Political factors could
also impinge on the dollar's role. For example, strong political
institutions and property rights protection contribute to shoring up
confidence in the US economy. Security ties to the United States are
also said to have favored dollar use in the early Cold War days. US
sanctions to uphold the liberal international order invite dollar
support from states backing the order. On the flip side, an erosion of
US political institutions, a weakening or reduced need for US security
guarantees, or alternatively a sanctions backlash would likely reduce
dollar support.

Unless political developments within the United States or US foreign
policies radically shake confidence in the United States and access to
dollars, economic factors are more likely to determine the fate of the
dollar system.

US decline

The United States' relative economic decline has been debated for at
least sixty years. In the 1960s, Organski predicted China's inevitable
rise as a systemic leader and noted India's likely emergence as a great
power. In the 1980s, Paul Kennedy famously predicted that the United
States would lose the superpower competition with the Soviet Union due
to military overstretch. And an emphasis on competition in the era of
economic interdependence led to repeated warnings about the United
States' ability to maintain its edge over rising economic powers,
notably Europe and Japan.

The United States has declined relative to other great powers along
various dimensions but remains the absolute strongest power across most
dimensions. China's gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly eighty
percent of US GDP, and its goods imports are roughly equivalent to US
goods imports. However, [**China's** financial markets are **nowhere**
near the size or **sophistication**]{.underline} of US financial markets
and [China's **yuan** accounts for **less** than **three**
percent]{.underline} of [foreign exchange reserves]{.underline}. The
euro area is a closer competitor to the dollar. [Euro area]{.underline}
GDP is approximately [sixty percent of US]{.underline} GDP, goods
imports account for some ninety percent of US goods imports, and euro
area financial markets are both advanced and large. The [euro is the
second strongest]{.underline} reserve currency, accounting for
approximately [twenty percent of foreign exchange]{.underline} reserves
compared to the [dollar's **sixty** percent share]{.underline}.

US domestic economic policies

While the [**dollar** enjoys an **extraordinary** lead]{.underline} over
other international currencies, [it is **not** invincible. **Poor**
domestic **policies**]{.underline} could [**shake** confidence **in**
the **dollar**]{.underline}. Structurally, the United States'
[liquidity-creating role]{.underline}---providing dollar assets to the
rest of the world---and the ability to invest in the United States [can
interact **unfavorably** with]{.underline} low savings in the United
States, resulting in [**large** deficits, **rising** public and/or
private **debt**]{.underline}. Unlike the euro-zone, however, the United
States does not face the prospect of involuntary sovereign default
because the dollar is a convertible sovereign currency. [The recent
**specter** of US **default**]{.underline}, a possibility which [arises
**periodically**, is entirely **voluntary**]{.underline} and [**due** to
a self-imposed **debt ceiling**]{.underline}. In the United States, the
upper bound of the debt limit is rather determined by foreigners'
willingness to hold dollars, at worst resulting in inflation and
depreciation. Although the United States cannot be forced to default,
such an adjustment process may not be benign.

\<\<START CONDENSE\>\>

Geopolitical challenges There have been few deliberate attempts to
unseat the dollar as the first international currency. In the early
twenty-first century, Iraq and Iran discussed switching oil pricing from
dollars to euros with a view to reducing dependence on the dollar
system, a response to US sanctions and interventions in the Middle East.
More recently, an [anti-dollar counter-coalition centered
around]{.underline} the [BRICS]{.underline} countries has
[emerged]{.underline}. The inclusion of China and Russia, and large
emerging economies, presents a more potent challenge to dollar dominance
than in the past. If sanctions, or some other development, leaves other
countries dissatisfied, the counter-coalition could grow and pose a more
acute defiance against the dollar system. [Rising US public
debt,]{.underline} high inflation, and other key developments are
[unfolding in a strategic setting reminiscent of]{.underline} the [Cold
War]{.underline} environment. The most striking parallel is the return
of [great-power rivalries]{.underline} and policymakers' preoccupation
with security concerns, which are taking precedence over economic
efficiency. Fears about economic decoupling, deglobalization, and
fragmentation abound. On the monetary front, the worry is that countries
anticipating US sanctions will move preemptively to reduce their
dependence on the dollar. China and Russia have been especially
energetic in pushing alternative currencies and building a multinational
financial infrastructure for trade and investment in renminbi and
rubles. For example, China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System
(CIPS) acts as a clearing house similar to the US Clearing House
Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). CIPS processes a mere fifteen
thousand transactions per day, amounting to the dollar equivalent of
fifty billion, whereas CHIPS processes twenty-five thousand transactions
per day, with a value exceeding \$1.5 trillion. The CIPS initiative has
nonetheless laid the groundwork to clear and settle more cross-border
exchange in renminbi. When China launches a financial messaging system
capable of working independently from the Society for Worldwide
Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), it will have its own
complete, autonomous architecture for settling cross-border transactions
denominated in its own currency. For its part, Russia has already taken
steps to bypass SWIFT, creating its System for Transfer of Financial
Messages (SPFS) after its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russia's
central bank claims that demand for SPFS has increased significantly
since last year's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the time, however,
the system had only around four hundred users. Still, owing to new
payments infrastructure and various bilateral agreements, pursuing trade
and investment in non-Western currencies has become somewhat easier.
Russia and China have agreed to trade in renminbi; and, reviving the
Cold War-era rupee-ruble mechanism, Russia and India were planning to
trade in their own currencies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, that effort was recently discontinued, with both countries
settling on using the United Arab Emirates' dirham instead. All told,
such use of alternative currencies by third countries remains small.
While the renminbi is being used to settle a Russian investment in a
nuclear-power plant in Bangladesh, other examples are scarce.
Governments are also making plans to move away from pricing oil in
dollars, although the significance of this development is easily
overstated. Oil may be one of the world's leading export products, but
it ultimately accounts for a small share of global trade. More broadly,
because international currencies are, by definition, used by third
countries, adopting a trade or investment partner's currency will not
necessarily raise that currency's international role, even if it does
reduce the greenback's relative role in cases where those transactions
were previously denominated in dollars. Those predicting the end of
dollar hegemony also point to China's own use of bilateral swap lines to
allow foreign central banks to acquire renminbi in exchange for their
own currency. Making renminbi available to foreign governments is a
prerequisite for its use by public and private actors, and the ability
to act as lender of last resort in times of crisis is a key
reserve-currency function. China has also been maneuvering to expand its
institutional footprint, such as by introducing an emergency renminbi
liquidity arrangement under the auspices of the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). Similarly, the basket of currencies underpinning the
International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights (SDR, the IMF's
reserve asset), now includes the renminbi, alongside the dollar, yen,
euro, and pound sterling. And the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China,
and South Africa) have also discussed ways to push back against dollar
hegemony, such as by issuing a joint reserve currency to bypass the
dollar and other major Western currencies (as well as offering an
alternative to SDR). Finally, one of the most eagerly anticipated
technological developments in this area is China's creation of digital
payment alternatives. China's central bank introduced a digital
currency, the e-CNY, in 2016 and offered this payment option to
participants at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. When fully implemented,
the e-CNY will function independently of other payment and
financial-messaging systems. By offering cheaper, faster, and safer
transactions, a Chinese digital currency could make the renminbi more
attractive and therefore more widely accessible and liquid. Promoting
the e-CNY for trade and investment could accelerate renminbi
internationalization.

But [underlying **trade** and investment patterns must change
**before**]{.underline} the [global **currency** hierarchy
**does**]{.underline}. Here, the China-centered Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership, as well as China's Belt and Road Initiative, could
help internationalize the renminbi by multiplying economic interactions
and encouraging renminbi use in third-country trade and investment.
Still, in the [medium term, **renminbi
internationalization**]{.underline} is [likely to **encounter**
substantial **hurdles**, owing to]{.underline} [China's maintenance of
**capital** controls]{.underline} and broader
[**balance**-of-**payments** constraints]{.underline}.

Why [**sanctions** are an **unlikely** tipping point for dollar
dominance]{.underline}

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, geopolitical blowback is widely
seen as threatening dollar dominance. To fully grasp what today's
turbulence means for the dollar system, we must however move beyond the
motivations of countries targeted by sanctions. Many countries benefit
from US currency coercion because they share the core principles behind
US sanctions. Countries supporting sanctions on Russia have strong
geopolitical incentives to continue holding and using dollars for
international reserve and payment purposes. Supporting the dollar
reinforces the constraining impact of the sanctions and helps ensure
their future effectiveness. The economic incentives these governments
previously had to diversify away from traditional currencies,
particularly the US dollar must now be weighed against their
geopolitical incentives to hold dollars. Together, the coalition arrayed
against Russia accounts for more than ninety percent of global currency
reserves, approximately eighty percent of global investment, and sixty
percent of world trade and world economic output. Overcoming that
dominance would be difficult even if every country that has declined to
sanction Russia fell in line behind an organized anti-dollar coalition.
Moreover, countries not participating in sanctions against Russia do not
necessarily disagree with the goals behind them: ending the war in
Ukraine and deterring future territorial aggression. The coalition
behind the sanctions against Russia is broad, wealthy, and militarily
powerful, and its objective of ending Russia's barbarous war is widely
shared, even by those not participating in the sanctions.
[**Geopolitically** induced dollar support]{.underline} is rather
[likely to **stabilize** dollar **holdings**]{.underline}.

Having noted the relationship between sanctions and dollar dominance a
decade ago, I am not suggesting there is no possible scenario in which
sanctions threaten dollar hegemony, simply that the Russia sanctions are
highly unlikely to represent such a tipping point. Sanctions should be
designed to prevent the unipolar currency order from further eroding.
For example, by building broad sanctions coalitions in which
participation is strictly voluntary and without forcing countries to
choose sides. Sanctions can be costly for third parties. Whenever
possible, steps should be taken to alleviate unintended consequences. In
addition, sanctions should be reserved for clear-cut cases in which the
international order is under threat, as in Ukraine, and should not be
used for parochial purposes, as when sanctions were reinstated against
Iran in 2018, even though Iran had not broken the terms of the nuclear
deal, or when the Trump administration imposed overly harsh sanctions on
Cuba. Imposing sanctions to pursue narrow US interests raises legitimate
fears among countries that they could be targeted next, motivating them
to find alternatives to the dollar. [Using **sanctions** to **preserve**
the central elements]{.underline} of the [**liberal** international
**order**]{.underline} is a [goal many **countries** can **subscribe**
to]{.underline}, or at least tolerate, leaving the dollar as their
continued currency of choice.

Other geopolitical drivers

Sanctions risk is not the only geopolitical factor shaping dollar use.
In today's fraught international environment, countries question the
wisdom of system-wide economic interdependence and privilege economic
ties with friends. As security concerns eclipse economic concerns, the
United States and Europe are limiting their economic dependence on
foreign adversaries and pushing to relocate manufacturing and supply
chains to allied nations in what has come to be known as "friend
shoring." Just as countries are beginning to source goods and inputs
from friendly nations, they may very well adopt the currencies of

Globally Dominant\"; New Republic;

Accessed 4-7-2024\]

In early 2016, Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cautioned that the
dollar's dominance as a global currency rested, in part, on the U.S.
government's reluctance to fully weaponize it. If foreign markets and
governments "feel that we will deploy sanctions without sufficient
justification or for inappropriate reasons," he warned, "we should not
be surprised if they look for ways to avoid doing business in the United
States or in U.S. dollars." Lew's case stemmed from the more fundamental
view that the [dollar's international role is]{.underline} "a source of
tremendous strength for our economy, a benefit for U.S. companies and [a
**driver** of U.S. **global leadership**"---in other words, a role
**worth keeping**]{.underline}. This view is emblematic of American
financial governance since the Second World War. U.S. economic analysts,
especially at the Treasury, have jealously guarded the dollar's role and
the many benefits it offers: the ability to run large deficits at low
cost and disproportionate influence over the structure of the global
economy, among others.

[Yet]{.underline} in their recent article in The New Republic, David
[Adler and]{.underline} Daniel [Bessner argue]{.underline} the U.S.
should abandon these advantages. In their view, [the dollar's role has
encouraged]{.underline} American [militarism and should be relinquished
to curb such behavior. Dollar hegemony is not without cost, but to
renounce it would be a **profound mistake**]{.underline}. Adler and
Bessner's [view neglects the sizable economic benefits the dollar's role
confers on the U.S., as well as its possible use as an **antidote** to
**military adventurism**. It ignores the **enormous good** that can be
done with **deficit spending**, much of which has gone to the American
military but could instead **fund progressive programs**. And it elides
the **inability** of the U.S. and its global trading partners to **shift
away** from dollar dominance without **creat**ing **worldwide financial
distress**]{.underline}. Adler and Bessner are right that the U.S. has
misused its privilege, but Washington should not abandon it; rather,
American leaders should seek to transform it.

Generations of American policymakers have been right to protect the
dollar's key currency role for economic reasons. Most notably, [dollar
hegemony **affords** the U.S. the **ability** to run large and prolonged
budget and balance-of-payments **deficits**]{.underline}. The dollar
represents 62 percent of allocated foreign exchange reserves, is used to
invoice and settle roughly half of world trade, and accounts for 42
percent of global payments. [Because governments, banks, and businesses
worldwide **need lots of dollars**, the world market **always stands
ready** to **absorb** new U.S.-dollar-denominated debt without charging
higher interest rates]{.underline}.

Adler and Bessner correctly point out that the rest of the world
considers the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency to be an
"exorbitant privilege," a term coined in the 1960s by then French
Finance Minister Valéry Giscard D'Estaing. The ability to spend beyond
its means has enabled the U.S. to fund its impressive military might,
whether one views that power as the fountainhead of Pax Americana or the
source of illegitimate military adventurism.

But these economic benefits go beyond just deficits. The demand for
dollars also pushes up the dollar's value against other currencies,
enhancing American purchasing power and offering consumers access to
imports on the cheap. The dollar's role also means American firms rarely
need to do business in foreign currencies, reducing transaction costs
and exchange-rate risks.

More broadly, America's central economic role gives it outsize influence
at crucial moments. At the height of the financial crisis that began in
2008, the Federal Reserve was able to inject vital liquidity into the
global financial system by selectively offering dollar swap lines to
trusted foreign central banks. Dollar hegemony enabled the U.S. to act
swiftly, effectively, and on its own terms.

In addition, [the **dollar**'s role offers a **potent alternative to
kinetic military action** as a means of pursuing foreign policy
objectives. The dollar's broad use means access to dollar
liquidity]{.underline}---which in turn requires access to the U.S.
financial system---[is **essential** for foreign governments and
businesses. For foreign banks]{.underline}, especially, [being cut off
from dollar access is essentially a **death sentence**. That **makes
sanctions that do so a powerful tool** in the international
arena]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} 20**[05]{.underline}**, for example, [the U.S. used the
dollar to strike a devastating blow against **North Korea**]{.underline}
without firing a single shot or even formally enacting sanctions. Using
authority provided by Section 311 of the Patriot Act, the Department of
the Treasury crippled Banco Delta Asia, a bank accused of facilitating
illegal activity by the North Korean government, by merely threatening
to cut off its access to the American financial system. Deposit outflows
began within days; within weeks the bank was placed under government
administration to avoid a full collapse. Pyongyang was hit hard, as
other banks ceased their business with it to avoid meeting the same
fate.

[Similarly]{.underline}, though the Trump administration has worked hard
to undo it, [the **J**]{.underline}oint **[C]{.underline}**omprehensive
**[P]{.underline}**lan **[o]{.underline}**f **[A]{.underline}**ction
[with **Iran** to limit the development of **nuclear weapons** was made
possible]{.underline}, in part, [by painful **dollar sanctions** that
**brought Iran to the table**. Far from being a proximate cause of
military conflict, the dollar's central global role has often been used
to **contain adversaries** without **military
intervention**]{.underline}.

Still, skeptics are right to point out that the dollar's role has
indirectly funded American interventionism and that dollar sanctions
have been overused, provoking the ire of American allies. But these
facts suggest we should use our dollar power to forge a more progressive
U.S. order, not abandon the advantage altogether. America's exorbitant
privilege need not fund warships and missiles: The same [low-interest
borrowing could]{.underline} be used to [fund]{.underline} a new
[**universal health care** system]{.underline}, expand access to
[**higher education**, or]{.underline} pursue any number of [large-scale
social policy objectives, including]{.underline} financing **[global
public goods]{.underline}** that **[no other country]{.underline}** or
consortium of countries [is prepared to fund, such as **climate change
mitigation**]{.underline}.

### Won't Pass and No PC

#### Won't pass and no PC -- dozens of sticking points of the bill prove Trump's collapsed PC due to tariff fights and terrible poll numbers

**Stirewalt, The Hill political editor, 5/2/25**

\[Chris, 5/2/25, The Hill, "Whole Hog Politics: How Trump misspent his
political capital", Whole Hog Politics: How Trump misspent his political
capital, accessed 6/12/25\]

[The first 100 days of this Trump administration has had very little to
do with Congress. Except for getting through a wild and wooly bunch of
appointees, there has so far been basically no Trump agenda for
Congress.]{.underline} Having learned his lesson from eight years ago,
Trump sidestepped a fight on spending, kicking the can on a six-month
funding deal. Eight years ago, Trump's grip on his party was weakened;
he obviously feared being branded a deficit spender. This time, the
Freedom Caucus is utterly defanged.

That's evidence of how much political capital Trump had at the outset
with his party. If you can get people who vowed never to support a
continuing resolution to get comfortable with red ink, you've got your
people where you want them.

But [the Trump reboot is not a show about Congress. It is all about the
title character]{.underline}. So the first 100 days were dominated by
the satisfying squeak of Sharpie on paper as Trump fired off executive
action after executive action. Particularly on trade, but also on an
increasingly bellicose stance with the courts, Trump has embraced the
idea of "I alone can fix it" to the almost complete exclusion of
Congress. He believed this was the right course of action since it is
his default mode, but also because all of the patootie smoochers in his
cabinet and in Congress kept telling him how massive, historic and
amazing his 2024 win was. If Trump in 2017 was the dog who caught the
car, in 2025 he is Toonces.

[Trump believed the hype and rather than taking advantage of his
modestly better approval rating at the start of his second term,
proceeded to quickly exhaust it crashing into things.]{.underline} He
concluded his first 100 days worse off than any of his predecessors,
including himself. That's not a huge political problem in the sense that
100 days is an arbitrary and brief measurement. [He has 1,359 days to
get back on the good foot, and success would quickly rally the market
for political capital.]{.underline}

**[Where the real trouble comes in for Trump is that he didn't make
better use of his moment with Congress.]{.underline}**

**[The honeymoon, little as it was, is wrapping up.]{.underline}**
**[The Senate is getting prickly on tariffs. Trump has just jettisoned
one of the Senate GOP's favorites among his senior aides. Elon Musk has
lost his charge. Trump's overall approval has declined nearly 7 points
in just the past month, leaving him nearly 13 points
underwater.]{.underline}**

[And now comes the hard part.]{.underline}

For [four months, congressional Republicans have been delaying the major
fights on the parts of Trump's agenda that will demand their assent.
Trump's 2017 tax cuts are expiring this year, and without action,
Americans will be hit with a massive tax increase in the midst of an
already contracting economy.]{.underline} But the **[reconciliation
package currently stalled in Congress is a lot more than just
maintaining the status quo.]{.underline}** It's the vehicle for border
spending, a military buildup, and Trump hopes, new tax cuts aimed at his
blue-collar and elderly supporters.

Problem is, [Congress has only succeeded in agreeing to eventually hash
it all out, but has done next to none of the actual
hashing.]{.underline} Dozens of ideas are swirling around Capitol Hill,
ranging from a car tax to a tax hike for the wealthy. Lawmakers from
vulnerable blue-state districts want an increase to the state and local
tax deduction. Lawmakers from poor states are freaking out about
potential cuts to Medicaid. It's a real mess.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has impressed friends and foes alike
with his ability to plow through these problems so far, says he wants it
all done in the next three weeks, with the beginning of July as the
possible fallback. Let's say Johnson succeeds --- no sure thing --- what
happens next?

[**The House-passed bill heads over to the Senate and starts rotting
like a jack-o'-lantern left out too long on the porch.** As we saw in
the can-kicking part of this exercise, **the House and the Senate are
miles apart on these questions**. Whatever the House does, if it really
can deliver, will not be passed by acclamation in the Senate. Instead,
the House provisions slapped together to please narrow constituencies in
the lower chamber will start to molder under Senate
scrutiny.]{.underline}

And if they do move slowly, at some point along the way, [Congress will
probably have to vote to raise the federal borrowing limit, an issue
sure to deepen enmity between members and between chambers.]{.underline}

[That's all a long way of saying that while it doesn't seem possible
that congressional Republicans would fail so completely that they
wouldn't be able to extend current rates, it is very much an open
question that they will be able to do much more than that.]{.underline}
And if all Trump has to show for his much-ballyhooed mandate is keeping
things the same, voters are not going to be feeling very golden about
the golden age.

[As Trump tries to unwind the knot of his big, unpopular moves on trade
and deals with a series of setbacks in the courts, **it's becoming
increasingly clear that he didn't put his political capital where it
could grow the most: Congress.**]{.underline}

### Won't Pass

#### Won't pass -- GOP divisions

**Bolton, The Hill writer, 6/10/25**

\[Alexander, 6/10/25, The Hill, "Senate GOP deeply divided over cutting
cost of 'big, beautiful bill'",
<https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5341080-republicans-debate-fiscal-deficit-cuts/>\]

**[Senate Republicans are deeply divided over how to cut the cost of
House-passed legislation]{.underline}** to enact President Trump's
agenda, which Elon [Musk has attacked as a "mountain of disgusting pork"
and fiscal conservatives on Capitol Hill say doesn't do enough to cut
the deficit.]{.underline}

[Facing a jittery bond market and scathing criticism from Musk, GOP
lawmakers have expanded their search for ways to reduce the deficit by
cutting Medicare, the Defense Department and the Federal Reserve ---
areas of the budget that were considered off-limits just a few weeks
ago.]{.underline}

**[But each new proposal is creating new divisions.]{.underline}**

Sen. Josh [Hawley]{.underline} (R-Mo.) [is warning colleagues to steer
clear of cutting Medicare spending, even though proponents of the idea
insist it would be targeted only on "waste, fraud and
abuse."]{.underline}

["I don't like this idea of fiddling with Medicare at all,"]{.underline}
Hawley said. ["I think it's a bad idea. We should not do that. I've
counseled against it."]{.underline}

["How about instead we cap the price \[Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services\] is paying for prescription drugs? Why touch
Medicare?"]{.underline} he asked.

[Other Republicans want to look at Medicare Advantage plans provided by
private insurance companies as an alternative to traditional Medicare.
They say "fly-by-night" health care providers are abusing the program
and bilking the federal government.]{.underline}

Sen. Roger [Marshall]{.underline} (R-Kan.) [said lawmakers are
discussing a proposal sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that could
save up to \$275 billion by cracking down on insurance companies that
overcharge Medicare Advantage.]{.underline}

["No one is more concerned about our national debt than I am. I would
like to cut more money on this bill. If it was up to me, we would be
going from \$7 trillion a year to \$6.5 trillion,"]{.underline} Marshall
said, proposing a half-trillion dollars in deficit reduction over the
next decade.

**[Some Republicans are also calling for a closer look at defense
spending, arguing the Pentagon needs to see its budget shrink along with
the rest of government.]{.underline}**

While the House-passed bill includes \$150 billion in new funding for
the Defense Department for new programs, such as Trump's "Golden Dome"
missile defense shield, [fiscal conservatives say there's a lot of bloat
in the defense budget that should be eliminated.]{.underline}

Sen. Rand [Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.) **[says defense hawks have a
"hidden agenda" to use Trump's big, beautiful bill to pump up military
spending beyond what the nation could afford.]{.underline}**

"It's a frustration for those of us who think it ought to be about
fiscal restraint and/or cutting taxes, or both. It ends up becoming a
spending bill, and the spending is \$150 billion on top of \[what\] they
were already increasing the military" in the regular appropriations
process, he said.

["If you're fiscally conservative, you have to be fiscally conservative
everywhere. You can't be for blowing the budget out on the military," he
argued.]{.underline}

Marshall says he would also support military spending cuts.

["I'm one of the few Republicans that thinks that defense has more than
enough money," he said.]{.underline}

But cuts to the Pentagon's budget would face strong pushback from Senate
Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Defense
Appropriations Committee Chair Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who argue
Trump's defense budget is inadequate.

Wicker earlier this year called for \$175 billion in new defense funding
to be included in the reconciliation package but later relented to \$150
billion, which he says is the minimum needed.

McConnell is expected to press Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about
Trump's defense appropriations request Tuesday.

[Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proposed stopping interest payments to
banks that deposit cash at the Federal Reserve, which he says would save
\$1 trillion over the next decade.]{.underline}

**[But that proposal is already facing a backlash from the banking
industry, which has come to depend on the payments as a steady cash
flow.]{.underline}**

Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. are warning that eliminating
interest payments would create turmoil in the financial markets and
predict the proposal isn't going anywhere, according to Bloomberg News.

[Proposals in the House-passed bill to cut nearly \$800 billion in
Medicaid spending and \$267 billion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) spending are running into objections from Sens. Susan
Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Jerry Moran
(R-Kan.).]{.underline}

[So are provisions to terminate renewable energy tax breaks that could
strand tens of billions of dollars in investments to Republican
states]{.underline}, such as West Virginia, where the Appalachian
Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub is in danger of losing funds if construction
isn't underway before the end of the year.

Sens. Thom [Tillis]{.underline} (R-N.C.), John [Curtis]{.underline}
(R-Utah) [and]{.underline} Shelley Moore [Capito]{.underline} (R-W.Va.)
**[are sounding the alarm over the immediate phase-out of clean energy
tax breaks]{.underline}**, which they warn would disrupt their state
economies and cost jobs.

On the other side of the argument are conservatives such as Sen. Mike
[Lee]{.underline} (R-Utah), [who say the bill doesn't go far enough to
cut off Medicaid benefits to immigrants in the country illegally, and
Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who wants to immediately repeal the
climate-oriented tax breaks enacted by Biden's Inflation Reduction
Act.]{.underline}

"We're talking about Medicaid, we're talking about EITC, earned income
tax credit, child tax credit, and eligibility for claiming the benefits
of dependents for income tax purposes. Those things should be benefits
available to citizens and lawful permanent residents and not others, not
illegal migrants," Lee told The Hill.

Lee says the House bill doesn't completely shut off federal benefits to
migrants who are living illegally and declared "that's the problem."

Scott, meanwhile, says subsidies for clean energy programs need to be
cut off promptly to help reduce the deficit.

"We got a fiscal crisis," he said. "We have to balance our budget.

"We should completely eliminate the Green New Deal, that's No. 1," he
declared.

#### Won't pass -- impossible to bridge the gap between GOP factions

**Jalonick, Fortune Magazine writer, 6/9/25**

\[Mary Clare, The AP, Fortune Magazine,"Republican senators want to make
changes to Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill'. Here are the competing
groups",
<https://fortune.com/2025/06/09/republican-senators-changes-trump-big-beautiful-bill-competing-groups/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

[The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald
Trump's sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But **getting it
on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big
decisions, and soon.**]{.underline}

**[Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the
legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the
impact on the deficit.]{.underline}** To push the bill to passage,
Senate Majority Leader John [Thune]{.underline} of South Dakota [and
other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both
ends of their conference --- and that can still satisfy the House, which
passed the bill last month by only one vote.]{.underline}

[A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to
convince as they work to push Trump's "big, beautiful" bill toward a
Senate vote:]{.underline}

**[Rural state lawmakers]{.underline}**

Every [Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency
--- and some of their states are among the most rural in the
country.]{.underline} Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on
Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the
changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities
that are already struggling.

[Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some
states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid
programs.]{.underline} The extra tax often leads to higher payments from
the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows
states to inflate their budgets. [Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and
several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt
rural hospitals, in particular.]{.underline}

["Hospitals will close," Hawley said last month. "It's that simple. And
that pattern will replicate in states across the country."]{.underline}

Alabama Sen. Tommy [Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his
state are "the money we use for Medicaid."]{.underline}

**["You start cutting that out, we've got big problems,"]{.underline}**
Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes "might lose some folks."

At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a
House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state
and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally
benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York
and California.

The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to
oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. "I think
there's going to have to be some adjustment" on the SALT provision,
Thune said Wednesday, noting that "senators are just in a very different
place" from the House.

**[Former (and maybe future) governors]{.underline}**

The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp
costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate,
in particular, worried.

West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight
years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many
aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid
and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants
who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud.
"There's real savings there," Justice said. "But then we ought to stop."

["We're on our way to cannibalizing ourselves," Justice said. **"We
don't want to hurt kids and hurt our families."**]{.underline}

The provision stirring the most unease would shift 5% of administrative
costs to the state for administering food stamps --- known as the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States that have
high error rates in the program would have to take on an even higher
percentage of federal costs.

[North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators
are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some
**"incentive-oriented ideas"** instead of a penalty for the high error
rates.]{.underline}

"We don't know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some
of this yet," Hoeven said.

[Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the
program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.]{.underline}

"I know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can't start a
federal program and then say, 'Oh, let's, let's send it back to the
states and let them take a big hunk of it,'" Tuberville said. "I mean,
that's not the way we do it."

**[The moderates]{.underline}**

[Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill,
including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both
have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other
things.]{.underline}

[Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her
state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable
Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off
Medicaid.]{.underline}

Last month, [Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not
negatively impacted by the bill, "so we're looking at it through that
lens for both Medicaid and on energy."]{.underline}

Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah
and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that
would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators
argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and
could raise prices for consumers.

**[The right flank]{.underline}**

Sens. Rand [Paul]{.underline} of Kentucky, Ron [Johnson]{.underline} of
Wisconsin, Mike [Lee]{.underline} of Utah and Rick [Scott]{.underline}
of Florida **[have argued the legislation does not save enough money and
threatened to vote against it.]{.underline}**

Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he
won't vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling --- a key priority for
GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise
the nation's debt limit by \$4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay
the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to
be raised by the middle of July.

Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled
in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending
over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting
between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.

After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill
needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the
recognition that he needed to be "more positive" as Trump exerts
political pressure on Republicans to pass it.

"We're a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I
recognize that's going to take time," Johnson said. "The truth is, there
are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want
it to succeed."

#### Won't pass -- far-right angst and disagreement between chambers

**Bolton, The Hill writer, 6/5/25**

\[Alexander, 6/5/25, The Hill, "Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' losing
momentum in Senate",
<https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5333625-trump-big-beautiful-bill-senate-opposition/>\]

[The sprawling bill to enact President Trump's "big, beautiful" agenda
is losing momentum in the Senate in the face of blistering attacks from
Elon Musk and outspoken opposition from conservatives.]{.underline}

Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike [Crapo]{.underline} (R-Idaho)
[warned colleagues at a special conference meeting Wednesday afternoon
that there are two likely "no" votes against the bill within the Senate
GOP conference, which means just one more defection would threaten to
derail the legislation, according to a senator who attended the
meeting.]{.underline}

[**"Crapo just said, 'I think \[there\] are two of us who are pretty
definite no's,' which means we can't lose anybody else,"** the source
said.]{.underline}

Crapo did not name names, but colleagues assumed he was talking about
conservative Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).

[Paul says he will vote against the bill because it includes language to
raise the debt ceiling by \$4 trillion, extending the federal
government's borrowing authority past the 2026 midterm
election.]{.underline}

Johnson, meanwhile, has called for Senate GOP colleagues to scrap the
House-passed bill and move a smaller measure that would focus on
extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, securing the border and banking on
the spending cuts identified by House committee chairs.

**["What I am rock-solid on is that I can't accept this as the new
normal,"]{.underline}** he said of projections that the annual federal
deficit will reach \$2.2 trillion in 2025 and grow to \$2.7 trillion by
2035.

**["We have our chance to reverse this,"]{.underline}** he said of
growing deficits. "**[I will not be responsible for continuing
this."]{.underline}**

Paul and Johnson are stepping up their criticism of the bill just as
Musk is urging lawmakers to "KILL" the legislation, warning it will blow
up the deficit.

["Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT
ok! KILL the BILL," Musk posted on his social platform X.]{.underline}

The Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday that the 1,116-page
bill passed by the House will add \$2.4 trillion to the deficit over the
next decade.

Trump has set a July 4 deadline for Congress to get the bill to his
desk. But [some GOP lawmakers say that's looking increasingly unlikely
because of a battle between Republican senators over cuts to Medicaid,
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the repeal of
renewable energy tax incentives.]{.underline}

**["It won't happen," Johnson said.]{.underline}**

"The sooner President Trump recognizes the reality of the situation, the
sooner we can work on a smaller version of the bill, do the things that
have to be done: Extend current tax law, increase the debt ceiling,
provide border funding," he said.

He said the package could include spending cuts already passed by the
House, such as a proposal to reduce federal subsidies to Medicaid by
\$698 billion and reduce SNAP spending by \$267 billion.

The expectation that Paul and Johnson will vote against the bill could
give more leverage to Republicans who want to make other changes,
further delaying the effort. Those moderates include Sens. Susan Collins
(R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Jerry
Moran (R-Kan.), who are warning against Medicaid spending cuts that
would affect benefits.

Senate Republicans control 53 seats, which means they could only afford
three defections and still pass the bill.

[Collins, Murkowski, Hawley and Moran say they are closely following the
proposed reforms to Medicaid.]{.underline}

["I am evaluating those provisions,"]{.underline} Collins said of the
changes to Medicaid.

**[She said it's difficult to fully assess the bill until the Senate
parliamentarian weighs in on what policy changes can remain in the
legislation and which need to be stripped out for it to qualify for
fast-track consideration on the floor.]{.underline}**

She said some of the most controversial provisions "may fall out."

"We still don't know exactly what we're looking at," she said.

Collins, who is up for reelection in a state that former Vice President
Kamala Harris carried in the 2024 election, said she's concerned about
changes to the SNAP program that would require Maine to shoulder more of
its costs.

[She said the bill "switches a lot of the administrative costs" for SNAP
"onto the state."]{.underline}

Murkowski said it will be "hard" to meet Trump's deadline of passing the
bill by July 4, noting that even after Republican senators reach a deal,
many of the provisions will need to be vetted by the Senate
parliamentarian.

Moran said he's "waiting for where we end up in the Ag \[Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry\] Committee" on reforms to SNAP.

"What we do will be different from the House. I'm analyzing and
participating in the discussion," he said.

[He said the negotiations over the nutrition program for low-income
Americans are "taking time."]{.underline}

Republicans at a special meeting Wednesday afternoon discussed expanding
their search for savings to Medicaid, despite Trump's warning to House
lawmakers last month not to "f‑‑‑ with Medicaid."

And, notably, they raised the possibility of changes to Medicare.

"There's a legitimate debate about, 'Can we do more with Medicaid? Are
we doing too much with Medicaid? How much waste, fraud and abuse is
there in Medicare? Why don't we go after that?' I think we should," Sen.
Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said after meeting with colleagues to discuss the
bill.

Cramer said senators talked about also examining waste, fraud and abuse
in Medicare to further reduce future deficits.

"There was a lot of presentation and then debate, people throwing out
other ideas, like, 'What about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare?'" he
said.

But tackling waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare would be a
time-consuming task and likely generate a lot of anxiety among GOP
senators who are balking at cuts to Medicaid that they worry could
impact benefits.

"Some people are making that case, other people are wringing their
hands," Cramer said of the internal debate.

Congress to pass the debt ceiling]{.underline}** as part of a funding

**Palmeri 24** -- politics reporter at Puck interviewing Trumps's former
White House political director Bill Stepien.

Tara Palmeri and Bill Stepien, December 19 2024, "How to Spend It:
Political Capital Edition," Puck News,
https://puck.news/why-does-trump-never-seem-to-run-out-of-political-capital/

Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[heading into
his]{.underline}** second **[presidency]{.underline}** [at]{.underline}
**[the height of his political powers]{.underline}**, [a reality
evidenced]{.underline} once again this week [after he sent Capitol Hill
into a tizzy]{.underline} by **[nuking]{.underline}** Mike **[Johnson's
stop-gap bill]{.underline}**. Of course, earlier today, he subsequently
endorsed Johnson's refurbished and slimmed-down C.R. plan---but the
initial episode was instructive in that, despite potentially sending the
government into a shutdown**[, he somehow looked like a renegade hero
within parts of his party.]{.underline}**

Anyway, the other side of this narrative is that Trump is a term-locked
president (at least if you're going by the Constitution), and history
indicates that his party will almost certainly lose the House in the
midterms. This gives him, realistically, about 18 months to spend his
political capital. And no one knows more about political capital---and
Trump's unique relationship to it---than his former White House
political director Bill Stepien.

During Trump's first term, Stepien fed the president polling information
on his legislative agenda and, especially, on midterm races---even if
Trump often followed his own gut instincts. Stepien recently came on my
podcast, Somebody's Gotta Win, to talk about Trump's unusual
relationship with political capital, how that will dictate the
legislative fights ahead, and which cabinet appointments he thinks Trump
will actually fight for. Plus, in light of his lawsuit against Iowa's
Ann Selzer, we also discussed his relationship with pollsters. This
excerpt has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Peak Trump

Tara Palmeri: What does a political director do inside the White House?

Bill Stepien: In most White Houses, there's a focus on helping guide the
legislative agenda based on polling data and public sentiment. In a
Trump White House, it's quite different, as you might imagine. There's a
constant focus on races, candidates, and elections. My first two years
with the president as political director were spent just feeding
information to him---not putting a finger on the scale of, "Sir, you
should do this." People call him and talk about how great they are, or
talk about how great their guy or gal is, without providing a full
story. My job, as I saw it, was to provide a full political story of a
race and give a full picture, so we could have our eyes wide open on
whatever political decisions he sought to make.

Many things are different eight years later. Most notably, [his
political strength is]{.underline} **[much more sizable]{.underline}**.
Now, [you have]{.underline} **[people beating down the
door]{.underline}** [because]{.underline} **[he's at the height of his
power]{.underline}**. At any point, we would have died to have the poll
numbers and strength that he has right now.

Trump's down-ballot endorsements have had a spotty record---and he's
done some unusual ones. For instance, in the '22 Missouri Senate
primary, he offered a kind of double endorsement to both Eric Schmitt
and the scandal-plagued former governor Eric Greitens, and he's done
this more than once. Usually, an endorsement is a golden ticket, but
Trump doesn't look at political capital that way.

I think people oftentimes have a misguided view of the kind of person he
actually is. At the end of the day, he's a people pleaser. He wants to
make people happy. He wants to help people. He wants people to like him,
and he wants to like people. The double-endorsement thing isn't
something I'd seen before, but it's in line with him wanting to please
and to help. That's an example of him doing things his own way, for
sure.

I think there are different ways to view political capital. Someone I
used to work with would often say that you can obtain political capital
and keep it in your desk drawer to save and use for a later date---or
you can use it and actually expend it for something you want or need.
**[Trump views political capital]{.underline}** in the latter category.
**[He gets it. He uses it.]{.underline}** [And]{.underline} [**unlike
anyone I've seen before**,]{.underline} **[he can get
more]{.underline}**. [I'm not sure]{.underline} **[anyone has really
seen an unending supply of political capital like Trump
has]{.underline}**, and I always laughed when I was in the White House
and read stories about how he'd be enraged when one of his endorsees
lost a race. He sees these things as wins and losses. He's very black
and white in how he views these races and his decisions.

And [that]{.underline} **[extends to cabinet nominees]{.underline}**,
**[to legislation]{.underline}**, **[to basically anything he
wants]{.underline}**. It feels like [everybody else is playing political
chess]{.underline}, and **[he's just like, Whatever...]{.underline}**

He believes---and he's right---that **[with a tweet]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[a press conference]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[news media soaks it up]{.underline}**. [I don't think he
worries]{.underline} too much [about a bad news cycle]{.underline},
because **[it's only a matter of hours]{.underline}**, not days or weeks
**[with this guy.]{.underline}** [He's using his levers of
influence]{.underline} to negotiate, to push around, **[to get people to
sit up in their chairs]{.underline}**. [That's]{.underline} **[very
different from what we're used to from the person sitting in that
office]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} **[this is the
guy.]{.underline}**

### PC Low

#### Tariffs [crush]{.underline} support for the agenda.

tariffs.\" NBC News. 4-3-2025.

[The **fallout** from President Donald **Trump\'s** aggressive **new
tariffs** has spurred **Congress** into **action**]{.underline}, [with a
**growing number** of **Republicans** **joining Democrats** to express
interest in using their power to restrain him.]{.underline}

[After the GOP-led Senate **delivered a rare rebuke** to Trump on
Wednesday]{.underline} by voting to undo his tariffs on Canada,
[lawmakers in both chambers are weighing additional **steps** to **rein
him in**]{.underline}. [**Senators** are **eyeing other mechanisms** to
rescind Trump's existing **tariffs** while limiting his ability to
impose new ones]{.underline}. And Democrats in the House are exploring
ways to force a vote to revoke Canadian tariffs, putting out feelers to
attract support from Republicans.

These efforts have a high bar for success as any resolution to undo
Trump's tariffs, or new law affecting his powers, would have to get
around a presidential veto. But [the level of **support** in
**Congress** could affect the **president's political calculus** around
using taxes on imports to the U.S. as a centerpiece of his

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., on Thursday [that would reassert **Congress\'

#### Trump's zapped his political capital

**Lewis, columnist featured in the Hill, 3/6/25**

\[Matt K. Lewis, The Hill, "Trump may have already planted the seeds of
his political collapse",
<https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/5178643-trump-may-have-already-planted-the-seeds-of-his-political-collapse/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

Over the last six weeks, President [Trump has been spending political
capital like a drunk at a casino who insists he's got "a
system."]{.underline} If history is any predictor, **[his second term
trajectory may already be set --- right off a cliff, pedal to the
floor.]{.underline}**

Too soon to say that? Consider former President Joe Biden, who, in his
first weeks in office, reversed Trump's border policies and unleashed
another flood of pandemic relief cash. These moves ultimately helped
create his two biggest political headaches: a migrant crisis and runaway
inflation so bad that even Dollar Tree had to raise its prices.

Then [Biden made it worse by shrugging the problems off. Immigration,
his administration argued, was "cyclical," and inflation was merely
"transitory." Neither explanation turned out to be accurate. His
approval ratings tanked immediately upon his disastrous Afghanistan
withdrawal and never recovered.]{.underline}

Now it's Trump's turn to step on a rake. **[His approval ratings just
went underwater, meaning he hit this particular milestone even faster
than Biden.]{.underline}** According to a new Ipsos poll, [three in five
Americans think the cost of living --- you know, the issue that likely
won Trump the 2024 election --- **is "going in the wrong
direction."**]{.underline}

As you might recall, Trump promised to bring down food prices on day
one. [Well, here we are, and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is
telling the public to deal with high egg prices by raising their own
chickens.]{.underline}

I understand the appeal. Raising chickens --- at least in a world
without bird flu --- might sound charming, and I bet many
environmentally conscious liberals would find it quite nostalgic. But
for most urban and suburban Americans, this is like the secretary of
transportation suggesting we tackle rising gas prices by riding horses
to work.

If a Democrat had said anything this absurd, Fox News would be hosting
an emergency town hall titled "Biden's Barnyard Blunder: The War on Your
Wallet." But somehow, this little nugget of genius has barely
registered. Maybe people are too busy choosing between a carton of eggs
and keeping the lights on.

Meanwhile, [Trump seems hell-bent on seeing just how much economic
misery voters can stomach. His latest stroke of brilliance? Slapping
tariffs on Canada and Mexico --- because nothing fixes inflation quite
like boosting prices.]{.underline}

Planning to build a house? Brace yourself for soaring lumber costs. And
in case that wasn't enough, his mass deportation plan threatens to gut
the construction workforce, sending labor costs through the roof. It's a
perfect one-two punch: fewer workers, pricier materials and a housing
market already on life support.

Don't worry, though --- rather than acknowledge the flawed approach,
Republicans are already laying the groundwork for the inevitable fallout
of Trump's policies by claiming that Americans are willing to suffer
high prices for Trump.

Right. Keep telling yourselves that.

Speaking of scams, Trump just announced something called a "strategic
crypto reserve." I don't know what that is, but I do know if you put
"crypto" and "Trump" in the same sentence, somebody is getting fleeced.
And it ain't him or his fat-cat friends in the tech industry.

This brings us to Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.
On paper, cutting waste sounds great. In reality? A foreign-born
billionaire with a ketamine habit and a collection of surprise baby
mamas who is firing American workers en masse is the kind of thing that
plays terribly --- especially when some of the laid-off employees are
Trump voters who somehow believed he would only go after other people.

That's right. It turns out that the so-called "deep state" includes
regular folks, many of them military veterans, who don't love being laid
off by a billionaire space cadet or one of his Gen Z minions.

[Then there's the looming foreign policy catastrophe: Trump has made an
art form of alienating allies, but his decision to pause military aid
and intelligence sharing for Ukraine could have severe consequences ---
like, say, Russia steamrolling right over Ukraine.]{.underline}

[A majority of Americans, per Ipsos, actually support Ukraine fighting
back with U.S. weapons. So Trump starts off in a minority position, and
that's before his policies risk pushing Ukraine toward a very public
collapse (a scenario one can only hope doesn't unfold).]{.underline}

[If Ukraine falls and the headlines are dominated by reports of Russian
war crimes and images of tanks rolling into Kyiv, Trump's already
fraught position could unravel.]{.underline}

**[In short, Trump is charging ahead like a man convinced he has an
ironclad mandate. He's making the kind of big, flashy moves that
typically blow up in spectacular manner. After all, those who don't
learn from history are doomed to repeat it.]{.underline}**

He has slipped out of tight spots many times before, so maybe he'll pull
it off again.

**[Or maybe, just maybe, his bill is finally coming due.]{.underline}**

### Space/Icebreakers -- Link Turn - Plan Popular

#### Plan's popular -- it's a bipartisan response to Chinese development and exploration of the Arctic

**Tatlow, Newsweek senior reporter, 24**

\[Didi Kirsten, 10/17/24, Newsweek, "Exclusive: Act on \'Problematic\'
Chinese Arctic Research, US Officials Urged",
<https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-lawmakers-letter-us-state-defense-department-china-military-arctic-research-1969618>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

[U.S. lawmakers from **both sides of the aisle have asked the government
to do more to address scientific research by China in the territory of
America\'s Arctic allies that has potential military** applications,
Newsweek has learned.]{.underline}

In a letter sent on Wednesday to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, [a bipartisan congressional committee
said the People\'s Republic of China was seeking influence and access in
the strategically important Arctic region, and that it was expanding its
\"dual-use\"---mixed military and civilian---research, including in NATO
allies Norway and Iceland, in **ways that may challenge U.S.
security.**]{.underline}

Newsweek reported in July that [a Chinese institute in Svalbard
archipelago in the Norwegian Arctic was carrying out potential dual-use
research including in the areas of radar and missile tracking, that the
institute was using a name that masked its role in China\'s military
industry, and that it was undertaking classified research and working
with the Chinese People\'s Liberation Army (PLA).]{.underline}

[\"In recent years, the PRC has increased its effort to seek access to
and exert influence in the Arctic, including expanding dual
civil-military research efforts in the region,\"]{.underline} says the
letter sent by the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party
and seen exclusively by Newsweek.

**[\"The Arctic is critical to U.S. national security interests and the
defense of our homeland, and we must work with our allies to preserve
our defense treaty commitments,\"]{.underline}** the committee, chaired
by Reps. John Moolenaar (R-MI) and ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi
(D-IL), said.

[Norway and Iceland are both NATO allies. Iceland has no standing
army---the United States is responsible for its defense.]{.underline}

[The request to act on what the committee called \"problematic\"
research by China comes amid growing geopolitical competition between
Beijing and Washington.]{.underline} China has said it seeks to match or
outdo the U.S. and its allies in all spheres, including the economy and
the military, by 2049, the centennial of the 1949 Communist revolution.

### Link Turn -- Space

#### Space cooperation with allies for deterrence and readiness purposes is [BIPARTISAN]{.underline} -- the plan's popular!

**Erwin, SpaceNews writer, 6/5/25**

\[Sandra, "Senators unveil bipartisan bill to boost space cooperation
with Indo-Pacific allies",
<https://spacenews.com/senators-unveil-bipartisan-bill-to-boost-space-cooperation-with-indo-pacific-allies/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

WASHINGTON --- [In a new sign of concern over China and Russia's space
activities, two senators unveiled bipartisan legislation June 5 to
deepen military space cooperation between the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific
allies.]{.underline}

Sen. Michael [Bennet]{.underline} (D-Colo.), a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, [and]{.underline} Sen. Kevin
[Cramer]{.underline} (R-N.D.), who sits on the Armed Services Committee,
[introduced the Quad Space Act, a bill aimed at strengthening strategic
coordination in space among the United States, Australia, India, and
Japan --- the four nations of the informal Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue, or "Quad."]{.underline}

["As China and Russia rapidly develop dangerous space capabilities and
behave recklessly in space,"]{.underline} Bennet said in a statement,
["the United States must bolster cooperation with our Quad partners to
ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific."]{.underline}

[The Quad Space Act would direct the Secretary of Defense to begin talks
with the other Quad governments to identify shared security priorities
in space --- ranging from space situational awareness to industrial
policy --- and to report back to Congress with a roadmap for deeper
coordination.]{.underline}

[Though the bill does not allocate funding or authorize new programs,
**its backers hope to attach it as an item of special interest in the
2026 National Defense Authorization Act.**]{.underline}

[**Cramer framed the legislation as a strategic counterweight to growing
adversarial threats**: "Maintaining space dominance is vital to
protecting the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. The
Quad Space Act protects our interests by deepening space cooperation
with trusted partners."]{.underline}

The Quad's expanding orbit

The Quad --- originally formed as a disaster-response partnership in the
aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami --- has evolved over the past
two decades into a cornerstone of U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific.
Revived under the Trump administration in 2017 and elevated to the
leaders' level by the Biden administration, the Quad now spans a wide
range of policy areas, including public health, climate resilience,
critical technologies, and maritime security.

Space cooperation entered the Quad's agenda in 2021, when the group
agreed to share satellite data to improve climate monitoring and
disaster preparedness. **[The new legislation aims to elevate those
largely civil and commercial initiatives into a more explicit military
and strategic framework.]{.underline}**

[U.S. officials have warned of China's development of direct-ascent
anti-satellite missiles and co-orbital systems that could be used to
disable or destroy satellites. Russia, too, has drawn alarm from recent
tests and a potential nuclear space weapon that U.S. intelligence
believes it may be pursuing. **The Space Force and U.S. Space Command
have called for more resilient architectures and closer coordination
with allies.**]{.underline}

### Link Turn -- Icebreakers Popular

new shipbuilding investments, **Trump** staffer **can, within weeks,
chalk up some big cost-cutting and capability-boosting wins.** Public
confidence from quick ICE Pact-driven wins will have wider

takes on other, more ambitious ventures.]{.underline}

**[Icebreakers are an easy win. They're not controversial. Both parties

Coast Guard's icebreaker program and want to build a bigger Polar fleet.

[that's fine]{.underline}: **[his base voters]{.underline}** who

#### Especially because he doesn't care if he's unpopular.

**Kilgore 25** -- political columnist for Intelligencer since 2015.

Ed Kilgore, January 12 2025, "Does Trump Feel the Need to Remain
Popular?" New York Magazine,
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/does-trump-feel-the-need-to-remain-popular.html

Trump does, however, have some control over how much popularity he is
willing to lose. Like anyone who becomes president with some political
capital and the ready means to use it (i.e., controlling Congress as
well as the White House, and having a lot of friends on the U.S. Supreme
Court too), the 47th president will have to decide whether to take some
risks on policies that are very likely to reduce his popularity or,
instead, play to the galleries. To put it even more simply, [he can cash
in some chips on stuff he wants]{.underline} to do **[that could offend
or even shock some of the people]{.underline}** who voted for him
[or]{.underline} **[keep building his stash for the
future]{.underline}**. [Given Trump's]{.underline} almost **[unlimited
control over his troops]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[Washington]{.underline}**, [he can]{.underline} probably [go in
either direction]{.underline}, but that choice of direction could have
an enormous impact on those of us who would greatly prefer a less
ambitious MAGA agenda.

There are a lot of reasons [Trump]{.underline} **[may not care if he
remains popular]{.underline}** [while]{.underline} **[fulfilling his
presidential goals]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} **[is the final
presidential term of a 78-year-old man]{.underline}**; for him, the
future really is right now. Yes, forcing unpopular measures through
Congress might endanger the fragile Republican control of the House in
the 2026 midterms. But history indicates it's very likely [Democrats
will flip the House]{.underline} **[no matter what Republicans
do]{.underline}**, and let's face it: [The long-range future of the
Republican Party]{.underline} **[may not be of great interest to the
president-elect]{.underline}**. Even after being nominated as its
presidential candidate three straight times while gradually grinding
down intraparty opposition to a fine dust, Trump still acts suspiciously
toward his party's Establishment and clearly views it as a vehicle
rather than a cause. This is more speculative, but given his personality
profile [the 47th president may even prefer,]{.underline} or at least
not mind, **[a falloff in the GOP's electoral performance once he's
gone.]{.underline}**

[Add in Trump's impulsiveness]{.underline}, which doesn't suggest
someone for whom delay of gratification comes naturally, [and it
seems]{.underline} **[a "go big, then be gone" attitude is
likely]{.underline}**. Beyond that, [it's unclear how sensitive this man
is to changes in popularity]{.underline}: **[He's never been in an
election he didn't think he'd won]{.underline}**, and [he]{.underline}
**[has a tendency to ignore the polls]{.underline}** that give him news
he doesn't want in favor of the one or two that show support for his
agenda and message always remaining sky-high. [If he did something that
made his popularity crash]{.underline}, **[would he even notice
it,]{.underline}** and if not, would any of the sycophants around him
break the bad --- and possibly fake --- news?

All in all, [the best bet is]{.underline} that Donald **[Trump will
pursue his maximum agenda]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[little
regard to how anyone feels]{.underline}** about it so long as he's
getting it done. [Perhaps Republican officeholders]{.underline} (e.g.,
his vice-president) who have plans beyond 2028 [can talk him into more
prudent conduct]{.underline}; [but in case you haven't
noticed]{.underline}, **[he's stubborn]{.underline}**, and it will
probably take a lot of blatant, in-your-face adversity to change his
course. So **[don't expect it to happen just because it
should.]{.underline}**

## Impact

### Impact Inevitable

#### The bill doesn't raise the debt ceiling enough -- means future fights and brinksmanship inevitable

**Edelberg, former Congressional Budget Office chief economist, 6/9/25**

\[Wendy, 6/9/25, Washington Post, "What the GOP is planning now is even
worse than all those debt ceiling fights",
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/09/budget-debt-ceiling-congress/>\]

[Should Congress enact the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by
the House (formally titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), the tax and
spending policies set in motion over the next decade would require
roughly \$24 trillion in cumulative borrowing, pushing debt as a share
of gross domestic product to about 124 percent. Yet **Congress appears
on track to raise the debt ceiling by only \$4 trillion or perhaps \$5
trillion or, if Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has his way, \$500
billion.**]{.underline} What this means is that **[the
Republican-controlled Congress is deliberately choosing a future for the
country in which tax revenue falls well short of federal spending year
after year --- but in which the treasury is prohibited from making up
the difference by borrowing.]{.underline}**

We all remember decades of arguments over the debt ceiling. We are all
sick of those arguments. Some of us have grown numb to the various
pleas, and many of us hope never to hear about the subject again. But
what [Congress is proposing to]{.underline} do today feels particularly
egregious: **[simultaneously embrace a world that requires extensive
borrowing and prevent that borrowing.]{.underline}** Perhaps they simply
haven't bothered to do the math. More likely, **[they look forward to an
endless series of debt ceiling arguments stretching into the
future]{.underline}**. Either way, **[it marks a new high in budgetary
cynicism.]{.underline}**

### No Impact -- Debt

#### Debt is [irrelevant]{.underline} to the [economic climate]{.underline} and [policymaking]{.underline}.

Georgia. "Why the \$22 trillion national debt doesn't matter -- here's
what you should worry about instead."
https://theconversation.com/why-the-22-trillion-national-debt-doesnt-matter-heres-what-you-should-worry-about-instead-111805

With another round of anxiety-causing debt-ceiling debates likely to
return in the coming months, like other economists, I believe it is
[worth asking whether we should **even care about the size of government
debt**]{.underline}.

Default isn't imminent

[First of all, it's important to note current U.S. debt levels do not
indicate any risk of imminent default]{.underline}.

As long as the U.S. federal government remains an "ongoing concern" --
[fiscal institutions are strong and effective, taxing authority is
maintained and the long-run productive capacity of the nation's economy
is secure -- there is no economic reason to fear default on the nation's
debt]{.underline}. Political reasons, such as debt-ceiling mischief, are
another matter.

To remain solvent and ultimately pay what it owes, the [U.S. Treasury --
which sells notes and bonds to investors to raise money to finance the
budget deficit -- needs only to balance its books over the long run,
rather than over an arbitrary unit of time like a year.]{.underline}

[Historically low interest rates on government debt suggest that bond
market participants agree with this view and are not afraid of a
sovereign debt default in the U.S]{.underline}. Indeed, with these low
rates, **[sufficient economic growth can allow the government to borrow
indefinitely.]{.underline}**

**[Why it's irrelevant]{.underline}**

Although \$22 trillion is a large number, it is [essentially irrelevant
to proper thinking about the economic role of the U.S. government or
about responsible fiscal policy.]{.underline}

Government debt simply reflects the timing of taxes. Higher spending
levels today require more borrowing -- and a larger debt -- as long as
the taxes needed to pay for those expenditures are pushed into the
future.

But [regardless of when taxes are collected, what ultimately matters is
the quantity of the economy's scarce resources the federal government
commands and controls, and how those resources are used,]{.underline}
which essentially depend on the level and composition of government
spending. To paraphrase Milton Friedman, spending is taxing.

In short, [**government debt can be a bad indicator of the stance of
fiscal policy** or its burden on the private sector. The government can
be wildly intrusive in the economy and thus a hindrance to growth and
welfare even if its debt is low.]{.underline} For example, Venezuela's
sovereign debt was only 23 percent of its GDP in 2017, yet its economy
has been in turmoil for several years.

[Or it can effectively manage spending to promote welfare even if its
debt is high. In 1945, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 120
percent]{.underline}, immediately after the government mobilized the
economy to win World War II.

[**High debt should not prevent the government from spending on
worthwhile public endeavors**.]{.underline} And [low debt does not prove
that the level or composition of government spending is
appropriate]{.underline}.

#### Debt is [no problem.]{.underline} The recent spike is [because the economy is strong]{.underline}.

[The U.S. budget deficit is on track to be much bigger this year than
last]{.underline}. Interest rates---a big issue given the level of the
federal debt--have risen notably in recent months. And the U.S. faces
long-run fiscal challenges associated with population aging that will
require tax increases and spending cuts. But **[there is no reason to
panic]{.underline}**. [The rise in the deficit]{.underline} this year
isn't because of a sudden surge in spending---it [**mostly reflects** a
fall in **revenues** from **unusually** high **levels last
year**]{.underline}. As for interest rates, it is too soon to know
whether the recent increases will persist, and if so, why. [If the
recent increase in rates is temporary, or if **reflects** an increase in
**expected GDP growth**, then it will not affect the **sustainability**
of the **federal debt**.]{.underline}

[The deficit over the first 11 months of fiscal year 2023]{.underline}
(from October 2022 to August 2023) [was]{.underline} \$1.5 trillion, [up
\$600 billion from last year]{.underline}. As a share of GDP, the
deficit has increased from around 3.8% in the first 11 months of 2022 to
5.7% this year. (Measuring the deficit as a share of GDP adjusts for
inflation and, more broadly, shows the deficit in comparison to a
measure of the nation's ability to finance it.)

Meaningful comparisons between this year's deficit and last year's
require an adjustment for the rise and fall of President Biden's student
loan forgiveness plan. In September 2022, CBO increased its estimates of
federal outlays for fiscal year 2022 to reflect the cost of the loan
forgiveness (which was calculated as the present value of the loan
repayments that would have been forgiven under the Biden plan.) Then the
Supreme Court ruled the plan was unconstitutional. So, in August 2023,
CBO recorded a reduction in outlays in FY 2023 essentially reversing its
previous accounting. That reduction in outlays sharply reduces this
year's deficit. Excluding this outlay reduction, the deficit in the
first 11 months of FY 2023 is actually 7% of GDP---almost twice as large
as in the same period in FY 2022.

What has caused the deficit to increase this year?

As can be seen in the table below, [the main cause of the increase in
the deficit is lower revenues in FY 2023 compared to FY
2022]{.underline}. Non-interest outlays (excluding the effects of
student loan forgiveness) have been, on net, unchanged as a share of
GDP, while interest costs have increased. I discuss each of these in
turn.

Federal Budget This Year vs Last

Lower revenues

Revenues as a share of GDP were 2.7 percentage points lower in the first
11 months of FY 2023 than the same period last year. While the data to
parse the sources of the decline are not yet available, the following
factors are likely the most important:

[Lower capital gains than last year because of the **performance** of
the **stock market**.]{.underline}

[Higher-than-normal tax collections last year because of the **lag** in
the **indexation** of the tax **brackets for inflation**.]{.underline}

Unexpectedly high (and potentially fraudulent) take-up of the employee
retention credit.

The tax filing extension until October 16, because of severe weather,
provided to most California residents and business for taxes otherwise
due between January and September of 2023.

And, possibly, people choosing to minimize estimated tax payments given
high interest rates.

The first two factors explain why [tax revenues are down this year from
last year's unusually high level.]{.underline} The figure below shows
individual and corporate income tax collections as a share of GDP
through July 2023 (I use S&P's estimate of monthly GDP to make these
calculations). Tax receipts in 2023 have been about in line with their
longer-run averages---it is 2021 and 2022 that were unusual.

Corporate and Individual Income Tax Receipts as a Share of GDP (12-month
rolling average)

Furthermore, some (but not most) of the recent weakness will be made up
in October, when the California tax filing extension expires. The IRS
has also announced a moratorium on making payments on the employee
retention credit, as many of the claims appear to be fraudulent. In any
case, this credit was a one-time pandemic program and has no impact on
tax liabilities beyond 2021, so it won't be a source of weakness for
much longer.

Non-interest outlays

Non-interest outlays (adjusted for student loans) as a share of GDP over
the first 11 months of FY 2023 were unchanged from the FY 2022 level.
But, given that some pandemic-era spending---notably, the expanded child
tax credit---ended in 2022, why didn't outlays decline?

As shown in the table above, spending on pandemic-related programs did
decline, reducing outlays as a share of GDP by 1.3 percentage points.
However, this decline was offset by an increase in other outlays.

Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid edged up as a share
of GDP, reflecting the ongoing retirement of the baby boomers as well as
decreased recoveries of advance Medicare payments made during the
pandemic. (See the box below for a discussion of the effects of
inflation on spending as a share of GDP.) But other spending increased
more. Much of this increase is either temporary or one-time---including
an increase in FDIC spending related to the bank failures in spring 2023
(money which the FDIC expects to largely recoup), a decrease in spectrum
auction proceeds, and an increase in outlays owing to the Employee
Retention Tax Credit discussed above.

Interest on the debt

Net interest payments as a share of GDP increased 0.4 percentage
point---reflecting higher interest rates on the debt. If these higher
rates are the result of inflation, then, as discussed in the box, they
do raise the deficit---but that rise in the deficit doesn't end up
increasing the level of debt relative to GDP.

[What does the recent increase in real interest rates imply for the
federal debt trajectory?]{.underline}

[Real interest rates have increased sharply in recent
months]{.underline}. The most recent reading from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Cleveland (which uses a variety of measures of inflation
expectations to calculate real rates) shows that the real interest rate
on the 10-year Treasury was 1.7% in September---much higher than in the
recent past.

Does this mean that the era of low interest rates is over---and does it
mean that we should worry a lot more about the federal debt? Maybe, but
it is much too soon to tell.

[First---given the unusual economic conditions since the beginning of
the pandemic, it is way too soon to know whether **these higher real
rates will persist**]{.underline}. Second, even if they do persist, [it
matters why **rates have increased**]{.underline}. If [rates have
increased because **productivity growth**]{.underline} has
increased---for example, in response to AI---[then such an increase will
also be **neutral** for the **fiscal outlook**]{.underline}, as shown in
the equation in the box. If real rates have increased for other
reasons---increasing worries about the fiscal trajectory, or the Fitch
Ratings downgrade of the U.S. debt, for example, then it is possible
that we will look back on this recent rise in rates as a turning point.

But CBO has long assumed that real interest rates would rise over time.
For example, in their economic projections published this summer, they
assume that, in 2025, once inflation is back to its pre-pandemic level,
the real rate on 10-year Treasuries will be 1.6 percent---just a little
lower than the most recent reading from the Cleveland Fed. That means
that the recent rise in rates, even if it were to persist, would have
only small effects on CBO's long-run budget projections---projections on
which most budget analysts rely, and which do show that we are on an
unsustainable course.

Of course, for those who believed that interest rates would rise less
than what CBO was projecting and felt more sanguine about the fiscal
trajectory because of that belief, the recent rise in rates might be a
reason to worry more. But there is still too much uncertainty to
conclude that the fiscal outlook has materially changed because of
higher interest rates.

Real 10-Year Treasury Interest Rate

How does higher inflation affect the budget?

Some commentators have pointed to inflation as a factor boosting the
deficit. And while **[inflation]{.underline}** does increase the dollar
value of the deficit, it [lowers the ratio of debt to GDP, the **key
metric** of fiscal **sustainability.**]{.underline} [In other
words,]{.underline} **[high inflation is good for the federal
budget]{.underline}**.

To see why, we need to get just a bit wonky. The change in the ratio of
debt to GDP from one year to the next is equal to the primary deficit
(revenues less non-interest spending) plus the debt to GDP ratio
multiplied by the difference between the nominal interest rate paid on
the debt less the nominal growth rate of GDP:

inflation equation

What does an increase in inflation do? First, it reduces the primary
deficit as a share of GDP somewhat, because GDP rises with inflation,
whereas not all federal expenditures do. For example, Medicare payments
to physicians are fixed in nominal terms and don't rise with inflation.
So the first term in the equation falls a bit when inflation increases.

[Second, a rise in inflation raises the interest rate actually paid on
federal debt by less than it raises the growth rate of nominal GDP,
because not all federal debt is rolled over every
year]{.underline}---that is, [the federal government]{.underline}
[locked in **lower interest rates** in the **past** on **some of its
debt.**]{.underline} A rise in interest rates due to higher inflation
does raise interest payments and the deficit as a share of GDP because
some debt is issued at the higher rates, but it lowers the debt to GDP
ratio. (If all debt were continually rolled over, a rise in interest
rates due to higher inflation would have no effect on the debt to GDP
ratio even as it raised the deficit relative to GDP.)

### No Impact - Econ

#### Decline doesn't cause war.

Dr. Stephen M. **Walt 20**, Robert and Renée Belfer Professor of
International Relations at Harvard University, PhD in International
Relations (with Distinction) from Stanford University, MA in Political
Science from the University of California, Berkeley, "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", Foreign Policy, 5/13/2020,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/

[**On balance, however**, I do **not** think that **even the
extraordinary economic conditions** we are witnessing today are going to
have **much impact** on the likelihood of war. Why? First of all, if
depressions were a powerful cause of war, there would be a lot **more of
the latter**]{.underline}. To take one example, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has suffered **40 or
more recessions**]{.underline} since the country was founded, [yet it
has fought **perhaps 20** interstate wars, **most** of them
**unrelated** to the state of the **econ**omy.]{.underline} To
paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock
market, **[if recessions were a powerful cause of war, they would have
predicted "nine out of the last five (or fewer)."]{.underline}**

[Second, states do not start wars unless they believe they will win a
**quick** and relatively **cheap** victory]{.underline}. As John
Mearsheimer showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence,
[national leaders avoid war when they are convinced it will be long,
bloody, costly, and uncertain]{.underline}. To choose war, political
leaders have to convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap,
and decisive victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost.
Europe went to war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid
and easy victory, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg
in order to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq
attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was
in disarray and would be easy to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq
in 2003 convinced the war would be short, successful, and pay for
itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [**No matter what a country's economic condition might
be**, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do so
quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability of
success]{.underline}.

[Third, and most important, the primary **motiv**ation for most wars is
the desire for **security**, **not economic gain**. For this reason, the
odds of war **increase** when states believe the **long-term balance of
power** may be shifting against them]{.underline}, when they are
convinced that adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be
accommodated, and when they are confident they can reverse the
unfavorable trends and establish a secure position if they act now. The
historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that "every war between Great
Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as
a war of conquest," and that remains true of most wars fought since
then.

[The bottom line:]{.underline} Economic conditions (i.e., [a depression)
may affect the broader political environment]{.underline} in which
decisions for war or peace are made, [but they are **only one factor**
among **many** and **rarely the most significant**.
**Even**]{.underline} if the COVID-19 pandemic has [**large**, lasting,
and negative effects on the world economy]{.underline}---as seems quite
likely---[it is **not likely** to affect the probability of war **very
much**, especially in the **short term**]{.underline}.

### AT: Dollar Heg Impact\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Default [won't happen]{.underline}, but [even if it did]{.underline} dollar heg would remain intact.

Arthur R. **Kroeber 23**. Managing director of GaveKal Dragonomics.
\"China Doesn't Want a U.S. Debt Default\". Foreign Policy. 1-27-2023.
https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/01/27/us-debt-default-china-global-financial-system-treasurys/

[The big political drama in Washington over the next few months will be
the fight over the federal debt ceiling.]{.underline} [The worst-case
scenario is that Congress refuses to raise the ceiling and the U.S.
Treasury defaults on its debt]{.underline}. Since U.S. Treasury debt
powers the entire world financial system, the result could be a massive
global economic crisis. If that happens, how well would the world's
second-biggest economy, China, survive the crash? [And would a U.S.
default give China an opening to create a **new global financial**
**system** **less dependent on** the]{.underline}
[**dollar**?]{.underline}

The good news is that **[a U.S. default is improbable]{.underline}**.
[Most likely, Congress will reach a deal under which the debt
ceiling]{.underline} is raised now in exchange for promises of federal
spending cuts later. This is what the "Tea Party" Congress did in 2011
and the outcome that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has
forecast.

[If negotiations fail]{.underline}, the **[Biden]{.underline}**
administration still has [plenty of options to **prevent a
default**,]{.underline} [ranging from **accounting tricks** to a
decision to **ignore the debt ceiling altogether**, on the grounds that
it violates the U.S. Constitution's requirement for timely repayment of
all federal debts.]{.underline}

But strange things sometimes happen in Washington. If the United States
did default, how bad would the damage be? No one knows for sure; the
world economy is just too complex. One real possibility is a global
financial crisis and economic depression worse even than the one in
2008-09. This is because the huge U.S. Treasurys market underpins the
global financial system in two ways. Much credit around the world is
priced, directly or indirectly, in relation to the interest rates on
U.S. Treasurys. And many loans both in the United States and in the rest
of the world depend on U.S. Treasurys as collateral.

In a default, interest rates on U.S. Treasurys would skyrocket (because
investors would demand a higher rate in exchange for taking the risk
that they might not be paid back), and Treasurys might no longer be
usable as collateral (because their underlying value would not be
clear). The entire world financial system could simply freeze. Moreover,
one of the main tools used to contain the 2008-09 crisis---massive money
creation by the Federal Reserve to fund purchases of U.S.
Treasurys---might not work if the Treasurys market stopped functioning.

As in 2008-09, a global economic meltdown would hurt China a lot. It
would fare slightly better than most other countries because it runs a
closed-off financial system that relies mainly on domestic savings and
is protected from the ups-and-downs of global financial instability by
capital controls. But the impact of a U.S. debt default would still be
devastating. In 2008-09, the loss of trade finance and collapse in
global demand sent China's exports plummeting by nearly 20 percent, and
upwards of 20 million workers lost their jobs.

Fifteen years ago, China's government could respond by unleashing a
massive debt-financed economic stimulus program because the country's
debt level, at 140 percent of GDP, was relatively low and it still had
significant needs for infrastructure and housing. Today, the space for
maneuver is far narrower: Debt has soared to nearly 300 percent of GDP,
and both infrastructure and housing are seriously overbuilt.

Though severe, the economic consequences to China of a U.S. default
would probably not be threatening to the Chinese Communist Party's
power. Whatever pain the Chinese people were forced to suffer could
rightly be blamed on outside forces. And in a pinch, the government
could still support a minimum level of growth by adding to its debt
pile, since it would be borrowing from its own future, not from foreign
creditors.

This leads us to the second question. If the United States defaults,
could China create a substitute system built around the renminbi? The
short answer is no.

The U.S. Treasurys market is huge and deeply intertwined with the rest
of the world. (That's why a default would be so bad.) There is \$23.9
trillion in Treasury bonds outstanding; foreigners hold \$7.5 trillion,
or 31 percent, of that pile. Daily trading last year averaged \$600
billion. In practice, this means it is easy for large companies and
governments to hold Treasurys in any amount, trade large volumes
quickly, and easily obtain or dispose of as much collateral as they need
for borrowing.

China's government bond market is nowhere near big enough, liquid
enough, or integrated enough with the rest of the world to substitute
for U.S. Treasurys. According to calculations by my colleagues, the
total value of Chinese government bonds on issue---\$3.3 trillion---is
less than half the value of U.S. Treasurys held by foreigners. The
foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds are a mere \$340 billion,
one-twentieth of the country's Treasury holdings. The daily turnover of
China's government bond market is \$30 billion, about 5 percent of the
Treasurys market average.

After the 2008-09 crisis, because it decided it was too dependent on the
dollar-driven global financial system, China tried hard to
internationalize the renminbi. Its efforts have borne little fruit. The
renminbi accounts for just 2.8 percent of global official central bank
reserves (compared with 60 percent for the U.S. dollar and 20 percent
for the euro), a figure that has not changed much in the past several
years. Similarly, it makes up just 2.4 percent of global trading in
foreign exchange.

China has failed to internationalize the renminbi for the same reason it
is relatively insulated from global financial shocks: capital controls.
Bringing money in and out of China still requires permission from
Beijing. From the Chinese government's point of view, this is good. When
economic conditions worsen in China, it is hard for Chinese citizens to
take their money out and park it abroad. And by limiting the amount of
money foreigners can bring into China and controlling the conditions
under which they can take it out, Beijing reduces the risk that a global
financial panic leads to a damaging outflow of foreign investor capital.
As a result, Beijing does not have to work so hard to maintain domestic
financial stability.

The problem is that [if you want to create a substitute for the **U.S.
Treasurys market**]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} for the world's
linchpin currency, **[the U.S. dollar]{.underline}**---[you have to
accept those risks.]{.underline} [International investors need to feel
confident that they can put as much money as they want into your bonds,
that the value of those holdings will stay relatively stable, and that
they can cash out whenever they want with no penalty.]{.underline}

At present, [foreign investors generally do not believe that **China's
government bond market** can **deliver any of those
things**]{.underline}. They are perfectly happy to put small amounts
into Chinese bonds to diversify their portfolios or to take advantage of
short-term rises in the value of the renminbi. But [more than one
central banker has told my research team that they are **reluctant** to
put much of their **reserves** into **Chinese bonds** because they worry
the funds would not be available when **they really needed
them**]{.underline}---i[.e., in an emergency.]{.underline} [That
sentiment is even more strongly held by private financial institutions
that trade far more frequently and want a source of safe collateral to
back daily transactions.]{.underline}

[In short, the reason the U.S. Treasurys market is such an indispensable
part of the global financial system is that the United States is willing
to take on financial risks that no other country---even one as big as
China---dares to and has proved over many decades that it can **manage
those risks safely**]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline}, perhaps
unfortunately, **[no alternative]{.underline}**. So[, if reckless
politicking in Washington **forces the market to freeze
up**]{.underline}, [the world will suffer immense **economic** and
**financial damage**]{.underline}. Like everyone else, [China will be an
unlucky bystander, forced to wait until the United States can sort out
its **internal disputes** and resume its **stewardship of the global
financial system**.]{.underline}

### AT: Credit Downgrade Impact\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Downgrade [has already happened]{.underline} and has [no impact]{.underline}.

Brad W. **Setser 23**. Whitney Shepardson senior fellow at the Council
on Foreign Relations, PhD in International Relations from Oxford. \"Does
Fitch's Downgrade of U.S. Debt Really Matter?.\" Council on Foreign
Relations. 8-16-2023.
https://www.cfr.org/article/does-fitchs-downgrade-us-debt-really-matter

[Does the **downgrade** have **any** implications for the **dollar** as
a **reserve currency**?]{.underline}

**[No]{.underline}**; [the dollar's role as the **main global reserve
currency**---and the main currency for global payments---isn't a
**reward** for **winning** a **fiscal beauty context**.]{.underline} In
fact, excessive fiscal virtue (via restricted government borrowing and a
limited supply of bonds) often is an impediment to a currency's ability
to play a big global role.

[The dollar's global role is largely a function of the fact that U.S.
Treasury bonds are **unparalleled** as a **global reserve
asset**]{.underline}. [That stems from the size of the U.S. economy and
the vast sums the United States has **borrowed over time. No other
government bond**]{.underline} **[market]{.underline}** [matches the
scale of the **\$20 billion** Treasury market]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} no other market is big enough to [absorb the bulk of
the **world's roughly** **\$12 trillion** in **reserves**]{.underline}.

Germany actually issues so few federal government bonds that it cannot
meet the global demand for euro reserves. This has held back the
expansion of the global role of the euro -- and effectively kept
France's government bonds from becoming the world's second most
important reserve asset. Japan's government bond market is in theory one
of the world's biggest, but it currently lacks liquidity thanks in part
to the scale of the monetary easing operations of the Bank of Japan.
China's capital controls and the small scale of the market for its
central government bonds remain an impediment to a bigger international
role for the yuan.

[The Treasury market offers reserve managers a unique combination of
liquidity and yield---which ultimately matters more than whether the
**Treasury** is **traded AAA or AA+.**]{.underline}
