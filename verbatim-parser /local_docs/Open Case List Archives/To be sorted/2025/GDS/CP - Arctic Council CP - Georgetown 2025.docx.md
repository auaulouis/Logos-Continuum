2\. [**Rejoin the Arctic Council, or ensure continued support for its
most pressing initiatives**. The Arctic Council has proven to be the
foremost player in international climate policy in the region, and **it
was specifically designed to function in spite of the security
differences of its member states.** The United States and its allies
have far more to lose by boycotting the organization than they stand to
gain.]{.underline} Washington should resume participation in the Arctic
Council as soon as possible; if this is infeasible during Russia's
chairmanship of the council, [the United States should continue its
support for the organization's six expert working groups, or seek to
duplicate their activities with regional partners or through other
forums. Norway will take over as chair of the council in
2023.]{.underline}

**[The Arctic Council was responsible for several activities of key
import to US Arctic interests.]{.underline}** First, [the organization
was a principal organizer of scientific collaboration that included
Russia, most of which has ground to a halt.]{.underline} Second, [the
Arctic Council created a working group to study radiological sites in
the Arctic, create procedures to recover hazardous materials, and craft
contingency plans in case of nuclear contamination.]{.underline} The
council was set to convene this summer to discuss nuclear waste
disposal, but the meeting has been canceled. Third, [the organization
was largely responsible for monitoring environmental conditions and
pollution in the Arctic, and experts fear that without adequate
oversight, Russia will be free to conduct harmful activities such as
gas-flaring.]{.underline}

Analysts have proposed that [the Arctic Council member states other than
Russia duplicate the most important organizational projects among
themselves, without Russian involvement]{.underline}. In fact, the
United States has successfully engaged allies to pursue environmental
goals outside of the forum in the past. Moreover, other organizations,
such as the International Arctic Science Committee, have continued their
operations without Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and could
provide an alternative for regional engagement.

However, although this approach would yield more progress than
suspending Arctic cooperation entirely, **[Russian involvement in Arctic
climate collaboration is critical]{.underline}**. [The nation owns more
than half of the Arctic coastline, contains the vast majority of the
area's radiological contamination, and samples and data from Russia are
indispensable for climate change research.]{.underline} Therefore, [the
United States should seek to resume its participation in the Arctic
Council in 2023 at the latest; Washington should also address the
environmental concerns that are normally managed by the council's
working groups with other Arctic states until that point]{.underline}.
[US policymakers could also work through the Northern Forum, a
Russia-based international organization **that coordinates efforts among
subnational Arctic governments;** however, there is no full substitute
for national-level collaboration on larger environmental
priorities.]{.underline}

In the future, [the United States cannot allow its relationship with the
Arctic Council to become a victim of security competition.]{.underline}
**[One of the principal strengths of the Arctic Council is its explicit
commitment to avoid security issues.]{.underline}** Then Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo upended this norm by raising security concerns in the
forum in 2019, and the United States and its Western partners boycotted
the organization in response to another security situation, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. [If the United States continues to link its
security concerns with its Arctic Council activities, the organization's
ability to safeguard the Arctic environment could be critically
eroded.]{.underline}

#### The CP solves the aff and restores the credibility of the Arctic Council which answers their solvency deficits -- only the Arctic Council can mediate disputes and prevent great power war.

Due to the soft power strategy, [Arctic governance has created the
Arctic Council as a model of inclusiveness and high-level
intergovernmental forum, where science diplomacy has played a pivotal
role in promoting cooperation, coordination, and interaction among
circumpolar states on issues of common concern, including those relating
to sustainable development and environmental protection.]{.underline}
[The council brings together the eight Arctic member states,
organizations representing the region's native peoples, and several
observer states and organizations, **including China**.]{.underline}
\[24\] The Arctic Council was officially established in 1996 under the
terms of the Ottawa Declaration, whose [signatories were Canada, Denmark
(including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the U.S., Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Russia and Sweden]{.underline}. It cannot deal with military and
sovereignty issues (which are excluded from its field of competence) to
concentrate discussions on subjects that can more easily be the subject
of consensus such as scientific cooperation, environmental protection,
well-being and economic development of indigenous populations, safety of
navigation, etc. Much of the Arctic Council's work focuses on scientific
and technical topics that are studied in thematic working groups. \[25\]

Outside the Arctic Council, there are a multitude of official
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, whose purpose is to
manage various issues in the Arctic; The Arctic Circle is an
organization established by Iceland on 15 April 2013. Its mission is to
facilitate dialogue between political leaders, business leaders,
environmental experts, scientists, indigenous representatives and other
international stakeholders on issues related to the Arctic. The four
Arctic states located in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
and Iceland, which has strong historical ties to Europe, are known as
the "Nordic countries". Much of the cooperation between these states
relates to issues they have in common with Western Russia, the Baltic
and Barents Sea regions and the greater Nordic region, including
international waters. In addition to those organizations, six other
organizations representing Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have
permanent participant status. \[26\]

[There are also non-Arctic countries that have been granted observer
status, such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, France, Spain,
Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and
Switzerland.]{.underline} This is in addition to many other
international organizations such as the UN through some of its programs
related to environment and development. European and Asian countries
have shown their interests and responsibilities in a strategy document
on the Arctic. [The EU adopted an integrated policy on the Arctic zone
in 2016 and is currently considering updating these
guidelines.]{.underline} Asian states' ongoing research agendas and
scientific cooperation have made their engagement crucial for the
development of Arctic knowledge. [Japan and South Korea launched the
construction of an icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be deployed in
2026.]{.underline} \[27\]

There is no doubt that [the war in Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult.]{.underline} However, **[the
U.S. can expect Russia to remain open to peaceful
discussions]{.underline}**. Even at the height of the Cold War, [the
Soviet Union cooperated with the West on Arctic issues, including
initiatives such as the 1973 Convention on the Conservation of Polar
Bears \[28\] and the 1987 Murmansk Initiative toward regional
cooperation,]{.underline} recognizing the special responsibilities and
special interests of the States of the Arctic Region in relation to the
protection of the fauna and flora of the Arctic Region and recognizing
that the polar bear is a significant resource of the Arctic Region that
requires additional protection.

[**To manage the escalating tensions in the Arctic, states must strike a
balance between cooperation and strategic rivalry through bilateral and
international diplomacy**. Important Arctic nations like the U.S. and
Russia hold bilateral discussions to lower the likelihood of armed
conflict, frequently concentrating on keeping lines of communication
open about security-related issues]{.underline}. Despite the modest
progress made in [these discussions]{.underline}, they **[are
nonetheless crucial for defusing any confrontations considering the
Arctic's growing militarization.]{.underline}** [Security matters are
noticeably missing from multilateral institutions like the Arctic
Council, which **offers all Arctic nations a diplomatic forum to debate
environmental, economic, and indigenous issues.**]{.underline}

Despite the current high tensions and given the potential for mutual
destruction, [Russia and NATO share an interest in maintaining peace in
the Arctic region in addition to diplomatic frameworks that provide
legal channels for settling competing claims to seabed resources, such
as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS).]{.underline} \[29\] [NATO's attempts to coordinate security
plans among its Arctic member states, strengthening regional stability,
are another example of multilateral diplomacy in action.]{.underline}
Although these diplomatic efforts aid in the management of tensions,
they frequently fail to address the more serious security threats
brought on by military buildups and geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic.
\[30\]

Conclusion

[With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military
supremacy driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed
geopolitical region.]{.underline} **[Global powers like China, the U.S.,
and Russia are vying for control of the region because of the melting
ice, which has made it more accessible for economic
exploitation.]{.underline}** Territorial claims overlap when states
bolster their military presence, raising the possibility of error or
conflict. **[The Arctic runs the risk of turning into a hot spot for
future hostilities in the absence of defined methods to handle these
tensions.]{.underline}**

**[There is an urgent need for more international collaboration to stop
this escalation.]{.underline}** Although the UNCLOS and the Arctic
Council have facilitated communication, they are ill-equipped to handle
the region's growing security concerns. **[Redoubled efforts should
concentrate on broadening diplomatic channels to cover security and
military matters, setting up a platform for Arctic countries to discuss
weapons control and developing guidelines for military
behavior.]{.underline}** The moment has come for Arctic countries to
engage in formalized diplomatic discussion that covers military and
security matters. Whether through a distinct treaty or [the Arctic
Council]{.underline}, a new global security framework **[might offer a
forum for controlling the military buildup, negotiating arms control
measures, and defining explicit rules of engagement to avoid
unintentional conflicts. In addition to lowering the likelihood of
violence, this would establish a crisis management system in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** [International organizations must also mediate
conflicts and make sure that competition in the Arctic doesn't
jeopardize indigenous rights or the sustainability of the environment.
**In the face of mounting global pressure, the Arctic can only continue
to be a region of harmony, collaboration, and shared wealth via
concerted effort.**]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Scientific Cooperation

#### Reengagement with the Arctic Council solves scientific cooperation -- it's the [only]{.underline} institution that can create cooperation

**Pamuk et al., Reuters senior foreign policy correspondent, 23**

\[Humeyra Pamuk, Gloria Dickie, Reuters writer, Gwladys Fouche, Reuters
writer, 5/9/23, Reuters, "Fears mount for the Arctic as cooperation with
Russia stalls",
<https://www.reuters.com/world/fears-mount-arctic-cooperation-with-russia-stalls-2023-05-09/>,
accessed 6/12/25\]

WASHINGTON/LONDON/OSLO, May 9 (Reuters) - [For nearly three decades,
**the Arctic Council has been a successful example of post-Cold War
cooperation.**]{.underline}

Its eight members, including [Russia and the United States]{.underline},
[have cooperated on climate-change research and social development
across the ecologically sensitive region.]{.underline}

Now, a year after council members stopped working with Russia following
its invasion of Ukraine and as Norway prepares to assume the
chairmanship from Moscow on May 11, [experts are asking whether the
polar body\'s viability is at risk if it cannot cooperate with the
country that controls over half of the Arctic coastline.]{.underline}

[An ineffective Arctic Council could have dire implications for the
region\'s environment and its 4 million inhabitants who face the effects
of melting sea ice and the interest of non-Arctic countries in the
region\'s mostly untapped mineral resources.]{.underline}

The work of [the council]{.underline}, which comprises the eight Arctic
states of Finland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Canada and
the United States, in the past [has produced binding agreements on
environmental protection and preservation.]{.underline}

It is also a rare platform giving a voice to the region\'s Indigenous
peoples. It does not deal with security issues.

But with the end of cooperation with Moscow, [about a third of the
council\'s 130 projects are on hold, new projects cannot go ahead and
existing ones cannot be renewed. Western and Russian scientists no
longer share climate change findings, for example, and cooperation for
possible search-and-rescue missions or oil spills has
stopped.]{.underline}

\"I am worried that this will really hobble the ability of the Arctic
Council to work through these various issues,\" U.S. senator Angus King
from Maine told Reuters.

A DIVIDED REGION?

The Arctic is warming, about four times as fast as the rest of the
world.

As sea ice vanishes, polar waters are opening to shipping and other
industries eager to exploit the region\'s bounty of natural resources,
including oil, gas, and metals such as gold, iron and rare earths.

The discord between Russia and the other Arctic Council members means
that an effective response to these changes is far less likely.

\'And. frankly, if you\'re going to come into town and say you have
diagnosed what is happening in our city, and you don\'t even know

\"Norway has a big challenge,\" said John Holdren, co-director of the
Harvard Kennedy School\'s Arctic Initiative and a former science advisor
to U.S. President Barack Obama. \"That\'s how to rescue as much as
possible of the Arctic Council\'s good work in the absence of Russia.\"

Russia argues this work cannot continue without it.

**[The council is weakening]{.underline}**, Russian Arctic Ambassador
Nikolay Korchunov told Reuters, saying he was not confident it \"will be
able to remain the main platform on Arctic issues\".

[Adding to the worries is the possibility that Russia will go its own
way on issues affecting the region or even establish a rival
council.]{.underline}

Recently, it has taken steps to expand cooperation in the Arctic with
non-Arctic states. On April 24, Russia and China signed a memorandum
establishing cooperation between the countries\' coast guards in the
Arctic.

Days earlier, on April 14, Russia invited China, India, Brazil and South
Africa - the BRICS - to conduct research at its settlement on Svalbard,
an Arctic archipelago under Norwegian sovereignty where other countries
can operate under a 1920 Treaty.

\"Russia is seeking to build relationships with some non-Arctic
countries, particularly China, and that is a development that is
concerning,\" said David Balton, executive director of the Arctic
Steering Committee at the White House.

Russia\'s Korchunov said Moscow welcomed non-Arctic states in the
region, provided they did not come with a military agenda.

[\"Our focus on a purely peaceful format of partnership also reflects
the need of development of scientific and economic cooperation with
non-Arctic countries,\" he said.]{.underline}

HOW TO ENGAGE WITH MOSCOW

[**Norway says it is \"optimistic\" a seamless transition of the
chairmanship from Russia can be achieved** as it is in the interest of
all Arctic states to maintain the Arctic Council.]{.underline}

**[\"We need to safeguard the Arctic Council as the most important
international forum for Arctic cooperation and make sure it
survives,\"]{.underline}** Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad
Petersson told Reuters.

That will not be easy, given Oslo\'s own strained relations with Moscow.
In April, Oslo expelled 15 Russian diplomats saying they were spies.
Moscow denied the accusations and Korchunov said the expulsions
undermined the trust needed for cooperation.

Analysts say NATO-member [Norway, which shares an Arctic border with
Russia, is still well-placed to handle the delicate balancing act with
Moscow.]{.underline}

[\"Norway has been the most outspoken when it comes to the possibility
of keeping the door ajar so that **Russia could**, when politically
feasible, **be part of the Arctic Council again**]{.underline},\" said
Svein Vigeland Rottem, a senior researcher in Arctic governance and
security at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo.

Indeed, said lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, **[the council will
eventually need to reengage with Russia]{.underline}** even if that
moment has not yet arrived.

**[\"I don\'t see an Arctic Council without Russia in the
future,\"]{.underline}** said Larsen, a Greenland lawmaker at the Danish
Parliament and the Chair of Arctic Parliamentarians, a body including
MPs from across the Arctic countries.

\"We need to be prepared for a different time when the war (in Ukraine)
one day will be over.\"

defense equipment and consumer electronics.**]{.underline} Other sources
of mineral wealth in the region include large stores of gold, platinum,
tin, diamonds, and zircon-titanium, as explored in a recent study
published in Ore Geology Reviews\[4\]. As Russian forces continue to
batter civilian targets in Ukraine, acting in unrestrained defiance of
international law, nations and organizations around the world have
chastised and imposed harsh punishments on Moscow. But justified though
this outrage may be, **[in some cases the perils of alienating Russia
outweigh the benefits.]{.underline}**

stakeholders]{.underline}. These member states act as stewards of the
region, implementing a patchwork of national, regional, and
international treaties and customary laws related to environmental
protection, emergency preparedness, and sustainable development. [The
chairmanship of the council rotates every two years among the eight
member states. Russia has been at its helm\[10\] since May
2021.]{.underline}

[Importantly, the council itself doesn\'t make or execute laws; rather,
**it provides a forum for member states to reach multilateral
agreements.** Member states, for example, can draft legally binding
agreements that carve out shared responsibilities for regional issues.
Past agreements have centered on search and rescue missions\[11\],
marine oil pollution preparedness\[12\], and enhanced scientific
cooperation\[13\].]{.underline}

[Agreements reached at the Arctic Council supplement a variety of
international legal and policy frameworks, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea\[14\] and the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) Polar Code\[15\]. Its work is also complemented by a
patchwork of other regional and international organizations with varying
scopes and focuses. Some of these include the Arctic Coast Guard
Forum\[16\], IMO, Saami Council\[17\], and Barents Euro-Arctic
Council\[18\]---though, like the Arctic Council, the latter recently
suspended cooperation\[19\] with Russia over its invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}

In short, there is no one entity that bears ultimate responsibility for
Arctic governance. [Relative peace in the region has long rested on the
assumption that for the eight states wishing to preserve---and retain
control of---their Arctic territories, the benefits of cooperation
outweigh its drawbacks. And in the past, this utilitarian balance has
held despite provocations.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Climate

#### Arctic Council solves climate change

**Herrmann, The Arctic Institute senior fellow, 19**

\[Victoria, 11/19/19, Arctic Institute, "WANTED: A Sustained, Engaged,
and Committed American Arctic Nation",
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/wanted-sustained-engaged-committed-american-arctic-nation/>\]

[Augment America's commitment to leading on climate action in the
region,]{.underline} both at home and abroad

[Creating a strong reputation for credibility regarding the commitment
to invest in low-carbon economic growth, climate-resilient
infrastructure development, and calculated collaboration across borders
on environmental treaties provides the necessary next-step for American
Arctic leadership. Like the Special Representative and Steering
Committee, momentum exists upon which to build.]{.underline}

Domestically, the Green New Deal offers an opportunity to lead in the
American Arctic by mitigating climate threats through a "10-year
mobilization" to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. The
United States could extend its vision in sourcing 100 percent of the
country's electricity from renewable and zero-emission power, digitizing
the power grid, updating building efficiency, and overhauling
transportation to Alaska. In a state where many communities are diesel
reliant off-road and off-grid settlements, this is not an easy task.
However, [committing federal technical and financial resources that
empower U.S. Arctic communities to overcome energy and climate security
risks would send a strong message to other Arctic nations about the
United States' ability to lead by example.]{.underline}

Internationally, [the United States can show climate leadership by
committing to reduce black carbon emissions in the Arctic.]{.underline}
Black carbon is the soot produced by burning fossil fuels and biomass,
which increases snow and ice melt by darkening their surfaces and, in
turn, increasing their retention of warmth. **[Roughly one-third of
warming in the Arctic is caused by black carbon emission of Arctic
Council members, including the United States.]{.underline}** Under the
Trump Administration, America has pulled out from joint reduction
targets through the Arctic Council. This was a grave mistake and a
missed opportunity for straightforward cross-border cooperation. [The
United States can show regional leadership by reversing this decision
and re-committing to its target reductions for black
carbon.]{.underline}

[The proposed policy commitments outlined in this commentary are not
blue-sky proposals. **They are tangible and targeted options for
overcoming the geopolitical challenges of climate change and enhancing
American Arctic leadership. However, they could only be achieved by a
driven, bipartisan effort.**]{.underline}

[Climate change impacts are already costing billions of dollars in
damages, undermining national security, devastating regional economies,
and inflicting irreplaceable cultural loss on the four million people
that call the Arctic home.]{.underline} In 2019, the [United States has
the potential to act courageously and cooperatively across the Arctic by
taking advantage of the low-hanging opportunities presented
here]{.underline}. It is now up to Congress to adopt these measures and
push America further into its still unrealized Arctic leadership
position. [However, if it chooses to continue the path of Arctic
reluctance, then every American will face the consequences of the
impending Arctic thaw.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- War

#### Arctic Council collaboration prevents militarization in the Arctic which is [uniquely]{.underline} prone to [miscalculation and escalation]{.underline}

**Gricius, Arctic Defense Security Network graduate fellow, 22**

\[Gabriella, a graduate fellow with the North American and Arctic

public., 4/20/22, Colorado State University, "Why freezing the Arctic
Council is bad news for global security",
<https://source.colostate.edu/why-freezing-the-arctic-council-is-bad-news-for-global-security/>,
accessed 6/13/25\]

For the past quarter-century[, the Arctic has been a unique zone of
cooperation among the eight countries of the high north: Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.
Even when relations between Moscow and the West soured, the Arctic
Council's work was a reminder that multilateral partnerships could
thrive despite global discord.]{.underline}

[The point of the Arctic Council is to foster collaboration in areas
such as scientific research, search and rescue operations and the
challenges posed by climate change.]{.underline} Under its auspices,
[friends and adversaries alike -- as well as nonstate actors, such as
Indigenous groups -- can sit down, talk and find common ground. In early
2022, lawmakers from Norway nominated the council for the Nobel Peace
Prize for its collaborative spirit.]{.underline}

[That collaboration ended shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022. One week after the start of the war, seven of the eight
Arctic Council members announced that they would "pause" their work with
the organization. Russia, which holds the council's presidency through
2023, was left ostracized.]{.underline}

[The freeze of the Arctic Council is a loss on many fronts. As a scholar
of Arctic security, I see **cooperation in the region as essential to
global security, and I believe an expanded set of institutions is needed
to reflect new global realities as the Arctic warms.**]{.underline}

Security and cooperation in the Arctic

The eight Arctic countries formed the Arctic Council in 1996. [While the
council explicitly steers clear of military issues, its members are
stewards of the Arctic region. Unsurprisingly, **the organization has
grown in importance with global warming.**]{.underline}

[Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new shipping
routes and, likely, expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas and
other critical minerals -- changes that could spur **conflict if not
handled carefully.**]{.underline}

Through the council, [the Arctic states have made agreements related to
search and rescue operations, oil pollution and scientific
collaboration.]{.underline} The council has tracked environmental
changes in the region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment
reports. [Even when relations between East and West were at their worst,
including in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula
from Ukraine, joint endeavors in the Arctic remained
strong.]{.underline}

[Pausing the work of the Arctic Council was an understandable response
to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yet in doing so, **the other Arctic
countries lost a valuable line of communication with Moscow.** In time,
it will be important to resume the council or establish a new
institution in its place.]{.underline}

Indeed, [working with Russia in the Arctic is even more important now
than it was before the invasion. From a global security perspective,
**it is essential that the hot war in Europe be prevented from spilling
over into the Arctic and one of the world's last
wildernesses.**]{.underline}

The case for engaging Russia

Consider, for example, that [**while tensions are at an all-time high in
Ukraine, it might be easy to mistake a flock of geese or a meteor shower
for a military attack**. Having a way for errors like these to be
**quickly remedied will be important in this new era of geopolitical
competition.**]{.underline}

Preserving and enhancing cooperation in the Arctic will take bold
leadership. Some [critics argue that institutionalizing military
dialogue with Russia in the Arctic is an improper response to wanton
aggression in Eastern Europe and could be seen as legitimizing Russia's
actions. These are valid concerns.]{.underline}

However, **[giving up on cooperation would be a mistake.]{.underline}**
[The whole world will benefit if the high north can avoid the fate of
militarization, a costly arms race and the terrible specter of
war.]{.underline}

Ideally, [engaging Russia within an expanded set of regional
institutions -- an invigorated Arctic Council]{.underline}, to be sure,
but also a new military forum -- [would precipitate a cooperation
spiral, increasing cooperation that could help lessen tensions
elsewhere. **Even if collaboration were confined to the Arctic, this
would boost global security.**]{.underline}

A new Arctic?

In the past, the Arctic states sought to maintain peace and stability in
their region by divorcing contentious military issues from areas where
common ground was easier to find. This has been the modus vivendi of the
Arctic Council since its founding.

Going forward, it would be better to recognize that robust and ongoing
cooperation is needed on security issues, too. **[Trust between Russia
and the West might never return, but cooperation in the Arctic cannot be
allowed to disappear with it.]{.underline}**

#### Arctic Council solves militarization and miscalculation -- it's the only framework to resolve the aff's internal links

**Tingstad, Rand senior physical scientist, 20**

\[Abbie, 1/29/20, Defense One, "Today's Arctic Diplomacy Can't Handle
Tomorrow's Problems",
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/01/todays-arctic-diplomacy-cant-handle-tomorrows-problems/162719/>,
accessed 6/13/25\]

[The international structures that have helped address many Arctic
problems through negotiation and cooperation are insufficient for the
military and security challenges brought on by climate
change.]{.underline}

[Decades of diplomacy have fostered forums such as the Arctic Council,
which regularly brings together stakeholders (including Arctic and
non-Arctic government representatives, indigenous leaders, business
interests) to seek agreement on issues such as search and rescue, oil
pollution and scientific cooperation.]{.underline} Another one, [the
Arctic Frontiers conference, wraps up Jan. 30 in Tromsø, Norway. Other
meetings like the Arctic Circle, Arctic Dialogues, and the Arctic
Shipping Forum enable further debate.]{.underline}

But such [meetings and institutions have been less successful at
addressing military operations in the region.]{.underline} In part, this
is because if armed forces are present in the Arctic, it's often
connected to some high-stakes geopolitical issue --- [Russian activity
in Ukraine or the U.S. stance on Freedom of Navigation --- and thus
deliberately avoided.]{.underline} The Arctic Council, for example,
explicitly eschews any discussion of military matters. [The Arctic Coast
Guard Forum focuses on issues of safety, environmental stewardship, law
enforcement, and operational response]{.underline} --- but not military
operations.

[There is an Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and a limited number of
bi-lateral or multi-lateral Arctic security exercises.]{.underline}
These provide some opportunities for engagement but lack the consistency
or clear mission of non-military Arctic cooperative activities.
[Furthermore, the Security Forces Roundtable has excluded Russia since
2014, when it seized Crimea and launched military activity in
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Creating a regular, inclusive discussion of defense issues is vital for
the Arctic region, where the greatest near-term security risk may be
that of military miscalculation.]{.underline} Resource wars are far off
and unlikely; most potentially profitable ventures are in undisputed
areas. Investors and insurers can weigh profit and risk potential on
that front.

[But there are at least two scenarios that could lead to dangerous
military miscalculation:]{.underline}

[A race to militarize the Arctic, which will not only result in
diplomatic consequences and potentially dampen emerging economic
prospects, but also increase the likelihood of military assets coming
into close contact; or]{.underline}

**[The perception that there's a void in security and
stewardship]{.underline}** [-- fueled by potential increases in ship
collisions, illegal fishing, and demonstrated limitations in search and
rescue ability]{.underline} --- **[that opens the door for countries
like China to justify an increase in their own regional
capabilities.]{.underline}**

The former scenario represents too much security. [The latter could
emerge under too little. The two scenarios are equally dangerous and
shifting conditions could tip the balance in either direction. Either
could begin with non-adversarial intensions and "snowball" into
increased military activity and decreased space for dialogue and
cooperation. Both are avoidable, but only if there are opportunities to
gain mutual understanding, if not more formal security
cooperation.]{.underline}

What type of forum would fulfill such a need? There are three existing
options, none of which are presently ideal.

First, the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable could be more closely
modeled after the Arctic Council and Arctic Coast Guard Forum in their
focus on inclusivity, open and regular multi-lateral dialogue, and
finding common ground on policy. Given its explicit focus on military
issues and direct approach to dialogue, this is probably the best
option. The biggest hurdle here could be getting the U.S. to accept
Russian and (perhaps) Chinese membership.

Second, [**the Arctic Council or Arctic Coast Guard Forum could expand
their purviews to include Arctic regional-specific military
issues.**]{.underline} However, security issues are so sensitive that
including them could undermine these organizations' effectiveness in
conducting their present missions.

Third, forums such as the Arctic Circle (and perhaps smaller gatherings
such as the upcoming Arctic Frontiers meeting) could more robustly aim
for less formal, Track II diplomacy. This may already be happening to
some extent. The Arctic Circle especially attracts diverse and sometimes
high-level government official participation. It isn't clear, however,
whether such a backchannel diplomatic approach could be sufficiently
scaled up in a future Arctic where there are more frequent and
fast-moving issues on the table.

**[Dialogue on touchy military issues in the Arctic is becoming
increasingly important to avoid either the "military heavy" or "security
void" scenarios.]{.underline}** **[An Arctic war would have no
winner.]{.underline}** Anyone who ends up on top militarily in the
region would be left with the costly and time-intensive task of running
security in a region too devastated to enjoy what little economic gains
are possible as more of it becomes navigable.

### Net Benefit -- Politics

[It may not sound like something Trump would want a stake in, but
**there is a chance that the Arctic Council does not have his attention
whatsoever due to its limited activity**]{.underline} -- **[and because
there are plenty of other things that keep him occupied.]{.underline}**
If that is the case, [it may actually prove to be an advantage for the
Arctic Council, which under normal circumstances would otherwise
strengthen its relevance if meetings were prioritized by the highest
political level.]{.underline} However, its current fragile existence and
the crucial challenges make increased activity and regional consensus
the overriding success criteria. In this light, it may be beneficial if
State Secretary Marco Rubio is not at the table.

### AT -- Perm do Both

#### Perm fails -- unilateral action trades off with the cooperative engagement of the plan

\[Ingeborg, Norwegian peace educator, former director in UNESCO and
former president of the International Peace Bureau/IPB, 2/4/25,

Council -- too important to be squeezed between the great powers!",

accessed 6/13/25\]

[The strong militarization in the Arctic is the elephant in the room in
the Arctic Council]{.underline} as well as in the Norwegian and Nordic
public. [In order for the Arctic Council to be able to meet the
existential environmental challenges, **politicians must contribute to
ensure that the geopolitical conflict lines give way to practical
cooperation.**]{.underline}

[The geopolitical situation in the Arctic has worsened
dramatically]{.underline} by the Swedish and Finnish entry into NATO and
the significant expansion of the number of US bases in the Nordic
countries. And not far from the Norwegian border, Russia has its large
military base on the Kola Peninsula with nuclear submarines and nuclear
weapons.

Bilateral agreements have been signed on 47 American so-called joint
areas in the Nordic countries; Sweden 17, Finland 15 and Denmark 3. In
2023, Norway got four such "joint areas" and in 2024 the government
agreed to a further eight bases, almost without any protests from the
Norwegian parliament.

Through this process, the Nordic countries have become part of a global
network of around 900 American bases in over 80 countries. By
comparison, Russia is considered to have eight bases on foreign soil and
China one. In a short period of time Nordic defence has been
Americanized -- almost without debate. The US has actually taken over
parts of Norway almost to full applause! This in addition to the fact
that Norway for many years has been considered "NATO's eyes and ears in
the North", with sophisticated American surveillance and espionage
installations in the air, on land, at sea and probably also in
cyberspace, allowed over time by shifting governments.

As an example, the new American bases allow the United States to attack
Russia with nuclear weapons without the Nordic countries being aware of
it. A potential war between the United States and Russia could take
place on Norwegian and Nordic soil. Norway disregards Article I of the
Constitution on Norwegian sovereignty as well as the traditional
Norwegian policy that there should be neither foreign bases nor stored
nuclear weapons on Norwegian soil in peacetime. The almost total
servility towards the United States is difficult to understand.

These decisions have only to a modest extent been made known to the
public. Perhaps not even to the majority of the parliament? To the
extent that people in Norway are informed, there is confusion about what
is cooperation with NATO and what is cooperation with the USA. This
confusion is probably intentional. For a long time, the public has been
led to believe that NATO is absolutely essential to Norwegian security.
At the same time, there is concern about the democratic collapse in the
USA. There is reason to believe that people would be much more sceptical
to these new bases if they had known that they were agreed upon on a
bilateral basis between the USA and Norway, initiated by the USA and
with no other connection to NATO than the US NATO dominance.

**[This heavy militarization of the Arctic will not contribute to
increased security]{.underline}**, [as both the Norwegian and the other
Nordic governments preach, **quite the opposite**.]{.underline} The
escalation is by the Russian side considered as a serious threat to
their security. If the security policy goal of the Russian president was
to keep NATO away from the Russian border, he has achieved exactly the
opposite.

### AT -- No Impact

#### Arctic conflict causes extinction.

**Shute '23** \[Joe; September 12; Ph.D. Researcher at Manchester
Metropolitan University; UnHerd, "An Arctic War is Coming,"
https://unherd.com/2023/09/an-arctic-war-is-coming-russia-china/\]

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. [The **era**
of]{.underline} "[Arctic **exceptionalism**]{.underline}" declared by
Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 [is]{.underline} resolutely
**[over]{.underline}**, his [entreaties for]{.underline} the [Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace]{.underline}" free from conflict and
exploitation [forgotten]{.underline}. As climate change accelerates and
Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [**cleaved** apart the
international **order**, [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[emerged
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the potential [[theatre of]{.mark} the next
**[global conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that [the global **race** to
plunder]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} could [have
**devastating** consequences]{.underline}. "If you don't co-operate on
the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll tell you this,
my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

**[Russia]{.underline}**, whose [territory **spans** around 53% of the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [shoreline]{.underline}, and
**[China]{.underline}** are rapidly [developing plans to expand
the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[R]{.underline}**oute. The maritime passage between the east and west
of the Arctic Ocean is regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions. It is already possible to navigate the route for anyone with
several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the mandatory Russian ice
breakers which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the
Kremlin is planning to commence year-round navigations of the route,
through which it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from
around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously [[declared
itself]{.mark} a "**near-[Arctic]{.mark}** [state]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of
the far north, while in March, a Russian delegation to India held talks
over new co-operation over the route. [[The **West**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly [flexing its muscles,]{.underline}
with [Finland]{.underline} (and the expected accession of Sweden)
[[extending **NATO's** borders]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Arctic. In
June, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the US
would be opening an outpost in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø,
stressing the need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic
Circle. "[The war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} has really
[[torpedoed]{.underline}]{.mark} this idea of [[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}," explains Dr Neil Melvin, Director
of International Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
"The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now shifted to
building security against Russia."

As Melvin points out, [the]{.underline} heavy losses [sustained by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s land army in [Ukraine will **force** it
to become [increasingly **reliant** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear force**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stationed [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "[[They]{.mark} will [feel more
**vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of not having a strong
army, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} I think we are likely to see them
[[**threaten** nuclear options]{.underline}]{.mark} much more as part of
national defence," Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They
are going to be much more **explicit** and threatening]{.underline}."

Beneath the ice, the Arctic possesses untold riches. The region is
estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas
reserves and rare earth elements such as gold, nickel and zinc. While
most of these are present within the largely undisputed land borders of
the Arctic nations, it is the [increasingly navigable international
**waters**]{.underline} that [present the most likely
**flashpoint**]{.underline}. An ongoing process led by a United Nations
commission is considering sovereignty rights to the central Arctic Ocean
between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is cooperating with the
process so far, he has also planted a flag in the most literal sense ---
dropping a titanium standard of the Russian Federation two miles beneath
the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007. Fishing rights are also key;
as southern oceans heat up, species will migrate ever further north,
causing estimated catches in higher latitudes to increase by up to 20
per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know we have [potential [**flashpoints** like
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} which, having caused agitation and tension
in the past, might be [**[escalate]{.mark}**d very
**[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from [[attacks on]{.mark} underwater
**[cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was
linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to]{.underline} an outright
[attack on [oil and gas **infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The
Norwegian European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is
most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[be]{.mark} the ultimate **opportunity** for Russia to test
**NATO**'s resolve]{.underline}."

Regardless of the [potential for **[nuclear]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline}, a burning Arctic poses grave threats for
humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland soils which are the
world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands store twice as much
carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns, it releases the
carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a doom loop.
According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, wildfires
across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere
between January and August, more than 25% of the global total for 2023
in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies [the **great
lesson** of]{.underline} the [far north]{.underline}, Professor Dodds
explains: nothing here ever happens in isolation --- [[there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} wider [[**ramifications** across the
**globe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Change in the Arctic is never
restricted to the Arctic itself," he says. "It is almost as if the
Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of [the Arctic]{.underline}
as a great pristine wilderness. Instead it has become the burning
crucible of our climate crisis. But, as the towering glaciers melt and
the seas of the Earth's fifth largest ocean are revealed to us at last,
their future looks even darker still, [reanimating]{.underline} the
[**bio**logical threats]{.underline} of our deep past, and
[providing]{.underline} yet another [site for]{.underline} human
competition and **[conquest]{.underline}**.

### AT -- Arctic Council Fails

#### The Arctic Council works-- all countries are committed to collaboration & its framework is resilient and built to resolve disputes, [even when tensions are high]{.underline}

<https://jordanrussiacenter.org/blog/how-and-why-the-arctic-council-survived-russias-invasion-of-ukraine>,
accessed 6/13/25\]

On 3 March 2022, the seven Western Arctic states issued a joint
statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and temporarily paused
their activities within the Council. This disruption also found place in
other fora like the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, from which Russia
withdrew its participation, and the Council of the Baltic Sea States,
from which Russia was suspended. The discussions within the Arctic
Council at the political level were largely confidential, and did not
always include permanent participants in decision-making processes.

In May 2022, [Norway confirmed that it would proceed with preparations
for its upcoming chairship period despite the ongoing
pause.]{.underline} The following June, [the "Arctic
seven]{.underline}"---the western AC member states---[issued a statement
signaling partial resumption of AC work without Russian
involvement]{.underline}. This action attracted media attention, adding
traction to debates about the Council's prospects, which seemed bleak at
the time. The Arctic Circle Assembly in October 2022 was, however, a
turning point. Among those closely involved with the Arctic Council, the
approach had been to avoid public discussions about its survival to
prevent further speculation as to the body's future. [But after the
Arctic Circle Assembly, leaders deemed it necessary to assert the
Council's relevance and demonstrate the commitment of all Arctic states
to its continued survival.]{.underline}

In November 2022, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei L[avrov invited the
Arctic states to a ministerial meeting to take place in May 2023. Norway
accepted the invitation, signaling its desire for a smooth chairship
transition and the continued existence of the Arctic
Council.]{.underline} The transition of chairship from Russia and Norway
was completed on 11 May 2023, despite challenges and the lack of
in-person participation.

During the transition, Norway outlined its priorities, focusing on
oceans, climate and environment, sustainable development, and the
well-being of northern communities. [Although Russia expressed
conditioned skepticism]{.underline} to the upcoming Norwegian chairship
period, particularly due to the potential influence of NATO in the
Arctic Council---since, indeed, all AC member states except Russia were
now NATO members---**[it did not push for alternative multilateral
platforms.]{.underline}**

After the transition, the body approved new guidelines for resuming
scientific work within the Council's Working Groups. [The collective
efforts of the Arctic states, under Norwegian chairship, have been
crucial in preserving the Council's role during this challenging
period.]{.underline} Despite these gains, however, the future of the
Arctic Council remains uncertain.

Why did the Arctic Council survive?

[We define "survival" as the Arctic Council's ability to continue
functioning,]{.underline} albeit to a limited extent, [with all
participating member states. **All member states have been kept engaged
in ongoing activities to varying degrees, and all member states,
including Russia, have expressed a desire to maintain
cooperation.**]{.underline} This fact, however, does not guarantee the
Council's future stability, much less immunity to external or internal
challenges.

Legal framework

The legal framework of the Arctic Council is rooted in the 1996 Ottawa
Declaration and the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS),
which emphasize consensus-based decision-making among member states.
This framework deliberately avoids military security issues. The Council
lacks the authority to impose sanctions, allowing its working groups to
make clearer recommendations without the constraints of consensus-driven
decision-making. These working groups, some of which predate the Council
itself, have been instrumental in shaping international environmental
policies.

Hence, the Arctic Council is more of a decision-shaping body than a
decision-making one, providing a platform for non-state actors like
indigenous communities to engage in international governance. Norway's
chairship transition in 2023 was made possible through a combination of
established procedural documents and the strategic plan for 2021--2030.
[This strategic reliance on existing frameworks enabled Norway to
navigate diplomatic challenges, ensuring the Council's survival during a
period of geopolitical instability. Yet procedural feasibility alone
does not fully explain the Council's survival.]{.underline}

Strategic framework

Over recent decades, **[global interest in the Arctic has surged, driven
by the region's strategic importance and the growing need for
international cooperation]{.underline}**. **[The AC has played a central
role in facilitating this interest, even during times of high
geopolitical tensions. All AC member states agree that the Arctic
Council is the main forum for multilateral cooperation in the Arctic in
the relevant strategic documents.]{.underline}**

Moreover, [the Arctic Council was created on the assumption that it
would be possible to cooperate with Russia after the dissolution of the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. Indeed, the Council's founding agreement, the
AEPS, was enabled through the Murmansk initiatives articulated by
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.

Foreign policy engagement

**[The Arctic Council has been a central arena for international
cooperation in the region for several reasons.]{.underline}** [First, by
promoting multilateral cooperation through the Council, Arctic states
can counter expansionist ambitions from non-Arctic states and prevent
conflict-driven narratives.]{.underline} [The Council also]{.underline}
serves as a barrier against the establishment of competing regimes,
[reinforcing the legitimacy of frameworks like the Law of the Sea
Convention.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [the Arctic Council's structure, which includes indigenous
peoples' organizations as permanent participants, adds legitimacy and
ensures diverse perspectives in decision-making.]{.underline} The Arctic
Council\'s role in knowledge generation and its established networks
have heightened global awareness of Arctic climate challenges, making
its survival crucial for continued environmental collaboration.

Finally, **[the Council\'s origins in the post-Cold War era and its role
in maintaining regional stability underscore its
importance.]{.underline}** The transition of chairmanship from Russia to
Norway, coupled with the resumption of project-level work, illustrates
the collective determination of the Arctic states to ensure the
Council\'s continued existence, with an open-door policy for Russia's
potential future re-engagement.

#### The Arctic Council works, but the CP is key to ramp up commitments and dialogue

[Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had a seismic effect on
Arctic Council cooperation]{.underline}: The seven other member states
decided to put their work in the Arctic Council on pause, and in the
aftermath, Russia chose to withdraw from the Barents Euro-Arctic Council
while threatening to do the same in the Arctic Council.

**[Since the pause in March 2022, cooperation has gradually been
restarted:]{.underline}** [first in June 2022, when the working group
projects without Russian participation -- approximately 70 out of 140 --
were resumed, and subsequently under the Norwegian chairship, when
**there has been a steady increase**]{.underline} -- though still
limited -- of interactions at the official level as well [as the
resumption of more substantial cooperation in the six working
groups.]{.underline}

The new regional realities have also changed Russia's approach to
China's Arctic ambitions. Whereas Moscow was previously skeptical about
welcoming Beijing into Arctic governance, it is now more open and
approachable. We have seen this concretely in increased economic
cooperation, remarkable coast guard cooperation and joint statements
from Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin about wanting to strengthen
cooperation in the Arctic.

If we look to the west, there are also dark clouds on the horizon, which
portend another challenge for the Arctic Council: Donald Trump's USA.
During President Trump's first term, we saw how then-Secretary of State,
Mike Pompeo, spoke harshly against China and Russia, and did not share
the other member states' view that human activities are the main driver
behind climate change and pose an existential threat. This resulted in
the Finnish chairship failing to conclude a joint declaration in 2019,
which was the first time in the history of the Arctic Council.

Donald Trump's persistent interest in Greenland may also prove to be a
serious challenge for the chairship during the next two years. While the
threat, on the one hand, may bring Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands closer together, there is also an increased risk of American
attempts to create discord in the realm. Thus, Denmark, Greenland and
the Faroe Islands are under a historically high cross-pressure, which
transforms the chairship from being a big task to an enormous one.

**[The need for increased council activity]{.underline}**

[**Norway's chairship in 2023-2025 has managed to balance the situation
and keep the council alive by gradually ramping up its activitie**s. For
the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroese chairship to be a success, it would
be wise to continue on the same path with steadily increasing activity
to ensure that the council's pulse continues to beat.]{.underline}
However, the fact that the threat now both comes from the east and the
west makes the balancing act historically difficult.

One opportunity for increasing activity is to further enhance the focus
on the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic -- which the new
chairship program, indeed, prioritizes -- in order to strengthen
regional cooperation without necessarily having to compromise on
condemning Russia. If the situation allows, something as ambitious as a
binding agreement on increased protection of Indigenous peoples' rights
in the Arctic would be worth striving for, similar to the council's
three existing agreements on aeronautical and maritime search and rescue
(2011), marine oil pollution preparedness and response (2013), and
enhancing international Arctic scientific cooperation (2017).

It may not sound like something Trump would want a stake in, but there
is a chance that the Arctic Council does not have his attention
whatsoever due to its limited activity -- and because there are plenty
of other things that keep him occupied. If that is the case, it may
actually prove to be an advantage for the Arctic Council, which under
normal circumstances would otherwise strengthen its relevance if
meetings were prioritized by the highest political level. However, its
current fragile existence and the crucial challenges make increased
activity and regional consensus the overriding success criteria. In this
light, it may be beneficial if State Secretary Marco Rubio is not at the
table.

The chairship's level of ambition is therefore closely linked to how
relations with Russia in the east and the US in the west unfold in the
coming period, and here it is extra important that the other member
states stand together. [Only in this way can we ensure that the Arctic
Council continues to exist so that regional environmental problems and
sustainable development are not overshadowed by military rumble and
great power competition.]{.underline}

#### The Arctic Council is still functioning -- all countries are committed to collaboration but increased engagement is needed

accessed 6/13/25\]

On 3 March 2022, the seven Western Arctic states issued a joint
statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and temporarily paused
their activities within the Council. This disruption also found place in
other fora like the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, from which Russia
withdrew its participation, and the Council of the Baltic Sea States,
from which Russia was suspended. The discussions within the Arctic
Council at the political level were largely confidential, and did not
always include permanent participants in decision-making processes.

In May 2022, [Norway confirmed that it would proceed with preparations
for its upcoming chairship period despite the ongoing
pause.]{.underline} The following June, [the "Arctic
seven]{.underline}"---the western AC member states---[issued a statement
signaling partial resumption of AC work without Russian
involvement]{.underline}. This action attracted media attention, adding
traction to debates about the Council's prospects, which seemed bleak at
the time. The Arctic Circle Assembly in October 2022 was, however, a
turning point. Among those closely involved with the Arctic Council, the
approach had been to avoid public discussions about its survival to
prevent further speculation as to the body's future. [But after the

#### The Arctic Council is [cooked]{.underline} -- Trump, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and distrust [zero]{.underline} CP solvency

**Coffey, Hudson Institute senior fellow, 5/16/25**

\[Luke, Arab News, "How a big freeze descended on the Arctic Council",
<https://www.arabnews.com/node/2601027>, accessed 6/13/25\]

With much of the world's attention focused on US President Donald
Trump's historic visit to the Middle East or the fluctuating progress of
talks between Russia and Ukraine, a quiet but consequential event took
place last week that largely escaped notice.

In Norway, relatively low-level officials gathered for a closed-door
ceremony to mark the transfer of the Arctic Council's two-year rotating
chairmanship from Norway to Denmark. This may seem mundane. In fact it
was an important moment for one of the world's few remaining forums
where East and West, until recently, found ways to cooperate.

[The council, established]{.underline} in 1996, brings together the
eight Arctic states --- Canada, Denmark (through Greenland), Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the US --- [to collaborate on
non-military issues. For years, it functioned effectively by focusing on
practical, low-conflict areas such as environmental protection, search
and rescue coordination, and oil spill response.]{.underline}

[This pragmatic approach allowed the council to thrive, even during
periods of broader geopolitical tension.]{.underline} Crucially, it also
includes six indigenous organizations as permanent participants, giving
the peoples who live in the Arctic a direct voice in shaping its future.
[Observer states, including faraway Singapore and major players such as
China, contribute expertise and funding, but have no vote.]{.underline}

**[This system worked --- until it didn't.]{.underline}**

**[The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 shattered many
channels of cooperation between Moscow and the West, including the
Arctic Council.]{.underline}** Although Russia handed over the
chairmanship to Norway in May of that year, the customary fanfare was
noticeably absent. **[Over the past two years Norway has tried to keep
the council afloat, but the breakdown in relations with Russia rendered
it largely ineffective.]{.underline}** By the time Norway passed the
chairmanship to Denmark, the best that could be said was that the
council still existed.

[Complicating matters further are suggestions by **Trump that the US
might seek to annex Greenland and an unwillingness to rule out military
force to do so, which have alarmed NATO allies and unsettled the Arctic
Council's delicate balance.**]{.underline} That may explain why it was
Greenland's foreign minister, rather than a Danish official, who
accepted the chairmanship on Denmark's behalf. [How this tension between
the US and Denmark plays out within the council remains to be seen, but
**it will not make cooperation any easier.**]{.underline}

**[With the council unable to conduct substantial work, its immediate
goal is simply to survive.]{.underline}** Should a ceasefire or peace
agreement be reached in Ukraine, some might push to quickly revive the
council, but they would face serious headwinds. [Since 2022, the Arctic
security landscape has changed profoundly. Norway's newly released
national security strategy describes its situation as "the most serious
\... our country has faced since the Second World War."]{.underline}

[Finland and Sweden, previously militarily non-aligned, have joined
NATO]{.underline}, placing seven of the eight Arctic states under the
same security umbrella. [Their accession to the alliance would have been
unimaginable before Russia's invasion.]{.underline} [The new Canadian
government is expanding its presence in the Arctic, for geopolitical
reasons that are unlikely to disappear anytime soon: **Russia's actions
in Ukraine have left deep scars.**]{.underline}

This evolving environment also affects non-Arctic states seeking a
larger role in the region. China, for example, has been one of the major
losers of the Arctic Council's dysfunction. Beijing used the forum to
expand influence in polar affairs. With the council no longer
functioning as it once did, China has lost a key international venue. In
response, Russia and China have deepened their cooperation in the
Arctic, particularly on energy and infrastructure projects, driven
partly by Western sanctions.

If the Arctic Council does eventually resume full operations, expect
China to re-engage quickly to regain lost ground.

Another unresolved challenge concerns indigenous representation. Among
the six permanent indigenous participants is the Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North. However, many indigenous Russians have
fled the country and formed exile organizations, such as the
International Committee of Indigenous Peoples of Russia. These groups
seek a seat at the Arctic Council table, but so far no effort has been
made to include them. Moscow would undoubtedly veto any attempt to do
so. If the council hopes to rebuild credibility, it cannot return to
business as usual while excluding exiled indigenous voices. Navigating
this will be tricky, but necessary.

[Has the damage to trust between Russia and its Arctic neighbors gone
too far for the council to recover? It's too early to say, **but it
cannot be ruled out.**]{.underline}

Also, that the Arctic is thousands of kilometers from the Middle East
doesn't mean it's irrelevant to this region. With key shipping lanes in
the Red Sea threatened by Houthi attacks and piracy concerns persisting
off the Horn of Africa, global shipping companies are eyeing new trade
routes between Asia and Europe. Depending on how rapidly Arctic ice
continues to melt, northern sea routes may become increasingly viable.

Moreover, scientific research in the Arctic --- especially on climate
and environmental change --- is of global importance. Countries such as
the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already shown interest in Arctic research
and investment. Both have sent delegations to Arctic conferences and
expressed willingness to fund scientific initiatives. As the region
becomes more accessible and geopolitically important, Arab engagement is
likely to grow.

[What happens in the Arctic is often shaped by geopolitical currents
elsewhere, and increasingly what happens in the Arctic has consequences
across the globe. While the headlines may focus on more immediate
crises, the Arctic deserves attention. We ignore it at our
peril.]{.underline}

#### Arctic Council can't solve Arctic War... or anything else!

**Huebert, University of Calgary political science professor, 3/3/25**

\[Rob, ArcticToday,"Can the Arctic Council survive the Trump
administration? Probably not. Here's why",
<https://www.arctictoday.com/can-the-arctic-council-survive-the-trump-administration-probably-not-heres-why/>,
accessed 6/13/25\]

[The havoc caused by the new American administration has been
devastating on a wide range of fronts. We are quite possibly witnessing
the end of the western rules-based international order that has lasted
since the end of World War II.]{.underline}

[While Trump's attention hasn't yet shifted to the Arctic Council, it
**should be apparent to all that this is just a matter of time. When he
does, the outcomes will be devastating.** He will probably take three
steps that will combine to **either gut the key works of the Council, or
possibly end it altogether.**]{.underline}

[First, Trump's elimination of international aid demonstrates his policy
of selfish isolationism.]{.underline} [His decision to stop much of the
assistance provided under the USAID program shows that he has no
inclination to understand the benefits of a cooperative multilateral
system, or a desire to continue a policy that every U.S. president since
Kennedy has supported.]{.underline}

In addition, [he has openly criticized NATO and the ICC, along with many
of the U.S. economic agreements with other nations.]{.underline} In both
his first term and now his second, Trump has shown a clear lack of
support for international organizations and multilateral agreements.
[Specifically, he seems intent on either ending American participation
or upending the agreements solely for American benefit.]{.underline}

[Trump has already demonstrated that even if he doesn't withdraw from
the Arctic Council, he would actively gut some of the most important
achievements in line with his own goals]{.underline}. First, he doesn't
"believe" in climate change. [During Trump's first term, the Arctic
Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019 failed to produce a
final declaration for the first time since the organization was created.
This was because the U.S. delegation -- under the leadership of
Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- objected to the term "climate change"
or any reference to the Paris Accord.]{.underline} There is nothing to
suggest that the American position on climate change will be altered. If
anything, it will probably get more strident.

Reshaping Society

Trump has also moved quickly to end American programs that are in any
way associated with the issues surrounding Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI). It is highly unlikely that as part of this process to
reshape American society, his administration would support any of the
important initiatives supporting the northern Indigenous Peoples under
the Arctic Council. [His administration has had no qualms about ending
the support that the U.S. had provided to the developing world, so he
will almost certainly be unwilling to continue to provide any support of
the Permanent Participants or any of the Arctic Council programs that
support them.]{.underline}

Third, **[Trump has directly attacked two of the core state members of
the Arctic Council.]{.underline}** [Since his second term began, he has
repeatedly threatened to "take over" both Greenland and Canada. While
some at first thought he was just joking, Trump has continued to say
that these are his intentions.]{.underline} He has begun to take active
steps, through the threats of a trade war to critically weaken Canada in
order to make it more amendable to "joining" the U.S. Again, [even if he
doesn't move to directly destroy the Arctic Council, how could Canada
and Denmark work with the U.S., knowing that the Americans are actively
moving to weaken or even cripple them as a state?]{.underline}

Fourth, the [one Arctic state that Trump has attempted to improve
relations with -- Russia -- remains also problematic for the Arctic
Council. Trump's effort to work with Russia will make the existing
issues that the Arctic Council had with Russia even more
difficult.]{.underline} Trump has already called for the Russians to be
readmitted to the G-7. [If he doesn't move to end the Arctic Council, he
will undoubtedly call for any sanctions against Russia to be eliminated
and for the country to be fully integrated.]{.underline}

At the same time [he is actively moving to directly be involved in
assisting Russia to complete its conquest of Ukraine.]{.underline} In a
move that is reminiscent of the conquest of Czechoslovakia through the
capitulation of the U.K. and France to Germany in 1938, [Trump has begun
direct negotiations with Russia without the involvement of the
Ukrainians. Putin now knows that it has the support of
Trump.]{.underline}

As a result, there is every reason to believe that Russia will continue
with its acts of aggression against its neighbours. This includes both
Sweden and Finland, who both chose to join NATO. Putin has always made
it clear that it was the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO that was
one of the reasons for his decision to launch his war of aggression
against Ukraine in 2014.

Scorched Earth Policy

**[Ultimately, this means that the Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios.]{.underline}** **[The first is that in his scorched earth
policy toward multilateralism, Trump will either move to end the Arctic
Council or at least remove the U.S. as a member.]{.underline}** [He may
also carry out his threat to ensure that both Canada and Denmark also
cease to be meaningful members of the Arctic Council.]{.underline} If he
truly does intend to take over Canada, it won't even be a state. [Even
if he only means to weaken and reduce Canada to a vassal state, its
ability to participate will be damaged -- if not
eliminated.]{.underline}

Likewise, [if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated.]{.underline}
Assuming that somehow the Arctic Council survives an American
withdrawal, and the U.S. follows up its threats to control Greenland and
Canada, the Council would have only the active membership of Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Iceland.

**[Even if the U.S. remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions
means the gutting of some of its most important missions,]{.underline}**
[The U.S. won't support actions to eliminate the causes of climate
change, and it is very unlikely to support the Permanent Participants.
Outside of the Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But
even here Trump is having an impact. **He has already fired Admiral
Linda Pagan, the Commandant of the USCG.** American officials have
suggested it was because of her commitment to DEI policies.]{.underline}

Even more dangerously, [this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council.]{.underline} It would also include a Denmark that
has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action to
prevent this. [It will include a Canada that is being continually
weakened by American action, and is either actively trying to stop an
American takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S. It will also
include a Russia that is being increasingly supported by the U.S. and
has been given the right of conquest over Ukraine.]{.underline}
[Furthermore, if Ukraine was conquered for considering joining NATO, the
future of both Finland and Sweden (which did actually join NATO) will
undoubtedly be even more problematic for Russia.]{.underline}

**[These are dire times for the Arctic Council. It is hard to think of a
way to maintain its many successes in supporting an understanding of the
impact of climate change on the Arctic]{.underline}**. It has also
played an important role in supporting a greater awareness of the
northern Indigenous Peoples in the region. And perhaps most importantly,
it has served as the principal means of promoting a peaceful and
harmonious international regime of cooperation.

**[All of this is now at risk.]{.underline}** Perhaps Trump won't think
that the Arctic Council is worth his attention, and it can somehow
remain under the American radar until the next presidential election.
But as many have said in the past, hope is not a strategy.
