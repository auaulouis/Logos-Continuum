# Violations

### Substantial -- 50%

#### Interpretation - Substantial means at least 50% change

Change in selected pressures on natural ecosystems 2002-32. For the
ecosystem quality component, see the explanation of the Natural Capital
Index. Values for the cumulative pressures were derived as described
under Natural Capital Index. [The maps show the relative increase or
decrease in pressure between 2002 and 2032. \'No change\' means less
than 10 per cent change in pressure over the scenario period; small
increase or decrease means between 10 and 50 per cent change;
**substantial increase** or decrease **means 50 to 100 per cent
change**; strong increase means more than doubling of pressure. Areas
which switch between natural and domesticated land uses are recorded
separately.]{.underline}

#### Current funding for Arctic exploration and development is \$446 million -- that means substantial must be at least \$223.00 million -- we'll insert this table!

#### Violation -- The aff does not increase funding by \$223 million dollars.

#### Vote Neg - 

#### 1. Limits: Our interpretation is key to limit small affs that do not fund more than 223 million dollars. Their interpretation explodes affirmative ground by opening the floodgates to small funding change affirmatives.

#### 2. Ground: Their interpretation of substantial makes the neg lose core negative arguments like economy da's, sphere of influence da's, and politics da's.

### Its -- No Private Actors

#### Interpretation -- Its refers to the United States Federal Government

#### Violation -- The aff does not increase USFG development and/or exploration of the Arctic because it relies on the private sector and NGO's!

#### Vote Neg -- 

#### Limits: Our interpretation prevents an explosion of affs that mix private and public enterprises for solvency. They open the floodgates to infinite private company affs.

#### Ground: Private sector CP is neg ground! They also spike links to DA's and K's premised on federal action.

#### Extra T: The aff gets advantages based on non-governmental organizations.

### Development -- Not Conservation/Sustainable

#### Interpretation - Development is distinct from conservation -- environmental affs are "sustainable development" which is distinct from "development"

Few concepts are as contested as '[development']{.underline}. It [can
have economic, political, or social implications, but in most cases
**connotes progress or improvement.**]{.underline}

**[And then there is the concept of 'sustainable
development']{.underline}**, which has found substantial currency in the
Arctic region, even consisting of one of the Arctic Council's two
mandates. **[It adds an environmental caveat to the concept of
development, contending that progress only happens if there isn't a
permanent environmental cost to it.]{.underline}**

#### Violation -- The aff is conservation and/or sustainable development which is distinct from development.

#### Vote Neg

#### 1. Limits: Their interpretation explodes limits by making the topic bidirectional because affs can claim they increase development OR decrease standard development practices such as resource extraction through sustainable development ie conservation. Doubles the number of affs we have to be prepared to debate.

#### 2. Ground: Sustainable development obfuscates core neg environment DA's.

### Exploration/Development - Must Be for Resources

#### Interpretation -- Exploration and development are tied to resources -- searching and extracting

**US Code, 14**

\(k\) Exploration.-[The term \"**exploration**\" means the **process of
searching for minerals**, including (1) geophysical surveys where
magnetic, gravity, seismic, or other systems are used to detect or imply
the presence of such minerals, and (2) any drilling, whether on or off
known geological structures, including the drilling of a well in which a
discovery of oil or natural gas in paying quantities is made and the
drilling of any additional delineation well after such discovery which
is needed to delineate any reservoir and to enable the lessee to
determine whether to proceed with development and
production.]{.underline}

\(l\) **[Development]{.underline}**.-The term \"development\" [**means
those activities which take place following discovery of minerals in
paying quantities**, including geophysical activity, drilling, platform
construction, and operation of all onshore support facilities, and which
are for the purpose of ultimately producing the minerals
discovered.]{.underline}

#### Violation -- The aff does not search for or develop minerals

#### Vote Neg

#### 1. Limits: Affs outside of resource discussions make it impossible to be negative -- infinite number of explorative or development goals with infinite amounts of permutations between the two. Resource focus is predictive and still allows for aff innovation and different mechanisms.

#### 2. Ground: Exploration or development of non-resources guts stable link arguments.

### Exploration -- Requires Human Presence

#### Interpretation -- Exploration requires human presence

What, then, is exploration? [Exploration is a human activity, undertaken
by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons; it has
components of national interest, scientific research, and technical
innovation but is defined exclusively by none of them.]{.underline}26 We
**[define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human
experience---that is, bringing people into new places, situations, and
environments, and expanding and redefining what it means to be
human]{.underline}**. Exploration in the context of space activity
addresses a number of key questions, such as: what is the role of the
Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the Earth?
Could it survive without the planet?

Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story
that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a
moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the
nature and meaning of human life. **[Exploration by this definition can
be accomplished only by direct human presence and may be deemed worthy
of the risk of human life]{.underline}**. "Ships \[of discovery\] must
voyage into a moral universe that explains who a people are and how they
should behave, that criticizes and justifies both the sustaining society
and those it encounters."27

#### Violation -- The aff only expands the use of technology in the Arctic -- does not expand human presence means it's not exploration.

#### Vote Neg

#### Limits: Their interpretation justifies exploration of the week affs that deploy tiny or inconsequential tech to the Arctic. Human involvement requires

[A country of central and northwest North America with coastlines on the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans]{.underline}. It includes the noncontiguous
states of Alaska and Hawaii and various island territories in the
Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The area now occupied by the contiguous
48 states was originally inhabited by numerous Native American peoples
and was colonized beginning in the 16th century by Spain, France, the
Netherlands, and England. Great Britain eventually controlled most of
the Atlantic coast and, after the French and Indian Wars (1754-1763),
the Northwest Territory and Canada. The original Thirteen Colonies
declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 and formed a
government under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, adopting (1787)
a new constitution that went into effect after 1789. The nation soon
began to expand westward. Growing tensions over the issue of Black
slavery divided the country along geographic lines, sparking the
secession of the South and the Civil War (1861-1865). The remainder of
the 19th century was marked by increased westward expansion,
industrialization, and the influx of millions of immigrants. The United
States entered World War II after the Japanese attack (1941) on Pearl
Harbor and emerged after the war as a world power. Washington, D.C., is
the capital and New York the largest city. Population: 302,000,000.

Introduction

The United States of America is a democracy, which means it is governed
by the will of its people. Its government provides a system of
management for American citizens. Established in 1789, [the **U**nited
**S**tates is a federal republic]{.underline}, with a strong democratic
tradition. Its legal system is based on English common law. [The
government is divided into separate governing units. At the top level is
the Federal Government]{.underline}, which provides functions that are
best managed by a centralized government, such as defense, currency
regulation, and foreign relations. Its capital city is Washington, D.C.

Federal Government

At the Federal level, there are three branches of government: executive,
legislative, and judicial. These branches work in concert under a set of
checks and balances that ensure a relatively even distribution of
authority and power.

**[USFG = National Government]{.underline}**

**'Federal government' means the national government**

Lumen Learning, **Lumen 19**, "The Division of Powers",
https://courses.lumenlearning.com/openstax-americangovernment/chapter/the-division-of-powers/

Modern democracies divide governmental power in two general ways; some,
like the United States, use a combination of both structures. The first
and more common mechanism shares power among three branches of
government---the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The
second, federalism, apportions power between two levels of government:
national and subnational. [In the **U**nited **S**tates, the term
federal government refers to the government at the national level, while
the term states means governments at the subnational level]{.underline}.

**They're synonyms**

Commonwealth of **Virginia 19** Department of Education, "Virginia State
and Local Civic Education Module -- Civic Education -- Federalism",
http://www.civiceducationva.org/federalism2.php

Did You Know? Federalism is a system of government in which power is
divided between a national government and other regional political
structures such as states or provinces. [While the United States has a
federal system of government, it is important to remember that the term
"federal government" is used as a synonym for the national
government]{.underline}. Other governmental power structures that exist
are unitary and confederal (confederation). In a unitary system of
government, the power to govern (and delegate administrative authority)
is held by a national (central) government. In a confederal system of
government, typically a union or league of independent states retain
their sovereignty/power but may delegate a central government or
administrative unit to work on common issues or concerns for the benefit
of all members.

## Should

**[Should = Mandatory]{.underline}**

**'Should' is mandatory**

Judge Henry **Nieto 9**, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009 People v.
Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s
or commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty**
or **obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

**'Should' means must, opposed to 'could', which means mere
[capability]{.underline} or 'might'**

Judge **Eager 69**, Supreme Court of Missouri, Division One, 6-9-1969,
Burrell v. Mayfair-Lennox Hotels, Inc., 442 S.W.2d 47 (Mo. 1969)

In the briefs both parties rely largely upon definitions, both from
dictionaries and cases. We refrain from quoting \[\*\*21\] or discussing
these specifically. [In **ordinary parlance** the word \"should\"
imports an idea of **obligation**; it is the past tense of \"shall\"
which implies \"owes, ought to, must\"]{.underline} (Webster\'s 3rd
Internat. Dict.). Defendant\'s counsel seem to recognize this meaning.
They further concede that [\"**could\"** denotes **mere \"capability\"**
and is often used as meaning **\"might.\"**]{.underline} The dictionary
generally confirms the meaning as denoting a mere ability to do or make.
Counsel further argue that the use of \"should\" thus imposed a greater
burden upon the defendant. We wholly fail to follow that argument. The
instruction, as we see it, required the plaintiff to demonstrate to the
jury by its evidence that defendant was obligated to know of the
defective condition, and not merely to demonstrate that it would have
been possible (or within its ability) to do so. Thus, in the
common-sense meaning of the language used, the plaintiff and not the
defendant bore a greater burden from the deviation. It seems possible
that defendant thinks that the instruction tells the jury that defendant
was obligated to know of the defect. Such is not true. It simply told
the jury that before it could find \[\*\*22\] for the plaintiff it must
find that, under the circumstances, defendant was obligated to know of
it. Our view as to where the additional burden was cast seems to be
confirmed in the case of Thompson v. Quincy, O. & K.C.R. Co., Mo., 18
S.W.2d 401.

**'Should' means must\-\--its mandatory**

**Foresi 32** Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used
with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express obligation,
necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be carried
out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense that the
word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When the
judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from all
the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of
the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\' is **not
used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of \'must\', or
\'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it the sense
of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in
direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away, or
nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect the
welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

million), women's leadership capacity (\$15 million), the International
Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment

**'Should' isn't binding**

George **Dvorsky 15**, Gizmodo, A Single Typo Nearly Killed the Paris
Climate Accord, 12/14/15,
gizmodo.com/a-single-typo-nearly-killed-the-paris-climate-accord-1747908970

[Hours before the]{.underline} historic [Paris climate
accord]{.underline} was to be ratified in a final vote, someone noticed
that a word had been changed in the final draft of the text---[a
**single word** that threatened to derail the entire deal]{.underline}.
As reported in the Washington Post, [someone changed the word "should"
to "shall."]{.underline} Now, it seems like a little thing, but
[given]{.underline} that [the words were in reference to]{.underline}
sweeping new [legal]{.underline} and financial [obligations, **it
mattered. A lot.** When it comes to **legally binding terminology**,
there's a **big difference** between "should" and "shall." Whereas
"should" is a kind of wishy-washy call to action, the word "shall"
implies an obligation]{.underline}, and this is why Secretary of State
John Kerry could not abide the unexpected change. The New York Times
reports: Throughout the process, [the longer and **less binding**
"should" was a **deliberate** part of the international
agreement]{.underline}, put there to establish that the richest
countries, including the United States, felt obligated to pony up money
to help poor countries adapt to climate change and make the transition
to sustainable energy systems. "Shall" meant something altogether
different, American officials said. When "shall" was spotted in the
document on Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry called his French
counterpart and made it clear that unless a switch was made, France
could not count on American support for the agreement. "I said: 'We
cannot do this and we will not do this. And either it changes, or
President Obama and the United States will not be able to support this
agreement,' " Mr. Kerry told reporters after delegates had accepted the
deal by consensus Saturday night, amid cheering and the celebratory
stamping of feet. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed, and within hours
the wording within the 31-page text was reverted back to the original
"should." A subsequent vote affirmed the Paris Accord, and all was
saved.

**'Should' means desirable\-\--this does not have to be a mandate**

**AC 99** Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html

shall

[\'shall\' describes something that is mandatory]{.underline}. If a
requirement uses \'shall\', then that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied
without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one
single \'shall\' is sufficient reason to reject the entire product.
Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. Examples: \#
\"Requirements shall make use of the word \'shall\' only where
compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example. \# \"C++ code shall
have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example. Using \'shall\'
here is too strong.

should

[\'should\' is weaker. It describes something that might not be
satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable
enough]{.underline} that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

**'Should' doesn't require certainty**

[Should]{.underline}. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying duty
or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of propriety
or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing it from
"ought." It is not normally synonymous with "may," and although often
interchangeable with the word "would," it [**does not ordinarily express

omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the

In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the

abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a

OF APPEALS OF IOWA 2008 Iowa App. LEXIS 287 May 14, 2008, Filed, lexis

Clyde\'s will provides, \"in the event any of my children should
predecease me leaving issue who survive me, then the share of such
predeceased child shall go in equal shares to his or her issue who
survive me, per stirpes.\" We find no error in the district court\'s
conclusion  \[\*6\] that an intent to avoid the application of the
antilapse statute is not \"clear and explicit\" from the terms of the
will. The will states \"in the event\" Clyde was predeceased by a child,
when in fact Clyde had been predeceased by two of his children at the
time the will was written. If the will was referring to the children who
had already predeceased Clyde, there would be no need to say \"in the
event.\" By stating \"in the event\" it is clear Clyde was looking ahead
to possible future events, when one of his children who were alive when
the will was written might predecease him.

phrase \"in the event any of my children should predecease me\" [and

If a new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets, the value
of the old loss corporation must be reduced by the amount of the
nonbusiness assets less liabilities attributable to those assets.
[\"Substantial\" is defined as **one-third** of total
assets.]{.underline} This is a difficult provision to interpret. IRC
section 382(1)(4) provides that a value reduction in the old loss
corporation is required if, just after an ownership change, the new loss
corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets. This language seems odd
because the purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent loss trafficking,
so it would seem that the asset test ought to apply to the old loss
corporation.

**[Quantitative Defs Good]{.underline}**

**'Substantial' must be assigned [quantitative]{.underline} meaning**

Appeals, Pomerance v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co. of Am., 288 Ga. App. 491,
494-95, 654 S.E.2d 638, 640-42,2007 (Westlaw)

Bearing these principles in mind, we must first determine whether the
policy language **\*\*641** at issue is clear and unambiguous.^2^ We
conclude that it is not. As noted, the Policies defined total disability
as "the inability to perform thematerial and substantial duties of \[the
insured\'s\] occupation." [On the one hand, "substantial" can have a
**qualitative** meaning and be defined as "important" or
"essential.]{.underline}" See Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com /dictionary/substantial. [On the other hand, "substantial" can have
a **quantitative** meaning and be defined as "considerable in quantity"
or "significantly great" in amount.]{.underline} See id. Because
"substantial" is susceptible of two alternative meanings, the definition
of total disability is rendered ambiguous. Under one reading, an insured
is totally disabled if he cannot perform his important
and material duties; however, under the alternative reading, an insured
is totally disabled if he cannot perform a significantly great amount of
his material duties.

6 [As such]{.underline}, [we must]{.underline} apply the rules
of contract construction in an effort to [resolve the
ambiguity]{.underline}. See Hurst, 266 Ga. at 716(4), 470 S.E.2d 659. If
"substantial" is treated as qualitative in meaning and thus is defined
as "important" or "essential," its meaning would be interchangeable with
the meaning of "material," a term that also is used in the definition of
"total disability" under the Policies. See Black\'s Law Dictionary (6th
ed. 1990), p. 1428 (pointing out that "substantial" can be
"\[s\]ynonymous with material"); Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary,[http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com/dictionary/material (defining "material" as "having real importance
or great consequences"). But, it is a cardinal rule of contract
construction "that a court should, if possible, construe a contract so
as not to render any of its provisions meaningless" and in a manner that
gives effect to all of the contractual terms. VATACS Group v. HomeSide
Lending, 276 Ga.App. 386, 389(1), 623 S.E.2d 534 (2005). See also Tyson
v. McPhail Properties, 223 Ga.App. 683, 689(6), 478 S.E.2d 467 (1996)
(finding that the contract "would not have used two different terms in
two sequential paragraphs to describe the same thing"). As such, in
order to avoid rendering the term "material" as mere surplusage, [we
**must construe**]{.underline} \*495 [the term "substantial" as having
the quantitative meaning of "considerable in quantity" or "significantly
great" in amount]{.underline}. See Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com /dictionary/substantial.\
7 When "substantial" is treated as distinct from the term "material" and
thus as qualitative in meaning, it is clear that an insured is totally
disabled under the Policies when he is unable to perform a significantly
great amount (i.e., most or a vast majority) of the material duties of
his occupation. Notably, this interpretation of the total disability
definition comports with that of several foreign jurisdictions that have
interpreted insurance policies containing similar language. See Giddens
v. Equitable Life Assurance etc., 445 F.3d 1286, 1296-1301(II)(D)(2)
(11th Cir.2006); Dowdle v. Nat. Life Ins. Co., 407 F.3d 967, 970(II)
(8th Cir.2005); Gladstone v. Provident Life, etc., Ins. Co., No.
1:05-CV-2868-CC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63233 ([N.D.Ga](http://n.d.ga/).
Aug. 17, 2007); Gross v. UnumProvident Life Ins. Co., 319 F.Supp.2d
1129, 1136(III)(A) (C.D.Cal.2004).3\
\*\*642 8 In reaching this conclusion, we reject Berkshire\'s argument
that the residual disability rider, when read in conjunction with the
total disability provision, requires that total disability be defined as
the inability of the insured to perform all of the material duties of
his occupation. Rather, [we conclude that the language of the rider can
be read in a manner consistent with the definition]{.underline} of total
disability [as the inability to perform]{.underline} **[*most* or
a *vast majority*]{.underline}** [of the material duties of the
insured\'s occupation]{.underline}. The rider defines residual
disability as the "inability to do one or more of \[the insured\'s\]
important daily business or professional duties." The rider, when read
in conjunction with the definition of total disability, creates "a
continuum of disability."

In reversing a summary judgment of invalidity, [the U.S. Court of
Appeals]{.underline} for the Federal Circuit [found that the district
court,]{.underline} by failing to look beyond the intrinsic claim
construction evidence to consider what a person of skill in the art
would understand in a \"technologic context,\" [**erroneously
concluded** the term \"substantially\" made a claim fatally
indefinite.]{.underline}  Verve, LLC v. Crane Cams, Inc., Case No.
01-1417 (Fed. Cir. November 14, 2002). The patent in suit related to an
improved push rod for an internal combustion engine.  The patent claims
a hollow push rod whose overall diameter is larger at the middle than at
the ends and has \"substantially constant wall thickness\" throughout
the rod and rounded seats at the tips.  The district court found that
the expression \"substantially constant wall thickness\" was not
supported in the specification and prosecution history by a sufficiently
clear definition of \"substantially\" and was, therefore, indefinite. 
The district court recognized that the use of the term \"substantially\"
may be definite in some cases but ruled that in this case it was
indefinite because it was not further defined. The Federal Circuit
reversed, concluding that the district court erred in requiring that the
meaning of the term \"substantially\" in a particular \"technologic
context\" be found solely in intrinsic evidence:  \"While reference to
intrinsic evidence is primary in interpreting claims, the criterion is
the meaning of words as they would be understood by persons in the field
of the invention.\"  Thus, [the Federal Circuit instructed that
\"resolution of any ambiguity]{.underline} arising from the claims and
specification [may be aided by]{.underline} extrinsic [evidence of
usage]{.underline} and meaning of a term in the context of the
invention.\"  The Federal Circuit remanded the case to the district

latitude of meaning where it is applied to such subject as thickness, as
by requiring two parts of a device to be substantially the same

2.8. Legal writers who follow the economic value criterion have
generally quantified the term \"substantial part\" by comparing Article
3(1) CISG (substantial) with Article 3(2) CISG (preponderant):
substantial being less than preponderant. In this way, [legal writers
have used the following percentages to quantify substantial:
15%]{.underline},[\[14\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#14) [between
40% and
50%]{.underline},[\[15\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#15) [or
more generally
50]{.underline}%.[\[16\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#16) At
the same time, other authors, although they have not fixed any numbers
in regard to the quantification of the term \"substantial\" have
declared that \"preponderant\" means \"considerably more than 50% of the
price\" or \"clearly in excess of
50%\".[\[17\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#17) Thus
it seems that for the latter authors, the quantification of the term
\"substantial\" is placed above the 50% figure. Also, some Courts have
followed this
approach.[\[18\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#18)

2.9. [To consider a fixed percentage might be **arbitrary** due to the
fact that the particularities of each case ought to be taken into
account; that the scholars are in disagreement; and that the origin of
those figures is not
clear]{.underline}.[\[19\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#19)

[Therefore,]{.underline} [it does not seem to be advisable to quantify
the word \"substantial\" *a priori* in percentages. **A case-by-case
analysis is preferable** and thus it should be determined on the basis
of an overall assessment]{.underline}.

In *Victor*, the trial court instructed that: \"A reasonable doubt is an
actual and substantial doubt . . . as distinguished from a doubt arising
from mere  \[\*64\]  possibility, from bare imagination, or from
fanciful conjecture.\" Victor argued on appeal after receiving the death
penalty that equating a reasonable doubt with a \"substantial doubt\"
overstated the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal. [Although the
court agreed that the instruction was problematic given that
\"substantial,\" could be defined as \"that specified to a large
degree,\" it also ruled that **any ambiguity was removed by reading the
phrase in the context** of the sentence in which it
appeared]{.underline}. Finding such an explicit distinction between a
substantial doubt and a fanciful conjecture was not present in
the *Cage* instruction, it held that the context makes clear that
\"substantial\" was used in the sense of existence rather than in
magnitude of the doubt and, therefore, it was not unconstitutional
as applied. [*Id. at

credit extension activities as substantial due in part to the resources
that must be extended to engage in those activities. In addition, you
assert that the relevant foreign financial authorities view these

such activities. In determining whether a foreign bank derives \"a

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off**.  What may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

The union points to the definition of "similar" in the online Oxford

like nature or kind," and in Black's Law Dictionary as "nearly
corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a
general likeness, although allowing for some degree of difference." In

Stephen **Reinhardt 5**, U.S. Judge for the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Jason Ray Reynolds; Matthew Rausch,
Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.;
Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Defendants-Appellees, Lexis

Specifically, we must decide whether charging a higher price for initial
insurance than the insured would otherwise have been charged because of
information in a consumer credit report constitutes an \"increase in any
charge\" within the meaning of FCRA. First, we examine the definitions
of \"increase\" and \"charge.\" Hartford Fire contends that, limited to
their ordinary definitions, these words apply only when a consumer has
previously been charged for insurance and that charge has thereafter
been increased by the insurer. The phrase, \"has previously been
charged,\" as used by Hartford, refers not only to a rate that the
consumer has previously paid for insurance but also to a rate that the
consumer has previously been quoted, even if that rate was increased
\[\*\*23\] before the consumer made any payment. Reynolds disagrees,
asserting that, [under]{.underline} \[\*1091\] [the ordinary definition
of the term, an increase in a charge also occurs whenever an insurer

charged an increased rate because of his credit rating when he was
compelled to pay a rate higher than the premium rate because he failed
to obtain a high insurance score. Thus, he argues, the definitions of
\"increase\" and \"charge\" encompass the insurance companies\'
practice. Reynolds is correct.

**'Increasing' means to make greater and requires pre-existence**

Jeremiah **Buckley 6**, Attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co.
of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf>

First, the court said that the ordinary meaning of the word "increase"
is "to make something greater," which it believed should not "be limited
to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual has
previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet the definition offered
by the Ninth Circuit compels the opposite conclusion. [Because
"increase" means "to **make something greater**," there must necessarily
have been an **existing** premium]{.underline}, to which Edo's actual
premium may be compared, [to determine whether an "increase"
occurred]{.underline}. Congress could have provided that "ad-verse
action" in the insurance context means charging an amount greater than
the optimal premium, but instead chose to define adverse action in terms
of an "increase." That def-initional choice must be respected, not
ignored. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10 (1979)
("\[a\] defin-ition which declares what a term 'means' . . . excludes
any meaning that is not stated"). Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that
because the Insurance Prong includes the words "existing or applied
for," Congress intended that an "increase in any charge" for insurance
must "apply to all insurance transactions -- from an initial policy of
insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This
interpretation reads the words "exist-ing or applied for" in isolation.
Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance Prong apply
only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy of insurance,
such as a "cancellation," "reduction," or "change" in insurance. Each of
these forms of adverse action presupposes an already-existing policy,
and [under **usual canons of statutory construction** the term
"increase"]{.underline} also [should be construed to apply to increases
of an **already-existing** policy]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542
U.S. 88, 101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around

Rule 324.102(x) is unambiguous. A guiding principle of statutory
construction (and thus construction of administrative rules) is that
each word be given meaning. See Gillie v Genesee Co Treasurer, 277 Mich
App 333, 345; 745 NW2d 137 (2007). \"This Court must consider both the
plain meaning of the critical words or phrases, as well as their
placement and purpose . . . .\" Id. Rule 324.102(x) refers to \"the
purpose of increasing the recovery of hydrocarbons.\" [The word
\"increase\" means \"to add]{.underline} \[\*10\] [something to or
enlarge something **already in existence**]{.underline}.\" Gwynn v
McKinley, 30 Cal App 381, 389; 158 P 1059 (1916). [A **newly
constructed** frack well does **not** add to or enlarge the recovery of
hydrocarbons. Rather, it **initiates** the recovery of hydrocarbons when
recovery was **nonexistent**. Further, the use of the word
**\"increasing\"** presupposes that the recovery of hydrocarbons
**already exists**, as **words that end in \"-ing\"** suggest
**continuing action**]{.underline}. See Verizon New Jersey, Inc v
Hopewell Borough, 26 NJ Tax 400, 417 (2012). In other words, for a well
to be categorized as an \"injection well\" under the contested language
of Rule 324.102(x), the well must be used for the purpose of recovering
hydrocarbons before and after the injection of fluid. Here, however, it
is not disputed that the frack wells at issue are not used for the
purpose of recovering hydrocarbons before the injection of fluid. Had
Rule 324.102(x) been intended to encompass all recovery of hydrocarbons,
not only the increased recovery of hydrocarbons, it could have simply
read in relevant part, \"the purpose of the recovery of hydrocarbons\"
or \"the purpose of recovering hydrocarbons.\"

**'Increase' requires pre-existence**

**Brown 3** -- US Federal Judge on the District Court of Oregon, "Elena
Mark and Paul Gustafson, Plaintiffs, v. Valley Insurance Company and
Valley Property and Casualty, Defendants", 7/17/2003, Lexis

FCRA does not define the term \"increase.\" [The plain and ordinary
meaning of the verb \"to increase\" is to make something
greater]{.underline} or larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\]
Collegiate Dictionary 589 (10th ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is
increased in the statute is the \"charge for any insurance.\" The plain
and common meaning of the noun \"charge\" is \"the price demanded for
something.\" Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer
takes adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the
price demanded for insurance.

[An insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did not exist
previously]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

Also related to the waiver issue is appellees\' defense relying on a
provision of the insurance policy that suspends coverage where the risk
is increased by any means within the knowledge or control of the
insured. However, [the term \"increase\" connotes change. To show
change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the
condition of the building at the time the policy was
issued]{.underline}. See 5 J. Appleman & J. Appleman, Insurance Law and
Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). [Because no such evidence was presented,
this court cannot determine]{.underline}, on this record, [whether the
risk has, in fact, been increased.]{.underline} Indeed, the answer to
this question may depend on Mr. Glassley\'s knowledge of the condition
of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman &
J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since
the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the
risk which incurred the loss.

CONCLUSION\
Because the consideration of written communication is the cornerstone of
the judicial process, the technique involved in that consideration has
intrigued the ages. That technique, [judicial
interpretation]{.underline}, \[\*434\]  attempts a highly delicate
balance. On the one hand, it [acknowledges the]{.underline} legendary
[imprecision of language. On the other hand, it seeks to glean from that
language the elusive signals of purpose, meaning and intent. A
\"science\" so inexact]{.underline} incessantly [craves]{.underline} a
semblance of [constants \-- conventions assisting to **impose order**
upon understanding]{.underline}.\
Roman law, and subsequently the English common-law system, sought to
appease this insatiable desire by offering up the canons of
construction. [The canons, **fundamental maxims of**]{.underline}
compositional [**meaning**, have proved]{.underline} both vulnerable and
[venerable]{.underline}. Their existence has provided an irresistible
historic target for a labyrinth of denigrating commentary. Yet [the
courts]{.underline}, the construers themselves, [have
claimed]{.underline} the [canons]{.underline} as their own, affording
them [a **determinative role** in]{.underline} judicial
[decisionmaking]{.underline} which transverses the spectrum of
litigation. Accordingly, the [critics are left with little choice but to
concede the canons\']{.underline} existence and [shaping
influence]{.underline}, while pleading for caution in their invocation.\
From the canonical mass, the most popular and powerful maxims of meaning
are perhaps the three here selected for treatment: Noscitur a sociis,
Ejusdem generis and Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Although
different, the three precepts are also similar \-- they counsel an
analysis of associating what is present with what is to be determined.
[The writer, they presume, meant something by what he expressed; that
expression]{.underline}, or at least a portion of it, they insist,
[offers the **best hope** for resolving]{.underline} the
[ambiguity]{.underline} at hand. As they occasionally broaden,
frequently constrict and sometimes exclude, the maxims operate to propel
the interpreter toward an intent, meaning or purpose that will decide
the controversy.

The Court will not construe this term to have its plain and ordinary
meaning, as Mylan proposes, because the word \"increase,\" \[\*62\]
though it has a plain meaning, must be read in the context of the claims
and specification of the \'997 Patent. [To determine if there has been
an \"increase\"]{.underline} in dynamic capacity, [there **must be**
some **initial** dynamic capacity to which the new dynamic capacity can
be **compared**]{.underline}. This comparator is not within the plain
language of the claim, but it is apparent when the term is read in the
context of the entire patent. As explained, the Court concludes that a
skilled artisan would understand that an \"increase\" in the dynamic
capacity for the protein when using a claimed salt pair would be in
reference to the dynamic capacity of the protein when a single salt is
utilized. However, the Court does not believe that the intrinsic
evidence supports the conclusion that a skilled artisan would
necessarily understand that each salt in the salt pair would be provided
at a lower concentration than a single salt, as Amgen proposes. Thus, an
intermediate construction is warranted. See Exxon Chem. Patents, 64 F.3d
at 1555. For the foregoing reasons, the Court construes \"such that the
dynamic capacity of the column is increased for the protein\" as \"such
that the dynamic capacity of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography
column for the protein that \[\*63\] is achieved by using a combination
of a first salt and a second salt is greater than the dynamic capacity
of the column for the protein that is achieved by using a single salt.\"

**[Before-and-after]{.underline} numbers are necessary to determine
whether an 'increase' has occurred**

Marilyn Jean **Kelly 10**, Judge on the Supreme Court of Michigan,
"Adair v. State", 486 Mich. 468, 7/14/2010, Lexis

MCL 141.422a(4) further provides: \"\'Budget\' means a plan of financial
operation for a given period of time, including an estimate of all
proposed expenditures from the funds of a local unit and the proposed
means of financing the expenditures.\" Thus, [in the case
of]{.underline} a mandated [*increased* activity]{.underline} or
services, [a]{.underline} POUM [plaintiff]{.underline} that has its
claim heard before actual increased expenses have been incurred
[need]{.underline} simply [present evidence explaining how much it is
**currently** spending]{.underline} to perform the service or activity
[and how much extra, i.e., the projected amount of \"increase,\" it
anticipates]{.underline} it will have to spend carrying out the
increased level of service or activity. And in the case of mandated new
activities or services, a plaintiff need only present evidence that it
currently spends no money on the service or \[\*\*\*61\] activity, but
anticipates incurring specific necessary costs that are not de minimis
once the mandate becomes effective. Given that estimates of increased
expenses are ordinarily \[\*510\] quantified in budgets, it is
reasonable to conclude that a witness can summarize and provide a
reasonable estimate of an anticipated increase in necessary costs. 21
Ideally, a POUM claim will be decided before the projected necessary
cost increases become actual increases. But in situations such as the
case at bar, where plaintiff school districts had been complying with
the mandates for several years before trial, actual necessary increased
costs, if they exist, should not be difficult, much less insurmountable,
to establish. [In any event, proof of specific necessary increased
costs, projected or actual, is essential in order to verify the
legitimacy of a]{.underline} POUM [claim]{.underline}. 22

\[FOOTNOTE\]

To be sure, plaintiffs may have established \[\*\*\*62\] that the new
requirements are burdensome and require additional staff time. However,
this is not the equivalent of the considerably more specific, and
rigorous, requirements of our constitution. The majority is mistaken
when it asserts that Const 1963, art 9, § 29 does not suggest that POUM
plaintiffs must prove how much their costs increased. [To reiterate, the
word \"increase\" clearly implies the **necessity** of
**before-and-after numbers**]{.underline}. By providing such numbers, a
POUM plaintiff can satisfy the constitutional requirement that it show
how much its necessary costs have increased.

**[Increase =/= Net Increase]{.underline}**

**"Increase" means [SOLELY]{.underline} to "grow larger"---That excludes
tradeoffs, because it's DISTINCT from "change" or "net increase"**

**Chavez 17**

Opinion by Chavez, Acting P. J., Court of Appeal of California, Second
Appellate District, Division Two, Mallano v. Chiang, 2017 Cal. App.
Unpub. LEXIS 2366

As discussed, during the times relevant to this action, section 68203
provided \[\*13\] for mandatory annual increases in judicial salaries by
\"the amount that is produced by multiplying the then current salary of
each justice or judge by the average percentage salary increase for the
current fiscal year for California state employees.\" (§ 68203, subd.
(a).) Defendants contend the phrase \"average percentage salary increase
for the current fiscal year for California State employees\" as used in
section 68203 must be construed to include not only salary increases but
also effective salary decreases caused by mandatory furloughs imposed
during fiscal years 2008-2009 through 2011-2012.

A. The plain language of section 68203 does not support defendants\'
interpretation

Defendants\' interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of
the statute. \"[The plain meaning of **\'increase\'** is to **grow
larger** in size or amount.]{.underline} \[Citation.\]\" (Guillen v.
Schwarzenegger (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 929, 940, 55 Cal. Rptr. 3d 87;
Mirriam-Webster online dict.,
\<https://www.mirriam-webster.com/dictionary/increase\>.) \"[When a
statute refers to an \'increase\' occurring \'\[i\]n any]{.underline}
fiscal [year\' \[]{.underline}citation[\], it is logical to construe
\'increase\' as meaning an increase **over the previous
year**]{.underline}.\" (Guillen, at p. 940.) The plain meaning of the
words \"salary increase\" as used in section 68203, subdivision (a) is
the amount by which a salary is made larger.

As the trial court noted in its statement of decision, [when the
Legislature has \[\*14\] **intended** to use]{.underline} the phrase
increase or decrease, or [terms that denote deductions or decreases,
such as **net increase**, or **change**, it has **clearly done
so**.]{.underline} (See, e.g., § 31870.01, subd. (a) \[county employees
retirement benefits shall be \"increased or decreased to nearest
one-tenth of 1 percent, by 40 percent of the annual increase or decrease
in the cost-of-living as of January 1st of each year\" (italics
added)\]; Welf. & Inst. Code, § 7289.1, subd. (b) \[\"for computation of
the percentage change in the cost of living . . . \[t\]he product of any
percentage increase or decrease in the average index and the amount set
forth in Section 7289 shall be the adjusted amount\" (italics added)\];
§ 12406 \[\"Appointments to these exempt positions shall not result in
any net increase in the expenditures of the Controller\" (italics
added)\].) Section 68203, [subdivision (a) does not include such
terms.]{.underline}

Subdivision (a) of section 68203 includes an express proviso limiting
judicial salary increases: \"\[I\]n any fiscal year in which the
Legislature places a dollar limitation on salary increases for state
employees the same limitation shall apply to judges in the same manner
applicable to state employees in comparable wage categories.\" There is
no similar provision limiting judicial salary increases during fiscal
years in which state employee salaries are effectively \[\*15\]
decreased, and we decline to read one into the statute. (California
Teachers Assn v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 692,
698, 170 Cal. Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856 \[[if words]{.underline} of the
statute [are **clear**, the court **should not add to or alter them** to
accomplish a purpose that does not appear **on the face** of the
statute\].)]{.underline}

The language of subdivision (b) of section 68203 further reinforces the
interpretation that \"average percentage salary increase\" as used in
subdivision (a) includes only salary increases, and not decreases.
Subdivision (b) states: \"For the purposes of this section, salary
increases for state employees shall be those increases as reported by
\[CalHR\].\" Subdivision (b) refers only to salary increases, and it
identifies CalHR as the source of information for such increases. It
does not mention salary decreases, nor does it identify CalHR or any
other agency as the source of information for salary decreases.
Subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 68203, read together, unambiguously
provide that only state employee salary increases reported by CalHR are
to be considered in calculating judicial salary increases.

B. The legislative history does not support defendants\' interpretation

[Defendants urge us to reject the **plain meaning** of the word
\"increase]{.underline}\" as used in section 68203 based on the
statute\'s legislative history, which they claim evinces an \[\*16\]
intent to tie judicial salary increases to the percentage salary
increase, if any, from the average of all state employees, and not just
those few employees whose salaries were increased. They rely on an
analysis prepared by the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary in
connection with a 1979 amendment to the statute:6Link to the text of the
note

\"SB 53 changes the method of granting judges\' annual salary increases
by tying the increase to the annual average salary increases granted to
California State employees up to a maximum of 5%. Thus, if the average
salary increase received by state employees is 3%, the judges would be
entitled to a 3% increase. If state employees do not receive an increase
in any year, the judges would not be entitled to an increase for that
year. \[¶\] . . . \[¶\] By providing that judges would receive the same
pay hikes as state workers . . . SB 53 presents an equitable alternative
to the annual pay increases judges now receive.\"

(Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 53 (1979-1980 Reg.
Sess.).)

There is **[nothing]{.underline}** in the legislative history that
[indicates that]{.underline} the average percentage salary
[increase]{.underline} for state employees in any given fiscal year [was
intended to include effective]{.underline} salary \[\*17\]
**[decreases]{.underline}** [**as well as** increases]{.underline}. The
analysis cited by defendants simply states that judges are not entitled
to a salary increase in any year in which state employees do not receive
an increase. CalHR calculated a 0.00 percent average percentage salary
increase for state employees in fiscal years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013,
and plaintiffs do not dispute that they were not entitled to any salary
increase in those years.

**[Increase =/= Change]{.underline}**

**'Increase' can't mean change, because that would include its antonym,
'decrease'**

Donna S. **Shroud 18**, Judge on the North Carolina Appeals Court, "City
of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC", 818 S.E.2d 116, 7/3/2018, Lexis

The language in the statute is clear --- the condemnor may amend its
complaint and notice of taking and may increase \[\*\*33\] the deposit,
but it may not amend a deposit to decrease the amount. [We cannot read
the word \"increase\" to mean \"change\" since a change could include a
\"decrease.\" Increase is the **opposite** of decrease. We construe the
statute using its plain meaning]{.underline}. See Wilkie, 370 N.C. at
547, 809 S.E.2d at 858. And HN22 the statute plainly allows the
condemnor only to increase its deposit \"at any time while the
proceeding is pending\[.\]\" See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 136-103(d). In
addition, the next phrase gives the landowner \"the same rights of
withdrawal of this additional amount\" as it had for the initial
deposit. Id. The statute contemplates only an increase in the deposit
and provides for the landowner to withdraw the additional amount. Id.
There is no provision for a decrease in the deposit while the action is
pending. And as discussed above, the action is no longer \"pending\"
after defendant\'s filing of a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a).
Thus, the existence of a deposit does not change the result under Rule
41(a) in this case. Even if we assume that a deposit could be increased
after a landowner takes a voluntary dismissal --- although we cannot
imagine \[\*129\] why that would ever happen --- the statute does not
allow an amendment to decrease the deposit at all, so plaintiff\'s
motion here to decrease \[\*\*34\] the deposit does not change our
analysis of the Rule 41(a) dismissal issue.

Louis **Philips 2**, United States Bankruptcy Judge, IN RE Lawrence d.
Goldberg, Debtor; Dwayne M. Murray, Trustee, Plaintiff versus Mae M.
Stacy Trust and F. Eugene Richardson, Defendants, 5/1, lexis) (emphasis
in the original)

In determining the plain meaning of the phrase \"increases the
obligor\'s insolvency,\" the Court initially notes that this phrase
makes no reference whatsoever \[\*\*50\] to a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" test 26 or even to the \"fair consideration\" test of the
Section 3 of the UFCA. 27 Instead, Article 2036 of the Civil Code merely
uses the word \"increases,\" and the absence of \"reasonably equivalent
value\" language or \"fair consideration\" language rings loudly in the
Court\'s judicial ear. Accordingly, [the Court will focus on the plain
meaning of the term \"increases.\" Taking note from one of the
dictionaries of choice of the United States Supreme Court]{.underline},
28 the Court finds that the definition of [the word
\"increase\"]{.underline} in Webster\'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary
[reads as follows]{.underline}:

\[\*270\] [To become ***progressively*** greater]{.underline} (as in
size, amount, number, or intensity). . . . to make greater: AUGMENT. . .
. INCREASE, ENLARGE, AUGMENT, MULTIPLY mean to make or become greater.
INCREASE used intransitively implies *progressive* growth in size,
amount, intensity; used transitively it may imply simple not necessarily
progressive addition. . . ***[the act or process of
increasing]{.underline}***: as . . . addition or enlargement in size,
extent, quantity.

Webster\'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 611 (1990) (emphasis added).

As Webster\'s Dictionary states, [the word \"increase\" means a
progressive growth]{.underline}, that is, an incremental \[\*\*52\]
growth. Such progressive and incremental growth implies that when
Article 2036 was drafted, the codifiers used the simple and
easily-understood word \"increase\" because they meant to imply a
\"dollar-for-dollar\" increase in the obligor\'s insolvency, rather than
a \"reasonably equivalent value\" increase. Otherwise, the codifiers
would not have chosen to use the word \"increase\" with no obvious
limitation on its meaning. Moreover, since Article 2036 was crafted in
1984, well after the UFCA, which was enacted in 1918, the drafters of
Article 2036 must have been well aware of the \"fair consideration\"
requirement in Section 3 of the UFCA, and chose not to adopt such a
limitation. Therefore, the Court may reasonably conclude that HN19Go to
this Headnote in the case.the plain meaning of \"increases the
obligor\'s insolvency\" means a \"dollar-for-dollar,\" incremental
growth, rather than insolvency as measured by a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" standard.

As of this stopping place, the Court has performed its task under the
Louisiana Civil Code: to ferret out the plain meaning of Article 2036 of
the Louisiana Civil Code from the words of the article, itself, if
possible. However, the Court will resort to other modes of statutory
construction \[\*\*53\] in support of its \"plain meaning\" analysis,
primarily to assure ourselves that the apparently groundless arguments
of the defendants really are so.. Positing for argument purposes only
(of course) that the phrase \"increases the obligor\'s insolvency\" is
susceptible of more than one meaning (i.e., a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" meaning), analysis of the purpose of the Louisiana revocatory
action and of its legislative history is now offered.

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id

This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that the agreement
(contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement (contract) between
Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other words, to accept AT&T's
argument the Commission must conclude that two separate contracts, i.e.
the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in Kentucky ("Sprint
Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between Cricket and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and the same.

Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that "*the ICA*
was already extended"; id. at 14, and "*the ICA* Cricket seeks to extend
was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and, finally, "Cricket
cannot extend *the same ICA* a second time . . . ." Id. (emphasis added
in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the AT&T brief (and
elsewhere) [AT&T uses vague and imprecise language]{.underline} when
referring to either the Sprint Kentucky Agreement, or the Cricket
Kentucky Agreement, i[n hopes that the Commission will treat the two
contracts as one and the same]{.underline}.

But it would be a mistake to do so. The contract governing AT&T's duties
and obligations with Sprint is a legally distinct and separate contract
from that which governs AT&T's duties with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky
Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2001 in Case
Number 2000-00480. The Cricket Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2008 in Case Number 2008-033 1.

[AT&T ignores the fact that these are two separate and distinct
contracts because it knows that the merger commitments apply to *each*
agreement]{.underline} that an individual telecommunications carrier has
with AT&T. Notably, Merger Commitment 7.4 states that "AT&T/BellSouth
ILECs shall permit *a requesting telecommunications carrier* to extend
*its* current interconnection agreement . . . . As written, [the
commitment allows any carrier to extend "*its*" agreement]{.underline}.
Clearly, [the use of the pronoun "its" in this context is possessive,
such that the term "its" means - *that* particular carrier's
agreement]{.underline} with AT&T ([and **not any other carrier's
agreement**]{.underline}). Thus, the merger commitment applies to each
agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It necessarily
follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement under Merger
Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another carrier's
right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such agreement has
been extended).

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also
identified certain blood relatives of her deceased husband. [Had it been
her intention to vest the residuary estate in her blood relatives
**solely**, she would certainly have used the **possessive pronoun**
\"my\" instead of the indefinite article \"the\"]{.underline} in the

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a
14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to \"said lines\"
(plural). The use of the plural \"lines\" makes no sense because the
only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The writing
is]{.underline} additionally [ambiguous because]{.underline} other key
words which are \"also may change the size of its pipes\" are dangling
in that [the possessive pronoun \"its\"]{.underline} before the word
\"pipes\" [does not have any **subject preceding**, to which the
possessive pronoun refers]{.underline}. The dangling phrase is the
beginning of a sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a
capital letter as is customary in normal English \[\*\*\*10\]  usage.
Immediately preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a
capital letter, there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which
makes no sense at the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to
the preceding sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing
period. [The above deviations from accepted grammatical usage **make
difficult, if not impossible, a clear understanding** of the words used

concerning the meaning of a disputed phrase in the instrument which

What, then, is exploration? [Exploration is a human activity, undertaken
by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons; it has
components of national interest, scientific research, and technical
innovation but is defined exclusively by none of them.]{.underline}26 We
**[define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human
experience---that is, bringing people into new places, situations, and
environments, and expanding and redefining what it means to be
human]{.underline}**. Exploration in the context of space activity
addresses a number of key questions, such as: what is the role of the
Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the Earth?
Could it survive without the planet?

Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story
that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a
moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the
nature and meaning of human life. **[Exploration by this definition can
be accomplished only by direct human presence and may be deemed worthy
of the risk of human life]{.underline}**. "Ships \[of discovery\] must
voyage into a moral universe that explains who a people are and how they
should behave, that criticizes and justifies both the sustaining society
and those it encounters."27

eliminates the possibility of the other, so this isn't an and/or
situation.

#### And/or means one or the other or both

**Pullum 8** (Geoffrey K., Professor of General Linguistics --
University of Edinburgh, "And/or: \"and AND or\", or \"and OR or\"?",
Language Log, 4-14, http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=35)

[Does and/or mean \"and and or\", or \"and or or\"?]{.underline} That
is, if I say I am interested in A and/or B, do I mean I\'m interested in
A and B and I\'m interested in A or B, or do I mean that I\'m interested
in A and B or I\'m interested in A or B? (You may want to say that it
means I\'m interested in A and B and/or I\'m interested in A or B; but
in that case I repeat my question.) Having reflected on it for a little
while, I am convinced that [the answer has to be that A and/or B must
mean \"A and B or A or B\".]{.underline} That is, if an entity A is
claimed to have the property of being F and/or G, the claim amounts to
saying that either (i) A has the property of being both F and G or (ii)
A has the property of being either F or G. And to claim that F is a
property of entities A and/or B is to claim that either (i) F holds for
A and B or (ii) F holds for A or B. However, in that case [and/or is
effectively identical in meaning with or,]{.underline} so it is at first
rather hard to see why and/or exists at all. But I do have a guess. The
right theory of what or means in English is that it is in general
inclusive but that sometimes the exclusive special case is conveyed as a
conversational implicature. I\'m going to study linguistics at either
York or Edinburgh would often be taken to have the exclusive sense:
since you typically go to a single university to take a single degree,
and during the degree course you have no time to study elsewhere, a
decision to choose York would normally exclude choosing Edinburgh as
well. The exclusive sense is thus conveyed: one or the other of York and
Edinburgh will be chosen, and if it is York it will not be Edinburgh,
and if it is Edinburgh it will not be York. But of course if you think
about it, someone who says she is choosing between those two
universities does not commit herself for life to never studying at the
other. When the two alternatives exclude each other, then the exclusive
meaning is the only one that makes sense. If you are asked whether you
want to sit in the stalls or in the balcony, it\'s one or the other but
not both, because you can only be in one place at one time. [When they
don\'t exclude each other, it\'s always understood that or allows for
both: obviously someone whose ambition is to win either an Oscar or an
Olympic medal wouldn\'t feel a failure if they won both.]{.underline}
Winning both would satisfy the ambition in spades. So my guess would be
that and/or is a way of underlining the point that the or is to be
understood in its inclusive sense rather than its exclusive sense.
Sometimes you want to explicitly indicate \"or more than one of the
above\", and and/or does that. Take the first example of and/or in the
Wall Street Journal corpus of 1987-1989 (a 44-million-word collection of
random articles that linguists often use as a source for real-life
examples because the Linguistic Data Consortium --- the host for the
giant Language Log servers --- made it available in 1993 nice and
cheap). The example (which actually happens to be a quotation from the
Washington Post) is this: Too many of his attitudes, claims and
complaints are careless, conflicting, dubious, inaccurate, mean, petty,
simplistic, superficial, uninformed and/or pointlessly biased. I take it
as obvious that if one hundred percent of the hapless man\'s attitudes,
claims and complaints had all ten properties --- every single one was
careless and conflicting and dubious and inaccurate and mean and petty
and simplistic and superficial and uninformed and pointlessly biased ---
then the quoted claim would be regarded as true, not false. [An or would
have done the job here, but the and/or injects a (logically redundant)
reminder that it may well be the case that more than one of the
list]{.underline} of ten properties [applies]{.underline} to the
miserable individual in question.

## Arctic

### Northernmost Region

#### The Arctic is the northernmost region of the Earth

[Arctic, northernmost region of Earth, centred on the North Pole and
characterized by distinctively polar conditions of climate, plant and
animal life, and other physical features.]{.underline} The term is
derived from the Greek arktos ("bear"), referring to the northern
constellation of the Bear[. It has sometimes been used to designate the
area within the Arctic Circle---a mathematical line that is drawn at
latitude 66°30′ N, marking the southern limit of the zone in which there
is at least one annual period of 24 hours during which the sun does not
set and one during which it does not rise.]{.underline} This line,
however, is without value as a geographic boundary, since it is not
keyed to the nature of the terrain.

[While no dividing line is completely definitive, a generally useful
guide is the irregular line marking the northernmost limit of the stands
of trees.]{.underline} The regions north of the tree line [include
Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), Svalbard, and other polar islands; the
northern parts of the mainlands of Siberia, Alaska, and Canada; the
coasts of Labrador; the north of Iceland; and a strip of the Arctic
coast of Europe.]{.underline} The last-named area, however, is
classified as subarctic because of other factors.

### No Single Definition -- Border Varies

#### There isn't one coherent definition of the Arctic -- political, cultural, and climate considerations all impact the definition

**Arctic Center @ The University of Lapland, no date**

The University of Lapland's Arctic Center, "Arctic Region",
<https://www.arcticcentre.org/EN/arcticregion>

[The Arctic region, or the Arctic, **is a geographic region spreading
around the North Pole. There is no single correct definition of the
region as the southern boundary varies.**]{.underline}

Key ways to define the Arctic:

The Arctic Circle (66 ° 33\'N) delimits the Arctic in terms of solar
radiation. In theory, areas north of the Arctic Circle have at least one
day without daylight in the winter and at least one nightless night in
the summer. In practice, this does not happen everywhere because the
surface of the earth is uneven, and the light refracts in the
atmosphere.

Based on temperature, the monthly average temperature in the Arctic is
below + 10 ° C throughout the year, even in summer.

The forest line follows a temperature-defined area. The forest line is
not a narrow line but a zone tens of kilometres wide between the
northern coniferous forest and the tundra. In this demarcation, the
Arctic is predominantly wooded tundra and glaciers.

Permafrost increases the area of Russian Arctic compared to the other
delimitations. Permafrost is soil that stays frozen for at least two
consecutive years.

[The ice cover determines the Arctic nature of marine areas. Sea ice is
highest in February-March and lowest in September. The surface of the
Arctic ice is monitored almost in real time by satellites. (see The
National Snow and Ice Data Centre)]{.underline}

[Culturally defined, the Arctic covers the homelands of northern
indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

[Political delimitations vary according to how they serve, for example,
the interests of states or international cooperation.]{.underline}

[As the climate warms, **the Arctic shrinks if defined by temperature,
forest line, permafrost, or ice cover.** **Cultural and political
boundaries also vary.** The Arctic Circle is the most permanent of the
delimitations, although also the polar circle moves very slowly due to
the variation of the Earth\'s axial tilt.]{.underline}
