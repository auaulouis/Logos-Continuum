# Russia Relations DA

## File Notes

### File Summary

This file argues that the U.S. and Russia are currently starting to work
together in the Arctic region through joint ventures surrounding actions
like trade and resource development. However, the plan would anger
Russia, disrupting that cooperation. The plan might anger Russia for two
reasons:

1\. It is a unilateral policy. Many Arctic policy is done bilaterally or
multilaterally (see glossary below), but the plan is done without
consulting or informing Russia or other Arctic states, which could make
them nervous or unhappy.

2\. It is a policy that Russia does not like. The reasons for this are
dependent on the plan that you are negating, but generic reasons include
that Russia thinks it might be a prelude to an increased U.S. military
presence in the region or that it could threaten Arctic resources that
Russia cares about.

The DA says that this rupture in cooperation is bad because it prevents
broader U.S.-Russia rapprochement in the Arctic that could be used to
establish diplomacy and cooperation on non-Arctic issues like arms
control, proliferation, the Ukraine War, climate change, and the Middle
East.

In response, the affirmative has several themes of arguments that they
can make:

1\. **The uniqueness is wrong**, and the U.S. and Russia are not
successfully cooperating now: this can be due to the fact that the
negative is wrong about how well the U.S. and Russia is doing OR that
there are thumpers like Trump's Greenland threat that are bad for the
same reason that the DA says the plan is bad and should have caused the
impact.

2\. **There's no link**: this can be due to the fact that Russia doesn't
actually care about the plan, the plan is not a problem, or cooperation
will prevail even if the plan is a problem.

3\. **The internal link is wrong**: this argument would say that either
the plan would not spill over to broader Arctic relations if they are
right about the link or that cooperation in the Arctic would not affect
broader U.S.-Russia cooperation outside of the Arctic.

4\. **There's no impact**: this can be due to arms racing/proliferation
not escalating, the U.S. and Russia not being able to solve anything
together, or the status quo being relatively stable in general, etc.

### Background

Arctic policy has changed substantially over the last few years.

In particular, Arctic policy under the Biden and second Trump
administrations reflects dramatically different approaches to regional
strategy, particularly regarding U.S.-Russia relations and territorial
ambitions. During the Biden presidency (2021-2025), Arctic policy
focused primarily on containing Russian influence through multilateral
cooperation and sanctions following Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in
2022. The Biden administration emphasized working within existing
international frameworks, strengthening NATO partnerships, and
supporting traditional allies like Denmark and Canada in Arctic security
matters. Biden\'s approach maintained established diplomatic norms while
responding to Russia\'s construction of military installations and power
plants in the region.

In stark contrast, Trump\'s second presidency beginning in January 2025
has introduced an unprecedented expansionist agenda that has
fundamentally altered Arctic geopolitics. President Trump has renewed
U.S. interest in Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian influence in
the Arctic Greenland security, but his methods have strained traditional
alliances. Trump has refused to rule out military or economic coercion
to acquire Greenland from Denmark. Simultaneously, Trump has
persistently promoted the idea of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state,
regularly referring to it as such and claiming economic benefits would
justify the arrangement.

### Glossary

**Arctic**: "[The
Arctic](https://nordics.info/nnl/show/artikel/arctic-policies-of-the-nordic-countries)"
[can be defined
differently](https://nordics.info/nnl/show/artikel/arctic-policies-of-the-nordic-countries),
but the definition provided by the 2004 Arctic Human Development Report
is most commonly used because it takes into consideration cultural,
historical, and political boundaries: "all of Alaska, Canada North of
60°N together with northern Quebec and Labrador, all of Greenland, the
Faroe Islands, and Iceland, and the northernmost counties of Norway,
Sweden and Finland\... \[and in Russia,\] the Murmansk Oblast, the
Nenets, YamaloNenets, Taimyr, and Chukotka autonomus okrugs, Vorkuta
City in the Komi Republic, Norilsk and Igarka in Krasnoyarsky Kray, and
those parts of the Sakha Republic whose boundaries lie closest to the
Arctic Circle"

**Arctic Council**: Established in 1996 through the Ottawa Declaration,
the Arctic Council is a high-level intergovernmental forum promoting
cooperation, coordination, and interaction among Arctic states,
Indigenous communities, and other inhabitants on issues such as
sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic. It
includes eight member states and six Permanent Participants representing
Indigenous peoples.

**Bilateralism**: A diplomatic approach involving direct negotiations,
agreements, or relationships between two sovereign states or parties. In
Arctic contexts, this often refers to bilateral cooperation agreements
between Arctic nations on issues such as maritime boundaries, resource
extraction rights, search and rescue operations, or environmental
protection measures.

**Confidence Building Measures**: Diplomatic and military arrangements
designed to reduce tensions and prevent conflicts between states by
increasing transparency, predictability, and communication. In the
Arctic, these may include advance notification of military exercises,
information sharing about naval activities, joint search and rescue
operations, and regular diplomatic consultations between Arctic nations.

**Diplomacy**: The practice of conducting negotiations and maintaining
relationships between sovereign states and other international actors
through official representatives. Arctic diplomacy involves managing
competing territorial claims, coordinating environmental policies,
negotiating resource extraction agreements, and maintaining peaceful
relations despite underlying geopolitical tensions in the region.

**Multilateralism**: An approach to international relations that
involves coordination and cooperation among three or more states through
international institutions, forums, or agreements. The Arctic Council
exemplifies multilateral Arctic governance, bringing together all eight
Arctic states to address regional challenges collectively rather than
through bilateral arrangements alone.

**New START**: The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a
bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and
Russia that entered into force in 2011, limiting each country\'s
deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. The treaty\'s
original duration was 10 years (until February 5, 2021), with the option
for the Parties to agree to extend it for up to an additional five
years. The United States and Russian Federation agreed on a five-year
extension of New START to keep it in force through February 4, 2026. The
treaty is currently set to expire, as Russia is not engaging in
negotiations over it. While not Arctic-specific, the treaty affects
Arctic security dynamics given both nations\' significant Arctic
military presence and strategic nuclear capabilities in the region.

**Non-State Actor**: International entities that participate in global
affairs but are not sovereign governments, including multinational
corporations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Indigenous groups,
international organizations, and transnational advocacy networks. In
Arctic governance, Indigenous organizations serve as Permanent
Participants in the Arctic Council, while environmental NGOs and
extractive industries significantly influence Arctic policy debates.

**Northern Sea Route (NSR)**: A shipping route along the Russian Arctic
coast connecting Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean, running from
the Kara Sea near Novaya Zemlya to the Bering Strait. Administered by
Russia through the Northern Sea Route Administration (NSRA), this route
offers significant time and fuel savings compared to traditional
shipping lanes through the Suez Canal, reducing voyage time between
Europe and Asia by approximately 30-40%. Climate change has made the
route increasingly navigable, with Russia investing heavily in
icebreaker fleets, port infrastructure, and navigational services to
develop it as a major international shipping corridor. However, the
route remains subject to Russian regulatory control, licensing
requirements, and mandatory pilotage services, creating both economic
opportunities and geopolitical tensions as other nations seek guaranteed
access to this strategic Arctic waterway.

**Polar Code (2017)**: The International Code for Ships Operating in
Polar Waters, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
and entered into force in 2017. This mandatory code establishes safety
and environmental protection standards for ships operating in Arctic and
Antarctic waters, covering vessel design, equipment requirements, crew
training, and operational procedures to address the unique challenges of
polar navigation.

**Rapprochement**: The establishment or restoration of harmonious
relations between countries or parties that were previously in conflict
or tension. Arctic rapprochement often refers to periods of improved
cooperation between Arctic states, such as the post-Cold War
normalization of relations that enabled the creation of the Arctic
Council in 1996.

**Realism**: A theoretical approach to international relations that
emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system, the primacy
of state power and national interests, and the inevitability of
competition and conflict between states. Arctic realism focuses on how
states pursue their national interests in the region through military
presence, territorial claims, resource competition, and strategic
positioning.

**The Russian Federation**: The world\'s largest country by land area
and the Arctic state with the longest Arctic coastline, encompassing
approximately half of the Arctic region. It is currently led by Vladimir
Putin. Russia\'s Arctic territories contain significant natural
resources including oil, natural gas, and minerals, and the country
maintains substantial military infrastructure in the Arctic while
pursuing ambitious economic development plans for the Northern Sea
Route.

**Ukraine War (2022)**: The full-scale military conflict that began on
February 24, 2022, when Russia launched a comprehensive invasion of
Ukraine, escalating the ongoing conflict that started with Russia\'s
annexation of Crimea (in Ukraine) in 2014. This war has profoundly
impacted Arctic geopolitics by effectively ending the era of "Arctic
exceptionalism" - the notion that the Arctic remained insulated from
broader geopolitical tensions. The conflict led to the suspension of
Russia from Arctic Council activities by the seven other member states,
froze most Western cooperation with Russia on Arctic scientific research
and environmental projects, prompted increased NATO military presence in
the Arctic, and accelerated discussions about Arctic security among
Western allies. The war has also highlighted the strategic importance of
Arctic resources and shipping routes, as Western sanctions on Russian
energy exports have increased focus on alternative Arctic energy sources
and supply chains.

**Unilateralism**: An approach to international relations where a state
acts independently without seeking cooperation or agreement from other
states. Arctic unilateralism might involve unilateral territorial
claims, military deployments, resource extraction decisions, or
environmental policies that affect the broader Arctic region without
consultation with other Arctic stakeholders.

**Vladimir Putin**: President of the Russian Federation (2000-2008,
2012-present) who has overseen Russia\'s renewed focus on Arctic
development and militarization. Under Putin\'s leadership, Russia has
significantly expanded its Arctic military presence, pursued aggressive
resource extraction policies, developed the Northern Sea Route, and
reasserted territorial claims in the region, making him a central figure
in contemporary Arctic geopolitics.

Meanwhile**[, the Arctic region boasts rich natural
resources]{.underline}**. **[It holds]{.underline}** about **[13% of the
world\'s oil]{.underline}**, **[30% of the natural gas]{.underline}**,
**[25% of the coal]{.underline}**, **[and a significant amount of rare
minerals]{.underline}**. In December 2023, the US unilaterally announced
its claims to extend its continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean and other
regions. It is widely believed that the move is primarily driven by a
desire to access the rich mineral resources in the region, particularly
lithium for battery manufacturing and tellurium for solar panel
production. According to RIA Novosti, the Arctic Ocean seabed is
estimated to contain resources equivalent to 83 billion tons of standard
fuel. **[The possibility of discovering new large-scale oil and gas
reserves in unexplored continental shelf areas is]{.underline}** also
**[very high]{.underline}**. **[However, the unilateral pursuit of its
interests]{.underline}** **[by the US undermines the peace and stability
of the Arctic region]{.underline}**. **[Its behavior is detrimental to
the efforts of the international community]{.underline}** **[to jointly
explore and utilize Arctic resources]{.underline}** **[and contradicts
the trend of peace and cooperation]{.underline}**.

**[Peace and stability in the Arctic]{.underline}** **[provide a

**Devyatkin 25** -- Senior Associate at the Arctic Institute, Lecturer

**[US-Russia talks]{.underline}** in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin
phone call **[signal a possible negotiation for peace in Ukraine
and]{.underline}** **[new opportunities for the countries'
relations]{.underline}**, including in the Arctic region.

**[The Arctic]{.underline}**, warming four times faster than the rest of
the world, may **[be the key region for the US and Russia to advance
cooperation]{.underline}**. **[US-Russia rapprochement may broadly
benefit the world]{.underline}** **[by bringing an end to the disastrous
war in Ukraine]{.underline}** **[and reducing the risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}**, but **[existential environmental
issues]{.underline}** still **[demand attention]{.underline}**.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the **[two countries]{.underline}** to
**[include climate change]{.underline}** **[in the Arctic cooperation
agenda]{.underline}**. The Arctic climate crisis is the "canary in the
coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
**[Dmitriev]{.underline}**, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,
**[named the region as a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation:
"We need to pursue joint projects,]{.underline}** including, for
example, **[in the Arctic]{.underline}**." **[The Arctic region makes
sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides have explicitly
expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy, investment, and
geopolitical issues]{.underline}**. Western sanctions on Russia have led
Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint
energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. **[US officials now
see Arctic cooperation]{.underline}** **[as a]{.underline}** potential
**[means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline}**

In my meetings in Moscow with **[American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline}** and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many **[are interested in diverse forms of Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}**, from cultural diplomacy that celebrates the
commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait,
to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate hazards faced
by both nations. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

**[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the
staff of the countries' diplomatic missions will]{.underline}**
**[significantly reduce]{.underline}** **[the current obstacles to
US-Russia]{.underline}** scientific **[cooperation in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** By making it easier to issue visas and travel
between the two countries, **[Americans and Russians will again be able
to conduct joint research, expeditions, and scientific
conferences]{.underline}** and build models to better understand the
unfolding climate emergency. Scientific cooperation to understand the
changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and local communities
has been blunted by the political fallout of the war in Ukraine.

**[Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional
stability]{.underline}**. More importantly, **[Arctic cooperation will
build trust between the US and Russia that could complement or spill
over]{.underline}** **[into other crucial fields of cooperation such as
arms control, Middle East peace, and global health]{.underline}**.

Nuclear Threats and Misbehavior," The Strategist, Spring 2023,

**[With the]{.underline}** ongoing **[war in Ukraine]{.underline}**
**[and the]{.underline}** recent **[suspension of the New START
treaty]{.underline}**, **[concerns about nuclear
escalation]{.underline}** **[have been on the rise]{.underline}**. Rose
Gottemoeller argues that, **[because of the existential
threat]{.underline}** that nuclear weapons pose, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has a special
responsibility]{.underline}** --- **[indeed, an obligation to
humanity]{.underline}** **[--- to use diplomacy to lower the nuclear
temperature]{.underline}**. In this article, she discusses the nuclear
threat, the importance of diplomacy, and two primary toolsets of
diplomacy and negotiation: nurturing communication and attending to
process.

These words, spoken long ago by President John F. Kennedy, have a
special resonance now, as Russian President Vladimir **[Putin seems bent
on upending the nuclear order that has been in place for over 50
years]{.underline}**. From the start of Putin's adventure in Ukraine,
**[he has threatened "ominous consequences"]{.underline}** for those who
would meddle with Russia's invasion.1 His loyal deputies amplified these
threats, **[calling for nuclear death to rain down on NATO
capitals]{.underline}**.2 Thus, the United States and its NATO allies
were put on notice from the outset that if their support for Kyiv
brought allied soldiers into contact with the Russian invaders,
**[nuclear escalation could ensue]{.underline}**. **[Not since the
darkest days of the Cold War had such explicit nuclear use been
promised.]{.underline}**

Nonetheless, the primary restraint on strategic nuclear weapons, the New
START treaty, remained intact in the first year of the Ukraine war.
Although on-site inspections had been paused by mutual agreement in
March 2020,3 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United
States and Russia continued to exchange notifications about the status
of their nuclear delivery vehicles and launchers on a frequent basis,
sometimes multiple times a day. This continued routine provided
significant mutual confidence that initiating a nuclear exchange between
the United States and Russia was not an aspect of the Kremlin's nuclear
saber-rattling.

This mutual reassurance took a significant blow when, on Feb. 21, 2023,
**[Putin suspended implementation of the New START
treaty]{.underline}**. He and his government stated that no "business as
usual" could be conducted while the United States and its NATO allies
continued to support Ukraine in its fight for continued independence and
sovereignty.4

**[This position is at odds with the longstanding
tradition]{.underline}**, embraced by both the Soviet Union and Russia,
as well as the United States, **[that, where nuclear weapons are
concerned, the concept of "business as usual" does not
exist]{.underline}**. This tradition emerged out of the trauma of the
Cuban Missile Crisis, when the United States and Soviet Union, the two
largest nuclear powers, **[came to the brink of nuclear
conflagration]{.underline}**. The crisis led to a virtual taboo on
brandishing the weapons in the heat of bilateral disagreements. Rarely
were nuclear weapons invoked during Cold War struggles.5

Instead, **[nuclear diplomacy propelled the two countries forward for
over 60 years]{.underline}**. **[Diplomacy enabled the United States and
the Soviet Union to resolve differences without resorting to direct
combat]{.underline}**. Likewise, **[it allowed them to pursue effective
efforts to control and limit nuclear weapons and ensure that they did
not proliferate.]{.underline}**

Throughout this period, **[diplomacy]{.underline}** served a dual
purpose. It **[was a]{.underline}** way to solve tough problems, but
also a **[means to deliver effective messages about goals, objectives,
and national interests]{.underline}**. In this way, **[diplomacy was at
the heart of U.S. resolve to sustain mutual deterrence, both nuclear and
conventional.]{.underline}** Deterrence messaging was a profound aspect
of every negotiation that touched on military forces.

During the current Ukraine crisis, diplomacy between Moscow and
Washington has stagnated, with neither capital willing to engage except
on focused issues.6 Certainly the Biden administration has been clear
that it will not negotiate about Ukraine if Kyiv is not in the room ---
the president has been forceful on that point since February 2022, when
the war began.7

But **[by limiting diplomatic engagement]{.underline}** so narrowly,
**[the administration has been missing opportunities to pursue a goal
that is clearly in the U.S. national interest: bringing down the nuclear
temperature with Moscow]{.underline}**. Moreover, it is losing the
chance to deliver clear deterrence messages directly at the negotiating
table.

This article focuses on how to get **[diplomacy]{.underline}**
**[between the United States and the Russian Federation]{.underline}**
back on track in order to **[address the existential threat of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. It does not, of course, discard the necessity of
maintaining a defense posture that is potent and convincing. As
President Barack Obama said during his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in
2009, "To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to
cynicism --- it is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man,
and the limits of reason."8 **[The egregious Russian invasion of Ukraine
as well as China's growing military forces highlight the necessity of
sustaining a strong deterrence and defense posture, together with
America's allies and partners.]{.underline}**

One might ask, why should Washington make this special effort, when
Moscow has left the table and refuses to return? The Kremlin has raised
high political barriers to any effort to restore full implementation of
the New START treaty and continues to engage in nuclear threats and
sabre rattling. However, **[because nuclear war is an existential threat
to countries around the globe, the United States has a special
responsibility]{.underline}** --- **[indeed, an obligation to
humanity]{.underline}** --- **[to try to keep talking with Moscow.
Washington should do everything it can to lower the nuclear
temperature]{.underline}** **[and return New START to full
implementation]{.underline}**.

Using Diplomacy to Lower the Nuclear Temperature

**[During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were
constantly on the brink of conflict]{.underline}**. Washington and
Moscow were not generally cooperating to solve problems. One particular
**[hotspot was the Middle East]{.underline}**, where battles between
Israel and its Arab neighbors were a regular feature. The United States
and Soviet Union were on opposite sides of this struggle. During the
Six-Day War in 1967 and a few years later, during the 1973 Yom Kippur
War, both sides took steps to raise the readiness of their strategic
nuclear forces. In those days, everyone was familiar with what DEFCON 3
meant.9 In Vietnam during the late 1960s, Soviet air defense forces were
working side by side with North Vietnam to shoot down U.S. fighter
aircraft over Hanoi.10 The late Sen. John McCain knew this story well.
**[Although there were many hot crises between Washington and Moscow
during this period, the two capitals were still able to negotiate to
constrain nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

**[Cold War history shows that it is not only necessary to avoid nuclear
threats, but also to control and limit nuclear weapons. The United
States and Russia possess by far the largest nuclear arsenals,
approximately 4,000 nuclear warheads each. The closest competitor,
China, has approximately 400]{.underline}**.11 Although **[China is fast
modernizing]{.underline}** and needs to be part of the calculus, the
United States and Russia should take the lead in preventing the
**[crisis]{.underline}** in Ukraine from **[escalating to nuclear
use.]{.underline}**

And yet, **[Putin]{.underline}** and his deputies seem to have decided
to set aside this history and its nuclear lessons. They have
**[heedlessly raised the nuclear temperature to levels not seen since
the Cuban Missile Crisis 60 years ago]{.underline}**. **[They have
furthermore refused to do anything to bring it down]{.underline}**. By
refusing to implement the New START treaty, they have shown that they do
not care to do so. For Russia, evidently, even existential threats to
humanity have a tactical political value that can be cashed in on.
Nuclear weapons can be used for leverage to try to get the Kremlin what
it wants in Ukraine. Putin has even gone so far as to dismiss the
importance of the continued survival of Russia. Were
**[Russia]{.underline}** to **[disappear with the rest of the world in a
nuclear conflagration]{.underline}**, as Putin famously stated in 2018,
it would be worth it, for a world without Russia is not worth
preserving.12

Notably, the United States and its allies are not the only ones to have
recoiled from such apocalyptic visions. Chinese leader
**[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping **[and]{.underline}** Indian Prime Minister
Narendra **[Modi]{.underline}** **[were]{.underline}** publicly **[terse
with Putin]{.underline}** during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
summit in Kazakhstan in November 2022, saying that nuclear weapons
should not play a part in the Ukraine war.13 These messages have been
reiterated at high levels, notably at the Munich Security Conference in
February 2023, where Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave a firm "no"
with regard to the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.14 These voices are
highly valuable, because they are more likely to be heard in Moscow than
voices from the United States and its allies.

However, **[America and its allies have a continuing responsibility to
try to bring down the nuclear temperature despite Putin's every effort
to stoke it.]{.underline}** As Lawrence Freedman has argued,
"**[Anything that generates caution and apprehension has possible
deterrent effects, even when the behaviour to be avoided has to be
inferred]{.underline}**."15

The United States is clearly trying to engender caution and apprehension
in the Kremlin through judicious signaling --- bomber demonstration
flights, flight testing of nuclear missiles, and exercises and
training.16 But it has also been careful to avoid taking military steps
that could be construed as escalatory.17 **[Diplomatic communications
are being used to bolster these signals]{.underline}**, as when CIA
Director William Burns, one of the nation's top diplomats, traveled to
Ankara in November to convey messages directly to his counterpart, FSB
Director Sergei Naryshkin.18 Thus, the Biden administration is combining
military action with some **[diplomacy]{.underline}** in an effort to
**[head off]{.underline}** Russian **[nuclear use.]{.underline}**

Washington needs to try to change the status quo with Moscow without
resorting to the use of force.19 Despite the stark difficulty of dealing
with Moscow, **[diplomacy has a special advantage at this
moment.]{.underline}** It is **[a powerful instrument that uses human
communication skills to get across the benefits of certain behaviors and
the costs of others]{.underline}**. Although military backing can
increase its effectiveness, **[diplomacy does not require the movement
of armed forces, increases in operational readiness, or military
exercises in order to be effective. Convincing language and the means to
communicate it can alone produce results.]{.underline}**

**[The value of effective diplomacy is especially clear
now,]{.underline}** at a time when the United States should be highly
wary of using nuclear exercises or demonstrations to respond to Russia's
nuclear threats. As the nuclear peer of Russia, **[America has a special
responsibility: Its diplomats need to try to convince Russia to stop
threatening nuclear use and instead resume responsible nuclear
behavior]{.underline}**. This should be a top U.S. national security
goal.

Such negotiations would be a worthy test of diplomacy's mettle. To have
a chance of succeeding, of course, the United States must have a willing
partner. Thus, **[the first challenge is to bring Russia to the
negotiating table]{.underline}**. Making the case to Putin for direct
negotiations will, at some point, be necessary, a difficult task at a
time when lines of communication between the White House and the Kremlin
have been seriously weakened. Neither side has seen much value in
tending to them in the midst of the current crisis.

Nevertheless, **[functioning lines of communication are a crucial
element of diplomacy]{.underline}**. **[Working directly with a
counterpart]{.underline}**, no matter how unsavory or unscrupulous,
**[is necessary to the success of any negotiation]{.underline}**.
**[Talking]{.underline}** is not a reward for bad behavior. It **[is the
road to altering bad behavior and, in the end, halting
it.]{.underline}**

In diplomacy, **[problem-solving and deterrence messaging go
hand-in-hand]{.underline}**. **[Enabling these two functions to succeed
requires injecting new energy into U.S. diplomatic practice regarding
Russia.]{.underline}** From the outset, of course, top-level political
support from the president and the secretary of state, as well as the
secretary of defense and other key cabinet secretaries, will be
required. They will have to be persistent and committed to engagement.
Such top cover will be absolutely necessary, not only for the diplomats
at lower levels to succeed, but also to gain the support or
"backstopping" that they will require from U.S. government agencies.

Assuming such top-level political support is forthcoming, **[U.S.
diplomats will benefit from thinking through what factors will be most
likely to deliver success in what will amount to an enormous
challeng]{.underline}**e (indeed, possibly an existential one):
**[backing the Russians off their nuclear threats and returning them to
the status of a worthwhile partner in the arena of nuclear control and
limitation.]{.underline}**

But **[as the Trump administration's own Arctic ambitions and rapport

**[and use the icy region as a testing ground for rebuilding ties with

Speaking to reporters on March 13, President Donald **[Trump signaled
the Arctic is on top of America's priority list]{.underline}** and
reiterated his wish to get Greenland, a Danish territory. In remarks
Thursday from Murmansk, in Russia's Arctic, **[Putin spoke favorably of
those plans,]{.underline}** **[calling it a "profound mistake to treat
it as some preposterous talk."]{.underline}**

Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy who has been ferrying messages from
Washington to Moscow, suggested in an interview with former Fox News
host Tucker Carlson that **[the United States and Russia are "thinking
about how to integrate their energy policies in the
Arctic]{.underline}**" **[and "share sea lanes, maybe send LNG gas into
Europe together]{.underline}**," referring to liquefied natural gas.

**[Russia, which saw an opening in Trump's business-first approach,
swooped into renewed talks with U.S. delegations with business
proposals, offering access to the country's mineral reserves and joint
ventures in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

"**[The Arctic is too important for Cold War-style

ensure stability]{.underline}**, **[resource development & environmental
protection]{.underline}**," Putin's business envoy in U.S. negotiations,
Kirill Dmitriev, recently said on X.

with Russia," BNE Intellinews, 02-20-2025,

**[The US and Russia are looking at joint energy projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, **[as part of the ceasefire
negotiation]{.underline}** in Riyadh, Russia's sovereign wealth fund
boss Kirill Dmitriev told Politico on February 19.

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, who
participated in the discussions, revealed that **[the talks were
general]{.underline}** **[but covered]{.underline}** \"specific **[areas
of cooperation]{.underline}**\" and several members of the US team have
admitted that energy was included in the discussion topics.

\"**[It was more a general discussion]{.underline}** -- maybe **[joint
projects in the Arctic]{.underline}**. We specifically discussed the
Arctic,\" Dmitriev said.

**[Trump seeks to expand American influence in the Arctic]{.underline}**
and has considered purchasing Greenland from Denmark, or even taking it
by force, because of its strategic location as well as its large
deposits of underdeveloped natural resources.

Previously, ExxonMobil collaborated with Russia\'s state company Rosneft
on Arctic hydrocarbon exploration but exited the project in 2018 due to
sanctions. Most of Russia's gas was exported to Europe from the Arctic
regions of the Yamal peninsula, the youngest of Russia's vast gas
fields.

**[The US]{.underline}** educated Dmitriev is Russia's
deal-maker-in-chief and **[worked on several]{.underline}** US-funded
**[projects to develop Russia's capital markets]{.underline}** in the
1990s before taking over the sovereign wealth fund in 2011. He has
extensive connections amongst leading US funds as well as good relations
with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.

Notably one of the less high-profile members of the five-man Russian
delegation to the Riyadh talks is Vladimir Proskuryakov who works in the
Russian Embassy in Canada and specializes in Arctic affairs. **[The
delegation is led by veteran diplomats Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov]{.underline}**,
so the presence of a low-profile Arctic specialist on the small team is
surprising.

However, Secretary of State Marco **[Rubio, who led the US delegation in
the talks, hinted that business was high on the agenda and said that
ending the conflict could "unlock a historic US-Russia economic
alliance".]{.underline}**

#### Rapprochement is coming in the Arctic.

**[The General Director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund has spent
more than two decades on cultivating ties with the US
establishment]{.underline}**. Kirill Dmitriev today has close friends in
both the Kremlin and the Washington DC.

**[He is now apparently a key go-between for the Kremlin and the White
House.]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic should be part of a rapprochement between the two
countries]{.underline}**, Dmitriev argues.

\"**[The Arctic is too important for Cold War-style
politics]{.underline}**. **[Russia & the US must find common ground to
ensure stability, resource development & environmental
protection]{.underline}**. **[Cooperation is]{.underline}** not a
choice---it's **[a necessity]{.underline}**. The world is watching,\" he
wrote on X on March 8.

**[Since]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump re-took office]{.underline}** in
January this year, Kirill **[Dmitriev has significantly boosted his
activity]{.underline}** on Elon Musk\'s social median platform.

\"Just published my first post in 12 years of joining this platform.
**[More to come as US Russia cooperation]{.underline}** **[is key to
address world challenges]{.underline}**. X platform will help the
dialogue,\" Dmitriev wrote on February 24.

\"**[Russia is open for US Russia economic cooperation]{.underline}**
**[and believes such cooperations is key for more resilient global
economy]{.underline}**,\" he followed up in a response to
**[Trump\'s]{.underline}** report about his \"**[serious discussions
with President Vladimir Putin of Russia\" and the \"major Economic
Development transactions which will take place between the United States
and Russia.\"]{.underline}**

Kirill Dmitriev has later published a number of posts that includes
praise of Trump and Vice President Vance and disapproval of Volodymyr
Zelensky and the Ukrainians, as well as German and EU positions.

Dmitriev has been General Director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund
since 2011. In February 2025, Putin appointed him to the post as
Russia\'s so-called Presidential Special Envoy on Investments and
Economic Cooperation with Foreign Countries.

The 49-year-old businessman was born in Kyiv and was sent to the US as
part of a student exchange program already as a 14-year-old. In 1996, he
graduated from Stanford with a bachelor's degree in economics and four
years later with a master\'s degree from Harvard.

When Donald Trump took office in 2017, Dmitriev was among the first
officials from Russia to establish contact with the new administration.
During the World Economic Forum in Davos that year, Dmitriev met with
Trump advisor Anthony Scaramucci.

According to media reports, Dmitriev tried to establish a
**[communication channel between Putin and Trump.]{.underline}**

The role as mediator is now back on Dmitriev\'s schedule. He was part of
the **[Russian delegation]{.underline}** that on February 18 **[met with
US Foreign Secretary Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Michael
Waltz in Riyadh]{.underline}**, Saudi Arabia.

Dmitriev has himself a close relationship with the Saudis. On his own
website, the businessman proudly describes how he in 2019 was awarded a
prize by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his **[contributions for a
strengthened cooperation between Russia and the Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}**

The leader of the Direct Investment Fund reportedly has a personal
connection to members of the Putin family. His wife Natalia Popova is
believed to be a close friend of Katarina Tikhonova, the alleged
daughter of the Kremlin dictator. Both Tikhonova and Popova hold top
leadership posts in the company Innopraktika.

Among the supporters of the Innopraktika Fund is Gazprombank, an
investigation shows.

Kirill Dmitriev is himself connected to Gazprombank and several more
major Russian companies. He is board member of Gazprombank, Rostelekom,
Russian Railways and Rosseti, and member of the supervisory council of
diamond-mining company Alrosa.

The businessman has expressed strong support for the war of aggression
against Ukraine and has since February 2022 been on the sanctions list
of the USA. He is also sanctioned by the UK and several more countries.

It is not clear what kind of **[Russian-US cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}** Dmitriev has **[in mind]{.underline}**. The two
countries before Russia\'s annexation of the Crimea had a comprehensive
oil and gas cooperation in the region, and ExxonMobil in 2014 drilled a
historical well in the Kara Sea.

The cooperation never paid off and ExxonMobil lost up to \$1 billion.

**[When Trump]{.underline}** in 2017 **[appointed]{.underline}**
ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to the post as US **[Secretary of
State]{.underline}**, many Russians hoped that **[Russian-US cooperation
in the Arctic would get a boost.]{.underline}**

### AT: Greenland/Denmark Threats Thump

#### Russia likes Trump's threats towards Greenland and Denmark.

International Law from Oxford University.

**[Should Trump expand upon his efforts to absorb Greenland, a territory
of NATO]{.underline}** founding-member Denmark**[, it could provoke a
crisis, potentially fracturing the alliance.]{.underline}**

**[For Putin, such a rupture would amount to a long-desired geopolitical
victory, weakening the NATO alliance]{.underline}** without firing a
shot.

Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede and Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen of Denmark have presented a united front, emphasizing that
Greenland, the strategically located, mineral-rich, semi-autonomous
island, is "not for sale."

While seeking to reinforce ties with their longstanding ally, the United
States, the embattled leaders are simultaneously resisting President
Trump's vow to assert control over the self-governing territory.

Around the same time, **[Trump praised Putin's conduct in Ukraine,
claiming Russia made a "pretty big concession" by "not taking the whole
country."]{.underline}**

**[When asked whether Ukraine would need to cede more territory for
peace, Trump responded in-kind to Putin's remarks regarding
Greenland:]{.underline}**

**["It depends what territory".]{.underline}**

On April 2, 2025, the White House hosted Kirill Dmitriev, head of
Russia's sovereign wealth fund, a Stanford-educated, former
Goldman-Sachs investment banker, for a meeting with Trump's envoy, Steve
Witkoff, a wealthy real estate salesman.

The meeting, a follow-up to their **[U.S.-Russia summit in Riyadh,
expressed as efforts to achieve a cease-fire]{.underline}**, yet,
conducted without Ukrainian or European representatives.

Following the meeting, **[Dmitriev expressed what appears to be the
Kremlin's priority: Russian-US joint ventures in energy production in
the Arctic]{.underline}**.

#### That's Russia's official stance.

Speaking to reporters on March 13, President Donald **[Trump signaled

In remarks Thursday from Murmansk, in Russia's Arctic, **[Putin spoke

to treat it as some preposterous talk."

#### It's a bluff. No one thinks that Trump is serious about buying Greenland.

**Pereira 25** -- International Affairs Journalist at ABC News.

Ivan Pereira, "Trump has options to acquire Greenland, but few are
realistic: Expert," ABC News, 03-28-2025,
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-options-acquire-greenland-realistic-expert/story?id=120231501

However, **[international policy]{.underline}**, **[laws]{.underline}**
**[and decades-long economic and political partnerships]{.underline}**
**[make Trump\'s wishes extremely improbable, according to Phillip
Lipscy, professor of political science at the University of
Toronto.]{.underline}**

\"**[This kind of rhetoric hasn\'t been part of U.S. foreign
policymaking since World War II,\"]{.underline}** he told ABC News. \"If
the United States moves forward with this, this would be a game
changer.\"

Lipscy noted that while acquiring Greenland would bolster the U.S.\'s
security in the Arctic Circle, such a move is not needed because of NATO
nations\' strong military and naval presence.

Annexation is not new in U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana
Purchase in 1803, when the U.S acquired a major portion of what is now
the central part of the country was acquired in a deal with France.

The last time that the U.S. was given land that became territories was
when it acquired three Pacific Ocean island groups as part of the
post-World War II agreement with the United Nations in 1947 known as the
**[Trust Territory]{.underline}** of the Pacific Islands.

That deal **[took years of negotiating]{.underline}** and an agreement
from several nations who worked out the geopolitical landscape of
post-war Oceania.

Only one of those island groups, the Marianas Islands, remains a U.S.
territory.

Lipscy said such **[deals between sovereign nations have dwindled over
the decades in exchange for agreements such as limited military
partnerships, trade deals and other treaties, which take far less time
and help keep the sovereignty of nations.]{.underline}**

Trump and the U.S. would have to negotiate with Denmark\'s government
for a sale or an annexation of Greenland if he were to take over the
land without violating international law or using the military to take
the country by force.

**[Greenland\'s politics are already making any such negotiation
difficult]{.underline}**, according to Lipscy.

**[Greenland is a self-sovereign territory]{.underline}** of Denmark
with its own elected government, with Denmark\'s parliament handling
international matters.

There has been a movement within the island to be independent from
Denmark that will be a key factor in any future plans of a U.S.
acquisition, according to Lipscy.

\"Certainly, there may be a diplomatic solution that starts with an
independent Greenland...but **[it\'s difficult to see that
situation,\"]{.underline}** he said.

In elections earlier this month, **[pro-independence
parties]{.underline}** **[won the most seats in
parliament]{.underline}** but **[neither want to be part of the
U.S.]{.underline}** Greenland is now forming a coalition government in
the wake of the election.

**[Greenland\'s government and its residents have loudly protested
Trump]{.underline}** since he began talking about acquiring it in
December. He floated the idea earlier in his first term in 2019 but
didn\'t pursue it.

\"**[Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders]{.underline}**. We are not
Americans, we are not Danes because we are Greenlanders. This is what
the Americans and their leaders need to understand. **[We cannot be
bought and we cannot be ignored]{.underline}**,\" Greenland's Prime
Minister Mute Bourup Egede said in a Facebook post earlier this month.

Egede also called Friday\'s visit by the Vances and other U.S.
officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy
Secretary Chris Wright, part of a \"very aggressive American pressure
against the Greenlandic community\" and called for the international
community to rebuke it.

**[The Danish government]{.underline}** has also **[pushed
back]{.underline}** hard on Trump\'s calls to acquire Greenland and has
encouraged its residents to speak out against it.

\"**[They know well that Greenland isn\'t for sale]{.underline}**. They
know well that Greenland doesn\'t want to be a part of the United
States,\" Danish Prime Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Wednesday.

\"The attention is overwhelming and the pressure is great. But it\'s in
times like these that you show what fabric you\'re made of. You haven\'t
let yourselves be cowed. You have stood up for who you are - and you
have shown what you stand for. It has my deepest respect,\" she added.

Frederiksen said that **[other European nations are also on Denmark\'s
side]{.underline}** in this back-and-forth with Trump, already hampering
the ties between the U.S. and its allies since Trump regained office.

Lipscy said that such **[a purchase would take a long
time]{.underline}** **[and would]{.underline}** likely **[stretch long
beyond Trump\'s term]{.underline}**, especially if the Greenland and
Danish leadership and their people continue to reject Trump\'s calls.

If Trump continued to ignore the wishes of Greenland and Denmark, it
would also strain those relationships and affect economic, national
security and political alliances that have been in place since the end
of World War II, Lipscy said.

\"It would signal the U.S. can no longer be trusted to be a reliable
partner and hold international norms,\" he said. \"No one would want to
do any type of deal, partnership or negotiation.\"

Trump has refused to rule out military action to take over Greenland,
but Lipscy said that a full-on military acquisition would also not sit
well in the domestic and international political field and, most
importantly, among the American people.

A poll released by the Wall Street Journal days before Trump returned to
the White House found that 68% of Americans opposed the idea.

\"The idea of territorial expansion is coming predominantly from the
president himself and there isn\'t any widespread agreement on acquiring
from the public or the Republican Party,\" Lipscy said.

He predicted that while Trump may be \"banging the table\" more to make
his goal a reality, it won't move the needle beyond his base because
**[the general public knows that such a move would be costly and
ultimately not help national security.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. and Russian officials have identified the Arctic

for]{.underline}** economic **[cooperation]{.underline}**, according to
people familiar with the situation, **[part of the broader detente
President Donald Trump is pursuing with Moscow.]{.underline}**

**[Discussions have included]{.underline}** natural **[resources

people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private
and at an early stage. **[Cooperation over energy exploration is also
seen as a goal by the U.S.,]{.underline}** one of the people said.

**[The topic emerged as Trump has]{.underline}** **[aggressively pursued
an end to the war in Ukraine]{.underline}**, including direct talks with
Russia's President Vladimir Putin. **[Both sides have recently signalled
that they're open to business ventures and cooperation]{.underline}**,
alarming European and NATO allies, which have sought to isolate Moscow
since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

**[U.S. and Russian officials plan to meet]{.underline}** in Istanbul on
**[Thursday to discuss restoring embassy staffing levels]{.underline}**,
according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

One of the people said **[U.S. officials see Arctic cooperation as a way
to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}**, but
cautioned that was unlikely to succeed given how much closer Russia and
China have grown in recent years, **[particularly]{.underline}** with
their "no-limits" partnership **[since the war in Ukraine

Indeed, **[while Trump has yet to deliver the swift peace in Ukraine he

expanded into ambitious]{.underline}** (if vague)
**[proposals]{.underline}** --- **[potentially spanning
everything]{.underline}** from trade routes to energy development

https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1731.html

However, **[Russia is unlikely to discontinue cooperation]{.underline}**
**[with other Arctic states solely due to angst over
resources]{.underline}**. **[Russia's oil, natural gas, minerals, fish
stocks, and other resources are not under any major
threat]{.underline}**. In addition, destabilizing the region could limit
Russia's potential for benefiting from them. Other than the upcoming
CLCS decision (which will be discussed next), there are no major
territorial disputes between Russia and its Arctic neighbors in which
there might be substantial resources at stake**[. No non‐Arctic states
appear poised to clash with Russia over resource control]{.underline}**.
Further, the difficulty of resource exploitation in this harsh, remote
region alone is sufficient to severely hinder economic profitability in
many cases,1 let alone if a conflict were to put at risk personnel,
ships, and infrastructure needed to support these activities.

direction]{.underline}**? **[Or will it remain conducive to constructive
cooperation]{.underline}** with other states in the region, **[thus
preserving the Arctic as a distinct policy field?]{.underline}**

We hypothesize **[three]{.underline}** potential and **[distinct modes
of policy-making]{.underline}** **[that may result in different Russian
approaches to the Arctic]{.underline}**: **[a \"realist
mode]{.underline}**\" **[centred on]{.underline}** security and
**[distribution of power]{.underline}**, **[an \"institutionalist
mode\"]{.underline}** **[centred on preserving
cooperation]{.underline}** **[within established institutional regimes,
and a \"diplomatic management mode\"]{.underline}** also centred on
security interests, but **[characterized by cautious adjustment of
courses of action]{.underline}** within different policy and
geographical areas.

This project traces the changing weight of these modes in the Russian
debate on the Arctic, as well as how these modes condition Russian
policies in and on the region. Our analytical point of departure is that
**[Russian Arctic policy must be understood as a product of a dynamic
\"two-level game\" between domestic and international
factors.]{.underline}**

On the one hand, official policies are shaped by domestic actors and
institutions that protect and project various views and interests, and
are therefore subject to negotiation on the domestic arena. On the other
hand**[, a state\'s security policies and relations are not formulated
in isolation from the policies of other states. If the Arctic comes to
be viewed]{.underline}** **[also by Western Arctic powers as primarily
an arena for state-contestation]{.underline}** **[and
security]{.underline}**, **[that will play into and shape Russian
policies]{.underline}**. In line with these assumptions, the project
will complement the study of how Russian Arctic policy is produced with
supplementary case studies of the Arctic policies of two of Russia\'s
Western Arctic partners, Norway and the USA.

#### That's magnified by the fact that Russian reactions cannot be predicted in advance, making erring away from sudden policy shifts a necessary.

**[Russia's cooperative stance]{.underline}** **[in the Arctic cannot be
taken for granted]{.underline}**. **[Anticipating Russia's behavior in
the Arctic raises the question of whether its intentions can be
confidently inferred from past behavior]{.underline}**. **[Russia's
intervention in Ukraine has been widely described as a
surprise]{.underline}**---even seasoned observers did not expect the
Maidan protests in Kyiv to trigger such an aggressive move from Russia.
In the Arctic, the number of mechanisms (e.g.,  agreements, diplomatic
organizations) through which Russia cooperates on Arctic affairs could
make it difficult to abandon this stance in rapid fashion. Yet,
**[Russia has shown]{.underline}** some **[unpredictable
behavior]{.underline}** in that region as well. For instance, it reacted
very mildly to Greenpeace activists boarding the Prirazlomnaya oil rig
in August 2012, but arrested the crew and impounded their ship in a
similar incident the following year.1 This, **[in addition to its mix of
cooperative and assertive rhetoric on the Arctic, makes Russia's
intentions particularly difficult to read.]{.underline}**

Policies, and Prospects," European Leadership Network, 03-25-2014,

**[Russian policymakers and media have]{.underline}** in recent years
**[had a tendency to portray any foreign military activity in the Arctic
as hostile and provocative]{.underline}**, **[even when such activity
takes place well outside the country's]{.underline}** territorial
**[waters or airspace]{.underline}** **[and does not infringe on
recognized Russian rights]{.underline}**. **[The Russians are concerned
that]{.underline}** foreign **[state]{.underline}** or non-state actors
**[may try to take control of natural resources]{.underline}** and**[/or
shipping lanes rightfully belonging to the Russian
Federation]{.underline}**. According to a recent statement by Nikolai
Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, the United States,
Norway, Denmark, and Canada are pursuing "a common and coordinated
policy aimed at denying Russia access to the riches of the Arctic
continental shelf". In a somewhat similar manner, Canada's Prime
Minister, Stephen Harper, has stated on several occasions that **[his
country faces "increasingly aggressive Russian actions", necessitating
adequate defensive measures.]{.underline}**

Obviously, statements such as the ones cited above are often intended
for domestic audiences and should not necessarily be taken at face
value. At the same time, there are many indications that **[the security
concerns are genuine]{.underline}**, **[and that fear is a factor in
Arctic politics]{.underline}** also in 2014. Many Arctic **[states are
concerned that their neighbors]{.underline}** or outside actors **[may
attempt to infringe on their rights and interests, including the access
to natural resources or shipping lanes of considerable value to their
national economies]{.underline}**. **[None of the states that surround
the Arctic Ocean exclude the possibility of interstate disputes in the
region]{.underline}**, and none of them are willing to rely on anyone
except themselves to protect their northern maritime borders,
sovereignty, and sovereign rights.

**[For Russia as]{.underline}** well as for other Arctic rim states,
**[the stakes are undoubtedly high]{.underline}**. It is estimated that
some **[30 per cent of the world's undiscovered reserves of natural gas,
and 13 per cent of the undiscovered reserves of oil, are located north
of the Arctic Circle]{.underline}**. **[Among the areas specified for
future development are Russia's Yamal Peninsula in northwestern
Siberia]{.underline}** and the continental shelf in the Barents and Kara
Seas. In a more distant future, petroleum operations in areas further
north and east may become a reality. Russia will soon claim ownership to
a shelf area of 1.2 million square kilometers (460,000 square miles)
between the outer limits of the country's current 200-nautical-mile
economic zone and the North Pole. Efforts are also taken to facilitate
an increase in ship traffic along the northern coast of the Eurasian
continent. The annual number of passages along this northern waterway is
still fairly modest (71 in 2013), but cargo volumes are growing year by
year.

**[The]{.underline}** Arctic coastal **[states' security
concerns]{.underline}** on the northern frontier **[are
shaped]{.underline}** not only by the region's emerging role as an arena
for economic and industrial activity, but also **[by the region's place
in the nuclear deterrence strategies of Russia]{.underline}** and the
United States. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United
States developed long-range nuclear weapons that could be launched
across the Arctic Ocean, either from locations on land, from the sea, or
from the air. The number of deployed warheads has been reduced
significantly since then, but all elements of the nuclear triads are
still in operation and thus relevant to the security situation in the
region. The weapons have also become more sophisticated, most notably
with the development of land- and sea-based anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
systems, particularly after the collapse of the ABM Treaty regime in the
early 2000s. The latter development is likely to remain a source of
contention between the United States and Russia, which sees sea-based
ABM systems as a potential threat to its nuclear deterrent in the
Arctic.

When developing strategies to cope with future threats that might arise,
**[security analysts have a tendency to "assume the
worst]{.underline}**", that is, scenarios that do not necessarily
reflect the current state of affairs. No**[t knowing the (future)
intentions of their neighbors or outside actors, they are afraid to risk
shortfalls in military capability, and may therefore chose to "play it
safe".]{.underline}** **[Based on their own interpretation of other
actors' intentions and military potential, they may advocate measures to
strengthen domestic military capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Once
implemented, these measures may be perceived by other states as
potentially threatening, and lead to military or other
counter-measures]{.underline}**. In the International Relations
literature, **[this phenomenon is often referred to as "the security
dilemma".]{.underline}**

**[Moscow]{.underline}** often **[frames its foreign and domestic
policies as defensive responses to perceived threats, aiming to protect
its national interests and legitimate its assertiveness]{.underline}**.
**[As such, the Kremlin's actions provide a window into its
insecurities. These are particularly acute in the Arctic]{.underline}**,
**[where concerns over nuclear military vulnerabilities]{.underline}**
**[and the capacity to extract Arctic resources]{.underline}** **[have
massively influenced Russia's policy rationale]{.underline}**.

Military insecurity

Russia's relations with Western countries in the Arctic have been
entangled in a "security dilemma" for over a decade: **[actions taken by
one state to enhance its security often lead to countermeasures by
others, fuelling a cycle of tension and militarisation.]{.underline}**

While the EU has focused more on a peaceful agenda related to climate
and Indigenous issues, the US and some NATO member states have been
developing their military capabilities in the Arctic in response to
similar actions by the Kremlin. For example, since 2022, the US expanded
NATO military exercises and infrastructure upgrades in Alaska, while
Norway has undertaken comparable efforts to bolster its Arctic defence
posture using its own military base. Such **[Western actions have only
increased Russia's perceived military insecurities]{.underline}**.

In particular, Russia's main military insecurityin the Arctic stems from
the Kremlin's nuclear deterrence strategy. A significant share of
Russia's nuclear arsenal is deployed on Arctic-based submarines, which
form the core of its second-strike capability. Russia's ability to
deploy these submarines in the northern seas while remaining undetected
by foreign forces is key to its nuclear deterrence strategy. As a
result, the Kremlin views Western reconnaissance, research and patrols
as potential threats aimed at detecting these assets.

The alarming rate of Arctic ice melt in recent years has further fuelled
Russia's anxious reactions. The reduction in ice cover along with the
development of modern acoustic and radar methods can help reveal
previously hidden Russian submarines, increasing their vulnerability.
Ice melt also brings broader security concerns for the Kremlin. As
navigation becomes easier, Russia's vast northern coastline is losing
its natural defence barrier. Moscow increasingly fears this may weaken
its Northern Fleet's ability to deter a conventional Western attack from
the north, prompting further militarisation of the region.

Economic insecurity

The second **[insecurity shaping Russia's Arctic policy is over the
perceived threat to its ability to safely and effectively extract oil
and gas]{.underline}**. Russian officials frequently cite that around
80% of the country's natural gas and 17% of its oil reserves are located
within the Russian Arctic zone. **[The Kremlin has even dubbed the
Arctic as its "resource base of the 21st century".]{.underline}**
However, over two-thirds of these reserves---particularly those located
offshore---are hard-to-cover and inaccessible due to technological
limitations. At the same time, fields with more accessible
extraction---mostly located in other regions of Russia---are gradually
being depleted.

**[For a country that relies on oil and gas for 20% of its GDP, this is
an existential issue]{.underline}**. In response, Russian state
companies actively sought partnerships with international firms to
develop Arctic projects---fully aware of their dependence on foreign
technology and despite tightening regulations on foreign investment in
the Arctic. One frequently highlighted success story was the cooperation
between Rosneft and ExxonMobil in the Kara Sea, which gave Russia access
to technologies for deepwater drilling. This collaboration was widely
publicised in Russia, along with Putin's personal involvement, as a
major strategic win.

That trajectory changed dramatically in 2014 when the US and the EU
imposed sanctions on Russia after its illegal annexation of Crimea.
These included restrictions on the export of technologies and equipment
critical for Arctic resource development, effectively stopping or
delaying parts of Russian Arctic projects and shutting down joint
ventures like the one with ExxonMobil. The sanctions were a targeted
**[blow to Russia's ability to develop energy reserves, a move which the
Kremlin saw as "clearly aggressive]{.underline}**". In the aftermath,
**[a sense of strategic vulnerability and paranoia intensified among
Russian officials, built on the idea that the West is pursuing a policy
of taking Russia's natural resources.]{.underline}**

Having a meltdown

**[The Kremlin's growing insecurities about Russia's military and
resource capabilities have deepened significantly since the invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}**. The accession of Finland and Sweden to
**[NATO]{.underline}** has left Russia effectively "encircled" by the
alliance's members in the Arctic. This **[intensified its feelings of
vulnerability]{.underline}**, as did the 2022 sabotage of the Nord
Stream pipelines. Although Russia had already halted gas deliveries
through the pipelines, the attack exposed its inability to secure
critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. In 2024, a successful
Ukrainian drone strike on the Olenya airbase---located above the Arctic
Circle and home to Russia's strategic bomber aircraft---dealt another
blow to Kremlin confidence.

In parallel, Western sanctions targeting Russia's Arctic projects have
intensified since 2022, with the 17th EU package adopted in May 2025.
They have largely focused on a deep insecurity for Russia: liquefied
natural gas (LNG). But the Kremlin has little room for manoeuvre against
these measures. It has promoted projects like Arctic LNG 2 as
replacements for lost pipeline gas exports to Europe. But Western
countries have imposed successive sanctions aimed at undermining the
project's viability including blacklisting the operating company,
restricting access to LNG ice-class tankers and targeting tanker
operators. As a result, despite reported efforts by Russia to circumvent
some of these restrictions on Western equipment, the timeline for Arctic
LNG 2 has repeatedly been delayed.

These events have hastened the security dilemma in the Arctic.
**[Russian officials]{.underline}** now **[interpret nearly all NATO
activity in the region]{.underline}** as **[threatening and a "potential
prelude to direct confrontation]{.underline}**" **[while they widely
perceive America's Arctic strategy as overtly "confrontational" and
Western sanctions as a targeted offensive.]{.underline}**

Concerns for the International Community

Although maritime traffic in the region is a fraction of overall global
traffic, it accounts for a significant number of vessel incidents (such
as groundings, mechanical failure, ice damage, fires). In 2016, there
were 55 reported shipping incidents north of the Arctic Circle, with the
majority stemming from machinery damage or failure, followed by vessels
that were wrecked or stranded. **[The rising number of vessels in the
region]{.underline}** --- to include an increase in tourism and
recreational traffic **[--- is worrisome]{.underline}** **[due to the
increased potential for incidents]{.underline}**, **[the lack of robust
response capabilities]{.underline}**, and the limitations of operating
in the harsh environment of the Arctic.

**[To address the growing concerns abou]{.underline}**t the safety of
**[ships]{.underline}** and lack of defined maritime standards in
**[the]{.underline}** Arctic, the United Nations' International Maritime
Organization drafted the **[Polar Code]{.underline}**, which **[took
effect on Jan. 1, 2017 for ships operating in polar
waters]{.underline}**. This code establishes mandatory regulations and
standards for vessels operating in ice-covered waters. The Polar Code
will require regular updates to keep pace with changes in ice conditions
and risk. Further, the International Maritime Organization lacks its own
enforcement mechanism and instead relies on classification societies,
the entities that certify ships for operation, to ensure compliance
prior to issuing a Polar Code certification. **[Safety of maritime
traffic in the region demands improved governance]{.underline}**,
response capabilities, and maritime domain awareness. In addition to
updating the Polar Code to reflect the evolving Arctic maritime
environment, the **[international community must pay more attention to
ensure strict protocols and response capabilities.]{.underline}**

**[Given how severe the consequences of a potential regional disaster
would be]{.underline}**, and the current paucity of response
capabilities, **[the Arctic is a region particularly well suited to
cooperation]{.underline}**. Some **[international organizations are
already cooperating to address regional challenges]{.underline}**. The
Arctic Council has proven to be an effective coordinating mechanism for
the region. Established by the Ottawa Declaration in 1996, the council's
members include the eight Arctic nations as well as six international
organizations representing indigenous peoples. Thirteen non-Arctic
states have been approved as observers, including China, South Korea,
Singapore, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The Chair of
the Arctic Council rotates every two years and the current chair,
Finland, has established a priority of increasing cooperation and
improving connectivity in the Arctic.

Yet despite the noteworthy progress of the International Maritime
Organization and the Arctic Council, the international community faces a
number of limitations. The Arctic Council's mandate specifically
excludes military security. The annual Arctic Security Forces Roundtable
offers a suitable venue for such discussions, but Russia was excluded
from this year's conference due to ongoing tensions stemming from the
Crimea annexation. Moreover, the international community is not prepared
to respond to a near-term Arctic emergency. The absence of
well-developed protocols, significant infrastructure, hydrographic
surveys, communications capabilities, emergency response assets, and
operational proficiency all pose challenges to a coordinated emergency
response.

Implications for International Security

**[Despite]{.underline}** these **[challenges]{.underline}**, **[the
Arctic is not doomed to falling into the trap of the security
dilemma]{.underline}**. **[The Arctic Council has been a useful forum
for cooperation on critical issues]{.underline}** like the protection of
indigenous peoples, environmental concerns, and search and rescue.
**[Thus far, the council has proven to be an effective coordinating
mechanism for nations to address non-security challenges and
opportunities]{.underline}**. The difficult conditions of the region ---
**[and the need for extensive international cooperation]{.underline}**
to protect the unique environment --- **[make it ideally suited for
working cooperatively]{.underline}**.

**[Significant progress has been made on Arctic
governance]{.underline}**, **[but there is still much to be
done]{.underline}**. Overall Arctic activity is experiencing an upward
trend --- this will almost certainly continue as natural resources
become increasingly accessible. The region's bathymetric and
climatological dangers, high costs, and uncertain governance preclude it
from becoming a major **[maritime]{.underline}** trade
**[route]{.underline}** in the near future and **[will require a more
measured approach]{.underline}**. Maritime activity is likely to remain
limited predominantly to destination shipping, fishing, and tourism
rather than becoming a viable alternative to the Suez Canal.

Despite this limited scope of future activity, **[failure of the Arctic
stakeholders to cooperate]{.underline}** now **[could be catastrophic in
a crisis]{.underline}**. **[An Arctic emergency]{.underline}** on the
scale of Costa Concordia or Deepwater Horizon **[would]{.underline}**
almost certainly **[result in high environmental and human costs given
the lack of search and rescue capabilities, poor communications, and
subpar regional infrastructure currently in place.]{.underline}**

**[These issues affect all Arctic nations]{.underline}**, as well as the
organizations and non-Arctic nations with economic and environmental
interests in the region. Indeed, the Arctic presents a unique
geopolitical challenge, combining the traditional strategic interests of
the Arctic nations --- and those, such as China, with stated regional
economic interests --- with a distinct demand for international
cooperation to protect its fragile environment and indigenous
communities. **[Thus far, stakeholders have cooperated to resolve the
most pressing issues]{.underline}** by implementing protocols for
shipping and signing agreements on search and rescue, prevention of oil
pollution, and regulation of fishing. **[This cooperation offers cause
for optimism that the Arctic could remain insulated from geopolitical
tension in more developed parts of the globe]{.underline}**. **[Yet as
the region warms, tensions may rise due to economic
competition]{.underline}** **[or spillover]{.underline}** from other
global disputes. **[It is critical to]{.underline}** strengthen the
mechanisms and support of the Arctic Council and to continue to **[work
cooperatively]{.underline}** to ensure the safety and security of the
Arctic. The region is well-positioned to be peacefully developed, but
the geostrategic conditions are in place for a potential conflict if the
international community fails to act.

Increased Interest in Arctic Resources

**[Increasing Arctic maritime access has raised expectations about
unlocking precious energy reserves that]{.underline}** to date **[have
been too difficult to extract]{.underline}**. In 2008, the USGS raised
global interest in the region by publishing estimates of the
yet-untapped reservoirs of oil and natural gas believed to be buried in
the Arctic.16 Could competition for Arctic resources, which not only
include hydrocarbons but also minerals and fish, drive the region toward
conflict? **[Russia]{.underline}**, in particular, **[has a high stake
in developing Arctic resources]{.underline}**, **[with its lion's share
of territory and high hopes for economic progress driven by the
exploitation of resources in its northern territories.]{.underline}**

We begin by briefly overviewing the Arctic resources that have brought
global attention to the region, starting with hydrocarbons. As global
energy demand increases and conventional fossil fuel supplies dwindle,
the oil and gas industries have begun to seek new reserves in
more-extreme environments, such as deep-ocean drilling and exploration
in the Arctic.17 Until recently, most oil and gas exploration and
production in the Arctic has been limited to onshore or near-shore
operations.18 Increasingly, companies are prospecting in areas far off
shore that were previously determined to be economically infeasible for
exploration. These activities could pay off: The 2008 USGS estimates of
"undiscovered" Arctic hydrocarbon reserves total 1,669 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas, 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids, and 90
billion barrels of oil.19 These numbers represent approximately
30 percent of the world's gas and 13 percent of global oil that have not
yet been successfully prospected, but appear to exist, geologically
speaking, and may be recoverable without relying on major technological
breakthroughs.20

Across the Arctic region, natural gas is about three times more abundant
than oil. Most of the natural gas is in Russia,21 while the largest
amount of "undiscovered" oil may be in the Alaskan Arctic. Most of these
resources are projected to exist offshore, on continental shelves in
less than 500 meters of water.22 Russia has submitted a bid to the CLCS
to extend its continental shelf (discussed in the next section); if
approved, it will provide the country exclusive exploitation rights to
continental shelf reserves that may represent up to 60 percent of
Russia's total hydrocarbon resources.23

Assuming geological estimates are correct, the economic feasibility of
the oil and gas buried deep beneath the Arctic Ocean is dependent on a
number of factors---principally global energy prices, but also advances
in and availability of the infrastructure and technology required to
bring these hydrocarbons to market. Environmental and other regulations
on operations are also important considerations. Combined, these
challenges and constraints make investing in "undiscovered" hydrocarbon
prospecting and extraction quite risky. Although many companies are
still involved in a number of Arctic drilling projects, Shell's
well-publicized exit in 2015 from the North Slope of Alaska suggests
that not all energy companies are willing to stomach the inherent
uncertainty and extremely high cost that go along with Arctic resource
extraction.24

**[Mining of metals and rare-earth minerals in the Arctic has great
economic potential]{.underline}**.25 Large deposits are known to exist
across the Arctic---in Russia, several new mines are being developed
along the Yamal Peninsula and other Arctic coastal areas. Greenland's
mineral deposits have also gained attention as ice sheets shrink and
changes are made to mining policies and regulations.26 The Red Dog mine
in Arctic Alaska is a world leader in producing zinc,27 and one of the
world's largest diamond mines opened in 2016 in northern Canada.28

**[The Arctic also hosts valuable fisheries]{.underline}**, which, as
climate warms, may become even larger and more diverse if habitats shift
northward as predicted. The Arctic coastal states regulate fishing
within 200 nautical miles (nm) of their coastlines as well as inland
fishing. Management of these fisheries varies; for example, Russia
engages in commercial fishing, whereas the United States has prohibited
it.29 There also may be lucrative fishing now, and especially in a
warmer future, in the central Arctic Ocean, outside of the coastal
states' exclusive economic zones (EEZs).30 Although fishing in this area
is impractical, if not infeasible, due to sea ice**[, the Arctic Coastal
states have recognized its potential dra]{.underline}**w in the future
for China and other countries that suffer from depleted fish stocks
closer to home, and are taking diplomatic and policy steps to ensure
that the high seas of the central Arctic remain closed to commercial
fishing, at least until more research can be conducted to inform
appropriate management for these fisheries.31 The resulting declaration,
signed in 2015, was also a notable diplomatic achievement for Russia and
its Arctic coastal neighbors at a time of otherwise strained
relationships in the wake of ongoing tensions over Ukraine.

Although there is no doubt that the Arctic contains vast economic
potential for Russia and others, there are some important reasons why
this factor, on its own, is unlikely to diminish Russia's cooperation
with its Arctic neighbors. Potential for high global energy prices,
along with the development of the necessary infrastructure and access to
extraction technologies, will be instrumental in determining the
magnitude of impact from this factor. In addition, Russia's natural gas,
oil, minerals, fish stocks, and other resources are not under any major
threat, real or perceived, from inside or outside the Arctic. Other than
the upcoming CLCS decision we will discuss next, there are no major
territorial disputes between Russia and its Arctic neighbors in which
there might be substantial resources at stake. Even if Russia is not
successful in its bid for certain contested areas of the Arctic Ocean
seabed, it has other hydrocarbon resources within its EEZ that can be
developed. For example, only about 20 percent of the Barents Sea and
15 percent of the Kara Sea have been explored; the East Siberian Sea,
Laptev Sea, and the portion of the Chukchi Sea off the Russian coast
have not been explored at all.32 In the Barents and Kara seas,
approximately 430 million tons of oil and 8.5 trillion cubic meters of
natural gas have been discovered on the Russian continental shelf but
are yet to be developed.33

It could be argued that tensions around resources may come from
non-Arctic nations. China, in particular, has shown an interest in
Arctic resources. However, Russia has carefully made China a partner,
not an adversary, in Arctic resource extraction. For example, the
countries are collaborating in efforts to extract natural gas from the
Yamal Peninsula. Further, Russia and China appear poised to collaborate,
rather than compete, when it comes to mining because it could give them
a strategic advantage in controlling rare-earth metals that the United
States and other developed countries desperately need for a large number
of industries.34 The Arctic Coastal states, including Russia, have also
involved China in discussions about prohibiting commercial fishing in
the Arctic high seas, clearly acknowledging its Arctic interests and
attempting to secure its compliance with the regulation in so doing.

Destabilizing the region could also limit Russia's potential to benefit
from its Arctic resources, which its national priorities clearly
indicate it wishes to do. The difficulty of resource exploration and
exploitation in this harsh, remote region hugely complicates the road to
profitability,35 let alone if a conflict were to put at risk personnel,
ships, infrastructure, and sea lanes needed to support these activities
and bring resources to global markets. Further, Russia has long been
dependent on western technology for oil and gas exploitation. If
sanctions remain in place and western companies advance offshore
drilling technology, Russia's access to these innovations may be delayed
or prevented altogether, limiting the nation's ability to economically
exploit some of its offshore energy reserves.36

However, **[Russia's priorities could change]{.underline}**,
**[depending on its strategic circumstances]{.underline}**, **[which
could influence its responses to Arctic events]{.underline}**.
**[Consider, for example, a situation in which Russia perceives a threat
to its Arctic influence and infrastructure from fishing or research
vessels flagged to other Arctic countries operating close to or
(illegally) just within the Russian EEZ]{.underline}**. **[If Russia
were to interdict and hold these in response, tensions could
rise]{.underline}** **[and amplify other disagreements]{.underline}**,
**[leading Russia to consider suspending cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. **[Russia has displayed a willingness to react
with military force to the incursion from another state]{.underline}**
in its EEZ, **[particularly if it is perceived as an immediate threat to
military or energy infrastructure.]{.underline}** For example, in 2013,
Russia arrested the crew of Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise that
attempted to climb its oil rig and charged them first with piracy, then
hooliganism (punishable by 15 and 7 years in prison, respectively),
while seizing the ship.37 Earlier in 2012, Russian Border Guard fired
at, disabled, and boarded a Chinese vessel illegally fishing in Russia's
EEZ.38

### Link\-\--REMs\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Trying to develop REMs in the Arctic would initiate a Cold War between the U.S. and Russia.

**Rowe 22** -- Arctic Journalist at Geographical.

Mark Rowe, "Arctic nations are squaring up to exploit the region's rich
natural resources," Geographical, 08-12-2022,
https://geographical.co.uk/geopolitics/the-world-is-gearing-up-to-mine-the-arctic

Is **[a new Great Game set to be played out]{.underline}**, with major
powers scrambling for their ice axes and crampons in a bid to gain early
footholds? There are certainly parallels between the end of the Cold War
and today's climate change. 'During the Cold War, the Arctic was cold in
all its guises; literally and also politically, it was a place apart,'
says Caroline Kennedy-Pipe, head of politics and international studies
at the University of Loughborough. Since the 1990s, as the Cold War
melted away, so has Arctic melting accelerated. 'What happens in the
Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. Just as melting Arctic glaciers lead
to sea-level rise in the eastern Mediterranean, so are **[the emerging
geopolitics of the Arctic impacting how the world's major powers
interact with one another.']{.underline}**

The Arctic Circle encompasses about six per cent of the Earth's surface,
an area of more than 21 million square kilometres. Around 40 per cent of
this area is land (belonging to various countries) and more than a third
is made up of the same countries' continental shelves, which sit under
less than 500 metres of water. The rest of the region is made up of the
international waters that lie beyond the 200-nautical-mile limit of the
exclusive economic zones of the eight Arctic nation states: Russia, the
USA, Canada, Denmark (through Greenland), Sweden, Finland, Norway and
Iceland. More water gets exposed each year. In late 2020, according to
NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, sea ice cover shrank to
3.74 million square kilometres -- 2.48 million square kilometres below
the 1981--2010 average and the second-lowest extent since modern
record-keeping began during the late 1970s. The startling decrease was
linked to a Siberian heatwave in spring 2020 that began the year's
Arctic sea ice melt season unusually early. Last year, Arctic
temperatures were 8--10°C warmer than average.

The main Arctic regions linked to oil and gas exploitation are the
Beaufort Sea (North Slope, Alaska, and Mackenzie Delta, Canada) and the
northwest Russian Arctic (Barents Sea and West Siberia). Oil and gas are
also found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Nunavut). According to
the US Geological Survey (USGS), up to 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,669
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of liquid
natural gas may remain in the Arctic, around 84 per cent of it in
offshore areas. This translates to roughly 22 per cent of the
undiscovered, technically recoverable fossil fuel resources in the
world. The USGS says that the 'extensive Arctic continental shelves may
constitute the... geographically largest unexplored prospective area for
petroleum remaining on Earth'.

For now, however, oil and gas aren't at the top of the international
wishlist. 'If you want to get oil and gas out of the Arctic, it's going
to cost you a lot -- setting up the infrastructure, transporting it,'
says Nima Khorrami, a research associate at the Washington DC-based
Arctic Institute. 'Why do that when there's still so much available in
the Middle East?'

Instead, **[the main drivers of the Arctic resource rush]{.underline}**
**[are minerals, in particular rare earth metals]{.underline}** such as
neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium. **[These minerals are
key to the world's electric-vehicle and renewable-energy revolutions,
underpinning battery technology]{.underline}** **[and wind
turbines]{.underline}** among other things. However, it's worth noting
that lead, iron, nickel, zinc, gold, silver, coal, mica, precious stones
and construction minerals such as sand, gravel and crushed rock are also
believed to be present in significant quantities.

**[The estimated value of minerals in Arctic Russia stands at \$US1.5--2
trillion]{.underline}**. The Geological Survey of Norway concluded that
the subsurface of the Kola Peninsula contains a 'remarkable' abundance
of various minerals. Meanwhile, the Canadian Shield, which extends
through eastern and central Canada from the Great Lakes to the Arctic
Ocean, features high-grade metamorphic rocks that hold large reserves of
copper, gold, lead, molybdenum and uranium. In Greenland, melting ice is
exposing mineral belts that are highly likely to contain gold, nickel,
platinum-group elements, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds and
rare earth elements.

Most of the known resources are located within the boundaries of Arctic
nation states, making their ownership and rights to any exploitation
politically uncontroversial and beyond challenge. 'The land masses are
pretty much clearly defined among the Arctic Eight and their exclusive
economic zones,' says Boulègue. 'On land and within their continental
shelves, there is no scramble for resources.'

Yet **[the melting Arctic and the remaining space are intensely
intertwined with geopolitics]{.underline}**. Back in 2007, **[Russia
dispatched a submarine to plant a titanium flag on the seabed four
kilometres beneath the North Pole, symbolically staking a claim to more
than a million square kilometres of seabed around the pole and the
billions of dollars of oil and gas reserves]{.underline}** thought to
lie therein. Although the act was interpreted as Russia thumbing its
nose at the rest of the world, **[it's clear that Moscow meant
business]{.underline}**.

'**[Culturally and historically, the Arctic is hugely important to
Russia]{.underline}**,' says Kennedy-Pipe. '**[But it's also important
militarily and for security as it provides access to the Atlantic
Ocean]{.underline}**. Now it also offers an opportunity to harvest oil
and gas. **[Russia sees an ice-free northern sea route as key for
transporting coal]{.underline}** to India and China, but it also looks
at a map and sees that **[it's a short distance for a nuclear missile to
travel]{.underline}** from North America over the Arctic. It will look
to defend its Arctic space vigorously.'

Last month, Russia extended its Arctic seabed claim by 703,000 square
kilometres, taking it right up against areas also coveted by Greenland
and Canada. The focus of this trio is the Lomonosov Ridge, a subsea
mountain range that stretches across the North Pole between Russia,
Greenland and Canada**[. If the ridge is proved to be part of a
continental shelf, it can be exploited by the owner of that
shelf]{.underline}**. Under the UN Law of the Sea, access to anything
beyond the continental shelf is prohibited, but this may soon change
(see Digging in the Deep Blue on page 25).

**[A carve up of the Arctic is an attractive proposition]{.underline}**

mineral resource wealth]{.underline}**. As in the case of **[Ukraine,
such an approach would reflect Trump's predisposition for transactional

#### It spills over to relations as a whole. Russia views REM cooperation as a way to get sanctions lifted, but the plan breaks the deal.

**[While Ukraine and the U.S. were negotiating the terms of the
agreement, Russia was]{.underline}** also **[seeking to get in on the
action]{.underline}**. Russian President Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}** this week **[offered the U.S. joint projects in
aluminum production, deposits]{.underline}** in eastern Ukraine, **[and
exploration of the Arctic]{.underline}**. This was the idea of Kirill
Dmitriyev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a source close to
the talks told Bloomberg. **[Dmitriyev had apparently persuaded Putin
that the way to develop relations with Trump was to "sell" him business
opportunities.]{.underline}**

At the moment, Russia has three offers on the table:

Putin stated that **[Russia's reserves of rare earth minerals are far
greater]{.underline}** than Ukraine's**[, and invited the U.S. to
cooperate]{.underline}** **[in their extraction]{.underline}** in
occupied areas of Ukraine. The Kremlin likely hopes that this will
become a route to the recognition of these areas as part of Russia.

Putin also said that Russia was ready to supply 2 million tons of
aluminium to the U.S. if the current prohibitive 200% tariff was lifted.
Putin offered the U.S. a joint aluminum production project in
Krasnoyarsk Krai, renewing unrealized Soviet-era plans to build new
aluminum factories powered by cheap hydroelectricity.

Finally, the **[Arctic]{.underline}**. While Putin has not mentioned
this publicly, Dmitriyev has done so -- and Bloomberg confirmed the
**[talks are real]{.underline}**. Russia is **[reportedly inviting U.S.
companies to take part in]{.underline}** oil, gas and rare earth
**[mineral extraction in the Arctic]{.underline}**, as well as investing
in the development of the Northern Sea Passage.

Of course, **[none of these projects could happen until Western
sanctions are]{.underline}** lifted. As things stand, **[the
sanctions]{.underline}**, which Trump last week extended for another
year, **[mean that any investment and joint projects are implausible for
now.]{.underline}**

Why the world should care

Both Ukraine and **[Russia see the U.S as a key player in the
conflict]{.underline}**, **[and want to curry favor with commercial
proposals]{.underline}**. But these **[commercial proposals are more
political than anything else]{.underline}**. With the deal, Ukraine was
trying to give the U.S. a stake in the conflict with Russia, halting a
push for peace on Russian terms. **[Russia]{.underline}**, meanwhile,
wants **[to encourage the U.S. to lift sanctions]{.underline}**. But
what happens now that the natural resources deal looks to have been
abandoned? There are two possibilities: either Trump pursues Russia
talks without Ukraine at the table; or he washes his hands of the entire
conflict.

**[The US and Russia are looking at joint energy projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, **[as part of the ceasefire negotiation in
Riyadh]{.underline}**, Russia's sovereign wealth fund boss Kirill
Dmitriev told Politico on February 19.

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, who
participated in the discussions, revealed that the talks were general
but covered \"specific areas of cooperation\" and several members of the
US team have admitted that **[energy was included in the discussion
topics]{.underline}**.

\"It was more a general discussion -- maybe **[joint projects in the
Arctic. We specifically discussed the Arctic]{.underline}**,\" Dmitriev
said.

Trump seeks to expand American influence in the Arctic and has
considered purchasing Greenland from Denmark, or even taking it by
force, because of its strategic location as well as its large deposits
of underdeveloped natural resources.

Previously, ExxonMobil collaborated with Russia\'s state company Rosneft
on Arctic hydrocarbon exploration but exited the project in 2018 due to
sanctions. Most of Russia's gas was exported to Europe from the Arctic
regions of the Yamal peninsula, the youngest of Russia's vast gas
fields.

The US educated Dmitriev is Russia's deal-maker-in-chief and worked on
several US-funded projects to develop Russia's capital markets in the
1990s before taking over the sovereign wealth fund in 2011. He has
extensive connections amongst leading US funds as well as good relations
with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East.

Notably one of the less high-profile members of the five-man Russian
delegation to the Riyadh talks is Vladimir Proskuryakov who works in the
Russian Embassy in Canada and specializes in Arctic affairs. The
delegation is led by veteran diplomats Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, so the presence
of a low-profile Arctic specialist on the small team is surprising.

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the US delegation in
the talks, hinted that **[business was high on the agenda]{.underline}**
**[and said that ending the conflict could "unlock a historic US-Russia
economic alliance".]{.underline}**

**[Trump has voted to make the US rich again by unlocking its "black
goal" and campaigned under the slogan of "drill, baby, drill" as he
intends to massively expand America's oil production]{.underline}**.
Amongst his first acts as president was to withdraw from the Paris
Agreement and so end the US commitment to reduce the use and production
of fossil fuels.

With the Western Siberian oil fields in decline, **[the main source of
production for most of the Soviet-era and the Eastern Siberian fields
underdeveloped and lacking transport infrastructure, the attention has
shifter the vast deposits in the Arctic regions and the Yamal peninsula,
which current account for the bulk of Russia's proven
reserves.]{.underline}**

### Link\-\--Military Activity (General)\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Military activity in the Arctic would end cooperation with Russia, no matter the size.

**Åtland 14** -- Senior Research Fellow with the Norwegian Defence
Research Establishment, PhD in Political Science from the University of
Tromsø, M.A. in Russian Studies from the University of Oslo.

Kristian Åtland, "Russian-Western Relations in the Arctic: Perceptions,
Policies, and Prospects," European Leadership Network, 03-25-2014,
https://europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/russian-western-relations-in-the-arctic-perceptions-policies-and-prospects/

**[Russian policymakers and media have in recent years had a tendency to
portray any foreign military activity]{.underline}** **[in the Arctic as
hostile and provocative, even when such activity takes place well
outside the country's territorial waters]{.underline}** **[or airspace
and does not infringe on recognized Russian rights]{.underline}**.
**[The Russians are concerned that foreign state or non-state actors may
try to take control of natural resources and/or shipping lanes
rightfully belonging to the Russian Federation]{.underline}**. According
to a recent statement by Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian
Security Council, the United States, Norway, Denmark, and Canada are
pursuing "a common and coordinated policy aimed at denying Russia access
to the riches of the Arctic continental shelf". In a somewhat similar
manner, Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, has stated on several
occasions that his country faces "**[increasingly aggressive Russian
actions]{.underline}**", necessitating adequate defensive measures.

Obviously, statements such as the ones cited above are often intended
for domestic audiences and should not necessarily be taken at face
value. At the same time, **[there are many indications that the security
concerns are genuine]{.underline}**, **[and that fear is a factor in
Arctic politics]{.underline}** also in 2014. **[Many Arctic states are
concerned that their neighbors or outside actors may attempt to infringe
on their rights and interests]{.underline}**, **[including the access to
natural resources]{.underline}** **[or shipping lanes]{.underline}**
**[of considerable value]{.underline}** **[to their national
economies]{.underline}**. **[None of the states that surround the Arctic
Ocean exclude the possibility of interstate disputes in the region, and
none of them are willing to rely on anyone except themselves to protect
their northern maritime borders, sovereignty, and sovereign
rights.]{.underline}**

**[For Russia]{.underline}** as well as for other Arctic rim states,
**[the stakes are undoubtedly high]{.underline}**. **[It is estimated
that some 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered reserves of natural
gas, and 13 per cent of the undiscovered reserves of oil, are located
north of the Arctic Circle]{.underline}**. Among the areas specified for
future development are Russia's Yamal Peninsula in northwestern Siberia
and the continental shelf in the Barents and Kara Seas. In a more
distant future, petroleum operations in areas further north and east may
become a reality. Russia will soon claim ownership to a shelf area of
1.2 million square kilometers (460,000 square miles) between the outer
limits of the country's current 200-nautical-mile economic zone and the
North Pole. Efforts are also taken to facilitate an increase in ship
traffic along the northern coast of the Eurasian continent. The annual
number of passages along this northern waterway is still fairly modest
(71 in 2013), but cargo volumes are growing year by year.

**[The Arctic coastal states' security concerns]{.underline}** on the
northern frontier **[are shaped not only by the region's emerging role
as an arena for economic and industrial activity, but also by the
region's place in the nuclear deterrence strategies of
Russia]{.underline}** and the United States. During the Cold War, the
Soviet Union and the United States developed long-range nuclear weapons
that could be launched across the Arctic Ocean, either from locations on
land, from the sea, or from the air. The number of deployed warheads has
been reduced significantly since then, but all elements of the nuclear
triads are still in operation and thus relevant to the security
situation in the region. The weapons have also become more
sophisticated, most notably with the development of land- and sea-based
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems, particularly after the collapse of
the ABM Treaty regime in the early 2000s. The latter development is
likely to remain a source of contention between the United States and
Russia, which sees sea-based ABM systems as a potential threat to its
nuclear deterrent in the Arctic.

When developing strategies to cope with future threats that might arise,
**[security analysts have a tendency to "assume the
worst",]{.underline}** **[that is, scenarios that do not necessarily
reflect the current state of affairs]{.underline}**. **[Not knowing the
(future) intentions of their neighbors or outside actors, they are
afraid to risk shortfalls in military capability, and may therefore
chose to "play it safe".]{.underline}** **[Based on their own
interpretation of other actors' intentions and military potential, they
may advocate measures to strengthen domestic military
capabilities]{.underline}**. Once implemented, **[these measures may be
perceived by other states as potentially threatening, and lead to
military or other counter-measures. In]{.underline}** the International
Relations literature, **[this phenomenon is often referred to as "the
security dilemma".]{.underline}**

Could **[there be a circumstance in the future under which Russia might
react in the Arctic as suddenly and aggressively as it did in
Ukraine]{.underline}**? The fourth factor we discuss relates to the
possibility that **[Russia may come to see an immediate threat in the
Arctic and respond by military means]{.underline}**. Although there are
". . . a wide spectrum of potential challenges and threats to the
security of Russia . . . being formed in the Arctic," as Russian Vice
Minister of Defense Nikolay Pankov put it in 2015,70 we **[focus on NATO
in particular because of a potential spill-over of current
tensions]{.underline}** in eastern Europe and around the Baltic**[, as
well as evidence that Russian leadership is fearful of a Northern
encirclement of Russia.]{.underline}** We first examine why **[the
Kremlin would pursue a potentially costly confrontation in a
region]{.underline}** that, as we have argued in our discussion of the
other factors, presents very limited reasons (if any) to **[raise
geopolitical tensions]{.underline}**. We then turn to some scenarios
related to NATO that Russia could employ to justify military response to
a threat in the region.

**[Domestic politics are an important factor]{.underline}** **[that may
play a role in whether Russia would react to a perceived provocation or
potential threat to its territory]{.underline}**. Russia's
**[Arctic]{.underline}** covers more than half of Russia's territory,
and **[provides 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product]{.underline}**.71 The Soviet Union invested massively in the
region and, after the economic difficulties of the 1990s were partly
overcome, **[Putin renewed large-scale investments in the Arctic and its
use domestically as a marker of Russian national
identity]{.underline}**.72 As a result, **[the Arctic is viewed in
Russia as an important domestic issue]{.underline}** **[before it is
viewed through an international or diplomatic lens]{.underline}**.73
**[Russia's Arctic could therefore be used as a nationalistic stake to
shore up domestic support]{.underline}**, **[particularly in times of
political and economic difficulties]{.underline}**.74

Several elements suggest that such a strategy is plausible. First,
**[the literature on the "rally-around-the-flag" effect supports the
notion that external conflicts boost domestic support for political
leaders,]{.underline}** at least in the short term.75 Putin experienced
this effect after the Ukraine crisis, when his popularity reached its
highest level ever in June 2015, with an 89-percent approval rate---up
almost 30 points from 2013.76 A second factor is Putin's focus on regime
survival.77 He is particularly wary of Russia being the location of
another "color revolution," a concern made more immediate by a series of
mass street protests in 2011--2012. This issue figures prominently in
Russia's 2015 National Security Strategy and, according to some
analysts, was one of the key reasons Russia intervened in Ukraine.78 In
this regard, the economic recession in Russia, borne out of Western
sanctions in addition to low hydrocarbon prices and capital flight,
increases pressure on the Kremlin. A third factor is Putin's "social
contract" with the Russian population that has been in place since his
return to the presidency in 2012, promising a great power status for
Russia again in exchange for a limitation of individual freedoms.79
Achieving that great power status in the eye of public opinion might
involve taking a more assertive stance in the Arctic, particularly if it
is in response to a perceived foreign provocation from NATO. A fourth
factor is the fact that the West---or, as seems increasingly likely, the
European Union80---lifting sanctions against Moscow actually could
increase internal pressure on Putin, who has found it convenient to
blame Russia's economic woes on foreign hostility and may have to look
for another rallying theme.81

The likelihood of Putin using the Arctic in such a way seems low, given
there is little evidence that public opinion has shaped his foreign
policy so far.82 However, public opinion has contributed to shaping some
elements of domestic politics---and the Arctic,83 being so closely
integrated with Russia's identity, as well as its economic and military
survival, blurs the line between foreign and domestic realms.84 Russia's
"defense" of its Arctic region could therefore be used for domestic
purposes, particularly if internal discontent rose to the point where
Putin feared for the survival of his regime. Such justification would
likely be used in combination with the perception, by both the Kremlin
and domestic audiences, of an external threat, lest Putin risk having
the population balk at a costly and senseless confrontation with the
West at a time of economic difficulties---potentially resulting in
precisely the type of internal contestation that the regime most wants
to avoid. NATO presents a plausible threat that, from Russia's
perspective, could justify military intervention in the Arctic.

**[There are a number of ways in which Russia could claim that NATO
displays an aggressive intent in the Arctic]{.underline}**; **[for
example, increased military presence of NATO members, or greater NATO
involvement as an organization in the region]{.underline}**. Since the
mid-2000s, all Arctic nations have undertaken to modernize or augment
their Arcticrelevant military assets, not unlike what Russia was doing
at the same time.85 In 2009, Norway moved its National Joint
Headquarters from the south of the country to Bodø in the North, and
invested in new frigates and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Denmark
established a joint Arctic Command in Nuuk (Greenland) and procured two
patrol vessels and four frigates that can all operate in first-year
ice.86 Although their efforts do not compare with Russia's in terms of
scale, they have also included large-scale exercises---such as Norway's
March  2015 exercises in Finnmark, the region bordering Russia, which
was also its largest winter exercise in that region since 196787---and a
higher degree of military cooperation. Sweden, for instance, promotes

https://www.e-ir.info/2015/09/01/the-global-commons-the-arctic-and-the-danger-of-a-sequel-in-outer-space/

Academics are becoming somewhat increasingly sceptical of how effective
future governance of the global commons will be based on the
ineffectiveness of its turbulent past. **[Managing the global commons is
a monumental task]{.underline}** and failures should not pose as
deterrents to those who aim to govern and preserve the commons. Instead
past failures experienced managing the commons should be understood as
lessons that comprise the learning curve of the commons. These lessons
should inform future decision making in the relatively new commons of
outer space and cyber space. This essay will explore the **[unique
security challenges]{.underline}** **[that states face when managing the
global commons of the Arctic and outer]{.underline}** space, presenting
specific problems in each of the commons and expressing proposed
solutions and some of their critiques.

The Global Commons in a Globalised World

"**[We have experienced races for arms in land, the sea and the air.
Outer space must not be another arena for an arms
race]{.underline}**."\[1\]

This essay has already alluded to a number of the commons that comprise
the global commons. Albeit, it is a prerequisite for this essay to
determine an explicit understanding of what constitutes a global commons
and its importance in a globalised world. The United National
Environment Programme defines the Global Commons as "resource domains or
areas that lie outside of the political reach of any one nation
State."\[2\] As previously mentioned these commons are generally
accepted to be the "sea, air, space, and cyberspace."\[3\] With an
exception to the latter, these commons have existed as long as time
itself however it is only through the phenomenon of globalisation that
the question of governing the Global Commons has grown in complexity and
urgency. Whether you agree or not with the scholars who express that
globalisation is a phenomenon of the 21st century, globalisation itself
has played a pivotal role in establishing gaps in the governance of the
Global Commons by its greater usage.

The World Health Organization understands that globalisation is "the
increased interconnectedness and interdependance of peoples and
countries" and is comprised of "two interrelated elements".\[4\] The
first is "the opening of borders to increasingly fast flows of goods,
services, finance, people and ideas across international borders" and
the second is "the changes in institutional and policy regimes at the
international and national levels that facilitate or promote such
flows."\[5\] The symbiotic relationship of the global commons and
globalization is all too evident as the commons act have acted as a
foundation for globalisation. Therefore, we can interpret that the
"Global Commons are first and foremost resources for interchange" and
additionally "infrastructure for interconnectedness in an ever more
globalized world."\[6\]

State Security Issues and the Management of the Arctic

Global warming has been the key factor in reshaping the Artic in to a
region of new strategic and commercial interest that poses opportunities
and risks to state security. The "melting Arctic ice transforms the
region from one of primarily scientific interest into a maelstrom of
competing commercial, national security and environmental
concerns."\[7\] One issue is the unresolved territorial claims largely
heightened with the opening of new Arctic shipping routes and the new
found accessibility of previously unreachable oil reserves. "Eight
countries have territory in the Arctic circle", which are "the United
States, Canada, Russia, Norway, and Denmark, through Greenland, which
are coastal states, plus Finland, Sweden, and Iceland."\[8\] \[9\]

"Due to climate change, the region's ice is melting, opening new
shipping lanes and offering access to undiscovered oil, gas, and other
mineral deposits."\[10\] This means there are actors outside of the
Arctic Eight, including non-state actors with a growing interest in the
future of the Arctic.\[11\]

**[There are two main areas of contention threatening state
security]{.underline}**. **[The first being "territorial issues" over
the "areas geographically beyond each state's legally recognized
exclusive economic zone]{.underline}**" and the second is "Transshipment
disputes".\[12\] An exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is expressed in the
"1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)" as "territorial
zones that extend up to 200 nautical miles from a country's
coastline."\[13\] States can achieve "limited extensions of their EEZ if
they can prove their continental shelf extends past the original
boundaries."\[14\] Arctic states are claiming "additional territory
beyond its EEZ in order to secure additional energy resources", however
"**[because]{.underline}** these **[boundary claims overlap, this
creates potential for conflict]{.underline}**."\[15\] One example are
the "conflicting claims by Russia, Denmark and Canada over the Lomonosov
and Mendeleev Ridges."\[16\] "In August 2007 Russian explorers planted a
titanium flag on the Lomonosov seabed" with intent to "send a message
about their perceptions of sovereignty to the other Arctic
states".\[17\] Even if this move appears aggressive, other actions such
as when "Vladimir Putin declared 3.7 million acres in the Russian Arctic
as a national park" seem to present that Arctic states will gain more
for cooperation than asserting sovereign rights.\[18\] However the U.S
Geological Survey contends that the "undiscovered conventional oil and
gas resources of the Arctic are estimated to be approximately 90 billion
barrels of oil, 1,669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion
barrels of natural gas liquids."\[19\] This means that approximately
"30% of the world's undiscovered gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered
oil lies hidden in the Arctic."\[20\] According to a report by Chatam
House in May 2014 at our "current consumption levels there are
sufficient resources for 50 years or more."\[21\]13. However "new
technology, especially that which allows drilling in deep water, also
potentially opens vast areas of the Arctic to oil and gas
exploration."\[22\] This affirms the argument that as resources continue
to become scarce the resource rich offshore areas of the Arctic region
will increasingly present itself as a valuable assets to states for
ensuring their own energy security.

The second area of dispute is again a by-product of climate change as
the melting of ice has meant the possibility of new Arctic shipping
routes that will be of great commercial and economic advantage to states
in a globalised world. The phenomenal rate of Arctic melt has meant
scientists have "projected that the region will become similar to the
Baltic Sea and will therefore become fully navigable on a year round
basis."\[23\] The first new route is "the Northwest Passage, previously
thought to be too treacherous to traverse."\[24\] It is of great
strategic interest as the "use of the North-West Passage over North
America could shorten shipping routes between Asia and the US east coast
by 5,000 miles."\[25\] Similarly "the Northern Sea Route over Eurasia is
also important since it shortens shipping routes between northern Europe
and north-east Asia by 40 per cent compared with the existing routes
through the Suez or Panama canals."\[26\] \[27\]

One area of disagreement is exhibited by allies Canada and the U.S as to
"whether the Northwest Passage constitutes an international strait or
forms part of Canada's internal waterways."\[28\] Many interpret
Canada's claim over the Northwest Passage not as a power play but as a
way to ensure security as "ships must respect Canadian regulations and
controls relating to safety, security, environment and Inuit
issues."\[29\] Howbeit academics see that the "Canadian claim of
internal waters to the Northwest Passage will set a worldwide precedent
and encourage other states to assert sovereignty over waters that are
currently considered to be international by law."\[30\] A "specific
country of concern is Iran, which would be likely to assert greater
national control over the Strait of Hormuz".\[31\]

State Security Issues and the Management of Outer Space

**[Outer space is an exorbitantly different global
commons]{.underline}** **[to that of the Arctic high
seas]{.underline}**. Our reliance on the Arctic region for shipping
routes and resources is comparable only to the use of outer space for
its capabilities of diffusion of information, in that sense it is closer
to the global commons of cyberspace. However the Arctic and outer space
unlike cyberspace occupy a physical space and therefore experience
similarities in terms of how they're governed. To a greater extent than
the Arctic the accepted location of **[outer space]{.underline}** by
scientists **[is still heavily contested]{.underline}**. The Fédération
Aéronautique Internationale established the conventional understanding
of the beginning of space at 100 kilometres above sea level. This
separation between the atmosphere and space has come to be known as the
"Kármán line after the person who calculated that aerodynamic lift was
impossible at higher levels without attaining orbital velocity."\[32\]
In the Digital Era there has been an "increasing reliance on the
peaceful uses of outer space".\[33\] However intertwined with this has
been the "**[increased understanding of the risks posed by unmitigated
space traffic and the dangers of weaponizing this
theater]{.underline}**."\[34\] **[The issues surrounding the management
of outer space can be concisely understood as the three C's "an
abbreviation for congested, competitive, and contested
space]{.underline}**."\[35\] Greater competition among states vying to
join the ranks of other space nations should be interpreted as positive
developments in world progress. However due to the congested nature of
space from the alarmingly increasing rates of space debris an
**[increasing number of satellites could mean a contested
commons]{.underline}**. **[There's a worry that the necessity of outer
space as a resource will mean states battle it out for space
supremacy.]{.underline}**

#### Icebreakers would threaten Russia's Arctic security and freak out Russia.

Contemporary Political and Social History from the Autonomous University
of Barcelona.

Sergey Sukhankin, "Russia Prioritizes Icebreakers in Scramble for Arctic
(Part One)," The Jamestown Foundation, 11-25-2024,
https://jamestown.org/program/russia-prioritizes-icebreakers-in-scramble-for-arctic-part-one/

**[Russia's geopolitical interpretation of Arctic affairs is a key
motivator for this project]{.underline}**. Despite Russia's official
rhetoric---which is reconciliatory, frequently quite deceptive, and
aimed at foreign audiences---analysis of specific issues and journals
shows how the **[Russian intellectual community views the Arctic region
primarily through the lens of geopolitical competition]{.underline}**.
An article published in specialized military journal Arsenal Otechestva
discusses the struggle for Arctic resources and Russia's place in the
Arctic generally, consisting of five "circles" of countries and
international organizations (Arsenal-otechestva.ru, May 4, 2023). These
include:

The so-called "Arctic countries," including Russia, the United States,
Canada, Denmark, and Norway, which have direct access to the Arctic and
have advantages in competing for Arctic resources;

Near-Arctic states, including Iceland, Sweden, and Finland;

International organizations consisting of Western countries (the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, and Nordic
organizations) that have recently become stakeholders in Arctic affairs;

The United Nations and specialized subcommittees, including the
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the United Nations
Environment Programme, the International Maritime Organization, and the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), that are not directly involved in Arctic affairs but perform
the role of an arbiter in the region;

Non-Arctic states represented by (unspecified) East Asian states and
some European countries.

According to Russia's logic, **[developments in the Arctic will be
primarily shaped by rivalry]{.underline}** **[between individuals and
groups of stakeholders, meaning that the leading indicator of success is
premised on the military capabilities of participants]{.underline}**.
**[One of the key tool]{.underline}**s **[that might have a decisive
effect on the unfolding struggle for the Arctic and its resources will
become icebreakers,]{.underline}** especially those that can perform
dual functions---transport and re-supply infrastructure---and perform
certain types of military operations if needed. Russia can rely on
several such icebreakers, including the Project 21180 Ilya Mutomets
icebreaker (introduced in 2017), which became the first military
icebreaker built for the Russian Navy in almost four decades, and the
Project 21180M Evpatiy Kolovrat icebreaker, which entered service in
July 2024.

In the next couple of years, two Project 23550 Arktika and one Yermak
icebreakers will enter service---the latter being specifically
commissioned by the Russian State Security Service (FSB) coast guard.
These icebreakers will be equipped with the following types of weaponry
and munitions:

AK-176 76-millimeter naval guns;

9K38 Igla man-portable infrared homing surface-to-air missile systems;

Various types of heavy machine guns; and

Platforms for Kalibr and Uran missiles.

Russian sources also claim that Russia would use civilian icebreakers
formally under the jurisdiction of the Rosatomflot to perform
(para)military tasks and functions if necessary (Topwar.ru, August 4).
The premier icebreaker of Russia's military flotilla, however, is the
Project 23550 Ivan Papanin, which went on sea trials in June 2024. This
multifunctional vessel combines the functions of an icebreaker, tow,
firefighting vessel, and warship. Due to its unique design and
construction, it can operate both in the Arctic---it is capable of
penetrating ice up to 1.7 meters (approximately 5.5 feet) in width---and
in tropical climates. According to Russian experts, the icebreaker is
equipped with Kalibr missiles with a 2,500-kilometer (1,600-mile) reach,
and due to its design, it could host various types of military
equipment. Russia plans to produce three analogs to Ivan Papanin vessels
in the near future (Octagon.media, July 26).

**[Currently]{.underline}**, **[Russia has a clear and undisputed
competitive edge in its arsenal of icebreakers in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. **[This supremacy, however, might be somewhat
diminished due to certain decisions taken by the Western coalition of
powers, which will be discussed in part two.]{.underline}**

#### That's particularly true because it would ruin Russia's Northern security.

To conclude the discussion of this factor, **[it is important to note
that the Arctic is an area of particular uncertainty with respect to law
and its interpretation]{.underline}**, which are still in their infancy
because they were of little interest until fairly recently. Further,
**[the melting of the ice boundary that traditionally protected Russia
puts it in a new security configuration that might alter its incentive
to abide by the law.]{.underline}** Previously, this **[ice protection
and Russia's access capabilities---with five times the number of
icebreakers as the next Arctic country]{.underline}**---**[ensured that
its influence in the region was largely accepted, no matter what the law
technically said.]{.underline}** **[With less of an ice boundary, Russia
may need different means to assert its status in the
region.]{.underline}**

#### Icebreakers would be perceived as Arctic militarization, which counters Russia's long-term interests.

In addition to signs of Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic, **[China
has launched a new icebreaker]{.underline}** and begun to invest heavily
in natural resources in Greenland. The United States has thus far met
this increased Russian and Chinese activity with a predominantly
militaristic response. But **[rather than building up military
forces]{.underline}**, **[the United States should be capitalizing on
e]{.underline}**xisting **[cooperative mechanisms]{.underline}** **[in
the region]{.underline}** such as the Arctic Council.

The U.S. militarization of the Arctic

While U.S. foreign policy has not historically been too focused on the
Arctic, in recent months, the **[Trump administration has looked to play
catch-up militarily to not only compete with, but also contain what it
considers threats from Russia and China.]{.underline}**

In June 2020, the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration released its
first policy paper on the Arctic --- **[calling for the construction of
three icebreakers]{.underline}** and four bases there by 2029.
Washington has also increased military exercises in the Arctic, reopened
a base in Nuuk, Greenland, and announced a \$12 million economic-aid
package for Greenland, a focus area for increased Russian and Chinese
commercial and military operations.

Indeed, in a speech at the Arctic Council last year, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo laid out the Trump administration's rationale: "**[Do we
want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught
with militarization and competing territorial claims?"]{.underline}**

Russia's long-term Arctic interest

While Washington's Arctic focus is relatively new, **[Russia's interest
in the Arctic is long-standing and has capitalized on American relative
inertia]{.underline}**.. With over 7,000 miles of Arctic coast (and 40
ice breakers in comparison to the U.S.'s two), **[Russia has seen the
Arctic region as essential to its security]{.underline}**. **[Russia has
responded in kind to the U.S. shift. In recent years, Russia has
reopened Soviet-era military posts, constructed new icebreakers, and
engaged in more military exercises]{.underline}**. **[Russia sees its
actions as part of an overall nuclear deterrence strategy]{.underline}**
as it hosts many of its sea-based nuclear assets in Murmansk, the
Barents Sea, and other Arctic waters. Moreover, 20 percent of Russia's
GDP originates in the Arctic --- making the region critical to its
economy. In 2020, Russia established a special commission to protect its
regional interests there --- specifically to analyze military-political
issues as well as social-economic concerns that arise.

### Link\-\--Climate Change\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Russia will get mad if they're excluded from climate discussions.

Arctic Institute

Pavel Devyatkin, "Can Arctic Cooperation be Restored?" The Arctic
Institute, 3-28-23,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/can-arctic-cooperation-restored/

Evidently, **[Russia places great importance]{.underline}** **[on its
position in the AC]{.underline}**. **[Russian experts and diplomats have
said Russia's exclusion is counterproductive]{.underline}** **[and
irrational]{.underline}**. **[Russian Ambassador]{.underline}** to the
United States, Anatoly Antonov, and Minister of Natural Resources,
Alexander Kozlov, have **[gone as far as calling it illegitimate and
claiming that the boycott violates the principles of
consensus]{.underline}** given that Russia is the chair of the AC during
this period. **[Russian and international scientists have also drawn
attention to data gaps that result from cutting off Russian Arctic
scientists]{.underline}**. **[Arctic climate research is crucial since
warming in the region is a bellwether for global climate
change]{.underline}**. As such statements demonstrate, **[Arctic
cooperation with Western states is important to Russia, especially in
regard to its recognition as a great power.]{.underline}**

#### That's particularly true because the U.S. and Russia approach climate change in drastically different ways, and the plan would freak Russia out.

**Meduza 25** -- a Russia Research Magazine.

Meduza, "Breaking the ice As the U.S. and Russia tease Arctic
cooperation, climate science could offer common ground --- but neither
side seems interested," Meduza, 04-22-2025,
https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/22/breaking-the-ice

Still, **[while the environment may be one of the areas with fewer
obstacles to cooperation]{.underline}**, Shumanov notes that the **[U.S.
and Russia approach the issue in fundamentally different
ways.]{.underline}** "**[If you compare the strategic documents of the
U.S. and Russia]{.underline}** --- which really shape each country's
policies and approaches --- **[you'll see vastly different emphases on
climate]{.underline}**," he said. "**[U.S. doctrine places far greater
importance on environmental sustainability and combating climate
change."]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**, by contrast, **[acknowledges climate change
mostly in terms of the benefits it brings]{.underline}**: **[easier
access to resources]{.underline}** and the Northern Sea Route.
"**[Environmental constraints]{.underline}**," Shumanov noted, "**[are
far less the focus]{.underline}**."

That also seems to be the case in practice. "**[Russia has permitted the
use of tankers with no ice class]{.underline}** to go through the Arctic
to transport oil from Europe, from the Baltic, to Asia," Moe said. The
shipments began in 2023, after sanctions left Russia cut off from the
Atlantic market. Since then, several vessels from Russia's so-called
"shadow fleet" have made the trip --- ships that are not only old but,
more critically, not ice-strengthened.

#### Russia doesn't want the plan BUT to the extent that they do, they only want multilateral, planned cooperation. Not the plan's unilateral policy.

**[Russia\'s foreign policy strategy considers climate

approach to global health, **[the strategy emphasizes]{.underline}** the
country\'s commitments to **[multilateral agreements]{.underline}**,
particularly the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, as important platforms
for climate diplomacy. **[In Russian foreign policy, climate change
receives more attention than global health, especially concerning
energy-related issues.]{.underline}**

Although **[Russia links domestic climate policy]{.underline}** **[and
national security]{.underline}**, **[Moscow has opposed treating climate
change]{.underline}** **[as a global security issue]{.underline}**. In
2021, for example, **[it blocked an attempt to place climate change on
the UN Security Council agenda]{.underline}**. It justified its position
by arguing that climate change is not a root cause of armed conflicts
and should not divert attention away from addressing the real causes of
war.

**[Under its climate strategy, Russian diplomacy seeks to]{.underline}**
introduce normative principles, develop legal regulations, support
economic measures to advance adaptation, **[develop]{.underline}**
scientific **[collaboration]{.underline}** and information sharing,
**[and]{.underline}** deepen **[international
cooperation]{.underline}**. Russia would like to strengthen
international verification of national developments on mitigation and
adaptation. Moscow also wants to increase international involvement in
Russia\'s carbon market.

**[Unpredictability]{.underline}** also **[suggests that special care
should be taken]{.underline}** **[to avoid]{.underline}** accidental
**[escalation of small-scale incidents]{.underline}**. **[This can be
done through supporting activities that bring the United States and
Russia together on Arctic issues]{.underline}**---**[for instance,
through institutions]{.underline}** (such as the Arctic Council, the
Arctic Coast Guard Forum, and the International Maritime Organization),
**[joint activities]{.underline}** (such as safety and environmental
exercises, collaborative scientific research) **[and information
sharing]{.underline}** (for instance, data related to commercial
shipping traffic). It could also be done by reducing Department of
Defense barriers to participating in international Arctic activities
that involve Russia when the focus is military support to civil
authorities (such as search-andrescue exercises). Another option would
be to create a forum dedicated to security issues beyond the existing
meetings of the Arctic Chiefs of Defense Staff.

**[Russia's increased vulnerability on its northern shore and
sensitivity to an increased NATO presence in the Arctic]{.underline}**
region writ large also **[suggests that even limited
incursions]{.underline}** of the Alliance for such activities as routine
exercises **[have the potential to fuel tensions]{.underline}** when
seen against the background of stronger support for NATO on the part of
Sweden and Finland. While this does not mean that NATO should in any way
halt its activities in the region, it suggests the necessity of striking
a balance between ensuring that NATO has some capability and experience
to support Arctic operations without establishing a presence of the
Alliance in the region that would create tensions between Arctic
nations, and particularly with Russia. This includes supporting measures
designed to strengthen NATO's ability to conduct operations in
cold-weather conditions and pursue efforts started at the 2014 Wales
Summit and confirmed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit to adapt to the new
threat environment.

Our third research question focuses on U.S. policy options that could
help mitigate the effects of the factors outlined above and contain
tensions. **[The fact that Russia's behavior in the Arctic could change
from cooperative to conflictual and is difficult to
foresee]{.underline}** **[warrants close attention]{.underline}** **[to
the region on the part of the United States]{.underline}**. As indicated
in the 2013 U.S. Arctic Strategy (which includes "Enhance Arctic Domain
Awareness" as an element of its first line of effort), monitoring of the
region may require encouraging improvements in Arctic region domain
awareness and access, through continuing and (as necessary) expanding

### AT: Arctic Cooperation Inevitable

#### Arctic cooperation is not inevitable. It can break down based on new updates.

Conclusion

This Essay has demonstrated how strategic planning on Arctic cooperation
has evolved over time, shaped by the foreign policy agendas of different
US presidents and military interventions, such as those in Georgia and
Ukraine, which influence policy decisions. Crucially, **[there is no
singular, monolithic US or Russian Arctic strategy]{.underline}**. **[As
Arctic cooperation strategies ebb and flow in response to military
actions, it can be argued that interests in this context are not fixed,
but rather are constructed through international
interactions]{.underline}**. Since **[interests are continuously
transformed]{.underline}** **[and reconstructed]{.underline}**
**[through these interactions, the current impasse in Arctic cooperation
is not permanent]{.underline}**. **[Russia will remain a central
consideration in US Arctic strategy, just as the US will be in Russian
Arctic strategy]{.underline}**; **[however, the dispositions towards
each other, particularly regarding cooperation, are impermanent and
subject to change]{.underline}**.

#### Russia's cooperation cannot be taken for granted.

**[Russia's cooperative stance in the Arctic cannot be taken for
granted]{.underline}**. **[Future behavior cannot be confidently
anticipated]{.underline}** **[on the basis of historical
patterns]{.underline}**, although the number of mechanisms (e.g., 
agreements, diplomatic organizations) through which Russia cooperates on
Arctic affairs could make it difficult to abandon this stance in rapid
fashion. Destabilizing the region would also limit Russia's potential to
benefit from its Arctic resources, which its national priorities clearly
indicate it wishes to do. Yet **[even economic factors will not
necessarily steer Russia toward cooperation]{.underline}** in the
future, **[particularly if its ambitions]{.underline}** for enhancing
its energy sector through northern oil and gas reserves **[grow
increasingly out of reach.]{.underline}**

#### This is based on the best methodology. Prefer it.

**[Our analysis of Russian foreign policy]{.underline}** **[and military
behavior in the Arctic]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** further
**[informed by a review of Russia's Arctic policy and
doctrine]{.underline}**; **[secondary sources on Russia's Arctic
Strategy and foreign policy]{.underline}**; **[and
conversations]{.underline}**, including during a roundtable, **[with
subject-matter experts knowledgeable about Russian Arctic
polic]{.underline}**y. Our analysis also relies on several assumptions:
First, we assume that Russia is a rational actor that tries to make
optimal choices in the Arctic; i.e., maximizing its benefits while
minimizing costs.1 "Benefits" are defined as those objectives Russia is
seeking to achieve in the Arctic based on its official Arctic doctrine.
In particular, this chapter examines how systemic factors (for instance,
climate) might increase costs for Russia. Second, we recognize that
Russia is not a unitary actor, as President Vladimir Putin's diplomatic
stance is constrained to some extent by the necessity to satisfy---or at
least not antagonize---domestic audiences, a notion that was popularized
by Robert Putnam's seminal work on two-level games.2 However, we also
recognize that Russia's Arctic policy is a centralized process in which
the Kremlin---and Putin in particular---play an outsized role.3 Third,
we borrow from liberal institutionalism theory when we note that
Russia's membership in many Arctic-centered institutions creates
conditions for more cooperation by providing forums where potential
disagreements may be discussed and solved before they escalate. Still,
we make this assumption secondary to the rational actor assumption,
noting that Russia could in theory pull out of these institutions if it
were to believe its needs were not being met anymore. Fourth, we agree
with Russia expert Marlène Laruelle that military and economic concerns
are deeply intertwined in the Arctic and that these concerns can, at
times, lead to apparently disjointed Russian policies in the region.4

**[This chapter finds that]{.underline}** while Russia's current
remilitarization of its Arctic region does not necessarily portend an
increased risk of conflict, Russia's actions and rhetoric with regard to
the Arctic have been inconsistent, alternating in recent years between
inflammatory and cooperative. **[While cooperation has been maintained
successfully over the years, none of the factors that made it in
Russia's interest to follow international norms and work with Arctic
partners will necessarily hold if circumstances change]{.underline}**.
As a result, Russia's intentions in the Arctic---whether belligerent or
peaceful---remain uncertain, particularly after the 2014 Russian
intervention in Ukraine that largely came about as a surprise and has
led to drastic reassessments of how well we can understand, and predict,
Russia's actions throughout its area of influence, which includes a
large portion of the Arctic.5

#### The link and internal link are empirically proven. Gradual deterioration in the U.S.-Russian relationship in 2014 spilled over to crush cooperation.

**[During the first post--Cold War decade, Russia approached the Arctic
as an area of low tensions, where cooperation with other
powers]{.underline}** in addressing common challenges **[was desirable
and feasible]{.underline}**.1 **[Gradually]{.underline}**, however,
**[as relations with the West deteriorated]{.underline}**, **[and
especially since its 2014 invasion of Ukraine, Russia has adopted a much
more competitive, even confrontational, perspective on the
Arctic]{.underline}**. Instead of emphasizing the benefits of
cooperative engagement, its leaders have articulated their view of the
Arctic as a sphere of military and economic expansion, and an arena for
their great-power ambitions.2 As a result of this changing attitude,
Moscow has prioritized military superiority to counter what it claims is
a growing U.S./NATO challenge to its interests there.

inherently beneficial for Russia to cooperate on Arctic
issues]{.underline}**. **[While destabilizing the region would limit
Russia's potential to benefit from its Arctic resources]{.underline}**,

analysis]{.underline}** of the second factor (increased interest in

reach]{.underline}**--- for instance, because of low hydrocarbon prices,

might engage instead in inflammatory actions and
rhetoric.]{.underline}**

Marisol Maddox, a senior Arctic Policy fellow at Dartmouth College's
Institute of Arctic Studies, spoke to the difficulty of re-building
cooperative mechanisms once they've been broken down. "**[We\'ve seen
that if you lose a cooperative mechanism]{.underline}**, if you kick
Russia out of something, or Russia fully leaves a body, **[it\'s much
harder to then build back that basic cooperative mechanism as opposed to
something like the Arctic Council]{.underline}**, which I think has
really masterfully handled the situation with Russia in the Arctic,"
Maddox said.

### AT: Russia Doesn't Want Cooperation

#### Russia does want cooperation, and evidence to the contrary is just for domestic audiences.

**[Russia's actions]{.underline}** and rhetoric with regard to the
Arctic have alternated between inflammatory and conciliatory,
**[creating some uncertainty regarding its intentions in the
region]{.underline}**. Russia has increased military presence in its
High North, but not to Cold War levels. **[Russian policy in the Arctic
has been mostly cooperative]{.underline}**, **[and inflammatory speeches
or events]{.underline}** (such as the planting of a Russian flag on the
seabed near the North Pole in 2007) **[may be best understood as aimed
more at a domestic audience]{.underline}** **[than an international
one]{.underline}**. Overall, **[Russia has benefited from its
cooperative stance]{.underline}** on Arctic issues for three main
reasons: First, **[the difficulties of operating]{.underline}** in such
a rigorous environment **[make it inherently beneficial to
collaborate]{.underline}**; second, a number of key Arctic issues---oil
spills, for instance---are transnational, therefore requiring collective
responses; and third, economic development and investments benefit from
a **[peaceful and cooperative environment---a factor of particular
importance to Russia]{.underline}**, which views the economic
development of the Arctic as a key strategic objective.

#### Russia has empirically preferred cooperation to competition.

**[Russia's discourse on the Arctic has mostly taken a cooperative
tone]{.underline}**. **[Russian authorities have]{.underline}** also
**[repeatedly argued against a competitive]{.underline}**, militaristic
**[vision of the Arctic]{.underline}**,43 and Rowe and Blakkisrud's
**[analysis of media coverage of the Arctic by the Russian
government--owned newspaper]{.underline}** Rossiiskaya gazeta from May
2008 to June  2011 **[shows a similar dominance of cooperative over
competitive tone]{.underline}**.44 **[Both 2008 and 2013 Russian Arctic
strategies mention at length the importance of keeping the Arctic as a
zone of peace and cooperation]{.underline}**.45

Yet some high-profile events and statements that present a much more
assertive and provocative tone have garnered media attention. Two
particularly noteworthy events were the planting of a Russian flag on
the bottom of the sea at the North Pole by Artur Chilingarov (a polar
researcher and special representative of President Putin for the Arctic)
and the unplanned visit to the Svalbard Archipelago of Rogozin, deputy
prime minister and head of Russia's Arctic Commission, in April  2015.46
Chilingarov stated about the Arctic: "Historically speaking, it is
Russian territorial waters and islands. Now, we are recovering it."47
Rogozin declared the Arctic to be "Russia's Mecca"48--- remarks that are
reminiscent of rhetoric used by the Russian power to justify its
aggression against Crimea.

One possible explanation for this duality of Russia's official discourse
is that the most **[inflammatory statements are likely aimed at the
Russian domestic audience]{.underline}**, **[particularly the
nationalistic-inclined part of the Russian electorate that supports
Putin]{.underline}**.49 This is not to say that they do not serve a
purpose with international audiences as well. As Zysk and Titley note,
Russia's more confrontational stance plays a deterrence role and keeps
potential geopolitical adversaries at bay.50 The importance of
"strategic deterrence in the times of peace" is actually mentioned in
Russia's 2013 Arctic Strategy.51 More generally**[, such statements are
also a way to remind the world that Russia is a great power---in the
Arctic and elsewhere---and should be regarded as such.]{.underline}**

#### Broad variety of examples.

Finally, it could simply be that **[Russia engages in discourse and
rhetoric that best serves its purposes at the time]{.underline}**.
**[Sending what seem to be mixed messages is not unusual for Russia or
many other world powers]{.underline}**, especially when there are many
intertwined issues and individuals operating within and outside of the
government. Importantly, Russia has thus far appeared to balance or
check its aggressive tone to the extent needed to preserve the benefits
of long-term regional cooperation, an issue we discuss further in the
next section.

Regional Cooperation Has Proven Resilient So Far

**[In spite of its military buildup and mixed rhetoric, Russia has
maintained a cooperative stance overall]{.underline}** **[with other
Arctic states over the years]{.underline}**. **[There are numerous
examples of cooperation]{.underline}** **[among Arctic nations in the
form of political and economic bodies, treaties and agreements, and
exercises]{.underline}** (See Table 2.1). **[The sheer diversity of
these forums and events]{.underline}**---**[from SAR operations to
science and the environment]{.underline}**---**[shows the number of
areas in which Russia has found it beneficial to work with other Arctic
nations]{.underline}**. The **[United States and Russia thus cooperate
in a number of activities and agreements that have provided a foundation
for generally peaceful bilateral and multilateral relationships on
Arctic affairs]{.underline}**. The presence of such diverse structures
for collaboration creates a kind of diplomatic safety net in the Arctic,
which may serve to deter or quell the potential for conflict. Should
tensions arise, these collaborative structures may even provide outlets
to voice discontent without resorting to overtly aggressive means.

But **[as the Trump administration's]{.underline}** own **[Arctic
ambitions and rapport with President Vladimir Putin grow]{.underline}**,
**[Moscow is seeking to leverage its Arctic riches]{.underline}** **[and
America's interest]{.underline}** **[to lobby for much-anticipated
sanctions relief]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[use the icy
region as a testing ground for rebuilding ties with the United

Speaking to reporters on March 13, President Donald **[Trump signaled
the Arctic is on top of America's priority list]{.underline}** and
reiterated his wish to get Greenland, a Danish territory. In remarks
Thursday from Murmansk, in Russia's Arctic, **[Putin spoke favorably of
those plans]{.underline}**, calling it a "profound mistake to treat it
as some preposterous talk."

Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy who has been ferrying messages from
Washington to Moscow, suggested in an interview with former Fox News
host Tucker Carlson that **[the United States and Russia are "thinking
about how to integrate their]{.underline}** energy **[policies in the
Arctic" and "share sea lanes, maybe send LNG gas into Europe
together]{.underline}**," referring to liquefied natural gas.

**[Russia, which saw an opening in Trump's business-first approach,

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, neither the first Trump nor Biden administrations did
anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban. **[Decreased dialogue between
Washington and Moscow only degrades diplomacy]{.underline}**,
**[exacerbates tension]{.underline}**, **[and increases the
unknowns]{.underline}**. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, the global situation has gone from bad to worse. It has
become particularly troubling in the **[Arctic]{.underline}** where
military and commercial activities continue to increase in scope and
scale and where there are no functioning forums---at the official
level---**[enabling Washington and Moscow to deescalate
tensions]{.underline}**. **[Absent a structured forum for deescalation,
the risk for miscalculation and escalation increases.]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic presents an opportunity for the Trump administration to
pursue pragmatic and more open engagement between Washington and Moscow,
specifically in the military and security space]{.underline}**. Such a
forum currently exists at the Track 2 level, but **[absent official
participation from Washington and Moscow decision makers, this forum's
efforts to curtail conflict will struggle.]{.underline}**

#### Arctic cooperation is key to spill over into other areas, including the Ukraine War.

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/putin-trump-and-the-arctic-prize-why-a-peace-deal-in-ukraine-could-change-everything

"Isn't it premature to **[talk of Western sanctions against Russia being
lifted]{.underline}**, **[and Western investors being invited to
participate in resource development]{.underline}** **[in
the]{.underline}** Russian **[Arctic]{.underline}**?" I posit. Everyone
can see that ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia are stalled; on
Palm Sunday, a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy
killed at least 34 people. Half of the U.S. Senate (25 Republicans and
25 Democrats) joined forces to introduce a bill to "sanction the hell"
out of Russia if Moscow doesn't engage in peace talks. U.S. President
Donald Trump threatens to impose secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian
oil if Moscow keeps blocking efforts to end the war in Ukraine. And on
Friday, Rubio told reporters, "If it is not possible to end the war in
Ukraine, we need to move on."

**[Geo-politics doesn't move in straight lines]{.underline}**, Tim
reminds me. In anticipation of a peace deal, the **[back-channels are
flowing]{.underline}**. There's even speculation that the **[Nord Stream
pipelines could be reactivated]{.underline}** --- allowing Europe to
return to importing Russian gas --- if Russia and Ukraine reach a peace
agreement.

In a March 21 interview with Tucker Carlson, Steve Witkoff, the U.S.
special envoy helping Trump navigate Ukraine and Gaza, suggested
**[Russia and America were considering "integrating their energy
policies in the Arctic," sharing sea lanes, collaborating on artificial
intelligence and sending liquefied natural gas "into Europe
together."]{.underline}**

**[A week later, at the Arctic Forum in the northern Russian city of
Murmansk, Putin's special envoy, Dmitriev, announced an investment fund
for Arctic development to attract partners from the Gulf and the

### AT: Broader Diplomacy Permanently Doomed

#### U.S.-Russia Arctic cooperation is necessary and sufficient to restore broader diplomacy with Russia.

**Mardasov 25** -- Researcher at the Middle East Institute and the
Russian International Affairs Council.

Anton Mardasov, "Can Arctic cooperation thaw US-Russia tensions?," Al
Majalla, 05-23-2025,
https://en.majalla.com/node/325707/politics/can-arctic-cooperation-thaw-us-russia-tensions

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, "**[Start small, think
big]{.underline}**." To some extent, **[that sentiment applied to the
agenda of the US-Russian talks in Riyadh in March, where the parties
unexpectedly revived the Arctic as a region for possible economic
cooperation]{.underline}**. Given the war in Ukraine and other
fundamental disagreements, such a scenario, beyond symbolic gestures,
seems unlikely. Nevertheless, **[Moscow and Washington seem intent on
sustaining the trend of normalising relations---and for this reason, one
can begin to dream.]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic and the North Pole did not arise by chance. It is clear
that American and Russian negotiators initially sought to separate
overall bilateral ties from the war in Ukraine]{.underline}**. It is
therefore no coincidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin included
Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, in the
negotiating team. **[His task was to energetically and clearly explain
the benefits of restoring investment and economic
cooperation]{.underline}** to a business-minded Donald Trump.

**[Moscow's emphasis on]{.underline}** potential **[collaboration in the
Arctic]{.underline}** **[seems logical]{.underline}**, given the US
president's assertive desire to gain control of Greenland and limit
China's activities in the region. **[There have]{.underline}**, after
all, **[been positive examples of cooperation in the
past]{.underline}**, including joint ventures between Russia's Rosneft
and US companies ExxonMobil and General Electric.

In 2014, collaboration between Rosneft and ExxonMobil led to the
discovery of a field in the Kara Sea with reserves of 130 million tonnes
of oil and 422 billion cubic metres of gas. However, the exploration was
affected by Western sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014, leading to
ExxonMobil's withdrawal from the project.

The Kremlin chose to publicly develop this theme during Putin's visit to
Murmansk, which was timed to coincide with US Vice President JD Vance's
visit to Greenland. During his participation in the 'Arctic: Territory
of Dialogue' forum, the Russian president called for cooperation with
the US in the Arctic and effectively voiced support for Washington's
claims to Greenland. He also pointed out that the question of Greenland
had nothing to do with Russia, while expressing concern that NATO
countries consider the North Pole a possible conflict zone. In
particular, the alliance's newest recruits, Finland and Sweden, have
been involved in military exercises in the territory.

At the same forum, Dmitriev announced Russia's plan to create a special
investment fund for Arctic development by the end of the year. This
fund, he claimed, would attract capital from partners in the GCC and "a
number of Western countries". He also noted the US has shown interest in
investing in Russia's Arctic region, including LNG projects.

On the one hand, the **[Kremlin's exploitation of the Arctic can be
viewed within the framework of Russia's diplomatic approach to the
current US administration]{.underline}**. **[Moscow is ready to
throw]{.underline}** decorative **[minor concessions to Trump in order
to prevent fundamental disagreements over Ukraine]{.underline}** **[from
interfering with the restoration of bilateral relations.]{.underline}**

Good cop/bad cop

Moreover, in his communication with the US, Putin uses the traditional
good cop/bad cop tactic, with the role of the good guy played by
Dmitriev. Experienced diplomats and security officials, meanwhile, are
left to play the hardliners. At the same time, the Russian president
realises that both groups are bound to compete with each other, leading
to more effective negotiations and honest reporting.

**[The Kremlin is]{.underline}** also **[well aware that Trump's Arctic
ambitions]{.underline}** -- such as acquiring Greenland, increasing
activity within the framework of the Icebreaker Cooperation Effort
(ICE), and purchasing icebreakers from Finland---are directly related to
the containment of Russia's Arctic expansion and the build-up of US
military infrastructure in the region.

At the same time, Washington's Arctic policy is not only related to
Trump's business acumen -- it follows on from previous administrations.
During Joe Biden's presidency, for example, the US made a qualitative
leap in Arctic policy. It mentioned the Arctic in its National Security
Strategy, adopted a new Arctic strategy, established the post of Arctic
ambassador, concluded an alliance with Canada and Finland, and initiated
large-scale modernisation of the joint North American Aerospace Defence
Command with Ottawa.

So, **[while Moscow and Washington continue to play geopolitical
chess]{.underline}**---anticipating and concealing their next
moves---**[dialogue helps reduce mutual misunderstanding.]{.underline}**

Prospects," Valdai Club, 03-14-2025,

**[Since the Ukrainian crisis]{.underline}**, and especially since the
outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022**[, US-Russia
relations have been on a downward spiral]{.underline}**, a trajectory
many believed would remain "stable" for a long time, even after the
conflict's end. **[However]{.underline}**, **[almost
overnight]{.underline}**, without any prior warning**[, the United
States changed its policy]{.underline}**, **[initiated dialogue with
Russia]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** quickly **[began efforts to
restore relations]{.underline}**. Simultaneously, US-EU relations
deteriorated, and Ukraine was effectively abandoned by the United
States. In the history of great powers, **[such a sudden and subversive
shift in a country's diplomatic trajectory]{.underline}**, without any
fundamental changes in conditions, **[is extremely rare]{.underline}**,
though not unprecedented. This development defies the general laws of
international politics. **[The changes in the United States have
dramatically altered the international landscape]{.underline}** and
significantly transformed the course of Russian-American relations.

US-Russia relations have experienced numerous ups and downs over the
past three decades. In the early 1990s, under the enthusiastic efforts
of Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, the two nations entered a
"honeymoon period," and in 1993, they declared themselves strategic
partners. However, this optimism was short-lived. Due to NATO's eastward
expansion, the Kosovo War, and disputes over Iran, Iraq, arms control,
Chechnya, and other issues, US-Russian relations deteriorated into a
"cold peace."

The inaugurations of George W. Bush Jr. and Vladimir Putin in 2000
renewed hopes for improved relations. Following the September 11
terrorist attacks in 2001, US-Russian relations warmed rapidly, reaching
a level of near "comrades-in-arms." In May 2002, George W. Bush Jr.
visited Russia and announced a new strategic partnership between the two
countries. However, this rapprochement did not last long. After the US
launched the Iraq War in 2003, US-Russian relations cooled once again.

In 2008, both the United States and Russia underwent presidential
transitions, with Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev assuming office. This
renewed optimism in US-Russia relations led the Obama administration to
propose a "reset" strategy. While relations improved slightly, the
effort was underpowered and hesitant. The "reset" proved unsustainable
even before Medvedev's presidency ended and was definitively abandoned
when Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012. The Ukraine crisis followed,
along with a series of conflicts and sanctions against Russia, driving
US-Russian relations to a new low.

In 2017, Trump, who was widely perceived as sympathetic toward Russia,
became the US president. Many predicted that he would usher in a new era
for US-Russia relations. Contrary to these expectations, however,
domestic political constraints in the United States not only prevented
any improvement but further strained the relationship. The US began
supplying weapons to Ukraine and imposed additional sanctions on Russia.
During a heated exchange with Zelensky in the Oval Office on February
28, 2025, Trump proudly declared that while his predecessor had given
Ukraine "sheets," he had provided missiles.

**[What, then, are the prospects for US-Russia relations this time? Will
the two nations repeat the cycle of past failures, or will they break
free from this seemingly fatalistic pattern?]{.underline}**

**[This latest shift in US-Russia relations differs from previous ones
in several important ways]{.underline}**, **[the most notable being that
it has alleviated some of the persistent contradictions that have
plagued the bilateral relationship since the Cold War.]{.underline}**

### Diplomacy Impact\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Strong Arctic diplomacy is key to global arms control and preventing nuclear war.

Science Research and Extension and Professor of Polar Studies and
International Relations at Mahatma Gandhi University.

Geopolitical Signals for the Arctic," The Geopolitics, 11-15-2024,
https://thegeopolitics.com/russias-nuclear-strategy-trumps-re-election-and-the-geopolitical-signals-for-the-arctic/

**[Beyond the Arctic, the global arms control situation is under severe
strain]{.underline}**. **[The suspension of]{.underline}** the **[New
START Treaty]{.underline}** by Russia in early 2023, following years of
strained U.S.-Russia relations, **[has left the world without a crucial
framework for nuclear transparency and limitations]{.underline}**.
**[The treaty]{.underline}**, which was last extended in 2021, **[had
been the final remaining arms control agreement]{.underline}** between
the two nuclear superpowers, capping deployed strategic warheads and
providing mechanisms for inspections and data exchanges.

**[Without robust arms control agreements]{.underline}**, **[the risk of
nuclear escalation becomes significantly higher]{.underline}**. **[As
the nine nuclear powers]{.underline}**---Russia, the U.S., China,
Britain, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea---**[continue
to enhance their arsenals, the possibility of
miscalculation]{.underline}** **[or unintended escalation
grows]{.underline}**. **[The current environment]{.underline}**,
**[characterized by a lack of diplomatic dialogue and increasing public
threats of nuclear strikes, is reminiscent of the most dangerous periods
of the Cold War.]{.underline}**

UN Secretary-General António Guterres's warning that "**[humanity is on
a knife's edge]{.underline}**" reflects the urgency of the situation.
**[The combination of nuclear modernization, lowered thresholds for use,
and the decline of arms control measures creates a volatile mix that
could have catastrophic consequences for global security.]{.underline}**

**[The Need for Renewed Diplomacy]{.underline}** and Cooperation

**[As the Arctic becomes a new front in the global power struggle, there
is an urgent need for renewed diplomatic efforts to manage the
risks.]{.underline}** The Arctic Council, once a platform for
cooperation on environmental and security issues, has been sidelined by
geopolitical tensions. **[Reinvigorating]{.underline}** such
**[multilateral forums]{.underline}**, alongside strengthening
international agreements on nuclear safety and non-proliferation,
**[could help mitigate the risks.]{.underline}**

#### Indirect political talks between the U.S. and Russia spill into nuclear risk reduction. That's key to prevent existential nuclear war.

former Chief U.S. negotiator of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
with Russia.

Rose Gottemoeller, "The Role of U.S. Diplomacy in Countering Russia's
Nuclear Threats and Misbehavior," The Strategist, Spring 2023,
https://tnsr.org/2023/03/the-role-of-u-s-diplomacy-in-countering-russias-nuclear-threats-and-misbehavior/

In diplomacy, **[problem-solving through dialogue and deterrence
messaging go hand-in-hand]{.underline}**. In that way, **[diplomacy is
an essential aspect of integrated deterrence]{.underline}**, which draws
on all elements of U.S. national power. The Biden administration
introduced the concept in its 2022 national security strategy, stressing
that it would integrate capabilities "to leverage the full array of
American advantages, from diplomacy, intelligence and economic tools to
security assistance and force posture decisions."46

**[Nowhere is diplomacy more important than in the nuclear
realm]{.underline}**, **[where escalation must be avoided at all
costs]{.underline}**. **[Threats of nuclear use are]{.underline}** about
**[an existential threat to humanity]{.underline}**. **[They
should]{.underline}** therefore **[be treated as]{.underline}** problems
of importance and **[priority to humanity as a whole]{.underline}**.
Attempts to address them are not "rewards for bad behavior" or
"responding to nuclear blackmail."

**[If a productive process can be established and sustained, then
America will be better off than it is today in terms of its ability to
deter Russian nuclear threats.]{.underline}** At a minimum, Washington
will have **[strengthened lines of communication]{.underline}** that
will **[afford it more opportunities both to deter and to challenge
threats put forward by politicians in Moscow]{.underline}**. At a
maximum, the United States will have bolstered a deterrent against
Russian nuclear use by reestablishing the shared interest in a stable
nuclear relationship that the two countries have developed over the past
60 years.

**[This shared interest was best expressed in the Reagan-Gorbachev
statement that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought.]{.underline}** Ironically, Russia, the United States, China,
France, and the United Kingdom reiterated this statement in January
2022, less than two months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.47 As the
two largest nuclear powers, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia have a special responsibility to
ensure that these weapons are controlled and limited]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** that **[they do not proliferate]{.underline}**
into other hands. That partnership has been responsible for ensuring
that the number of nuclear weapons in the world has been on a downward
trajectory since the late 1960s.

**[If it is able to achieve success at the negotiating
table]{.underline}**, the United States will show that it is determined
to change the status quo without resorting to the use of force. In this
case, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will be
acting on behalf of all humanity in defusing nuclear threats that, if
enacted, could lead to global nuclear conflagration]{.underline}**. It
will be a worthy test of the role of diplomacy in U.S. deterrence
strategy.

#### The only way to uphold arms control, minimize proliferation, and prevent nuclear war is by increasing U.S.-Russia cooperation.

**[Understanding the]{.underline}** potentially **[apocalyptic
consequences of nuclear war]{.underline}**, **[it is clearly in the
national security interest]{.underline}** **[of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to reduce nuclear
risks.]{.underline}** **[This necessitates a]{.underline}** multilayered
**[effort to slow the spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline}** **[and
technologies]{.underline}**, **[reduce nuclear
stockpiles]{.underline}**, **[secure nuclear materials]{.underline}**
**[and prevent the proliferation of delivery systems]{.underline}**
**[for nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. **[None of these
efforts]{.underline}** **[can]{.underline}** **[be]{.underline}** truly
**[successful without the help and cooperation of the Russian
Federation]{.underline}**. Indeed, the **[Russian impact on U.S. nuclear
risk reduction goals cannot be overstated]{.underline}**. **[Russia's
arsenal constitutes over 45 percent of the global nuclear
stockpile.]{.underline}** Those weapons are coupled with delivery
systems that could reach American soil in about 30 minutes, **[meaning
Russia presents a clear and ever-present existential nuclear
threat]{.underline}** to the United States. **[U.S.-Russian bilateral
nuclear risk reduction efforts have produced successes in the
past,]{.underline}** but those efforts are now fading and failing.
**[Should the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[want to
continue to reduce nuclear threats]{.underline}** **[in the 21st
century,]{.underline}** **[it has no choice but to engage in a
reinvigoration of nuclear policy dialogue]{.underline}** **[and
cooperative activities with Russia.]{.underline}**

**[Nuclear tensions]{.underline}** between the United States and Russia,
and **[around the world, are now at the highest levels seen since the
end of the Cold War]{.underline}**. **[These conditions mandate that the
United States take a leadership role in stabilizing the
situation]{.underline}**. That will require some immediate actions,
including extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)
and managing the aftermath of the collapse of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).

There are also longer-term steps the United States can take to
facilitate **[cooperation and dialogue with Russia]{.underline}** that
**[will aid in its goal of reducing nuclear threats. Washington, working
with Moscow, will need to rebuild]{.underline}** teams capable of
producing a new generation of **[arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}** agreements. **[It will also be necessary
to restart dialogues]{.underline}** and deal with longstanding
grievances, including treaty compliance, confusion about each other\'s
doctrines relating to nuclear use and missile defense. These
interactions should be regularized and protected from broader challenges
the United States faces from Russia. Beyond that, substantive
discussions over nuclear issues need to be reinvigorated and broadened
to include emerging threats like hypersonic weapons and the
incorporation of artificial intelligence into strategic command systems.
These discussions cannot be sporadic fora in which to enumerate past
grievances; rather they should encourage bold and creative thinking
about the future of both arms control and nonproliferation.

**[Russia]{.underline}** also **[benefits from stability in the Arctic
because it helps]{.underline}** **[enable the economic
development]{.underline}** **[and investment]{.underline}** **[it
aspires to bring to the region]{.underline}**. **[The difficulty of
extracting resources]{.underline}** **[requires]{.underline}** large and
long-term investments, as well as public-private **[partnerships to
bring the appropriate technology to the areas to be
exploited]{.underline}**.65 This last point is of particular importance
to Russia, which emphasized in its 2008 Arctic Strategy the "use of
Russia's Arctic zone as a strategic resource base of the Russian
Federation" to spur socioeconomic development, one of Russia's main
national interests.66 **[Without cooperation]{.underline}** **[and
a]{.underline}** generally **[peaceful environment]{.underline}** in the
region, Russia **[would be hard pressed to develop, sell, and transport
Arctic natural resources to global markets]{.underline}**. **[High
tensions]{.underline}** in a region in which it is otherwise so
difficult to operate would **[severely delay]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}** **[altogether inhibit]{.underline}** economic
**[prospects]{.underline}**. Russia's emphasis on economic development
over defense in the Arctic makes particular sense in the absence of an
immediate external threat to economic resources, strategic assets, or
influence. These circumstances are vastly different from Ukraine, where
Russia perceived a credible threat to its influence and geostrategic
interests that seems to have outweighed the economic repercussions.

As the temperature rises three times faster than the annual global
average due to the climate crisis, **[the Arctic region is facing
unprecedented changes. To protect its fragile ecosystems, international
cooperation is essential]{.underline}**. For the last three decades,
eight members of the Arctic Council (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, **[United States and]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}**) **[have been cooperating on research aimed at
protecting local flora and fauna]{.underline}**. But due to Putin's
invasion of Ukraine, **[work with Russia has been paused, putting the
sensitive ecology of the region at risk]{.underline}**.

As **[Russia controls more than half of the Arctic
coastline]{.underline}**, the lack of its active involvement in the
council has weakened the body. About one-third of the council's 130
projects are currently on hold and new initiatives cannot be put in
place. Nikolay Korchunov, Russian Arctic Ambassador, told Reuters, that
he doubts whether the Arctic Council \"will be able to remain the main
platform on Arctic issues."

The **[consequences can be dire]{.underline}**. WWF reports that **[sea
ice in the Arctic is vanishing at an alarming pace]{.underline}**,
**[and if urgent action is not taken, "polar bears could face starvation
and reproductive failur]{.underline}**e by 2100." On top of
climate-related stresses, the Arctic has to cope with the impacts of
intensified drilling for oil and gas. Regrettably, the **[stalled
cooperation between Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the
**[other]{.underline}** Arctic Council **[members translates to an
ineffective response to these changes]{.underline}**.

In the past, the council has introduced binding agreements on

Evidently, Russia places great importance on its position in the AC.
Russian experts and diplomats have said Russia's exclusion is
counterproductive and irrational. Russian Ambassador to the United
States, Anatoly Antonov, and Minister of Natural Resources, Alexander
Kozlov, have gone as far as calling it illegitimate and claiming that
the boycott violates the principles of consensus given that Russia is
the chair of the AC during this period**[. Russian and international
scientists have also drawn attention to data gaps that result from
cutting off Russian Arctic scientists]{.underline}**. **[Arctic climate
research is crucial since warming in the region is a bellwether for

envoy in U.S. negotiations, Kirill Dmitriev, recently said on X.

At the Arctic Forum in Murmansk last week, Dmitriev announced that
Russia would set up a special investment fund for Arctic development by
year's end that would attract funds from partners in the Persian Gulf as
well as "a number of Western countries." Dmitriev also said the United
States showed "interest" in investing in the Russian Arctic region,
including in LNG projects.

For Trump, expansion in the Arctic can be a way to resell cheap energy
or buy minerals and rare earth metals from Russia, experts said.
**[Cooperation with Russia]{.underline}** would also be a way to stave
off the growing interest of China, which has declared itself "a
near-Arctic state," and is building its own icebreaking fleet to explore
the emerging trade routes.

For Russia, this **[presents an opportunity to access the LNG
technologies]{.underline}** it lacks and revive some of its key revenue
makers, which have been hindered by sanctions since the invasion of
Ukraine.

"**[When it comes to Arctic, Russia has a lot to offer]{.underline}**,"
said Russian economist and Arctic expert Vladislav Inozemtsev. **["It is
also something Russia cannot fully develop on its own."]{.underline}**

In February, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, met with U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and floated the idea of American
companies returning to Russia to collaborate in joint projects in the
Arctic. A few weeks later, Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign

hydro-acoustics --- are challenged by changes in seawater quality and
salinity.6 Boreal wildfires also require military assistance to aid
overrun civilian responses. Most importantly, climate change means more
physical access to the Arctic across all domains. As the civilian (e.g.,
commercial shipping, resource extraction, fishing, tourism) and military
(e.g., standing forces and constabulary operations) presence increases
in Arctic waters and skies, **[more incidents and accidents will
undeniably happen]{.underline}** --- especially risks linked to
environmental degradation due to environmental catastrophes and
human-made disasters (especially radioactive waste management in
Russia).7 Unfortunately, the most affected are likely to be local and
Indigenous communities.8

Russia began reinvesting in Arctic affairs in the mid-2000s.9 **[The
Kremlin remains adamant in asserting complete control over the
Arctic]{.underline}** Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF),
**[extending defense in depth through interdiction capabilities away
from the Russian Arctic, and protecting perceived vital interests along
the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}** (NSR). **[Russia has been rapidly
militarizing NSR approaches]{.underline}**, especially across critical
choke points,10 and modernizing local infrastructure.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. In Moscow's
calculations, receding sea ice coverage means that the once "natural"
border no longer offers sufficient protection. The Kremlin consequently
fears that the US and NATO will soon increase surface, subsurface, and
air deployments closer to the AZRF. **[This situation is fraught with
miscalculation and tactical errors that could lead to dangerous
escalation with global consequences.]{.underline}**

**[This fear has been amplified by Sweden's and Finland's NATO
accession]{.underline}**, fueling a sense of encirclement12 and
vulnerability.13 Ukrainian drone strikes on the Olenya air base,14 home
to strategic aviation assets, in July 2024, raises the question of how
potent Russia's multilayered defense capabilities truly are.

### Artic Relations Low\-\--1AR

#### Russia is cooperating with China, not the U.S.

**Mehr 25** -- Contributor at The Moscow Times.

Avesta Afshari Mehr, "Strategic Alliance or Uneasy Tango for Russia and
China in the Arctic?," The Moscow Times, 02-11-2025,

**[The Arctic]{.underline}**, rich in untapped energy reserves and
offering shorter global shipping routes, **[is becoming a key theater of
great power competition]{.underline}**. **[Russia]{.underline}**, long
the dominant player in the region, **[finds itself increasingly isolated
from the West due to sanctions]{.underline}** **[imposed after its
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[Now China enters --- eager to
expand its influence in the Arctic and willing to leverage Moscow's
economic vulnerabilities.]{.underline}**

On the surface, **[Russia and China appear to be forging and deepening
an Arctic alliance]{.underline}**. **[China is investing in Russian
energy projects, collaborating on infrastructure along the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}** (NSR) **[and advocating for a greater role in
Arctic governance]{.underline}**.

But is Beijing a true partner, or merely exploiting Russia's weakened
position? As the Arctic opens up, is Moscow still the master of its icy
domain, or is it unwittingly handing Beijing the keys to the north?

**[China has long sought to expand its presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, despite not being an Arctic state. In 2018,
Beijing declared itself a "near-Arctic state" and unveiled its policy
toward the region, emphasizing scientific research and economic
development. But its true ambitions lie in securing energy resources,
trade routes, and strategic leverage in Arctic governance.

**[Western sanctions have given China the perfect
opening]{.underline}**. **[With European and American firms forced to
withdraw from Russian Arctic projects, Chinese state-owned enterprises
have stepped in to fill the gap]{.underline}**. **[Beijing
has]{.underline}** covertly **[continued support for Russia's Arctic LNG
2 project]{.underline}**, despite Western attempts to block funding.
**[This not only secures China's access to vital energy supplies but
also strengthens its foothold in the Arctic economy]{.underline}**,
making it an indispensable partner to Moscow.

China's investments in Russian infrastructure, ports, and icebreaker
technology also point to a long-term strategy of Arctic entrenchment.
**[The question is how much control is Russia actually ceding in
exchange for Chinese support?]{.underline}**

The NSR, running along Russia's northern coast, is central to both
nations' Arctic strategy. By offering a shortcut between Europe and
Asia, **[the NSR challenges traditional routes like the Suez
Canal.]{.underline}** Russia has long sought to develop it as a major
shipping corridor, but evidently lacks the capital and infrastructure to
do so alone. **[China, with its vast financial resources and Belt and
Road Initiative has eagerly stepped in.]{.underline}**

**[Beijing is heavily involved in NSR projects]{.underline}**, from
financing Russian icebreakers to investing in Arctic ports. In theory,
this cooperation is mutually beneficial: Russia would gain much-needed
investment while China secures a faster trade route. **[However, the
balance of power in this partnership is shifting in China's favour. As
Chinese shipping firms gain greater influence over the NSR, Russia risks
becoming a mere enforcer rather than a true stakeholder.]{.underline}**

#### Direct U.S.-Russia cooperation is doomed because of Ukraine, but non-state actors solve.

**Devyatkin 23** -- Senior Associate at the Arctic Institute, Lecturer
and PhD Fellow at the Higher School of Economics.

Pavel Devyatkin, "Can Arctic Cooperation be Restored?," The Arctic
Institute, 03-28-2023,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/can-arctic-cooperation-restored/

Despite the **[breakdown of relations]{.underline}** **[between Russia
and the seven other Arctic states]{.underline}**, **[there is still
limited room to restore cooperation today]{.underline}** -- primarily
**[between non-state actors]{.underline}**. As the Arctic faces a
climate emergency that threatens the whole world, cooperation in
research to understand the dramatic changes unfolding in the region, in
environmental protection, and in joint climate change adaptation and
mitigation efforts remain imperative for all involved.

In the context of the pause of the Arctic Council (AC), **[cooperation
between non-state actors may be the most important form of cooperation
now]{.underline}**. Science and citizen diplomacy remain important.
**[Researchers, Indigenous peoples, non-governmental organizations, and
civil societies may be able to influence states to reignite
intergovernmental cooperation]{.underline}** **[as such non-state actors
and non-aligned states pressured the superpowers during the Cold War to
converge on issues of common interest]{.underline}** -- especially
around climate change and environmental protection. The Cold War holds
many lessons for the contemporary situation and thinking about restoring
cooperation in the midst of steep political tensions.

The freezing of state-to-state cooperation: Russian reactions

**[We are witnessing a severing of state-to-state cooperation after
Russia's military actions in Ukraine]{.underline}**. Right up until
February 24, 2022, there was effective interstate circumpolar
cooperation across various institutions and frameworks. Even just the
day before, on February 23, 2022, Russia's ambassador to Norway read an
opening speech written by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the
Kirkenes Conference in the Norwegian Arctic. The speech mentioned
"mutual assistance and good-neighborly relations" in the Arctic and
complimented the Kirkenes conference as a setting for "constructive and
depoliticized discussion of the pressing issues of international
cooperation."1)

From my experience as an American scholar based in Russia during this
volatile period, I believe most Russian decision makers would still be
supportive of Arctic cooperation, but **[government-level cooperation,
such as collaboration between state funded scientists, more difficult
than ever is.]{.underline}** Some **[Russian decision makers are wholly
pessimistic about the return of cooperation]{.underline}**. Alexey
Drobinin, director of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MFA)
policy planning department, said, "**[The period of constructive
cooperation between Russia and Western countries is gone for good,
regardless of the outcome of Russia's special operation in
Ukraine]{.underline}**."2

#### This trend has been structurally true for a long time.

History to NATO-Russia Relations in the Arctic," The Arctic Institute,

NATO is not responsible for the war in Ukraine, nor should its expansion
be used to legitimize Russia's unprovoked and reprehensible war against
its sovereign neighbor. That being said, **[NATO expansion
has]{.underline}** also **[contributed to the decline in Russia-West
relations]{.underline}** since 1989. **[Until we are prepared to
confront this reality in the West, we risk repeating the past.
Adversarial relations]{.underline}** **[have elevated the threat
environment in the Arctic, with both NATO and Russia perceiving each
other as potential aggressors]{.underline}**. With all Arctic nations
(apart from Russia) now belonging to NATO (the Arctic Seven), **[the
Alliance features prominently in Russian framing of the Arctic as a
potential threat to its energy and sovereignty interests
there]{.underline}**. **[Since the end of the Cold War the Arctic was a
region of cooperation, but is now facing adversity]{.underline}**,
**[driven by Russia's war in Ukraine]{.underline}** **[and the state of
NATO-Russia relations.]{.underline}** As war ravages Europe, and Russia
is once again considered an adversary -- or by some accounts an enemy --
it is important to understand how this influences its approach to the
Arctic.

**[Western nations failed after the Cold War to find a path toward
normalizing relations with Russia]{.underline}**,1) arguably to our
detriment, **[and we risk continuing to make the same
mistakes]{.underline}** **[if we delegitimize Russia's insecurities
about NATO, all of which could have unfortunate consequences for the
Arctic]{.underline}**. **[How Russia frames its Arctic interests is
increasingly affected by its wider relations with the
West]{.underline}** **[because NATO is now a much larger presence there
with the accession of Finland and Sweden]{.underline}**.2) Russia has
invested in military development in the Arctic as a means to flex its
power capabilities in the region, and to defend its interests and
sovereignty in a region critically linked to its economic future.

This article draws on some of the leading critics of the West's approach
to Russia, who lament the failure to acknowledge Russian security
concerns and the actions that delegitimize them. To consider Russian
perspectives on NATO is not akin to accepting Russian brutality in
Ukraine. **[The West's failure to normalize relations with Russia has
been consequential, and NATO is now viewed by Russian officials as
emblematic of Western disregard for Russian security interests in
general and its Arctic interests in particular]{.underline}**.
**[Russian Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Sergei Lavrov **[responded to
the US]{.underline}** Department of Defense's 2024 **[Arctic Strategy by
decrying]{.underline}** NATO's increased **[military exercises in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, noting Russia's readiness to respond.3)

If heightened conflict is to be avoided -- a goal all Arctic nations
ostensibly share -- then normalizing relations with Russia, free from
the encumbrances of unmet and unrealistic expectations, may be useful.
This paper takes a high-level view of Russia-West relations in general,
with implications for the Arctic, and suggests a possible path forward
by learning from past missteps, and reframing relations with Russia.

Past As Prologue? Tensions and Missed Opportunities in Russia-NATO
Relations

**[Russian intentions have]{.underline}** often **[been perceived
suspiciously by American leaders]{.underline}**,4) **[even during times
of cooperation]{.underline}**. **[This is visible in the Clinton, Bush,
and Obama administrations, all of whom adopted a hedging
strategy]{.underline}** against a potentially resurgent Russia, which
justified the expansion of NATO.5) This approach assumed that what was
once true of Russia would always be true -- a version of historical
determinism -- that places blame for the decline in relations on innate
qualities of the Russian state, and denies the West any responsibility
for the deterioration of its relations with Russia. If history can help
to explain Russian behavior, then surely it can also reveal the lessons
of the past. Might we learn anything from failed approaches to Russia?

Power Politics," The Geopolitics, 03-11-2025,
https://thegeopolitics.com/polar-realignment-trump-putin-and-the-future-of-arctic-power-politics/

**[Trump's obsession with the Arctic is not new, but in his second term,
it has taken a more confrontational line]{.underline}**. In a March 4
address to **[Congress, he declared: "One way or another, we're going to
get Greenland]{.underline}**." Citing national security concerns and
economic potential, **[Trump framed Greenland as an essential asset in
securing U.S. dominance in the Arctic]{.underline}**. While he paid lip
service to Greenlandic self-determination, **[his rhetoric sparked an
outcry from Greenland's leadership, who fiercely rejected any suggestion
of annexation.]{.underline}**

**[The controversy over Greenland shows a broader shift in Trump's
Arctic strategy]{.underline}**: **[the move away from cooperative
multilateralism toward unilateral strategic acquisition]{.underline}**.
This is to be seen in the context of Trump's historical discomfort with
NATO and his growing readiness to sidestep European allies in favour of
direct bilateral deals. **[Greenland's rejection of Trump's comments has
sparked debates about sovereignty, resource nationalism, and the role of
smaller Arctic actors in shaping their destinies.]{.underline}**

### Thumpers\-\--1AR

#### The Greenland threats have freaked Russia out.

**Devyatkin 25** -- Senior Associate at the Arctic Institute, Lecturer
and PhD Fellow at the Higher School of Economics,

Pavel Devyatkin, "A New Age for US-Russia Arctic Cooperation?," The
Nation, 03-18-2025,
https://www.thenation.com/article/world/russia-putin-trump-climate-diplomacy-war/

**[Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland]{.underline}**, not ruling
out military or economic coercion, **[has reignited global concerns over
Arctic stability]{.underline}**. **[Trump's threats against
Denmark]{.underline}**, a NATO ally, **[have caused alarm in
the]{.underline}** Euro-Atlantic **[community]{.underline}**. While some
Russian state media pundits celebrated Trump's statements, **[Russian
diplomats criticized the destabilizing effect]{.underline}** of the
proposal **[and said that Trump's plan "can only bring uncertainty and
tension to the region]{.underline}**."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

**[Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the
place" near Greenland, indicating an element of great power
competition]{.underline}** in Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a
misunderstanding of Arctic security, as Russian and Chinese military
activity is far from Greenland, occasionally operating together in the
Bering Strait near Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North
American defense as a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across
the North Pole.

#### The Ukraine war thumps. It crushed Arctic cooperation.

**[Putin's decision to send troops into Ukraine]{.underline}** on 24
February 2022, during Russia's Arctic Council Chairmanship (2021--2023),
**[marked a watershed moment]{.underline}** **[in both Arctic and global
politics]{.underline}**. In response, **[the work of the Arctic Council
was paused after seven Arctic States condemned Russia's
actions]{.underline}**. **[The Council's Working and Expert Groups
were]{.underline}** **[halted]{.underline}**, **[and the White House
imposed restrictions on bilateral science and technology research
cooperation with the Russian government.]{.underline}**

**[Russia's Arctic officials described the pause in Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}** **[as 'regrettable' and]{.underline}**
declared the importance of preserving activities 'so that, when
circumstances allow, cooperation can resume without prejudice to those
who depend on these projects'.37 **[The pause of institutionalized
Arctic cooperation was initiated by the Western Arctic States and
organizations]{.underline}**, who, however, attributed the disruption to
Russia's military actions in Ukraine.

In October 2022, the Biden administration approved the National Strategy
for the Arctic Region, updating the 2013 version. Russia is mentioned 21
times, with the document noting that '**[Russia's unprovoked war of
aggression against Ukraine \[rendered\] government-to-government
cooperation with Russia in the Arctic virtually
impossible']{.underline}**.38 The Implementation Plan for the National
Strategy, also published in October 2022, reiterates this stance,
stating that '**[Russia's brutal war in Ukraine has made cooperation
with Russia virtually impossible at present']{.underline}**. The
document further highlights the '**[risks of further militarization or
unintended conflict]{.underline}**, including those resulting from
geopolitical tensions with Russia'.39 In 2024, the Department of Defense
updated its Arctic Strategy, with 36 mentions of Russia. Though Russian
activities are discussed second in the section on the Arctic strategic
environment, Russian military actions, destabilization efforts, and
Russia's collaboration with China are identified as key areas of
concern.40

In 2023, Russia updated its Arctic State Policy, Arctic Strategy, and
Foreign Policy Concept, with significant implications for Arctic
cooperation. In February 2023, **[Putin approved amendments to the
Foundations of Russia's Arctic State Policy for the
Period]{.underline}** up to 2035 and the Strategy for the Development of
the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and Provision of National
Security for the Period up to 2035.

While the 2020 Arctic State Policy included the goal of 'strengthening
good-will bilateral relations with the Arctic States as well as regional
cooperation fora, including the Arctic Council, the Arctic Five, and the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council', **[the 2023 amendments removed references
to 'strengthening good-will relations', 'Arctic States', and the
multilateral cooperation fora]{.underline}**. Although the document
still stresses the pre-eminence of the Arctic Council as the key
platform for regional cooperation, **[the update emphasized Arctic
cooperation on a bilateral basis with 'foreign States' rather than
specifically with Arctic States]{.underline}**. This shift suggests that
**[Russia is increasingly focused on]{.underline}** **[engaging with
non-Arctic States]{.underline}**, **[such as China]{.underline}**,
**[rather than the Western]{.underline}** Arctic
**[States]{.underline}** within the Arctic Council.4

The new 2023 Foreign Policy Concept of Russia highlights the Arctic as
one of the top regional priorities, whereas previously it was discussed
within the context of Western policy. As with the 2023 Arctic State
Policy, **[the 2023 Foreign Policy Concept]{.underline}** advocates for
mutually beneficial cooperation **[but places greater emphasis on
collaboration with non-Arctic States]{.underline}**. Notably, the
Concept does not mention working with Arctic States or regional
institutions in its section on the Arctic.

The Arctic section of the Concept declares that **[Russia is focused on
'counteracting the policy of unfriendly States]{.underline}** aimed at
militarizing the region and limiting Russia's ability to exercise its
sovereign rights in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation'.42
Russia's political leadership has not abandoned international
cooperation, but it has adjusted its approach in response to the
evolving global context.

#### The U.S. has taken a bunch of aggressive actions in the Arctic that exclude Russia.

**[Arctic security]{.underline}**, beyond Alaska and NORAD, **[is no
longer a blind spot for the United States]{.underline}**. In military
security affairs, **[the DoD 2024 strategy will allow for the
implementation and resourcing of the security pillar of the
NSAR.]{.underline}** Understanding is growing that wider Arctic security
directly impacts homeland defense, not least in the face of increased
Russian and Chinese competition.59

The US must avoid being a bystanderin the wider Arctic and rather focus
on having a global perspective regarding presence and access to the
region. This would entail better connections and communication ---
especially around strategic exercises and readiness. **[The 2024 DoD
strategy clearly outlines that NORTHCOM is and will remain the key
Arctic capability advocat]{.underline}**e.60 as part of the Unified
Command Plan and Total Force.

To that end, bilaterally, **[the US expanded its
agreement]{.underline}** (DCA) **[with Norway]{.underline}** **[and
entered into DCAs with Finland and Sweden]{.underline}** in 2024.61
These agreements are critical for partnership including access to basing
for US military personnel and pre-positioning of military materiel.
**[These three DCAs will allow for more than 40 locations with US
military access, including 15 in the north of each of these
countries]{.underline}**.62 They solidify critical capacity and
capability as the region and alliance continue to strengthen their
presence, deterrence, and defense.

**[Further coordination with EUCOM]{.underline}** (North Atlantic AoR)
**[and INDOPACOM]{.underline}** (military assets and troops in Alaska)
**[will also be necessary to prevent further overlap in responsibilities
and deployments]{.underline}**. Another coordination aspect is between
the US 2nd and 6th Fleets with EUCOM and NATO's JFC Norfolk.36

Moving forward, US stakeholders must identify key priorities for
capabilities and procurement of Arctic-enabled systems. Despite budget
constraints, the US government can better calibrate efforts internally
as well as with NATO allies and beyond. An important first step is to
match capabilities with operational design for cold weather operations
and future presence.

**[Since 2020, successive strategic documents released by the US armed
services have]{.underline}** helped **[identify]{.underline}**
capabilities **[gaps that have been streamlined under the 2022 NSAR and
the 2024 DoD Arctic strategy]{.underline}**.63 **[To fill the
"icebreaker gap," a major part of procurement is the extension of the
Polar Security Cutter program]{.underline}** for the US Coast Guard64
and the upcoming Arctic Security Cutter program.

In the context of the US Army's 2021 "Regaining Arctic Dominance"
strategy,65 **[the reactivation of the 11th Airborne
Division]{.underline}** in 202266 **[is a]{.underline}** positive
**[step]{.underline}** to tune US forces into Arctic operations. The
goal is to turn the Alaskan division into an Arctic-capable force by
design that can be rapidly deployed across the circumpolar theater and
beyond --- including expeditionary multidomain operations in the
Indo-Pacific theater.

**[Decisions to reactivate the Navy 2nd Fleet as part of NATO's JFC
Norfolk]{.underline}**,67 **[increase airlift capabilities at the
Keflavík airfield]{.underline}** in Iceland,68 **[and expand F-35
presence at the Eielson air base in Alaska69 are also positive
steps]{.underline}** forward in fulfilling US regional strategy.

Through permanent and rotational deployments, **[the US approach to
Arctic "calibrated presence"70 is considering a form of "agile basing"
through modular forward operating presence]{.underline}**. One issue
remains, however, in terms of division of labor, notably with Canada.
For instance, if US troops in Alaska under INDOPACOM are drawn out to
the Asia-Pacific theater, this will automatically increase pressure on
Canada to have a greater regional security role to defend North American
approaches.

Finally, as part of the "monitor and respond" approach, **[the 2024 DoD
Arctic strategy and the 2022 NSAR emphasize the need to exercise
presence in the Arctic independently and alongside
allies]{.underline}**. Presence will be further established through
continued cycles of training and drills in the US and within a NATO
context.50 US Arctic operations will focus specifically on circumpolar
security choke points such as the Bering Strait and the
Greenland--Iceland--United Kingdom (GIUK) and Greenland-Iceland-Norway
(GIN) gaps.

Regional **[Cooperation Has Proven Resilient]{.underline}** So Far

**[In spite of its military buildup and mixed rhetoric, Russia has
maintained a cooperative stance overall]{.underline}** **[with other
Arctic states]{.underline}** over the years. **[There are numerous
examples of cooperation among Arctic nations]{.underline}** in the form
of political and economic bodies, treaties and agreements, and exercises
(See Table 2.1). **[The sheer diversity of these forums and
events]{.underline}**---from SAR operations to science and the
environment---**[shows the number of areas in which Russia has found it
beneficial to work with other Arctic nations]{.underline}**. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia thus
cooperate in a number of activities]{.underline}** **[and agreements
that have provided a foundation for generally peaceful bilateral and
multilateral relationships on Arctic affairs]{.underline}**. **[The
presence of such diverse structures for collaboration creates a kind of
diplomatic safety net in the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[which may serve
to deter or quell the potential for conflict]{.underline}**. **[Should
tensions arise, these collaborative structures may even provide outlets
to voice discontent]{.underline}** **[without resorting to overtly
aggressive means]{.underline}**.

**[Consensus among Arctic nations]{.underline}** **[has been found even
on issues that were initially divisive]{.underline}**, **[such as the
decision on whether to grant observer status to non-Arctic
nations.]{.underline}**57 **[Arctic cooperation has also been maintained
through difficult times]{.underline}**, **[including the Ukraine
crisis]{.underline}** **[that began in 2014]{.underline}**. **[Russia
has continued to participate in the work of the Arctic
Council]{.underline}**, which successfully established in October 2015
an Arctic Coast Guard Forum that will provide all Arctic states,
including Russia, with the ability to take part in joint exercises and
operations in such areas as SAR and emergency preparedness. **[Arctic
states have also largely maintained their bilateral cooperation with
Russia, at least on nonmilitary matters]{.underline}**. In March 2015,
Norway and Russia carried out their annual "Barents 2015" joint exercise
simulating SAR to a vessel in distress and response to an oil spill.58
The United States still works with Russia on such issues as limitation
of black carbon emissions.59

**[The ability to maintain cooperation in the Arctic in spite of a tense
international environment dates back to the Cold War]{.underline}**.
**[Cooperation even succeeded in areas that would appear to be zero-sum
games, such as exploitation of resources. One particularly remarkable
example was the ability of Norway and the Soviet Union to successfully
operate a fisheries management framework in the Barents Sea in spite of
Cold War tensions]{.underline}** and an (at the time) unresolved
territorial dispute. **[The United States and the Soviet Union discussed
and signed the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar
Bears]{.underline}** in 1973, and Mikhail Gorbachev launched the
"Murmansk Initiatives" in 1987 to increase Arctic cooperation on a range
of issues from arms control to the environment.60 The Georgia crisis in
2008 does not appear to have adversely affected cooperation between
Russia and other Arctic states.61

**[Cooperation between Russia and its Arctic neighbors]{.underline}**,
from the Cold War through the development of the Ukraine crisis, **[has
been made possible through a number of factors]{.underline}**. **[Issues
affecting the Arctic]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** for many
years **[been distanced from global politics]{.underline}** **[because
it is a remote, ice-covered region with limited short-term prospects for
economic ga]{.underline}**in (although the Soviet Union did develop
parts of this region), despite having symbolic and strategic military
significance. Put plainly, **[cooperation has been cheaper than
conflict]{.underline}** **[in this region where so much would have to be
expended for so little gain]{.underline}**.

Arctic economic prospects will continue to draw attention, but **[a
so-called "resources war"]{.underline}** **[is unlikely]{.underline}**
**[as most resources lie within largely uncontested national boundaries
and those that don\'t have limited practical value because of difficulty
accessing and transporting]{.underline}** them to global markets.
**[Even if tensions rise in this northern region, the difficulty and
expense of operating there will serve as a deterrent to
conflict.]{.underline}**

**[Take, for example, Russia\'s attempts to control ship
traffic]{.underline}** through the Northern Sea Route along its northern
shore. With only seasonal accessibility and lacking in infrastructure,
this route cannot rival those farther south, either for strategic or
economic purposes. **[Other nations lack the incentive or icebreaking
capability to challenge Russia on this point, and a conflict in the icy,
vast north would be a costly and risky way to assert discontent merely
on principle.]{.underline}**

More concerning for Arctic stability may be Russia\'s reaction to any
perceived increase in NATO presence in the region. Five Arctic countries
(United States, Canada, Denmark by way of Greenland, Iceland and Norway)
are alliance members, and Sweden and Finland have increased their
cooperation with NATO since the Ukraine crisis began. In addition,
seasonal melting of protective ice along Russia\'s northern approach is
leaving a long coastline more exposed. This combination of geostrategic
and environmental factors could fuel fear in Moscow of encirclement from
the north.

While **[NATO]{.underline}**\'s occasional presence in the region is not
new --- it **[has long conducted exercises in Arctic-type
environments]{.underline}**, such as Cold Response in late winter 2016
--- Russia has reacted strongly to the suggestion that Sweden and
Finland may eventually join the alliance, warning both neutral nations
that joining NATO would have catastrophic consequences.

Yet the official neutrality of Sweden and Finland may be holding Russian
angst in check, even if their neutrality remains subject to much debate
in these countries**[. It is also unclear whether NATO intends to
increase its involvement in the region. The]{.underline}** **[Arctic was
not mentioned explicitly in the alliance\'s July Warsaw Summit
declaration]{.underline}** and, in the absence of a clear and immediate
threat, does not appear to be one of its priorities.

Without conspicuous trigger points, **[the Arctic has the potential to
remain resistant, if not immune, to tensions building elsewhere in the
Northern Hemisphere.]{.underline}**

**[Russia still has incentives to cooperate]{.underline}** **[with the
United States and others in the far north, or is at least deterred by
the cost of conflict in this region where its stakes are not truly being
contested]{.underline}**. For **[the United States, having some common
ground for dialogue with Russia is valuable for confidence building,
even if that ground is --- literally speaking --- mostly
ice.]{.underline}**

**[It can be difficult to see past Russia's rhetoric, deliberately
provocative acts, and grandiose statements about its Arctic plans and
threats to them, and to acknowledge that its bark so far has been worse
than its bite. Russia's ambitions far exceed the resources it has to
realize them]{.underline}**. Thus, while it is essential not to yield to
Russia's posturing, **[it is]{.underline}** equally **[important not to
overreact]{.underline}** to it.

Notwithstanding the seeming novelty of the situation---changing climate,
NATO's new frontier in Eastern Europe, China's growing footprint in the
Arctic, and so on---**[Russia's drive to the Far North and the rationale
behind it are part of a long-standing historical pattern. Its
confrontation with the West is not a new development
either]{.underline}**, and the push for Arctic resources is crucial for
its ability to sustain this posture. From the perspective of the
country's security establishment, **[Russia is playing defense rather
than offense.]{.underline}**

Moreover, **[Russia is confronting the West in vastly diminished
circumstances. Its economy is stagnant]{.underline}**, **[its population
is declining]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[it is
diplomatically isolated in Europe and among the Arctic
states]{.underline}**---almost entirely thanks to its own actions. It
has rebuilt its military capabilities after a long period of neglect and
decline, but even this utmost national priority is facing budget
constraints and technological challenges. In the years to come Russia's
Arctic pursuits and posture will likely be driven by concerns about
being able to sustain its already weakened position vis-à-vis the West.

#### The plan won't affect Arctic relations \-\-- it's tiny, AND Arctic countries overcome any disagreements.

**[Historically]{.underline}**, **[Arctic affairs have weathered
diplomatic storms]{.underline}**, **[remaining a bright
spot]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** bilateral **[relations between
the United States and Russia]{.underline}**. But the continued erosion
of relations between the two nations in recent weeks and years has the
potential to spill into the Arctic, a region usually removed from
diplomatic turmoil.

Yet **[the Arctic Circle Assembly]{.underline}** that took place over
the weekend **[managed to keep the focus squarely on ways in which
cooperation between Russia and its Arctic neighbors benefits this
northern region]{.underline}**. Some participants in the annual event
held up the unusually transparent dialogue as an example of how
**[nations can work together]{.underline}** **[despite having
adversarial relationships on other fronts]{.underline}**. And **[there
has been no shortage of them]{.underline}** --- **[Russia\'s illegal
annexation and continued destabilization of Ukraine]{.underline}**,
**[the suspension of negotiations]{.underline}** between the United
States and Russia **[over]{.underline}** a cease-fire in
**[Syria]{.underline}**, and **[Russia\'s recent announcement that it
would withdraw from a landmark arms control agreement]{.underline}**
regarding the disposal of plutonium.

**[Over the last several decades, the United States and
Russia]{.underline}** (often in partnership with their Arctic neighbors)
**[have often found common ground on Arctic affairs]{.underline}**, at
least in such areas as search and rescue and environmental integrity
that require generally consensual agreement. Defense has not been
included in Arctic cooperation so far, although search and rescue do
involve certain parts of the military, and the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable briefly brought together defense organizations from all
Arctic nations until the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.

Although **[there is no doubt that the Arctic contains vast economic
potential for Russia]{.underline}** and others, **[there are some
important reasons why this factor, on its own, is unlikely to diminish
Russia's cooperation with its Arctic neighbors]{.underline}**. Potential
for high global energy prices, along with the **[development of the
necessary infrastructure]{.underline}** and access to extraction
technologies, **[will be instrumental in determining the magnitude of
impact from this factor]{.underline}**. In addition, **[Russia's natural
gas, oil, minerals, fish stocks, and other resources are not under any
major threat, real or perceived]{.underline}**, **[from inside or
outside the Arctic]{.underline}**. Other than the upcoming CLCS decision
we will discuss next, **[there are no major territorial disputes between
Russia and its Arctic neighbors in which there might be substantial
resources at stake.]{.underline}** **[Even if Russia is not successful
in its bid for certain contested areas]{.underline}** of the Arctic
Ocean seabed, **[it has other hydrocarbon resources within its EEZ that
can be developed]{.underline}**. For example, only about 20 percent of
the Barents Sea and 15 percent of the Kara Sea have been explored; the
East Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, and the portion of the Chukchi Sea off
the Russian coast have not been explored at all.32 In the Barents and
Kara seas, approximately 430 million tons of oil and 8.5 trillion cubic
meters of natural gas have been discovered on the Russian continental
shelf but are yet to be developed.33

It could be argued that tensions around resources may come from
non-Arctic nations. China, in particular, has shown an interest in
Arctic resources. However, Russia has carefully made China a partner,
not an adversary, in Arctic resource extraction. For example, the
countries are collaborating in efforts to extract natural gas from the
Yamal Peninsula. Further, Russia and China appear poised to collaborate,
rather than compete, when it comes to mining because it could give them
a strategic advantage in controlling rare-earth metals that the United
States and other developed countries desperately need for a large number
of industries.34 The Arctic Coastal states, including Russia, have also
involved China in discussions about prohibiting commercial fishing in
the Arctic high seas, clearly acknowledging its Arctic interests and
attempting to secure its compliance with the regulation in so doing.

**[Destabilizing the region could also limit Russia's potential to
benefit from its Arctic resources]{.underline}**, **[which its national
priorities clearly indicate it wishes to do]{.underline}**. **[The
difficulty of resource exploration and exploitation in this harsh,
remote region hugely complicates the road to
profitability]{.underline}**,35 let **[alone if a conflict were to put
at risk personnel, ships, infrastructure, and sea lanes needed to
support these activities and bring resources to global
markets]{.underline}**. Further, **[Russia has long been dependent on
western technology for oil and gas exploitation]{.underline}**. If
sanctions remain in place and western companies advance offshore
drilling technology, Russia's access to these innovations may be delayed
or prevented altogether, limiting the nation's ability to economically
exploit some of its offshore energy reserves.36

Since returning to the White House, Donald **[Trump has overseen a rapid
thaw in relations with Moscow]{.underline}**. Among **[the more curious
points of alignment: a renewed focus on the Arctic]{.underline}**.
Despite Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine --- the very conflict that
fractured U.S.--Russia ties --- **[both countries have begun
speaking]{.underline}**, at least in broad strokes, **[about possible
cooperation in the world's northernmost region]{.underline}**. Proposals
range from sharing sea lanes to joint energy development projects. But
with sanctions still in place and trust in short supply, **[scientific
research now appears to be the easiest]{.underline}**, **[least
politically fraught]{.underline}** **[arena for renewed
engagement]{.underline}**. Even there, though, the two sides may be
further apart than they seem. To understand how climate science,
geopolitics, and Arctic ambitions collide, Meduza spoke with two leading
experts: Arild Moe of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute and Ilia Shumanov,
director of the Arctida project.

### \--No Climate Change Link\-\--1AR

**[With joint business ventures still difficult to

**[The Arctic Council]{.underline}** --- an intergovernmental forum
**[focused on]{.underline}** scientific and **[environmental

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but also Finland and Sweden's
accession to NATO]{.underline}**, which left Russia the lone non-NATO
country in the Arctic Circle. "It was almost on its deathbed," Moe said,
"but **[it seems that all parties wanted it to remain]{.underline}**."

Although research and scientific cooperation in the Arctic encompass
many disciplines and fields, **[climate change research is seen as a key
priority]{.underline}**, **[since the region has been warming nearly
four times faster]{.underline}** than the rest of the world.5) The
effects of climate change are being felt around the world and are
manifesting themselves in various ways such as sea level rise, changes
in climate and precipitation patterns, increases in severe weather
events, an alarming increase in forest fires and loss of biodiversity.

**[The suspension of Arctic scientific cooperation]{.underline}**
**[with Russia poses a challenge in this regard, since climate change
does not simply put itself on hold because of geopolitical
developments]{.underline}**. **[Canceling]{.underline}** ongoing and
future **[research projects creates knowledge gaps and impedes efforts
to mitigate climate change]{.underline}**. However, the Arctic research
community is not an apolitical bubble: science impacts politics and
politics impact science. Research is often funded by governments that
favor certain research agendas.

Russia's attack on a sovereign country violated international law and
brought war to Europe. These actions could not be ignored and required a
response. Nonetheless, **[halting scientific cooperation]{.underline}**
with Russia **[impacts many research projects and is detrimental to
long-term measurement programs that monitor the different facets of
climate change]{.underline}**. **[The Russian Arctic remains important
in addressing global environmental problems]{.underline}** such as
thawing permafrost and preventing wildfires since Russia accounts for
over half of the Arctic's coastline.6) However, given Russia's limited
efforts to tackle climate change in the past7) and its failure to
genuinely engage in climate cooperation and transparently implement
climate policies,8) its role should not be overestimated.

### Cooperation Inevitable\-\--2AC

#### Cooperation is inevitable, even if there are disagreements. It ebbs and flows.

Since the end of the Cold War, **[strategic priorities regarding Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}** between the United States and Russia **[have
fluctuated]{.underline}**. **[Bilateral and multilateral commitments
between the two nations in the Arctic have experienced both positive and
negative phases]{.underline}**, **[reflected in the official strategic
documents]{.underline}** published by each State and endorsed by their
respective presidents. This analysis is structured according to
presidential administrations, beginning with US President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Clinton was the first post-Cold War
US President to develop an Arctic strategy, while Yeltsin was the first
President of the Russian Federation. The Essay identifies **[shifts in
Arctic strategies across successive US and Russian
administrations]{.underline}**, contextualized within broader US-Russia
relations and global military interventions, particularly following the
conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine.

This Essay contributes to the study of Arctic strategy in relation to
international cooperation. Strategic studies typically examine the
relationship between means and ends, often within the context of
conflict. However, as T.V. Paul asserts, 'strategy is not all about war
or narrow national security', but also encompasses 'managing the
continuation, termination, and absence of war'.1 In this framework,
**[the strategic priorities underlying US-Russia Arctic cooperation can
be linked to the peaceful preservation of regional security and
stability]{.underline}**. Furthermore, cooperation can be interpreted as
a response to actual or potential conflict, and thus constitutes a
security concern, as it arises when actors perceive their policies to be
in conflict.

**[Russia]{.underline}** also **[benefits from stability in the
Arctic]{.underline}** **[because it helps enable the economic
development and investment it aspires to bring to the
region]{.underline}**. **[The difficulty of extracting resources
requires large and long-term investments, as well as public-private
partnerships]{.underline}** to bring the appropriate technology to the
areas to be exploited.65 **[This last point is of particular importance

the "use of Russia's Arctic zone as a strategic **[resource base of the
Russian Federation]{.underline}**" to **[spur socioeconomic
development]{.underline}**, one of Russia's main national interests.66
**[Without cooperation]{.underline}** and a generally peaceful

and the scarcity of ports is an added danger.

Likewise, the journey for American companies into Russian commercial
space can be risky from a regulatory standpoint.

**[The legal terms of any joint U.S.-Russia enterprises are
murky]{.underline}**. Moscow has a list of "unfriendly countries" that
essentially act as a tool of reciprocal sanctions. **[Putin would have
to exclude the United States from the list.]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**, **[scorched by the quick exodus of Western
companies]{.underline}** in the first weeks of the Ukraine war,
**[signaled that any companies allowed back in would face new
regulations and strictures to keep such an exit from happening
again.]{.underline}**

"Now we will demand investments not just in papers but in the land," a
senior Kremlin official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss
the matter more freely. "We will demand a situation that will prevent
them further from taking a decision and leaving everything overnight."

Before the war in Ukraine, a handful of foreign companies were involved
in Russia's Arctic energy sector, though sanctions and geopolitical
tensions often restricted their footprint.

The Shtokman gas field was once planned as a major LNG export hub, led
by Gazprom, French Total and Norwegian Equinor. The project stalled
because of high costs and technological challenges. Western sanctions
after the 2014 Crimea annexation further doomed it, and it was
officially shelved.

ExxonMobil was the most significant U.S. player, teaming up with Rosneft
in such major projects as the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas development.

Other American firms, including Halliburton, SLB, and Baker Hughes,
played supporting roles, providing technology, equipment and oil field
services to Russian energy giants.

**[After rounds of sanctions, American energy firms had little choice
but to pack up and sever ties]{.underline}** with one of the world's
most resource-rich but politically volatile nations.

**[This legacy now raises questions about whether the Trump-Putin
rapprochement would be enough to persuade U.S. companies]{.underline}**
**[to risk operating in the market with high interest rates, increasing
inflation and a rule of law that often exists only in
theory.]{.underline}**

### No Spillover\-\--1AR

#### Russia will double down outside of the Arctic. Cooperation doesn't solve.

\*AC = Arctic Council

**[Instead of cooperation with the West]{.underline}**, **[Russia is
increasingly looking to the East]{.underline}** **[and doubling down on
collaboration with the U.S.' strategic competitors such as
China]{.underline}**. **[This trend is one of the main consequences of
pausing the work of the AC]{.underline}** **[and discontinuing
cooperation with Russia]{.underline}**. Korchunov has proclaimed that
"**[it is difficult to imagine]{.underline}** Arctic cooperation without
the participation of Russia \[and **[that]{.underline}**\] **[Russia
remains open to cooperation]{.underline}**, including with non-Arctic
states."5)

**[Russia's welcoming of Eastern partners]{.underline}** to the Arctic
**[is part of a larger global trend]{.underline}** that has been going
on for years, but it has been especially noticeable since February as
Russia's diplomats engage with the states of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East, Turkey,
India, Africa and others. In the Arctic, Russia is welcoming Chinese,
Indian, and Middle Eastern companies to invest in projects previously
involving Western firms. For example, after Western companies withdrew
from the Russian Arctic due to sanctions, Russia's Novatek is now
looking to the Emirati firm Green Energy Solutions to receive important
technology to construct liquefied natural gas projects and to the
Turkish company Karpowership for a floating power plant.6)

**[There are increasing signs of Russia-China strategic cooperation in
the Arctic]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. Coast Guard unexpectedly
encountered Chinese and Russian warships operating together close to
Alaska]{.underline}** in September 2022.7) A month later at the Arctic
Circle Assembly, China's Special Arctic Envoy, Feng Gao, said that China
would not support Norway's AC chairmanship if Russia was excluded. Feng
Gao criticized the interruption of international cooperation due to
geopolitical competition and confrontation.8)

**[The Snowflake international science stations]{.underline}** in the
Russian Arctic, which were expected to launch at the end of 2024 and
become a hub for international research, now **[seem to be developing
into another Russia-China collaboration]{.underline}**.9) The
cancellation of U.S.-China climate change talks in the wake of Nancy
Pelosi's Taiwan visit may also speed up the process of Russia-China
cooperation in climate and environmental research in the Arctic.

**[Russia's actions in the Arctic]{.underline}**---**[its aggressive
rhetoric]{.underline}** **[and its far-reaching territorial
claims]{.underline}**---**[have done little to improve its diplomatic
position there vis-à-vis other Arctic states and only antagonized

claim rejected by the United States and likely viewed with suspicion by
other Arctic nations.

**[Considering the long-term nature of Russia's confrontation with the
West, the return to the relatively benign geopolitical environment in
the Arctic that existed there in the 1990s is unlikely]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[the current situation is not due to a misunderstanding, but
rather to a clash of the two parties' interests]{.underline}**. That
leaves two broad avenues for managing the standoff:

### Broader Diplomacy Doomed\-\--2AC

#### U.S.-Russia diplomacy is doomed. Decades of mistrust won't be surmounted.

Strategist, 03-12-2025,

**[The Trump administration's effort to divide Russia from China is
doomed to fail]{.underline}**. **[This means that the United States is
destroying security relationships based on a delusion.]{.underline}**

**[To succeed, Russia would need to overcome more than a century of
hostility and distrust]{.underline}**. **[Both Russia and the US would
have to reorient their relationships with allies and
adversaries]{.underline}**; a**[nd the US would need to replace China's
economic support to Russia]{.underline}**. **[Russia
would]{.underline}** also **[have to be sure that the US would fully
abandon its commitment to democracy and human rights]{.underline}** for
the long term. **[None of this will happen.]{.underline}**

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said at the
Munich Security Conference on 15 February that the US would try to break
Putin's alliances, including those with China, Iran and North Korea.

Just nine days later Vladimir **[Putin and Xi]{.underline}** Jinping
explicitly **[reaffirmed their 'no-limits partnership']{.underline}**.
That should have come as no surprise: the new **[US policy does nothing
to change]{.underline}** the reasons underlying **[Moscow's political
alignment]{.underline}** with Beijing.

These **[reasons include]{.underline}**: a **[shared commitment to
autocracy]{.underline}** **[and opposition to democracy]{.underline}**;
**[more than a century of distrust and conflict with the
US]{.underline}**; **[historical commitments to partners]{.underline}**
**[such as North Korea, Iran and Cuba; and Russia's economic dependence
on China]{.underline}**.

Most significantly, **[the bond between Russia and China is firmly
rooted in a shared fear of the US and a mutual commitment to
autocracy]{.underline}**. Putin will never trade China for the US as
long as the latter remains a law-governed, multi-party democracy. **[One
could argue that the Trump administration's authoritarian tendencies
change this calculation, but for Putin, Xi's dedication to despotism is
a much safer bet]{.underline}** than a full and long-term collapse of US
democracy.

Similarly, **[Putin cannot safely trust that the US's new pro-Russia
turn will endure]{.underline}**. This administration appears inclined to
set aside Russia's campaigns of assassination, espionage, cyber-attacks,
economic sabotage, nuclear sabre rattling, hostage taking and
information operations against the US. But this new **[pro-Russia policy
is not guaranteed to continue under future administrations or even
survive this one's full term.]{.underline}**

On the other side, **[few Russians have a positive view of the
US]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[Russians' antipathy to the US is
entrenched and persistent]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[except for a brief
honeymoon in the 1990s, US-Russian (and US-Soviet) relations have been
characterised almost entirely by suspicion, tension and
conflict]{.underline}**, **[even including when they were (reluctant)
allies during two world wars.]{.underline}**

**[Conflicts across the globe continue to fester]{.underline}**,
**[undermining stability in critical regions]{.underline}**. **[The
window for diplomacy appears to be narrowing]{.underline}**, **[and the
U.S., despite earnest efforts, is running out of time.]{.underline}**

**[Repeated appeals for peace]{.underline}**, however persistent,
**[have not been sufficient to break through the entrenched complexities
of current crises]{.underline}**. What was once touted as a "90 percent
done" deal in Gaza now seems a distant reality. Just two weeks ago, a
U.S.-backed proposal for a 21-day cease-fire, designed to facilitate
diplomatic engagement between Israel and Hezbollah along the Blue Line,
failed to gain traction and was followed by significant escalation.
Mediation efforts in Sudan aiming to broker a cease-fire are under siege
as the Sudanese Armed Forces, one of the belligerent parties in the
brutal civil war, launches a new offensive.

Successful diplomacy requires a balance of incentives and consequences.
Offering rewards without accountability---the proverbial carrot without
the stick---rarely shifts the dial. It's not that the world lacks an
appetite for diplomacy or mediation. China's successful brokering of a
rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a case in point.
Meaningful negotiations were possible at COP28, where difficult
concessions ultimately led to consensus. A groundbreaking new treaty on
intellectual property, genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge was also adopted by consensus by the World Intellectual
Property Organization membership. Even more recently, Iranian officials
have indicated a willingness to engage in talks with the U.S.

Yet, **[despite]{.underline}** these **[efforts]{.underline}**,
**[Western diplomacy has too often missed critical
opportunities]{.underline}**. **[Diplomatic breakthroughs have become
increasingly rare]{.underline}**, **[with few exceptions]{.underline}**.
The United Arab Emirates' facilitation of prisoner exchanges between
Russia and Ukraine stands out as a success. Turkey and Armenia have made
good progress at normalizing ties after a two-year lull.C

But let's be honest: **[the Trump-Putin call was never going to produce
a diplomatic breakthrough]{.underline}**. **[Given the respective
positions of Ukraine and Russia, to expect otherwise would be naive at
best and idiotic in the extreme]{.underline}**. **[Trump]{.underline}**,
for all his bold words about getting Putin and Zelensky into a room to
work something out, **[has appeared increasingly
frustrated]{.underline}** at the failures of his efforts. **[Trump isn't
a details-oriented man]{.underline}**; he wanted a big result,
yesterday. But he also has his pride. He wasn't about to admit that the
**[peace talks are going nowhere]{.underline}** very fast.

Some observers were hoping that Trump would read Putin the riot act:
show some goodwill and sign onto an unconditional, 30-day ceasefire or
face the full power of US financial sanctions and ruin your chance of a
rapprochement from Washington. Again, that was never likely. **[Trump
has proven hesitant to do anything to Putin that could rock the
diplomatic boat.]{.underline}**

Sure, splashing more sanctions on the Russian economy might frighten the
Kremlin enough into agreeing to the short-term truce it spurned just a
few days ago. Yet such a turn on Trump's part might also push Putin into
being even more uncooperative. Trump still wants a peace deal, and
whether you like it or not, **[Putin has a veto over the entire
process.]{.underline}**

## Impact

### No Diplomacy Impact\-\--2AC

#### No diplomacy impact. Actors will exercise restraint.

Mary Chesnut, "US/NATO-Russian Strategic Stability and the War in
Ukraine," Center for Naval Analyses, 06-xx-2023,
https://www.cna.org/reports/2023/06/US-NATO-Russian-Strategic-Stability-in-Ukraine.pdf

**[This paper analyzes]{.underline}** the role of nuclear weapons in
**[Russia's war in Ukraine]{.underline}** **[as well as]{.underline}**
the war's impact on **[overall US/North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO)--Russian strategic stability]{.underline}**. Strategic stability
refers to the existence of two conditions: (1) crisis stability, where
**[there is no incentive for either country to conduct a first nuclear
strike]{.underline}**, and (2) arms race stability, where there is no
incentive for either country to augment its nuclear arsenal to gain
significant advantages over the other's.1 **[The paper uses open-source
data to analyze the immediate and longer-terms impacts of the
Russo-Ukrainian war on both crisis stability and on arms race
stability]{.underline}**. Because many of the potential nuclear
escalation pathways involve escalation from the use of conventional
(non-nuclear) weapons, this paper also necessarily explores the
interactions between conventional war and potential nuclear use.

This paper begins by applying an existing framework for understanding
escalation to examine US/NATO-Russian strategic stability in the
Russo-Ukrainian war. After assessing real and hypothetical instances of
horizontal and vertical escalation, it appears that avoiding and
deterring horizontal escalation on both sides, at least in this
conflict, may be easier and more successful given appreciation for the
inherent risks of two nuclear weapons states fighting each other
directly. By contrast, vertical escalation may be more challenging to
deter, and red lines may be harder to gauge. This is in part due to the
fact that the effects of Western vertical escalation may compound slowly
over time. Two major additional escalation challenges arise where there
is significant ambiguity between sides: (1) What does Russia consider
"Russian homeland" or "Russian territory"?, and (2) When does Western
support become direct involvement? The inherent ambiguity in these
questions presents opportunities for deliberate risk manipulation as
well as miscalculation.

In addition, while the US has attempted to prevent the deterioration of
crisis stability from having a spillover impact on arms race stability
by de-linking the two issues, Russia has consistently stressed
throughout the conflict that it could not divorce the matter of
bilateral arms control from "geopolitical realities." As a result of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its subsequent political linkages, the
future of the New START nuclear agreement and of US-Russian nuclear arms
control is uncertain. Although this case study alone is not sufficient
in demonstrating any broader relationship between crisis stability and
arms race stability, it does highlight the fragility of even a legally
binding arms control treaty in the context of worsening peer competitor
relations, and the fact that both parties must be willing to continue
complying with and implementing the agreement for its sustained success.

Finally, there are a variety of wide-ranging near-term and long-term
impacts that flow from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Near-term impacts
include several NATO reactions to enhance security and reassure alliance
members, the stagnation of the Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD), and
Russia's suspension of and noncompliance with the New START treaty. In
the long term, the security dilemma response loop poses significant
risks for US-Russia and NATO-Russia relations, Russia may have an
increased Russian reliance on its nuclear arsenal, and the
already-complicated environment for negotiating future US-Russian
bilateral nuclear arms control agreements may become more tenuous.

Background

On February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin announced Russia's "special
military operation" in Ukraine, following more than eight years of
conflict after Moscow's annexation of Crimea and the prolonged presence
of Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
Following a buildup of well over 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border, and
repeated denials that it was planning to invade its neighbor,2 Putin
ordered the Russian invasion in order to "protect people who, for eight
years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the
Kyiv regime," adding that Russia "will seek to demilitarize and denazify
Ukraine."3 Moscow also routinely justified its invasion by falsely
claiming that Ukraine was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and that
the US and Ukraine were involved in creating biological weapons.4

In addition to Russia's protracted conflict with Ukraine, parts of the
war have involved or referenced Russia's relationship with the NATO
alliance, even though the alliance is not formally involved. In the
weeks leading up to the invasion, Moscow presented two "draft treaties"
to the US and NATO containing security demands widely viewed as
non-starters by Washington and Brussels---including to withdraw NATO
forces from Eastern Europe, forgo future NATO expansion, and "not
implement security measures that could undermine core security
interests" of Russia.5 Although the US rejected the security demands,
Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered what he called a "serious
diplomatic path" to resolving Moscow's security concerns.6 However,
Putin did not opt for this approach. In the February 24 speech in which
he announced the "special military operation," Putin said in reference
to Ukraine, The problem is that in territories adjacent to Russia, which
I have to note is our historical land, a hostile "anti-Russia" is taking
shape. Fully controlled from the outside, they are doing everything to
attract NATO armed forces and obtain cutting-edge weapons.... It is not
only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of
our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have
spoken about on numerous occasions. They have crossed it.7

Similar sentiments were highlighted in Putin's address to the Federal
Assembly three days earlier, where NATO was mentioned 41 times.8

Nuclear threats, signaling, and the fear of Russia's use of nuclear
weapons have played a significant role in the war in Ukraine since the
very beginning of the conflict, when Putin threatened that if any
external actors attempted to interfere, Russia would respond
"immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen
in your entire history."9 Such threats, as well as the overall decline
in strategic stability between Russia and the US/NATO, are examined in
greater detail in the subsequent portions of this paper.

Part I: Crisis Stability

This section of the paper explores escalation pathways and the role of
nuclear weapons in the RussoUkrainian war, as well as both the immediate
and longer-term impacts of the war on crisis stability.

Applying an escalation framework for considering US/NATORussian
stability in the Russo-Ukrainian war

In several studies examining the nature of escalation in armed conflict
that predate the war in Ukraine, the authors group escalation into a
variety of different categories, including horizontal and vertical.10
This section of the report examines a selection of real and hypothetical
escalation scenarios that run the risk of intensifying the
Russo-Ukrainian war, plausibly to the point where nuclear use is
considered, and groups them into the categories of horizontal and
vertical escalation. Although these categories are imperfect, and differ
somewhat from the referenced studies, viewing escalation through this
lens may help us better conceptualize, assess, and manage the dynamics
at play in the conflict. US/NATO and Russian threats designed to deter
horizontal and vertical escalation are discussed later in this paper.

Horizontal escalation

Horizontal escalation refers to instances that would expand the
geographical scope or number of combatants of the conflict. A 2008 RAND
report identifies horizontal escalation as including expanded locations
of targets and broadened boundaries of the conflict.11 In the context of
the Russo-Ukrainian war, several potential instances of horizontal
escalation could further escalate the conflict -- perhaps eventually
into nuclear use \-- such as Russia and US/NATO fighting each other
directly.

Potential Western-initiated actions include the following:

o The creation of a Western-enforced no-fly zone, which was proposed by
Ukraine and discussed at the beginning of the conflict.12 Although the
US has supported no-fly zones in conflicts in Iraq, Bosnia, and Libya,
the enforcement of a no-fly zone in this conflict would involve
US/NATO-country pilots and aircraft directly confronting Russian pilots
and aircraft.13

o The deployment of US or NATO forces to fight directly against Russian
forces in Ukraine. President Joe Biden stressed early and consistently
that this option was not on the table.14 Some US analysts have also
suggested striking Russian military forces and infrastructure inside
Ukraine if Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon.15

o Any direct US or NATO military actions against Russia or the Russian
exclave of Kaliningrad. o NATO expansion to include Ukraine while the
conflict is ongoing, which would similarly position Russia and NATO in
direct conflict. On September 30, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky announced a "fast-track" bid to join NATO.16

o The use of Western-supplied military aid, such as long-range
artillery, to target the Russian homeland. In an effort to prevent such
escalation before supplying High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems
(HIMARS) to Ukraine, the US had Kyiv agree to use the HIMARS only
against Russian targets within Ukraine.17 Russian officials have
continually warned of the escalation risks associated with supplying
Ukraine with longrange artillery.18

● Potential Russian-initiated actions include the following:

o Any attack or aggressive action against a NATO country that could
trigger Article 4 or Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty. Plausible
scenarios could include a Russian attack on an aid convoy inside NATO
borders en route to Ukraine.19 The potential for such accidental or
underinformed escalation20 was witnessed when errant missile fragments,
initially presumed to be Russian (though likely Ukrainian), hit
NATOmember Poland's territory in November 2022, killing two civilians.21
o An expansion of apparent Russian war aims, such as attacks on Moldova
or other neighboring countries. 22

**[Both Russian and US/NATO officials]{.underline}** **[acknowledge that
having]{.underline}** two **[nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
**[states]{.underline}** directly **[fighting each other is dangerous,
unstable, and undesirable]{.underline}**.23 **[Because of these widely
acknowledged concerns]{.underline}**, **[aspects of]{.underline}**
horizontal **[escalation]{.underline}** between US/NATO and Russia
**[may]{.underline}** actually **[be]{.underline}** more **[easily
managed]{.underline}**. For example, under a section discussing a
potential no-fly zone, NATO's webpage on Russia's war in Ukraine states
the following: **[NATO's actions are defensive]{.underline}**,
**[designed not to provoke conflict]{.underline}** but to prevent
conflict. **[The Alliance has a responsibility to ensure that this war
does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine]{.underline}**, which would
be even more devastating and dangerous. Enforcing a no-fly zone would
bring NATO forces into direct conflict with Russia. This would
significantly escalate the war and lead to more human suffering and
destruction for all countries involved.24

In addition, before supplying Ukraine with long-range artillery systems
or approving the supply of USmade F-16s, the US stipulated that neither
be used to target Russian territory.25 Such **[caution is seen in past
conflicts]{.underline}** **[involving both countries]{.underline}**,
**[resulting in US and Russian deconfliction mechanisms, the use of
hotlines and private talks, and by instances of restraint exercised by
both sides]{.underline}**. **[For example, direct conflict was
successfully averted in the Syrian war through communication and
deconfliction mechanisms]{.underline}**.26

Arguably, **[the closest instance]{.underline}** **[to direct US-Russian
conflict]{.underline}** during the Russo-Ukrainian war **[occurred March
14, 2023]{.underline}**, **[when a Russian Su-27 pilot shot down an
American MQ-9 Reaper drone]{.underline}** operating in international
airspace over the Black Sea, not far from Crimea. However, the
circumstances of the event---such as whether this was intentional
signaling sanctioned by top Russian officials, or merely the result of a
close approach gone wrong---are not fully understood.27 In either case,
**[the escalation]{.underline}** potential **[was]{.underline}**
somewhat **[limited]{.underline}**, as there were no casualties
involved. In addition, **[the US response was one of
restraint]{.underline}**; **[officials chose not to further escalate the
situation]{.underline}**.28

#### Arms racing will not escalate.

China's intervention in Korea in 1950 (with approval and support from
Moscow), India's invasion of East Pakistan in 1971 (following an
international diplomatic campaign by Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi), Egypt's attack on Israel in 1973 (targeting the desire of the
United States to exclude Soviet influence in the Middle East), and
Iraq's attack on Iran in 1980 (with Gulf Arab and U.S. approval), were
all underpinned by solid diplomatic strategies taking primacy over
concerns of relative power. In circumstances where diplomatic strategies
were poorly conceived by the war initiator, such as Argentina's 1982
amphibious landing on the Falklands, and the 2009 Georgian-Russian
conflict, decisions were not influenced by anything more than the
availability of some minimum sufficient arsenal. **[Countries do go to
war because they perceive their own]{.underline}** long-term
**[decline]{.underline}**, **[as Germany and the Ottoman
Empire]{.underline}** did vis-à-vis Russia in 1914 and 1915,
**[or]{.underline}** as **[Pakistan did]{.underline}** in 1965 against
India, **[but these decisions were also not influenced by
weapons]{.underline}**, **[as much as by the anticipated underlying
power]{.underline}** that enabled weapons manufacture.

My Chinese students in the strategic studies classes I teach often argue
that Washington is maneuvering to trick Beijing into starting a war that
will then leave it diplomatically isolated against the international
community. This is called a justification-of-war crisis. This is
commonly but falsely believed to be the strategy used by the United
States to attack Spain in 1898 (the Main Affair), Germany in 1917 (the
Zimmerman Telegram), Japan in 1941 (that President Franklin Roosevelt
anticipated the Pearl Harbor air attack), North Vietnam in 1965 (the
Gulf of Tonkin incident), Grenada in 1983 (the vulnerable medical
students), Iran in 1988 (the shooting down of an Iranian airliner), Iraq
in 1991 (Secretary of State James Baker's ultimatum to Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz), and Serbia in 1999 (the allegedly Serbian mortar
attack on a market).

**[The Reagan arms build-up of the 1980s may not have directly ended the
Cold War or liberated the Warsaw Pact countries]{.underline}** from
their puppet regimes, **[but]{.underline}** **[it kept the
confrontation]{.underline}** **[with the Soviet Union from turning
hot.]{.underline}** **[It also bought precious time for the Russians to
resolve the contradictions in their political
development]{.underline}**, **[significantly reducing the subsequent
level of hostility]{.underline}**. **[The consequences of the faltering
attempts]{.underline}** **[to deter Nazi expansionism]{.underline}**
**[are a far more vivid reminder of the costs of military
unpreparedness]{.underline}** **[than is the stylized and unsupported
assertion that World War I was caused by arms race
tensions]{.underline}**.

**[China will predictably stoke concerns]{.underline}** **[about arms
races, while avoiding any arms control constraints on their own military
build-up]{.underline}**. **[If China closes the gap]{.underline}** on,
for example, the number of ocean-going platforms, or submarines, or
total missile tubes, or achieves a sufficient concentration in sea
denial systems, such as sea mines or anti-ship ballistic missiles,
**[then Beijing will view war as an attractive option]{.underline}**.
**[The likelihood of war will be reduced dramatically, therefore, if the
United States and its democratic allies]{.underline}** **[commit to the
procurement of a sustainably robust defense]{.underline}**.
