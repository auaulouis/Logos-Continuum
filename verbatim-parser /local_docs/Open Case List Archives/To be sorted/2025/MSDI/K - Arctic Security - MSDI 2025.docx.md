#### The 1AC's [overrepresentation]{.underline} of Arctic [competition]{.underline} transforms it into a [securitized region]{.underline}.

As the Arctic's geostrategic significance increases, it matters how we
talk about it.

Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [[the Arctic is]{.mark}
becoming nearly [**synonymous** with **fears** about **Russia** and
**China**]{.mark}. Military strategists and journalists alike write
about **Russian militarization** as well as unwelcome **Chinese
influence** in the High North. While there are certainly **geopolitical
realities**]{.underline} to take into consideration when thinking about
Arctic policy, [[in focusing **too heavily** on]{.mark} questions of
"**hard**" [security, policymakers are **obscuring**]{.mark} other
**transnational [issues]{.mark}**, such as **climate change** and
**cyber security**]{.underline}, where cooperation is not only desired
but also necessary.

In other words, [[discussing]{.mark} **interstate [competition]{.mark}**
[too much]{.mark} leads [the Arctic]{.mark} on a **trajectory**
[toward]{.mark} becoming [a **securitized region**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yet, [it **doesn't have** to be this way. This trend can]{.underline}
--- [and **should**]{.underline} --- [be reversed to **mitigate**
possible **consequences**]{.underline}, such as: Focusing on how
cooperation can be used to solve key issues in the Arctic rather than
thinking solely about military buildup; changing the framing of the
Arctic in official policies, speeches, and critical international
organizations, such as the Arctic Council, and finding low-stakes issues
to encourage relationship-building among actors in the Arctic.

So, can the Arctic be spared from securitization?

EARLY SYMPTOMS OF SECURITIZATION

[[Securitization is the **process** of]{.mark} something [becoming a
**security threat**]{.mark} or a security issue]{.underline}. It happens
[when something]{.underline} --- [such as **immigration**]{.underline}
--- [is [labeled]{.mark} as dangerous, threatening, and [as]{.mark} an
**[existential]{.mark} crisis**]{.underline} by someone, [and
[then]{.mark} that framing is [**accepted** by an
**audience**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Importantly, [securitization implies
that **security issues** are not just **out there**]{.underline}.
Instead, [[by creating]{.mark} **security [threats]{.mark}** [in the way
we **speak**, we create **security issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
the Arctic might seem like a peripheral region globally, there is
evidence that it is beginning to rise in importance. [[Concerns about
**China**, **Russia**, and]{.mark} resource [**competition** are causing
**real changes**]{.mark} to occur in how states **treat the
Arctic**]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has announced the
establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be housed within
the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique challenges and
security concerns related to the Arctic region."

[As **climate change** has resulted in **new shipping lanes** and easier
**access** to **resources** in the Arctic]{.underline}, the interests of
Arctic states --- United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland,
Finland, Denmark, and Sweden --- and non-Arctic states --- China, United
Kingdom, and EU to name a few --- have grown. [The Arctic presents
**virtually untapped** amounts of oil, gas, and minerals that
**attract** both **Arctic** and **non-Arctic** states]{.underline}. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [it is **by
[no]{.mark} means** a [**necessity** to treat Chinese influence
as]{.mark} **inherently [negative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By the same
logic, [Russian **investment** and **military actions** in the Arctic
might seem **overtly negative**, but it is important to
**[contextualize]{.mark}** Russian [interest]{.mark} in the Arctic
[as]{.mark} **not recent**, but **[historic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Instead, [the **rhetoric** around these issues has treated them as
**critical security risks**]{.underline}, painting the Arctic as the
next theater of a new Cold War. But is the Arctic really the next
theater?

The most significant concern when it comes to treating the Arctic as a
theater of great power competition is the danger it presents in putting
the Arctic on a trajectory of becoming a securitized region.

Rather than focusing on these interstate threats, [there are more
**serious concerns**, such as **[climate change]{.mark}** and
insecurities]{.underline} that stem from it --- such as food, water,
environmental, and health security concerns --- [that [affect
**individuals**]{.mark} and impact their **quality of
life**]{.underline}. For example, [[Alaskan communities are
**suffering**]{.mark} from **food insecurity** because sea ice is
**melting**, causing traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise
hunt, to move elsewhere and **decreasing** their
**protection**]{.underline} from the large ocean waves that have in some
cases caused devastating infrastructure damage. On Little Diomede
Island, for example, a late storm caused serious damage to a water
treatment plant, leaving the town without clean water and without power.
[[By **over-emphasizing "hard" security**]{.mark} issues from **Russia**
and **China**]{.underline}, therefore, [the [rhetoric]{.mark}
surrounding Arctic politics **[ignores]{.mark}** other **important
questions** that impact [people on the **ground**, particularly
**Indigenous people**]{.mark}]{.underline} whose livelihoods and
societal resilience are threatened by climate change.

[The **[most significant]{.mark}** concern]{.underline} when it comes to
treating the Arctic as a theater of great power competition [[is]{.mark}
the **danger** it presents in putting [the **Arctic**]{.mark} on a
trajectory of [becoming]{.mark} a **[securitized]{.mark} region**. While
it can be argued that]{.underline} as it stands, [the Arctic is not [a
**contested region**]{.mark} or a region [**fraught** with
**wars**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and parts of
Africa, [it [could be]{.mark} if [the **trajectory**]{.mark} of treating
the Arctic as this region of **competition** and security **continues**.
[Regions]{.mark} of the world]{.underline} do not [[become theaters of
**competition**]{.underline}]{.mark} and conflict overnight, but instead
become that way [[after years of **construction**]{.mark} that involves
a range of activities]{.underline} from rhetoric and to military
buildups. Crimea is a telling example of this, where both Ukraine and
Russia slowly began ratcheting up bellicose discourse over time which
was followed by militarization. Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension
between the two states.

The Arctic, however, is not --- and **[should not]{.underline}** --- [be
destined for that **end state**]{.underline}. We, the
**[journalists]{.underline}** who report on our news, [and]{.underline}
the **[[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** who create reports, [[have a
**choice**]{.mark} in how we frame issues. Rather than always
**treating** the Arctic as a place where **competition** is
**inherent**, [we can]{.mark} **instead** [see]{.mark} it as a place of
**possible [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all, [the
**largest security threat** in the Arctic is **climate
change**.]{.underline} It impacts not only the people living in the
Arctic itself, but also states surrounding the Arctic, and the rest of
the world, as sea and ocean levels increase, oceans become desalinated,
and temperatures increase worldwide. [There is a **choice** to focus on
how [states can and have been **cooperating**]{.mark} on this issue,
thereby incentivizing **further collaboration**]{.underline} down the
line instead of thinking solely on old-school ways of thinking about
security.

HOW TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY

[While we can **think** and **write** about geopolitical **hard
security** issues in the Arctic, we can do so in a way that also gives
**airtime** to **cooperation** and **collaboration**]{.underline} rather
than thinking solely about the latest Russian military exercise or most
recent scare about Chinese investment in Greenland. This is not to say
that reporting on Russia and China is not important or necessary, but
rather, reporting in a balanced way that takes the responsibility of
reporting all sides of an issue seriously.

On a policy level, [**[policymakers]{.mark}** and diplomats]{.underline}
can --- and [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[**change** the
**framing**]{.mark} of the Arctic [in]{.mark}]{.underline} official
policies, **[[speeches]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and critical
international organizations, such as the Arctic Council. [Security
shouldn't be **only** about the construction of new **ships**,
**submarines**, and military **exercises**. [Planners]{.mark} who are
thinking about the role of **militaries** and **institutions** [should
consider]{.mark} how **security** also refers to the **[individual
security]{.mark}** of Arctic residents, [focusing on]{.mark} their
[ability to access **food** and **water**]{.mark}, potential
insecurities arising from coastal erosion]{.underline} --- 70% of which
in the Arctic is built on currently thawing permafrost --- [[as well as
**societal insecurities**]{.mark} that come about from a **lack** of
**community resilience**.]{.underline}

Lastly, [there is a tendency in **international [politics]{.mark}** to
[focus on **conflictual** issues]{.mark} when **instead** we should be
finding other, more **cooperative** issues to encourage
**relationship-building**]{.underline} among actors in the Arctic.
[Instead of **immediately pivoting** to trying to negotiate **arms
control** treaties]{.underline} amongst Arctic states, [countries could
instead [find issues, such as **transparency**, **search and
rescue**]{.mark} cooperation, [and **pollution**]{.mark} clean-up that
does not require as much **political capital**]{.underline}. These
issues might be framed as low-stakes but they should not be,
particularly if all stakeholders want to ensure that the Arctic is not
securitized.

RHETORIC MATTERS AFTER ALL

[[It **matters** how we **talk**]{.mark} about the **Arctic**.
**Whaling** is a great example of where changing **[rhetoric]{.mark}**
has [impacted **policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While in the first half
of the 20th century, whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect of
the economy, [anti-whaling **discourse** changed the **depiction** of
whales to **intelligent mammals**]{.underline}. This transformed the
perception of whaling to morally repugnant. It goes to show that the way
we talk matters, [[and]{.mark} it can [matter **more than material
interests**]{.mark} that might seem more **logical**.]{.underline}

We can continue [[to use **bellicose rhetoric**]{.mark} to describe
**relations** between states and encourage
**militarization**]{.underline} on every side, but that [[will
**end**]{.mark} exactly [the way **worse-case scenarios**
describe]{.mark} it]{.underline}. Instead, we can --- and should ---
[change the way we **talk** and **think** about the Arctic to focus on
**cooperation**]{.underline}, change the way we frame the region, and
find low-stakes issues on which to cooperate and hopefully reverse or at
least slow the trajectory of securitizing the Arctic.

#### Security is a [psychological construct]{.underline} that uses fears of [apocalypse]{.underline} to justify expanded [militarization]{.underline} and state [conquest]{.underline}. That results in an [endless]{.underline}, self-fulfilling cycle of [manufacturing]{.underline} enemies to [wage war]{.underline} against.

**Tulumello 20** \[Simone Tulumello (Assistant research professor in
human geography, Institute of Social Sciences; Ph.D. in Urban and
Regional Planning, University of Palermo), 2020, "Agonistic security:
Transcending (de/re)constructive divides in critical security studies,"
Security Dialogue, Vol. 52, Issue 4,
https://doi.org/10.1177/0967010620945081, njn\]

[[Security is]{.mark} about [the **prevention** of events **yet to
happen**]{.mark}]{.underline}; hence, the future is -- or, rather,
[**possible futures** are -- the **object** of security practice.
Preventing means **acting here** and **now** on a threat]{.underline},
which is then 'the future cause of a change in the present' (Massumi,
2005: 35). Securing is about anticipating (see Amoore, 2013; Anderson,
2010a, 2010b; Aradau and Van Munster, 2012) 'a virtual cause, or
quasicause' (Massumi, 2005: 35).7

According to Ulrich Beck (\[1986\] 1992), [among the characteristic
elements of modern society is the **emergence of 'risk'** and its
**management** as a **central** governmental **practice**]{.underline}.8
[[Risk is about]{.mark} the [**quantification** of]{.mark} the future,
and particularly [**future dangers**, in]{.mark} terms of
**[probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Aradau and Van Munster, 2012:
99--100). [The 'balance' between **prevention/anticipation** and other
dimensions becomes **central** to **security** thinking]{.underline} at
this juncture. [A self-perceived risk society **shifts** the **focus**
from the **'event'**]{.underline} -- and reactions to it -- [to the
**management** of [potential **threats**]{.mark}, which [need to be
**continuously assessed** and **anticipated**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Practices based on risk management are about calculating the trade-off
between probability and the impact of a certain event. In this
framework, [securitization is a **cost--benefit** curve: The more we
**invest**, the more we **increase security**]{.underline}, at the same
time curtailing other dimensions. [When the added cost of **increasing
securitization** becomes **bigger** than the marginal gain]{.underline}
(in terms of increased security), [the **balance** is
found]{.underline}. Economic thinking of this kind has permeated more
and more fields of governance, from the 'securitization of life'
(LoboGuerrero, 2014) to conceptualizations of crime control (Foucault,
\[2004\] 2007: 4--5; see also Becker, 1974).

In line with the hegemonic standing of the individual in Western
Enlightenment ideas (Mignolo, 2009; Mouffe, 2008; Panikkar, 1982),
individual rights are placed right at the center of the
conceptualization of the balance. This is particularly evident in the
way in which the United Nations (the quintessentially universalist
institution) envisages security, more recently in the paradigm of human
security (for an overview, see Smith, 2005: 51--55):

We recognize that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are
entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal
opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human
potential. To this end, we commit ourselves to discussing and defining
the notion of human security. (United Nations, 2005: §143)

The human security paradigm constructs a liberal individual as its
subject (see Robinson, 2016; Shepherd, 2008) and, in stressing the
interrelatedness of the 'human elements of security, rights and
development' (United Nations Human Security Unit, 2009: 6), it is
concerned about 'strik\[ing\] a balance among humanitarian, political,
military, human rights and development strategies' (Commission on Human
Security, 2003: 28; see also Panikkar, 1982: 83). Another example of the
balancing of rights, and its paradoxes, is the deployment of CCTV
systems as preventative means, a field where most regulations are
concerned with striking a balance of 'proportionality' between the
(alleged) increase of personal safety9 and the loss of privacy.10

In short, mainstream logics of security, centered on Western conceptions
of individual human rights, seek the correct balance between security
and other rights. I stress the centrality of Enlightenment conceptions
because these make the nature of contemporary security logics evident.
Lacanian planning theory (e.g. Allmendinger and Gunder, 2005; Gunder,
2003) has discussed how modernist planning -- which is rooted in
Enlightenment ideas and health and social order concerns -- is permeated
by a desire for security and certainty. It follows that [[the fantasy of
security is **central** to]{.mark} modern **[Western thinking]{.mark}**
-- as is a **permanent state** of **unfulfillment**:]{.underline}

Much of [[what we **perceive**]{.mark} of [as]{.mark} **social
[reality]{.mark}** [is actually a]{.mark} culturally **constructed**
[set of **fantasies** that seek]{.mark} to provide [a **sense of
completeness**]{.mark}, or **ontological wholeness**, that [we all
desire, but is **never actually achieved**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Gunder, 2003: 293)

Anderson (2010b: 229) has referred to [the coexistence of the **fantasy
of security** with the **impossibility** of **securing** as the 'radical
ambiguity of security'.]{.underline} Because 'living bodies can never be
completely protected' (Lorey, \[2012\] 2015: 20), securing is a never
completed task[. [Since there is **always another**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[potential **[threat]{.mark}**, another virtual cause of disruption,
**more [security]{.mark}** [calls for **more security**, in an
**unstoppable circuit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In psychosocial terms,
[these logics are typical of **relations of control**, [based on the
assumption that the **other** is always inclined to
**transgression**]{.mark} and should thus **relentlessly** prove their
**innocence**]{.underline} (Carli and Paniccia, 2003: 212--225). [The
idea of **'balancing'** between an insatiable right, **security**, and
other rights seems quite **problematic**: a **'myth'**]{.underline}
(Neocleous, 2007) [**crucial** to the construction of the **liberal
order**.]{.underline} [Security may **never be achieved**, but it is
**always worth trying harder**]{.underline}, as long as endangered
individuals exist, as summarized by two powerful statesmen:

We will chase terrorists everywhere. If in an airport, then in the
airport. So if we find them in the toilet, excuse me, we'll rub them out
in the outhouse. And that's it, case closed. (Vladimir Putin, cited in
Oliphant, 2015, emphasis added)

I want to put all the nation's resources into protecting our citizens. .
. . We will eradicate terrorism because we are attached to freedom.
(François Hollande, cited in Horobin et al., 2015, emphasis added)

For Putin and Hollande, [security **only makes sense** as a good that
institutions **must pursue** in its **purest form**: **absolute
security**]{.underline}. These formulations may be hyperbolic, but their
underlying logic is not structurally different from that at the core of
mainstream Western/liberal understandings of security -- for instance,
the UN's notion of human security (see also Christian Borch's \[2015:
95--119\] discussion of the totalitarian biopolitical character of crime
prevention). And though all these understandings of security involve
different ideas about what might be the correct balance between security
and rights, they are all concerned with striking it. Inevitably, freedom
and security end up converging -- with the latter trumping the former --
as evident in this excerpt from an interview with Italian former
center--left minister of the interior Marco Minniti:

[**Security** is **freedom**]{.underline}: It is evident that [there
**cannot** be an idea of security **without guaranteeing individual
freedom**]{.underline}; and at the same time, there is no true freedom
if everyday safety is not guaranteed. (cited in Giannini, 2017, emphasis
added)11

These contradictions are taking on an even more pronounced scale amid
recent transformations of the ways in which futures are conceptualized
in security practice. More and more, so-called [[**low-probability**,
**high-impact** events]{.mark}, along with a **focus** on
**possibility** in spite of **probability**, [have become **central** to
**security logics**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Amoore, 2013; Anderson, 2010a,
2010b). [[**Terrorism** provides]{.mark} possibly [the **most evident**
example]{.mark} of this trend]{.underline}: In the West, [[being the
victim of]{.mark} a **[terror]{.mark} attack** [is]{.mark} an event with
an **[extremely low probability]{.mark}**]{.underline},12 and [[yet
compare this with the amount of **political
discourse**]{.underline}]{.mark} and governmental resources concerned
with terrorism -- [is the late **'risk society'** concerned with
actually **measurable risks** after all?]{.underline}13 [While attention
to **low-probability**, **high-impact** events increases, [the focus
**shifts** toward]{.mark} the [management of all **behaviors**]{.mark}
and **bodies**]{.underline} that are [[considered]{.mark} to be **[out
of place]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Aradau and Van Munster, 2012; Borch,
2015). Critical thinkers have therefore argued that [the logics of
terrorism preparedness have become the **central discursive engine** in
global trends [toward the **normalization** of]{.mark} states of
[**'emergency'** and **'exception'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Adey et al.,
2015; Agamben, 2003, 2015). Needless to say, there are powerful
interests behind the securitization in the name of terrorism and other
threats -- critical urban studies, for instance, has shown how
[terrorism is the central discursive engine in the **attack** late
**capitalism** has launched against **democracy**]{.underline} (see, for
example, Rossi and Vanolo, \[2010\] 2012).

And yet, [if large **majorities**]{.underline} -- especially in the
Western world, but increasingly so in the global South -- [**support**
the allocation of so many resources to]{.underline}, along with the
constraining of their own rights in the name of, [the **fight** against
**phenomena** with such **low actual 'impact'**, this could also be due
to the fact that the **fantasy of security** seems **more real** than it
has ever been]{.underline}. After all, [[**never** in]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of mankind [have there been **societies safer**
than]{.mark} those of [the **contemporary West**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bauman, 2005). Of course, this is not valid for everyone. Security is
distributed very unevenly internally within societies, along geographic,
class, ethnic/racial, gender, and other divides, [[but most attention is
devoted to **fighting**]{.underline}]{.mark} (allegedly, see Melossi,
2003) **[[external threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### [Reject]{.underline} the 1AC's securitization as a form of [pre-emptive desecuritization]{.underline} that disrupts their [hegemonic]{.underline} discourse. That frame is [essential]{.underline} to preventing [Arctic policy]{.underline} from being [fully securitized]{.underline}.

Securitization and desecuritization The ceteris paribus normative push,
and political recommendation of the securitization approach has been
'less security, more politics', and the development of 'possible
modalities' for the desecuritization of politics (Wæver 1989a, 52): [it
is generally]{.underline} (which can only be assessed in practice
though) [more conducive to [treat **identities** as
**identities**]{.mark}, religion as religion, [the **environment** as
the **environment**, and so on]{.mark}, and [to engage]{.mark} their
[politics through]{.mark} the particular modalities and
**[rationalities]{.mark}** of those fields [rather than]{.mark} those of
**[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the received reading, whilst
securitization raises issues into the realm of security policies and
practices (arrow 2a in Figure 1), desecuritization lowers issues back
into the realm of 'regular politics' or removes issues from the
political agenda altogether (arrow 1 in Figure 1). [[Desecuritization
can be achieved through]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of options: by
[simply [not talking about issues in **terms of security**]{.mark}, by
[keeping responses]{.mark} to securitized issues in forms [that **do not
create** security **dilemmas**]{.mark} or other vicious spirals,
[and]{.mark} by [**moving** security]{.mark} issues back [into '**normal
politics'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wæver 2000, 253). These options can
follow objectivist, constructivist or deconstructivist strategies in
bringing about desecuritization (Huysmans (1995, 65--67). These
strategies differ in regard to how the process relates to the claimed
threat: has the threat been dealt with, can the security drama be
somehow handled from without, or can identities beyond security threats
be produced from within the process. [Beyond conceptualizing
desecuritization as an option or a strategy, it has also been viewed
from the viewpoint of political actors]{.underline} (de Wilde 2008,
597), [and their political moves in games of contestation and
resistance]{.underline} (Vuori 2011a, 2015). [There can be
[**desecuritizing** actors]{.mark} who evade, [circumvent]{.mark} or
directly oppose [**securitizing** moves by]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, [[emphasizing **competing threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} (de
Wilde 2008, 597). [Security policies aim at
desecuritization]{.underline} (the solution to the threatening
situation), [but [desecuritization can]{.mark} also [happen
**independently**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the actions of securitizing
or desecuritizing actors: [[the original]{.mark} security [problem may
be solved, **institutions** may **adapt**]{.mark} through new
reproductive structures, [discourses may **change**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., [[with the **loss** of]{.mark} interest or
**[audiences]{.mark}**]{.underline}), [[and the **original**]{.mark}
referent [object may be **lost**]{.mark}]{.underline} (de Wilde 2008). A
key issue of debate has been on whether desecuritization can be
considered to be an active political process, or whether
desecuritization can only happen as a fading away of the issue (Behnke
2006, 65): the question is whether the logic and possibility of
securitization is necessarily retained in explicit discussions of
whether an issue has retained the status of a security issue. As
empirical studies of securitization and desecuritization dynamics (e.g.,
Salter and Mutlu 2013; Lupovici 2014; Vuori 2015; Donnelly 2015) have
shown, it is difficult to point to a definitive end point for either
securitization or desecuritization: political and social situations
evolve. Whichever the philosophical stance on how and whether
desecuritization can be achieved (Vuori 2011a), such empirical studies
show that political actors do make active desecuritization moves.
Indeed, systematizing empirical studies of desecuritization, Hansen
(2012, 529; 539--545) has identified four ideal type forms for the
concept. In regard to its issues of concern, namely the status of enmity
and the possibility of a public sphere, when a larger conflict is still
within the realm of possibility, but when a particular issue is
presented with terms other than security, we have an instance of (1)
'change through stabilisation' (arrow 2b in Figure 1); when another
issue takes the place of a previously securitized issue, we have (2)
'replacement'; when the originally phrased threat is resolved, we have
(3) rearticulation; and finally, when potentially insecure subjects are
marginalized through depoliticization, we have (4) 'silencing' (types
2--3 are represented by arrow 1 in Figure 1). The previous literature on
both securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1) and desecuritization (arrow 1
in Figure 1) has produced ample illustrations of both dynamics. As a
brief example of how both dynamics can alter between the same political
actors, we can use some of the vicissitudes of Sino-Soviet relations.
China entered the Cold War in the Soviet camp and relied on the Soviet
Union as the guarantee of the international security of the new People's
Republic. Chinese views in the late 1940s clearly structured the world
into two opposing camps, with China firmly in the Soviet one (Mao 1949).
In the 1950s, however, Sino-Soviet relations soured, and the following
'Sino-Soviet split' (Lüthi 2008) has been used as an example of the
capacity of 'parochial' securitizations to become disaffected by or even
be withdrawn from dominant 'macrosecuritizations' (Buzan and Wæver 2009,
257). Following the split, Sino-Soviet relations in the 1960s were
characterized by intensive ideological conflict, and Mao Zedong
securitized Soviet revisionism as a major threat for the Chinese
Communist Party (Vuori 2011b). Indeed, newly available documents suggest
that it was the Chinese side, in effect Mao Zedong, which was more
active in the pursuit of ideological conflict (Lüthi 2008, 2). In his
securitization of the Soviet Union, Mao linked the revisionism he
identified there to that which he also securitized domestically (Vuori
2011b), and the issue of revisionism was presented as an issue of life
and death for the party. Sino-Soviet relations began to mend in the
1980s with the removal of a number of political obstacles and with the
intensification of the conflict between the United States and the Soviet
Union (Wishnick 2001). Yet, it is only with the fall of the Soviet Union
that we can see an overall desecuritization in the form of
rearticulation (Hansen 2012, 542--544) taking place in Sino-Russian
relations. In the aftermath of the end of the Cold War, China's line was
not to take the lead in international affairs. China worked towards
'world multipolarization', which was exemplified with China and Russia
forming a 'strategic partnership' in 1996. China and Russia even shared
the same 'threat package' of 'terrorism, separatism, and religious
extremism' (the 'three evils') within the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Jackson 2006, 310). These are strong indicators of how the
two states have managed to reform their identities away from the
Sino-Soviet antagonism. In the overall state relations then, we can see
a rearticulative desecuritization tactic at play on both sides: ever
since the early 1980s, China's policy towards the Soviet Union (and
later Russia) shifted from antagonism to one of collaboration and
negotiation rather than securitization. [[Desecuritization can be
**conceptualized**]{.mark} in the above manner [as a **negative
ontological corollary** to securitization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [it
is also prudent to investigate securitization and desecuritization as
political moves in order to potentially understand the logic of when and
how they are wielded in practical politics]{.underline}. It is proposed
here that in addition to instances where a securitized situation is
dismantled (arrow 1 in Figure 1), [[desecuritization can also be viewed
as a **political move**]{.mark} that can be deployed [before
'**securitization plays'**]{.mark} in a game of
securitization]{.underline} (arrow 2a in Figure 1). In other words,
[[desecuritization]{.mark} moves]{.underline} -- both in [terms of
[discourse]{.mark} and practice]{.underline} -- [[can be used]{.mark} in
a pre-emptive manner [before]{.mark} the threshold of [securitization is
reached]{.mark}]{.underline} (arrow 2b in Figure 1). For Wæver (2000,
254), [[**silencing** can]{.mark} be a strategy to '[pre-empt]{.mark} or
forestall **[securitization']{.mark}**. We argue here that beyond
silencing, [active **desecuritization**]{.mark} efforts [can]{.mark} be
made to **[block]{.mark}** the [escalation]{.mark} of a
contention]{.underline}. Thereby, [in addition to change through
stabilization]{.underline} (Hansen 2012) and the silencing of an issue
(Wæver 2000), [[there can be explicit **rebuttals** of **security
frames** and claims **before** they are]{.mark} solidified into
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. This tactic can be [termed 'pre-emptive
desecuritization through rebuttal'.]{.underline}

## Top Level

### Overview\-\--2NC

#### Securitization is a [psychological construct]{.underline} that [projects]{.underline} internal [anxieties]{.underline} onto external "[others]{.underline}" in an [endless pursuit]{.underline} of feeling secure. The internal desire to [anticipate]{.underline} and [manage]{.underline} threats drives us to [constantly invent]{.underline} new threats in our [environments]{.underline}, producing [endless circuits]{.underline} that [fail]{.underline} to make us more secure. This produces [harmful assumptions]{.underline} of the "other" as innately [violent]{.underline} or [aggressive]{.underline}, which make it [impossible]{.underline} to objectively evaluate [threats]{.underline}. Western societies are [safer]{.underline} than [any civilization]{.underline} in history, but securitized discourse is [more prevalent]{.underline} than ever, which proves that the [invention]{.underline} of [new threats]{.underline} to security is only a [fantasy]{.underline}. That's [1NC Tulumello]{.underline}.

#### Specifically, [identifying]{.underline} the Arctic as [innately competitive]{.underline} securitizes the region. This [obstructs]{.underline} cooperation over non-military threats, like [climate change]{.underline}, and ignores the existence of localized threats to indigenous populations. Only [rejecting]{.underline} securitized discourse of the Arctic can [prevent]{.underline} the region from [devolving]{.underline} into [perpetual war]{.underline}. That's [1NC Gricius]{.underline}.

Firstly, the [[**macrosecuritization** of climate change can be
**considered**]{.underline}]{.mark} what Buzan & Wæver (2009:261) call
[[a **physical threat** universalism]{.mark} that relates to the
**construction** of a **physical threat** as a **global
danger**]{.underline}. While this move has the "physical fate of
humankind" (ibid:261) as the referent object, [[it utilizes]{.mark} the
[physical changes that the **Arctic** experiences]{.mark} due to
**climate change** [to **exemplify**]{.mark} the
[dangers]{.mark}]{.underline} that arise. [The **[securitizing]{.mark}**
move therefore **[inevitably]{.mark}** also [contains]{.mark} a
[**securitization** of **climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Arctic, [depicting a **physical threat**]{.underline}, which can be
observed. [The [securitization]{.mark} of a threat [**depends** on its
**acceptance**]{.mark} by the audience]{.underline}, which is required
to establish exceptional measures. If the Arctic states accept the
necessity of exceptional measures to combat climate change, the issue is
moved from the stage of politicization and its handling within normal
politics to an exceptional space. [[This equals a **move away**
from]{.mark} the state of [**desecuritization** that is the
**foundation** for]{.mark} the concept of **[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Looking at the EU's Arctic
policy, the Arctic states have rejected such an attempt as part of the
push for "enhanced governance" (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European Commission
2008a:9f).

Secondly, the EU's [[securitizing]{.mark} move [serves as a **source of
insecurity**]{.mark} even if the securitization of climate change is
**not accepted**, [as it creates unpredictability]{.mark} by
**deviating** from the **rules**]{.underline} that are established
within the social arrangement in the Arctic. The integration of both the
EU's Climate Change Discourse and the concept of Arctic Exceptionalism
into the relational ontological security framework is depicted in figure
7.

[Arctic [Exceptionalism as a **trust system** traces back to]{.mark} the
cross-sectoral [desecuritization of]{.mark} Arctic [relations]{.mark}
that became institutionalized]{.underline} in the Arctic Council.
[[The]{.mark} resulting [**silencing** of **security**]{.mark} matters
and **compartmentalization** of Arctic politics [stand as
**routines**]{.mark} within the social arrangement [that result in
**stability** and **predictability**]{.mark}]{.underline} and enable
peaceful cooperation. [The EU's [**climate change** discourse has the
**potential** to threaten]{.mark} **Arctic [Exceptionalism]{.mark}**,
which is [**built upon** these **routines**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
creates unpredictability. In reaction to this, Arctic states have three
options on how to react, namely refereeing, performative deference, and
obstructive resistance. The 2008 initiative to enhance governance in the
Arctic was resisted and the EU referred to the upkeep of state
sovereignty (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European Commission 2008a:9f), thus
preserving social arrangement and the elements of Arctic exceptionalism.

Traditionally, [[the **United States**]{.mark} is not considered a
status-anxious state, since it [possesses **primacy** over]{.mark} most
hierarchies [in the **international system**]{.mark}. Diverse composite
indicators]{.underline}8 [rank the U.S. as number 1 in regard to its
**military** and **capabilities**]{.underline}, far from runner-ups, and
[its **prestige**]{.underline} - although an abstract concept - [helped
**build** and **maintain** the world order for the **last
century**]{.underline}. [American positioning in [the
**Arctic**]{.mark}, however, [is **more complex**]{.mark} than that. The
**strategic significance** of the Arctic as a frontier has **increased**
due to the region's **receding ice**]{.underline}, [opening up new **sea
routes** and potential for **resource extraction**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} shift has [made the Arctic a **focal point** for]{.mark}
geopolitical **[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The U.S. has been
**slow** to respond]{.underline}, especially compared to Russia, which
has significantly advanced its capabilities in the region. Russia's
extensive icebreaker fleet, robust military presence, and
infrastructural developments have positioned it as the leading power in
the Arctic. China, too, has made substantial investments, viewing the
Arctic as a critical area for expanding its influence. [[Status
**anxiety**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in this context, [[refers to]{.mark}
the [**fear** of]{.mark} further **[losing]{.mark}** global
**[dominance]{.mark}** and **influence**]{.underline}. For decades, the
United States has been accustomed to a position of unparalleled
geopolitical power, but [[the Arctic]{.mark} presents **new challenges**
that [**threaten** this]{.mark} status.]{.underline}

[Congressional [hearings]{.mark} on Arctic security [repeatedly
**highlight**]{.mark} the **[anxiety]{.mark}** underlying U.S. Arctic
policy]{.underline}, particularly the fear of falling behind key
competitors. [This sense of urgency, largely absent before the 2010s,
has become increasingly pronounced as lawmakers call for a more robust
U.S. presence to counteract the strategic advances of Russia and China.
Records consistently emphasize the stark disparity in
capabilities]{.underline}, such as Russia's fleet of over 30 icebreakers
compared to the United States' significantly smaller and less capable
fleet, exemplifying a critical gap in Arctic readiness.

[This anxiety is [**further reflected** in]{.mark} U.S. Arctic
**[Strategy documents]{.mark}**]{.underline} from 1994 to 2024, [[which
reveal a **dramatic increase** in references to **Russia**, **China**,
**security**, and **threats**]{.mark}. Recent [strategies
**underscore**]{.mark} the Arctic's [**transformation** into]{.mark} a
[contested **geopolitical arena**]{.mark}]{.underline}, calling for
enhanced U.S. capabilities and a heightened presence in response to
intensifying competition. [[The **shift**]{.mark} from viewing the
**Arctic** as a **low-priority** region to acknowledging its **critical
importance** [illustrates how **anxiety** about losing
**status**]{.mark} and **influence** [has driven]{.mark} a
[recalibration]{.mark}]{.underline} of U.S. policy. [These documents
signal a **recognition** that the Arctic is **no longer** a
**peripheral** concern but a **key battleground**]{.underline} for great
power rivalry, necessitating a more militarized and proactive approach
to protect American interests and sustain geopolitical standing.

Historically, [[the U.S.'s **passive**]{.mark} **Arctic
[stance]{.mark}** [stemmed from]{.mark} its **strategic focus** on
**other regions** and a [**perception** of the Arctic as
**less**]{.mark} immediately **[critical]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, the aggressive expansion of Russian and Chinese investments and
activities in the region has forced a reevaluation. [[Now faced with
**catching up**]{.mark} in a region where its **competitors** have
gained **significant footholds**, [the U.S.]{.mark} has
[embraced]{.mark} a more [**assertive** Arctic
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. This shift exemplifies how [status
**[anxiety]{.mark}**, fueled by the **rapid advancements** of rivals,
[can **catalyze**]{.mark} **strategic [action]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Congressional **hearings** and policy **documents** increasingly
**reflect this anxiety**]{.underline}, underscoring the pressing need
for the U.S. to strengthen its Arctic capabilities to safeguard its
geopolitical interests and maintain its global standing.

Conclusion

In this paper, I analyze how the evolution of U.S. Arctic policy
reflects a broader narrative of status anxiety, which has served not as
a paralyzing force but as a catalyst for strategic recalibration.
Historically, the Arctic was peripheral to U.S. foreign policy, viewed
primarily through the domestic lens of Alaska and rarely integrated into
the country's global strategy. [However, the **[changing]{.mark}
geopolitical [landscape]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[marked by the rise of
**Russia** and **China** as **key players** in the
region]{.underline}---[has [redefined the Arctic as]{.mark} a
**[critical]{.mark} frontier** for great power competition]{.underline}.
The analysis of U.S. Arctic policy documents and Congressional hearings
reveals a pattern: [the **[increasing securitization of Arctic discourse
aligns with a growing recognition of the]{.mark} region's [strategic
importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Anxiety]{.mark}** about losing
influence in the Arctic has [**propelled** the United States
toward]{.mark} more [**proactive** measure]{.mark}s, including
**alliance-building**, infrastructure **investments**, and heightened
**military engagement**]{.underline}. This shift underscores the dual
nature of anxiety: while it signals vulnerability, it also motivates
states to adapt and innovate in the face of perceived challenges.

By reframing anxiety as a constructive force, this paper contributes to
a deeper understanding of the emotional drivers behind state behavior.
[Status [anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [[offers a
**compelling lens** for **interpreting** how **hegemonic
powers**]{.mark} like the United States [respond to emerging
threats]{.mark} in **contested** regions. The Arctic's
**transformation**]{.underline} from a zone of cooperation and idealism
[to a **theater of competition** illustrates how [anxiety can
**reshape**]{.mark} priorities, **galvanize** action, [and
**redefine**]{.mark} geopolitical **[landscapes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The plan is a utopian imaginary of crisis that urges control. Embracing a localized "dirty" climate politics is the only way to detach security threats from climate mitigation.

[[Dreams of **climate security** are driven by **imaginaries** of

[control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Control-over nature, control-over
humanity, control-over populations, control-over capitalism,
control-over vulnerability, and so on. Against this, [[a
**messier**]{.mark}, more impure, less pious form of [critique
of]{.mark} our [**ecological catastrophe** is required]{.mark}. One

its violence.

But what would that mean? To trace an answer, we can turn to Virunga
National Park, which sits in the east of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC). While a haven for wildlife, biodiversity, and volcanoes,
Virunga is also a site of local and global conflict. Locally, trees are
illegally harvested from the park to produce charcoal for nearby
residents to use as cooking fuel. Globally, oil companies lobby the
government to acquire permission to drill for oil across the park. In
response, the park's director has launched numerous initiatives,
principally seeking to support the park by promoting high-end
eco-tourism, but also constructing hydropower dams to supply rural
people with electricity, and giving paramilitary training to park
rangers to protect its borders. Since COVID-19 and growing armed
conflict in the region, the innovations are more unusual, however.
Cables now run from one of those hydropower plants to a series of
shipping containers, humming audibly: the containers hold computers
mining bitcoin, purportedly turning green energy into cash to fund the
park in lieu of the disappearing of tourist dollars (Popescu 2023).

The specter of a cryptocurrency mine situated within one of the most
beautiful natural environments in the world is disquieting. Doubly so,
given Virunga's roots as Parc Albert, named after the Belgian king who
controlled the DRC during the colonial period. Triply so, when still
today the park's director is a Belgian prince, Emmanuel de Merode, who
was once subject to an assassination attempt reportedly after submitting
an inquiry into the actions of a British oil company allegedly illegally
exploring oil reserves in the park. But the example of crypto-currency
mining in the DRC is instructive precisely because of that ambivalence.
Virunga is a composite of the human and non-human, the colonial and the
postcolonial, the natural and the technological, the pure and the
impure, the modern and the traditional: patched and bricolaged together.

[[Surreal **ecologies**]{.mark} such as these [are the future of
**climate security**]{.mark}. Fixed in a space of concrete urgency,
something [that can **free us from**]{.mark} the cage of scholastic
reflexivity]{.underline} (Lynch 2000), [[the search for]{.mark}
conversation, sustainability, and **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
Virunga acknowledges that [there is no escape from being entangled with
the bizarre and contradictory]{.underline} and, on the contrary, that it
is [[only by **embracing** those **situations**]{.mark} that [we
can]{.mark} "[discern]{.mark} the [**unrealized** opportunities]{.mark}
which lie dormant in the recesses of the present]{.underline}" (Gorz
1999, 1). To see how this is the case, and what we can learn from it,
requires unpacking three intertwined political moves.

The first is a rejection of disconnection. Contemporary difficulties
with climate security seem intertwined with Mbembe's (2019, 242)
critique of decolonial theory as too insistent on calling for a gesture
of "disconnection and separation" that "cuts off one cultural or
historical entity from another." [The very concept of the Anthropocene
calls for such a cut, geologically, as do [efforts to **securitize**
that]{.mark} historical [**epoch**, and **appeals** to]{.mark}
indigenous, autonomous, or [**natural forms** of knowing sharply
**cut**]{.mark} from **[modernity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see also
Daoudy and Floyd, this forum). Against this, [the climate politics of
Virunga is mired in improvisation, impurity, and dirt]{.underline}. Such
a project recognizes that a different kind of planet politics can emerge
only by engaging what Glissant (2020, 108) once termed the Whole-World:

I call the Whole-World our universe as it changes and lives on through
its exchanges and, at the same time, the 'vision' that we have of it.
The world-totality in its physical diversity and in the representations
that it inspires in us: So that we are no longer able to sing, speak or
work based on our place alone, without plunging into the imagination of
this totality

The whole world of concern here must include not only human difference
or physical diversity but equally the humming shipping containers of
Virunga and their dirty legacies. In this, [[demands for a
different]{.mark} kind of climate [**security** must turn]{.mark} back
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} Haraway's (1987, 9--10) [earlier [**cyborg
politics** that critiqued]{.mark} the idea of [**viewing** nature as a
"**source of insight**]{.mark} and promise of innocence," instead
seeking to make-kin with "the illegitimate offspring of militarism and
patriarchal capitalism"]{.underline} which are "often exceedingly
unfaithful to their origins." A cyborg climate security that seeks a
symbiotic relation with the pure and the impure alike.

Such a cyborg politics risks -- however -- being interpreted as a
(liberal) naturalizing of the status quo. To radicalize its potentiality
requires we turn thus to a second -- tactical -- movement. Some time
ago, Che Guevara addressed the 'First International Meeting of
Architecture Students' in Havana. At the end of his speech, he said --
simply:

Never forget that [[technology is a **weapon**]{.mark}. If you feel the
world is not as perfect as it should be, then [you **must struggle** to
put the **weapon** of technology at the **service of
society**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This is also the demand of the day. [To put]{.mark} what has
become]{.underline}, but need not be, [[the **ultimate** weapon
of]{.mark} economic [**rationality**, and]{.mark} so [**climate**
catastrophe]{.mark} -- technology -- to different ends]{.underline}.
Here, [the **[rejection]{.mark}** of disconnection [must move
**beyond**]{.mark} a simple **[acknowledgment]{.mark}** of entanglement,
creolization, and hybridity, [towards]{.mark}]{.underline} -- instead --
[[an **activist**]{.mark} guerrilla [**critique** of]{.mark} the
patterns that order [existing **hierarchies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, [in his plea for developing an 'autonomous design' sensitive to
the ecological]{.underline}, Arturo [Escobar notes how [such a politics
**requires** local spaces]{.mark} to cultivate a "successful structural
coupling]{.underline} with their globalized environments" (Escobar 2018,
188). [It is this question of developing a subversive 'structural
coupling' with modernity, capital, and globalization that most requires
answering today]{.underline}: a parasitic coupling, a guerrilla
foquismo, which improvises its way towards transformation. In opposition
to the coloniality of Virunga's management, for instance, residents
surrounding the park engage in forms of guerilla agriculture that
challenge its securitizing tendencies (Cavanagh and Benjaminsen 2015).
The surreal ecologies of Virunga emerge also from those resistances, and
the need to improvise -- ad hoc -- symbiotic relations with them[. A
[cyborg **climate security** is]{.mark} thus **[not only dirty]{.mark}**
and impure, [but **also** about]{.mark} the [**violent negotiation** of
**subjectivities**, achieved through]{.mark} the cultivation of guerilla
[**tactics** of **resistance** and refusal]{.mark}]{.underline} (c.f.
Ochigame 2020, as well as Chandler, this forum).

### Link\-\--Cyberattacks

#### Cybersecurity rhetoric use [embellished]{.underline}, opaque threats to create [fear]{.underline} that normalize [control]{.underline} and [surveillance]{.underline} over society.

Security Group, University of London), "Cyber security and the
leviathan," Computers & Security, Volume 116, May 2022, 102674,

[[It is **not in the interests** of]{.mark} a Hobbesian [society to
achieve "**complete security**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017
(1951, p. 184). Both [[the]{.mark} relative [**novelty** of
cyber]{.mark}-security [threats and]{.mark} the continued
**[emergence]{.mark}** of new types of such threats, including the
'sophisticated' aspects thereof, [can be]{.mark} viewed as "[new
**props**]{.mark} from the outside"]{.underline} (Arendt, 2017 (1951, p.
184) [[that stoke]{.mark} the flames of [the **possibility of
war**]{.mark}, particularly when attributed to nation
states.]{.underline} These [threats also offer "new and ever-growing
fields for the honorable and profitable employment]{.underline}"
(Hobson, 1900, p. 28) of citizens,28 particularly the bourgeoisie who
are appeased by new job opportunities, and further stimulate consumption
and growth (Arendt, 2017 (1951). [In a (post)modern world [where
threats]{.mark} to the state [are **less obvious**]{.mark} or apparent,
i.e., there is no obvious invader on the doorstep]{.underline},
particularly since the end of the Cold War, [[the inclination]{.mark} of
the citizen [towards **obedience** may be **weaker**. The state]{.mark}
may]{.underline}, therefore, [feel the need to **[motivate
obedience]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} making it clear that it is still
[offering **protection**]{.mark}, but not against obvious
invaders]{.underline}. Rather, it is [[against **opaque**]{.mark},
mysterious, and highly sophisticated [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, from
which the state is providing protection. [Not only do these threats need
to be explained by specialists, due to their complexity, they also need
to be 'sold' to citizens through education]{.underline}. It is even
conceivable that such teachings could be contrary to "true Philosophy"
(Hobbes, 1985, p. 703) but serve the benefit of the state, as well as
securing the continued employment of the teacher (Arendt, 2006). [[This
could **motivate**]{.mark} the **[embellishment]{.mark}** of any threats
communicated]{.underline}. It may be more advantageous for the state
Leviathan to have such education delivered not through a state organ but
rather through another component of society such as businesses. Rather
than a conscious decision taken by the Leviathan this may be a
fortuitous benefit, but one that it seeks to encourage through, e.g.,
[communicating the 'responsibility' that businesses have in protecting
wider society against cyber threats]{.underline} (Government, 2016).
[Dedicated cyber-security functions support, and repeat, messages
relating to a broader security agenda]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2008),
both among a company's employees and their customers. [[There is a
**wider security** industry that]{.mark} "must [ensure]{.mark} that
[security is **never**]{.mark} **really
[achieved]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2008, p. 156). [This
provides **commercial benefits**, as well as [**supporting** an
**insecurity** that is **relied on by the state** to]{.mark} achieve its
aims]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2008), as previously noted by Arendt (2017
(1951). [[If states]{.mark} ultimately [seek]{.mark} the perpetuation
of]{.underline} (at least **[[partial]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [then [it may be in their
**interests** to define 'security' in an insecure
manner]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the same time encouraging organisations
and wider society to achieve a level of 'insecure security'. [Recent
[attempts by **governments** to **weaken**]{.mark} or **circumvent**
strong [encryption]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g. Google (2019); Thomson
(2019), some successful, e.g. Taylor (2019), [can be argued as
[demonstrat]{.mark}ing [this]{.mark} desire]{.underline}.29 In addition,
[motivating organisations to operate a cyber-security function that
inures employees]{.underline}, who are also citizens, [to increased and
intrusive surveillance and monitoring may also contribute to
this]{.underline} same "insecure security", albeit potentially providing
associated benefits to those employees, such as greater privacy. These
organisations taught their staff about the existence of cyber-security
threats, communicated a defined set of rules, indoctrinated them into
acceptable behaviours, monitored their compliance against these, and
punished them when they transgressed. In order for both the organisation
and their staff to be protected from these threats, staff must forgo
certain liberties and agree to certain controls, such as being
surveilled. In this manner, [[the]{.mark} employeeas-[citizen is
**indoctrinated** into a **mindset** of]{.mark} being subject to [cyber
threats]{.mark} and becomes inured to the custom of [**exchanging
privacy** for security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considering power relations
as interactive, processual and two-way (Benwell and Stokoe, 2006, p.
89), [cyber security within business can be seen as a mechanism through
which citizen-employees participate in the maintenance of hegemonic
power]{.underline}.30 [Cyber security personnel ensure that messages of
insecurity and threat are repeated, as well as performing a policing
role that normalises surveillance]{.underline}, while other
citizen-employees support hegemonic power in the role they play as the
surveilled. [[Cyber]{.mark} security [can]{.mark} be used to
[**terrorise** citizens into **compliance**]{.mark} and to justify their
surveillance]{.underline}. Cyber-security controls have an effect not
just on the employee-as-employee but also the employeeas-citizen.
Educating employees on what they need to be protected from, and what
they need to obey in order to be protected, may, directly or indirectly,
inure or condition employees towards broader obedience, including
acceptance of controls that could be used beyond purposes of cyber
security, providing benefits to the state beyond citizen protection.31
[[The]{.mark} use, and [**acceptance**, of **surveillance**]{.mark} in
these organisations may [function as a **normative
control**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Beech, 2008), [conditioning or preparing
staff (citizens) to be surveilled in wider society and supporting a
wider metanarrative in relation to security]{.underline} versus privacy.
The Leviathan-writsmall of the business plays a role on behalf of the
state Leviathan in conditioning the employee-as-citizen towards
obedience, and surrendering of liberties, in exchange for protection
from threat. [[The **opaque**]{.mark} and relatively unseen [nature of
the threat, which **requires specialists**]{.mark} to deliver education
about its existence, [is **beneficial**]{.mark} to the state [for
ensuring]{.mark} continued **[obedience]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and even
in maintaining its own identity (Heraclides, 2012), and its own history
(Sims, 2005).

#### Cybersecurity as a field relies on control over society\-\--it replicates systems of state control over the citizenry.

**Da Silva 22** \[Joseph Da Silva (Ph.D. researcher, Information
Security Group, University of London), "Cyber security and the
leviathan," Computers & Security, Volume 116, May 2022, 102674,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.102674, njn\]

[[Cyber]{.mark} security was [an area of **discipline** and]{.mark} of
**[punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Organisations]{.mark} in this
study **[required obedience]{.mark}** from their staff, [in]{.mark}
terms of [policy **compliance**, as well as **alignment** with]{.mark}
standards of **[behaviour]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Obedience]{.underline}, whether through completion of mandatory
training, compliance with cyber security policies and standards, or
[through effective management of cyber-security risk, was mandatory and
[non-compliance would be punished]{.mark}]{.underline}. As well as
disciplinary action, non-compliance resulted in impacts upon staff
remuneration, particularly at a senior level. The potential for the
organisation to remove a level of security from its staff, in terms of
the security of continued employment and income, suggests what Barkan26
describes as an "immunitary dynamic" (Barkan, 2012, p. 89). As with the
Leviathan, [these [businesses were providing **protection** in
**exchange**]{.mark} for obedience and if this obedience was not
received, their protection could be removed]{.underline}. As discussed
above, [the Leviathan is tyrannical]{.underline}. While our study has
not focused on all aspects of corporate life, some indications of
tyranny that align with Friedrich and Brzezinski (1961 (1956)
[description of typical [**totalitarian features** were
observed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [cyber]{.mark} security
[departments]{.mark} in these organisations appeared to [function as an
official **police** force]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite CISOs wishing to
avoid this characterisation, and performed surveillance of staff. They
acted as agents of the mini-Leviathan, applying discipline and
punishment. Beyond cyber security, these organisations applied
punishments if staff did not comply with their dictates, including if
they behaved contrary to their values. [This may also have been
[motivated by a **lack of parity** between]{.mark} the interests of [the
**organisation** and]{.mark} the interests of individual
[employees]{.mark}. Punishment was imbued with morality by extending a
concept of 'doing the right thing'.]{.underline} These organisations
educated and indoctrinated their staff, with fear being a component of
these processes. [[Cyber security was]{.mark} also [associated with
state-directed **punishment**. The **threat** of punishments]{.mark}
relating to cyber security [had a **regulatory effect**]{.mark} on these
organisations]{.underline}, with considerable attention paid in the
annual reports to addressing how compliance was monitored and enforced,
including references to the organisational capabilities charged with
these responsibilities. Organisations in this study wanted to "do the
right thing" in order to avoid punishment by the Leviathan and
internally, as mini-Leviathans, instituted mechanisms of punishment for
their employees, extending that same concept. The references that
participants made to the "usefulness" of cyber security incidents
affecting other organisations, including explicit references to those
that resulted in regulatory action, suggest a Hobbesian view of
punishment as providing examples for others but also a spectacular
nature to cybersecurity punishment. This is similar to that described by
both Foucault (1991 (1977) and Farley (2001), 27 and punishment itself
is a representation of power (Foucault, 1991 (1977). [The Leviathan is
[**terrorised** by cyber]{.mark}-security [threats, whether **real or
imagined**]{.mark}, which, in the most fearful type, arise from the
Leviathan's known enemies]{.underline}. It expects its "lesser
Common-wealths" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 375) to take action against these
threats for the benefit of the larger commonwealth. [Failure to obey
results in punishment by the Leviathan, such punishments being public
spectacles that provide examples to others]{.underline}.

### Link\-\--Disease

#### Securitized [pandemic rhetoric]{.underline} justifies [mass violence]{.underline} and [suspension]{.underline} of human rights as '[collateral damage]{.underline}' in the '[war on disease]{.underline}.' That turns case\-\--[securitization]{.underline} enables pharmaindustry to deliberately [perpetuate]{.underline} and [profit]{.underline} from illness.

**Rawlinson 17** \[Paddy Rawlinson (Associate Professor in International
Criminology, Western Sydney University), 2017, "12. Pharmatechnologies
and the ills of medical progress," The Routledge Handbook of Technology,
Crime and Justice, pp. 221-225, njn)

[[In the]{.mark} commercially driven [process of **securitizing
health**, knowledge production plays a **crucial
role**]{.mark}]{.underline}, operating both [as a **tool** and a
**good**]{.underline}. [[Security]{.mark} as a commodity [**requires**
the **consumer**]{.mark}]{.underline} (here the public, the state and
the medical profession) [to **[buy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (literally)
[[into]{.mark} a [belief that]{.mark} the **[security products]{.mark}**
offered [are **effective**]{.mark} in obviating or at least
**weakening** the risk of **disease**]{.underline} or illness. [This
further involves ensuring that **any risk** involved in consuming the
product]{.underline}, in this case the vaccine, [is **overridden** by
the threat posed by the **disease** against which it is affording
**protection**]{.underline}. [Creating a **vigorous market** for
business in a **competitive** environment]{.underline}, as studies of
corporate crime have consistently shown, [can involve a range of
**deviant** and **criminal** strategies and activities, including
[**fraud**, **corruption**, **intimidation** and **bribery**]{.mark},
activities that [are]{.mark} **ubiquitous** and, in some cases,
**[systemic within industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Historically 'Big
Pharma' has a poor track record for ethical behaviour (Braithwaite 1984;
Dukes et al. 2014; Gotzsche 2013; Griffin and Miller 2011). Healy
observes that unlike other health-risk businesses such as tobacco and
the chemicals industry, in which 'the best studies systematically point
to hazards where they exist' and where company studies tend to be a
small component of evidence-production, often viewed with suspicion as
being partial, the same does not pertain to the pharmaceutical industry:

with pharmaceuticals often the only studies are those of the drug
companies themselves, and these studies, as one might expect, all seem
to point to the beneﬁts of an ongoing use of the very chemicals that may
in fact be causing the problem. (Healy 2012: 119)

Alongside vested-interest knowledge production, [the pharmaceutical
industry engages in other **nefarious activities**]{.underline}. [These
include **[obstructing]{.mark}** the publication of **[negative
data]{.mark}** from clinical trials in medical journals]{.underline},
which are often ﬁnancially dependent on industry for advertising and the
sale of reprints; [**[intimidating whistle-blowers]{.mark}** amongst
medical **researchers** and **doctors**]{.underline} concerned about the
safety of particular drugs; [[and]{.mark} the ubiquitous practice of
[**aggressively promoting** products]{.mark} to the medical
**profession** including providing **ﬁnancial inducements** to win
**support**]{.underline} for a particular drug (Gotzsche 2013; Healy
2012; Moynihan 2001). Nor are [these deviant and **harmful
practices**]{.underline} occasional aberrations, but instead
[[reﬂect]{.mark} recidivist [behaviour **embedded** within the
**industry**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Braithwaite 1984; Dukes et al. 2014).

Despite a long history of insalubrious behaviour in the pharmaindustry,
[**governments** and intergovernmental organizations such as the WHO
continue to **focus** on **pharmaceuticalized solutions**
to]{.underline} what are arguably [pharmaceutically **constructed**
health risks. While **obfuscating** or **down-playing** the **safety**
issues around the escalating administration]{.underline} of medical
interventions, [the pharmaindustry's **intensified participation** in
research and **policy-making** enables it to **construct narratives** of
**high risk** around both the nature of **diseases** and their
**prevalence**]{.underline}, and exaggerate the efficacy of its
products, thereby [creating an **ever-expanding** market]{.underline}
(Healy 2012; Gotzsche 2013). This is especially the case in a product
that is administered to a population. [The vaccine industry is highly
**proﬁtable** not only because of its **numerical reach** but because,
in an increasing range of jurisdictions, vaccines carry a **mandatory
status**]{.underline}.

[[These]{.mark} policies]{.underline}, which for critics of mandatory
medical intervention, are regarded as a blatant violation of human
rights, [[have been **legitimized** through]{.mark} the **discursive
modalities** of **[securitization]{.mark}**, in much [the same
way]{.mark} that [**torture** and **extraordinary rendition** were
reconstructed as **necessary** for]{.mark} the [protection of the **very
phenomena** they were]{.mark} consistently
**[eroding]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Chossudovsky 2005). In both cases,
where the market operates as a crucial driver, in which defensive
mechanisms are for sale, whether vaccines or arms, [there must be **no
limitation to demand**]{.underline}. [Creating demand through the
**security narrative** and **ensuring supply** through **mandate**
enables the **constant proliferation** of an industry which
simultaneously **protects** and **destroys**]{.underline}. Excessive
protection can only lead to destruction (consider the proliferation of
nuclear arms during the Cold War in what was termed MAD --- mutually
assured destruction). [Esposito captures this in his **consideration**
of the process of **over-immunization** as a political, juridical as
well as **bio-political phenomenon**]{.underline}, whereby 'the warring
potential of the immune system is so great that at a certain point it
turns against itself as a real and symbolic catastrophe leading to the
implosion of the whole organism' (2011: 17). Yet, as has been made clear
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the voracious appetite
of the market in its neoliberal manifestation continues apace ignoring
the social and economic cannibalism of excessive profit---seeking. For
the pharmaindustry that involves the presence, real or imaginary, of a
constant threat of disease and infection.

State of infection

In its 2006 action plan to 'increase vaccine supply' the WHO informs us
that 'Inﬂuenza vaccine development and employment are critical elements
of pandemic inﬂuenza preparedness'. In explaining how serious this risk
of a pandemic actually is, and the consequent justification for spending
billions of dollars on ﬂu vaccines globally, the WHO slips into
'Rumsfeldian discourse' describing the 'the global burden of seasonal
inﬂuenza' as an 'unknown' (WHO 2006). We are now familiar with unknowns
in their both knowable and unknowable states as being crucial to the
extension of state power with its affiliate abuses. The 'unknown burden'
of seasonal ﬂu has occasioned not only the mass manufacture of a vaccine
that, in its current stage of development has proven to be less than
effective (Gallagher 2015), but also the introduction of mandatory
policies around the inﬂuenza vaccine for health workers and other
professionals (Babcock et al. 2010). Indeed, mandating a range of
vaccines has now become established practice in a number of countries
including the US, Australia, France and Canada, with the UK being a
notable exception.

Mandatory creep has been occurring over the past few decades, overriding
the hitherto right to abstain from vaccination programmes on the basis
of religious or 'conscientious objection' (a term originally used for
nineteenth-century vaccine objectors and subsequently adopted by the
military for those who refused compulsory conscription on similar
grounds) in many cases leaving medical exemption the only acceptable
criterion for refusal. Vaccine programmes involve mass immunization or
herd immunity in which a large percentage of the population is required
to be vaccinated against a disease to ensure its control and hopefully
gradual eradication, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
against possible infection. Unlike other medical interventions, the
focus here lies on the protection of the population rather than an
individual. For Foucault, immunization represents a distinctive break
from other medical relationships which seek to heal the individual, but
operates as 'a way of individualizing the collective phenomenon of the
disease, or of collectivizing the phenomena, integrating individual
phenomena within a collective field, but in the form of the rational and
identiﬁable' (2004: 60). This brings another dimension to the philosophy
of reponsibilization that dominates the neoliberal concept of health, a
paradoxical position that transforms individual accountability into
sacrifice (for even the strongest advocates of mandatory vaccination
admit there is no such thing as one hundred per cent safety). It is a
subtly crafted moral sleight of hand that turns adherence to the market
of and for pharmatechnologies into an abnegation of self, where the self
operates not simply as part of the collective but as subservient to it:
capitalism functioning through a 'communist' guise. Human rights can
thus be dismissed as 'nonsense upon stilts' or perhaps worse still, as
the greatest threat to human rights itself.

Given that the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights emerged from inter alia
some of the most horriﬁc medical abuses ever recorded it is even more
ironic that the policy of mandatory vaccination is proliferating. It
contravenes human rights contained within a number of conventions which
establish individual autonomy regarding medical intervention. This
includes Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights on the
respect for one's private life, that is 'the right not to be physically
interfered with' (Liberty 2015) and more speciﬁcally, the International
Covenant on Political and Civil Rights protection against 'torture or to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no
one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific
experimentation' (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
1966).

[The combined [rhetoric of **security**]{.mark} and science,
**fundamental** to the justification and **waging of war**, [not only
assuages]{.mark} the [**retraction** of **human rights**]{.mark}
obligations by the state [but can render these rights]{.mark} themselves
[as]{.mark} presenting [a **threat**]{.mark}. [As the **war on
disease**]{.mark}, together with that on terror, [has **no defined
end**]{.mark}, no clear **moment of victory**, being non-territorial
insofar as it has no physical jurisdiction, [the]{.mark} suspension or
[**weakening** of]{.mark} human [rights will]{.mark} continue and
[further **entrench**]{.mark} the '**paradigm of [security]{.mark}** [as
the **normal technique**]{.mark} of government']{.underline} (Agamben
2005: 14). In this environment vaccine objection easily slips into
criminalized activity and criticism appears as unpatriotic. Concerns
over conﬂict of interest, data manipulation, bribery and intimidation
are turned into politicized opposition and those who voice these
concerns become enemies of the people, a security threat, health
terrorists. In this context, punitive measures against those who refuse,
both for themselves or on behalf of those under their guardianship, are
also becoming more draconian and can range from financial penalties, the
exclusion of children from day care centres, loss of jobs (within the
medical profession) or even prison (Willsher 2014).

Informed consent lies at the heart of the numerous instruments for the
protection of the human body; the notion of bodily integrity underpins a
series of rights that have been allocated to citizens in democratic
states, including the right to abortion. When the information aspect of
informed is either denied or contains negative data concerning safety it
is rational to assume that consent might not be always forthcoming.
Collusion between industry and politics is a major concern, as
Eisenhower warned. Mary Holland's critique of mandatory vaccination lays
out the extent of these collusive relationships in the US, which were
even admitted by politicians themselves:

In 2000, a Congressional report on Conﬂicts of Interest in Vaccine
Policy Making identiﬁed notable conﬂicts of interests in the FDA
\[Federal\] and CDC \[Center for Disease Control\] advisory bodies that
make national vaccine policy. These include 'advisers' ﬁnancial ties to
vaccine manufacturers' as well as 'advisers' permitted stock ownership
in companies affected by their decisions'. (Holland 2012:77)

Declaring these activities in Congress has not deterred their
occurrence. In 2007, an attempt was made by the erstwhile Governor of
Texas, Rick Perry, to mandate the HPV vaccine in his state's schools, a
decision he was subsequently forced to overturn when it was revealed
that Merck, the company that produced the Gardasil vaccine, had given
donations towards his nomination (Eggen 2011). Nor will this be the last
cosy relationship between politics and industry as mandatory vaccination
policy continues to be applied to an increasing number of vaccines.

Conclusion

**[[Pharmatechnologies]{.underline}]{.mark}** manifesting as medical
research, drug production and distribution, epistemological paradigms
determining how health, disease and risk are to be conceptualized and
negotiated, [[have]{.mark} now [become a **mode of governance** in an
increasingly **authoritarian** environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
not to detract from the benefits accrued from medical progress through
pharmaceuticals and the important role played by vaccines in alleviating
potential suffering. Yet, [[the **benign discourses**]{.mark} within
which they operate can often [obscure]{.mark} **harmful outcomes**,
harms imposed as [**structural violence**: opaque, **unidentiﬁable** and
**normalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zizek 2009). [Victimization remains
unseen or [as a **necessary price**]{.mark} to pay [for the **greater
good**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In medical terms aspects of these harms are
referred to as iatrogenesis, the unintended, often injurious,
consequences of medical intervention. In this latter context it is [akin
to what military circles euphemistically term **'collateral damage'**,
generally applied to the **killing** and **maiming** of non-
combatants]{.underline}. However, some scholars who study state and
corporate harms are less inclined to semantic generosity, not least when
[[the majority of **damage**]{.mark} and injury inﬂicted [falls
on]{.mark} the same targets, [the socio-economically **vulnerable**,
**gendered**, **racial**, **ethnic** or other
**minorities**]{.mark}]{.underline} whose lot it is to comprise the
ﬂotsam and jetsam of ruthless markets and the politics of indifference.
Intention, or lack of, as they argue, cannot disguise the power
relations at play as the usual suspects emerge as perpetrators and
beneficiaries of systemic abuses.

If we are to accept the argument put forward by Tombs and Whyte that
'The problems caused by corporations --- which seriously threaten the
stability of our lives --- are enduring and necessary functions of the
corporation' (2015: 4), a position supported by a plethora of cases,
then [all industry operating within a **capitalist framework** is
**intrinsically pathological**. It is essentially a diseased entity,
irrespective of the nature of goods and services produced or the
rhetoric that designates it as benign]{.underline}. Ironically, this
diseased entity in combination with an increasingly diseased political
system, proclaims and even persists that it has both the authority and
ability to produce and sell health. Yet, [so strong is the belief in
pharmaceuticalized health that so many literally buy into the 'truths'
of pharmatechnologies failing miserably to discern how the
contagion-riddled commodification of health is actually the greatest
danger to health.]{.underline}

No business thrives on the elimination of demand for its goods. The
technologies of war were justiﬁed through the eventual establishment of
peace; so too [the [pharmaindustry **legitimizes its existence** through
claims to **health**]{.mark} and healing. [The existence]{.mark} of both
[is **dependent** on the **perpetuation** of]{.mark} the very
[**phenomena** they **claim to defend**]{.mark} us
[from]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in this [they must **continue** to be
**producers** of war and **sickness**]{.underline}. No longer does the
potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exist, as
Eisenhower warned, it has become fundamental to the industries of war
and disease, to war on disease.

#### The discourse of disease relies on biopolitical securitization of the military industrial complex -- that causes perpetual war

[Western societies entered the 20 century in an era of infectious
disease]{.underline}. In the United States, for example, tuberculosis
was the number one killer while small pox, diphtheria, tetanus and other
infectious diseases were prevalent. [Curative medicine, allied to [other
biopolitica]{.mark}l 'social' security strategies, transformed the
morbidity [of western populations]{.mark}, however, by virtually
[eliminating]{.mark} such [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Consequently, an entirely different demographic of morbidity has
emerged. [This new landscape is characterised by chronic rather than
infectious diseases. Chronic diseases are in turn [distinguished by a
variety of significantly different features from those which
characterised infectious disease]{.mark}.]{.underline} These features
include the following. 1. First, susceptibility to chronic illness is a
universal among western populations. 2. Second, chronic illnesses are
characterised by early onset. 3. Third, chronic illnesses are
progressive. 4. Fourth, such illnesses become clinical explicit only at
certain symptom thresholds; angina or heart attack signalling the
presence, for example, of heart disease that has been developing for
many years. 5. Fifth, chronic illnesses are multifactorial. 6. Sixth,
differences between individuals are manifested by the rate at which such
diseases progress rather than the bald presence or absence of the
disease. 7. Seventh, the onset and rate of progress of chronic illness
is a direct function of exposure to risk factors. [These in turn are
very much a function of how lives are lived; 'life styles'. Whereas
infectious disease invited drug cures, chronic illnesses invite
pre-emption and prevention together with medical campaigns aimed at
changing life-styles, backed by widespread [use of surveillance]{.mark}
(or 'screening' in medical terms) and the statistical documentation of
the incidence of disease distribution spatially as well as temporally.
All these developments have in turn begun to be combined with the
pervasive regulation and management of risk]{.underline}, and the
astonishingly greater resolution given to the analytic of risk which
resonates throughout all aspects of western society. [Closely allied
with the concern for risk factors arising from life-styles, is an
intense individualisation and personalisation of medicine as
well.]{.underline} [Whereas Foucault spoke of the ways in which liberal
biopolitical governmentality encouraged the development of the
entrepreneurial self,]{.underline} 53 the compression of morbidity
witnesses the emergence of a self entrepreneurially responsibilised to
secure its own health care[. Such developments similarly also reflect
the intense preoccupation in [military corporate and homeland
security]{.mark} domains with the same kinds of preoccupations and
analytical devices allying screening and surveillance with
distribution-patterning and risk analysis across mass populations
locally as well as globally. The [biopoliticisation of security
discourse]{.mark} in these more traditional areas of security analysis
also reflects amassive shift to pre-emptive and preventative
strategies]{.underline}. While we do not have the space to trace the
connections, the correlation is no mere accident. Granted that both
military and corporate strategies are driven by their own local and
global dynamics, [their informationalisation and biologisation
nonetheless also directly reflects these developments as well. The
reason we maintain is that they not only borrow from, and leach into,
one another. [They share a similar if diffuse account of the
'real'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Sensing

#### Arctic security imaginaries are a testing ground for global techniques of sovereign control.

**Johnson 24** \[Benjamin Johnson (Assistant Professor of Humane
Artificial Intelligence and International Relations, University of
Groningen), , "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical imaginaries of
security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, Vol. 12,
No. 2, pp. 187-208, njn\]

[[Sociotechnical imaginaries are **collective visions**]{.mark} of the
future [**interlaced** with]{.mark} notions of **scientific
[progress]{.mark}** [and **advancement**]{.mark} towards achieving or
navigating that future]{.underline}. Sociotechnical imaginaries provide
a unique framing mechanism for understanding how [[the Arctic
was]{.mark} historically [presented as a **future frontier** to be
**tamed** through]{.mark} **scientific [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}
within a broader lens of economic expansion and modernisation that
populated the early 20th century and post-war vision. The Cold War
entailed a more overtly securitised imaginary, whereas
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} 21st-century [[Arctic entails]{.mark}
**different [combinations]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} earlier **imaginaries**
within a **contemporary field** of [**expanded threats** and
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}, ultimately [culminating in the **New
Arctic**]{.underline}. Others have already defined [the New
Arctic]{.underline}, but in this context, it [is the **sociotechnical
expression** [of multiple]{.mark} international and global [trends
**underpinned** by]{.mark}]{.underline} a particular
[**[interaction]{.mark}** of forces]{.underline}. Sociotechnical
imaginaries involve ontological and epistemological issues. [[State-led
efforts towards]{.mark} **enhancing [sensing]{.mark}**
[abilities]{.mark} in the Arctic [represent]{.mark} a specific
[**epistemic approach** to]{.mark} an ontology of [**complexity**, which
**resists**]{.mark} easy and **direct
[intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The empirical material discussed
in this paper is not exhaustive and should not be seen as overly
authoritative. However, as a whole, that material demonstrates a
consistent approach to understanding the contemporary Arctic
environment, and the interaction of efforts in the marine and space
domains illustrate this approach to Arctic security.

Thus, the Arctic imaginaries of the present echo some aspects of the
past. However, while the imaginary of the past portrayed the Arctic
frontier as a space that would ultimately be conquered through science
and technological superiority, [[the]{.mark} **contemporary** [frontier
**dissolves** in]{.mark} the face of **[science and tech]{.mark}nology**
[because]{.mark} it is [those]{.mark} same forces that
**[undermine]{.mark}** the Arctic's **[environmental
integrity]{.mark}**]{.underline} and expose it to extra-sovereign
interventions. As with any sociotechnical imaginary, [[imagined
futures]{.mark} often **[encounter]{.mark}** the **[limits of
tech]{.mark}nology**, including its socioeconomic **valorisation** in
the world]{.underline}. The earlier sociotechnical imaginary of a
'Canada of the North' never materialised for many reasons, including the
technical and economic realities of building northern infrastructure. It
is within this wider sociotechnical lens that [[sensing
tech]{.mark}nologies [gain]{.mark} their [**currency** and
**form**]{.mark}, especially [as]{.mark} they are [an attractive
**policy goal** that is]{.mark} malleable to multiple and possibly
**[contradictory]{.mark}** sociotechnical imaginaries]{.underline} of
the Arctic's future.

[Sociotechnical [imaginaries]{.mark} thus [amount to **more**
than]{.mark} simple [**representations** and (re)produce **relations of
power**]{.mark} that circumscribe the dominant ontological foundations
of the world]{.underline}. Consequently, [[the New Arctic is
**shaping**]{.mark} forms of **state [intervention]{.mark}** [and
**governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper has argued that [the
Arctic is a region considered [within a **relational worldview**
premised on **complexity** and **risk**]{.mark}, which makes future
threats increasingly **[challenging to predict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Consequently, [the New Arctic requires **techniques** of sovereign power
and **governance** that can **make sense** of this
environment]{.underline}. These techniques depend on technological
innovation related to advances in sensing capability because the sheer
complexity of this environment overwhelms human cognition.

This paper demonstrates how [[the New Arctic is]{.mark} a sociotechnical
imaginary [shaping]{.mark} the **development** of **[sensing
tech]{.mark}nologies** designed [for **sovereign enforcement**
through]{.mark} the example of **space-based [surveillance]{.mark}**
capabilities [and]{.mark} the use of **[intelligence]{.mark}**
applications]{.underline} like the BlueHawk product. While the Arctic
represents a unique space where these technologies are being developed
and deployed[, the proliferation of [**sensing** represents a]{.mark}
much **[larger trend]{.mark}** in geostrategic thinking]{.underline}.
However, [current efforts are **only possible** within the contemporary
**security landscape's** broader **social** and **political**
context]{.underline}. A recent evolution in that thinking flows from the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and involves the acceleration of debates on
what it means for Arctic governance. This issue speaks to the
re-internationalisation of Arctic security alongside its globalisation,
intensifying the complexity and intensity of those issues. Future
research should engage with this trend more substantially, particularly
as Canada's focus on Arctic sensing aligns with US and NORAD strategic
thinking for continental defence and as sensing technology intersects
with other developments in artificial intelligence and quantum. Overall,
[the cases discussed here offer one example of a much **larger trend**
in defence thinking, and technological development centred on
integrating global [sensor architectures]{.mark} to pre[-emptively
**secure** the **Arctic**]{.mark} of today [**from** the
**world**]{.mark} **of tomorrow**.]{.underline}

## Framework

#### Prioritizing epistemology is [best]{.underline}:

#### 1. Representations [inform]{.underline} reality\-\--the way we [talk]{.underline} about policy determines its [real-world]{.underline} implementation. 

#### 2. [Education]{.underline}\-\--[What]{.underline} and [how]{.underline} we learn from debate is the [only thing]{.underline} we [take out]{.underline} of it.

#### 3. [Footnoting DA]{.underline}. If the plan [always comes first]{.underline}, then criticisms of language [never get addressed]{.underline}\-\--problematic claims get [brushed]{.underline} to the side as soon as the AFF says "[extinction outweighs]{.underline}." 

### Framework\-\--AT: Fairness\-\--2NC

#### 1. Fairness is an [internal link]{.underline}, not an [impact]{.underline}\-\--debate isn't meaningful [because]{.underline} of its [rules]{.underline}, but because of the [education]{.underline} it produces. You should [weigh]{.underline} the impact of [educational]{.underline} debate higher than perfectly [fair]{.underline} debate.

61, Issue 1, pp. 64-77, njn\]

In the modern context, [the **intimate linkage** between politics and
knowledge is **established** and **reproduced** through
**separation**]{.underline}. [[Only by **distancing**]{.mark} itself
[from]{.mark} the particularities of **[politics]{.mark}** and
developing the language of universal reason [can **science**
establish]{.mark} its **[political releva]{.mark}nce**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} paradoxical relationship [turns on its head the]{.mark}
widely shared [assumption that]{.mark} increasing levels of
**[abstraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}---from empirical to theoretical
and metatheoretical work---[[**undermine** political
relevance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, [with **every step away** from
concrete policies, [academic **studies**]{.mark} address **broader
questions**, speak to **wider audiences**, and [play a]{.mark} **more
[foundational]{.mark}** [role]{.mark} for politics]{.underline}
(Eriksson 2014, 102). [Each of these levels of
**[abstraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, moreover, [[constitutes an
**integral** part of]{.mark} **modern [science]{.mark}** and therefore
also of its **political relevance**]{.underline}. "[[**Practically
relevant** knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[is]{.mark} therefore [**not
possible** without]{.mark} "meta**[theoretical
reflection]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Reus-Smit 2013, 605), and vice
versa. [Locating the **discipline** of IR within the context of this
relationship between politics and knowledge also **illuminates** the
nature and **function** of some of its **core features**]{.underline}.
It shows that the poverty of its subject matter, its fragmentation, and
its immaturity arise from the ultimate limitation of modern
knowledge---its inability to provide an account of totality---and is
therefore common to all modern sciences. Within this context, however,
[fragmentation does not function as a barrier to scientific
progress]{.underline}. Instead, [it drives it in the form of greater
theoretical pluralism.]{.underline} And **[far]{.underline}** [from
**indicating** an "**end of theory**," the **waxing** and **waning** of
metatheoretical debates results from the **political implications** and
**limitations** of **scientific knowledge**. [These]{.mark}
dynamics]{.underline} of modern scientific development, in turn,
[[carry]{.mark} with them **[political
implications]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite its universalist
aspirations, [modern knowledge is **always partial** and can only
illuminate norms **already embodied** in given practices rather than
**generating** guiding principles for **practice**]{.underline} (Weber
1948, 147). For this reason, [[the role of IR scholars]{.mark}
interested [in]{.mark} improving [politics **cannot be reduced**
to]{.mark} the "**heroic**" one "of [providing
**scientific**]{.mark}**ally derived** [knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
by which foreign policy may be guided," [[but must **fundamentally**
include]{.mark} "the '**ironic'** one of ensuring that **[rival
explanations]{.mark}** can be heard"]{.underline} (Zambernardi 2016,
4--5). [[Theory]{.mark}, in sum, [plays a **pivotal role** for]{.mark}
the constitution, reproduction, and progressive **development** of
[IR]{.mark}]{.underline} as a modern science. What is more, [theory at
**every level** of abstraction plays a **constitutive role** for the
political relevance of modern science in general]{.underline}. And
theory, at every level of abstraction, also plays a directly political
role. [**Theory**, in short, is [both **indispensable** and **highly
practical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, the implications of the
present study apply also to its own findings. By focusing on the common
epistemic basis of the modern sciences and modern politics, I
established connections between politics and knowledge, and between IR
and other disciplines. [This highlights the political relevance of
abstract and concrete, good and bad quality, and accessible and
inaccessible studies]{.underline}. Yet, by focusing on the modern
episteme, this study necessarily abstracts from the ontological
dimension---from the specificities of politics and knowledge, the
differences between IR and other modern sciences, between abstract and
concrete, critical and mainstream, good- and bad-quality work. The
source of the confusion over the relevance of IR, however, has always
lain in the epistemic basis of the relation between modern politics and
the sciences.

#### Epistemology [outweighs]{.underline}\-\--in the context of the [Arctic]{.underline}, it [directly affects]{.underline} policy [implementation]{.underline}.

International Relations, Aalborg University), "Disrupting 'Arctic
Exceptionalism'? A Qualitative Discourse Analysis of the Securitization
of Climate Change in the EU's Arctic Policy,"

njn\]

[The employment of the Arctic as a means to **advance the
securitization** of **climate change** on a global scale
points]{.underline} toward a key aspect in Arctic relations: [[The
Arctic **is**, what **outsiders make it to be**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The Arctic as an area is comprised of parts of the territory of eight
different states, whose decision-makers reside outside the Arctic. [The
concept of Arctic [**exceptionalism** displays]{.mark} a **[similar
construction]{.mark}** of the Arctic from the outside as the EU's
climate change discourse does and centers around the cooperative
relationship]{.underline} between the Arctic states in comparison with
their relationship outside the Arctic. Moreover, [[a **key**]{.mark}
**aspect** of **[critique]{.mark}s** of the concept [of]{.mark} **Arctic
[exceptionalism]{.mark}** [is that it is a **narrow view** of]{.mark}
**inter-state [security]{.mark}** [and **does not account**]{.mark} for
other kinds of **threats** that affect **[local
people]{.mark}**]{.underline} directly. Instead, as already mentioned
when [conceptualizing Arctic exceptionalism, it is [a **selective
discourse**]{.mark} about characteristics of the Arctic [that **enable
cooperation** on the **international level**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The EU employing an exceptionalisation of the Arctic as part of its
efforts for the securitization of climate change differs from the
concept of Arctic exceptionalism. Hence, [the **[construction]{.mark}**
of the Arctic [by **outsiders** depends on]{.mark} their
**[understanding]{.mark}** of the Arctic, [and]{.mark}, more
**importantly**, on [whether]{.mark} a **certain [depiction]{.mark}**
[is **beneficial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Arctic states, [the
**compartmentalization** of Arctic politics and [the **depiction** of
the Arctic as **peaceful** is **essential** to counter **societal** and
**environmental challenges**]{.mark} and pursue **economic**
opportunities. For the EU, the **depiction** of the Arctic as **severely
affected** by **climate change** is **beneficial**, as it serves to
**advance** its aim]{.underline} for action against climate change [on a
**global scale**.]{.underline}

This shows how [[**differences** in the way]{.mark} that the [Arctic is
**constructed** affect]{.mark} **inter-state [relations]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. There are direct discursive effects: firstly, [in
the case of the concept of Arctic exceptionalism, the **upkeep** of
**desecuritized relations**]{.underline}, secondly, [in the case of the
EU's **climate change** discourse, [the **reinforcement** of]{.mark}
climate change as a **[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, [it
serves to [**increase insecurity** in]{.mark} interstate
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the Arctic states, [this takes
place]{.underline} on two levels. On the one hand, [through the
construction of a potential threat]{.underline}, which is contingent on
them accepting the securitizing move. On the other hand, [the
securitizing move is also **aimed** at a **global audience** in the
global sphere, where the Arctic states have **different** amounts of
**influence**]{.underline}. Even if the securitizing move is rejected on
a global level, [[the **transfer** of the Arctic to the global level
**increases insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

3.2 Decolonization of Metadata, Subject Headings, and Description

[**Libraries** and **[archives]{.mark}** in many countries]{.underline},
including UArctic member countries, [[hold]{.mark} **collections** of
[materials]{.mark} by, for, and [about **Indigenous peoples**. The
standards]{.mark}]{.underline} most often [[used to **organize**]{.mark}
and **classify** most of [these]{.mark} collections come from a
**Western tradition** and]{.underline}, therefore, [[reflect a
**colonial**]{.mark} **[worldview]{.mark}**. These standards include
**controlled vocabularies**]{.underline} such as the Library of Congress
Subject Headings (LCSH) and the National Library of Medicine's Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH), [as well as **classification
systems**]{.underline} such as Library of Congress Classification (LCC),
Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), and Universal Decimal Classification
(UDC). Furthermore, [descriptive [**records** are]{.mark} usually
[created in the language of]{.mark} the [**colonial power** rather
than]{.mark} the languages of [**Indigenous peoples**. The result
i]{.mark}s that the **language** used to describe these collections is
often **[incorrect]{.mark}**, culturally **inappropriate**, [or
**derogatory**]{.mark}. The problematic and [**harmful impacts** of
these]{.mark} standards and practices [are **well documented**]{.mark}
and generally acknowledged within the **library** and
**archives**]{.underline} professions (Berman, 1995, 2000; Bosom &
Dunne, 2017; Bullard et al., 2022; Duarte & Belarde-Lewis, 2015; Farnel,
2021; Hoffman, 2022; Littletree & Metoyer, 2015; Olson, 1999; Rigby,
2022; Sandy & Bossaller, 2017).

[Recent movements in many countries [to **acknowledge**]{.mark} and
redress past **[wrongs]{.mark}** have given new urgency in revisiting
and revising problematic standards and practices]{.underline}. As Perera
(2022, pp. 356--357) notes, efforts in this area are known by names such
as "critical cataloguing," "inclusive description," "ethical
description/cataloguing," "radical cataloguing," "conscientious
cataloguing/editing," "reparative description," and "anti-racist
description." When focused specifically on materials by, for, and about
Indigenous peoples, [this work [is]{.mark} often [referred to as
**decolonizing**]{.mark}, aimed at **centering** Indigenous
**terminology**, culture, and knowledge in **descriptive standards** and
practices. **Decolonization** is]{.underline} defined as

> [[the process of **deconstructing**]{.mark} colonial ideologies of the
> **[superiority]{.mark}** and **privilege** [of **Western
> thought**]{.mark} and approaches]{.underline}. It involves
> [**dismantling** structures that **perpetuate** the **status
> quo**]{.underline}, addressing unbalanced power dynamics, valuing,
> [[and **revitalizing** Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} and
> approaches]{.underline}, and weeding out settler biases or assumption.
> (Cull et al., 2018, p. 7)

In the context of resource description, [this work most **commonly**
involves working around **subject headings** and **classification**
numbers assigned to resources]{.underline}. This resource description
often explores the terminology that exists within formal knowledge
organization systems such as LCSH, LCC, or DDC and replacing terminology
with local alternatives and proposing changes such as enhancing
descriptions with keywords, improving content taken from the resources
themselves, adding creator affiliations, or creating descriptions in
local languages. [Within the archival context]{.underline}, where
subject headings and classification are less commonly used, [[efforts
focus on **revising descriptions** to **surface**]{.mark} the
often-unmentioned **[Indigenous voices]{.mark}** and
stories.]{.underline}

[Why is **decolonization** work **necessary** in libraries and
**archives?** A key reason that may seem **obvious**]{.underline} but
deserves repeating [is the **problematic nature** of **language**
itself]{.underline}. As Styres (2019, p. 25) reminds us, ["[language is
**never neutral**]{.mark} -- it can **teach** us, **inform** us,
**entertain** us, **persuade** us, and **manipulate** us]{.underline} --
it can misguide and misdirect truths, thereby [[perpetuating **colonial
myths** and]{.mark} stereotypical
**[representations]{.mark}**]{.underline}." In addition, both Mai (2016)
and Bowker and Star (2000) emphasize that [all classifications are
**arbitrary** and **contextual** and cannot nor should not be applied
**universally**]{.underline}. Certainly, [libraries and [archives
have]{.mark} long [been **complicit** in]{.mark} "perpetuating
**[colonial]{.mark} approaches** to [knowledge by **replacing**]{.mark}
traditional knowledge with **[Western knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
especially in physical libraries established under colonial regimes"
(Burgess, 2015, slide 3).

Further [necessity for change comes from both **moral** and
**professional imperatives**]{.underline}. According to the United
Nations' (2008) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,
[[Indigenous peoples have the **right** to]{.mark} "maintain, protect
and develop the past, present, and future manifestations of [their

use, develop, and transmit to future generations their histories,
languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and
literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for
communities, places, and persons" (Article 13, p. 7). [The ability [to
**access information**]{.mark} in your own **language** [is a
powerful]{.mark} **cultural [affirmation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The archival and library professions are beginning to acknowledge the
biases inherent in standards and practices, calling upon its members for
action. For example, the Cataloging Ethics Steering Committee (2022, p.
2), a joint group formed from members of the Canadian, American, and
British cataloguing communities, notes:

> [Cataloguing **standards** and practices are currently and
> historically characterised by **racism**, **white supremacy**,
> **colonialism**, othering, and **oppression**]{.underline}. We
> recognise that neither cataloguing nor cataloguers are neutral, and we
> endorse critical cataloguing as an approach to our shared work with
> the goal of making metadata inclusive and resources accessible.

In the Canadian context, the Steering Committee on Canada's Archives
(2022, p. 48) reiterates that

> [[**mainstream** archival]{.mark} arrangement and description
> standards and practices are [based on a **Eurocentric**
> worldview]{.mark}. Such standards and practices actively
> **[marginalize]{.mark}** and **[disenfranchise]{.mark}** First

> Inuit, and Métis histories; [and **hinder**]{.mark} meaningful
> [access]{.mark} to **archival materials**]{.underline} by and about

> collections.

This work involves collaborating with Indigenous peoples to revise
standards and practices so that subject headings, descriptive
terminology, and metadata appropriately reflect the worldviews,
languages, and preferences of the Indigenous populations to whom records
are related. Such collaboration requires commitment, resources, and
collective action across and among communities, organizations, and
individuals.

2.3 Justice Between Ethics and Politics

Justice requires continually renegotiating the relationship between
ethics and politics, singular and universal, precisely because there is
always something in excess, something beyond recognition. This remainder
is the ethical imperative that should keep us awake at night. Rather
than lead to inquietude or apathy, the excess beyond our recognition
keeps us actively searching for better ways to approach justice without
resting on moral rules or risk-benefit calculations or self-righteous
principles. The remainder beyond calculation, beyond recognition,
demands that we continue to question our own principles and policies,
that we continue to examine our concepts of justice and fairness and
equality.

An ethical politics is one in which justice demands the hyper-vigilance
self-critical reflection on where any response---ethical or
political---necessarily falls short. It is an ongoing task that cannot
end with risk-benefit analysis. Despite the ethical insomnia and
political vertigo caused by this interminable self-questioning, we must
act---even leap. Although ultimately the gap between singularity and
universality is impassible, the impossibility of achieving justice is no
excuse for not attempting it every single day.

This tension between politics (which addresses itself to what can be
seen, and to the universal, what can be shared), and ethics (which
addressed itself to what cannot be seen, and to the singular, what
cannot be shared) is the knot at the center of justice.

[[Justice is **antithetical** to **util**]{.mark}itarian ethics [insofar
as **individuals** are **not fungible units** that can be **exchanged**.
**Util**]{.mark}itarianism [relies on]{.mark} the [**calculability** of
pain]{.mark}, suffering, survival, or the quality of life itself.
[And]{.mark}]{.underline} the utilitarian calculus relies on
[[determining]{.mark} thresholds that separate individuals into
groups]{.underline}, whether it is those who are members of the moral
community or the polis, and those who are not (for example animals), [or
those [whose **lives** are **worth saving** and]{.mark} those
[whose]{.mark} lives [are **not**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At some point, however, [this type of **line-drawing** inevitably
becomes either **political** or **arbitrary**]{.underline}. Take debates
over the basis for membership in the moral community. What are the
criteria for membership? Intelligence, language, reason, sentience, the
ability to suffer? And whatever we decide should be the criteria, where
do we draw the line? For example, what counts as a language? Does the
bees signal dance count? Or, as some argue, is it merely a code and not
a language? What counts as intelligence? Peter Singer argues that great
apes should be extended rights or admitted to the moral community based
on their intelligence, which is greater than severely mentally disabled
persons (see Singer, 1999; McMahan, 2009; Anstötz, 1993).Footnote 11
Some disability scholars such as Eva Kittay have argued against this
comparison, insisting that human beings should be accorded special
status regardless of their mental abilities (Kittay, 1998a, b,
2009).Footnote 12 The controversy over Singer's argument demonstrates
how [utilitarian **line-drawing** is always a **fraught endeavor** that
ultimately rests on an **arbitrary cut off** point.]{.underline}

For example, in Animal Liberation, Singer draws the line between calms
and shellfish, who supposedly cannot feel pain (Singer, 1990,
173--4).Footnote 13 But what if we learn that shellfish can feel pain?
[In all these utilitarian endeavors, the **liminal cases** are
**unsettling** because they **reveal** the **arbitrariness** of borders
and the **inadequacy** of general **classifications**. This type of
line-drawing or threshold not only **ignores the singularity** of each
individual, but also poses an **arbitrary** or **political** dividing
line as a **natural border**]{.underline}. [The same is true of
**national borders** used to **keep migrants out**.]{.underline}

We see something similar in covid triage medicine where triage protocols
disadvantage whole classes of people. Old people, disabled people,
cancer survivors. The coronavirus lays bare the fantasy of calculable
criteria as an ethical way of life. Covid reveals gaping inequities in
the length and quality of life caused by social and economic
"pre-existing conditions." Celebrities and politicians from Madonna to
Andrew Cuomo called the coronavirus the "great equalizer." In March
2020, Cuomo tweeted "This virus is the great equalizer." In reality,
covid is the great unequalizer... Footnote 14

The pandemic forces doctors and nurses to make impossible decisions
about who is given the chance to live and who will die. But these
decisions exist in the context of pre-existing conditions of poverty,
racism, and unequal access to health care that skew any attempt at fair
or reasonable calculation. In a fair and just world, there would be
adequate resources available to everyone. Tragically, the real world is
not so fair or just. And [risk-benefit analysis and calculative
reasoning become the justification for allowing some to die.
[When]{.mark}]{.underline} those [**[calculations]{.mark}** pose as
justice or fairness, and when they [allow us to **feel
certain**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even righteous, in our decisions, [then
[they risk a **slippery slope**]{.mark} that leads us to a place
[where]{.mark} any and [**all life** can become
**disposable**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The pandemic has made painfully clear the limitations of risk-benefit
analysis and calculative reasoning. Doctors and nurses report being
traumatized when forced to decide who will get life saving resources.
Face-to-face with patients, risk-benefit calculations are not as
straight forward as the mathematical or statistical modelling suggests.

A group of research physicians at the University of California,
describes the problem:

Utilitarian approaches to ethical problems often appear to be more
practical than many alternatives: we can know what the right course of
action is by calculating whichever choice will produce the greatest good
for the greatest number. [Part of the appeal of utilitarian ethics is
that it seems like it should "work."]{.underline} In the real world,
however, [performing the **relevant calculations** can be far from
easy]{.underline}. This is especially true in crisis situations. [[It
may be **impossible** to **collect**]{.mark} the [data]{.mark} needed as
input for the calculations, it may be difficult or **impossible** to
create the **decision rules**]{.underline} (predicting prognosis or
comparing outcomes) [that constitute the calculations, [the
**calculator** may be **impaired**]{.mark} by any number of different
factors]{.underline} (moral distress, fatigue, internal and external
pressures, etc.) [[or **non-util**]{.mark}itarian moral
[constraints]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as superseding egalitarian
policies, or even exponentially increasing crisis severity) [can [make
**util**]{.mark}itarian approaches **[infeasible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
(Fedyk et al., 2020)Footnote 15

2.4 The "Lessor of Evils"

Rather than an ethical solution, utilitarian risk-benefit analysis in a
triage medicine is a "lesser of the evils" approach. In fact, as I
discovered doing research for Carceral Humanitarianism, when discussing
both humanitarian aid and warfare, experts described risk-benefit and
collateral damage calculations as the "lessor of the evils" (Oliver,
2017). Some even see these policies of assessing collateral damage as
preventing the worst evil by preventing massacre, genocide, and mass
death. But as Hannah Arendt reminds us, "Those who choose the lesser
evil forget very quickly that they still chose evil" (Arendt, 2003,
30).Footnote 16

In Carceral Humanitarianism, I consider the question of "the worst"
violence. There, I argue that contemporary logics of proportionality
employed by both humanitarian aid organization and humanitarian military
operations are designed to mitigate and control violence and death to
avoid the worst violence and death, according to calculations of the
"lessor of evils." Thus, we must ask what is the "most evil," or [[the
**worst evil**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We may think of genocide as the
**worst evil**]{.underline}, and, in the West, "the worst" is often
shorthand for the "final solution" and the Holocaust. Since the end of
World War II, and the Cold War, ["the worst" [has become **associated**
with]{.mark} the possibility of nuclear war, even [the **destruction**
of the **entire planet**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[What if [the worst is]{.mark} a result of [the **logic of calculation**
taken to the **extreme** at the **expense** of **all other**]{.mark}
worldviews?]{.underline} What if the worst is when [[this]{.mark}
calculable way of thinking [is used to justify **massacre**,
**genocide**, and **mass death**]{.mark}? When lives become
**fungible**]{.underline} and exchange, then [we risk "**the
worst**."]{.underline} Insofar as contemporary so-called "humanitarian"
warfare operates according to the logic of utilitarian calculations of
collateral damage that make some lives disposable, it too risks "the
worst."

[[The worst goes **beyond literal killing** and signals the
**erasure**]{.mark} a way [of]{.mark} seeing the
world]{.underline}---[or we might as well say [a **world
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[by **covering** it over with another
worldview]{.underline}. In this regard, [[**comparative** models that
**reduce life** to **units**]{.mark} to be exchanged or plugged into
equations [**operate** according to a]{.mark} **world-destroying
[genocidal logic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is to say, when "the
worst" becomes part of the economy of "lessor of evils," life and death
are reduced to a logic of calculation that makes them fungible; one life
is weighed against another. Which is the lesser evil: One thousand four
hundred and twenty-two refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea in
2020 or the cost to citizens of the European Union of providing safe
passage to refugees? Which is the lesser evil: killing one civilian
infant or killing three soldiers in a surgical strike? Which is the
lessor evil: a 50-year-old diabetic and mother of two with covid dying
because she doesn't have access to a ventilator, or a widowed and
otherwise healthy 70-year-old man dying without access to a ventilator?
Etc. Etc.

What is an acceptable death? The death as collateral damage? To be
calculable, each life must be reducible to a common denominator and
exchangeable. Each life becomes a unit in an equation, a risk factor.

Yet, as the examples I just mentioned suggest, these decisions as to
which is worse---or which is the lesser of the evils---are always made
by privileging one context over another. Citizenship over foreign
nations. Civilians over military. Diabetes over motherhood. How do we
weigh one life against another? How do we decide whose life is worth
more? Whose life is worth more and whose life is expendable as
collateral damage? Which factors are deemed relevant, and which are not?
Which goals are deemed worthy, and which are not? Ultimately,
utilitarian calculus cannot give us the answers to these questions.

## Perms

### Perm\-\--AT: Do the Alt\-\--2NC

#### Perm "Do the alt" is [illegitimate]{.underline}.

#### 1. De-securitization is [mutually exclusive]{.underline} with voting AFF. The 1AC engaged in [securitizing]{.underline} rhetoric, and our [criticism]{.underline} of that is [legitimate]{.underline}. Don't let them [walk back]{.underline} on security claims [they made]{.underline}.

#### 2. The alt can [solve]{.underline} their impacts [without]{.underline} the plan. If we win that [securitization]{.underline} makes it [impossible]{.underline} to solve threats, then [rejecting]{.underline} security is the [first step]{.underline} in solving [every]{.underline} impact.

### Perm\-\--AT: Do Both\-\--2NC

#### Perm "Do both" is [impossible]{.underline}.

#### 1. Framework comes [first]{.underline}\-\--if we win that they [can't weigh]{.underline} the [plan]{.underline}, they can't weigh any [perm]{.underline} that [includes]{.underline} the plan either.

#### 2. The perm [severs]{.underline} the 1AC's [representations]{.underline} by abandoning its securitizing rhetoric. That's [illegitimate]{.underline} because it allows affirmative teams to make [unethical claims]{.underline} in the 1AC and receive a "get out of jail free" card by [advocating]{.underline} for being ethical [later]{.underline}.

#### 3. [Every link]{.underline} argument is a [disadvantage]{.underline} to the permutation. If the perm [includes]{.underline} the [rhetoric]{.underline} of the 1AC, it [legitimizes]{.underline} it, which means it's [incapable]{.underline} of [rejecting security]{.underline} rhetoric in the Arctic. That's creates the [illusion]{.underline} of a rejection of [securitization]{.underline} while [maintaining]{.underline} it, which is [worse]{.underline} because it [disempowers]{.underline} active resistance.

#### 4. Ideological competition is [good]{.underline}: It forces the AFF to defend the [ethicality]{.underline} of their assumptions, and it's [predictable]{.underline} because the [AFF chooses]{.underline} which [assumptions]{.underline} they include in the [1AC]{.underline}.

### Perm\-\--Authoritarianism Turn\-\--2NC

**Neocleous 8** \[Mark Neocleous (Professor, Critique of Political
Economy, Brunel University, London; Editor, Radical Philosophy journal;
Ph.D. in Philosophy, Middlesex University London), 2008, "Critique of
Security," Edinburgh University Press, njn\]

[[The only way **out**]{.mark} of such a dilemma]{.underline}, to escape
the fetish, [[is]{.mark} perhaps [to **eschew**]{.mark} the logic of
**[security altogether]{.mark}**]{.underline} - [to reject it as so
**ideologically loaded** in favour of the **state** that [any]{.mark}
real [**political thought** other than the **authoritarian**]{.mark} and
**reactionary** [should]{.mark} be pressed to **[give it
up]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That is clearly something that can not be
achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus could never
even begin to be imagined by the security intellectual]{.underline}. It
is also something that the constant iteration of refrain the \'this is
an insecure world\' and reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity
after another will also make it hard to do. [But it is something that
the critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a
political way out of the impasse of security.]{.underline}

This impasse exists because [[security]{.mark} has now become so
**all-encompassing** that it [**marginalises** all else, most
notably]{.mark} the **[constructive]{.mark}** conflicts,
**[debates]{.mark}** and discussions [that animate **political
life**]{.mark}. The **constant prioritising** of a mythical
**security**]{.underline} as a political end - as the political end
[constitutes a **rejection of politics** in any meaningful sense of the
term]{.underline}. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can
be articulated, in which the conflicts and struggles that arise from
such differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which people might
come to believe that another world is possible - that they might
transform the world and in turn be transformed. [Security
politics]{.underline} simply removes this; worse, it remoeves it while
purportedly addressing it. In so doing it [**suppresses** all issues of
**power** and turns political questions into debates about the **most
efficient** way to achieve \'security\']{.underline}, despite the fact
that we are never quite told - never could be told - what might count as
having achieved it. [Security politics is]{.underline}, in this sense,
an anti-politics,\"\' [**[dominating]{.mark}** political
**[discourse]{.mark}** in much [the same manner as the **security
state** tries to **dominate human beings**]{.mark}]{.underline},
reinforcing security fetishism and the monopolistic character of
security on the political imagination. [We]{.underline} therefore [need
to get **beyond security politics**, not add yet more \'sectors\' to it
in]{.underline} a way that simply expands the scope of the state and
legitimises state intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives.

Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams,
co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the
latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole
that\'s left behind? But I\'m inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there
is no hole.\"\' The mistake has been to think that there is a hole and
that this hole needs to be filled with a new vision or revision of
security in which it is re-mapped or civilised or gendered or humanised
or expanded or whatever. All of these ultimately remain within the
statist political imaginary, and consequently end up reaffirming the
state as the terrain of modern politics, the grounds of security. The
real task is not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of
security, but to fight for an alternative political language which takes
us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore
does not constantly throw us into the arms of the state. That\'s the
point of critical politics: to develop a new political language more
adequate to the kind of society we want. Thus while much of what I have
said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of
critical theory is that the negative may be as significant as the
positive in setting thought on new paths.

[For if security really is the **supreme concept** of **bourgeois
society**]{.underline} and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, [then
to keep **harping** on about **insecurity** and [to keep
demanding]{.mark} \'more [security]{.mark}\']{.underline} (while meekly
hoping that this increased security doesn\'t damage our liberty) [[is to
**blind** ourselves to]{.mark} the possibility of building **[real
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the authoritarian tendencies in
contemporary politics. [To situate ourselves against security politics
would allow us to **circumvent** the **debilitating effect** achieved
through the **constant securitising**]{.underline} of social and
political issues, debilitating in the sense that \'security\' helps
consolidate the power of the existing forms of social domination and
justifies the short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. It
would also allow us to forge another kind of politics centred on a
different conception of the good[. [We need a **new way** of
**thinking**]{.mark} and **talking** about social being and politics
that moves us **[beyond security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This would
perhaps be **emancipatory** in the true sense of the word]{.underline}.
What this might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But
[[it]{.mark} certainly [requires recognising that **security** is an
**illusion**]{.mark} that has **forgotten it is an
illusion**]{.underline}; it requires recognising that [security is **not
the same** as **solidarity**]{.underline}; it requires accepting that
[insecurity is part of the **human condition**]{.underline}, and thus
[[**giving up the search** for]{.mark} the [certainty of
security]{.mark} and instead learning to **tolerate** the
**uncertainties**]{.underline}, ambiguities and \'insecurities\' that
come with being human; it requires accepting that \'securitizing\' an
issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out
and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to return
the gift.\"\'

Moving security into '[normal politics]{.underline}' is a form of preemptive [de-securitization]{.underline} that disrupts [security rhetoric]{.underline} before it [collapses]{.underline} the Arctic into a region of [infinite competition]{.underline} and war.

Exploring Legal Personhood for the Arctic Ocean

In recent years, there has been growing momentum towards recognizing
natural entities as legal subjects. Examples include the Whanganui River
in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Birrarung River in Australia,4) the Mar
Menor lagoon in Spain,5) and even "nature" itself in Ecuador.6)
Recently, a notable development occurred in Linhares, Brazil, where
waves at the mouth of the Doce River and its connected bodies of water
were granted legal personhood,7) making the first recognition of oceanic
rights. These legal initiatives reflect the attempt to shift global
consciousness regarding environmental protection and frameworks from an
anthropocentric worldview, where nature is seen as a resource to be
exploited, to one that acknowledges the intrinsic rights and moral value
of more-than-human entities.

Against this backdrop, and as an exercise of legal imagination8) it is
useful to imagine the Arctic Ocean as an actor of law rather than an
object. Could granting legal personhood to the Arctic Ocean redefine the
human-ocean relationship? Drawing on initiatives such as the Universal
Declaration of Ocean Rights (UDOR), we might envision the Arctic Ocean
as a rights-holder, with the right to health, to flourish, to be free of
pollution, to be restored, and to not be overfished. In practice, there
are challenges from the interplay of existing frameworks, rooted in
state modes of existence, such as UNCLOS, the Central Arctic Ocean
Fisheries Agreement, and the BBNJ Agreement, reflects state-centrism and
a geography of sovereignty that imposes rigid spatial boundaries on the
fluid and interconnected nature of the Arctic Ocean. Beyond these
challenges, the deeper question remains: can granting rights to the
Arctic Ocean truly shift how humans relate to and interact with the
environment?

While granting legal rights to natural entities is progressive as it
changes who/what is the subject of law, its effectiveness depends on a
deeper shift in values, power dynamics, and forms of governance (the
author acknowledges that even the word "governance" points towards
dualism and subject/object relationships). Critics argue that "rights"
remain a product of Western legal traditions.9) As such, extending
rights to natural entities risks reinforcing human authority over nature
by confining the ocean within Western legal categories10) and
perpetuating the same legal structures that have historically treated
nature as a resource to be managed, regulated, and exploited for human
benefit.11) While granting legal personhood to the Arctic Ocean could
create an illusion of empowerment, these approaches may commodify or
regulate natural entities within a system that views legal personhood as
an extension of human authority, thereby maintaining the underlying
dominion-based relationship intact and keeping the Arctic Ocean within a
paradigm where humans are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of what is
best for the natural world. Rights, in general, remain subject to human
interpretation, shaped by competing economic, political, or cultural
interests, which may still prioritize human welfare over the ocean's
health and inherent value. Therefore, unless there is a significant
shift in the current and prevailing paradigm, rights of nature applied
to the Arctic Ocean risk being subsumed within the very framework they
aim to reform.12)

Beyond Legal Personhood: A Shift Towards Relational Approaches

[Addressing the **Arctic**'s escalating socio-ecological crises requires
**rethinking** our normative **relationship** with the ocean at its
**core**]{.underline}. A [[radical **departure** from]{.mark} the
**entrenched** structures of traditional [Western]{.mark} tools informed
by [**state-centrism** is necessary, moving]{.mark} instead [toward a
**relational** approach]{.mark}]{.underline} rooted in care,
reciprocity, and mutual enhancement. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} shift
[[**envisions** the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [not as]{.mark} a
**[passive]{.mark} object** of regulation [but as an **active
agent**]{.mark} in shaping this relationship]{.underline}. Drawing from
Indigenous knowledge, relationality scholarships, ethics of care and the
profound interdependencies with these fragile ecosystems, this article
suggests a relational model that challenges the Western legal tradition.

[In many Indigenous worldviews, [the **ocean**]{.mark}]{.underline},
among other natural entities, [[is]{.mark} viewed **[not]{.mark} as
[separate]{.mark}** from human life [but]{.mark} as
**[kin]{.mark}**]{.underline} or sacred beings [that **coexist** in
balance]{.underline} with human life. For instance, [the Arctic Ocean
forms the **essence** of Inuit **identity** and
livelihoods]{.underline}, deeply woven into the fabric of their way of
knowing and being.13) [It is [**central** to]{.mark} their existence,
[cultural **identity**]{.mark} as a people, economic **stability**, and
social **well-being**]{.underline} in all its forms, from liquid to
frozen.14) In this context, [embracing relationality becomes a shared
collective responsibility]{.underline} to care for the ocean's health
and flourishing, [which **cannot be separated** from the flourishing of
the human and the **more-than-human** communities that **depend** on
it.]{.underline}

[[A **relational ethic** that resists]{.mark} the **[binary]{.mark}**

[relational ethics **move away** from the state's all-encompassing
**sovereignty**]{.mark}, embracing **diverse actors**, including
Indigenous peoples, and]{.underline} even
[[conceptualizing]{.underline}]{.mark} nature, including [[the
ocean]{.underline}]{.mark} itself, [[as]{.mark} an **[active]{.mark}
participant**]{.underline}.16) One notable example of relational legal
framework is Aotearoa New Zealand's recognition of the Whanganui River
as a legal person under the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims
Settlement) Act 2017.17) This model goes beyond conventional Western
legal paradigms by incorporating Māori perspectives, which view the
river as an ancestor (tupuna) and emphasize its intrinsic value as part
of a living system. The Act established the Whanganui River as a legal
person, with its interests represented by a guardian (Te Pou Tupua)
composed of two people acting as one single entity: one appointed by the
Whanganui iwi (tribes/people) and one by the Crown. While this
guardianship model provides an innovative step toward relational laws,
it still operates within the constraints of human oversight and
interpretation. The guardians act as intermediaries between the river
and human society, upholding the river's intrinsic values, safeguarding
its ecological integrity, preserving its biodiversity, protecting its
cultural heritage, and ensuring its overall health and well-being.
However, while inspired by Indigenous relationality, such a model
remains rooted in Western anthropocentric legal traditions that frame
nature through human categories of rights and representation.

In this context, [a **guardianship** framework tailored to the Arctic
could offer a **practical avenue** for implementing **relationality**,
with **representatives** from Arctic Indigenous peoples and
communities]{.underline}, and state or regional authorities
[**co-caring** for the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. However, for this
model to truly reflects relational values it would need to avoid the
pitfalls of conventional legal personhood by emphasizing care,
reciprocity and the ocean's agency, thereby recognizing the ocean not as
a passive entity to be managed but as a dynamic, self-regulating force
with a distinct voice in representative frameworks. [The Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}, envisioned as a co-creator in the interdependent
relationships that sustain life, [would take an **active role** in its
own care, rather than being subject to **dominion-based** paradigms.
Drawing on **Indigenous worldviews** that already view the ocean as
**kin**]{.underline} or a sacred entity, [this expanded relational legal

**transcends utilitarianism**]{.underline}, emphasizing mutual respect,
care, and enhancement. Such an approach also addresses the Arctic's
unique challenges by respecting its interwoven ecological, social, and
cultural dimensions. Furthermore, [it situates the Arctic Ocean as an
**integral part** of a broader ecosystem where all
beings]{.underline}---human and more-than-human---[**collaboratively**
shape a shared future. This inclusive perspective honors **non-Western**
worldviews and **ways of being**, affirming the rights of all beings to
**coexist** harmoniously]{.underline}.

[[A **relational**]{.mark} legal [model emphasizes]{.mark} the dynamic,
**[interconnected]{.mark}**, and inclusive [nature of]{.mark}

Connectivity reflects the deep interdependence between human and
more-than-human entities in the Arctic, recognizing that the health and
well-being of these systems are inseparable. [[Relational laws]{.mark}
also [promote]{.mark} **inclusivity**, ensuring that **[diverse]{.mark}
voices** and [knowledge systems]{.mark}, particularly those of
Indigenous peoples, are [**woven** into **governance**]{.mark}
structures]{.underline}, respecting the unique relationships that local
communities have with their environments. By honoring place-based
knowledge of Arctic Indigenous peoples, relational laws bridge the gap
between Western legal frameworks and Indigenous relational ethics,
fostering a normative relationship that is deeply rooted in local
contexts. In doing so, [they **reject universalizing** practices that
**flatten** the richness of specific places and natural
systems]{.underline}. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's notion of the "danger
of a single story" underscores the importance of embracing diverse
perspectives and experiences to avoid harmful simplifications and
distorted understanding of reality.19)

In addition, [a **shift** toward [relational models]{.mark}]{.underline}
extends beyond legal frameworks; it also [[require]{.mark}s
**[cultivating]{.mark}** emotional and cultural **[connections]{.mark}**
with the ocean]{.underline}. Empathy, compassion, and responsibility
become the drivers of environmental caretaking, encouraging deeper and
lasting behavioral changes. [Recognizing our emotional and moral
responsibility to care for the Arctic Ocean fosters a **collective
commitment**]{.underline} to protecting it that challenges the status
quo.

Conclusion: Envisioning a Relational Community of Care

Rethinking the normative relationship with the Arctic Ocean calls for a
transformative vision of the region as a space of shared care, where
humans and the more-than-human collaborate to preserve their common
home. This vision aligns with the concept of "community of care," as
articulated by Emily Murray and Margherita Poto,20) which emphasizes
mutual learning between humans and the ocean, and fosters caring as a
shared responsibility. [Such a vision requires humankind to think with
the ocean, **not merely** about it as a **resource**, but as an **active
participant** in co-shaping its/our future.]{.underline}

It calls for relational and reciprocal legal models that acknowledges
the interconnectedness of human and more-than-human worlds and
recognizes the diverse experiences of the Arctic Ocean. It underscores
that there is no single story of the Arctic Ocean, but a multitude of
Arctic experiences, each shaped by local histories, ecologies, and
communities. [[A **key step**]{.mark} in this transformation [is
**devolving** authority to **communities** and]{.mark} fostering
[**place-based** laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. By centering the voices and
knowledge of those most connected to the Arctic, including Indigenous
peoples and local communities, we can move toward legal systems that are
as diverse and dynamic as the ecosystems they aim to protect.
[[This]{.mark} **localized** approach [ensures]{.mark} that [laws
reflect]{.mark} the [**unique** characteristics]{.mark} and needs of
each Arctic context, [rather than imposing **homogenizing
frameworks**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While the rights offer a meaningful starting point by acknowledging the
intrinsic value of natural entities, they remain grounded in Western
legal paradigms that risk reinforcing human authority over nature. It is
unsure whether they are sufficient to pave the way for a legal model
that transcends state-dominated structures. These rights could serve as
a transitional tool in this journey towards a deeper transformation that
prioritizes relational and reciprocal ethics and systems over rigid
legal mechanisms. A relational and inclusive model unlocks new pathways
for the future of the Arctic Ocean. Rooted in respect, reciprocity, and
care for the ocean and for each other. By cultivating a community of
care, we honor the Arctic Ocean as an integral part of the web of life,
ensuring its health and well-being alongside the flourishing of human
and more-than-human communities.

Added-value of scenario analysis for IR scholarship

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order to fill the gap between
IR theory and real-world problems, "an increasing number of scholars
have come to embrace a spirit of intellectual openness, recognizing both
the need for greater flexibility in the theoretical formulations and the
possibility of complementarity by other theories and approaches" (p.
12). This section discusses the added value of scenario analysis as a
complementary approach to traditional IR methods. The most obvious
advantage of scenario analysis as a methodology, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, lies by definition in its ability to
tackle future events. As mentioned before, there are no specified
instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow scholars to
go beyond past and present. The only exception is forecasting, one of
the formal methods in IR, which is, however, distinctly different from
foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, scenario analysis offers more
than the possibility to talk about the future. We see a fourfold merit
of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods applied by IR
scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of explorative
scenarios, which are the subject of this paper, is to stimulate creative
thinking by challenging the deeply held assumptions of their authors. In
other words, this method is helpful for overcoming enduring cognitive
biases---mental errors such as linearity, presentism, and group think
caused by the subconscious and simplified information processing of
humans (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). Humans have the tendencies to focus
on the present at the expense of the future and to think about the
future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into the future. As
Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias our historical and our
theoretical analyses too much toward continuity (...) we rarely find a
way to introduce discontinuities into theory, or to attempt to determine
what causes them to happen" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). Scenario analysis attends to "deeper,
otherwise left implicit, assumptions about continuous and linear
patterns of development" (Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The process
of scenario development invites the participants to reveal and question
convictions which have so far remained unchallenged, and to question the
linearity of world developments.

The ability of reexamining one's own assumptions and going beyond linear
patterns of development is essential for IR scholarship. To illustrate
it with two examples: IR scholars and historians did not think that the
Soviet Union could collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful
resolution of the Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system
(Davis, 2005; Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars
were for decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and
cultural limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden
ascent and were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, &
Peterson, 2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident,
the United States debate on its future has been marked by a similar
linearity of thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's
long-term future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved
incapable of anticipating events of such importance, because scholars
took for granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias
towards linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a
result, two major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and
the rise of China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to
catch up.

Against this backdrop, foresight helps IR scholars to exit the tunnel
vision on world affairs and discover potentially valuable nonlinear
lines of development. These can be both innovative in terms of
scholarship, and policy-relevant by offering a reflection on unexpected
discontinuities. Thus, it can facilitate the intellectual capability to
think the unthinkable (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

Scenario analysis starts with confronting one's enduring assumptions and
developing multiple causal possibilities, through which scholars can
potentially discover topics that have not been examined before. One of
the greatest challenges for any scholar is to identify innovative venues
for research that might bring the discipline forward and advance
publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian terms, such an ability is often
considered an evidence of a progressive research program.10 Since the
prime feature of scenario analysis is to detect rapid and significant
shifts in trajectories, or the forces behind them, this method succors
when defining new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as
mentioned in the previous section, scenario analysis enables the
detection of both weak signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to
these hitherto overlooked but potentially pressing issues, scenario
analysis can identify research agendas for further investigation (Barma
et al., 2016). Therefore, scenario analysis seems to be the right tool
to advance innovative research since it helps scholars drive their
research into new areas, away from moribund topics that have been
followed for many decades. By "identifying questions of likely future
significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6), scenario analysis can
contribute to combatting the proliferation of researchers in fields
occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet or Japan studies in
the United States in the 1980s. At the same time, innovative research
topics confront the uncertainties that are crucial for policymakers to
be monitored closely.

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide comprehensive causal reasoning and thus to tackle
complex issues. As mentioned in the introduction, the world's complexity
combined with abrupt shifts poses a challenge for IR scholarship. The
possibility to accommodate multiple driving forces, to take into account
different values they might take and finally to combine them with each
other and see how they affect the dependent variable, makes the scenario
approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work with a limited number
of independent variables, formulate and test hypotheses usually based on
the relation between a single causal variable and the dependent
variable. Investigating complex causal trajectories is therefore not
possible. Against this background, we agree with Barma et al. (2016) and
his colleagues who argue that scenarios are highly apt for dealing with
complexity and uncertainty and providing academia with a tool for
"actionable clarity in understanding contemporary global issues" (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it. This
distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In security studies, for example, scenario analysis can connect
the dots between hard, soft, traditional and non-traditional
understandings of security and capture the interplay of
economic-societalenvironmental and technological changes. Imposing
interdisciplinarity also helps to counter the "hyper-fragmentation of
knowledge" that "makes it difficult for even scholars in different
disciplines to understand each other, much less policy-makers and
general public" (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

Complex real-world issues that were tackled using scenario analysis
include the Israel-Palestine conflict (Stein et al., 1998), Turkey's
geopolitical environment (Çelik & Blum, 2007), the prospects of the
United States-- China conflict (Friedberg, 2005) and the consequences of
Brexit for EU foreign and security policy (Martill & Sus, 2018). An
examination of these topics without the application of interdisciplinary
approaches would not be possible precisely due to their multifaceted
character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, scenario analysis also enables IR scholars to establish a
channel of communication with policy-makers other than conducting
interviews for their own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. A
participatory scenario process forges "deep and shared understanding
between its participants" (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures. Hence, scenario
analysis can be perceived as a tool towards more exchange between
academia and policy-making that can contribute to a better understanding
between the two worlds. For policymakers, it provides the opportunity to
consider long-term trends (an occasion not often found in the day-to-day
nature of politics). For academics, it provides insight into which
trends are most concerning for policy-makers, allowing them to check and
ultimately enhance the relevance of their research agendas.

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the policy dialogue benefits from scenarios' accessibility to
a broader audience. Scenario publications tend to be shorter and easier
to read than the average academic publication and as Nye (2008) rightly
notes "a premium on time is a major difference between the two cultures"
of academia and policy-making. Since scenario publications are more
suitable to the time- and attention-constraints of many policy-makers,
they improve the accessibility of research findings for the policy world
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of scenario
analysis for IR scholarship are interrelated and that their boundaries
are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they highlight distinct benefits of
this approach for academics that want to tackle the challenges of
today's world via their research.

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of
a nuclear war that kills 99% of the population would eventually be able
to recover civilisation without long-term effect. As we have seen, this
may not be a safe assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought
experiment, the point stands. [What makes [existential
catastrophes]{.mark} **especially bad** is that they would "**[destroy
the future]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick
Bostrom, puts it.66 [[This]{.mark} future [could]{.mark} potentially be
extremely long and full of flourishing, and would therefore [have
**extremely large** value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In standard risk
analysis, when working out how to respond to risk, we work out the
expected value of risk reduction, by weighing the probability that an
action will prevent an adverse event against the severity of the event.
[[Because the value of preventing **existential catastrophe** is so
**vast**]{.mark}, even [a **tiny probability** of prevention has
**huge**]{.mark} expected [value]{.mark}]{.underline}.67 Of course,
there is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a
number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would
be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. In
some areas, government policy does give significant weight to future
generations. For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste
storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds
of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for this policy
usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity according to
which future generations ought to get as much protection as current
generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 However, [when it comes to **existential
risk**]{.underline}, it would seem that [we **fail** to live up to
principles of **intergenerational equity**]{.underline}. [[Existential
**catastrophe** would]{.mark} not only [give **future
generations**]{.mark} less than the current generations; it would give
them **[nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [reducing existential
risk plausibly has a quite **low cost** for us in comparison with the
**huge expected value**]{.underline} it has for future generations. In
spite of this, [relatively **little** is done to **reduce** existential
**risk**]{.underline}. Unless we give up on norms of intergenerational
equity, they give us a strong case for significantly increasing our
efforts to reduce existential risks. 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY In spite of the importance of existential risk reduction, it
probably receives less attention than is warranted. As a result,
concerted international cooperation is required if we are to receive
adequate protection from existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks
are likely to be underinvested in There are several reasons why
existential risk reduction is likely to be underinvested in. Firstly, it
is a global public good. Economic theory predicts that such goods tend
to be underprovided. The benefits of existential risk reduction are
widely and indivisibly dispersed around the globe from the countries
responsible for taking action. Consequently, a country which reduces
existential risk gains only a small portion of the benefits but bears
the full brunt of the costs. Countries thus have strong incentives to
free ride, receiving the benefits of risk reduction without
contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common interest.
Secondly, as already suggested above, existential risk reduction is an
intergenerational public good: most of the benefits are enjoyed by
future generations who have no say in the political process. For these
goods, the problem is temporal free riding: the current generation
enjoys the benefits of inaction while future generations bear the costs.
Thirdly, many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a
satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few existing
governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is
unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available. [**[Cognitive
biases]{.mark}** also [lead people to **underestimate** existential
risks]{.mark}. Since there have not been any catastrophes of this
magnitude, [these risks are **not salient**]{.mark} to politicians and
the public]{.underline}.72 [This is an example of the **misapplication**
of the **availability heuristic**]{.underline}, a mental shortcut which
assumes that something is important only if it can be readily recalled.
[[Another]{.mark} cognitive [bias]{.mark} affecting perceptions of
existential risk [is **scope neglect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a
seminal 1992 study, three groups were asked how much they would be
willing to pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in
uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88,
respectively.73 In this case, the size of the benefits had little effect
on the scale of the preferred response. [[People become **numbed**
to]{.mark} the effect of [**saving lives** when the numbers get **too
large**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 74 [Scope neglect is a particularly acute
problem for existential risk because the numbers at stake are so
large]{.underline}. Due to scope neglect, [decision-makers are prone to
treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which are less
severe by many orders of magnitude]{.underline}. A wide range of other
cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of existential
risks.75

**[Rwanda]{.mark}**, **[Syria]{.mark}**, and elsewhere]{.underline}.9
[[US administrations **did not act**]{.mark} in crises in the **Great
Lakes** region of **Africa** and two major examples of **Russian
aggression** in **Georgia** and **Ukraine**]{.underline}.10 An infamous
case of non-intervention was [the Darfur tragedy in the
**Sudan**]{.underline}, when credible accusations of genocide did not
prompt US action.11 The United States [would **never have invaded**
either **Afghanistan** or **Iraq** had it not been for

Clarke and others [begged two **administrations** to **strike al-Qaeda**

speaking, [the [**selectivity** of US action]{.mark}]{.underline},
rather than a general impulse to intervene, [[is the **dominant**
lesson]{.underline}]{.mark}.13

[[Even with]{.mark} regard to **[Vietnam]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [two US

aggression and protect his personal reputation, but he [[was **hardly

**conflicted** about the war [and **deeply regretted**]{.mark} having to

[been]{.mark} **reactive** and **[halfhearted]{.mark}**]{.underline}
rather than aggressively ambitious. In fact, the alleged epicenter of US

should husband their power for major wars. The two leading modern
conceptual articulations of criteria for going to war---the Weinberger
and Powell Doctrines---came from senior defense officials, and both
represented efforts to constrain, not liberate, the use of force.15
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told a graduating class at West
Point that "[any future **defense secretary** who **advises** the
president to again **send a big American land army**]{.underline} into
Asia or into the Middle East or Africa [should 'have his **head
examined**]{.underline},' as General MacArthur so delicately put it," 16
reflecting a widely held view at Defense---one far afield from the ideas
of unrestrained primacy. [[A similar impulse for limits]{.mark} has
[emerged in]{.mark} major [diplomatic initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In a recent essay outlining a restraint agenda, Stephen Wertheim
suggests that the United States should "seek to normalize relations with
North Korea" in part with a nuclear deal, and that it should "end its
grudge match" with Iran.17

In fact, the United States at one time embraced both these ideas in the
form of the Agreed Framework with North Korea and the Joint

**Çetindişli 24** \[Özge Gökçen Çetindişli (Ph.D. candidate, Department
of International Relations, Bursa Uludag University), 2024, "A
Methodological Discussion on Evaluating the Success of Any Securitizing
Move," International Journal of Social Inquiry, Vol. 17, No. 1, pp.
1-16, njn\] **\*Note: ST = security theory**

However, as many authors have indicated, [[there is **vagueness** around
the process by which the **securitizer** and **audience**]{.mark}
interact to [create **securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bright,
2012). Yet, [[scholars have not]{.mark} fully [**compromised**
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the questions of ‟[[Which **audience** needs to
be **convinced**]{.mark} of the legitimacy of a securitizing
move?"]{.underline} and ‟How or with what effects does the intended
audience engage in the process of securitization?" In this sense,
Williams (2011) portrays the audience as a ‟radically underdeveloped"
concept (p. 212). In this context, it can be argued that [the first
problem is heavily rooted in the uncertainty about who the]{.underline}
addressee (the audience) [will be a certain securitizing
move]{.underline}.

This paper assumes that there is little generalizability regarding the
precise identity of the audience, bearing in mind that each state,
society, or institution has a different form of government, culture, and
norms. In addition, it also supports the notion that [[any **security
policy** requires]{.mark} the [approval of **multiple
audiences**]{.mark} that may exist within a single securitization
process and that audiences often possess differential
powers]{.underline}, leading to effects on securitization outcomes.

Given this and drawing on Balzacq and Vuori's definitions, the work
posits that [the portrait of the ‟engaged audience" can be designed in a
‟case-specific" manner]{.underline}. As claimed by Vuori (2008),
‟Audiences form based on the function the securitization act is intended
to serve" (p. 72). Similarly, Balzacq's reformulation of the concept of
audience as an empowering audience, divided into moral and formal, which
enables the securitizing actor to carry out the proposed action, is also
valuable. Therefore, it can be asserted that a case-specific
characterization of audiences based on the form of government and rules
of the state in which they live and their direct connection to the
problem (legitimization and authorization of security rhetoric)
(Balzacq, 2005, pp. 8--9) or their potency to authorize security action
against the threat (Collins, 2005, pp. 572--573) or, their position
within different phases or settings of the securitization process
rhetoric (Salter, 2008, pp. 321--349) would provide analysts with a more
comprehensive analysis.

[The **precariousness** of the audience's position]{.underline} within
the theory [persists despite a growing number of **case studies**, which
is another **significant issue** closely related to the **outcomes** of
**securitization**]{.underline}. This is because, while some scholars
keep arguing that the audience is the enabler of the success of
securitization, others, like Floyd, contend that [[there is no]{.mark}
**definitive [correlation]{.mark}** [between **audience approval**
and]{.mark} the existence or [success of
**securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This ambivalence creates
ambiguity about the audience's identity and purpose, thus making the
mechanism of intersubjectivity problematic (Cô té , 2016, pp. 2--3). In
addition, [some argue that for successful securitization, audience
acceptance must encompass the securitization discourse of the agents as
well as the policy responses]{.underline} to the threat proposed by them
(Salter, 2010, pp. 116--132). For instance, Roe (2008) states that [[the
**relation** between the **securitizer** and the **audience** is]{.mark}
constituted not only in agreement with whether the support required is
either formal or moral but also in agreement with what the audience is
being asked to approve]{.underline}: ‟This is an existential threat
and/or given this is an existential threat, these are the responses I
proffer to block it (p. 622)." However, in this study, [this assessment
is regarded as **[highly exaggerated]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### General claims of "Arctic securitization" ignore nuances between every individual policy and bilateral relationship. 

**Østhagen 20** \[Andreas Østhagen (Senior Research Fellow, Fridtjof
Nansen Institute), "15. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Three Levels of
Arctic Geopolitics" in *The Arctic and World Order*, pp. 367-372, njn\]

[[It is]{.mark} therefore [futile to **generalize**]{.mark} about [how
**Arctic countries**]{.mark} themselves **[perceive]{.mark}** and
respond to their **[security]{.mark} interests**]{.underline} and
challenges across the whole northern circumpolar region.
[**[Security]{.mark}** and---essentially defense---[dynamics]{.mark} in
the Arctic [remain **anchored** in the **sub-regional**]{.mark} and
bilateral level]{.underline}. Of these, the Barents Sea/European Arctic
stand out. Here, bilateral relations between Russia and Norway are
especially challenging in terms of security interactions and concerns.
Norway is a small state and NATO member bordering a Russia---with its
potent Northern Fleet based at Severomorsk on the Kola
Peninsula---intent on investing in the Arctic for regional and strategic
purpos- es. Since 2014, defense aspects have made relations increasingly
tense, with bellicose rhetoric and a surge in military exercises on both
sides.43 In other words: [with [Russia intent on re-establishing]{.mark}
the **prominence** of [its **Northern Fleet**]{.mark} primarily for
**strategic purposes**]{.underline} (albeit with an eye towards regional
development as well), [[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}---whose defense
posture is defined by the situation in its northern
areas---[[faces]{.mark} a more **[challenging security]{.mark}**
environment]{.underline}.44

However, bilateral [[dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the case of
Norway--Russia [[are **multifaceted**]{.mark}, as the two
[states]{.mark} also [engage in]{.mark}]{.underline} various types of
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [ranging from **co-management**
of fish stocks to **search-and-rescue**]{.underline} operations and a
border crossing regime.45 Furthermore, in 2010, Norway and Russia were
able to resolve a longstanding (almost four-decadesold) maritime
boundary dispute in the Barents Sea, partly in order to be initiate
joint petroleum ventures in the disputed area.46 These [**cooperative
arrangements** and agreements have not been revoked]{.underline} after
the events of 2014,47 [[a **clear indication** of]{.mark} the
**[complexity]{.mark}** of one of the most **fraught** bilateral
relations]{.underline} in the Arctic.

[[Dynamics]{.mark} in bilateral relations in the Arctic]{.underline},
even if designated as "ugly," [**[cannot]{.mark}** simply [be defined as
**good or bad**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They are influenced by what is
taking place at the regional and international levels, but are distinct
enough so that they warrant scrutiny and examination.

Mixing Characters and Future Plot Twists

The separation between these three different levels is an analytical
tool for unpacking some of the dynamics at work in this specific part of
the world. These dynamics are not constant, but constantly evolving. Two
aspects are central in assessing how the future of Arctic security might
look: the interaction between the "levels," and the way in which the
global relationship of the great powers, in which the non-Arctic state
actor China plays a key role, affects the region. The former draws
attention to what happens regionally and what from the bilateral or
wider international plane influences regional affairs. The latter
concerns how great powers (and great power competition) external to a
region can impact region-specific developments.

Starting with regional (intra-Arctic) dynamics, the central question is
how much developments at this level can be insulated from events and
relations elsewhere. If the goal is to keep the Arctic as a separate
"exceptional" region of cooperation, the Arctic states have managed to
do a relatively good job, despite setbacks due to the Russian annexation
of Crimea in 2014. This political situation is underpinned by the Arctic
states' shared economic interest in maintaining stable regional
relations.

Moreover, we cannot discount the role of an Arctic community of experts,
ranging from diplomats participating in forums such as the Arctic
Council, to academics and businesspersons who constitute the backbone of
fora and networks that implicitly or explicitly promote northern
cooperation. The annual conferences that have emerged over the past
decade, often gathering several thousand Arctic "experts," are one such
channel.48 Here we should also note the new agreements and/ or
institutions set up to deal with specific issues in the Arctic as they
arise, such as the 2018 "A5+5" (including China, Iceland, Japan, South
Korea and the EU) agreement on preventing unregulated fishing in the
Central Arctic Ocean, or the Arctic Coast Guard Forum that was
established in 2015.49 Such agreements and interactions among "epistemic
communities"50 have a socializing effect on the Arctic states,51 as
cooperation becomes the modus operandi for dealing with Arctic issues.

[The most pressing regional challenge]{.underline}, however, [is how to
**deal with** and **talk about** Arctic-specific **security
concerns**]{.underline}, which are often excluded from such cooperative
forums and venues. The debate on what mechanisms are best suited for
further expanding security cooperation has now been ongoing for a
decade.52 Some hold that the Arctic Council should acquire a security
component,53 whereas others look to the Arctic Coast Guard Forum or
other more ad-hoc venues.54

The Northern Chiefs of Defense Conference and the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable were initiatives established to this end in 2011/2012,55 but
they fell apart after 2014. The difficulties encountered in trying to
establish an arena for security discussions indicate the high
sensitivity to, and influences from, events and evolutions elsewhere.
[[Any]{.mark} Arctic [**security dialogue** is **fragile**, and risks
being **overshadowed**]{.mark} by the increasingly tense NATO--Russia
relationship]{.underline} in Europe at large. Paradoxically, [precisely
what such an arena for dialogue is intended to achieve]{.underline}
(preventing the spillover of tensions from other parts of the world to
the Arctic) [is the very reason why progress is difficult]{.underline}.

Let us now turn us to the international level and how it impacts Arctic
affairs. Primarily, [[this concerns]{.mark} the [growing **hostility**
between]{.mark} what some refer to as "two poles"---[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its perceived
challenger [China]{.mark}]{.underline}.56 Some [[scholars]{.mark} have
[stressed the **anarchic**]{.mark} **state** of the international
**[system]{.mark}**, [where relative **power**]{.mark} considerations
and [struggles **determine** the **path taken**]{.mark}]{.underline} by
states [[and]{.mark} thus inexorably [lead to
**conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline}57 However, [such analyses focused on
relative power do not have to become self-fulfilling
prophecies]{.underline}. Measures to alleviate concerns and possible
rivalry can after all be taken at the international level---by
cooperation, by putting in place agreements, or by developing joint
institutions, thereby fostering greater trust.58

If we transfer these theories to the Arctic situation, we note that
[[China's]{.mark} increasing global **[engagement]{.mark}** and
influence [has]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact---thus far---[[been]{.mark}
rather **[subdued]{.mark}** in the North]{.underline}.
[Beijing]{.underline}, for all its rhetoric about its in interests in a
"Polar Silk Route" (2018) [has used all the correct Arctic buzzwords
about cooperation and restraint in tune with the preferences of the
Arctic states]{.underline}.59

However, [[there are **legitimate fears**]{.mark} that [this may
be]{.mark} just be a mollifying tactic]{.underline}---[merely [the
**beginning** of]{.mark} a more assertive Chinese presence where
geo-economic actions]{.underline}, i.e. financial investments with
motivated by geopolitical goals60---[are part of a [more
**ambitious**]{.mark} political [strategy aimed at
**challenging**]{.mark} the **[hegemony]{.mark}** of the
"West"]{.underline} and also the balance of power in the North.61 The
Arctic speech by U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo in 2019 fed directly
into this narrative.62 The United States obviously has a considerable
security presence in the Arctic that ranges from an air base in Thule,
rotating ships and planes at Naval Air Station Keflavik, U.S. military
personnel in Canada as part of the NORAD exchange program, rotational
deployment of U.S. Marines to Norway, as well as its own Alaskan Arctic
component.63

[The **question** is whether **Chinese actions** in the region are meant
to **challenge** this presence by an **engagement** that appears to
assumes predominantly **soft-power** characteristics]{.underline}. At
the same time, [[shifting **power**]{.mark} balances and greater
regional interest [from Beijing **need not** lead to]{.mark} tension and
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}---to the contrary, they might spur
efforts to find ways of including China in regional forums, alleviating
the (geoeconomic) concerns of Arctic states.64

[The other Great Power]{.underline} with global (international) status
as much as Arctic influence [is of course **[Russia]{.mark}**, which in
contrast to China [is]{.mark} by nature an Arctic state]{.underline}. As
the by far largest country of the circumpolar region and [[the most
**ambitious** in]{.mark} terms of **[military
investments]{.mark}**]{.underline} and activity, [[Russia sets]{.mark}
the [**parameters** for]{.mark} much of the [Arctic security]{.mark}
trajectory]{.underline}. This is not likely to change, although exactly
[how the future Arctic security environment will look like depends on
the West's response to Russian actions]{.underline} predominantly taking
place in other regions around the world.

[However, Russian military engagement in the Arctic does not have a
uniform regional effect]{.underline}: even if old bases are revived and
new ones are built along its Northern shoreline and islands, its
emphasis is concentrated in the North Atlantic/Barents Sea portions of
the wider circumpolar area. This is where the bilateral arena comes into
play. Geographic proximity does play a role. Neighbors, after all, are
forced to interact regardless of the positive or negative character of
their relations. In turn, centuries of interaction compound and form
historic patterns that influence relations beyond the immediate effects
of other crisis and developments---on the regional or global levels.65
It is precisely [[the **complexity**]{.mark} of these relations and
multiple multi-level entanglements that [make it **difficult** to
**categorize** them]{.mark} in one way or another]{.underline}.

Take Norway and Russia: the two countries collaborate on everything from
dealing with environmental concerns to cultural exchange and border
crossings, independent of events elsewhere. At the same time, these
relations are not immune to outside developments. The regional upsurge
in Arctic attention around 2007/2008 (because of flag plantings,
resource appraisals and Russia's re-focus northwards), had a positive
impact on bilateral relations. In 2010, a new "era" of Russo-Norwegian
relations was announced,66 after various forms of bilateral cooperation
had been established as the Cold War receded.

However, [**bilateral** relations are also behest to **power
asymmetry**, rivalry, and the tendency of states to revert to power
balancing]{.underline} (for example, via alliance systems). Moreover,
they are influenced by international events. When events in Ukraine
brought a deterioration in NATO--Russia relations, Norway--Russia
relations were negatively affected.67 Indeed since then mistrust and
accusations of aggressive behavior have returned, reminiscent of Cold
War dynamics.

At the same time, [bilateral relationships are **impacted** by
**regional relations**]{.underline} (say, a new agreement signed under
Arctic Council auspices), [and can in turn have an **impact** on the
**same relations**]{.underline} (deterioration in bilateral relations
might, for example, make it more difficult to agree on something in the
Arctic Council). In other words, [bilateral relations]{.underline},
especially if so delicately balanced as Norway's relations with Russia,
[can easily become **funnels** for issues and **dynamics** at
**different levels**]{.underline} in international politics.

Nonetheless, as we have mostly seen in their bilateral relations, [the
[Arctic states try]{.mark} time and again [to]{.mark} take measures to
[**deviate** from]{.mark} exogenous **[power-balancing]{.mark}**
behavior and influences]{.underline}. Through regional webs of
agreements and collaborative measures, [they seek [to reduce]{.mark}
tension and prevent **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (even if
disagreements persist over conflictual issues elsewhere). [This is the
balancing act that Arctic states]{.underline}---like states
everywhere---[must manage]{.underline}.

Conclusions

In this chapter, I have employed a stylized separation involving three
different levels---the regional, the international, and the bilateral,
or, if we wish, the "good," the "bad," and the "ugly." Crucially, what
happens in the Arctic does not remain solely in the Arctic, be it
environmentally or politically. Conversely [events and processes
**elsewhere** can in turn **impact** the Arctic]{.underline}---[in terms
of global **warming**, **security**, and desires to exploit **economic
opportunities**]{.underline}. Despite this apparent general insight,
[there are some **[paradoxical dynamics]{.mark}**---explaining the mix
of cooperation and tension if not conflict]{.underline}---[that [are
best understood through]{.mark} the threefold distinction]{.underline}
presented here: [international **[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(why the United States is increasingly focusing on China in an Arctic
context), [regional **[interaction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (why Arctic
states still meet to sign new agreements hailing the cooperative spirit
of the North), [[and **bilateral** relations]{.underline}]{.mark} (why
some Arctic states, and not others, invest heavily in their Northern
defense posture).

That the Arctic is important for the Arctic states is not new. Indeed,
increasing attention has been paid for some time now to northern
security challenges by Arctic actors (including Russia, the United
States, and by proxy the EU) and those with a growing interest in the
Arctic, like China. Yet the intensity of interests is novel. Regional
collaborative schemes have expanded in response. [The growing importance
of the region within the international system is also becoming
apparent]{.underline}. This is, however, only partly linked to events in
the Arctic (ice-melt, economic ventures, etc.). For a large part it has
to do with the strategic position of the Arctic between Asia, Europe,
and North America. On the bilateral level, [we can note some
intra-regional competition, as well as investments and
cooperation]{.underline}. However, here [[it is **difficult** to
**generalize**]{.mark} across [the Arctic]{.mark} "region," precisely
[because of the **vastness** and **inaccessibility**]{.mark} of the
area]{.underline} itself, and the complex nature of relations.

What these nuances imply is that [[simplistic **one-liner** descriptions
of "**Arctic geopolitics**" must be taken with a **pinch of
salt**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This should inspire further studies of
**security politics** in a region that]{.underline} is at least as
complex as any other part of the world, but that [has again become a
**focal point**]{.underline} as the present world order appears to be at
a tipping point.

Counter-Pressure Works

Finally and most critically, it is [simply not true]{.underline} that
[[China **can**]{.underline}]{.mark}not [[be
**deterred**]{.underline}]{.mark} and is, sooner or later, [**bound to
dominate** the region]{.underline}. The size and capability of [the
American military still **deter** outright military
**conflict**]{.underline} between China and the United States and its
treaty allies in the Asia-Pacific region. [**Everyone knows** that, so
the present situation is not the issue]{.underline}. The issue is the
path to the future, and it is here that Beijing has chosen an
asymmetrical approach to achieving its aims---specifically by working to
develop "gray zone" operations.\[10\]

Note, for example, Chinese actions in the South China Sea.\[11\]
Advances have been taken slowly and in disparate locations. They are
usually first probed not by visible state-forces, but by seemingly
private actors; and they are justified in shifting and ambiguous
language. The result is a complicated incremental assault on the status
quo. Meanwhile, if the United States and its allies act first to blunt
such "precedent creep," they open themselves to the charge of needlessly
provoking the revisionist power.\[12\] But if they wait too long, they
will confront a degraded security environment, increased questions about
their commitment and credibility, and concerns that they have
surrendered the initiative.

But for all the questions that Chinese probes have raised, [the
proposition that China is undeterrable]{.underline}, rather than
undeterred to date, stands badly in need of testing. This assumption [is
based on a **highly selective** version of]{.underline} recent [history
that **minimizes** effective **counter-pressure**]{.underline} efforts,
[**exaggerates** Chinese **strengths**]{.underline} and resolve, [and
fails to note Beijing's **weaknesses**]{.underline}. Finally, to assume
that concerted counter-pressure, discriminately applied, will have no
discernible effect on Beijing's calculations is preemptively to concede
not only the initiative on policy, but also an ever-enlarging Chinese
sphere of influence in the region---for absent U.S, leadership, the
other regional powers, their collective clout notwithstanding, will have
a hard time concerting their efforts.

Far from being undeterrable, recent history suggests a much more varied
picture of China. [[When Beijing perceives]{.mark} that its [actions are
**unlikely** to cause **pushback**]{.mark}]{.underline} or
counter-pressure, [[it]{.mark} has [**continued** pushing]{.mark}. But
[when]{.mark} Chinese activities have been [**met** with]{.mark}
concentrated [**counter-pressure**, the response has **not
been**]{.mark} predictably **[escalatory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Just
note: Japan's response to the PRC's ham-handed rollout of an ADIZ (Air
Defense Identification Zone) in the ECS in 2013; South Korea's refusal
to bow to Chinese economic pressure over the deployment of THAAD as a
defense against DPRK ballistic missiles; President Obama's 2015 threat
to impose sanctions in response to Chinese state-sponsored cyber
activities; and Obama's purported drawing of a redline around the
reclamation of Scarborough

Shoal to Xi Jinping in March 2016. While it's unclear who saved face and
who lost face in Doklam, India's response to Chinese activities in
Bhutan caused neither war nor acquiescence to Chinese probes. Similarly,
Vietnam's 2014 response to the Chinese oil rig operating in its waters,
and China's withdrawal of the rig, demonstrate that Beijing was willing
to recalibrate, if not withdraw, its activities when met with a resolute
response. Finally, for all the hand-wringing that accompanied the debate
about a quadrilateral arrangement between India, Japan, Australia, and
the United States, Beijing's actual reaction has been muted.

The same goes in the economic realm. In 2012, Washington imposed
sanction on the China-based Bank of Kunlun for its dealings with Iran.
Yet despite Chinese warnings that such a move would sour bilateral
relations and undercut Beijing's support for curbing Tehran's nuclear
ambitions, Beijing offered merely a formulaic protest, directed the bank
to cease its activities, and continued cooperation with the United
States. With respect to secondary sanctions at least, a high-ranking
Obama official who was in charge of implementing such sanctions
concluded that, despite the fears of a furious Chinese reaction and
calls for caution, "history teaches that we should not worry too much
about an adverse Chinese reaction."\[13\]

The actual, as opposed to the imagined, record of Chinese responses
suggests that [[Beijing's reaction is]{.mark} as [**dependent** on how
**others respond**]{.mark} as it is on what they wish to
achieve]{.underline}. It also implies that Chinese pressure is carefully
calibrated to fit, but not necessarily exceed, any given situation.
[China will not always **roll over** and **play dead** when
**confronted** with counter-pressure; it depends on what it **thinks is
at stake** and what **counter-pressure** indicates]{.underline} about
the intentions of others. Note, however, what happens [no
**counter-push**]{.underline} exists. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has not only manufactured features in the South China Sea, but has
[[continued]{.mark} its push [to build]{.mark} out its
[**infrastructure** and]{.mark} rotate **[military assets]{.mark}** on
them.]{.underline} Faced with the menace of increased activity around
Scarborough Shoal, while being dangled the promise of Chinese economic
largesse, the Philippines, under Rodrigo Duterte, has ceased protesting
Chinese activities. And by using Cambodia and Laos and now the
Philippines to undermine any unanimity in ASEAN, ASEAN has not even been
able to condemn Chinese bullying by name.

[[Chinese policymakers]{.mark} have [demonstrated a **logical aversion**
to conflict. They do not want to put the
**regime**]{.mark}]{.underline}'s stranglehold on Chinese society [[at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} or do things that harden the existing American
alliance structure into something more multilateral and more offensively
directed against Beijing. As a result, [[Chinese actions are]{.mark}
less reckless gambles than [**premeditated**
probes]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[14\] [[When the reaction has been
**formidable**]{.mark}, Chinese [activities have been
**recalibrated**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Understanding climate change as a **security threat** means
**understanding security** in the twenty-first century]{.underline}. In
the traditional sense, [security **revolves** around the **idea of
survival**]{.underline}. Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde of the Copenhagen
School introduced the theory that the [**existential threats** to
**security** depend on the "**relation** to the particular character of
the **referent object** in question]{.underline}."\[19\] [There is no
**universal standard** that can **define** threats]{.underline}. The
[environmental sector encompasses **broad fields** of **threats** to
security]{.underline}; it ranges from [issues of **survival** of the
species to large-scale issues such as **minimizing** the impact of big
**floods**]{.underline}. Non-traditional threats are harder to define
and require different response strategies because they focus on the
relationship between human civilization and the biosphere, and not on
the relationship among states themselves. Climate change impacts cause
two types of threats: (i) easily securitized (e.g. survival of human
civilization); and (ii) non-easily securitized (e.g. destruction of the
entire ecosystem).

[[Unlike **traditional** security threats]{.mark} that imply the
**ignition** of **one security risk**]{.underline} at different points
of time, it is possible---perhaps even likely---that [[climate change
may initiate **multiple**]{.mark} chronic
**[conditions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which could occur
[[**simultaneously** on a **global** level]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
2014, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel unveiled the Pentagon's
Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap. The central argument of this document
is that [[climate change is]{.mark} a threat [capable of **multiplying**
and **aggravating**]{.mark} already [existing
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} (water shortages, droughts, etc.) [[as
well as generating]{.mark} **fertile ground** for **[future]{.mark}**

Nonetheless, the theory of climate security has been exposed to
criticism. Alan Dupont, an academic at the University of Sydney, states
that environmental threats are not going to act as main triggers of
major conflict between states.\[21\] In his opinion, climate change
impacts complicate existing disputes and create tensions, but they do
not act as a direct cause of conflict. Daniel Deudney, a professor of
Political Science at Johns Hopkins University with strong connections to
the theory of geopolitics and republicanism, is completely against the
idea of environmental security. According to Deudney, the concept of
national security is centered on the idea of organized violence.\[22\]
Hence, he argues that natural disasters are elements of unorganized
violence that cannot be included under the umbrella of national security
doctrine. In his view, national security planning is characterized by a
zero-sum assessment, nationalism, and power maximization. Therefore,
threats from climate change are not logical inputs to any of these
concepts and including them in security calculations only creates
confusion in the political leadership and makes them prone to conducting
an impetuous foreign policy.

Deudney's concept of national security as organized violence is in
complete contrast to the national security policies of some European
Union (EU) and NATO member states. Addressing climate change through the
mitigation principle has been firmly integrated into EU-wide 20-20-20
greenhouse gases (GHGs) policy reduction targets.\[23\] Correspondingly,
in 2016 the German government issued a white paper, which categorizes
climate change as permanent item on its national security agenda.\[24\]
[Beck classifies [climate change]{.mark} as [a **threat**]{.mark} that
is [**so large** it **cannot be contained** on the **national level**,
but is]{.mark} more [a concern with **global
implications**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, he argues the following
on the notion of global risk, "[The **experience** of global risks is an
**occurrence** of abrupt and fully **conscious confrontation** with the
apparently **excluded other**]{.underline}. [[Global risks **tear down**
national **boundaries** and **jumble**]{.mark} together [the **native**
with the **foreign**]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[25\]

Wolfers agrees that the nature and source of a threat define the scope
of security. [[Securitizing climate change is **necessary** because
climate change is **inseparable** from **human
security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At present, [traditional security
discourse must **reexamine** its state-centric conceptual approach to
security]{.underline}. A monodisciplinary approach that emphasizes the
maximization of power is highly unlikely to comprehend and respond to
the serious existential challenges facing humanity in the twenty-first
century[. [In order to **properly confront**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
threat of [**climate change**, states]{.mark} will [need to]{.mark}
develop an **interdisciplinary** approach that **[include]{.mark}**s the
inputs of a **range of experts** from **[environmentalists]{.mark}** to

5.2 SHOULD CYBERSPACE BE DESECURITISED?

Desecuritisation is the process by which an issue is removed from the
security sphere and is no longer considered to be an urgent threat,
requiring exceptional measures to counter. For the Copenhagen School,
'it means not to have issues phrased as "threats against which me have
countermeasures" but to move them out of this threat-defense sequence
and into the ordinary public sphere' (Busan, et al., 1998, p. 29).

But [[desecuritisation is **difficult to achieve** once]{.mark} an issue
has been [**accepted** as threatening and]{.mark} desecuritisation [does
**not guarantee**]{.mark} than a[n issue will become **re-
politicised**]{.mark} and re-open to **public debate**]{.underline}. If
securitising moves are rejected forcefully enough, then issues can
become both de-securitised and de-politicised (See Figure 5.1). This
means that [not only are the issues considered **non- threatening**, but
they are also **closed** for **discussion**]{.underline}. Islamic
extremism and immigration are issues that are often difficult to discuss
in a political environment because they are either securitised as
existentially threatening or de-politicised because the responses to
them are considered threatening, racist or intolerant.

Cyberspace scholars are in general agreement that cyberspace
securitisation has mainly negative consequences. Kingsmith, for example,
discusses the negative consequences that emerge from moves by states to
securitise internet content.

Considering these securitising moves \... the more that filtering
practices are withheld from public scrutiny and accountability, the more
tempting it is for framing authorities to employ these tools for
illegitimate reasons such as the stifling of both opposition and civil
society networks (Kingsmith, 2013, p. 1).

Deibert also highlights the negative consequences of the securitisation
of cyberspace, including the resultant threats to basic freedoms.

[There has been a growing [recognition of **serious risks** in
**cyberspace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The need to manage these risks has
[**led** to]{.mark} a wave of **[securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline}
efforts that have potentially serious implications for basic freedoms
(Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010, p. 49).

Whilst arguing that the securitisation of cyberspace is negative and
inevitable, Deibert also contends that the form [of this securitisation
can be influenced. 'The [**securitization** of cyberspace may be
**inevitable**]{.mark}, but what form that security takes is
not']{.underline} (Deibert, 2012, p. 274). He suggests that it is better
to securitise threats to human rights than to securitise threats to
national security. Mariya Georgieva takes this further, citing the
Snowden disclosures as an example of the securitisation of digital
rights, arguing that Snowden had 'successfully shifted the focus of the
securitisation of cyberspace from values such as the survival of the
state and effective national security to the survival of privacy and
personal choice' (Georgieva, 2015, p. 44). Whilst she celebrates this
shift she does not explain why it is better to securitise privacy rather
than national security. Helen Nissenbaum is one author who does take a
more consequentialist approach to **[[cyberspace
securitisation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, arguing that it [[might be
**justified** when the **threat** is]{.mark} as **[extreme]{.mark}** as
its proponents claim]{.underline}.

If those who subscribe to a conception of security as cybersecurity are
right, particularly [[if the **magnitude**]{.mark} of threat [is]{.mark}
as **great** as those on the **[extreme]{.mark}**s claim]{.underline},
then [an [**extraordinary response** is **warranted** despite]{.mark}
its **[chilling]{.mark}** effects]{.underline} (Nissenbaum, 2005, p.
73).

However, this approach is rare and most literature is either critical of
state surveillance and the securitisation of cyberspace, or is
complimentary of Edward Snowden and supportive of the securitisation of
individual privacy. Given that a narrow majority of the British public
support greater efforts to protect national security it is surprising
that academic literature is weighted so strongly towards criticisms of
state surveillance and the securitisation of national security (Pew
Research Centre, 2016). [Even when cyberspace securitisation by
non-state actors is addressed]{.underline}, such as in Georgieva's work
on Snowden as an alternative securitizing actor, [[these forms]{.mark}
of securitisation [are considered **positive** because they **support
human rights**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the US and UK, [academics have
also been politically active in **opposing state
surveillance**]{.underline}. In 2014 over one thousand scholars from a
wide range of disciplines formed the 'academics against surveillance'
campaign, which published an open letter criticising state surveillance
(Electronic Frontier Foundation, 2014).

Whilst [there is **disagreement** over whether **desecuritisation** is
always **best** and what types of securitisation should be]{.underline}
reversed, there are a variety of means through which desecuritisation
can be achieved.

of SARS and avian influenza," Health Policy and Planning, Vol. 25, No.
6, pp. 454-466, njn\]

[SARS first appeared in Guangdong province in southern
China]{.underline} in November 2002, then spread to 28 countries,
infecting 8096 people and resulting in 774 deaths, according to data
from the World Health Organization (WHO). [This case study raises
interesting questions about securitizing actors]{.underline}. Although
SARS originated in China and disproportionately afflicted Chinese
citizens (5327 infected and 349 dead), Chinese authorities were not [the
first to securitize the disease]{.underline}; rather this [role fell to
WHO]{.underline} and a retired Chinese military doctor who posted his
concerns on the web. In fact [[Chinese leaders]{.mark} initially [sought
to **desecuritize SARS**]{.mark}. Despite the **tendency** of the
Copenhagen School to treat **desecuritization** as a **desirable**
outcome]{.underline}, indicating the end of extreme measures and their
resulting negative impacts on social freedoms[, in the case of SARS,
**[desecuritization]{.mark}** actually [led to **further restrictions**
on freedom]{.mark}]{.underline} of expression. The first incidence of
SARS (initially called atypical pneumonia) was reported in Guangdong
province in mid-November 2002, but Chinese provincial officials withheld
information about the disease from the general public for another 3
months. On 11 February 2003, the Guangdong government finally made a
statement about the disease, the same day that the official Communist
Party newspaper, People\'s Daily, announced on its website that the
province had succeeded in controlling the outbreak, though five deaths
were reported (Congressional- Executive Commission on China 2003: 2;
Huang 2003: 10). SARS then spread to Hong Kong later in February 2003,
after a visiting doctor from Guangdong developed symptoms, and then
continued to spread globally. Although the territory would go on to play
a key role in publicizing and countering the disease, the story of SARS
in Hong Kong is not included in this case study, as the securitization
dynamics played out quite differently there than on the mainland, due to
the more open social and political environment in the Special
Administrative Region (on SARS in Hong Kong, see Loh 2004; Abraham
2005). The timing of the new disease was especially unfortunate for the
Chinese leadership; coinciding with a period of leadership change,
spanning from the 16th Communist Party Congress in November 2002 to the
National People\'s Congress in March 2003. The Chinese Ministry of
Health reportedly sent a team to Guangdong to investigate in late
January, but the results were classified \'top secret\' and no
nation-wide health advisory was issued until 3 April (Huang 2003: 9-10).
The Chinese government also refused to cooperate with WHO until April
2003. [**[Desecuritization]{.mark}** in this instance [turned
out]{.mark} to be [**far from optimal**, resulting in the **spread**
of]{.mark} the **[disease]{.mark}** throughout China and [**globally**,
as well as]{.mark} in the **[restriction of information]{.mark}** on
public health inside and outside the country]{.underline}.
Securitization The Copenhagen School assumes that securitizing actors
are collectivities, or at least their designated representatives who
enjoy a position of authority. Because a successful securitization
involves convincing an audience of the urgency of a particular threat,
most Copenhagen School scholars tend to discount the likelihood of
individuals accomplishing a securitizing move (Buzan 1997: 19; Buzan et
al. 1997: 33, 40-41; Huysmans 1998: 493; Hansen 2000: 289), though
others emphasize that what really matters is the speaker\'s social
capital (Vuori 2008: 77), positional power (Stritzel 2007: 364) or
relationship to the audience (Balzacq 2005: 272). [The SARS case raises
**new questions** about **securitizing actors** and the role of the
audience]{.underline}. Although in the case of SARS [the initial
**securitizing move** came from an **international
organization**]{.underline} - the WHO, which issued a global health
alert on 12 March 2003, followed by an emergency travel advisory on 15

Continually, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} declares
that the "[[strategy is rooted in]{.mark} our **[national
interests]{.mark}**: [to protect]{.mark} the **[security]{.mark}** of
the American people]{.underline}" and "to expand economic prosperity and
opportunity" (The White House 2022b: 7; USDD 2022: 1). Continuing down
the line regarding interests, the National Security Strategy states that
the United States is a "world power with global interests" and that in
order to advance American prosperity the state will work to shape the
international world order in order for it to align with the American
interests and values (The White House 2022b: 11), [which can be [related
to]{.mark} the US [seeing the **Arctic** as a]{.mark} "new strategic
[theatre for **competition**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Gricius 2021: 19).
Additionally, [the US aspires [to **reduce risk** and
**prevent**]{.mark} unnecessary [**escalation** in the region]{.mark},
as well as protecting "freedom of navigation and determine the US
extended continental shelf in accordance with international
rules]{.underline}" (The White House 2022b: 45).

[National defence, **homeland security** and **safe** commercial and
**scientific activities** are further listed as American **Arctic
interests**]{.underline} (The White House 2023: 6), and that [the
Department of Defence will "**deter threats** to the US homeland from
and **through the Arctic** region"]{.underline} (USDD 2022: 16). This
can be related to the fact that [[the US has given the
**Arctic**]{.mark} region **[more attention]{.mark}** in recent years,
especially [in relation to **Russian military efforts**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline} (Bye 2020: 82--83, 93). [The United States' desired
outcomes in the Arctic region are to preserve its navigational rights
and freedoms]{.underline} in Arctic waters, [**monitor threats** to the
**freedom** of navigation and to **protect** the **global mobility** of
the US and its **allies** and **partner forces**]{.underline} (USDD
2024: 16), [[security interests have been **prominent** in]{.mark}
American [Arctic strategies]{.mark} since the Bush administration in
2009]{.underline} (Bye 2020: 86).

[When [looking at]{.mark} the different Arctic aspirations, intentions
and interests of [**Russia** and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates one
[can **quickly detect**]{.mark} several [**similarities** in]{.mark}
their 34 (63) respective **[strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Both]{.mark} state that they [seek to **preserve stability**]{.mark}
in the region, increase **[national defence]{.mark}**, [ensure]{.mark}
their Arctic territorial **[sovereignty]{.mark}** and military security,
[as well as **economic interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} relating to
regional economic development and navigational rights in connection to
the Northern Sea Route and Arctic waters. [[Both]{.mark} states also
declare that they [intend to **maintain**]{.mark} their [status as
**great powers**]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. There are however a
few differences, where Russia for example aspires to stop the
delimitation of its continental shelf and has more specific economic
interests concerning natural resources in the region. United States on
the other hand focuses more on expanding economic opportunities, working
for more Arctic cooperation with the Arctic Council and to defend global
mobility in the region.

[[What all]{.mark} of the [strategies have in **common** is]{.mark}
nevertheless that [they]{.mark} all seemingly [stem from the
**neorealist** perspective of **structural
anarchy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means that the [Arctic
[aspirations]{.mark}, intentions and interests of Russia the United
States [all can be **interpreted** as]{.mark} goals]{.underline} that
are [[**centered** around the concept of **self-help**]{.mark} that will
help the states **survive** [in the **international
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as there is no central authority that
rules over the system (Smith 2021: 16--17). One can also argue that the
different aspirations are not only motivated by a desire of survival and
self-preservation, but that [[one can detect]{.mark} a [**desire to
dominate** the region as **both**]{.mark} states [refer to themselves as
**great powers**]{.mark} that defends the rights that they think they
are entitled to]{.underline} (Waltz 1979: 91, 118). [[This]{.mark} also
[**aligns** with the **neorealist perspective** that great
powers]{.mark} often [are concerned with **ensuring**]{.mark} their own
**[security]{.mark}** for themselves]{.underline}, as there is not
higher authority that can work to protect them, which one could say is
[reflected in that both Russia and the United States are concerned with
self-preserving interests such as economic opportunities and national
defence in the region]{.underline} (Parent & Rosato 2015: 52). [It is
also clear that [their]{.mark} **respective [identities]{.mark}**,
especially in regards to being recognised [as grea**t powers**]{.mark},
[play a **vital part** in **shaping**]{.mark} their [Arctic
interests]{.mark}, policies and strategies]{.underline} (Hopf 1998: 175,

[[The]{.mark} broader and more [**dark picture** of the]{.mark}
**current state** of the [**world** gives]{.mark} one more [reason to
**value**]{.mark} the **high [stability]{.mark}** [of the Arctic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}, that the Arctic is not isolated but keenly a part
of the globe and is heavily impacted by globalization and its
multifunctional effects; furthermore, that [the globalized Arctic has
its **global implications** and drivers that **affect** both the
**region** and the rest of the **globe**]{.underline}, as it is
described in the GlobalArctic project (www.globalarctic.org). Recent
[[industrial developments]{.mark}, such as aggressively **expanding**
exploitation of **minerals** and (off-shore) **hydrocarbon**
resources]{.underline} due to increasing resource demand, on the one
hand, [[bring]{.mark} new and more [**dangerous** environmental]{.mark}
and societal **[risks]{.mark}** to the **Arctic** and its
people]{.underline}(s) -- they have already created the 'Arctic Paradox'
-- [and on the other hand, have **feedbacks** related to global
**energy** and **natural resource** systems]{.underline}. From this we
can conclude that on the other hand, the 'Antropocene' is already at
play in the Arctic, as Finger discusses in his chapter, and on the other
hand, what happens in the Arctic matters on a global scale.

To conclude, [[the Arctic]{.mark} region with its high political
stability]{.underline}, as well as military structures based on the
nuclear weapon systems of Russia and the United States, [and
[with]{.mark} a [keen **international**]{.mark}]{.underline} (mostly
multilateral) **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, much initiated and
supported by nonstate actors, [[could be interpreted]{.mark} to be
[positively **'exceptional'**]{.mark} and **left out** of **regional

the Arctic and international [Arctic [**cooperation** would]{.mark} be
and [become a]{.mark} joint **[valuable]{.mark}**, human-made
**[asset]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the eight Arctic states, as the
International Space Station (ISS) acts for Russia and the United States
and their space cooperation. Furthermore, here the Arctic /
international [Arctic **cooperation** would be a **reserve** [for the
**future**]{.mark}, the moment, when it is, again, needed to **calm
down** and to **press reset**.]{.underline} [The situation might **come
sooner** than **later**, [when the world]{.mark}]{.underline}, including

more serious regional and irrational warfare than the threat by ISIS and
the exposing middle East, that is, [real big **[worldwide
challenges]{.mark}** and threats, [such as immediate]{.mark} impacts of
rapid [**climate change** and the
**'Anthropocene'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In this kind of situation, [[the Arctic]{.mark} would [act as a **test
ground**]{.mark} and a workshop [to **examine**]{.mark} and test soft
ways of **governance** [and brainstorm]{.mark} an
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} way to definite [[**security** by
causing a **paradigm shift**]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Heininen in this

interesting feature of Arctic security is the coexistence of several
concepts of security and its **transformation**]{.underline} from
traditional and state-controlled security to human security [with an
emphasis on the **environment**]{.underline}, or economic
development/security, and that they are closely related to each other
[making 'Arctic security' a **special** kind of **phenomenon** to

the future securities of the global Arctic there are challenges, which
go beyond state sovereignty and nationalistic security thinking.

Security Dialogue, Vol. 52, Issue 4,
https://doi.org/10.1177/0967010620945081, njn\]

The project of critical security studies was born out of an
acknowledgement of the implicit and explicit violence stemming from the
hegemony of security-cum-balance. In what follows, I will discuss the
limits of both deconstructive and reconstructive approaches in critical
security studies' engagement with the dominant logics of security.

[The deconstructive field includes a number of **epistemological
endeavors**]{.underline} -- including poststructuralist, constructivist,
neo-Marxist, post- and de-colonial, feminist, and queer approaches --
[to overcome traditional, **realist views** of security]{.underline}.
This field has been quite successful -- to the point of constituting a
new mainstream in security studies14 -- in exposing the 'dark side' of
security, its role in impeding the realization of a democratic politics
(see Neal, 2019), and more generally its crucial role in the maintenance
of the capitalist order (with its violence!). The ultimate version of
this critique is offered by Mark Neocleous, who, by exposing the roots
of contemporary security, beyond Hobbes, in liberal and Enlightenment
thinkers such as Mill, Rousseau, Smith, and Bentham, has challenged the
'myth' of the balance at its roots: security has always been the central
goal of liberal thought, and liberty is systematically infringed in
security's name (Neocleous, 2007, 2008). Security, Neocleous concluded,
is the political technology of liberalism; it is a project of social
order (Neocleous, 2001) and must therefore be rejected (Neocleous,
2000). [The [**rejection** of security remains at the core of]{.mark}
other strands of **[deconstruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance,
among the central tenets of the Copenhagen School is the idea that
securitization is at odds with politics. Indeed, Ole Wæver (2011: 478n2)
has even characterized security as a Schmittian concept. Granted, I am
not suggesting that deconstructive approaches are not interested in the
'tangible security'15 of individuals and communities -- quite the
opposite -- but rather that [they have explicitly or implicitly
concluded that only by **abandoning** the concept of
'security']{.underline} -- and, in some cases, replacing it with other
concepts like care or humanism -- can we strive for it.

I want to argue, then, that the critique of securitization, liberal
balance, and the persistent chimera of absolute security does not imply
that we need to reject security as a concept. In order to make this
point, I will start by unpacking a corollary of the deconstructive
argument, [[the idea that security is inherently
**antagonistic**]{.mark} to rights]{.underline} (Goldstein, 2010: 499).
This formulation, which is coherent with the deconstruction of the myth
of balancing security with freedom, [[neglects]{.mark} to acknowledge
[that **security** is a **right** too]{.mark}]{.underline}, though not
only a right.16 Security -- [a certain degree of [**freedom** from
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[is **necessary** for]{.mark} the
[**flourishing** of **individuals**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Nussbaum,
2011) [[and]{.mark} for the [**empowerment** of oppressed
groups]{.mark}]{.underline} (see, for instance, bell hooks \[1991: 47\]
on the importance of the home as a space of personal safety in the
experience of black and brown women in the USA). [Once we take
**security beyond securitization** seriously, [the limits of
**deconstructive critique** become **evident**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
one thing, [[by **overly focusing** on security]{.mark} as
**[discourse]{.mark}** and speech act]{.underline}, constructivist and
post-structuralist [[approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. Huysmans,
2011; Williams, 2003) [have largely [**neglected** to engage with
**insecurity**]{.mark} and violence existing **[beyond
securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the machine of state security.
On their side, critiques brought to the core of security theories have
demonstrated that actually existing security is inherently defined by
the liberal/Western project of social order, but this does not exclude
per se the possibility of finding different roots for security outside
of that very order -- security existed, for better or worse, before the
liberal order was created, and there may well be theories of security
outside of the hegemony of liberal/Western thought. By focusing on
discourses, theories, and practices (Harrington, 2017), in short,
critique has forgotten the ontological dimension -- that is, 'the desire
for security -- understood as certitude and trust -- \[which\] is
seemingly universal and timeless' (Harrington, 2017: 76, emphasis
added).
