"President Trump's executive order would roll back millions of acres of
ocean protection, jeopardizing our coastal economies and the people who
rely on healthy, thriving oceans," said Oceana Campaign Director Joseph
Gordon. [["Leaders in both political parties, thousands of businesses,

"Americans across the country overwhelmingly agree --- [[we must protect
our coasts, not destroy them]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Oceana Campaign
Director Joseph Gordon. "We know [[oil spills wreck economies and
businesses, kill wildlife, and devastate coastlines. These consequences
are why there is a strong bipartisan tradition to protect our oceans
from drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we approach the [15th
anniversary](https://usa.oceana.org/the-deepwater-horizon-disaster-15-years-later/)
of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, we can't let the tragic lessons from
that destructive legacy be forgotten. Oceana will stand with coastal
communities again and hold the line to protect our coasts from toxic and
destructive offshore drilling." The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
sets out the Five-Year Plan process for the executive branch to propose
when and where to offer leases for offshore oil and gas drilling.
Separately, [[the law gives presidents the power to withdraw areas from
availability for oil and gas leasing. Presidents from both parties have
used this authority to withdraw large areas from oil and gas
leasing,]{.underline}]{.mark} including President Trump, who withdrew
the Southeast coast from Florida to North Carolina for 10 years in 2020.
Bipartisan Congressional support for coastal protection remains strong.
[[Over the past decade, more than 390 municipalities, 60,000 businesses,

President Donald [[Trump is pushing for an expansion of offshore oil and
gas drilling]{.underline}]{.mark} across the U.S., [[a proposal with a
history of opposition even among leaders of the Republican
party]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Among the 42 executive orders Trump signed
on his first day was an attempt to repeal Biden's]{.underline}]{.mark}
Jan. 6 [[order to protect most U.S. offshore waters from leasing for oil

the Pacific, Atlantic, and Alaska and the eastern part of the Gulf of
Mexico, though Biden allowed oil and gas production to continue in the
western and central Gulf.

#### No public support for new oil and gas drilling in the arctic

Receives Bipartisan Support To Protect The Arctic From More Drilling\",
Alaska Sporting Journal,
https://aksportingjournal.com/poll-receives-bipartisan-support-to-protect-the-arctic-from-more-drilling/.
MSU-shARK Accessed 8-4-2025.

(Washington, D.C.) -- [A new poll released today by Taxpayers for Common
Sense and Backcountry Hunters & Anglers reveals [strong bipartisan
support]{.mark} among voters [in battleground congressional districts
for policies that protect America's Arctic and avoid]{.mark} the costly
and speculative push for [new oil and gas
development.]{.mark}]{.underline} The poll, conducted by Peak Insights,
shows that swing district [voters support such protections by a
significant 57-32 percent majority, with 45 percent indicating "strongly
support."]{.underline}

The survey, which included 1,250 likely 2026 general election voters
across 10 key [battleground congressional districts, found that
majorities of voters in all 10 districts support Arctic
protections.]{.underline}

"[This poll demonstrates that voters, even in politically diverse
battleground districts, understand drilling in the Arctic isn't just
risky for the environment, it is a terrible deal for
taxpayers]{.underline} c," said Autumn Hanna, Vice President of
Taxpayers for Common Sense. ["Moreover, the data shows that the argument
for drilling in the Arctic based on unrealistic revenue projections
doesn't resonate with voters.]{.underline} Our analysis has consistently
shown that revenue from these projects would raise less than 3% of the
often-claimed \$900 million, making it a bad deal for taxpayers. Voters
see through the unrealistic promises and want our leaders to prioritize
protecting this national treasure."

Key findings from the poll, also highlighted in this memo, include:

Overwhelming Support for Arctic Protection: [[57%]{.mark} of all swing
district voters [support policies to protect America's Arctic from new
oil and gas development,]{.mark} compared to just 32% who
oppose.]{.underline}

Concerns about Taxpayer [Risk: 57% agree that "President Trump's 'energy
emergency' is unnecessary]{.underline}, given that the U.S. is the
largest producer of oil in the world, and it risks being a bad deal for
taxpayers." Additionally, [[52% agree]{.mark} "[We should prioritize
energy production outside]{.mark} Alaska's [Arctic
region]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other areas where it is easier to access
and cheaper to produce."

A majority (57%) of those polled say Congress's reliance on unrealistic
revenue projections from Arctic Refuge leasing to justify their proposed
trillion-dollar tax cut is a compelling reason to oppose new oil and gas
development in America's Arctic.

Support for Outdoor Recreation and Conservation: Majorities of all swing
district voters found messages opposing new oil and gas drilling in the
Arctic convincing, including the argument that selling off these public
lands would set a dangerous precedent, and that speculative leasing
sacrifices proven economic gains from outdoor recreation for uncertain
drilling prospects for unpredictable drilling opportunities.

A 58% majority says that drilling proponents' willingness to sacrifice
iconic wildlife and Alaska's \$3 billion outdoor recreation economy for
uncertain drilling prospects is a compelling reason to oppose new oil
and gas development in America's Arctic.

[Broad Consensus Across Battleground Congressional Districts: Majorities
of voters [in]{.mark} every battleground congressional district surveyed
--- [AZ]{.mark}-06, [CA]{.mark}-13, CO-03, [GA]{.mark}-02,
[ME]{.mark}-02, [NE]{.mark}-02, [NY]{.mark}-17, [PA]{.mark}-07, PA-08,
[and WA-]{.mark}03 --- support Arctic protections.]{.underline}

Skepticism on Consumer Benefits From Oil and Gas Development: [[61% of
voters agree]{.mark} that "Drilling in America's Arctic will not lower
gas prices. Even if approved today, [we are]{.mark} years, if not
[decades, away from any oil being produced]{.mark}."]{.underline}

"Sportsmen and women have a deep connection to America's wild places,
and the Arctic is no exception," said Kaden McArthur, Director of Policy
and Government Relations for Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. "This poll
confirms that the public understands the value of these irreplaceable
landscapes for wildlife, outdoor recreation, and future generations.
They recognize that opening the Arctic to industrial development not
only threatens vital habitats but also undermines proven economic
benefits, such as Alaska's \$3 billion annual recreation economy. It's
time for policymakers to listen to the will of the people and prioritize
conservation over speculative and risky drilling ventures."

The poll was conducted by Peak Insights from June 7-16, 2025, and
included N=1,250 interviews among likely 2026 general election voters[.
The survey utilized a mixed-mode approach of live interviews (landline
and cell phone) and text-to-online (P2P) responses. The margin of error
for the overall sample of 1,250 is +/- 3% at the 95% confidence
level.]{.underline}

["We find both sides to have compelling arguments to make their case,
but after hearing both pro and con arguments the voters in these ten
districts nonetheless still come down on the side of protecting
America's Arctic region in Alaska,"]{.underline} said Hans Kaiser,
Partner with Peak Insights as a part of a poll memo released today with
these results.

#### Offshoring drilling is an extremely disruptive environmental risk -- it increases emissions & climate change, threatens biodiversity and habitats, and causes oil spills. Warming will also erode the infrastructure of extraction, posing even greater risk.

habitats and communities, but the increased greenhouse gas emissions
from greater fossil fuel use will accelerate climate change in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Average temperatures in the Arctic [were

levels](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/20/heatwaves-at-both-of-earth-poles-alarm-climate-scientists?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other).
That level of [[warming is literally eroding the very foundations of
hydrocarbon extraction in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Much of the
oil and gas infrastructure is built on permafrost which is thawing. This
is necessitating many millions of dollars of investment simply to shore
up existing capacity. Indeed, [[one of the worst pollution disasters in

[[Global climate change affects the Arctic region more than any other
part of the world]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[the Arctic is warming up to
seven times faster than mid-latitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
eco-activists and environmental organizations point out that this
process is a threat to the whole world, oil and gas companies see a
great opportunity in developing their offshore projects on the
continental shelf due to several reasons. Firstly, the melting of
glaciers and sea ice provides access to the new oil and gas fields that
are estimated to account for 5.3 percent and 21.7 percent of the global
proved oil and gas reserves. Secondly, a longer ice-free period reduces
the costs of exploration and production activities. Thus, the Arctic has
a potential for hydrocarbon's energy development and hence the problem
of affiliated pollution is acute. Scientific research is mostly
concerned with the remote sources of Arctic pollution. However, [[the
ongoing oil and gas extraction on the Arctic continental shelf has
already had a devastating impact on the composition of the Arctic
atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the main sources of Arctic air
pollution is gas flaring -- the practice of burning associated gas, a
common byproduct of oil extraction. The joint study of Norwegian,
Finnish, and Russian scholars concluded that in the [[Arctic region gas
flaring contributes to a much larger share of total black carbon
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}: in fact, [[it accounts for 42 percent of
all Arctic black carbon surface concentrations, when the global average
is only 3 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is essential to highlight
that the method of gas flaring is used at the Prirazlomnoye field, the
only Russian project on the Arctic shelf.**6)** In 2021 140.57 million
m3 were flared on the Prirazlomnaya offshore platform.**7)** The
[[pollutants released during the gas flaring and other oil and gas
exploration activities on the Arctic shelf facilitate the warming of
this region, which has implications for the biodiversity in the area and
the lives of at least 5 million people]{.underline}]{.mark},including
the Indigenous peoples. Therefore, the issue of the pollution related to
oil and gas extraction on the Arctic shelf is worth consideration.

[[Climate change is permanently altering the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the results are startling. As
ecosystems unravel, fragile species such as polar bears are struggling
to survive, shorelines are eroding, waters are becoming increasingly
acidic, snow and ice are vanishing at an alarming rate, and storms are
more severe and unpredictable than ever before. [[At the heart of the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}, however[[, lies human activity---our
addiction to fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Jason Box, Greenland
expert at the Byrd Polar Research Center, explains, "Those who claim
it's all cycles just don't understand that humans are driving the cycle
right now, and for the foreseeable future." [[Rather than respond to
this crisis with serious policies]{.underline}]{.mark} to significantly
and swiftly reduce our carbon emissions, governments with jurisdiction
over the Arctic have taken [[the reckless approach of moving forward
with plans to exploit the newly accessible fossil fuels and accelerate
the destruction. Decisions regarding whether to allow potentially

and climate damage over the long term]{.underline}]{.mark}. The proposal
is now open for a 60-day public comment period, providing the public
with an opportunity to express their views. As the Arctic experiences
rapid warming at an unprecedented rate, advocates emphasize the urgency
of safeguarding wildlands. [[These areas serve as vital natural defenses
against the climate crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, making this a crucial
time for action.

[[Energy extraction and exploration have the potential to worsen the
effects of climate change on the Arctic
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[There are unavoidable impacts on the
environment at each phase of energy development, including seismic
explorations, exploratory drilling, pipelines, offshore and onshore
terminals, and tankers.]{.underline}]{.mark} First, [[the acoustic
disturbance to marine mammals]{.underline}]{.mark} such as seals,
whales, and walruses as a product of seismic exploration [[would
negatively affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the mammals' [[migration
patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}, feeding, mating, and communication. But
this is just the beginning. In the likely case of [[an oil
spill]{.underline}]{.mark}, this spill [[would \"undoubtedly cause
extensive acute mortality in plankton, fish, birds, and marine
mammals]{.underline}]{.mark} \... \[and\] there would also be
significant \... physiological damage, altered feeding behavior and
reproduction, and genetic injury that would reduce the overall viability
of populations.\"39 Because oil persists in the Arctic for longer
periods of time, there is no telling how long an oil spill would cause
damage in this fragile environment. It is also known that Arctic flora
and fauna do not quickly adapt to a changing environment, making
recovery of species nearly impossible.40 With the increase in global
population, food demand will increase. [[An oil spill in Arctic waters
would]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[disrupt fish
stock]{.underline}]{.mark} sustainability, but would have second and
third order effects on global demand for food, especially for China,
which has the world's largest population of people, and is the world's
top fish consumer.41 On a more local level, an oil spill in the Arctic
would seriously harm the Arctic natives' food sources and lifestyle.

[[The prospect of industrializing the fragile Arctic becomes even
riskier when examined in the context of climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Arctic region is feeling the
devastating effects of climate change more than anywhere else on the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, undergoing an alarming transformation as it
warms at about twice the rate of the rest of the globe. The rapid rate
of change means our baseline of scientific knowledge about the region is
constantly shifting, further complicating the ability to make informed
decisions regarding industrial activity in the region, including oil and
gas development, fishing, shipping, and tourism. The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's 2012 Arctic Report Card documented a
very grim year for the region and found "strong evidence of widespread,
sustained change driving Arctic environmental system into new state,"
including record-low sea ice extent, record ice sheet surface melting in
Greenland, record-high permafrost temperature, and record-low snow
extent. Moreover, [[the region's rapid loss of snow and ice has a
snowball effect that speeds melting:]{.underline}]{.mark} The decrease
in sea ice cover, snow cover, glaciers, and Greenland ice sheet means
that the bright, white surfaces that reflect summer sunlight are being
replaced by darker surfaces---ocean and land---that absorb sunlight.
[[These conditions increase the capacity to store heat within the Arctic
system, which induces more melting---a positive
feedback.]{.underline}]{.mark} Another feedback response exists in the
thawing tundra---[[melting permafrost also accelerates warming by
releasing a frozen cache of carbon into the
atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark} that will likely add 0.4 degrees
Fahrenheit to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit to total global warming by 2100.34
According to a November 2012 United Nations Environment Programme
report, [[the frozen organic matter that exists in permafrost contains
almost twice as much carbon than is currently present in the
atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. If that organic material were to thaw,
then it would subsequently decay, releasing large amounts of carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere and amplifying the warming
already underway. [[Black carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}, a component of
fine particle [[pollution that is emitted through a variety of
combustion processes, has also been identified as a significant factor
contributing to observed and projected rates of Arctic climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}. As an aerosol, black carbon absorbs
incoming solar radiation, heating the atmosphere and contributing to
overall global and Arctic warming. [[When deposited onto Arctic ice and
snow, it darkens the surface, increasing the absorption of
radiation.]{.underline}]{.mark} While countries in close proximity to
the Arctic have used better controls on air pollution to reduce black
carbon emissions, increased industrial activity in the Arctic could
reverse this trend. Lastly, the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions
from human activity promises---in addition to its effect on climate---to
drastically change the biological and chemical processes that occur in
our oceans. Confirming this trend, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change's 2007 report concluded that [[if carbon dioxide
emissions are not constrained, we can expect the average acidity of our
oceans to increase by 100 percent to 150 percent by
2100.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Arctic is particularly vulnerable to
ocean acidification due to its cooler water and low salinity. Cooler
water allows for carbon dioxide to be dissolved more quickly into the
Arctic Ocean, while lower salinity reduces the ability of the ocean to
buffer against acidification. Because of these factors, if current rates
of carbon dioxide emissions are left unconstrained, the acidity of the
Arctic Ocean will rise sharply.

#### Energy extraction is a threat to water security, harms indigenous people, and risks other environmental consequences

Out of the eight Arctic countries, seven have surviving [[indigenous
people]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their cultures are highly diverse, but all
[[depend on the natural Arctic environment for their
sustainment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Arctic wildlife and environments
form the foundation of the Arctic natives' survival and
cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 An oil spill in the Arctic would
certainly change the way that these people operate every day. The
presence of energy infrastructure also contributes to the loss of
pasture lands for reindeer herds, pollution of lakes, pollution of
groundwater, and to a disruption of animal migratory patterns. [[One
serious concern caused by both climate change and an increase in energy
development infrastructure is a threat to water security in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Persistent organic pollutants created by
the energy industry also threaten Arctic communities, because they now
exist in the tissues of marine mammals which these communities hunt. Oil
leaks also pose a perennial threat. Thawing permafrost destabilizes the
ground, which not only threatens Arctic communities' infrastructure, but
also threatens the stability of energy industry infrastructure which
sits close to Arctic communities. Other hazards include deadly diseases
that can resurface after hundreds of years under permafrost. For
example, in 2016, a deadly outbreak of anthrax spontaneously broke out
among a community of local Yamal Siberians.43 Furthermore, the attitude
of the pilots contracted by CMS greatly contributed to the mission
creep. Pressure on pilots to deliver results was constant because of the
CMS practice of obfuscating contract lengths.44 The cause was thought to
be a rotting reindeer carcass underground that transmitted the disease
to grazing herds. [[There are many other organisms buried under
permafrost close to the surface. The hazards that could be unearthed due
to continually thawing permafrost are unknown, but have the potential to
threaten human security across the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}.45

radically alter habitats; tropical plants, for example, are now found
further and further north. Meanwhile, [[abnormally destructive events

landscapes.]{.underline}]{.mark} As habitats rapidly change, wildlife
are forced to move or face annihilation. According to one 2020 study,
[[one-third of all animal and plant species on Earth could face

**Ocean collapse causes extinction**

School of Law, "Taking Steps Toward Marine Wilderness Protection",

Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine
ecosystems also exist, just as they do for terrestrial ecosystems, but
these arguments have thus far rarely been raised in political debates.
For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically
valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs
protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations,
services worth more than ten times the reefs\' value for food
production. 856 Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive
ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. 857 More
generally, [[\"ocean ecosystems play a major role in the global
geochemical cycling of all the elements that represent the basic
building blocks of living organisms, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but necessary
elements.\"]{.underline}]{.mark} 858 [[In a very real and direct
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, [[human degradation of marine
ecosystems impairs the planet\'s ability to support
life]{.underline}.]{.mark} Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to
maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems. Current evidence shows
that, in general, an ecosystem\'s ability to keep functioning in the
face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity,
\"indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable.\" 859 Coral
reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity.
\[\*265\] Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and
degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral
reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the
ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is
also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong
effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. 860 Thus, maintaining
and restoring the biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to
maintaining and restoring the ecosystem services that they provide.
Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated
in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska. 861 Similar calculations could derive preservation values for
marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value
equivalents, should not be \"the sole or even primary justification for
conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have
considerable force and merit.\" 862 At the forefront of such arguments
should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about
the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. The United
States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it
was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now
know that such harm is occurring - even though we are not completely
sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like
the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers
to admit that most of the time we really do not know what we are doing
to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we
can - especially when the United States has within its territory
relatively pristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world.
[[We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: if we
kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take most of the biosphere
with us]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Black Sea is almost dead, 863 its
once-complex and productive ecosystem almost entirely replaced by a
monoculture of comb jellies, \"starving out fish and dolphins, emptying
fishermen\'s nets, and converting the web of life into brainless,
wraith-like blobs of jelly.\" 864 More importantly, the Black Sea is not
necessarily unique.

### Marine Ecosystems Turn - Extension

#### Every offshore oil spill began with a new lease. Oil spills cause long term environmental and economic devastation. Its not worth the risk to ecosystems.

Melissa **Denchak** Contributor Feb 20 **2025** The Fight to Keep Oil
and Gas Rigs Out of Our Waters. For Good.
<https://www.nrdc.org/stories/fight-keep-oil-and-gas-rigs-out-our-waters-good>

In January 1969, an oil spill from an offshore drilling platform off
California's Santa Barbara County coast spewed an estimated three
million gallons of crude, swiftly turning a 35-mile stretch of idyllic
Pacific shoreline into a devastating oil slick. The oil killed thousands
of seabirds, poisoned seals and dolphins, and destroyed delicate marine
habitats. It was an unprecedented event in American history. Yet ensuing
decades would see offshore oil spills even bigger in scale. Oil still
lingers today from the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill in the waters of
Alaska's Prince William Sound, and impacts from the [BP Deepwater
Horizon](https://www.nrdc.org/node/137) [offshore drilling
disaster](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-deep-were-impacts-bp-oil-disaster)
in 2010 topped both incidents, killing 11 workers and spreading millions
of gallons of oil throughout the Gulf of Mexico. These catastrophes
garner big headlines---and for good reason: Dramatic in the short term,
[[oil spills spell long-term devastation for coastal communities,
ecosystems, and economies. But these disasters are only one way in which
offshore drilling wreaks havoc. The oil and gas industry's [routine
business practices](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/offshore-drilling-101)
imperil marine wildlife with deafening seismic airgun blasts, destroy
habitats, emit toxic by-products and high levels of greenhouse gases,
and lead to tens of thousands of smaller, less visible spills in U.S.
waters annually]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[More offshore drilling is not
worth the risks it poses to marine and coastal
ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as the people who rely on those
ecosystems," says NRDC fossil fuels policy advocate [Zanagee
Artis](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/zanagee-artis). And as lawmakers
consider whether---or in some cases, how fast---to auction off more of
our ocean to drilling, they must keep in mind a basic truth, Artis adds:
"[[Every offshore oil spill began with a lease sale." There remains no
easy fix for these spills. Even the most advanced cleanup efforts remove
only a fraction of the oil and use [hazardous
technologies](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/has-oil-spill-cleanup-improved-all)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And scientists are still evaluating the [health impacts of the oil

#### Numerous challenges with the viability and safety of Arctic drilling -- one of the last times we tried Shell had oil response equipment "crushed like a beer can" in tests

Despite these concerns, and after multiple delays due to the erratic
weather and failure to receive Coast Guard certification of its oil
spill response barge, Shell received approval from the Department of the
Interior to drill two preparatory wells in the Arctic Ocean last summer.
Though the two "top holes" were completed without incident, [[the
operations surrounding Shell's Arctic program were nothing short of a
disaster. The company twice lost control of its Arctic drilling rigs,
had its oil spill response equipment "crushed like a beer can" in tests
in Puget Sound, and was cited for multiple safety and environmental
violations]{.underline}]{.mark}---now the subject of an investigation
that the Coast Guard handed over to the Department of Justice to assess
potential civil or criminal charges. After watching Shell's string of
mishaps from the sidelines, Norway-based oil and gas company Statoil
said two weeks ago that it would consider walking away from its Arctic
offshore leases if exploration proves too risky and expensive. Tim
Dodson, [[Statoil's executive vice president of global exploration,
acknowledged the numerous challenges associated with Arctic offshore
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark} and reiterated his company's cautious
approach to exploration in the region, saying, "We've \[said\] we
wouldn't drill before 2015. Whether that means we drill in 2015, or
maybe not until 2016 or whether we'd drill at all, I think maybe the
jury's still a little bit out on that." [[Shell's multiple failures and
the concern expressed by fellow corporations illustrate how the current
level of risk in Arctic offshore drilling outweighs the potential
reward.]{.underline}]{.mark} The amount of time and money Shell has
invested so far is just a down payment on the massive investment that
would be required to build the infrastructure necessary to get the oil
to market and turn a profit on estimated reserves. This has led analysts
to wonder whether the current boom in production of natural gas and its
subsequent effect on energy prices will render Arctic offshore prospects
uneconomic in the near future. Nick Butler, former group vice president
of strategy and policy development at BP, wrote in the Financial Times
last September that regardless of Shell's investment, "[[No amount of
technical excellence can transform the economics of a project which is
at the outer limit of commercial viability]{.underline}]{.mark}." If
Shell were to abandon its Arctic project, Butler continues, it "would
not be an admission of technical failure, nor an act of submission to
the environmentalists. It would be a statement of commercial common
sense."

drilling and concluded that Shell's "dedicated capabilities do not
completely mitigate some of the environmental and logistical risks

#### Drilling in the Arctic means an oil spill is inevitable -- the conditions make it nearly impossible to respond, so it would cause a significant environmental catastrophe

[[Increased energy exploration and extraction poses risks to
environmental and human security. The dangers of energy development in
the Arctic are particularly consequential]{.underline}]{.mark} compared
to anywhere else in the world due to several reasons: [[the physical
makeup of the Arctic makes it extremely difficult for a rapid response
to an oil spill]{.underline}]{.mark}; the lack of infrastructure in the
Arctic - few permanent structures, runways, and roads - makes the Arctic
hard to access; and thawing permafrost poses challenges to the stable
ground. The main danger posed by increased energy exploration and
extraction in the Arctic is the chance of an oil spill. Most people
today remember the environmental catastrophe caused by the 2010
Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which released an estimated 4 million
barrels (over 168 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in
2010.23 The accident had a spill-over effect into Arctic policy
discussions: it prompted the National Commission for reviewing the
Deepwater spill to reassess the implications of deep-water drilling in
other sensitive environments, looking specifically to the Alaskan Arctic
coast.24 [[U.S. government authorities estimate that an oil spill off of
Alaska's Arctic coast is about 30 - 50 percent likely: the question is
not if an oil spill will occur in the Arctic, but
when]{.underline}]{.mark} it will occur.25 [[The estimated maximum
blowout volume of a spill in the Arctic is 1.3 million
barrels]{.underline}]{.mark} of oil (58 million gallons).26 The largest
spill to date in U.S. Arctic waters is the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in
Alaska which released 11 million gallons of crude oil.27 Both the Exxon
Valdez spill and the Deepwater Horizon spill can help predict what an
oil spill in the Arctic might look like. However, the potential scale of
a spill is estimated to be far larger than the Exxon Valdez spill. The
key difference with Deepwater Horizon is the environment: the Deepwater
Horizon Commission's report explicitly stated that the clean- up
techniques used to remedy the Deepwater Horizon spill would not work in
Arctic conditions.28 Compared to other regions, [[the 'response
gap]{.underline}]{.mark},' a "period of time in which oil spill response
activities [[would be unsafe or infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}," is
thought to be significantly higher in the Arctic.29 [[This is primarily
due to the remoteness of the Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark} the lack of
infrastructure (the closest Coast Guard airstrip is 1,000 miles from the
northernmost point of Alaska, and the closest major port is 1,300
miles), lack of weather prediction capabilities, and lack of available
vessels for proper spillage procedures.30 Data on minor oil spills in
Alaska's Aleutian Islands over the past 20 years present evidence that,
"no oil has been recovered during events where attempts have been made
by the responsible parties or government agencies, and that in many
cases, weather and other conditions have prevented any response at
all.\"31 Other factors also increase the chances of a major oil spill
and will complicate clean-up, in addition to the difficulties of
implementing a rapid response. [[Thawing permafrost in the Arctic poses
challenges to the stability of the ground, and therefore destabilizes
the extraction infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} on it.32 Because
[[the Arctic Ocean does not experience the same circulation as other
bodies of water, oil sitting atop the water's surface tends to travel
less]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic Ocean is also far shallower than
other oceans, which slows down dissipation.33 In addition, [[the
physical makeup of the Arctic Ocean provides spaces for oil to become
trapped]{.underline}]{.mark}, either under the ice sheet itself or
within the jagged landscape. Another factor that would make clean-up
difficult is the lack of daylight hours for work to take place during
the winter parts of the year. [[Practically speaking, in case of a major
oil spill, it is unlikely that any oil will be removed from the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}.

praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium]{.underline}. These minerals are

However, it's worth noting that [lead, [iron,]{.mark} nickel, zinc,
[gold]{.mark}, [silver, coal]{.mark}, mica, precious stones [and
construction minerals]{.mark} such as sand, gravel and crushed rock are
also believed to be present in significant quantities.]{.underline} The
[[estimated value of]{.mark} minerals in Arctic Russia stands at
[\$]{.mark}US1.5--[2 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Geological
Survey of Norway concluded that the subsurface of the Kola Peninsula
contains a ['remarkable' abundance of various minerals.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the Canadian Shield, which extends through eastern and
central Canada from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, features
high-grade metamorphic rocks that hold large reserves of copper, gold,
lead, molybdenum and uranium. In Greenland, melting ice is exposing
mineral belts that are highly likely to contain gold, nickel,
platinum-group elements, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds and
rare earth elements. [[Most]{.mark} of the known resources [are]{.mark}
located [within the boundaries of]{.mark} Arctic [nation states]{.mark},
making their ownership and rights to any exploitation politically
uncontroversial and beyond challenge.]{.underline} 'The land masses are
pretty much clearly defined among the Arctic Eight and their exclusive
economic zones,' says Boulègue. 'On land and within their continental
shelves, there is no scramble for resources.' Arctic wildlife In January
this year, the Biden administration revoked an executive order
instigated by Donald Trump in 2017 that attempted to open up US Arctic
waters to new drilling activities. 'Oil and gas drilling contributes to
climate change and threatens wildlife and communities. The court's
decision to uphold the ban on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean
gets us one step closer to permanent protection. We need to drill less,
not more,' says Margaret Williams, managing director of the WWF-US
Arctic programme. The vast size, remote location and extreme weather
conditions -- combined with the complete lack of infrastructure for
responding to oil spills -- make drilling in the Arctic Ocean extremely
dangerous. WWF-US describes the international capability to respond to
emergencies and oil spills as severely limited. 'Broken ice and other
severe weather conditions in the Arctic would make any large oil spill
or well blowout catastrophic for the amazing life in the area,' Williams
adds. Spills aren't just a theoretical threat. In 2020, a storage tank
near Norilsk in Russia sank, probably as a result of melting permafrost,
and 17,500 tonnes of oil leaked into rivers, a previously pristine lake
and the Arctic Ocean. Expansion of oil and gas drilling could also be
extremely damaging for polar bears. Not only would direct contact with
spilled oil kill them, but an invisible threat could persist for years,
as toxic substances lingering in ice or seawater may have an impact on
the entire Arctic ecosystem. The use of underwater seismic testing could
also affect communication between beluga whales, other cetaceans and
pinnipeds. [[Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} the melting
[[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and the remaining space are [intensely

Emergence of non-military interests

[[The broadening of state interests in the Far
North]{.underline}]{.mark} to include economic interests
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[part of the reason that the Arctic
has resisted this trend towards tactical
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Climate warming has already made
possible new polar shipping lanes and undersea resource extraction. In
February 2021, a Russian gas tanker completed an experimental trip of
the Northern Sea Route. This voyage, which was previously impossible
even in the summer months, "tak\[es\] Russia one step closer to its goal
of year-round commercial navigation through the warming Arctic" (Odynova
2021). Amidst [[newly discovered oil deposits in the Norwegian Arctic,
Norway has significantly expanded]{.underline}]{.mark} its offshore
[[commercial licensing]{.underline}]{.mark} rounds. Because of
geopolitical pressures and Norway's economic dependence on oil exports,
industry insiders argue that "there is de facto no alternative to
entering the Arctic" else Norway risks being left behind in the global
scramble for undersea resources (Morgunova 2020, 72-3). These are just a
few examples of the economic activity that is already escalating in the
Far North. With further ice melt poised to exacerbate these trends,
[[Arctic states now have an economic incentive to keep tabs on their
rivals]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an [[undertaking]{.underline}]{.mark}
that requires much [[more extensive monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} than
awareness of likely ICBM routes.

Improved electronic surveillance capabilities are certainly also a
contributor. While technology-enabled monitoring in other parts of the
world is limited by dense urban settings (Denece 2014, 31), the Arctic
landscape facilitates the collection of huge packets of data. At that
scale, strategic intelligence is more viable than tactical intelligence
--- analysts are tasked not with finding a needle in a haystack but
searching for trends or anomalies in the haystack as a whole (Regens
2019, 674). [[This potent combination of technology and geopolitical
interests creates an incentive]{.underline}]{.mark} for states [[to
invest in Arctic surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} assets capable of
near-constant, all-domain awareness, a marked departure from World War
II or Cold War capabilities.

[[There is one oil development project that was pending in federal
Arctic waters, but it is now stalled and possibly dead: a Beaufort Sea
field called Liberty]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Liberty project, with 150
million barrels of oil, was being pursued by Hilcorp. But Biden
administration regulators last month rejected Hilcorp's request for
extra time to pursue a new development concept. It would have been the
12th extension for leases that were originally sold decades ago and that
Hilcorp's predecessor, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., in the early 2000s
tried to develop into a producing field. [[Hilcorp]{.underline}]{.mark},
in its application for a "suspension of production" approval that
effectively halts lease development deadlines, [[said it is dropping its
plan to build an artificial island as the new drill site. Instead, it is
seeking to return to a plan to use ultra-extended-reach wells to drill
from existing land. BP had tried that concept but found it
unfeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}. One Alaska oil and gas expert said
Hilcorp's reversion to the BP plan is puzzling. "I don't know why they
walked away from the island," said Mark Myers, a former commissioner of
the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, former director of the
Alaska Division of Oil and Gas and director of the U.S. Geological
Survey. Myers was commenting after the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement denied Hilcorp's request but before Trump
issued his executive orders. Myers, who is now a member of the U.S.
Arctic Research Commission, said [[geology is one reason why the BP plan
did not work]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[There is a layer of shale, a
formation called Kingak, that poses extraordinary challenges to any
directional drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said. Myers said the
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the federal agency that
denied Hilcorp's extension request, was probably justified in that
decision. "It looks to me like Hilcorp could have been more diligent,
and BSEE got fed up," he said. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management now
lists the Liberty leases as "expired." A copy of the two-volume 2001
draft environmental impact statement on the BP\'s first development plan
for the Liberty field is seen on a shelf on April 6, 2023, at the Alaska

#### The collective of Trump administration policies can't grow the economy while emphasizing drilling, especially due to downward pressure on oil prices

Tomi **Kilgore** Published: April 25, **2025** at 8:36 a.m. ET Don't
count on 'drill, baby, drill,' Schlumberger says
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-count-on-drill-baby-drill-schlumberger-says-6cea0fff

Upstream refers to exploration and production, or pulling oil and gas
out of the ground. [[Schlumberger's outlook appears to run counter to
the Trump administration's "drill, baby, drill" call to boost production
and lower oil prices. The problem is that the lower prices
go]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[as uncertainties surrounding tariffs and
the global economy reduce demand]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[drilling
becomes less profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}. The stock SLB -0.72% ,
which dropped 2% in premarket trading, has tumbled 19.8%
[[since]{.mark}]{.underline} President Donald [[Trump's
inauguration]{.underline}]{.mark} through Thursday. [[Schlumberger's
stock has shed 8.9% in 2025]{.underline}]{.mark} through Thursday, while
the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE +0.12% has slipped 3.6% and the
S&P 500 index SPX +0.83% has slid 6.8%. [[Meanwhile, crude-oil
futures]{.underline}]{.mark} CL.1 -0.82% , which [[were
down]{.underline}]{.mark} 1.2% at \$62.05 in recent trading, have also
dropped 19.8% since the inauguration. For the quarter to March 31,
Schlumberger reported net income that dropped 25.4% from the same period
a year ago to \$797 million. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes
nonrecurring items, fell to 72 cents from 92 cents per share, missing
the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of 73 cents. [[That
marked the company's first quarterly bottom-line miss in at least five
years]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to available FactSet data back to
April 2020.

#### Plan harms economy -- encourages speculators and investors to purchase leases that won't produce more resources

[Tristan **Baurick**](https://grist.org/author/tristan-baurick/)
Regional Reporter, Louisiana Jan 31 **2025** Trump wants more drilling,
but the oil market is already saturated
https://grist.org/energy/trump-wants-more-drilling-but-the-oil-market-is-already-saturated/

[[Leases have been sold too quickly and cheaply in recent
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a 2021 report by the U.S.
Department of the Interior, which oversees BOEM. [[This fast and loose
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} "shortchanges taxpayers" and [[encourages
"speculators to purchase leases with the intent of waiting for increases
in resource prices, adding assets to their balance sheets, or even
reselling leases at profit rather than attempting to produce oil or
gas,]{.underline}]{.mark}" the report said. "[[More leases may make the
companies look good]{.underline}]{.mark}, on paper, [[to
investors]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Tom Pelton, communications
director for the Environmental Integrity Project, an environmental
watchdog group. "[[But they won't]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily even
[[produce more oil and gas]{.underline}]{.mark}. And they certainly will
not be good for the climate or clean water."

'**Energy dominance' not profitable or possible -- oil is an already
saturated market**

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-has-called-for-u-s-energy-dominance-but-is-likely-to-hit-real-world-limits

Still, "[[market dynamics will always be the key" for any potential
increase in energy production]{.underline}]{.mark}, Meyer said.
[[Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's
Center on Global Energy Policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[called energy
dominance a "deliberately vague concept]{.underline}]{.mark}," but said,
"[[It's hard to see how (Trump) can push more oil into an already
saturated marke]{.underline}]{.mark}t." [[Trump has promised to bring
gasoline prices below \$2 a gallon, but experts call that highly
unlikely, since crude oil prices would need to drop dramatically to
achieve that goal]{.underline}]{.mark}. Gas prices averaged \$3.07
nationally as of Wednesday, down from \$3.25 a year ago.

#### Oil and gas extraction won't benefit the economy -- it would take years for the resources to enter production and oil/gas demand will decrease over time

Jan **Dusik** 4 April **2022** Arctic oil and gas: the wrong solution to
the world's energy crisis
https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/opinions/arctic-oil-and-gas-the-wrong-solution-to-the-worlds-energy-crisis/153001

[[An expansion of oil and gas extraction is also economically
misguided]{.underline}]{.mark}. Energy prices have indeed risen sharply
in response to a supply shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The sharp rise in prices is likely to be a short-term response to the
invasion of Ukraine, and prices are predicted to return to levels lower
than before the invasion. If new projects are given the go-ahead based
on current oil prices, investors could easily see their investments
stranded. In addition, [[most energy analysts believe that oil and gas
demand is in decline as the world acts in response to climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, meaning that any [[new oil or gas
extraction would ultimately be for nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's
because [[it takes an average of 16 years before newly discovered
resources can enter production]{.underline}]{.mark}, and so [[any new
finds would only be coming on stream once the energy transition was well
underway]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, the current crisis is likely to
accelerate this transition, as energy security considerations join
concerns about climate change as strong reasons to rapidly move beyond
fossil fuels.

#### Offshore drilling locks us into outdated energy paradigm, preventing clean energy transition that will boost growth.

Angelo **Villagomez**, Aug 20 **2024** "Project 2025's Plan to 'Drill,
Baby, Drill' Threatens Ocean Health and Economic Stability
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025s-plan-to-drill-baby-drill-threatens-ocean-health-and-economic-stability/

[[The economic argument for offshore drilling often centers on jobs and
the notion of "energy dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}." However, [[this
is a false narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} that overlooks the broader
impacts. [[Any small economic gains are offset by the huge environmental
costs of increased oil and gas production]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Coastal communities, which rely heavily on tourism and fishing, are
particularly vulnerable.]{.underline}]{.mark} An oil spill can devastate
local economies for years as beaches become polluted and [fish stocks

nearly \$1 billion in losses. [[Furthermore, the focus on fossil fuels
diverts investment away from renewable energy sources, which are not
only more sustainable but also [increasingly
cost-effective](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/offshore-wind-can-lower-energy-prices-and-beat-out-oil-and-gas/)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
By [[doubling down on offshore drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}, Project
2025 [[risks locking the United States into an outdated energy paradigm,
hindering the transition to a green economy. This could have long-term
economic repercussions as other nations forge ahead with clean energy
innovations and capture the associated economic
benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}. Notably, these burdens are
[disproportionately carried by vulnerable
communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/12/08/biden-harris-administration-unveils-first-ever-strategy-to-advance-environmental-justice-for-communities-that-rely-on-the-ocean-and-marine-resources/)---including

offshore drilling is unpopular in key Republican states

[[Compared to highly productive oil and gas areas on
land]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the Permian Basin in West Texas and
New Mexico and the Marcellus and Utica formations in Pennsylvania and
Ohio, [[offshore wells take more time to bring online and are typically
more expensive.]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[There are a lot of opportunities
onshore]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Anthony Kovscek, a professor of
petroleum engineering at Stanford University. "[[The lead times for
those are pretty short, and the amount of capital you need is not that
big.]{.underline}]{.mark} Whereas, [[if you're offshore, lead times are
a lot longer and the capital outlays are a lot
bigger."]{.underline}]{.mark}

relations campaigns aimed at convincing people that their
[opportunism](https://www.taxpayer.net/energy-natural-resources/dont-be-fooled-oil-and-gas-interests-are-exploiting-conflict-in-ukraine/)

already the world's [largest

gas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Domestic [oil
production](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/crude-oil-production#:~:text=Crude%20Oil%20Production%20in%20the%20United%20States%20averaged%207606.50%20BBL,1K%20in%20September%20of%202008.)
is at 90 percent of America's all-time, pre-pandemic high, and the
United States is producing more than twice as many barrels of oil per
day as it produced in 2008. But [[energy independence won't be found at
the bottom of a well.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[We can never be energy
independent while we rely on a fuel source that is both controlled by
the global market and highly susceptible to international conflict and
manipulation by autocratic regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fossil fuel
industry's [wish
list](https://twitter.com/APIenergy/status/1496670649909194761)---more
taxpayer subsidies, more land opened for dirty drilling, and fewer

with the price of gas today. But [[granting them free rein will lock the
United States into decades of higher and more volatile energy prices;
higher toxic emissions; and greater climate

fossil fuels.

#### Energy independence is a myth -- we import fossil fuels due to infrastructure preferences and pricing, reducing reliance is the best step to independence.

ARIANNA **SKIBELL** 04/29/**2024** 05:59 PM EDT Energy independence is a
myth. Candidates don't care.
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/04/29/energy-independence-is-a-myth-candidates-dont-care-00154959

[[Presidents love to promise energy independence]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Former President Donald Trump claimed at a recent rally that the U.S.
"was energy independent three years ago" during his administration.
President Joe Biden has often invoked the term as well --- and his
campaign told POLITICO's E&E News that the U.S. is "closer to energy
independence" now than it has been in decades. [[It's been the
universal, perpetually repeated rallying cry for every president since
the 1973 Arab oil embargo]{.underline}]{.mark}. But energy experts
caution that [[while the political slogan may be simple, becoming a
truly energy independent country is not]{.underline}]{.mark}, writes
Scott Waldman. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, it depends on how you define
the term. [[If energy independence means the country is producing more
energy than it consumes, then]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[leaders have
achieved it]{.underline}]{.mark}. While Biden rarely talks up his
efforts to produce oil and natural gas, the nation's output under his
leadership continues to smash records. And starting under Trump's
tenure, the U.S. began annually producing "more crude oil than any
country, ever," according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration
--- though even that achievement stemmed from the fracking boom that
began during the George W. Bush administration and roared to life under
President Barack Obama. [[Still, the nation has continued to import
foreign fuels as well. So if energy independence means no imports, then
neither president has done it]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to that
definition, the country hasn't been energy independent for more than 75
years. That's in part because [[the oil the U.S. produces isn't the oil
the country's infrastructure prefers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The
nation's refineries were largely built before the U.S. fracking boom and
are designed to process heavier crude oil typically found in Russia and
the Middle East. The lighter stuff found in the U.S. is often cheaper to
export]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[And even if a country produces more than
it consumes, oil is part of a global market.]{.underline}]{.mark} That
means the fuel will still be exposed to international supply and demand
disruptions that affect global prices, said Harrison Fell at North
Carolina State University. Energy produced from solar rays and wind,
however, is not vulnerable to global price shocks. So [[reducing the
nation's reliance on fossil fuels is a key, and often overlooked, step
toward self-sufficiency]{.underline}]{.mark}, Fell said.

even longer]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it takes at least two to three

### Econ defense

#### No Econ [Impact]{.underline}. 

**Walt 20** -- Stephen M, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global Depression
Trigger Another World War?", Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
05-13-2020

One familiar argument is [the]{.underline} so-called
**[[diversionary]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or "scapegoat") [theory of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [suggests]{.underline} that
[leaders]{.underline} who are worried about their popularity at home
[will]{.underline} try to **[divert attention]{.underline}** from their
failures [by **provoking a crisis**]{.underline} with a foreign power
and maybe even using force against it. Drawing on this logic,
[some]{.underline} Americans now [worry]{.underline} that President
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [will decide to **attack**]{.underline} a
country like [**Iran** or **Venezuela**]{.underline} in the run-up to
the presidential election and especially if he thinks he's likely to
lose. [This]{.underline} outcome [[strikes me as **unlikely**, even if
one ignores]{.mark} the **logical** and **[empirical flaws]{.mark}** in
the theory **itself**. War is **always a gamble**, and should things go
**badly**---even a **little bit**---it would **hammer the last nail** in
the **coffin** of **Trump's declining fortunes**]{.underline}. Moreover,
none of the countries Trump might consider going after pose an imminent
threat to U.S. security, and even [his **staunchest supporters** may
wonder why he is **wasting time** and **money** going after Iran or
Venezuela]{.underline} at a moment [when **thousands of Americans** are
**dying preventable deaths**]{.underline} at home. [Even a successful
military action won't **put Americans back to work**]{.underline},
[create]{.underline} the sort of **[testing-and-tracing]{.underline}**
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already, [or **hasten**]{.underline} the development [of a
**vaccine**]{.underline}. [The **same logic** is likely to guide the
decisions of **other world leaders** too.]{.underline} Another familiar
folk theory is "military Keynesianism." War generates a lot of economic
demand, and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of the
doldrums and back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious
case in point here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy
finally escape the quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are
convinced that great powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or
the arms industry) happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument,
and they might worry that governments looking at bleak economic
forecasts will try to restart their economies through some sort of
military adventure. I doubt it. [It takes a **really big war** to
generate a **significant stimulus**]{.underline}, and [[it is hard to
imagine]{.mark} any country launching [a]{.mark} **[large-scale
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}---with all its attendant risks---at a moment
[[when **debt levels** are]{.mark} **already
[soaring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More importantly, [[there are
lots]{.mark} of **[easier]{.mark}** and more **direct [ways]{.mark}**
[to **stimulate the economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}---infrastructure
spending, unemployment insurance, even "helicopter payments"---and
[**launching a war** has to be one of the least **efficient methods
available**]{.underline}. The threat of war usually spooks investors
too, which any politician with their eye on the stock market would be
loath to do. Economic [[downturns can encourage war in]{.mark} some
**[special circumstances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially when a war
would enable a country facing severe hardships to capture something of
immediate and significant value. Saddam Hussein's decision to seize
Kuwait in 1990 fits this model perfectly: The Iraqi economy was in
terrible shape after its long war with Iran; unemployment was
threatening Saddam's domestic position; Kuwait's vast oil riches were a
considerable prize; and seizing the lightly armed emirate was
exceedingly easy to do. Iraq also owed Kuwait a lot of money, and a
hostile takeover by Baghdad would wipe those debts off the books
overnight. In this case, Iraq's parlous economic condition clearly made
war more likely. Yet [I cannot think of **any country** in **similar
circumstances today**. Now is **hardly the time** for **Russia** to try
to **grab**]{.underline} more of **[Ukraine]{.underline}**---[if it even
**wanted** to]{.underline}---[or for China to **make a play for
Taiwan**]{.underline}, [because the **costs** of doing so would
**clearly outweigh the economic benefits**]{.underline}. [Even
conquering an **oil-rich country**]{.underline}---the sort of greedy
acquisitiveness that Trump occasionally hints at---[**doesn't look
attractive** when there's a **vast glut on the market**]{.underline}. I
might be worried if some weak and defenseless country somehow came to
possess the entire global stock of a successful coronavirus vaccine, but
that scenario is not even remotely possible. If one takes a longer-term
perspective, however, a sustained economic depression could make war
more likely by strengthening fascist or xenophobic political movements,
fueling protectionism and hypernationalism, and making it more difficult
for countries to reach mutually acceptable bargains with each other. The
history of the 1930s shows where such trends can lead, although the
economic effects of the Depression are hardly the only reason world
politics took such a deadly turn in the 1930s. Nationalism, xenophobia,
and authoritarian rule were making a comeback well before COVID-19
struck, but the economic misery now occurring in every corner of the
world could intensify these trends and leave us in a more war-prone
condition when fear of the virus has diminished. **[On
balance]{.underline}**, however, [I do not think that even]{.underline}
the **[extraordinary economic conditions]{.underline}** we are
witnessing today are going to [have **much impact** on the **likelihood
of war**]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions **were** a
**powerful cause of war**, there would be a **lot more** of the
**latter**]{.underline}. To take one example, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has suffered
**40**]{.mark} **or more [recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
country was founded, [[yet]{.mark} it has [fought]{.mark} perhaps
[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}, most of them **[unrelated
to]{.mark} the state of [the economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To
paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock
market, [if recessions were a **powerful cause of war,** they would have
predicted "**nine out of the last five** (or fewer)."]{.underline}
Second, [[states **do not start wars** unless they believe they will win
a **quick** and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[cheap
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As John Mearsheimer showed in his
classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders **avoid** war
when they are convinced it will be **long, bloody, costly**, and
**uncertain**]{.underline}. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. [**Europe** went
to war in **1914**]{.underline} [with each side believing it would win a
**rapid and easy victory**]{.underline}, and Nazi Germany developed the
strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as quickly and
cheaply as possible. [**Iraq** attacked **Iran** in 1980]{.underline}
[because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in **disarray** and
would be **easy to defeat**]{.underline}, and George W. [Bush **invaded
Iraq** in 2003 convinced the war would be **short, successful**, and
**pay for itself.** The fact that each of these leaders **miscalculated
badly** does not alter the **main point**: **No matter** what a
country's **economic condition** might be, its leaders **will not go to
war** unless they think they can do so **quickly, cheaply**, and with a
**reasonable probability of success.**]{.underline} Third, and most
important, [[the]{.mark} primary [**motivation** for]{.mark} most [wars
is]{.mark} the desire for **[security]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[not
**economic gain**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, the odds of war
increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that
"[**every war** between **Great Powers**]{.underline} \[between 1848 and
1918\] ... [started as a **preventive** war, not as a **war of
conquest**]{.underline}," and [that **remains true**]{.underline} of
most wars fought since then. The bottom line: **[Economic
conditions]{.underline}** (i.e., a depression) may affect the broader
political environment in which decisions for war or peace are made, but
they [are only **one factor among many** and **rarely** the most
significant]{.underline}. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has large,
lasting, and negative effects on the world economy---as seems quite
likely---it is not likely to affect the probability of war very much,
especially in the short term. To be sure, I can't rule out another
powerful cause of war---stupidity---especially when it is so much in
evidence in some quarters these days. So there is no guarantee that we
won't see misguided leaders stumbling into another foolish bloodletting.
But given that it's hard to find any rays of sunshine at this particular
moment in history, I'm going to hope I'm right about this one.

assume]{.mark}** that [**wars occur** at **any particular**]{.mark}
[**stage**]{.mark} of the business cycle]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[**[although]{.mark}** the domestic economic [problems in]{.mark} the
crisis/[recession]{.mark}/depression period [break out]{.mark} and
become prominent [in]{.mark} a **[short time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
fact, [**such [challenge exists]{.mark}** [at **all stages**]{.mark} of
the business **cycle**]{.underline}. When countries cannot manage to
solve these problems through conventional approaches, including fiscal
and monetary policies, they may resort to military expansion to achieve
their goals, a theory known as Lateral Pressure. \[13\] Under such
circumstances, even countries in the period of economic expansion are
facing downward pressure on the economy and may try to solve the problem
through expansion. On the other hand, although the resources required
for foreign wars are huge for countries in economic depression, the
[[**decision to wage wars** **depends**]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} the
[**consideration** of]{.mark} the **[gain and loss of
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even during depression, governments can
raise funding for war by issuing bonds. Argentina, for example, was
mired in economic stagflation before the war on the Malvinas islands
(also known as the Falkland islands in the UK). In fact, many
governments would dramatically increase their expenditure to stimulate
the economy during the recession, and economically war is the same as
these policies, so the claim that a depressed economy cannot support a
war is unfounded. In addition, during the crisis period of the business
cycle, which is the early stage of the economic downturn, despite the
economic crisis and potential depression, the country still retains the
ability to start wars based on its economic and military power. Based on
the above understanding, [[war]{.mark} has [the conditions and reasons
for]{.mark} its [outbreak in all stages of the]{.mark} business
[cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, [[the economic origin for]{.mark} the outbreak of [war is
**downward pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the economy rather than
optimism or competition for monopoly capital, [[which **may exist
during**]{.underline}]{.mark} economic recession or economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is due to a fact that
[**[during]{.mark}** economic **[prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[people are also **worried** about]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic
**[[recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blainey pointed out that wars
often occur in the economic upturn, which is caused by the optimism in
people\'s mind \[14\], that is, the confidence to prevail. This
interpretation linking optimism and war ignores the strength contrast
between the warring parties. Not all wars are equally comprehensive, and
there have always been wars of unequal strength. In such a war, one of
the parties tends to have an absolute advantage, so the expectation of
the outcome of the war is not directly related to the economic situation
of the country. Optimism is not a major factor leading to war, but may
somewhat serve as stimulation. In addition, Lenin attributed the war to
competition between monopoly capital. This theory may seem plausible,
but its scope of application is obviously too narrow. Lenin\'s theory of
imperialism is only applicable to developed capitalist countries in the
late stage of the development capitalism, but in reality, many wars take
place among developing countries whose economies are still at their
beginning stages. Therefore, the theory centered on competition among
monopoly capital cannot explain most foreign wars. Moreover, even wars
that occur during periods of economic expansion are likely to result
from the potential expectation of economic recession, the \"limits of
growth\" \[15\] faced during prosperity --- a potential deficiency of
market demand. So the downward pressure on the economy is the cause of
war.

#### Diversionary war is [false]{.underline}

"Diversionary cheap talk: economic conditions and US foreign policy
rhetoric, 1945-2010", International Interactions, Volume 46, Issue 2,

There is a large literature on diversionary conflict in international
relations, but it focuses on material conflicts like militarized
interstate disputes rather than foreign policy rhetoric. It is based in
social identity theory, which suggests that leaders can increase ingroup
affinity by making intergroup distinctions more salient (Coser 1956;
Simmel 1955; Tajfel and Turner 1979). A recent review concludes that
**[though the internal logic of [diversionary]{.mark} conflict is
"compelling and theoretically well supported," the empirical
[evi]{.mark}dence [is]{.mark} "decidedly [mixed]{.mark}"]{.underline}**
(Baum and Philip 2008, 48). **[Several studies find evidence of
diversionary aggression in US foreign policy]{.underline}** (Clark 2003;
DeRouen 2000; DeRouen and Peake 2002; Fordham 1998a,b; Hess and
Orphanides 1995; Howell and Pevehouse 2005; James and Hristoulas 1994;
James and Oneal 1991; Levy 1989a, 1989b; Clifton and Bickers 1992;
Ostrom and Job 1986) and elsewhere (Bennett 2000; Dassel and Reinhardt
1999; Davies 2002; Enterline and Gleditsch 2000; Gelpi 1997; Heldt 1999;
Lebow 1981; Mansfield and Snyder 1995; Oneal and Tir 2006; Russett 1990;
Sobek 2007; Tir 2010). **[Yet skeptics have amassed opposing
evidence]{.underline}** (Chiozza and Goemans 2003, 2004; Foster and
Palmer 2006; Gowa 1998; Johnston 1998; Leeds and Davis 1997; Lian and
Oneal 1993; Meernik 2004, 2000; Meernik and Waterman 1996; Moore and
Lanoue 2003; Potter 2007). **[Some [cases are hard to reconcile with
the]{.mark} theory]{.underline}**: in Britain, there were rallies in the
Falklands War and the Gulf War but not in other cases in which rallies
would be expected, such as the Korean, Suez, and Kosovo wars (Lai and
Reiter 2005). **[Some go so far as to call diversionary aggression a
"[myth]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Meernik and Waterman 1996).

Others have developed scope conditions for diversionary aggression. It
is more likely between states with pre-standing rivalries (Mitchell and
Prins 2004), when leaders are accountable (Carter 2018; Kisangani and
Pickering 2011), and in mature democracies, consolidating autocracies,
and transitional polities (Pickering and Kisangani 2005). It is less
likely when states avoid provoking troubled rivals (Clark 2003; Fordham
2005; Leeds and Davis 1997; Miller 1999). Diversion appears more likely
to produce a rally when supported by Security Council authorization
(Chapman 2011; Chapman and Reiter 2004), when the White House draws
attention to a dispute (Baker and Oneal 2001), and in conditions of
media attention, popular leadership, divided government, non election
years, and first terms (Colaresi 2007). Most recently, scholars have
asked whether diversion occurs outside democracies. They find some
autocracies, especially single party regimes, divert as well (Carter
2018; Pickering and Kisangani 2010).

This study extends the logic of diversionary conflict to foreign policy
rhetoric. **[There is surprisingly little research on
rhetoric]{.underline}** in international relations. The international
relations literature deems talk "cheap" (Fearon, 1995; Kydd, 2005). The
audience cost literature considers rhetoric meaningful, but only if it
invokes audience costs through explicit, public threats (Fearon, 1994;
Schultz, 2001; Smith, 1998; Tomz, 2007).

However, if foreign policy **[rhetoric]{.underline}** can activate
ingroup identity, then it **[may be appealing for leaders who wish to
improve their ratings without incurring the substantial risks of
militarized interstate disputes]{.underline}**. Domestic political
factors like low presidential approval ratings can lead otherwise
rational states to choose "suboptimal" foreign policies (Fearon 1998).
**[Diversionary rhetoric represents optimization inside the bounds of
domestic political constraints. While it might be "outlandish" for
presidents to engage in the impeachable exercise of diversionary
war]{.underline}** (Meernik and Waterman 1996), **[hostile foreign
policy rhetoric is far less outlandish a risk]{.underline}**.

To develop a theory of diversionary cheap talk, **[this]{.underline}**
paper **[draws upon research in [political psychology]{.mark} and
political communication. These literatures [find]{.mark} [persuasive
ev]{.mark}idence that]{.underline}** elite statements influence citizen
beliefs (Behr and Iyengar, 1985; Bennett, Lawrence and Livingston, 2006;
Brody, 1991; Cohen, 1995; Jentleson, 1992; Zaller and Chiu, 2000). I
draw on social identity theory to argue that **[diversionary [cheap
talk]{.mark}]{.underline}** highlights intergroup differences between
nations and **[[leads citizens to]{.mark} evaluate their [leader
favorably]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} When a leader criticizes
foreigners, she cues ingroup identity, which increases citizens' social
attachment to the nation and to herself as its leader. This is a
"solidarity mechanism," through which "\[c\]ollective group goals and
common group identity are highlighted, norms of groupbased altruism are
strengthened, punishment and rejection of defectors are increased, and
perceptions of the in-group and out-group are manipulated" (Halevy,
Bornstein and Sagiv, 2008, 405).

The theory generates observable implications about when leaders use
diversionary cheap talk and who they target. **[I follow the consensus
in the diversionary conflict literature in focusing on poor economic
conditions as the most important source of public disapproval for
leaders]{.underline}**. Low approval ratings limit leaders' ability to
advance their domestic agenda. Therefore, **[when the economy
deteriorates, leaders will criticize foreign nations to improve their
approval ratings and restore the political capital necessary for them to
govern]{.underline}**.

Second, a key observation from social identity theory is that the depth
of intergroup differences is important for group attachment. Therefore,
consonant with recent empirical findings in the diversionary conflict
literature (Mitchell and Prins 2004), I expect diversionary rhetoric to
be most effective when it targets threatening outgroups. In the context
of foreign policy, these are best represented by historical rivals.
Finally, I expect diversionary cheap talk to have differential partisan
effects. The solidarity mechanism suggests that because national
identity cues widen the tent of the political ingroup, diversionary
cheap talk should be most effective at boosting support among the
leader's nonpartisans: conservative voters for Democratic presidents,
and liberal voters for Republican presidents. However, this solidarity
mechanism is mediated by citizens' foreign policy preferences. Liberals
prefer more dovish foreign policy and hence might interpret diversionary
rhetoric from Republican presidents as too extreme. In contrast,
Republicans prefer more hawkish foreign policy and therefore are likely
to reward Democratic presidents for hostile rhetoric. Therefore,
diversionary rhetoric should be most powerful for Democratic presidents,
whose non-core voters are most likely to reward such rhetoric.

**[[I test]{.mark} these hypotheses with]{.underline}** the American
Diplomatic Dataset, an original record of **[over [50,000]{.mark} US
diplomatic [events]{.mark}]{.underline}** between 1945 and 2010 drawn
from New York Times articles on foreign affairs. I used tools from
computational social science to classify bilateral interstate
interactions into hundreds of specific types and four aggregate
categories: rhetorical cooperation, rhetorical conflict, material
cooperation, and material conflict. **[This is by far [the most]{.mark}
historically [extensive]{.mark} event [dataset]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
As such, **[it allows an exploration of US foreign policy behavior
[across]{.mark} a variety of [administrations and]{.mark} economic
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Crucially, **[the granularity of the
dataset]{.underline}** allows me to **[restrict attention to events
which the sitting US president initiated and directed at foreign state
actors.]{.underline}**

**[I find robust evidence of diversionary cheap talk in US foreign
policy]{.underline}**. First, I establish that **[US [presidents]{.mark}
face incentives [to divert verbally rather than materially]{.mark}:
while militarized interstate dispute initiation does not affect
presidential approval ratings, hostile foreign policy rhetoric is
associated with increased ratings]{.underline}**, especially for
Democratic presidents among Independent and Republican citizens.
Responding to this incentive, Democratic presidents between 1945 and
2010 typically diverted in the form of words, not deeds. Simulations
indicate that as the misery index of unemployment plus inflation varies
from its observed minimum to its observed maximum, predicted hostile
foreign policy rhetoric doubles. Throughout this study, estimates are
conservative: I operationalize conflict as events the United States
initiated, although findings are robust to a redefinition of conflict as
events the United States participated in. The **[rhetorical
statements]{.underline}** in the dataset **[are high profile and likely
to be noticed by the American public]{.underline}**: all appeared in the
headlines of the New York Times, the American newspaper of record in the
postWorld War II era.

This study contributes to existing scholarship in several ways. First,
it demonstrates that US foreign policy rhetoric may be shaped by
domestic economic conditions. International relations scholars should
therefore continue to focus more seriously on the communicative aspects
of foreign policy, and in particular its relationship to domestic
politics (Johnston 2001, 2008; Kurizaki 2007; Ramsay 2011; Sartori 2002,
2005; Trager 2010, 2011, 2016). The American Diplomacy Dataset will
enable researchers to further explore the communicative aspects of
foreign policy, and their relationships to material and economic
factors, in more detail than existing datasets permit.

Second, **[this]{.underline}** study **[contributes to the diversionary
conflict literature by showing that in many cases where diversionary
theory predicts conflict initiation, leaders may instead choose
rhetorical hostility]{.underline}**. In this sense, **[[leaders]{.mark}
may [have their cake and eat it too]{.mark}: [They benefit from]{.mark}
an ingroup [rally without]{.mark} inviting an international
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[mixed empirical findings in the
diversionary conflict literature may be]{.underline}** partly **[due to
the fact that existing scholarship considers only the most serious forms
of diversion like militarized interstate disputes]{.underline}**. It is
possible that **[a wide range of diversionary behavior takes place at
less extreme levels, such as]{.underline}** the **[rhetorical
hostility]{.underline}** documented in this paper.1

Like many believers, **[proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on faith alone]{.underline}**.41 **[There is precious little
evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline}** the **[pacific trends]{.underline}** that have swept
across the system. In fact, **[[the world remained equally
peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark}**, relatively speaking, **[[while the

**[[cut]{.mark} its [forces throughout the]{.mark} 19[90s]{.mark}, [as

essentially [unrelated to]{.mark} global
[stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple
correlations to support them, however. **[The theory's supporters have
never been able to explain adequately how precisely 5 percent of the
world's population could force peace on the other 95
percent]{.underline}**, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. **[Most states are quite free to go to
war without U.S. involvement but choose not to]{.underline}**. **[[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[can

[clear of most]{.mark} civil [wars]{.mark} and ethnic

interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal
**[violence in]{.underline}**, say, **[most of [Africa]{.mark} would be
unlikely to attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much
less intervention]{.underline}**. **[The continent [is]{.mark},
nevertheless, more [peaceful]{.mark} today than at any other time in its

**[[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in many]{.mark} such [places to
which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony simply [does not
extend.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Overall, [proponents of the **stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony
should keep in mind one of the most **basic observations** from
**cognitive psychology**]{.underline}: [**rarely** are our actions as
important to others' calculations as we **perceive them to
be**]{.underline}.44 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} so‐​called **[[egocentric
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [[suggests]{.mark} that although it may be **natural** for
[U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as crucial in the
maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is.]{.underline}

[The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple of
factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [[Americans have]{.mark}
long [been **exceptional** in their
**exceptionalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.45 [The short history of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can easily be read as an
almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, [has led
to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it is **morally,
culturally**, and **politically superior** to other, lesser
countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional state
would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the world.

Post--World War II [international institutions enshrine many of these
principles and provide the basis for what is called "[the
**l**]{.mark}iberal **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[o]{.mark}**rder."]{.underline} This "order" was [constructed to
ensure that the **political** and economic **fail- ures** that led to
two world wars in the twentieth century **would not
reoccur**.]{.underline} Its creators built institutions of global
governance to promote peaceful international cooperation, universal
human rights, free markets, and economic devel- opment. As Ana Palacio
(2017) aptly puts it, this liberal or- der opened "a moral umbrella over
the existing Westphalian state system\...creating a universal structure
within which national governments could collaborate in the pursuit of
progress." The liberal international order, as this narrative goes,
succeeded in freeing trade, preventing another world war, and spreading
prosperity to Western allies.

Many argue that these institutions must have a "leader" to survive. Why?
States participating in these organizations must relinquish some of
their sovereignty and sacrifice their own self-interest for the common
good if the rules demand it. But they look first to their own interests,
and only secon- darily to the common good. Also, unlike in domestic
soci- ety, there is no enforcement mechanism for liberal interna- tional
rules. Therefore, the creation and [maintenance of a liberal rule-based
global order would not have been possible without the **power** and
**willingness** of the strongest coun- try to use its **great might** to
create incentives for coopera- tion and make sacrifices for the **common
good**. That power was the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. It shaped
the rules of liberal institu- tions and agreed to pay the costs of
international cooper- ation by providing "side payments" to those who
believed their participation might not serve their interests. For ex-
ample, through a system of extended deterrence and al- liances, the
United States offered and paid for security to those who cooperated. And
by providing a reserve currency and an open economy, the United States
greased the wheels of a global economic system, even if that meant
suffering a trade deficit. As the story goes, the United States
sacrificed some of its own power for the common good.

Under the aegis of the United States, these rule-based in- stitutions
and their underlying norms and principles were the dominant form of
domestic and international gover- nance in the last half of the
twentieth century. Liberal democracy became the most widespread
political system in the world. To this day, no new institutions have
emerged to challenge those that have long constituted this "liberal in-
ternational order."

[[As the twenty-first century **opened**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[this vision of [the liberal]{.mark} world [order showed]{.mark}
**signs** of **[weakness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [For the **first time**
in a century, [a set of **large**]{.mark}, populous, increasingly
wealthy, and **[undemocratic]{.mark}** or fragile democratic
**[states]{.mark}** with governments **[hostile to
liberalism]{.mark}**---**China**, **Russia**, **Brazil**, and **India**
---were [becoming]{.mark} "**[great powers]{.mark}**" that [refused to
accept the]{.mark} **principles** of a **[l]{.mark}**iberal
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[o]{.mark}**rder.]{.underline} [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [had]{.mark} already [begun its
slow]{.mark} relative [economic decline]{.mark} with the growing
**economic strength** of **Europe** and **Japan**]{.underline}. Some
countries thus began to challenge the Western conception of order based
on the primacy of the United States and liberal post--World War II
rules. [Now the liberal hegemon had lost much of its power and
willingness to lead. [China's **growing power**]{.mark} and ambition in
**Asia**; [**cracks** in]{.mark} the international consensus on **[free
trade]{.mark}**; **Russia's** snubbing of **i**nternational **law** and
[invasion of **Ukraine**]{.mark}; the rise of [il- liberal regimes among
the **E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion's members; the [emergence of
**authoritarian rulers**]{.mark} and their **successful ef- forts to
fragment** and undermine liberal democratic **gover- nance** around the
globe; the [**rise** of the]{.mark} extreme political
**[Right]{.mark}**---all these combined to put the **postwar liberal
order** at risk. [Four years of an **antiliberal US president** who
scoffed at]{.mark} **liberal [institutions]{.mark}** [was]{.mark} simply
[the **latest blow**]{.mark} to liberal institutions]{.underline}.

There is, however, another way to tell the story. One al- ternative
narrative goes like this: [[the **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[l]{.mark}**iberal **[o]{.mark}**rder is a **delusion**]{.underline}.
[It never [has been **international**, **liberal**, or
**orderly**]{.mark}. During the Cold War, much of the world **did not
participate** in it.]{.underline} [The **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [used coercion to get its way in]{.mark}
**international [organizations]{.mark}**. [Governments in the Global
South]{.mark}, [struggling to]{.mark} quickly [establish **democracies**
so]{.mark} that [they could receive]{.mark} **US [aid]{.mark}**, held
**perfunctory** elections while refusing to establish an **independent
judiciary**, pro- tect **h**uman **r**ights, or permit **fundamental
freedoms**.]{.underline} [In the "one-party **democracies**" of
**Mexico**, **So**uth **Ko**rea, and **Tai- wan**, elections were
**held** and opposition **parties** appeared on the ballot, but for many
decades, [rulers]{.mark} [manipulated **elections** to maintain]{.mark}
their **[authoritarian power]{.mark}** with the blessing of the United
States.]{.underline} And while loudly advocating democratization across
the globe, [the United States [sup- ported corrupt]{.mark}
[regimes]{.mark} and [instigated coups]{.mark} and assassina- tion plots
against democratically elected leaders]{.underline}. Its [mil- itary
[unilaterally intervened abroad]{.mark}, breaking the rules of the
multilateral security institutions it had created]{.underline}. [Based
on the lie of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, it escalated its war with
Vietnam, which killed thousands of Americans and millions in Southeast
Asia.]{.underline} With the Cold War long over, the United States
launched an unlawful invasion of Iraq---also based on a lie---and
engaged in horrific acts of torture. [Lib-eral international
[institutions were]{.mark} only a thin **[ideological curtain]{.mark}**

**[Committed to a Losing Strategy?]{.underline}**

[Given]{.underline} these [negative **geopolitical
realities**]{.underline} forming, [[why have **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark} decided to maintain these **assertive** and coercive
strategic approaches, particularly in their **home
regions**?]{.underline} [Why [not **employ** a]{.mark} more
**[restrained]{.mark}** [approach]{.mark} looking [to take advantage of
**tensions**]{.mark} between regional **allies**, local powers, and the
US over **concerns** of the latter going **rogue** and **becoming** a
more coercive **hegemonic power** to build new **relations** and
**networks**?]{.underline} This is particularly relevant for China whose
shift towards more across-the-board coercion has been more dramatic
recently than compared to Russia which has a longer history of a highly
antagonistic approach towards the West for almost two decades.98 What
explains the paradoxical choice of maintaining these paradoxical
strategies?

[This [shift]{.mark} in **posture** and **orientation** is a mixture of
a **number** of factors, some of which are more or less **important** to
each power]{.underline}. Some of the most common rationales include the
following. First, [this [is a function of]{.mark} these **regimes'
assessment** of and [confidence in]{.mark} **long terms trends** of [US
hegemonic **decline**]{.mark} and **balances** of powers forming in
their favor]{.underline}, especially after the 2008 financial
recession.99 Chinese and Russian behavior, therefore, is
[[driven]{.mark} by a desire [to take **advantage**]{.mark} by
accelerating these trends]{.underline}. Second, [the **confrontational
posture** adopted by the Trump Administration, including the
**declaration** of **great power competition** against both powers as
the **central anchor governing** American grand strategy, contributed to
more **aggressive pursuits** and **posturing** by Beijing and
Moscow.]{.underline}100 Third, [[both powers **suffer**
from]{.underline}]{.mark} 'great state ~~autism'~~, the [[inability
to]{.mark} appreciate and [anticipate]{.mark} **different perspectives**
held by others, **especially** those who are/would be negatively by
their **actions**, [due to an excessive focus on **domestic
politics**]{.mark} which produces simplistic and inaccurate conceptions
of international politics]{.underline}.101 [[**China** and
**Russia**]{.mark}, therefore, enact and **[maintain]{.mark}**
[counter-productive **strategies**]{.mark} due to an inability to
foresee its negative consequences and adjust
**accordingly**.]{.underline}

These [explanations play an important role in understanding Chinese and
Russian revisionist behaviour]{.underline}, but do not adequately answer
this phenomenon in terms of timing. The Trump Administration's posture
and actions against both powers, specifically China, accelerated
tensions with them but did not mark the beginning of Russian and Chinese
turns towards assertiveness which had begun well before. Furthermore,
while great state ~~autism~~ can help explain the lack of garnering
major power allies for Russia and China over the years, it does not
account for the abandoning of their more benevolent regional approaches
-- Greater Europe for Russia and Smile Diplomacy for China -- towards
more coercive-assertive ones altering relations with other powers from
wary partnerships to alienation and enmity. Finally, [[while]{.mark}
**assessments** of [power trends are **important**]{.mark}, it is
plausible [China and Russia are **acting**]{.mark} not [out of]{.mark}
**confidence** but out of [concern]{.mark}, specifically [that future
conditions will be **less**]{.mark} **strategically [favorable]{.mark}**
than currently]{.underline}. [Furthermore, there appears to be growing
pressure on both to capitalize on a finite '**window of opportunity'**
to establish and lock-in favorable environmental settings while they
still can. Rather than riding long-term favorable power trends, Russia
and China, to **differing degrees** and intensities, [face **problematic
futures**]{.mark} which **motivate them** to act now before their
ability to do so wanes.]{.underline} [There are **three sources**
contributing to this pressure to act, which signal the **weakness**,
**short-term** and **long-term**, of these powers' abilities to
**alter** and **construct** favorable regional strategic
environments.]{.underline}

First, such [actions can be attributed to the **mobilization
strategies** of both regimes towards **rehabilitating** their states
back to **great power status** which is respected in the
world]{.underline}. Both the Putin and Xi regimes employ strategic
narratives of restoring their states to their proper status after
suffering calamitous geopolitical declines that the West produced,
contributed to, and/or took advantage of. For Putin, this is the
collapse of the Soviet Union and for Xi this is China's Century of
Humiliation. Such projects are becoming more central in the legitimation
of these regimes, which are increasingly authoritarian and personalist
in nature.102 For China, the self-imposed timelines, particularly around
2049 marking 100 years of Chinese Communist Party Rule, of achieving
this status places pressure to 'produce results' specifically in
relation to "core interests" such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.103
Similarly, the Putin regime sees Russia as incomplete, driving
imperialistic desires to physically control parts of the former Soviet
Union as a necessary condition to regain its place as a great power.
These actions, as well, are in part fueled by and furthering,
nationalist sentiments which are an important catalyst in mobilizing
society for these great power projects. Looking strong in international
affairs is increasingly important to portray themselves as great powers
which is a worthy pursuit, even if these efforts take away, or come at
the expense, of other domestic priorities and reforms.

Second, [[despite]{.mark} the **portrayal** of **[confidence]{.mark}**,
[both powers are]{.mark} largely [acting on the
**defensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China has not **altered** the
strategic realities in the "three-island chains" confronting its
**coastlines**]{.underline}, remaining populated by allied powers
allowing the US to station and project power in these spaces and thus
denying China's ability to deploy power unencumbered.105 [While it has
altered the **facts** on the **ground** in the South China Sea in terms
of **deploying** and stationing military forces on **reclaimed islets**,
China has increasingly]{.underline} strained relations with all other
claimants and there is a growing rate of extra-regional powers, besides
the US, increasingly operating there.106 Consensual [**unification**
with Taiwan is unrealistic, leaving only military **coercion** or
**invasion** as the only options -- which are highly dangerous given
**continued US commitment** to peace across the Taiwan Straits and its
official policy of **strategic ambiguity** to say nothing of the
difficulties of conducting a large scale **amphibious
operation**]{.underline}. Furthermore, Japan has become increasingly
vocal in working with the US in developing contingencies to assist
Taiwan in the event of a war. Repressive actions in Xinjiang and Hong
Kong, as well, have demonstrated the continued fixation on domestic
control and have led to a growing coalition of international actors
sanctioning and speaking out against these actions. As for Russia, much
of their diplomatic and military activity has been directed towards
propping up allies, such as Syria and Belarus, or preventing others from
gravitating towards the West such as their failed attempts in Ukraine.
Moscow, also, faces encroachments into its near abroad by Turkey in the
Caucuses and China in Central Asia challenging its regional leadership
role and position. Overall, Russia is acting on its back heel in the
sense of trying to retain the status-quo amidst a hostile environment of
intrusive outside powers, gravitational pressures towards the EU and
NATO into its near-abroad, and persistent democracy revolutions
threatening to remove many of its autocratic allies.

As well, despite periods of heightened concern about American
unilateralism and assertiveness during the GW Bush and Trump
Administrations, allies and close partners remain committed to American
hegemonic networks and their leading role in them in providing security
and economic goods. This has led to increasing frustration for Russia
and China in trying to cleave them apart, and take advantage of any such
alienation between them, to create space for new ways of regional
ordering. It is unclear under what conditions American allies and
partners would seriously consider re-orient geopolitically away from the
US other than complete abandonment by Washington.

Finally, and most importantly, [[both]{.mark} China and Russia [face
**problematic domestic futures** which]{.mark} will most likely
**[constrain]{.mark}** their ability to develop [material
capabilities]{.mark} that can be **deployed** to further their
**international interests**]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark} faces a very
**bleak future**, [experiencing **anemic economic growth**]{.mark}, a
[declining population]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} a lessening of
**quality-of-life factors** such as life expectancy.]{.underline}109
[With]{.underline} these latent [[power **bases** under strain]{.mark} -
shrinking workforce, increasing demands to care for a growing elderly
population, and less wealth to tax alongside **large-scale kleptocracy**
of elites - Russia will [**struggle** to]{.mark} continue to
[maintain]{.mark} and increase its military [power]{.mark}, and will
most likely have to spend more efforts and energy **keeping** the
Russian state integral than expanding beyond its borders either in
**direct control** or **influence**]{.underline}.110 The current
economic and financial [**[decoupling]{.mark}** with the West due to
**sanctions** imposed on them for their war against Ukraine, and the
**material losses** suffered by its military, [will
**accelerate**]{.mark} the **[erosion]{.mark}** of these power
bases.]{.underline} [[China]{.mark} is]{.underline} not in as
[dire]{.underline} an immediate situation as Russia, but [in the long
term [faces **bleak power development**]{.mark} prospects as
well]{.underline}. [Its **population** is rapidly **aging**, creating
similar demographic strains caused by a shrinking workforce and growing
demands to take care of an increasingly elderly
population]{.underline}.111 Economic [growth is slowing, and much of
that is based on government spending]{.underline}.112 China, as well,
faces massive environmental damage which will only be exacerbated by
climate change.

Both these powers are not houses of cards that will collapse in the
future. They are and will remain great powers important to regional, and
in some ways global, politics. [[The amount of **power**]{.mark},
however, [they can **devote** to international issues]{.mark} - either
in the **form** of military forces, investments, trade, and aid, or
soft/cultural power - [will **decrease**]{.mark} in the **decades**
ahead as more of their **power** will be needed [to service **domestic
issues**]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} maintaining their **centralized**,
[authoritarian governance]{.mark} systems]{.underline}. Other states,
such as Japan and Germany, are confronting similar demographic
challenges, but unlike China and Russia are relatively well-developed,
wealthy countries that can more sustainably allocate more of their
wealth to addressing and preparing for these changes.114 China and
Russia will face a more stark trade-off given their lower wealth
positions causing concerns these countries will get old before they get
rich, creating additional societal stresses given the growing
incongruence between economic/wealth desires and realities. [[As a
result]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} may **[become]{.mark}** increasingly
frustrated "**[faltering powers]{.mark}**" who are [not **able**
to]{.mark} **achieve** their strategic goals in **[shap]{.mark}**ing
**regional** and **global [environments]{.mark}** as a growing amount of
their **power** and **focus** must be managing these sizable and seismic
demographic-wealth issues.]{.underline}

### Authoritarian AI defense

#### No [exportation]{.underline} of Chinese [authoritarianism]{.underline}. 

**Kroenig 20** -- Matthew, Associate Professor in the Department of
Government and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown. "The Return of Great Power Rivalry: Democracy Versus
Autocracy from the Ancient World to the US and China", Oxford University
Press, pg. 195, xx-xx-2020

At the same time, we should understand that **[a China led by the [CCP
is unlikely to become]{.mark} the [world\'s leading state. Its
Marxist-Leninist model is not well suited to]{.mark} building a
world-beating, innovative economy, to [win- ning friends and
allies]{.mark} around the world, [or]{.mark} to [constructing a lethal
military forc]{.mark}e with global power-projection capabilities.
[China\'s autocratic system]{.mark}]{.underline}** has **[[undermined
its competitiveness]{.mark} before, including [under]{.mark} the [Qing
dynasty and Mao]{.mark}\'s CCP.]{.underline}** China did better when it
followed Deng\'s liberalizing eco- nomic guidance, but it is reverting
to its old form of dysfunctional authori- tarianism under President Xi.

Provocatively, the analysis in this chapter suggests that Taiwan\'s
island democracy may actually have an even brighter future than a
mainland China controlled by the CCP. This might seem preposterous at
first blush given the relative sizes of these countries today, but
**[let us review the [historical record.]{.mark} Few would have
predicted that the [Venetian Republic would sack]{.mark} the capital of
its former autocratic imperial master, the [Byzantine Empire. No one
expected]{.mark} the [Dutch Republic to defeat its authoritarian
overlords in Madrid.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And the United States was an
underdog to become the most pow- erful country in the history of the
world when it was a mere colony of the British Empire. **[[Small
democratic upstarts have a history of overawing their]{.mark} former
[imperial masters]{.mark} and becoming global powers]{.underline}** in
their own right. Perhaps the same future awaits Taipei and Beijing.

In the end, **[there are only three likely futures for the
CCP]{.underline}** that will be explored in greater detail in this
book\'s conclusion: **[reform, stagnate, or col- lapse.]{.underline}**
But **[[a world run by the CCP is not in the
cards.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Rather, the country best positioned to be
a true global leader for the next several decades is the same country
that has led the way for the past seventy- five years. That country is
the subject of our next chapter.

#### Digital authoritarianism is [false]{.underline}.

**Bernot 21** -- Ausma, PhD Candidate Griffith University. "China is
accused of exporting authoritarian technology. But the west has done so,
too, more covertly", The Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/china-is-accused-of-exporting-authoritarian-technology-but-the-west-has-done-so-too-more-covertly-168190>,
10-25-2021

[[China's 5G]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
now [been banned in many countries]{.underline}, [including Australia,
New Zealand, the US and many in the European Union]{.underline}. In
2019, a [NATO]{.underline} Cyber Defence Centre [report
[identified]{.mark} Huawei's 5G technology [as a **security
risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since September, [telecommunications providers in the US have been able
to apply for compensation]{.underline} through a US\$1.9 billion program
[designed to "rip and replace" **Huawei** and **ZTE** equipment, due to
perceived risks to national security.]{.underline}

But [[fears over]{.mark} China's attempts to export its digital and
surveillance technologies go far beyond just Huawei and 5G. China has
been accused of [exporting]{.mark} "**[digital
authoritarianism]{.mark}**" and spreading "**techno-authoritarianism
globally**". It's been **declared** a danger to the **rest of the
world**]{.underline}.

In [my research](https://www.crimejusticejournal.com/article/view/1908),
I argue the story of [**digital authoritarianism** [is **not**]{.mark}
that **[straightforward]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Technologies that help]{.mark} **authoritarian [leaders]{.mark}**
[collect **information** and control]{.mark} their [**populations** have
been **exported with few restrictions**]{.mark} **for
decades.**]{.underline} Although [[China does **export**]{.mark}
**ready-made [surveillance]{.mark}** systems to governments deemed as
oppressive, [countries in **Europe** and **North America** have also
done so]{.mark}, albeit more **covertly**.]{.underline}

**[China supports surveillance exports]{.underline}**, regardless of the
destination

[China falls in]{.underline} the direct [line]{.underline} of fire [for
criticism on this front]{.underline}.

First, [the country follows an authoritarian system]{.underline}. In a
[compilation of
speeches](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/15/c_137112987.htm)
by President Xi Jinping from 2012-18, he critiqued western political
systems and called for greater "[South-South
collaboration](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202107/09/WS60e6957ca310efa1bd66094e.html)"
between China and countries in the developing world.

These views have since been incorporated as part of a new national
ideology and China's influential Belt and Road Initiative.

Second, [both Chinese
[companies](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1146179.shtml) and the
Chinese
[government](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/15/c_137112987.htm)
have firmly maintained that countries are **free to decide** what they
**want to do** with the technologies they **purchase** from
China]{.underline}. They are neutral actors selling neutral technologies
to other countries.

China is the largest exporter of telecommunications equipment,
computers, and telephones in the world, with the [US as its biggest
destination](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/chn?viztypeSelector=trendsType1).
It has also exported digital infrastructure to more than [60 mostly
developing
countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/china-is-exporting-its-digital-authoritarianism/2020/08/05/f14df896-d047-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html)
through its Belt and Road Initiative.

Some of the most problematic exports of Chinese surveillance
technologies include:

[CloudWalk's](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-more-chinas-tech-giants)
facial recognition database in Zimbabwe, which opponents
[say](https://www.thestandard.co.zw/2020/03/01/creating-surveillance-state-ed-govt-zooms-critics-chinese-help/)
may be used to monitor government critics

technicians from Huawei
[engaging](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-technicians-helped-african-governments-spy-on-political-opponents-11565793017)
in political espionage in Uganda and Zambia

the development of a controversial new "fatherland card" to monitor
civilian activities in Venezuela

the sale of smart [surveillance
technologies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/ecuador-surveillance-cameras-police-government.html)
to the previous authoritarian government of Ecuador.

The 'tech neutrality' cloak for western companies

However, Chinese companies are not the only actors in the global trade
arena that benefit from the argument of "technological neutrality".

Companies from Europe and North America jumped at the first chance they
got to sell surveillance systems to China in the early 2000s. Many of
those technologies strengthened China's online censorship system.

In a watershed report video in 2001, an independent researcher, [Greg
Walton](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.696199/publication.html),
showed that international companies started marketing their products to
Chinese public security agencies as early as 2000 during a large
security expo in Beijing. The same
[expo](http://www.chinaexhibition.com/Official_Site/11-9828-CPSE_2019_-_The_17th_China_Public_Security_Expo.html)
continued to attract international companies until the COVID-19 travel
disruptions in 2020.

In [2006](https://www.jamestgriffiths.com/), Cisco was investigated by a
US House subcommittee for selling surveillance technologies to China.
The company defended itself by stressing its right to international
trade and technological neutrality.

A couple of years later, Cisco again defended its right to sell to China
in a meeting with the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights.
A representative of the company
[argued](https://www.forbes.com/2007/11/01/cisco-china-investments-markets-equity-cx_ml_1101markets17.html?sh=43e3cf8d4e74):

One thing tech companies cannot do, in my opinion, is involve themselves
in politics of a country.

Earlier this year, investigative journalist Mara Hvistendahl also
[reported](https://theintercept.com/2021/05/25/oracle-social-media-surveillance-protests-endeca/)
that Oracle (the same company that won the bid to co-host TikTok's data
in the US) had pitched its predictive policing analytics to public
security agencies in China.

And in 2019, the UK [was
found](https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/resource/exporting-repression-how-britain-supplying-surveillance-technology-human-rights-abusing/)
to have exported telecommunications interception equipment to multiple
countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

[A political science researcher at the University of Cape Town, [Mandira
Bagwandeen](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2021/09/09/dont-blame-china-for-rise-of-digital-authoritarianism-africa-surveillance-capitalism/),
argues [it's easy to]{.mark} [point fingers]{.mark} to China,
**diverting attention** from other countries.]{.underline}

[Let's face it, [if the **US was**]{.mark} **really [serious]{.mark}**
[about restricting]{.mark} the **spread** of so-called '**[authoritarian
technolog]{.mark}y**', then [it should]{.mark} also [impose
**comprehensive measures**]{.mark} and **restrictions** [on]{.mark} both
[**democratic** and **autocratic** producers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We need better monitoring of the surveillance tech trade

[The fact is surveillance technologies with the capability to gather and
analyse information about people are **inherently
political**]{.underline}.

that [digital surveillance resolves the "information problem" in
authoritarian countries by allowing **dictators** to more easily
**identify those with anti-regime beliefs**.]{.underline}

But [[regulating]{.mark} new **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [is

#### China's [development]{.underline} of AI is [defensive]{.underline}.

**Ding 18** -- Jeffery, Phil Researcher at Future of Humanity Institute

Institute & Oxford University,

[**[Media reports]{.underline}** **[of an AI arms
race]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[between the U.S. and China [have
proliferated]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2017,153 **[and leading thinkers
have identified AI as a technology that could provide a decisive
strategic advantage]{.underline}** in the international security
realm.154 **[[In contrast, much of]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} academic
[literature discussing military]{.mark} possibilities for [AI
tech]{.mark}nology [has been largely abstract]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[and speculative]{.mark}, and a [majority]{.mark} of it
[references]{.mark} or focuses [on]{.mark} the [U.S.
D]{.mark}]{.underline}**efense **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**dvanced
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**esearch **[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**rojects
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency's **[activities]{.underline}**.155
**[Chinese military institutions]{.underline}**, such as the NUDT,
**[have increased their research efforts on intelligent
robotics]{.underline}**.156 In the short-term, the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) will likely continue to adopt a range of unmanned vehicles
into all four services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force).157
Combined with breakthroughs in UAV swarming and intelligentized
missiles, these developments could challenge the U.S. military presence
in the Pacific theater.

In the long-term, China's AI development could revolutionize its conduct
of military affairs. Although material evidence for Chinese
militarization of AI is limited, some rhetorical evidence does show that
China sees AI as a revolutionary military technology. In a statement on
the central government's work report by Lieutenant General Liu Guozhi,
director of the Central Military Commission's Science and Technology
Commission, he states, in reference to military applications of AI, that
the world is "on the eve of a new scientific and technological
revolution," and "whoever doesn't disrupt will be disrupted!"158
Combined with AI's dual-use nature, China's high degree of
civil-military fusion has raised concerns about the military
applications of AI. Li Deyi, as a quintessential example, is both the
director of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence and a
major general in the PLA.159 **[To emphasize, [many]{.mark} of these
[projections]{.mark} [are]{.mark} largely
[speculative]{.mark}]{.underline}** as the most sensitive military AI
applications are not publicly disclosed. **[[There is not a
coherent]{.mark} [consensus]{.mark} of ideas [on AI in warfare]{.mark}
within the PLA]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[[the influence of the PLA is
not overwhelming]{.mark}, as other bureaucratic entities often have
diverging views and the central party apparatus possesses final
decision-making powers]{.underline}**.

The degree to which China's militarization will constitute a revolution
in military affairs is an important question. Drawing from
Chinese-language, open-source articles by military scholars, a recent
report by Elsa Kania, at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS),
argues that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) views AI as a
"trump card" technology that could revolutionize the conduct of future
warfare.160 As the CNAS report acknowledges, the thinking of the PLA and
the central government on the direction of military AI is not
solidified. **[[Evidence from]{.mark} the PLA's investment in UAV
swarming and intelligentized [missiles shows that]{.mark} [the most
immediate applicationsof]{.mark} military [AI could align with]{.mark}
more [limited, defensive goals]{.mark}, including asymmetric countering
of U.S. military superiority in the Western Pacific and protecting
China's nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**.161

### A2 S-Risks

#### S-risks are [super low]{.underline} probability.

**Hilton 22** \[Benjamin Hilton (Research Analyst, 80,000 Hours; former
civil policy adviser across the UK government in the Cabinet Office,
Treasury, and Department for International Trade; M.A. in economics;
M.S. in theoretical physics), September 2022, "'S-risks'," 80,000 Hours,
https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/s-risks/, njn\]

In large part this depends on how we define the term (we've seen various
possible definitions). We think it's very likely that there will be at
least some suffering in the future, and potentially on very large scales
--- potentially vastly more suffering than has existed on Earth so far,
especially if there are many, many more individuals in the future and
they live a variety of lives. But often [when people talk about
**[s-risks]{.mark}**, they [are]{.mark} talking about]{.underline} the
risk of [outcomes **[so bad]{.mark}** that [they are **worse**
than]{.mark} the **[extinction]{.mark}** of humanity]{.underline}. Our
guess is that [[the **likelihood**]{.mark} of such risks [is very low,
**much lower** than]{.mark} risks of human
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[which is]{.underline}]{.mark}
part of [[why we **focus**]{.mark} more [on the
**latter**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### That means you should weight [extinction]{.underline} more [heavily]{.underline}.

**Daniel 17** \[Max Daniel (Senior Program Associate, Open
Philanthropy), 6-20-2017, "S-risks: Why they are the worst existential
risks, and how to prevent them (EAG Boston 2017)," Center on Long-Term
Risk, https://longtermrisk.org/s-risks-talk-eag-boston-2017/, njn\]

This is a very complex question. To understand just how complex it is, I
first want to introduce [[a **flawed argument** for]{.mark} focusing on
[reducing **s-risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (I'm not claiming that anyone
has advanced such an argument about either s-risks or x-risks.) This
flawed argument [[goes as follows]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Premise 1:]{.underline} The best thing to do is to [[prevent the
**worst risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Premise 2: [S-risks are]{.mark} the **[worst]{.mark}**]{.underline}
risks

[**[Conclusion]{.mark}**: The best thing to do is to **[prevent
s-risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}

I said that [this argument **isn't sound**]{.underline}. Why is that?

Before delving into this, let's get one potential source of ambiguity
out of the way. On one reading, premise 1 could be a value judgment. In
this sense, it could mean that, whatever you expect to happen in the
future, you think there is a specific reason to prioritize averting the
worst possible outcomes. There is a lot one could say about the pros and
cons as well as about the implications of such views, but this is not
the sense of premise 1 I'm going to talk about. In any case, I don't
think any purely value-based reading of premise 1 suffices to get this
argument off the ground. More generally, I believe that your values can
give you substantial or even decisive reasons to focus on s-risk, but
I'll leave it at that.

What I want to focus on instead is that, (nearly) [no matter your
values, **premise 1 is false**.]{.underline} Or at least it's false if,
by "the worst risks", we understand what we've talked about so far, that
is, badness [along the dimensions of **scope** and
**severity**]{.underline}.

When [trying to find the action with the **highest ethical impact**
[there are]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, [[**more relevant** criteria
than **scope** and **severity**]{.mark} of a risk.]{.underline} [[What's
**missing** are]{.mark} a risk's [probability]{.mark}; the
**[tractability]{.mark}** of preventing]{.underline} it; [[and]{.mark}
its **[neglectedness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. S-risks are by definition
the worst risks in terms of scope and severity, but not necessarily in
terms of probability, tractability, and neglectedness.

[[These]{.mark} additional criteria [are **clearly
relevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[if s-risks]{.mark}
turned out to [have **probability zero**, or]{.mark} if
[reducing]{.mark} them [was completely **intractable**, it wouldn't
make]{.mark} any [sense to **try**]{.mark}]{.underline} to reduce them.

massive production and export volumes of cheap U.S. LNG---carries
immediate and tangible risks with destabilizing global implications as
well as domestic consequences. China continues to benefit from the
resale of cheap U.S. LNG exports]{.underline}]{.mark}, investing profits
to expand its influence in global energy markets and across the
international community.6 [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} dynamic
[[intensifies China's strategic competition with the U.S. and thus
presents concerns for U.S. national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
growing LNG industry also presents problems within the United States, as
increasing LNG export volumes are associated with higher domestic LNG
prices. [[Additionally, LNG is a hazardous substance that can pose
immediate health and safety risks]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
environment and American communities through methane leakage and
pollution.

#### The entire reason the Department of Energy (DOE) temporarily [paused]{.underline} U.S. LNG exports because China was storing it for future military aggression

[\[U.S. Department of Energy = DOE\]]{.underline}

Why would the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates consider
restricting LNG sales to China? [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} accounted
for less than 4% of all [U.S. LNG exports in 2023, but it is [now the
largest designated destination by volume under all long-term U.S. LNG
contracts,]{.mark} and Chinese buyers account for almost 25% of the
volume of long-term contracts entered into by LNG export facilities
affected by the DOE's LNG export pause.]{.underline}\[1\] The [[rapid
growth of China's acquisition of U.S.-sourced LNG]{.underline}]{.mark}
under long-term contracts has [[produced worries about a possible
buildup of energy supplies ahead of military
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as concerns about cheaper
Chinese steel, aluminum, and EV cars potentially flooding the U.S.
market directly or indirectly through Mexico. Long-term LNG contracts
signed with U.S. project developers have generally been priced lower
than LNG from other sources, [partly because U.S. natural gas is
cheaper]{.underline} than gas elsewhere and partly because of robust
competition among U.S. project developers[. Denying China access to U.S.
LNG, the argument goes, might help keep its exports to the U.S. from
being so cheap.]{.underline}

In the case of an escalating security situation, [[Taiwan's
overdependence on seaborne LNG is a weakness that China may choose to
weaponize]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The country]{.underline}]{.mark} was
among the top ten LNG importers in 2023, and [[relies on LNG imports to
generate 40 percent of its electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}.86 [[A
Chinese blockade around Taiwan preventing LNG shipments would
significantly endanger the island's energy
security]{.underline}]{.mark}, exacerbated by the fact that Taiwan's
natural gas storage only covers 11 days.87 In the short term,
contracting with U.S. LNG producers may moderately bolster Taiwan's
energy security, as China might be reluctant to intercept LNG cargo out
of fear of provoking the U.S. into a military conflict. Taiwan received
just under 10 percent of its LNG from the U.S. in 2023;88 Increasing
these volumes could give the country added protection from a Chinese
blockade risk. [[In the long term, Taiwan should expand its LNG storage
capacity and pursue an energy diversification policy to reduce its
energy vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Asia trade declining

#### Asia's demand for LNG is in a downward trend -- they won't need our exports

Sam **Reynolds** Concerns about the U.S. LNG pause in Asia are overblown

https://ieefa.org/resources/concerns-about-us-lng-pause-asia-are-overblown

Third, [[the U.S.'s largest customers, Japan and South Korea, are set to
dramatically reduce their LNG demand.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[In 2023,
Japan's LNG demand fell 8% and has declined at an average rate of 3%
since 2014]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[IEEFA estimates that higher nuclear
and renewable power generation could cause Japan's LNG demand to fall by
27 million tons by 2030, nearly a third of its current imports. Many
Japanese gas and power utilities have publicly acknowledged that
they]{.underline}]{.mark} are likely to [[have excess
LNG]{.underline}]{.mark} due to declining domestic demand. JERA, for
example, has
[said](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/japans-jera-sees-more-lng-going-asia-domestic-demand-shrinks-2023-04-30/)
it expects to divert supplies to other countries. [[Many Asian utilities
have opened [trading
desks](https://www.ft.com/content/f6019746-e7df-40da-ad88-53eff8d531c4)
in Europe,]{.underline}]{.mark} hoping to trade more LNG rather than
supply home markets. [[South Korean LNG demand fell 4% in
2023]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The country's climate and energy targets
suggest LNG demand could fall 20% by 2036]{.underline}]{.mark}, as LNG
is displaced by increases in renewable energy. From 2021 to 2023,
operating losses at Korea's state-run power utility totaled over US\$35
billion due to high LNG and other fossil fuel prices, adding financial
impetus to reduce LNG dependence.

LNG pause does not threaten South Korea's energy security and transition
https://ieefa.org/resources/three-reasons-us-lng-pause-does-not-threaten-south-koreas-energy-security-and-transition

Despite less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, LNG\'s role in greenhouse
gas reduction is controversial due to its high methane emissions, as
methane has a more significant warming effect than CO2 over a relatively
short time frame. [[The South Korean government aims to decrease LNG\'s
share in the power mix from 26.82% in 2023 to 9.3% by
2036]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[South Korea's LNG imports have already
decreased by 4.9% in 2023 amid increased nuclear and renewable energy
generation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This trend is likely to continue with
the country's [strengthened decarbonization
targets](https://ieefa.org/resources/lessons-cop28-south-koreas-energy-transition-pledges-will-reduce-need-lng-investments).
[[The predicted annual reduction rate]{.underline}]{.mark} of LNG demand
in South Korea, at 3.6%, [[could offset the portion of U.S. LNG in total
LNG imports]{.underline}]{.mark}, currently at 11%, by the end of this
decade.

### Plan increases domestic LNG prices

#### High domestic natural gas production spikes price volatility

https://www.americansecurityproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ref-0298-Strategic-Implications-of-U.S.-LNG.pdf

As LNG exports reached record levels in 2023, U.S. natural gas
production continued to outpace consumption, helping facilitate a return
to low U.S. natural gas spot prices. The average Henry Hub price in 2023
was \$2.67 per Mcf, the lowest level since the 2020 COVID-related demand
slump.182 However, [[high domestic natural gas production failed to
protect Americans from the price volatility of the
global]{.underline}]{.mark} [[natural gas market]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For example, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a surge in
international LNG demand in 2022, Henry Hub spot prices reached their
highest level in more than a decade, averaging \$6.70 per Mcf.183
[[Global price spikes cost U.S. consumers an extra \$111
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} to purchase wholesale natural gas during
the sixteen months from September 2021 through December 2022, according
to a study by IEEFA.184 [[The U.S. electricity price continues to be
tied to the price of natural gas]{.underline}]{.mark}, which fueled 43.1
percent of electric power generation in 2023.185 [[Even small gas price
increases can drive electricity costs up as utilities powered by
gas-fired power plants increase their rates]{.underline}]{.mark}. States
like Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have
experienced significant electricity rate increases due to their heavy
reliance on natural gas for power generation.186 [[Given the high number
of future U.S. LNG export projects already approved, domestic gas
markets will continue to be exposed to price
volatility]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting from global market forces,
[[which risks putting American households and businesses under financial
stress from higher electricity prices]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Rising LNG exports increase domestic gas prices

[[Liquified natural gas prices are forecast to
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} heading into 2025 [[as demand is set to
outpace supply]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to an
[analysis](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/natgas.php) from the
federal Energy Information Administration. Average dry gas production
[wobbled](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-natgas-output-decline-demand-hits-record-high-2024-eia-says-2024-11-13/)
down from 2023 to 2024, with companies ramping down production to try
and counter record low prices over the past year, Reuters reported.
While companies are expected to
[increase](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-natural-gas-drillers-lift-2025-output-reversing-year-cuts-2024-11-21/)
production again in 2025, [[demand is expected to well outpace supply
and cause a spike in prices]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[The combination of
growing LNG exports, increased electrical generation
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and the prospect of winter weather
suggests a tighter supply-demand picture for natural gas in 2025 and
beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}," Thomas Jorden, CEO at Coterra Energy, said
in a statement. The EIA explains how [[rising demand for exports means
domestic gas]{.underline}]{.mark} [[prices are predicted to rise
33%]{.mark}]{.underline} from a four-year low in 2024 to a three-year
high in 2025, "[[mainly because of increased liquefied natural gas (LNG)
exports]{.underline}]{.mark}," Bank of America analysts said in a
statement, according to Reuters. Louisiana produces and uses vast
amounts of natural gas, and price increases could affect consumers who
live in the state as well as industry interests.

[[Another major cost]{.underline}]{.mark} for consumers [[is natural

residential and commercial buildings, produce electricity, and provide
process heat for industrial manufacturers. [[For most of the last 15
years, natural gas prices have been historically
low]{.underline}]{.mark} due to the shale revolution. [[But expanding
LNG exports increasingly will link US markets with global ones, where
prices are much higher. Simply put, exporting more LNG will put upward
pressure on domestic prices, raising costs for consumers across the
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### US-China War defense

#### China [won't]{.underline} risk [conflict]{.underline}.

Even if China is willing to fulfill its mission by launching a war with
the U.S., [can [China]{.mark}]{.underline} **[afford it]{.underline}**?
First, [the top Chinese leader [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not ready
for war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with U.S]{.underline}. [China
will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [be able to take a
risk]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** internal [coordination and
support]{.underline}. The voice of China's foreign policy comes from
different departments. [They are]{.underline} **[[not]{.mark} well
[coordinated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and lack]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a long-term vision. [China does
not have a]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
making [consistent and workable foreign policy]{.underline}, and the top
leader has not gained sufficient power to manage foreign relations.
[China is [facing a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mountain of domestic
problems]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[corruption]{.underline}** [in the military]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[Chinese government]{.underline} has [learned the lesson]{.underline}
that [a combination of internal violence and external conflict can
contribute to the]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the
regime]{.underline}. Now **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping
[is]{.underline} more [likely to [focus on]{.mark} China's]{.underline}
**[domestic]{.underline}** [issues especially [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[pandemic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [consequences
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[economic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[financial]{.underline}** [areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xi's [top
priority]{.underline} before the 20th Congress of the CCP [is
to]{.underline} carefully [manage the]{.underline} **[power
balance]{.underline}** [among factions in the party]{.underline},
attempting to ensure his third term of presidency. After the 20th
Congress, Xi will take some time to reorganize the system and put new
policies in place. It is [not wise for the CCP to take]{.underline}
**[military risks]{.underline}** [in dealing with territorial disputes
with various countries at the same time as it tries to
maintain]{.underline} **[domestic]{.underline}** [social
stability]{.underline}. China cannot afford to fight against multiple
countries at the same time because [the [U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[military treaties]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with several allies in the
region]{.underline}. [[Taking military action]{.mark}s
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [**[destroy]{.underline}** [Xi's
China Dream]{.underline}]{.mark}, his lifelong
[[presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}, his [domestic [agenda
and]{.mark}]{.underline} China's [global [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}
eventually. Considering all these challenges, [Chinese
leaders]{.underline} may **[continue]{.underline}** their [efforts
to]{.underline} **[rebalance]{.underline}** [the relationship between
China and the U.S. while boosting]{.underline} the [economic
growth]{.underline} and preparing the unification with Taiwan after the
20th National Congress of the CCP in 2022.

Second, [China]{.underline} has [understood]{.underline} that **[any
conflict]{.underline}** between China and the U.S. [would be
a]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [disaster]{.underline},
especially between the two nuclear powers.78 A war between the two
giants is unthinkable.79 It could be a Third World War if the U.S. had a
war with China.80 China now has 260 nuclear weapons in its stockpile,
while the U.S. has 4670 or more. [[China]{.mark} promised that it would
[implement a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**o
**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se" nuclear
[policy]{.underline}, implying that the country possesses nuclear
weapons only to deter other states from a nuclear attack and expresses
the purely self-defensive nature of China's nuclear strategy. More
fundamentally, [it has demonstrated a]{.underline} viable [path
toward]{.underline} international **[nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}**.81 Many China experts "appear not to be
worried by China's rapidly growing nuclear capabilities, because
[Beijing's official policy promises]{.underline} that [China will not be
the]{.underline} **[first]{.underline}** [to employ nuclear weapons in a
conflict]{.underline}. Beijing promises that its nuclear forces are for
deterrence and retaliation only, not for aggression."82 However, China
continues to develop its nuclear weapons. China is likely to double the
size of its nuclear stockpile in a few years.83 U.S. military leaders
are not as naïve as academics about China's "no first use" pledge.
Charles Richard, chief of U.S. Strategic Command, testified to the
Senate Armed Services Committee that he could "drive a truck through
China's 'no first use' policy, because China's unprecedented rapid
expansion of its nuclear and missile capabilities is not consistent with
a belief in 'minimum deterrence' and 'no first use.'"84 In January 2022,
five global nuclear powers who are the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, the U.S., the UK, Russia, China, and France, signed a
joint statement and agreed to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading and
to ensure a nuclear war would not happen. The agreement itself is a
positive sign, indicating that nuclear deterrence is working and there
will be no massive war between China and the U.S.85 Practically, it is
hard to trust a dictator's words. In March 2022, Putin already put
nuclear deterrent forces on high alert and attacked Europe's largest
nuclear plant just a month after Russia signed the joint statement.

Third, [the Chinese [economy and military]{.mark} are]{.underline}
**[[not strong enough]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to support
war]{.underline} with the U.S. China will unlikely enter to war if it
cannot win because [the CCP]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}**
[afford a loss]{.underline}. China will wage war when it sees itself
winning at least cost. China is the fastest-growing economy in the world
but [there are many]{.underline} more [statistics that]{.underline} come
to the front of arguments, which [question the]{.underline} size of the
[Chinese]{.underline} economy and its actual **[economic]{.underline}**
[situation]{.underline}. The economic and social [consequences
of]{.underline} **[zero-case]{.underline}** [tolerance policy
are]{.underline} clearly [serious and far-reaching]{.underline}. China
is still a developing country. [China does]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rank [among the 100 richest]{.mark}
nations]{.underline} based on **[[per capita]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Among 1.4 billion people, about 50% of Chinese people live in rural
areas, 400 million people live on less than \$2 a day, and 200 million
people live on less than a dollar per day. Even if China will continue
its economic growth for years, [it may]{.underline}
**[never]{.underline}** [surpass the U.S. because it faces]{.underline}
**[many obstacles]{.underline}**.86 [[U.S. military spending
grows]{.mark} as]{.underline} **[policy shifts]{.underline}**
[[to]{.mark} "prioritize China" with]{.underline} **[\$[813]{.mark}.3
[billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2022 [while [China's]{.mark} military
spending has reached]{.underline} **[\$[230]{.mark}
billion]{.underline}** in 2022. China's military budget is only about
28% of the U.S. The PLA has approximately 975,000 active-duty personnel,
the largest navy in the world with an overall battle force of
approximately 355 ships and submarines, the largest aviation force in
the region and the third largest in the world, with over 2800 total
aircraft of which approximately 2250 are combat aircraft. China develops
new intercontinental ballistic missiles, continues to increase its
inventory of road-mobile DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles
(IRBM), and has its first operational hypersonic weapons system, the
DF-17 hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), and medium-range ballistic missile
(MRBM). China is determined to build a "world-class" military by the end
of 2049.87 However, [the]{.underline} [**[comprehensive]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the PLA]{.underline} still **[[lags far
behind]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline}** [If China learned a lesson
from]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**'s failures in the invasion of
Ukraine, [it should never take on the U.S. head even when fully
modernized]{.underline}. Although China's navy, ground troop, and air
forces have developed rapidly in the past two decades,
[[considering]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[quality]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[overall strength]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the
military, [as well as]{.mark} the strength of military
[alliances]{.mark}, China would]{.underline} **[lose]{.underline}** [the
war if it launched a war with the U.S.]{.underline} Any war with the
U.S. will be near its shores where [the U.S. will have a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** [winning advantage]{.underline}.88

Fourth, [China will feel]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** [to
justify a war]{.underline} with U.S. Military strength is the basis for
consideration if China goes to war. [If China's military power is at
an]{.underline} absolute **[advantage]{.underline}**, [it]{.underline}
still [lacks the]{.underline} **[pre-conditions]{.underline}** [for war
with the U.S.]{.underline} If China's military power evenly matches with
the U.S., it should be cautious about starting a war. China has not
arrived at the stage to initiate a war. Military power is not simply
about military budget and weapons. **[Real]{.underline}** war
**[experience]{.underline}** [must be taken into
consideration]{.underline}. [China does not have real]{.underline}
military [experience to win a]{.underline} **[modern]{.underline}**
[war]{.underline} with the U.S. After the establishment of the PRC,
China went to conventional war several times, including the Korean War,
the war with India (1967), and the Vietnam War (1979). It cannot rule
out that China will follow the same pattern to go to war in the future.
However, the Iraq war and the 2022 War between Russia and Ukraine
indicate that contemporary war is completely different from traditional
war. Chinese military power is untested in the contemporary military
war. Moreover, the CCP has not faced an immediate military threat from
the U.S. Military experts' [research projects on when and why
Beijing]{.underline} **[uses force]{.underline}** have [reached
a]{.underline} **[similar]{.underline}** [conclusion]{.underline}:
[[China attacks not when]{.mark} it feels]{.underline}
**[[confident]{.underline}]{.mark}** about the future, [[but when
it]{.underline} **[worries]{.underline}**]{.mark} [its [enemies are
closing in]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thomas Christensen, the director of the
China and the World Program at Columbia University, points out that the
Chinese Communist Party wages war when it perceives an opening window of
vulnerability regarding its territory and immediate periphery, or a
closing window of opportunity to consolidate control over disputed
areas. This [pattern holds]{.underline} **[regardless]{.underline}** [of
the strength of China's opponent]{.underline}.89 The
**[Biden]{.underline}** Administration has [made it clear]{.underline}
that [the U.S. does not intend to change the Chinese regime]{.underline}
while competing with China on various fronts. When China does not face a
direct military threat from the U.S., [the CCP does not
have]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}** [to take risk of going to
war]{.underline}.

Fifth, [it could be [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[suicide]{.underline}**
[mission]{.underline}]{.mark} [if China decided [to go to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} with the U.S. before improving its military
quality. [The]{.underline} **[quality of]{.underline}** military
**[commanders]{.underline}** [is the key]{.underline} to win or defeat
in wars. The quality of fighters and the wisdom of commanders are
inseparable. Wise commanders should be capable of planning and deploying
a variety of plans before the war starts. Even if Chinese military power
cannot match the U.S. as long as they can carry out military strikes at
a right time and at a favorable location, China can still win. Overall,
[Chinese military commanders]{.underline} **[do not]{.underline}**
[possess]{.underline} such a [quality]{.underline}. Soldier qualities
include military skills and knowledge, actual combat and decision-making
capabilities, physical endurance, and psychological qualities. Since the
war between China and Vietnam in 1979, China has been no war with other
countries for more than 40 years. China's active military personnel grew
up in peacetime and enlisted in a peaceful environment. During the forty
years of reform and opening-up period, the military is inevitably
influenced by the peaceful lifestyle. [Although China]{.underline} has
**[dramatically]{.underline}** [increased military expenditures and
speeded up]{.underline} its [military modernization, the PLA obviously
[lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[sufficient actual]{.underline}**]{.mark}
combat **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [involving the integration
of sea, land, and air battles]{.underline}. In recent years, China has
tried to improve its military combat effectiveness, but [the Chinese
military has a]{.underline} **[long way to catch up]{.underline}**
[[with]{.mark} the [U.S.' experience]{.mark} of real war]{.underline}.
The one-child policy seriously affects the quality of the military.
China's active military personnel have grown up in a relatively superior
environment, and men will be particularly favored regardless of whether
they come from the city or the countryside, so they lack self-care
ability, communication skills, patience, and endurance. Their personal
character is very fragile and is likely to collapse on the battlefield.

Sixth, the morale of the Chinese army is low. The [morale of the army is
the]{.underline} **[spiritual pillar]{.underline}** [in the
war]{.underline}; morale makes the war invincible under certain
conditions; and the army would be a mess without morale. Morale is not
an empty political slogan, but it is courage and determination when they
face the enemy. Morale is not injected by propaganda but is nurtured by
faith and the example of officers and actual interests. Under the
one-party system and the rigid censorship system, [Chinese
soldiers]{.underline} like all Chinese citizens [have been]{.underline}
**[brainwashed]{.underline}** [by communist ideas]{.underline}. The
[injected]{.underline} so-called **[communist belief]{.underline}**
[without faith could be]{.underline} **[suddenly]{.underline}**
[collapsed during a real war in a real world]{.underline}. In addition,
China's [corruption is]{.underline} **[systematic]{.underline}**, [and
the military is]{.underline} **[no exception]{.underline}** [from the
top to the bottom]{.underline} of the military system. By January 2015,
sixteen senior military officers were under investigation for
accusations of corruption. These officers are at the corps level or
above. They include one general, four lieutenant generals, nine major
generals, and one senior colonel. After Xu Caihou, former vice-chairman
of the Central Military Commission, was caught in 2014, the CPC began to
investigate Guo Boxiong in 2015, the second former top military officer
on suspicion of corruption. Fang Fenghui, China's military chief of
staff was jailed for life for corruption in 2019. Military corruption
deadly threatens China's security and degrades China's military
capability in protecting its nation. One of the causes of the
Nationalist government's defeat was corruption, which destroyed the
morale of the military. [Chinese [soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[witnessed]{.underline} **[systematic corruption]{.underline}** in the
post-Mao era, [so they [will not]{.mark} be willing to]{.underline}
[**[sacrifice]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [corrupted
[Chinese]{.mark} military [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. To regain
morale, China must reform its political system, clean up corrupted
military officials, change the compulsory military service system, and
improve Chinese soldiers' salaries and benefits.

Seventh, [[peaceful resolution to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[resolve
territorial [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[remains the first
choice]{.mark} for]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}**
[sides]{.underline}. The goal of diplomacy is to persuade your enemy to
surrender without a fight. A weak country does not have diplomacy.
National comprehensive power determines diplomatic confidence; and
military power and popular support provide the precondition for winning
war. If a country's comprehensive power is insufficient, it can only
deal with territory disputer through unequal diplomacy. If the military
is powerful and the people's aspirations are strong, military force
deterrence should cooperate with diplomatic means. If a country is not
ready, it must not advocate war. Otherwise, the government would lose
its credibility at home and abroad. [[China and]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[have]{.underline}
**[sufficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} [time to take]{.underline}
**[[diplomatic measures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to fulfill their
mission]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** [any cost]{.underline}.
In addition, a [possible war over the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[and]{.underline} the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** Strait [is not a
conventional land war but sea-air warfare]{.underline}. [If war
occurs]{.underline} over the region, [the U.S.]{.underline}
**[superiority]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[ASB]{.underline}**
[is still absolute and China's military attempts would]{.underline}
**[fail]{.underline}** although China has massive ground troops and the
largest size of navy force in the world.

Eighth, **[Russia]{.underline}** could be a negative equity for China on
the global stage and [will]{.underline} **[not help China]{.underline}**
[win war with the U.S. after]{.underline} Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}. [[China has]{.underline}]{.mark} very **[[few
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [whereas American allies in the Pacific
include]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}**,
**[Australia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea. While China is losing its neighboring friends,
[the U.S. has been]{.underline} **[strengthening]{.underline}** [its
alliance with China's neighboring countries]{.underline}, including
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Afghanistan, and India. [Other
countries, such as]{.underline} **[Vietnam]{.underline}**,
**[Malaysia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Myanmar]{.underline}**
[are drawing closer]{.underline} to the U.S. The Chinese government
views the regional tension as the outcome of Washington's "returning to
Asia" policy. Under this circumstance, [China needs]{.underline}
**[help]{.underline}** from Russia [to avoid escalating
confrontations]{.underline} with multiple neighboring countries. In a
global context, Russia has played a considerable role in China--U.S.
relations since the Cold War. The recent development of China--Russia
relations has once again raised American concerns about the implications
of Beijing--Moscow relations. Many experts believe that China's motive
for deepening its relations with Russia is anti-America. According to
the joint statement between Russia and China released before the 2022
Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the two countries' relationship has no
limits and there are no forbidden areas. Now there are two parallel
geopolitical conflicts---the Ukraine--Russia war and China--U.S. tension
over the Taiwan Strait. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed that the China--Russia partnership is solid
as stone and the Sino-Russian partnership continues, no matter how
serious the international situation is. China's current stance seems
that China has fully thrown itself into a de facto alliance with Russia.

China and Russia are almost impossible to form a solid partnership.
Superficially, the top leaders of the two countries can get along but
their personal relationship cannot be automatically translated into
foreign policy and military alliances. The restoration of the friendship
between Beijing and Moscow is mainly driven by their domestic pressures
and security concerns. A stable relationship between the two countries
will relieve the financial burdens in support of the hostility along the
sizeable border. Beijing and Moscow also have common interests to work
together. Beijing demands more oil and natural gas from Russia and needs
more advanced military weapons supplies, including submarines, warships,
and aircraft. Russia wants more investments from China to speed up the
development of the Russian economy. Arguably, China does not really need
military technologies from Russia. For example, the Chinese J-20 fighter
is more advanced than Su-35, equivalent to Russia's T50 and the U.S.
F-22. The purpose of China to purchase 24 Su-35 is not to bridge the gap
between Chinese and U.S. military power, but to show its sincerity to
consolidate its ties with Russia by offering economic incentives.
Strategically, they believe that the two nations face similar strategic
challenge posed by the U.S. and its allies: NATO expansion for Russia
and the U.S. conflicts with China over the Taiwan Strait. On the global
stage, they stand against American hegemony with sovereignty and
non-intervention as their core values.90

China's quick move closer to Russia has not convinced the Russian people
to believe that China is trustworthy in part because of the
inconsistency of Chinese foreign policy. China aligned with Russia in
the 1950s and with the U.S. in the 1970s but implemented a nonaligned
policy in the 1980s. In recent years, the Russian protests against the
Chinese economic invasion have taken place from time to time. The most
recent Russian protests took place in March 2019, which were triggered
by a China-funded project to bottle water from Russia's Lake Baikal that
has caused environmental problems and made Russian people very angry.
The Russian protests indicate that the China--Russia tie is fragile.91
China's move closer to Russia has received a lukewarm response from
public opinion in China. The Chinese people also have reasons to doubt
Moscow's sincerity. China is not happy that Russia has maintained close
military ties with and sold advanced weapons to India and Vietnam, both
are locked in territorial disputes with China.92 From a historical
perspective, Russia occupied China's territories totaling more than four
million square kilometers from 1689 to 1898, forced China to sign the
Yalta Agreement for recognizing Outer Mongolia as an independent country
in the 1940s, and stopped all financial and technological aid during the
Chinese economic crisis in the 1960s. Finally, Zhen Bao Island military
conflict in Heilongjiang Province broke out in 1969. Although in 1991
Russia acknowledged that the island belonged to China, the tension
between the two countries along the 2500 miles long border remained high
until the Chinese military troops retreated 500 km in 2008. In addition,
China cannot forget that Russia took the territories in northeast China
more than 100 years ago. On 2 July 2020, the Russian embassy in Beijing
posted a video of a party celebrating the 160th anniversary of the
founding of Vladivostok, which means "ruler of the east" in Russian and
was annexed from China by the Tsarist empire in 1860. The video reminded
the Chinese emotions over historic wounds and prompted an online
backlash with the posts such as "Today we can only endure, but the
Chinese people will remember!" "This ancestral land will return home in
the future!"93 In comparison with China--U.S. relations, the U.S. never
had a single territory dispute with China, so the Chinese people have
not had a similar historical complex toward the U.S. The mutual distrust
between China and Russia partially explains why Chinese students do not
enthusiastically choose to study in Russia. According to Russian media,
in 2020, only about 48,000 Chinese students studied in Russian
universities while 20,000 Russian students were in Chinese
universities.94 By contrast, more than 317,000 Chinese students enrolled
in U.S. institutions in 2020/21 regardless of Covid-19 spread across the
country. The list of other favorite destinations for Chinese students
does not include Russia, but Britain, Australia, Canada, Japan, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Korea. As a result,
Russian culture has little impact on Chinese society and intellectual
circle while American culture is very popular in China. The future of
Sino-Russia relations will be tested by public opinion in both
countries. It is expected that it would be difficult for both countries
to continue drawing closer without the support of the public opinion.

For now, the status of Sino-Russia relations is not a full-fledged
alliance, but a quasi-alliance. It seems that China and Russia are
closer than ever. Although a close relationship between China and Russia
could help China to get more advantage in bargaining with the U.S. to
smoothly solve its territorial disputes with neighboring countries, in
the long run, [[China will]{.mark} gain]{.underline} less but [**[lose
more]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [great power
[competition]{.mark} when China moves]{.underline} **[closer to
Russia]{.underline}**. Moscow and Beijing are on their honeymoon now,
but it may not last long. On the one hand, China's initial move closer
to Russia reflects that Chinese leaders lack confidence in dealing with
potential regional crises alone. Beijing does not necessarily have the
intention to save Russia, but it must save the Putin's regime in order
to retain Xi Jinping's power and the one-party system. On the other
hand, Russia will not satisfy with its lower position under Xi's
umbrella after Russia becomes significantly weaker because of the
failures of Putin's war with Ukraine. Russian ambassador already made it
clear that Russia does not seek an alliance with China. If China
unilaterally pursued the goal, the result would be poor. Therefore, it
is un-matured to predict that China and Russia will become alliances in
a decade. According to Schell-Shirk China Task Force, "China's alignment
is not set in stone. There are significant ways in which China's
long-term national interests are not, in fact, aligned with Russia's,
and deft U.S. diplomacy might still be able to find ways to temper
Beijing's alliance with Moscow."95 In the long term, Beijing and Moscow
might have more potential conflicts than cooperation and could become
main competitors or rivals down the road. [It is]{.underline} **[not
wise]{.underline}** [for Chinese leaders to]{.underline}
**[distance]{.underline}** themselves [from the U.S. by]{.underline}
**[overplaying]{.underline}** [the "Russian card."]{.underline}
Essentially, [China--[U.S. relations]{.mark} will [continue to be
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[top priority]{.underline}** [of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}['s foreign policy]{.underline}, when the CCP
carefully balances the triangle relations between China and the U.S. and
Russia.

Cold War with Chinese and American characteristics

We don't know precisely what the tastemakers, or whoever decides these
things, will call this Cold War. [We should **disqualify** Cold War 2.0
for its **frivolity** and]{.underline} the implicit
[suggestion]{.underline} that [we are dealing with]{.underline} an
**[upgrade]{.underline}**.

My preference is Cold War II, pronounced with the same stresses as World
War II, to remind us (1) of the destruction this rivalry could wreak if
it turns hot and (2) of continuities between the 1947-1991 contest and
the one that began in 2012. Just as many historians now view the two
world wars as a single conflict with a long intermission, we should see
the two Cold Wars as related phases in the evolution of world order in
the post-colonial and global eras.

But [continuities should not be]{.underline}
over**[emphasized]{.underline}**. There are factors unique to the Second
Cold War that will shape its prosecution and outcome:

- **[[Multilat]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}**, and what Fareed Zakaria
  called "The Rise of the Rest," [[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that
  [[neither China nor]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can aim for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
  kind of **[complete [victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [the
  U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [achieved in Cold War I.
  **[Allies]{.mark}**, **partners**, and **opponents**,
  with]{.underline} shifting degrees of [[**commitment** to
  **both**]{.mark} **powers**]{.underline}, now [have experience, tools,
  and agency that they did not have in]{.underline} the mid-[20th
  century. This will [enable them to **modify**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
  frustrate the [[strategies of both]{.mark} major powers]{.underline}
  in Cold War II. [**Multilateralism** will speak against]{.underline}
  the [formation of **blocs** and may involve both]{.underline} great
  [powers in]{.underline} networks of [**compromise** that **[deter
  aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

- Unless there is a military conflict, the legacy of 40 years of
  [Sino-US [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[put a **floor**
  under]{.underline}]{.mark} mutual [[hostility]{.mark}. **Engagement**
  will not cease]{.underline} altogether. Despite downward trends in
  public opinion, [Chinese and Americans]{.underline} have come to
  [know]{.underline} and like [each other **too well** for distrust to
  devolve into **hatred**]{.underline}. Chinese-Americans, who may face
  increased suspicion in Cold War II, will also play a key role in
  keeping lines of kinship and communication open and in reminding both
  sides---the United States in particular---of the historical benefits
  of openness and interaction.

- The legacy of the [first Cold War will]{.underline} also [inform
  conduct]{.underline} in the second. The world has done a version of
  this before: [We have **analyzed errors**, institutionalized
  **successful practices**, and socialized distrust of]{.underline} the
  propaganda and [motives of major powers]{.underline}. Nations are no
  wiser than they were in the second half of the 20th century, but, as
  Cold War veterans, [they are better equipped to
  **resist**]{.underline} traditional **[Cold War]{.underline}**
  tactics.

- [[China and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} both [be
  **distracted**]{.mark} from rivalry [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the large
  number of **[epochal [changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** whose
  simultaneous emergence is the distinguishing feature of the age. The
  [Rise of China is transformational]{.underline}---it compels us to
  reconsider our geopolitical assumptions---[but we are]{.underline}
  also [confronted with **equally great** challenges in other
  arenas:]{.underline} global [**[warming]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
  loss of **[biod]{.underline}**iversity; the [globalization of
  **[supply]{.mark} chains**, **[pathogens]{.mark}**, crime, ideas,
  information, economic disparity, and **[population]{.mark}
  flows**]{.underline}; the [emergence of **[new
  tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies, like synthetic biology and
  genetic engineering; and, on a longer timetable, [**revolutions** in
  gender roles and]{.underline} patterns of [belief]{.underline},
  including rising rates of secularism and religious extremism, that
  will reshape societies.

- We faced nothing of the kind in Cold War I. It's as if the rise of the
  United States, the little ice age, the extinction of the dinosaurs,
  the invention of moveable type, the Reformation, the Gilded Age and
  Great Depression, the Black Death, the Industrial Revolution, and the
  discovery of the germ theory of disease all appeared worldwide in a
  50-year span. Due to the concurrence of these epochal shifts,
  [managing US-China competition]{.underline}---which is the world's
  greatest geopolitical challenge---[may not be the **greatest
  challenge** we confront]{.underline}. The United States and China will
  face pressures to compromise and cooperate during the Second Cold War
  that the United States and Soviet Union did not experience during the
  first. [Meeting these challenges]{.underline}, moreover, [[will
  **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the resources and
  **[attention]{.underline}** that [Washington and Beijing]{.underline}
  can [dedicate to]{.underline} their
  **[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

- While the stakes of Cold War II are high, [[full-bore]{.mark}
  strategic [rivalry]{.mark} may **[never gather]{.mark} steam** [due
  to]{.mark}]{.underline} both nations' **[domestic
  [fragility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Political
  [**[polarization]{.mark}** and international perceptions
  of]{.underline} its failures and [unreliability]{.underline}
  ~~cripple~~ \[**[[devastate]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [[the
  U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as a global
  actor. [[China]{.mark} is [constrained by **geography**
  and]{.mark}]{.underline} by a number of [intractable
  problems]{.underline}, any one of [which could force it to
  **curtail**]{.underline} its [**global ambitions** and turn
  inward:]{.underline} corporate and government [**[debt]{.mark}**; an
  **aging population** and insufficient social safety net]{.underline};
  **[corruption]{.underline}**; **[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
  air, water, and soil; the **[water shortage]{.underline}** in the
  north; stark **[economic disparities]{.underline}**; global resistance
  to Chinese influence; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[sclerotic
  [political system]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is [out of step with a
  modern populace]{.underline}. While these
  [[weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark} might cause either country to lash
  out at the other to build popular support, they could also
  [[**convince** leaders to make **accommodations**]{.underline}]{.mark}
  in the future that they would not consider today.

In the opening sentence of Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger wrote that "in
every century there seems to emerge a country with the power, the will,
and the intellectual and moral impetus to shape the entire international
system in accordance with its own values." [Many]{.underline} Chinese
would [read]{.underline} that line as an [anointing of]{.underline} the
People's Republic of [**China** for the 21st century. They would be
**wrong**. While [China]{.mark} has the **will** to shape]{.underline}
the [international system]{.underline}, its [[power]{.mark} is
**[uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and its [intellectual and moral
[preparation is **non-existent**]{.mark}]{.underline} to insufficient.
The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is still]{.mark} the world's **[most powerful]{.mark}
nation**]{.underline}, but it must undergo a protracted and uncertain
healing process before it is fit to reassert

[There are]{.underline} a number of **[[formidable
restraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in place to keep the
peace]{.underline}. The United States has worked hard over the decades
to build these barriers---often as part of the very engagement strategy
that Mearsheimer criticizes. [These bulwarks have [helped preserve
peace]{.mark} and promote prosperity [for]{.mark}]{.underline} the last
[**[70 years]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} they [are **still strong
enough**]{.mark}]{.underline} to prevent a **[[U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although [accidents or
incidents]{.underline} connected to military brinkmanship may occur,
they [would **almost certainly not**]{.underline} lead [to a wider
**[war]{.mark}**. That [would require]{.mark}]{.underline} something
exceedingly unlikely: [[the **simultaneous failure of every
restraint**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

First, [bilateral [diplomacy would have to **break
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engagement is the opposite of estrangement,
which describes the absence of U.S.-Chinese relations from 1949 to 1972.
The purpose of engagement is to forestall misperceptions, provide
reassurance, and prevent conflict. It is true that diplomacy and
communication between China and the United States have been anemic for
the past five years. And it is difficult to discern authoritative policy
amid the current cacophony of diplomatic posturing on Twitter and
elsewhere, creating an environment ripe for confusion and overreaction.
But these deficiencies are not structural; they can be remedied. If
top-level leaders in both countries consistently communicate and work to
reduce public posturing, as they should, then the diplomatic barriers to
war can be reinforced.

For a war to break out, [the international system would also have to
fail. China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are
connected to [a **global network** of]{.mark} [**countries** and
**institutions**]{.mark} that [have]{.mark}]{.underline} a stake---in
some cases, [[an **existential stake**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in
**preventing conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} between these two
countries. Almost [**[every government]{.mark}** and **institution** on
the globe [would be **grievously damaged**]{.mark} by a U.S.-Chinese
war]{.underline}, and so [they [**all** would]{.mark} try to
[prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} an imminent [[conflict through
**diplomatic pressure**, **mediation**, or]{.underline}]{.mark} acts of
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as denying overflight and
basing rights. Critics may be quick to deny the influence of others in
heading off a major-power clash. But in the current international
system, there is no way for either side to emerge victorious, and those
outside China and the United States would see this most clearly.

[Then there is the restraint created by **globalization**]{.underline}.
Mearsheimer argues that it was a catastrophic mistake for the United
States to help China grow wealthy, as its resulting strength will
inevitably lead it to challenge the United States. But it is also
plausible that [[the]{.mark} inextricably [integrated]{.mark} nature of
the [global economy]{.mark}, and **specifically** of the Chinese and
U.S. economies, [makes **any war unwinnable**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
thus [acts as a **deterrent to conflict**]{.underline}. It is true, as
critics will point out, that economic dependencies failed to prevent
[World War I]{.underline}. But [the economic relations of the early
twentieth century were **nothing like** the **complex entanglements** of
today's international economic system. In]{.underline} the case of
[China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [they
[create]{.mark}]{.underline} a situation of **[mutual [assured economic
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Another restraint is **public opinion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
on the U.S. side. [[Politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United
States respond to various incentives, but they [**[cannot
ignore]{.mark}** the sentiments of their [voters]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And [[after a **20-year fight** against terrorism, the]{.mark} American
[public is]{.mark}]{.underline} decidedly [[**wary** of]{.mark}
**protracted** and **costly [overseas conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
If U.S. policymakers appeared poised for a conflict with China, one
would also expect that the press, having learned its lesson from the war
in Iraq, would perform its watchdog function, question the official
narratives, and activate public concern.

[All these barriers]{.underline} should work to [prevent]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline}. [But if they **somehow didn't**, [there is a
**final fail-safe**]{.mark} that is **even harder** to imagine not
working]{.underline}: military **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Taiwan is the most likely issue over which a U.S.-Chinese war could
break out. But [the quantity and quality of [the weaponry]{.mark} on
both sides [translates to **certain catastrophic losses**]{.mark} for
**all**, which should provide a sufficient deterrent to
war]{.underline}. And because the devastation of a conflict over Taiwan
would spiral out of control quickly, one cannot rule out the use of
nuclear weapons. Strange as it may sound, that is good news: just as the
nuclear age prevented direct military conflict between the Soviet Union
and the United States for more than 40 years, so it should between
[[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, both of which [[are
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}-armed [[powers with]{.mark} survivable
[second-strike capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although China has
many fewer missiles and warheads than the United States---something
China is working on remedying---the doctrine of
**[m]{.underline}**utually **[a]{.underline}**ssured
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [still operates]{.underline}. **[[The
balance of terror holds]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Companies won't drill in the Arctic

#### Opening leases won't lead to more drilling -- oil prices are too cheap to justify it. Even if there was a need for production, it would happen in cheaper areas. And, if leases do get taken, they would not be utilized.

[Tristan **Baurick**](https://grist.org/author/tristan-baurick/)
Regional Reporter, Louisiana Jan 31 **2025** Trump wants more drilling,
but the oil market is already saturated
https://grist.org/energy/trump-wants-more-drilling-but-the-oil-market-is-already-saturated/

Oil companies cheered Trump's recent calls for a more streamlined
process and a series of energy-related executive orders he signed this
month. The orders declared an "energy emergency," expanded drilling in
the Arctic and repealed Biden's ban on drilling off the East and West
coasts and parts of Alaska. "Directing regulators to expand access to
resources \[and\] streamline permitting processes ... will help deliver
a stronger, more prosperous energy future for all Americans," Mike
Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a
statement last week. "This is a new day for American energy, and we
applaud President Trump for moving swiftly to chart a new path where
U.S. oil and natural gas are embraced, not restricted." But [[industry
leaders have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[been clear
that]{.underline}]{.mark} these and other [[policy
changes]{.underline}]{.mark} floated by Trump [[won't lead to more
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The U.S. is already producing more
crude oil than any country, ever,]{.underline}]{.mark} according to the
EIA. Last year's production rate of 13 million barrels per day was a new
record high, surpassing the previous record set in 2023. "I don't think
today that production in the U.S. is constrained," ExxonMobil CEO Darren
Woods told Semafor in November. "So, I don't know that there's an
opportunity to unleash a lot of production in the near term, because
most operators in the U.S. are \[already\] optimizing their production
today." In essence, [[oil is just too cheap to justify more drilling. If
prices do go up, companies are likely to tap into Permian Basin shale in
Texas and New Mexico rather than seek offshore reserves, which cost more
to drill,]{.underline}]{.mark} according to industry analysts. But that
doesn't mean companies won't snap up even more offshore leases if
they're offered, Daigle said. "[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} of these
([[leases]{.underline}]{.mark}) might be drilled in the future, but many
[[are being held just so somebody else doesn't lease
them]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said. [[Companies may also stockpile
leases to raise funds from investors,]{.underline}]{.mark} or they may
simply be playing "mind games" with competitors. Buying up leases in one
area of the Gulf can sometimes throw rival drillers off the scent of
richer deposits elsewhere, Daigle said.

#### Companies won't drill in the Arctic -- lacks infrastructure and is not profitable -- the last time leases were opened, no companies bid

https://www.americanprogress.org/article/opening-more-lands-and-waters-for-oil-drilling-wont-lower-energy-prices/

Under the Biden administration, oil and gas production reached [record
highs](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-BIDEN/OIL/lgpdngrgkpo/).
[[Oil and gas companies get to choose the federal lands they want to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark}, and they have largely locked up and
capitalized on all the major sources of oil. [[Many of the places where
President Trump and Congress are proposing mandated lease sales are in
extreme areas that industry and Americans have decided are not worth
drilling---such as America's Arctic, which doesn't have existing
infrastructure but does have [sensitive polar bear and caribou
habitat](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-101/)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The last lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge]{.underline}]{.mark}---mandated by Congress during President
Trump's first term---[[[received no
bids]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement-lack-of-bids-for-arctic-refuge-shows-failure-of-drill-baby-drill-strategy/)
[[from oil and gas companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, his
current actions aim to
[reverse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/)
[protections](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/president-biden-takes-action-protect-americas-coastlines-future-oil-and-gas-leasing)
from ocean drilling in places such as the East Coast and Florida, which
could mean leases in places where [communities,
governors](https://usa.oceana.org/climate-and-energy-grassroots-opposition-offshore-drilling-and-exploration-atlantic-ocean-and-3/),
and [members of
Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/31/why-florida-republicans-dont-want-drilling-off-their-own-coast/)
have been vocally opposed to drilling.

#### The oil market is saturated -- companies won't spend any money drilling because it would push prices down. 

[Tristan **Baurick**](https://grist.org/author/tristan-baurick/)
Regional Reporter, Louisiana Jan 31 **2025** Trump wants more drilling,
but the oil market is already saturated
https://grist.org/energy/trump-wants-more-drilling-but-the-oil-market-is-already-saturated/

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald Trump's [[calls to
"[drill, baby, drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuzIuclViaU),"
many oil companies]{.underline}]{.mark} operating in the Gulf of Mexico
[[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely do what they've done for years: [[sit
on]{.underline}]{.mark} hundreds of [[untapped oil
leases]{.underline}]{.mark} across millions of acres. Trump has
repeatedly said eliminating barriers to drilling will unlock vast
untapped reserves of "liquid gold" and ignite a new era of national
prosperity. But [[most of the drilling leases]{.underline}]{.mark}
already [[granted to companies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the oil-rich Gulf
[[are idle and unused]{.underline}]{.mark}, and they'll stay that way
until the United States' record-breaking production rates wane and the
high costs of drilling offshore drop precipitously. Of the 2,206 active
leases in the Gulf, only a fifth are producing oil, according to records
from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which regulates offshore
drilling. Oil industry executives and analysts say [[the current number
of 448 oil-producing leases is unlikely to grow significantly, even if
Trump makes good on promises to expand leasing opportunities and
expedite drilling permits]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The market is
saturated with oil, making companies reluctant to spend more money
drilling because the added product will likely push prices down, cutting
into profits]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[It's not the regulations that are
getting in the way, it's the economics]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Hugh
Daigle, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas
in Austin. "It's true that there are a bunch of undeveloped leases in
the Gulf, and it'll stay that way if we continue to see low or stagnant
oil prices."

#### Companies won't invest -- no matter what the government does, it can't make it not risky or profitable

Art **Phillips,** Feb 6 **2025** Trump's order to boost drilling called
'a massive corporate grab of Alaskan resources\'
https://news.oilandgaswatch.org/post/trumps-order-to-boost-drilling-called-a-massive-corporate-grab-of-alaskan-resources

[[Philip Wight, an energy and environmental historian at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks, said]{.underline}]{.mark} the Biden administration
in general ensured ample access to fossil fuel resources on public lands
throughout Alaska. "Despite vociferous rhetoric claiming that the Biden
Administration was intent on keeping Alaskan oil in the ground, evidence
from the past four years demonstrates the opposite," he said. Wight said
the Trump Administration is trying to revive Alaska's fossil energy
fortunes and trying to make "Alaska Great Again" like the oil boom of
1979-1983. "But [[the world has changed]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said.
"[[The center of gravity of the oil industry is no longer in Alaska,
it's in the Permian Basin]{.underline}]{.mark} \[in Texas and New
Mexico\] [[and lower 48 shale plays. The government]{.underline}]{.mark}
can offer a lot of subsidies and acreage for lease, but it [[can't turn
back time or force oil majors to invest in a risky resource
frontier." ]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Companies, like ExxonMobil, have already announced they won't drill in the Arctic

[Ellen
**Montgomery**](https://environmentamerica.org/center/people/ellen-montgomery-0/)
Director, Great Outdoors Campaign, Environment America Research & Policy
Center April 17 **2023** Statement: ExxonMobil tells shareholders: no
plans to drill in the Arctic
https://environmentamerica.org/center/media-center/statement-exxonmobil-tells-shareholders-no-plans-to-drill-in-the-arctic/

[[ExxonMobil
[informed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000034088/000119312523100079/d429320ddef14a.htm#toc429320_31)
its shareholders]{.underline}]{.mark} last week that [[the company has
no plans for new oil and gas exploration or development
in]{.underline}]{.mark} Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or the
rest of [[the arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}. In response to a
shareholder resolution asking the company to report on the impact of
arctic drilling, [[ExxonMobil responded "ExxonMobil does not hold any
active leases and is not pursuing any active
developments]{.underline}]{.mark} within the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge." The coastal plain is the calving ground of the porcupine
caribou herd, important habitat for migratory birds and is sacred to the
Gwich'in people. The oil company also shared that "\[[[ExxonMobil's\]
current investment plans do not include exploration activity within the
Arctic [Monitoring and Assessment
Program](https://www.amap.no/about/geographical-coverage)]{.underline}]{.mark}
(AMAP) region, [[and we plan relatively limited investment to sustain
our existing interests in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}." The AMAP
region includes the western Arctic, the area where the Willow Project is
located. The Biden administration recently
[announced](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-sweeping-protections-16-million-acres-land-and)
plans for a process that could protect up to 13 millions acres of land
there, including the Teshekpuk Lake area, which is also a critical
habitat for caribou and other wildlife. There was a lease sale held for
tracts on the coastal plain
[2021](https://environmentamerica.org/center/media-center/alaska-industrial-development-and-export-authority-wins-majority-of-bids-in-wrong-headed-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-lease-sale/)
with only one oil company participating. The Congressional Budget Office
had projected revenues from arctic refuge lease sales at \$1.8 billion
but the 2021 sale raised just over \$14 million, less than 1 percent of
the projected revenue. Since 2021, [all but one
leaseholder](https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/oil-companies-are-pulling-out-of-the-arctic-refuge-lets-make-sure-they-never-go-back/)
has pulled out of the refuge and Chevron and Hilcorp paid \$10 million
to exit their lease for a test well in a different area of the Arctic
Refuge.

#### Huge infrastructure challenges exist to offshore drilling -- for example, the Liberty project failed because of shale formations that impede access.

Yereth **Rosen** - February 21, **2025** 5:00 am Trump order opening
Arctic Alaska waters to oil leasing draws legal challenge
https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/02/21/trump-order-opening-arctic-alaska-waters-to-oil-leasing-draws-legal-challenge/

[[There is one oil development project that was pending in federal
Arctic waters, but it is now stalled and possibly
dead:]{.underline}]{.mark} a Beaufort Sea field called
[Liberty](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/04/10/liberty-an-ambitious-offshore-oil-project-that-once-sparked-excitement-is-now-in-limbo/).
The Liberty project, with 150 million barrels of oil, was being pursued
by Hilcorp. But Biden administration regulators last month [rejected
Hilcorp's
request](https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/01/08/interior-agency-rejects-hilcorp-request-for-more-time-to-develop-arctic-alaska-offshore-oil-field/)
for extra time to pursue a new development concept. It would have been
the 12th extension for leases that were originally sold decades ago and
that Hilcorp's predecessor, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., in the early
2000s tried to develop into a producing field.
[[Hilcorp]{.underline}]{.mark}, in its application for a "suspension of
production" approval that effectively halts lease development deadlines,
[[said it is dropping its plan to build an artificial island as the new
drill site]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, it is seeking to return to a
plan to use ultra-extended-reach wells to drill from existing land. BP
had tried that concept but found it unfeasible. One Alaska oil and gas
expert said Hilcorp's reversion to the BP plan is puzzling. "I don't
know why they walked away from the island," said Mark Myers, a former
commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, former
director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas and director of the U.S.
Geological Survey. Myers was commenting after the Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement denied Hilcorp's request but before Trump
issued his executive orders. Myers, who is now a
[member](https://www.arctic.gov/mark-meyers/) of the U.S. Arctic
Research Commission, said [[geology is one reason why the BP plan did
not work. There is a layer of shale, a formation called
[Kingak](https://mrdata.usgs.gov/sim3340/show-sim3340.php?seq=B128.2&src=ML009_2042),
that poses extraordinary challenges to any directional
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said. Myers said the Bureau of Safety
and Environmental Enforcement, the federal agency that denied Hilcorp's
extension request, was probably justified in that decision. "It looks to
me like Hilcorp could have been more diligent, and BSEE got fed up," he
said. [[The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management now lists the Liberty
leases as
"[expired](https://www.data.boem.gov/Leasing/Files/1221ak.pdf)."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Companies won't move to the arctic -- oil and gas drilling in the other locations, like the gulf, has developed infrastructure and is profitable

Brendan **Gibbons February 13, 2025** Trump's proposal to expand
offshore drilling is unpopular in key Republican states
https://news.oilandgaswatch.org/post/critics-call-trumps-proposal-to-expand-offshore-drilling-unnecessary-and-unpopular-in-key-republican-states

[[Oil and gas companies will likely continue to focus on the Gulf of
Mexico, where 97 percent of U.S. offshore oil and gas is
produced]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management. [[In the Gulf, the industry has developed a network of
pipelines]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly off the coasts of Texas and
Louisiana, where production began ramping up in the 1930s and 1940s.
"[[I think there's appetite for continued development in the
Gulf]{.underline}]{.mark}," Kovscek said.

#### No chance of Arctic offshore development. Oil demand is declining and even a dramatic shift back would have a difficult time generating interest.

No economic interest in offshore oil drilling in Western Canadian
Arctic, say experts
https://www.nnsl.com/news/no-economic-interest-in-offshore-oil-drilling-in-western-canadian-arctic-say-experts-7273355

"The vast majority of oil sands production in 2050 is from oil sands
facilities already producing," said communications officer Karen
Ryhorchuk, who noted the federal government's projections may in fact be
too optimistic for oil futures. "[[Recent global net-zero
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the IEA's "Net Zero by 2050"
report, [[show rapidly declining global oil demand]{.underline}]{.mark},
which could lead to significantly lower Canadian production levels
compared to our Evolving Policies Scenario. Future global climate policy
and its effect on global crude oil demand and prices will have direct
impacts on Canadian oil production."

Matthews noted [[with the global marketplace rapidly shifting away from
fossil fuels in an effort to stave off runaway climate change, high-risk
projects will have an extremely difficult time generating interest among
oil producers going forward]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Even if the federal
government made a dramatic shift back to fossil fuel development, the
chances of that development actually happening is
nil]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Companies won't drill in the Arctic -- even when leases have been offered no one showed to bid on them -- doesn't make economic sense

8, **2023**, 11:30 AM CDT The oil industry's cynical gamble on Arctic
drilling Companies like ConocoPhillips are banking on a future filled
with oil.
https://www.vox.com/climate/23863150/biden-arctic-drilling-big-oil

[[Even when the Trump administration offered up
ANWR]{.underline}]{.mark} land [[on a platter]{.underline}]{.mark} with
a lease sale late into its term, [[few companies bothered to show.
"Basically no major oil companies came to bid at that lease
sale,"]{.underline}]{.mark} said Miller. "For years we had been saying
that this is an area that was too special, too fragile, to develop, but
also that [[it didn't make sense economically]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
that's exactly what the results showed." Chevron and Hilcorp have
abandoned the ANWR tract they acquired under Trump, entirely
voluntarily. For much of the 2010s, companies had soured on developing
expensive oil prospects. Prices have climbed again in the past few
years, however, as a result of embargoes on Russian oil and the petering
out of shale oil development (and as a global commodity, oil is much
more than the Exxons and BPs of the world; 55 percent of global oil is
supplied by state-owned oil companies, like in Saudi Arabia and Russia).

#### No chance of the price of oil staying high long enough to justify the cost of offshore drilling in the Arctic

Eric **Bowling**, Local Journalism Initiative Feb 27, **2023** 12:30 AM
No economic interest in offshore oil drilling in Western Canadian
Arctic, say experts
https://www.nnsl.com/news/no-economic-interest-in-offshore-oil-drilling-in-western-canadian-arctic-say-experts-7273355

Energy analyst Doug Matthews described [[the likelihood of the price of
oil staying high enough for a long enough period of time to justify the
high costs of offshore drilling in the Arctic as slim to
none.]{.underline}]{.mark} "The issue isn't just the price of oil but
how long it will stay at the hoped-for price," he said. "[[Offshore
exploration projects can take more than 15 years to reach production so
the important number is the best estimate of oil prices in 15 years, not
today]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Depending on your source, [[oil demand is
expected to decline from today's average]{.underline}]{.mark} of 100
million barrels per day to half that by 2035 (International Energy
Agency) or 2050 (Saudi Aramco). The date may change but the direction
appears set to lower demand."

#### Companies won't drill in the Arctic

Sheila **Dang and** Valerie **Volcovici 2025**. "Oil industry unlikely
to rush to Alaska despite Trump\'s call to drill" Accessed July 3.
https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-industry-unlikely-rush-alaska-despite-trumps-call-drill-2025-01-23

HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - [U.S. oil and gas companies are
unlikely to expand development in Alaska and the Arctic]{.mark}
following President Donald Trump\'s executive order enabling them to do
so, company officials and industry representatives told Reuters, noting
a future president could easily reverse Trump\'s move. [U.S. oil
production is]{.mark} already [at record levels due]{.mark} largely
[to]{.mark} increased [production in]{.mark} more accessible areas like
[Texas and New Mexico,]{.mark} and companies have limited spending on
new projects to focus on returning cash to shareholders. [Analysts said
drillers may not be in a hurry to]{.mark} take advantage of Trump\'s
order on Monday titled \"Unleashing Alaska's extraordinary resource
potential.\", The executive order would reopen vast areas for
[drill]{.mark}ing and mining, and expedite permits for projects, part of
Trump\'s sweeping plan to maximize oil and gas production while
reversing former President Joe Biden\'s policies encouraging the
transition to renewable energy sources to fight climate change.
