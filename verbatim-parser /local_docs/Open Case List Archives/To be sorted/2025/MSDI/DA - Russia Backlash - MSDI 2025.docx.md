height="6.4375in"}

#### Thesis of the DA:

Russia is happy with the current Arctic Hierarchy (the one where they
are on top). They are willing to cooperate with the U.S. and others in
the arctic as long as the U.S. doesn't expand beyond their current
operations. Anything more can be a threat to Russia's economic and
military power in the region.

The aff is an extension of Arctic operations which Russia perceives as a
threat. This prompts Russia to act fast to protect its arctic assets,
specifically it's nuclear second-strike capabilities.

I think you can guess where this is going...

Russia strikes the U.S., the U.S. strikes back, allies get involved and
suddenly we are in a nuclear Armageddon.

Oh, and this all causes extinction (duh).

#### What should a 2NC look like?

Keep the story of the DA going, elaborate on how/why Russia is upset and
starts war. Read cards that explain the link story. Respond to the 2AC
through line-by-line answers.

Be sure to answer any impact defense or turns!!

#### What should a 2NR look like?

Think about what you need to win to win the debate. Focus on a specific
impact and how the aff triggers it. Think about the big picture and why
this is the most important thing we should take from it.

Is that nuclear extinction? Nuclear waste contamination? Why is the DA
is not thumped? Etc...

despite geopolitical tensions\",

[Geopolitical [rivalries]{.mark} are [intensify]{.mark}ing [in the
Arctic, but Russia]{.mark} is [willing to cooperate with]{.mark} foreign
partners]{.underline}, [including from [the West]{.mark}]{.underline},
[in economic ventures there that will benefit all sides, Russian
President Vladimir Putin has said.]{.underline}

In a major speech on Thursday, Putin said US President Donald Trump's
stated intention to acquire Greenland was "serious", and it was clear
that the US would continue to promote its interests in the Arctic. The
Greenland question had nothing to do with Russia, he said.

But [Moscow]{.underline} was [concerned]{.underline} that "[NATO
countries]{.underline} in general [are increasingly designating the far
north as a springboard for possible conflicts]{.underline}, practising
the use of troops in these conditions, including by their 'new
recruits', Finland and Sweden," he said, referring to the alliance's
newest members.

[Russia was monitoring the situation and building a response, including
by boosting its military capabilities in the region.]{.underline} "We
will not allow encroachments on the sovereignty of our country and will
reliably protect our national interests," Putin said.

Reporting from Moscow, Yulia Shapovalova said the
[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} president's [[priority is
developing]{.mark} the region's [infrastructure]{.mark} to improve
people's living condition [and]{.mark} to get better [access to]{.mark}
the natural [resources of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["Putin sees many prospects for further development of the region -- the
most important direction is the strengthening of transport and logistics
in the Arctic,"]{.underline} she said.

"[Russia is also keen to develop the Northern Sea Route]{.underline},
which is the shortest shipping route connecting western Eurasia with the
Asia Pacific region -- [[but]{.mark} the country [is not going to
\[do\]]{.mark} go [it alone]{.mark}. [It's ready to cooperate,]{.mark}
ready for prospects in the Arctic,]{.underline}" Shapovalova said.

Focus on the Arctic's strategic importance for mining, shipping and
security has increased sharply because of repeated statements by Trump
that he wants to acquire Greenland. He has not ruled out doing so by
force.

The Arctic holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the
seabed that could become more accessible with global warming. It is also
an area of military competition, where defence analysts say Russia has
built up its presence much faster than the West by reopening Soviet-era
bases and modernising its navy.

[The US sees the Arctic as crucial for national security, including for
its early warning system against nuclear attacks.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin says the Arctic is a zone of [Russia]{.mark}n strategic
interest, and [suggested]{.mark} in February [that Russia and the US
could work together]{.mark} to develop natural resources there as the
two countries pursue a fast-moving rapprochement that has unnerved
Ukraine and its European allies.]{.underline}

#### But U.S. expansion disrupts [any]{.underline} form of cooperation -- prompts Russia to use aggression to protect second strike capabilities

[Alongside the [cooperative line in]{.mark} the [Arctic,]{.mark} which
mostly resembles the policy of a [status quo]{.mark} [power]{.mark},
Russia has been building up its military forces in the
Arctic]{.underline}--- as it has in large parts of the country[.
Russia's security interests in the Arctic are not singled out in one
publicly available document, but are reflected in its Arctic strategies,
following the overall lines in Russia's military doctrines]{.underline}
from 2010 and 2014 and its National Security Strategy from 2015
(Rossiskaya Gazeta 2015; The President of the Russian Federation 2010,
2014). [Judging from the Arctic strategies from 2008 and 2013, [Russia's
security interests in the Arctic are subordinate to the civilian]{.mark}
interest in securing the Russian Arctic as a resource base for the
Russian economy.]{.underline} The Arctic strategy from 2013 states that
[Russia's security interests]{.underline} in the Arctic are the
provision of 'favourable operation conditions', [maintaining the
'necessary level of combat readiness' of Russia's armed forces in the
area. 'Ensure comprehensive combat and mobilization readiness level' to
prevent 'non-military pressure and aggression against the Russian
Federation and its allies', 'ensure the sovereign rights of Russia's
Arctic',]{.underline} [provide 'strategic deterrence' and, 'in the event
of armed conflict, repel aggression and obtain a cessation of
hostilities on terms that meet the interests of Russian
Federation']{.underline} (The President of the Russian Federation 2013:
18). [The Foreign Policy Concept from 2016 states that]{.underline}
'[[Russia will be firm in countering any attempts to introduce]{.mark}
elements of [political or military confrontation in the
Arctic']{.mark}]{.underline} (The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2016: 76).
In plain text: [[Russia will react if the US]{.mark} and/or NATO
countries [start building up forces or become more active in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia's naval strategy from 2017 states
that [among existing and emerging threats (opasnosti) is the 'aspiration
of a range of states, primarily the United States of America (USA) and
its allies, to dominate on the World Ocean]{.underline}, [including the
Arctic, and to achieve overwhelming superiority of their naval
forces']{.underline}. [Another threat mentioned here is the aspiration
of a range of states to secure for themselves access to hydrocarbon
resources, including in the Arctic]{.underline} (The President of the
Russian Federation 2017). As the chief of the general staff, Valery
Gerasimov, has put it, [there is a risk of enhanced [competition
over]{.mark} the world's [resources]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}
(Gerasimov 2013). And this [competition also affects the
Arctic]{.underline}. As Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu stated in
2015: A 'broad spectrum of potential challenges and threats to our
national security is now being formed in the Arctic' (Bender 2015). In
2018, Shoigu argued [that competition among the Arctic states [could
lead to conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shoigu 2018b). The
[[Arctic]{.mark} [is the home]{.mark} [base]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a large
part of [Russia's nuclear deterrence capability]{.mark}]{.underline},
[which is the main component in securing its great power
position]{.underline}. Thus, [the Arctic functions as the deployment
area for Russia's strategic air force, and the Arctic is home to a large
part of Russia's sea-based strategic deterrent in the Northern Fleet,
approximately [60% of its]{.mark} sea-based nuclear
[warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}8 (Åtland 2014: 153, 2018). 8The remaining
around 40% of Russia's sea-based strategic nuclear weapons are placed at
the Russian Pacific Fleet's SSBN's, which are based at Vilyuchinsk at
Kamptjatka. They also occasionally operate in Arctic Waters (Åtland
2018). 10 J. Staun The Russian Northern Fleet, which is also the home of
Russia's latest military district, North (Server), and the HQ Joint
Strategic Command (JSC), has its bases in the European part of the
Russian Arctic. The headquarters is in Severomorsk close to Murmansk and
is supplemented by several bases along the coast of the Kola Peninsula
and in the White Sea. The Barents Sea, as an access route from the White
Sea to the Atlantic Ocean[, is especially important to Russia from a
strategic viewpoint---since the Gulf Stream ensures that the ports in
the north can be accessed all year round.]{.underline} Here the Northern
Fleet can access the Atlantic, possibly under the nose of NATO, unlike
Russia's Baltic Sea and Black Sea Fleets. [[Russia's main]{.mark}
military [objective in the Arctic]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to ensure the
survivability of [its second-strike]{.mark} nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is done by a combination of
perimeter defence of the Kola Peninsula and through the so-called
'Bastion' defence concept. The Bastion concept encompasses a region
which "extends from the Kola Peninsula towards the Barents Sea and the
Norwegian Sea and further west to the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom
(GUIK) gap" (Boulègue 2019: 7). [Control of the area is sought through
sea denial and interdiction capabilities in order to secure the area as
an area of operation for the nuclear powered ballistic missile
submarines (SSBNs).]{.underline} The prospect of diminishing seasonal
ice has opened up the possibility that the Arctic Sea in the long run
can be used to move forces from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean or the
other way around, which further increases its importance. [The
[melting]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, which until now has
[[made the]{.underline}]{.mark} northern flank inaccessible to foreign
forces, may in the future lead to a situation, where the [[northern
flank]{.mark} is [more]{.mark} open and [vulnerable]{.mark} to
attacks]{.underline} from surface and subsurface ships against critical
infrastructure. [Most importantly[, Russia sees]{.mark} sea-based
anti-ballistic missile ([ABM) systems]{.mark} in the Arctic [as a
potential threat]{.mark} to its second-strike capability.]{.underline}
In February 2011, General Nikolai Makarov, then Chief of the Russian
General Staff, said that [[Russia 'will not accept that U.S.
Vessels]{.underline}]{.mark} equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile
Defense System operation [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} our part of [[the
Arctic']{.underline}]{.mark} (Åtland 2014: 151). A side effect of the
melting sea ice is also that the 'protective ice cover', underneath
which the submarine fleet has so far been able to hide, slowly vanishes,
affecting Russia's naval doctrine. The change in accessibility and lack
of 'ice cover' will in the coming years make it imperative for Russia to
enhance its forces on the northern shores, especially around the Kola
Peninsula and in the White and Kara Seas, with a view to securing its
second-strike capability. [Furthermore,]{.underline} [as the Russian
Arctic develops into a resource base for the Russian economy, the
necessity of protecting critical infrastructure in the area from attacks
becomes more important.]{.underline} Therefore, we will most likely see
a build-up of Russian A2/AD capabilities along the northern shores,
especially in the north-west.

[[The Varied Roads to Armageddon]{.mark}:]{.underline} Unpacking the
Use-It-Or-Lose-It Dilemma

[The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has long been a staple of theorizing
about deterrence and nuclear weapons. It has undergirded explanations
for everything from strategic stability and escalation dynamics to
nuclear strategy and arms control]{.underline}. The dilemma appears, at
first glance, highly intuitive, and scholars have typically employed it
without further elaboration, confident that both they and the reader
appreciate its underlying logic. However, upon closer inspection, the
dilemma and the escalatory pressures it is believed to produce, are more
puzzling, if not wholly irrational. Here, I resolve the puzzle inherent
in the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma by identifying the [various mechanisms
by which it can encourage nuclear use]{.underline}, sketching three
non-rational mechanisms and more fully elaborating three rational
mechanisms. Disaggregating and specifying these mechanisms enriches our
understanding of a concept ubiquitous in the literature and sheds new
light on potential escalation dynamics in an interstate crisis or
conflict.

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has long been a staple of theorizing about
deterrence and nuclear weapons. It has undergirded explanations for
everything from strategic stability and escalation dynamics to nuclear
strategy and arms control. The dilemma appears, at first glance, highly
intuitive, and scholars have typically employed it without further
elaboration, confident that both they and the reader appreciate its
underlying logic. [However, upon closer inspection, the dilemma and the
escalatory pressures it is believed to produce, are more puzzling, if
not wholly irrational.]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} the simple, implicit model of [the use-it-or-lose-it
dilemma]{.mark}, two nuclear-armed states confront one another in a
crisis or conflict.]{.underline} For at least [[one]{.underline}]{.mark}
of those states, the survivability of its nuclear arsenal is so fragile
that the adversary [[could execute a disarming first
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this situation, the [nuclear inferior
state faces a Sophie\'s choice. It can launch its nuclear arsenal now,
inviting certain and destructive retaliation by the adversary. Or it can
wait and risk certain and equally destructive disarmament.]{.underline}
Scholars have reflexively interpreted this situation as [[encouraging
nuclear first use]{.mark} on the part of the weaker state under the
assumption that it is better to strike than not.]{.underline} But, upon
closer examination, the decision to launch now offers no benefits. If
the weaker state uses its nuclear weapons, its deterrent its expended
and it is exposed to certain destruction from the adversary. On the
other hand, [if it does not expend its arsenal, it risks having its
arsenal preemptively destroyed, again eliminating its deterrent and
exposing it to certain destruction from the adversary.]{.underline} The
state is [damned if it does, damned if it doesn\'t.]{.underline}
Presented in this way, the dilemma may encourage a nuclear strike, but
not for wholly rational reasons. Although much of the scholarly
literature has grappled with the inherent challenges of credibility and
rationality posed by nuclear weapons, scholars deploying the
use-it-or-lose-it dilemma in their analyses rarely specify the
underlying logic driving it. Further, in failing to articulate or
interrogate that logic, scholars and policy
[[analysts]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[missed important variation in the
pathways from the dilemma to nuclear escalation]{.mark}. The
[use-it-or-lose-it]{.mark} dilemma [is real and]{.mark}, in various
forms, [can encourage]{.mark} the [use of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s for
irrational, arational, and rational]{.mark} strategic
[reasons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Here, I describe that variation by identifying the various mechanisms by
which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma can promote nuclear use. I sketch
three non-rational mechanisms and more fully discuss three rational
mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms have previously been identified in
the literature, whether explicitly or implicitly. However, scholars who
invoke the concept to explain interstate crisis or conflict dynamics
rarely make explicit the underlying logic of these pressures. In doing
so, they conflate the various pathways by which the dilemma can
influence interstate dynamics. Here, I unpack the dilemma to reveal the
important variation in its forms. In doing so, I systematize and specify
the different forms in which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma may operate
and identify the conditions under which those forms are more or less
likely to arise.

I begin by discussing the use of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma in the
literature and briefly sketch the implicit model scholars often use to
describe and assess the dilemma. Next, I identify three embedded
assumptions in those models which, when relaxed, permit a more realistic
accounting of use-it-or-lose it pressures and how those pressures can
encourage a nuclear first strike. I then proceed to identify each of the
three mechanisms by which use-it-or-lose it pressures can operate,
discuss the conditions which are likely to make each mechanism more or
less salient, and provide illustrative examples. Finally, I close with a
discussion of the analysis and some concluding thoughts.

Use-It-Or-Lose-It Pressures in the Literature

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma is not the only domain in which nuclear
weapons can promote seemingly irrational behavior. [The world of nuclear
weapons is suffuse with paradox]{.underline}.1 It\'s a world in which,
according to the [logic of deterrence,]{.underline} the [hope of never
using]{.underline} a nuclear weapon [rests on the promise to use
one.]{.underline} As Brodie recognized, a nuclear capability should \"be
always ready to spring while going permanently unused. Surely there is
something almost unreal about all this.\"2 It\'s a world where the
enemy\'s attempts to shore up its defenses can be reassuring. Informed
that the Soviet Union had begun to harden its ICBM silos, U.S. Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara reportedly responded \"Thank God.\"3 And
it\'s a world where peace at one level can generate violence at another.
The stability-instability paradox predicts that while the deterrent
effects of strategic nuclear weapons may decrease the likelihood of
large-scale war between two nuclear-armed states, they may
simultaneously increase the likelihood of lower-scale conflicts.4
Schelling demonstrated the strategic advantages of the \"rationality of
irrationality.\"5

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma is ubiquitous in the literature on nuclear
weapons. The Cold War arms control agenda was often centered on-or, at
least, some theorists claim, should have centered on6-efforts to avoid
the creation of use-it-or-lose-it pressures for either superpower since
it was feared that such pressures could produce dangerous crisis
instability.7 At the end of the Cold War, Posen implicitly relied on the
concept to explain how a conventional conflict between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact could inadvertently escalate to the nuclear level.8 One
analyst has lobbied for the United States to adopt a no-first-use
nuclear policy, in part, to reduce the possibility of creating a
use-it-or-lose-it dilemma for an adversary.9 The use-it-or-lose-it
dilemma has been used to explain the dangerous escalation pressures that
could arise in a conflict between India and Pakistan.10 More recently,
scholars have used the dilemma to highlight the escalation risks
stemming from misperception and possible conventional-nuclear
entanglement in a conflict between China and the United States.11

However, despite their propensity for invoking the concept, scholars
rarely specify the mechanisms by which these pressures could induce a
nuclear first strike on the part of the pressured state. In fact, in its
simplest form, the first use of nuclear weapons under conditions of
mutual vulnerability, even in the face of use-it-or-lose-it pressures,
is still irrational.12 Typically presented as a stark choice between
either preemptively using all of its nuclear arsenal or having all of
that arsenal destroyed, this implicit model seems to permit no room for
the rational use of nuclear weapons.13 Framed in this way, the pressured
(and presumably inferior) state faces a choice between certain
annihilation in case it preemptively uses its weapons and certain
annihilation in the case it does not.14 Indeed, as one recent work
critiquing the logic of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has argued, \"We
may suppose that if a weaker adversary believes that it is about to be
hit first with nuclear weapons and wiped out, then it may take a chance
on striking first to try to inflict pain on the major power in order to
compel that major power to back down. But why would the major power back
down if the adversary has already expended its arsenal, making it more
vulnerable to a devastating riposte?\"15 [This critique embodies an
implicit model of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma which scholars have
repeatedly deployed, whether in applying the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma
or critiquing it. In it, a weaker state is in conflict or crisis with a
stronger adversary. Both are nuclear-armed. But the weaker state\'s
capabilities are so meager by comparison that, if the stronger adversary
so chose, it could execute a complete and sudden disarming first strike
against it.]{.underline}

Accepting the conditions embodied in this implicit model, it is still
possible for the pressured state to launch a nuclear first strike for
either irrational or arational reasons. First, state
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting the use-it-or-lose it
dilemma, [[even if facing certain annihilation, may draw emotional
utility from inflicting damage on the enemy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Facing
the shadows and ash of an impending nuclear strike, state [[leaders may
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} their bombs, [[not to]{.underline}]{.mark}
obtain any strategic or material [[gain, but only to
hurt]{.underline}]{.mark} the enemy.16 Emotions, including [[revenge,
can be powerful]{.underline}]{.mark} forces in the conduct of interstate
relations, especially [[when nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s are
involved]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scholars have argued that a state is most
likely to seek revenge when it believes the harm it suffers is morally
outrageous, when it feels humiliated, and when \"international
retaliation is institutionalized by rules and laws that govern the use
of cross-border force.\"17 What would be more morally outrageous, more
humiliating, and more counter to the decades of non-use and just war
principles of proportionality and discrimination than the prospect of a
nuclear strike?18 [[The underlying biological and emotional
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} driving the desire for revenge may have
evolved to serve an instrumental deterrent purpose. But, as McDermott,
Lopez, and Hatemi illustrate, those mechanisms also operate
independently: \"Revenge is not motivated by the rational expectation of
future deterrence. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[driven by
the]{.underline}]{.mark} intrinsic [[pleasure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[one expects to experience upon striking back]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"19
This mechanism is more likely to operate in state dyads featuring
long-standing enmity, oppositional ideologies, or strident nationalism.

Second, the expectation that a nuclear-armed state might confront
[[these]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of [[pressures can
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} it to adopt a more assertive nuclear
posture precisely to avoid or mitigate the dilemma. The leaders of a
weaker nuclear-armed state may believe that adopting
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} more assertive [[nuclear
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[decentralizes command]{.underline}]{.mark} and permits faster
launches, will increase the survivability of its nuclear forces. A more
assertive posture, characterized by peacetime targeting,
launch-on-warning, and [[pre-delegation, could increase the likelihood
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an accidental or [[unauthorized
launch]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Sagan illustrates, [nuclear weapons
programs are characterized by tight coupling]{.underline} (systems with
time-invariant processes) [and interactive complexity]{.underline} (many
interconnected and unplanned processes).20 These characteristics create
[systems which are prone to unplanned accidents.]{.underline} The U.S.
alone has experienced at least several dozen accidents involving nuclear
weapons.21 In the case of nuclear weapons, the risks inherent to any
interactively complex and tightly coupled system can be further
exacerbated by organizational pathologies in the military bureaucracies
entrusted with the weapons.22 This mechanism is more likely to operate
for states which are \"immature\" nuclear powers, meaning those which
are relatively recent entrants to the nuclear club and those which have
not yet developed comprehensive systems for securing and managing their
nuclear weapons.

Finally, state [[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} may launch a nuclear first
strike for strictly \"irrational\" reasons. Irrational, of course does
not mean impossible. Indeed, individuals [[confronted with time
constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}, induced [[stress, and uncertainty are
more]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to resort to decision-making styles
[[vulnerable to cognitive errors]{.underline}]{.mark}.23
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} are the very
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[abound in]{.underline}]{.mark}
interstate [[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} and conflicts. According to one
recent review of the neurobiological and behavioral studies literature,
\"when stressed, individuals tend to make more habitual responses than
goal-directed choices, be less likely to adjust their initial judgment,
and rely more on gut feelings in social situations.\"24 Studies have
shown that the presence of acute stressors induce individuals to resort
to cognitive heuristics of the kind representative of intuitive
decision-makers.25 This is a recipe for irrationality. Indeed, a recent
accounting of U.S. wargames during the Cold War found that, in every
instance in which a team used nuclear weapons, the constraints of the
crisis environment played a role.26 According to one wargame participant
at the time, \"If the US team had had more time to talk, it probably
would have decided not to use nuclear weapons after all.\"27 This
mechanism is more likely to operate for immature nuclear powers and for
states led by leaders featuring low levels of cognitive complexity. When
it comes to nuclear weapons, experience matters. At the level of the
state, Horowitz finds the likelihood of a nuclear-armed state to either
reciprocate a militarized challenge or have its own militarized
challenge reciprocated decreases over time.28 At the level of the
individual, research has demonstrated that deep relevant experience in a
given area can reduce cognitive errors in decision-making related to
that area.29 States with less experience with nuclear weapons and crises
involving them may be more likely to act in seemingly irrational ways.
Similarly, and apart from variations stemming from experience, the
state\'s susceptibility to irrational behavior may also vary with
cognitive characteristics of the leader, as Rathbun demonstrates how
variation in the cognitive styles of state leaders (whether highly
intuitive or highly rational) can drive variation in state behavior.30

Having identified three irrational or arational reasons a state
confronting the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma might choose to launch its
nuclear weapons, I now move to a discussion of the rational strategic
mechanisms by which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma can induce a nuclear
first strike on the part of the pressured state.

Implicit Models and Embedded Assumptions

Scholars have often employed implicit models like that outlined above to
understand the concept of use-it-or-lose-it pressures and the limits of
those pressures in (rationally) affecting state behavior. These implicit
models contain three embedded assumptions which, together, make first
use of nuclear weapons under conditions of mutual vulnerability appear
irrational, regardless of the presence of use-it-or-lose-it pressures.

First, the implicit models assume complete and symmetric certainty on
the part of both the pressured state and its adversary that a disarming
first strike would succeed. The implicit model generally makes no room
for uncertainty, either on the part of the weaker state or the strong
one. However, the history of nuclear exchange modeling in the United
States shows that state predictions about the outcomes of a nuclear
strike were often fraught with uncertainty. Throughout the Cold War,
various U.S. agencies attempted to quantify the number of fatalities
that might result in a nuclear exchange with the United States.31 These
assessments exhibited significant uncertainty within assessment and
variation across them. For example, one such assessment of the nuclear
balance in 1962 conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense predicted
that the United States would suffer anywhere from 4 to 85 million
fatalities, while the Soviet Union would suffer anywhere between 10 and
95 million, despite the U.S. enjoying an advantage in total warheads of
25,000.32

Second, is the assumption that this complete destruction or disabling of
the pressured state\'s nuclear arsenal will happen nearly
instantaneously. If the pressured state faces the prospect of complete
and (near) instantaneous disarmament, then it faces a stark choice in
whether and how to use its nuclear arsenal. [Any forces which are not
used prior to the disarming strike will no longer be
usable]{.underline}. However, even if an adversary is able, eventually,
to complete a disarming first strike, [it may not be able to accomplish
it quickly enough to prevent a counterstrike, however limited that
retaliatory attack may be]{.underline}. The longer the window between
the destruction of the first nuclear asset and the last, the greater
opportunity for the pressured state to maneuver strategically in
response. The adversary may be able to destroy all of the pressured
state\'s nuclear forces, but the time it takes to do so will likely grow
with the size, sophistication, and diversity of the pressured state\'s
nuclear forces.

The technical and military requirements necessary to successfully
conduct a (nearly) simultaneous disarming strike are likely often
tremendous and these requirements increase with the size,
sophistication, and diversity of the opponent\'s nuclear forces. Forces
must, in military vocabulary, [\"find, fix, track, target, engage, and
assess\" the nuclear systems of the adversary.]{.underline}33 This can
be complicated when those adversary systems are concealed, mobile,
dispersed, and on varied platforms. [The underlying question is not
whether the state can successfully eliminate the adversary\'s nuclear
forces, but whether it can do so quickly enough without giving the
adversary time to respond.]{.underline}

Third, implicit [[models]{.mark} of use it or lose dynamics
[assume]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} pressured [state is confronted with
a]{.mark} sharp [choice between]{.mark} either [using all]{.mark} of
[its]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal or none]{.mark} of it]{.underline}. This
third assumption proceeds logically from the first. If the pressured
state faces certain and simultaneous impending disarmament, then there
is no reason to save some of its capabilities. Any weapons which are not
used now will necessarily be wiped out by the opponent and so, the
logic, goes if one is to use any of the arsenal, one might as well use
all of it. However, by relaxing these three assumptions, we permit the
pressured state [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} wider (and [[more realistic)
range of options]{.underline}]{.mark} in using its nuclear forces.
Specifically, [[the pressured state may opt to]{.underline}]{.mark}
launch a [[strike using only part of its arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark},
while reserving the rest of it for follow-on strikes or deterrent
signals.

Relaxing each of these three assumptions permits us to build models
which are both more realistic and which allow (unfortunately) for a
broader range of uses of nuclear weapons, including rational ones. If
the adversary is unable to execute a certain and simultaneous disarming
first strike, [[use-it-or-lose-it pressures are no longer concentrated
on a single point in time]{.underline}]{.mark} but, rather, operate
across a period of time. [[This lengthening of the time
frame]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[transforms]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[interactions]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two states from one best
modeled as a one-shot shot game to one modeled as a repeated game. [[In
the repeated game]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the time is compressed,
[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} still opportunity for interaction
between the two states, creating [[space for the rational use of
nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Below I review three strategic mechanisms by which use-it-or-lose-it
pressures can produce first-use of nuclear weapons: intra-conflict
signaling, asymmetric offset, and postconflict posturing, are all
strategic mechanisms. The operation of each of the strategic mechanisms
may be sensitive to both the embedded assumptions discussed above and
other features of the interstate conflict. For each mechanism, I provide
brief sketch of its underlying logic, a discussion of the conditions
under which the mechanism is more or less likely to operate, and a
real-world illustration of how the mechanism might work in practice.
Table 1 summarizes the six mechanisms, identifies their rational basis,
describes the underlying logic, and highlights conditions which
facilitate their operation. I make no claims as to the frequency or
likelihood with which each mechanism actually operates. These pressures
may still be rare and, even when present, need not mechanistically
produce a nuclear first strike. However, by adopting more realistic
assumptions about the conditions under which these pressures may
operate, we are able to see how states may still rationally perceive
some utility in launching a nuclear first strike.

Mechanism 1: Intra-Conflict Signaling

[[A state]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting use-it-or-lose-it pressures
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} feel compelled to launch a
[[strike]{.underline}]{.mark} if it believes the window need for the
disarming first strike to unfold is sufficiently large to permit the use
of its nuclear arsenal [[for intra-conflict
signaling]{.underline}]{.mark}. The signaling function of a nuclear
strike works largely because of the ability of the pressured state to
threaten similar future nuclear strikes if the adversary does not cease
its attacks. This mechanism is very sensitive to the length of time it
takes to execute the disarming first strike. If an adversary\'s
disarming first strike truly could be accomplished (nearly)
instantaneously, then there is no hope of retaining some of the force
for follow-on strikes, eliminating the possibility of intra-conflict
deterrent signaling. However, as the time frame for accomplishing the
strike expands, so does the potential for the pressured state to use its
remaining force to conduct intra-conflict deterrence signaling.

The intra-conflict signaling mechanism is more likely to operate when
there is greater uncertainty about the ability of the nuclear superior
state to execute a disarming first strike and when the expected time
needed to complete that strike is longer. This mechanism approximates
the strategy of limited retaliation described by Robert Powell.34 Here,
the pressured state faces the possibility that its nuclear forces will
be eliminated within a given window of time. However, if the window is
sufficiently large, the pressured state may attempt to launch a limited
nuclear strike against the adversary while still retaining some of its
capabilities. In this way, the strike is valuable not because of the
immediate damage it causes to the adversary, but rather because of the
implied future damage to the adversary. So long as the adversary may
have some uncertainty in its ability to completely and immediately
disarm the pressured state of its remaining nuclear capabilities, the
adversary may be deterred.

During the Cold War, war planners recognized the fact that nuclear
strikes themselves might be carried out over periods of hours to even
months, depending on the contours of the conflict. Some envisioned the
United States waging a \"protracted nuclear war,\" in which the conflict
would consist of a series of nuclear exchanges spread across up to six
months, with each side working to quickly reconstitute additional
nuclear forces.35 But even discussions of how the United States would
employ its nuclear arsenal in larger-scale initial \"spasm\" strikes
accounted for a \"transattack period,\" defined as "\[i\]n nuclear
warfare, the period from the initiation of the attack to its
termination.\"36 Planning for this period implies a recognition that
even large-scale initial strikes might not be executed instantaneously.
References to the imagined length of this transattack period are largely
excised from public sources.37 But one government source stated that
\"This period would normally be the first 12 to 14 hours after
attack.\"38 Though this window is certainly compressed by the standards
of large-scale conventional war, it also permits some maneuverability
within the conflict.

Mechanism 2: Asymmetric Offset

[[Use-it-or-lose-it pressures may cause states to]{.mark} launch a
nuclear first]{.underline} [[strike]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt
[[to asymmetrically offset]{.mark} the superior [conventional
capabilities]{.mark} of an adversary.]{.underline} In this way, a state
may view its nuclear weapons as crucial tools for deterring or defeating
a conventional attack.39 If the pressured state believes that the
adversary is likely to launch a large-scale attack and that its own
conventional forces are insufficient to either deter or defeat the
adversary, it may view its nuclear forces as a necessary means of
reducing the likelihood of suffering a devastating conventional attack.
The very perception that its nuclear capabilities are under threat could
even increase the perceived likelihood that the pressured state
confronts an impending large-scale conventional strike by the
adversary.40

Crucially, and unlike the intra-conflict signaling mechanism, the
asymmetric offset mechanism can operate regardless of whether, as
discussed above, the use-it-or-lose-it pressures are concentrated at a
point in time or are spread across a longer time frame. If those
pressures are spread across a longer time frame, the pressured state may
have more opportunities to use its nuclear arsenal in order to shift the
military balance in its favor. But even if those pressures converge on a
single point in time, [[the]{.mark} pressured [state may find it
rational]{.mark} to use its weapons [if]{.mark} it believes both that
conflict is imminent (or ongoing) and that [using its nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} can meaningfully [change the conventional balance.
]{.mark}]{.underline}The pressured state may still find it fruitful to
signal its resolve in the impending post-strike conventional conflict,
even if the underlying signal does not materially change the military
balance.41

The signal is also probably more likely to operate when the conventional
military balance between the states is both sufficiently large that the
conventionally inferior state sees an advantage in resorting to nuclear
weapons and sufficiently small that the nuclear offset could make a
meaningful difference.42 That is, in crises or conflicts featuring
overly large conventional military imbalances, no amount of nuclear
offset may be enough while in crises or conflicts featuring relative
parity, nuclear offset may be viewed as unnecessary.

This mechanism can operate at the level of the unified state, but it is
likely to be more pronounced for states which have developed an
asymmetric escalation nuclear posture.43 This posture is characterized
by the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons and the pre-delegation
of use authority for those battlefield weapons to lower-level military
commanders. Under these conditions, [[lower-level]{.underline}]{.mark}
military [[commanders]{.mark}]{.underline} may believe that the very
survival of their units and themselves is dependent on defeating a local
conventionally superior adversary force which could only be accomplished
by resorting to their own battlefield nuclear weapons. In these
instances, commanders [[may opt to launch a nuclear first-strike to save
themselves, even if it risks escalating the broader
conflict]{.underline}.]{.mark}

For example, a conflict between North Korea and the United States could
generate some of these pressures for the leadership in Pyongyang. As
Narang summarizes, \"If North Korea and the United States wind up
shooting at each other, it might make sense for Kim to use nuclear
weapons first in a way that increases his chances of survival. The basic
idea is to use one set of nuclear devices to stave off the conventional
invasion, and hold in reserve longer range, more powerful devices that
threaten the enemy\'s cities to deter nuclear annihilation.\"44 In this
way, despite the likelihood that the United States might be able to
eliminate North Korea\'s nuclear arsenal, Pyongyang may still attempt a
strike to weaken U.S. conventional forces in the region beforehand.

Mechanism 3: Post-Conflict Posturing

Finally, use-it-or-lose it pressures can lead to nuclear first use under
conditions of mutual vulnerability if the pressured state believes there
is a sufficiently high risk of all-out war, including the likelihood of
it suffering a nuclear strike itself. In this case, the pressured state
may believe that a large-scale conflict and its attendant destruction is
likely. Rather than concentrating solely on the immediate outcome of
this impending conflict, [[the pressured state may]{.mark} also [be
concerned about]{.mark} how quickly it could recover from the conflict
and, in particular, [whether it could recover faster than the
adversary.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This mechanism is more likely to operate when the pressured state
believes that the coming conflict is likely to represent total war. The
greater the expected scope and destructiveness of the conflict, the more
the pressured state may look to its long-term strategic implications.
This mechanism is also more likely to operate the greater the perceived
degree of parity between the overall power of two states. The greater
the power parity between the two states, the greater the parity in
expected recovery times and, therefore, the more sensitive those
relative recovery times will be to the immediate effects of a nuclear
exchange. However, in highly asymmetric crises or conflicts in which one
state enjoys a preponderance of power, it may be impossible for the
weaker state to meaningfully affect the relative recovery time of the
stronger state given the tremendous gap in starting points between the
two. If the gap in overall power between the two states is sufficiently
large and the nuclear capabilities of the stronger state are
sufficiently powerful, it may even be possible for the stronger state to
completely eliminate the weaker state a political entity, making moot
the issue of recovery time.

During the Cold War, U.S. decision-makers explicitly weighed relative
recovery time as an outcome measure in nuclear exchange planning and
modeling. In 1974, President Richard Nixon issued National Security
Decision Memorandum-242, \"Planning Nuclear Weapons Employment for
Deterrence,\" which outlined a framework for the employment of U.S.
nuclear weapons. That framework was concerned not only with the
immediate capabilities offered by the nuclear arsenal in a general war
with the Soviet Union. It also explicitly looked to the post-war era in
mandating that U.S. forces be able to create the \"\[djestruction of the
political, economic, and military resources critical to the enemy\'s
postwar power, influence, and ability to recover at an early time as a
major power.\"45 Similarly, in his 1977 report to Congress, Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld explained that \"We believe that a substantial
number of military forces and critical industries in the Soviet Union
should be directly targeted, and that an important objective of the
assured retaliation mission should be to retard significantly the
ability of the USSR to recover from a nuclear exchange and regain the
status of a 20th-century military and industrial power more rapidly than
the United States."46 The aim of U.S. nuclear strategy was not to
\"win\" the immediate war (though it did aim at that) but, more
significantly, to win the inevitable race to recovery which came
after.47

[[In]{.mark} the event of [a]{.mark} major [crisis]{.mark} or conflict
today [between]{.mark} seemingly more equally powerful states such as
between the United States and China or [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Russia, these pressures would be more likely to
exist]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the post-conflict posturing
mechanism is unlikely to operate between states with drastic disparities
in overall power for at least two reasons. First, the gap in overall
power between the two states is likely to be so large that it could be
offset only by a similarly large and opposite nuclear balance. Second,
the nuclear balance is likely correlated with the overall power balance,
meaning that the weaker state is unlikely to possess anywhere near the
massive nuclear forces necessary to offset its inferiority. For example,
the United States today enjoys such a tremendous relative power
advantage over North Korea that, in the event of a large-scale conflict
between the two, it is inconceivable that North Korea could ever hope to
enjoy a recovery time faster than the United States.

However, even [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} an all-out [[nuclear war between
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite horrific casualties, neither
country\'s population is likely to be completely destroyed by the direct
effects of the blast, fire, and radiation.8 The aftermath could be much
worse: the burning of flammable materials could send massive amounts of
[[smoke]{.underline}]{.mark} into the atmosphere, which [[would]{.mark}
absorb sunlight and [cause]{.mark} sustained [global cooling]{.mark},
severe ozone loss, and ag]{.underline}ricultural [disruption - a nuclear
winter.]{.underline}

According to one model 9, an all-out exchange of 4,000 weapons10 could
lead to a drop in global temperatures of around 8°C, [[making it
impossible to grow food]{.mark}]{.underline} for 4 to 5 years. This
could leave some survivors in parts of Australia and New Zealand, but
they would be in a very precarious situation and the threat of
extinction from other sources would be great. An [exchange on [this
scale is only possible between the US and Russia who have more than 90%
of the world\'s nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear
weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even [a]{.underline} small **[regional nuclear
war]{.underline}** involving 100 nuclear weapons would produce a nuclear
winter serious enough to put two billion people at risk of starvation,12
though this estimate might be pessimistic.13 Wars on this scale [are
**unlikely to lead to outright human extinction**]{.underline}**,** but
this does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
existential risk from nuclear war over the next century, and existing
attempts leave very large confidence intervals. According to many
experts, the most likely nuclear war at present is between India and
Pakistan.14 However, given the relatively modest size of their arsenals,
[**[the risk of]{.mark}** human [**extinction** is]{.mark}]{.underline}
plausibly [[greater from a **conflict between the
U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[and

[increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the

declared that Donald Trump is \'serious\' about annexing
Greenland.]{.underline}

In an ominous warning Putin declared that [[Russia is \'watching very

\'We are talking about serious plans on the American side with regard to
Greenland. These plans have long-standing historical roots,\' Putin told
the International Arctic Forum in the Russian city of Murmansk.

is by the situation.]{.underline}

Putin said [[Russia]{.mark} has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,
but [is prepared to defend its interests]{.mark}, [and will station more
military personnel in the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Greenland is a strategically important island in the North Atlantic as a
buffer between North America and Russia.

Putin\'s comments were his first public intervention on the issue.

It comes as Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha are on Friday set
to visit Pituffik Space Base on the northern edge of Greenland. Trump\'s
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is scheduled to go with them.

In his remarks Putin noted that taking over Greenland is \'not eccentric
talk\' from the Trump administration.

He also pointed out the United States has long had an interest in
Greenland, going back to the 19th Century.

[\'It would be a great mistake to believe these are some kind of
extravagant conversations of the new American
administration]{.underline},\' he said.

\'Nothing of the kind. In fact the United States of America had such
plans back in the 1860s,\' he said.

island.

[[The full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in February
2022 [[did not alter Russia's Arctic military posture]{.mark}. [If
anything]{.mark}, [Moscow's]{.mark} obsessive [search for complete
control]{.mark} over the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF)
[has been vindicated]{.mark} by wider geopolitical
developments.]{.underline} Nevertheless, Finland's and Sweden's
accession to NATO is making Russia feel more vulnerable from a military
point of view.

This [[self-perception of vulnerability will inform]{.underline}]{.mark}
how Russia projects itself in the region, especially through [low
intensity [war]{.mark}fare operations [against NATO]{.mark} and its
allies -- [which]{.mark} in turn [raises]{.mark} the [risk of
miscalc]{.mark}ulation [and escalation]{.mark} in a changing
Arctic.]{.underline}

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

From Moscow's viewpoint, the perceived 'enlargement' of NATO to Finland
and Sweden is fueling both a sense of vindication and vulnerability
across the AZRF -- geographically extending from the North Atlantic and
the European High North, to North Pole approaches in the Central Arctic,
to the North Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement' 1) by
the Atlantic Alliance has been validated by Finland and Sweden joining
NATO. [The double accession represents a fait accompli for the Kremlin,
honed by a self-reinforcing propagandistic narrative that the Alliance
is turning the Arctic into a 'conflict zone']{.underline} 2) or that
there is a 'new Cold War' 3) in the region because of Western policy.

[This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in 2022 and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force' 4) or 'inviting confrontation' 5) in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further fuels the Russian logic
that the non-Russian Arctic has become 'NATO territory'. This ends up
creating a 'NATO 7 vs. Russia'6) approach, which tends to securitize
Arctic affairs and shape discussions increasingly in military terms. The
policy consequences are that Moscow is planning more than ever for all
contingencies, including open military confrontation in the Arctic.

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, the impact of the war has led
Moscow to feel vulnerable in the Arctic. This vulnerability is strategic
(with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and military, especially with
regards to the impact of climate change and receding sea ice across the
AZRF.

[The [Russia]{.mark}n leadership [fears that a more accessible
Arctic]{.mark} will [bring]{.mark} along [more military activity from
NATO]{.mark} and its allies]{.underline} in the European Arctic and
above North Pole approaches. It also fears there will be more military
presence from the US and Canada in the Pacific Arctic -- alongside
Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and presence.

The [July 2024 Ukrainian drone strike]{.underline} 7) [on the Olenya air
base in the northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic bombers are
stationed, also reinforces their sense of vulnerability -- not least by
defying the genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air defense
capabilities.]{.underline}

Ultimately, Moscow does not want to be dispossessed of its control over
the AZRF. [[The fact that NATO's direct borders with Russia have
increased]{.mark} in size in the Arctic and Baltic theaters will
undoubtedly [push the Kremlin to adapt its force
projection]{.mark}.]{.underline}

And no, we're not making that up.

The good news is, as far as we know, they haven't yet been able to

But knowing the ridiculousness of Russian propaganda, those [claims
might not be far]{.underline}

[behind.]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has been very busy in this part of the

[infrastructure [here than]{.mark} it's invested in [any other part of

[a frantic pace designed to position it to quickly occupy the area and
extract the wealth]{.underline}

[of newly discovered resources and newly unlocked shipping lanes before
its competitors can.]{.underline}

These [[improvements]{.mark} have [include]{.mark}d]{.underline} buffing
up its [ice-breaking fleet]{.underline}, already the largest

in the world, to include more than 40 vessels costing more than a
quarter billion dollars

each, along with investing [in a [new]{.mark} Arctic [oil

its kind [[floating nuclear power plant\[s\]]{.mark} fleet]{.underline},
[with nuclear reactor]{.underline} ships designed to move

as needed and provide reliable power to remote Arctic cities of up to
100,000 people.

To tie it all together, [they're even building a [\$110 billion dollar
Arctic megaport]{.mark}]{.underline}, something

that requires them to build entire new infrastructure just to reach the
site - along with an 870

kilometer pipeline to transport oil to the region, plus new highways, 2
new [[airports]{.underline}]{.mark},

15 brand new villages, and several electric plants - everything that's
needed to house

an estimated 400,000 workers to service the operation.

And while [all of this infrastructure provides obvious advantages
[for]{.mark} [mineral, oil, and gas]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[extraction]{.mark}, it also provides something that is arguably even
more valuable in the long]{.underline}

[term - the [ability to control]{.mark} the bulk of the shipping and
[trade]{.mark} that passes through]{.underline}

[the Arctic Ocean.]{.underline}

You see, the Arctic Ocean itself is changing very quickly, and
drastically.

In 40 years, it has lost 40% of its sea ice during its seasonal minimum,
and the oldest

parts of the Arctic ice sheets have declined by a stunning 95% in the
same time period,

with some estimates claiming that the Arctic could be entirely ice free
during the summer

months by as early as 2040.

And [as this ice melts, it's opening massive ocean shipping routes that
humanity has never]{.underline}

[had access to before - trade routes that were once considered
impassable, but that after]{.underline}

[opening up will be shorter and come with many other advantages over
current alternatives]{.underline}

[- especially when it comes to trade between Russia and their main trade
partners, India]{.underline}

[and China, and also when it comes to trade between Europe and
Asia.]{.underline}

The [Arctic trade route is up to 40% shorter than current
alternatives,]{.underline} cutting up to 9000

km off a one way trip.

But the shipping here isn't just faster, it's also far more resilient.

In current major trade routes, like the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal,
small errors can

lead to major halts in global shipping, such as when the Ever Given
became stuck in the

Suez and halted global trade for weeks.

But with the breadth and depth of the Arctic, such incidents are
impossible.

And the depth of the polar trade route also gives it other advantages
over shallow canals,

such as allowing ships to carry heavier loads that put them deeper in
the water.

As one example, one of the heaviest trade ships in history recently
passed through the

Arctic during the brief ice-free summer season, saving them tens of
thousands of dollars on

fuel costs by allowing them to carry larger loads and reduce their total
trips.

[Combine less needed trips with much shorter shipping routes, and you
begin to realize]{.underline}

[some serious competitive potential.]{.underline}

Currently, around 20,000 ships annually pass through the Suez Canal,
generating close to

\$10 billion in annual revenue for Egypt, while only around 1,700 ships
enter the Arctic each

year.

But those numbers are changing before our eyes, and will change
drastically in our lifetimes.

In 2017, a Russian oil tanker crossed the Arctic without needing an ice
breaker for

the first time - a monumental change that resulted in an immediate
uptick in trade.

The following year, traffic in the Arctic increased by 80% to 16 million
metric tons.

And in 2019, that number increased again to 23 million metric tons.

The trends continued, even during extreme sanctions against Russia
during the War in

Ukraine, and between 2014 and 2022, trade in the Arctic increased by a
massive 755%

\- something which is expected to increase by another tenfold between
now and 2035.

Wars and melting ice aside, new international trade routes are healthy,
and overall a net

gain in the long term for the global economy and international
cooperation as a whole.

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} on the flip side, [a small taste of this
growing power has caused Russia to push things...more]{.underline}

[than a little bit too far.]{.underline}

And [to ensure it can claim as much of this power as possible, Russia's
growth in the]{.underline}

[region has not by any means been limited to civilian
infrastructure.]{.underline}

[In fact, [most]{.mark} of their [moves]{.mark} here [have been
military]{.mark} ones.]{.underline}

[To protect what it sees as one of its primary strategic regions, Russia
has recently established]{.underline}

[a Northern Command, formed new Arctic brigades, and equipped Arctic
bases with new rockets]{.underline}

for coastal defense alongside specialized anti-aircraft systems designed
to perform

in the extreme Arctic cold.

[Russia has also made moves to re-ignite Cold War era hostilities in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [renovating]{.underline}

[a huge number of formerly abandoned Soviet military bases in the area,
and even building]{.underline}

[5 new ones, bringing it to a total of 52 bases in the
region.]{.underline}

This means [that Russia now outnumbers NATO in the Arctic]{.underline},
by about a third.

And unlike most global arenas, [[due to NATO's]{.mark} relative [neglect
of the region]{.mark}, and NATO's]{.underline}

[comparative paucity of winter-trained troops and winter-ready
equipment, plus the fact]{.underline}

[that many Russians have been born and raised in these extreme cold
conditions, the Arctic]{.underline}

[may be the only global arena where Russia potentially has a true
strategic advantage.]{.underline}

And while this buildup is accelerating quickly, it's hardly something
that has happened

overnight.

The major build-up has been ongoing for more than 17 years, the length
of time since Russia's

famous, but now largely forgotten mission in 2007 to plant its titanium
flag on the

seabed of the North Pole, making a very clear statement about their
intentions, that was

largely ignored by the western world.

And Russia's efforts here have especially ramped up since 2014, a year
that should sound

familiar - since it was the year that Russia annexed Crimea from
Ukraine - something that

may be far more connected to Russia's Arctic ambitions than most people
realize, which

we'll explain shortly.

In a somewhat recent public statement about Russia's presence here,
which is a little

bit outdated, and likely understates the current situation, it was noted
[that Russia currently]{.underline}

[has at least 45,000 troops stationed in the Arctic]{.underline}, quite
a large standing army considering

the remote nature of the region, [alongside 3,400 military vehicles, 41
ships, 15 submarines,]{.underline}

[including 8 of Russia's 11 nuclear subs, and 110 aircraft, which Russia
has been using]{.underline}

[to make the most long-range bomber patrols in history since the end of
the Cold War - regularly]{.underline}

[sending nuclear-capable bombers to Alaska, and especially, along
Canada's Arctic coast,]{.underline}

[as a warning to the U.S. and Canada not to interfere with Russian
claims to the region.]{.underline}

The question is, [why does [Russia]{.mark} feel the need to get so
[aggressive]{.mark} in the Arctic, especially]{.underline}

[considering that nobody else has been doing that,]{.underline} and what
might it all mean for the future?

The answer, as is normally the case with aggression of this type, is
that they are trying to make

claims to the region that extend beyond what they are actually
rightfully entitled to,

and are trying to add pressure to those claims with military presence to
help them achieve

their goals.

Russia, Canada, and Denmark have all laid claim to overlapping pieces of
the Arctic

Ocean, including the North Pole, and [Russia wants to show the world
that, unlike its competitors,]{.underline}

[it's [ready to fight to defend its stake]{.mark}, and the potentially
trillions of dollars of]{.underline}

[natural resources it unlocks.]{.underline}

The way it works is that each nation is allowed to claim the waters of
up to 200 miles off

its coast as its own territory for rights such as fishing, transport, or
mining.

After that, waters are open for grabs if you can prove they belong to
you - which has a

lot to do with proving the extent of your nation's continental shelf,
something that

is supposed to be a scientific process, not a political one.

The problem is that defining who owns the continental shelf is quite
tricky in the Arctic,

and so the scientific process becomes more murky than we would like,
with just enough

gray area for cunning politicians seeking power and profit to turn it
from a process

of scientific observation into a political battle of wills.

Russia first made a claim to expand its Arctic shelf in 2001, but its
claim was rejected

by the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf due to a
lack of scientific

evidence.

Not to be deterred, Russia then waited, and filed its claim again when
the time was geopolitically

right - in 2015, right after the dust had just settled from its
annexation of Crimea,

a region that, like the Arctic, had also been desired by Russia due in
part to its wealth

in energy resources, and its strategic position on the global map.

The timing should not be ignored.

[In [Crimea]{.mark}, Russia had [prove]{.mark}n that it was
[will]{.mark}ing [to defend]{.mark} its competing [territorial
claims]{.mark}]{.underline}

[with other nations [by]{.mark} using military [force]{.mark}, and other
nations had proven that they were]{.underline}

[willing to roll over on their backs and look the other way to appease
Russia.]{.underline}

As was the case with Germany leading up to World War II, Russia had
learned that it could

violate international law and claim the territories that rightfully
belonged to other nations

as their own, and that no one would hold them accountable with any
meaningful consequences.

And so, when Russia then made their new claims over the Arctic in 2015,
and once again in

2021, they were much bolder than the original - to the point of seeming
to be intentionally

provocative and offensive - [with Russia [claiming]{.mark} almost [70
percent of]{.mark} the entire [Arctic Ocean]{.mark},]{.underline}

which it had previously said should be renamed the Russian Ocean, while
also directly and

deliberately competing with claims that had previously been filed by
Denmark and Canada,

even going so far as to extend their claim all the way up to, and by
some interpretations,

including, Greenland and Canada's 200 mile coastal limits.

This was an action that would effectively box these nations in and
prevent them from

having any meaningful access to the most mineral rich parts of the
Arctic region, and it was,

ironically, the type of progressive border advancement that Russia
claims it is upset

at NATO for constantly doing, but which in truth Russia itself has been
far more guilty

of in recent history.

When considered in light of the very public troop build ups that
preceded it, this was

a move that may have amounted to Russia simply bullying their neighbors,
saying "If you

won't grant us our scientific claim, we might simply be willing to take
everything

in the Arctic, by force."

Russia would gamble that, since these nations had never had access to
these Arctic territories

before, they wouldn't care enough about them to risk war, and would
simply let Russia

have them if Russia pushed.

Which was...probably a good gamble.

As it happened, the populations of the impacted nations showed that they
really couldn't

care less about Russia in the Arctic, at least as a whole.

The entire thing seemed to amount to a few late night comedy skits about
Russians riding

reindeer into battle, or a few inadequate actions in dusty corners of
forgotten government

offices, and then sort of seemed to sizzle out of the public
consciousness - exactly

the way that Russia likes things.

And if people didn't care about Russia encroaching on their own
territorial claims, they weren't

at all likely to care about Russia encroaching on the territorial claims
of others.

So a year after their most recent Arctic claim, Russia seemed satisfied
by the apathy of the

west about its ambitions, and then proceeded with their full scale
invasion of Ukraine.

The lack of response to the situation in the Arctic certainly wasn't the
only reason

they felt emboldened to invade, but it certainly didn't help either.

When it comes to geopolitics, savvy world leaders are always testing and
measuring international

responses, starting small, and then progressively building up until they
hit their limit.

And if you're weak in one arena, the assumption is that you're probably
going to be weak

in all arenas.

An assumption that, for Russia, has proven to be quite true in NATO's
response to its

invasion, a response which hasn't been nonexistent, but has certainly
been inadequate.

And so, the geopolitics of the Arctic have become something reminiscent
of the geopolitics

of the South China Sea - with the same exact types of political
tensions, and identical

types of provocations over disputed waters.

[[Competing]{.mark} territorial [claims]{.mark} over shipping rights
lead to aerial patrols and the testing]{.underline}

[of international willpower]{.underline}, and then, [eventually, [lead
to]{.mark} [threats of full-scale invasions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Russia especially cares about the Arctic these days
because]{.underline}, with the accession of Finland,

and probably Sweden into NATO[, it has essentially lost its ability to
project power in the Baltic]{.underline}

[Sea, making the Arctic its only remaining defensible access point into
international]{.underline}

[waters.]{.underline}

But I've already discussed that at length in a previous video about the
current politics

surrounding the Baltic and Kaliningrad, so I won't belabor the point
here, other than

to say that, [[the more]{.mark} power that [Russia loses]{.mark} as a

[\[Inserted "Russia" in last paragraph for clarity\]]{.underline}

Instead, the main drivers of the [[Arctic resource
rush]{.underline}]{.mark} are minerals, in particular [[r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark}]{.underline} such as [neodymium,
praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium]{.underline}. These minerals are
key to the world's electric-vehicle and renewable-energy revolutions,
underpinning battery technology and wind turbines among other things.
However, it's worth noting that [lead, [iron,]{.mark} nickel, zinc,
[gold]{.mark}, [silver, coal]{.mark}, mica, precious stones [and
construction minerals]{.mark} such as sand, gravel and crushed rock are
also believed to be present in significant quantities.]{.underline}

The [[estimated value of]{.mark} minerals in Arctic Russia stands at
[\$]{.mark}US1.5--[2 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Geological
Survey of Norway concluded that the subsurface of the Kola Peninsula
contains a ['remarkable' abundance of various minerals.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the Canadian Shield, which extends through eastern and
central Canada from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, features
high-grade metamorphic rocks that hold large reserves of copper, gold,
lead, molybdenum and uranium. In Greenland, melting ice is exposing
mineral belts that are highly likely to contain gold, nickel,
platinum-group elements, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds and
rare earth elements.

[[Most]{.mark} of the known resources [are]{.mark} located [within the
boundaries of]{.mark} Arctic [nation states]{.mark}, making their
ownership and rights to any exploitation politically uncontroversial and
beyond challenge.]{.underline} 'The land masses are pretty much clearly
defined among the Arctic Eight and their exclusive economic zones,' says
Boulègue. 'On land and within their continental shelves, there is no
scramble for resources.'

Arctic wildlife

In January this year, the Biden administration revoked an executive
order instigated by Donald Trump in 2017 that attempted to open up US
Arctic waters to new drilling activities. 'Oil and gas drilling
contributes to climate change and threatens wildlife and communities.
The court's decision to uphold the ban on oil and gas leasing in the
Arctic Ocean gets us one step closer to permanent protection. We need to
drill less, not more,' says Margaret Williams, managing director of the
WWF-US Arctic programme. The vast size, remote location and extreme
weather conditions -- combined with the complete lack of infrastructure
for responding to oil spills -- make drilling in the Arctic Ocean
extremely dangerous. WWF-US describes the international capability to
respond to emergencies and oil spills as severely limited. 'Broken ice
and other severe weather conditions in the Arctic would make any large
oil spill or well blowout catastrophic for the amazing life in the
area,' Williams adds.

Spills aren't just a theoretical threat. In 2020, a storage tank near
Norilsk in Russia sank, probably as a result of melting permafrost, and
17,500 tonnes of oil leaked into rivers, a previously pristine lake and
the Arctic Ocean.

Expansion of oil and gas drilling could also be extremely damaging for
polar bears. Not only would direct contact with spilled oil kill them,
but an invisible threat could persist for years, as toxic substances
lingering in ice or seawater may have an impact on the entire Arctic
ecosystem. The use of underwater seismic testing could also affect
communication between beluga whales, other cetaceans and pinnipeds.

[[Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} the melting [[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the remaining space are [intensely [intertwined with
geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back in 2007,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} dispatched a submarine to plant a titanium
flag on the seabed four kilometres beneath the North Pole, [symbolically
staking a [claim]{.mark} to more than a [million square
kilometres]{.mark} of seabed around the pole and the [billions of
dollars of oil and gas reserves]{.mark} thought to lie
therein.]{.underline} Although the act was interpreted as Russia
thumbing its nose at the rest of the world, it's clear that [Moscow
meant business.]{.underline}

'[[Culturally]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [historically,]{.mark} the Arctic is
hugely [important to Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}' says Kennedy-Pipe.
['[But]{.mark}]{.underline} [it's [also]{.mark} important
[militarily]{.mark} and for security as it provides access to the
Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}. Now it also offers an opportunity to
harvest [[oil and gas]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Russia sees an ice-free
northern sea route as key for transporting coal to India and China, but
it also looks at a map and sees that [it's a short distance for a
nuc]{.mark}lear missile [to travel]{.mark} from North America over the
Arctic. It \[[Russia]{.mark}\] [will]{.mark} look to [defend its Arctic

competition.]{.underline} This [situation [heighten]{.mark}s the [risk
of a complete breakdown of]{.mark} the bilateral nuclear [arms
control]{.mark} architecture.]{.underline}

Vladimir Putin\'s state-of-the-nation speech in March 2018 made three
things abundantly clear. First, [the Russian
leadership is deeply concerned with US strategic missile
defence.]{.underline} This particular [Russian paranoia dates back at

As [the world became more dangerous in 2024, [the use of]{.mark} its
[most dangerous weapons has become more likely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This trajectory raises the stakes for the new Trump administration as it
tries to end [[wars in Europe and]{.mark} the [Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} and, more broadly, [to reverse the ominous
path toward the use [and proliferation of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} that has been accelerated by these
conflicts.]{.underline}

[Vladimir Putin became more aggressive in Ukraine]{.underline} last
year, [[engineer]{.mark}ing the [collapse of the nuclear
guardrails]{.mark} built over seven decades [between]{.mark} the [U.S.
and Russia]{.mark} and [lowering the threshold for the use of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} He announced that
[[Russian]{.mark} nuclear [forces]{.mark} were [on full]{.mark} combat
[alert]{.mark} and soon followed with military exercises to test the
readiness of Russia's non-strategic nuclear forces in a combat
scenario.'']{.underline}

[[Putin]{.mark} capped the year by launching Russia's new hypersonic
ballistic missile against targets in Ukraine, while formally announcing
a revised Russian nuclear doctrine that officially [lowered]{.mark} [the
threshold for]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [to
meet]{.mark} a [conventional threat]{.mark} to Russian
territory.]{.underline} The revised doctrine also states that [an attack
against Russia by a non-nuclear power with the participation or support
of a nuclear power will be seen as their joint attack on
Russia.]{.underline}

U.S. defense analysts assess that Russia is not preparing to use nuclear
weapons in Ukraine, and Putin's nuclear threats are dismissed by
Ukraine's supporters as "bluffs" to curtail support for Ukraine. [But
Putin's rhetoric and policy revisions have had a significant
effect.]{.underline}

[Prior to the war in Ukraine, it was extremely rare for American or
Russian leaders to imply a threat of nuclear use.]{.underline} [Putin's
threats have dramatically shifted the lexicon on nuclear use, lowering
the psychological barrier for use and reopening a debate in Ukraine on
whether that nation needs a nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. Such
rhetoric, combined with the change in strategic doctrine, lowers the
threshold for using nuclear weapons not only in the current conflict but
in future ones. Furthermore, [[Putin must recognize]{.underline}]{.mark}
that, [[to maintain deterrence,]{.mark} he cannot keep issuing threats
before [action is eventually required]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia's need for support in the Ukraine war and the [consequent 2024
[Russia-No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea mutual defense [treaty make it more
likely]{.mark} that an unpredictable [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea will
[gain]{.mark} more [sophisticated nuc]{.mark}lear knowledge and
[tech]{.mark}nology.]{.underline} Russia also led the effort in the U.N.
to ease the pressure on North Korea's nuclear program by vetoing a
resolution that would have extended the mandate of the panel tasked with
reporting on North Korea compliance with U.N. sanctions.

These developments, on the heels of [North Korea's announcement that it
would no longer seek reunification and reconciliation with South
Korea,]{.underline} have [[reopened debates in]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Japan]{.mark} [on whether]{.mark} a
[non-nuc]{.mark}lear [status still serves]{.mark} their [national
security interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Similarly, [the [Middle East war]{.mark} has [undermined]{.mark} nuclear
[guardrails]{.mark}. [Iran may become]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons
[state]{.mark} in response to Israel's debilitating attacks on it and
its proxies.]{.underline} This, in turn, has unleashed speculation as to
whether [[Israel will preempt such a possibility]{.mark} by escalating
the conflict with a direct attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
[Iran]{.mark}'s closer [coop]{.mark}eration [with Russia and
China]{.mark} has also [increased concerns]{.mark} about further
cooperation on developing Iran's nuclear capacity.]{.underline}

[Looming over the deterioration of the nuclear guardrails and
contributing to lowering the nuclear threshold is [China's rapid
expansion]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear [force]{.mark} in
2024.]{.underline} As the Defense Department's recent report on China's
military capabilities explains, [China "probably perceives that a
stronger nuclear force is needed to deter U.S. intervention, check
potential nuclear escalation or first strike, and will allow for
increased control of the scope and scale of escalation during a conflict
in a way its previously smaller and less diverse nuclear force could
not."]{.underline}

[[Further rais]{.mark}ing the [nuc]{.mark}lear [risk]{.mark} levels are
advancing technologies. AI can dangerously automate the command and
control of nuclear weapons. The increased role of nuclear energy to
address climate change could increase the spread of nuclear weapons
capability, unless diligently addressed.]{.underline}

warheads, Russia has 5,977, and the United States has 5,428, according
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's latest report.
The country with the third most nuclear warheads is China, with 350.
India and Pakistan have 160 and 165, respectively. 

[[A full-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[war \"would

is]{.underline} [[unprecedented
in]{.underline}]{.mark} human [[history,]{.underline}\"]{.mark} study
co-author Alan Robock, a professor of climate science at Rutgers
University in New Jersey, said at a news conference on Monday (August
15). [\"In]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [[U.S.-Russia nuclear
war,]{.underline} [more
people]{.underline}]{.mark} [would]{.underline} [[die]{.underline} \[[from
famine]{.underline}]{.mark}\] in India and Pakistan alone [[than
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the countries]{.underline} actually [[fighting
the war]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The most immediate effects of any
nuclear war, at least for those in a targeted city, have been popularly
known since the dropping of the U.S. atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" on the
Japanese city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6. 1945. The single bomb killed an
estimated 140,000 people within five months of its detonation and
destroyed or severely damaged more than 60,000 of the city\'s
approximately 90,000 buildings. Six eyewitness accounts, compiled by
journalist John Hersey and published in 1946, tell of the attack\'s
instantaneous devastation and its immediate aftermath. First, the light
of the bomb appeared as a blinding, \"noiseless\" flash as bright as the
sun; then the shock wave arrived, hurling bodies under toppling
buildings. In the aftermath, the clear, black shadows of the vaporized
dead were seen stenciled on the walls and streets, and the survivors who
were closely exposed to the blast emerged naked, their skin \"sloughed
off\" by the heat of the explosion, to wander the ruined city in stunned
bewilderment.

Studies sprung up as soon as 1947 to document the suffering following
the attack, which for many would last a lifetime. Radioactive fallout, a
byproduct of the nuclear fission reaction that gave Little Boy its
cataclysmic power, had blanketed the area. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
which was bombed three days later, increased rates of cancer, cataracts
and other health conditions persisted for years in survivors who had
been close to the bombs\' epicenters.

But it would take four more decades for scientists to begin to learn and
discuss the most lethal and frightening outcome of even a small-scale
nuclear war: so-called \"nuclear winter\". In this doomsday scenario,
radioactive dust and smoke would block out a significant portion of the
sun\'s light. With temperatures dropping, many of the world\'s crops,
smothered by the gloom, would die, creating a global famine and wiping
out billions of people.

 [To model how this]{.underline} apocalyptic event would affect the
planet\'s ability to sustain life, the [researchers
calculated]{.underline} the amount of [soot that would be generated
from]{.underline} six potential [nuclear war scenarios]{.underline}:
ranging from five scenarios based on a \"limited\" war between India and
Pakistan over the Kashmir region, which would produce 5.5 million to 52
million tons (5 million to 47 million metric tons) of soot depending on
the conflict\'s scale, to [full-scale global nuclear war involving the
U.S. and Russia, which would produce countless conflagrations veiling
the sky with 165 million tons (150 million metric tons) of
soot.]{.underline} 

With the soot quantities in hand, the scientists plugged the data into
the National Center for Atmospheric Research\'s (NCAR) Community Earth
System Model, a forecasting tool that simulates changes to Earth\'s
sunlight, temperature and precipitation. These changes were then fed
into NCAR\'s Community Land Model, which gave the scientists a
country-by-country breakdown of the dramatic reductions a nuclear winter
would bring to corn, rice, soybean, wheat and fish harvests.

Assuming that international trade stopped and that the remaining
resources weren\'t hoarded, the scientists subsequently calculated how
nuclear winter would reduce the food calories produced worldwide, as
well as the number of people who would starve as a consequence.

The [[researchers found]{.underline}]{.mark} that [in the
worst-case]{.underline} [scenario of a nuclear
war]{.underline} [[between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[U.S.
and Russia]{.underline}, [temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} on Earth\'s
surface [[would drop by]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as [[29
degrees]{.underline}]{.mark} Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius, or more
than three times the temperature difference between now and the last ice
age) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[5 billion people would
perish]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the most extreme war between India and
Pakistan, global calorie production could drop by 50%, causing 2 billion
deaths.

The longer-term consequences of nuclear war

In recent years, in some US military and policy circles, there has been
a growing perception that a limited nuclear war can be fought and
won. [Many]{.underline} [[experts believe]{.mark}, however, that
a]{.underline} [[limited nuclear war is unlikely to remain
limited]{.mark}. What starts with one tactical nuclear strike or a
tit-for-tat nuclear exchange between two countries could escalate to
an]{.underline} [[all-out nuclear war
end]{.mark}ing]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[immediate]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [utter
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark} of both countries.

But the catastrophe will not be limited to those two belligerents and
their allies.

[The long-term regional and global effects of nuclear explosions have
been overshadowed in public discussions by
the]{.underline} [[horrific]{.mark}, obvious,
local]{.underline} [[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} [of nuclear
explosions.]{.underline} Military planners have also focused on the
short-term effects of nuclear explosions because they are tasked with
estimating the capabilities of nuclear forces on civilian and military
targets. [[Blast]{.mark},]{.underline} [local
radiation]{.underline} [[fallout]{.mark},]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [[e]{.mark}lectro[m]{.mark}agnetic]{.underline} [[p]{.mark}ulse
(an intense burst of radio waves that can damage electronic

weapons---from a military perspective.

[But widespread fires and other global]{.underline} [[climatic
changes]{.underline}]{.mark} [resulting from many nuclear explosions
may]{.underline} [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} [be]{.underline} [[accounted]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [in

are]{.underline} [[difficult]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [predict]{.underline}]{.mark}[;]{.underline} assessing
them requires scientific knowledge that most military planners don't
possess or take into account[.]{.underline} Yet, in the few years
following a nuclear war, such collateral damage may be responsible for
the death of more than half of the human population on Earth.

While the world focuses on managing the consequences of novel
coronavirus, other global risks warrant political attention. [As the sea
ice retreats and the permafrost collapses due to climate
change, the growing nuclearisation of the Russian Arctic should
be high on this list.]{.underline}

[[The largest concentration of nuclear
installations]{.underline}]{.mark} -- both civilian and military --
[[is in Northern Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the Cold War, the
Soviet Union kept a significant portion of its nuclear
weapons arsenal in the Arctic, carried out extensive nuclear weapons
testing at Novaya Zemlya, and [used its waters as nuclear dump
sites]{.underline}.1 Russia's inability to effectively deal with this
nuclear legacy created the potential for an environmental
catastrophe and became a major post-Cold War challenge.2 During the
period 1996- 2006, defence agencies of [the United States and Norway --
later joined by the United Kingdom -- worked with Russia to jointly
manage transboundary radioactive waste issues under the aegis of the
Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation (AMEC) program.]{.underline}3

[Today, almost three decades after the international cleanup
started, a [new]{.mark} generation of nuclear [reactors are
coming]{.mark} to the Arctic. In]{.underline} 2019, The Independent
Barents Observer reported that there are 39 nuclear-powered vessels or
installations in the Russian Arctic, with a total of 62 reactors.4

This is set to increase considerably over the next 15 years. According
to some estimates, the [[Russian Arctic will constitute the most
nuclearised waters on the planet by 2035]{.mark}.]{.underline}5

[Russia's poor record on nuclear management, coupled
with insufficient emergency preparedness capabilities in the
Arctic, raises safety concerns]{.underline}. These include [potential
incidents involving nuclear contamination, which could severely harm the
Arctic marine environment and population alike, and pose a serious
threat to Russia, Europe, and potentially the United
States. ]{.underline}We should not wait to put in place early
warning and transparency mechanisms that reduce the risks of a dangerous
nuclear incident in the Arctic.

'Nuclearisation' of Russian Arctic in recent years

In 2018, the Russian government assigned the management of the Northern
Sea Route (NSR) to stateowned nuclear corporation Rosatom.6 With Rosatom
in charge, there has been a greater prioritisation of using nuclear
power for shipping, infrastructure development, and the extraction of
natural resources in the Russian Arctic.7

Russia's first floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, was
deployed in 2019 in Pevek to provide clean energy to people and
businesses across the Chukotka region.8 Rosatom sees this as a pilot
project and hopes to deploy a fleet of such units in Russia, and to
export this technology abroad.9

Only five nuclear-powered icebreakers exist in the world and they all
belong to Rosatom.10 By 2035, Russia's Arctic fleet is expected to
operate at least 13 heavy-duty icebreakers, nine of which will be
nuclear powered.11 In addition to crashing the ice to enable passage
along the NSR, the nuclear-powered '50 Years of Victory' also serves as
a North Pole expedition cruise for high paying travellers.12 Three such
voyages were initially planned for the summer of 2020 but were
cancelled.

Russia is also increasing the number of nuclear-powered submarines. The
Northern Fleet's submarine force currently consists of 32 vessels.13 [By
2027]{.underline}, [ten Borei-class (or fourth-generation ballistic
missile)]{.underline} [submarines will be built and commissioned, half
of which will serve in the Northern Fleet]{.underline}. In addition,
five Yasen-class submarines will be deployed with the Northern Fleet.14

[Not only are the numbers increasing but the levels
of [sub]{.mark}marine [activity]{.mark} are also [growing]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As Thomas Nilsen of the Barents Observer points out, ["[tensions between
Russia and NATO]{.mark} [have led to more sailings]{.mark} with
reactor-powered submarines, especially in the Norwegian, Barents- and
White Seas, but also under the ice in the high
Arctic."]{.underline}15 [Given the growing submarine activity, [the more
tensions rise, the more likely]{.mark} submarine [accidents will
be.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, [[Russia]{.mark} continues to [use the Arctic as a testing
site,]{.mark} most recently for its new nuclear-powered cruise-missile
and underwater drones.]{.underline}16 This Autumn, the Arctic waters
will be used to test-launch the nuclear-powered Poseidon underwater
device -- dubbed the 'doomsday drone'.17

In addition to increasing the number of reactors[, by
2030 the [Russia]{.mark}n government intends [to lift]{.mark} several
pieces of [radioactive debris]{.mark} from the seabed, including the
K-159 and the K-27 nuclear submarines, for decommissioning and long-term
storage]{.underline}.18 Although the cleanup is hailed as an important
first step to reduce risks from potential radioactive contamination of
the marine environment, Ingar Amundsen of the Norwegian Radiation and
Nuclear Safety Authority warned
that [[an accident]{.underline}]{.mark} during a [lifting
operation [could release]{.mark} more [radiation]{.mark} into the
environment.]{.underline}19 Conducting a risk assessment is important
for Russia to minimize these risks.

Russia's past and present nuclear practices

Russia has demonstrated that it has the technical know-how for operating
in Arctic conditions. However, [its poor record for nuclear safety
coupled with the increasing number of reactors in the Russian Arctic has
raised alarm among other Arctic states and environmental
groups.]{.underline}

From the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 to the Kursk submarine sinking in
2000, [[Russia's nuclear safety]{.mark} record [leaves much to be
desired.]{.mark}]{.underline} Last year alone, two deadly nuclear power
accidents occurred in the Russian Arctic. In July 2019, a fire broke out
on the specialpurpose nuclear-powered submarine Losharik, killing 14
sailors.20 One month later an explosion offshore of the Nyonoksa missile
site left five Russian nuclear scientists dead and three injured. The
explosion is believed to have been linked to the failed Skyfall missile
test.21

In these instances and in other cases, [Russia withheld critical
incident information about the severity and extent of radioactive
contamination in an attempt to evade accountability]{.underline}.22
Although Russia had signed a joint notification agreement on reporting
nuclear accidents with Norway, it did not provide an immediate alert to
the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority about a nuclear
incident in the Barents Sea when the Losharik incident occurred.23 The
official Russian news agency TASS reported the accident the following
day without specifying that the submarine was nuclear-powered.24

Another issue concerns the provision of radiation data. Soon after the
Skyfall explosion in August last year, Russian radiation monitoring
stations nearest to Nyonoksa went offline. When questioned, Russia
argued that the transmission of data from its radiation stations to the
nuclear test ban monitoring organisation, the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty Organisation (CTBTO), was voluntary and that the incident was not
a matter for the CTBTO. 25 This fueled suspicion that the radiation
could have been heavier than what was officially reported.

What keeps us up at night

[There is a long list of potential incidents that involve the possible
release of radioactive material in the Russian Arctic.]{.underline} Four
are highlighted here. [At the top of the list is the safety of the
[nuclear floating station]{.mark}, the Akademik Lomonosov.]{.underline}
Although Rosatom insists the plant is 'virtually unsinkable',26
environmentalists fear that [it [could be tossed by waves]{.mark} in
storms, [become steerless]{.mark} if the mooring breaks, [or hit an
iceberg]{.mark} and sink, causing substantial
contamination]{.underline}.27 Rising storm intensity, fueled by warming
oceans, heightens some of these risks. [Concerns have also been raised
about the lack of regulatory oversight of the plant's construction,
testing, fueling and its transport from the home port to
Pevek]{.underline}.28

Yet the riskiest operations take place within the city limits
of Murmansk. When not operating in ice-covered waters, icebreakers are
docked in the Rosatomflot's service base in Murmansk, where all fresh
and spent nuclear fuel is transported to and from.29 Service ships
storing spent nuclear fuel from the fleet of nuclear icebreakers are
also berthed there.30 "[An accident which releases radioactivity could
reach densely populated areas in Murmansk long before anyone manages to
trigger the emergency evacuation alarm]{.underline}," warns Thomas
Nilsen.31

[The third risk is linked to a potential [nuclear
shipping]{.mark} incident. Expanding LNG exports
from the Yamal Peninsula have been accompanied by a large increase in
nuclear-powered icebreaker escorts]{.underline}.32 In 2019,
nuclear-powered icebreakers accompanied a total of 510 vessels, an
increase of 54 percent compared to 2018.33 [With global warming, regular
commercial shipping in the Arctic will [increase the likelihood of
accidents]{.mark} triggered by extreme weather and climate events, such
as stronger winds, storms, and higher waves.]{.underline} One plausible
incident scenario involves [a collision of a foreign-owned LNG tanker
and Russian nuclearpowered icebreaker escort in a winter storm, with
a serious potential for release of radioactive
contaminants.]{.underline}34 The recent oil spill in Norilsk, caused by
the erosion of the surrounding permafrost, illustrates the considerable
risks that increasing economic activity can have on the regional
environment, as well as the catastrophic effect climate change is having
in the Arctic.35 [Ecological issues can, in turn, accelerate disease
spread and have detrimental effects on human health.]{.underline}

[Moreover, [given]{.mark} the [increased]{.mark} levels of
submarine [activity ]{.mark}in the Barents Sea
-- by both [Russia and NATO]{.mark} member states -- a serious
incident or [accident]{.mark} involving nuclear-powered submarines or
military vessels carrying nuclear
weapons [is]{.mark} practically [unavoidable]{.mark}.]{.underline} One
only needs to recall the 2009 collision of French and British submarines
in the Atlantic, which raised questions about the safety of ballistic
missile submarines patrolling the oceans while hiding their position.36
While a submarine accident in the deep ocean arguably carries fewer
risks -- owing to the massive dilution of radioactivity -- a submarine
collision in the shallow waters of the Barents Sea is an unknown
scenario [[with potentially disastrous
consequences.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The presence of radiological and [nuclear material poses]{.mark}
a [serious threat to the Arctic]{.mark} [marine]{.mark}
[environment]{.mark} [and]{.mark} industries,
including [fisheries]{.mark} and local food
sources.]{.underline}37 [Fishing is one of the most important
industries in the Arctic, representing large shares of gross domestic
product]{.underline} ([GDP]{.underline}) in some countries (e.g. 8,1% in
Iceland).38 In the case of Norway, a big share of exports come
from the Arctic in the form of seafood. [Any rumour of
leaking spent fuel -- let alone [an actual nuclear incident]{.mark} --
[could be devastating]{.mark} to the country's market and seafood
sales.]{.underline}39 These and other concerns have prompted Norway and
other Arctic states to cooperate with Russia in the field of nuclear and
radiation safety.

#### Biodiversity loss is existential.

**Torres 16**. Émile P. Torres is a philosopher and historian whose work
focuses on existential threats to civilization and humanity. They have
published on a wide range of topics, including machine
superintelligence, emerging technologies, and religious eschatology, as
well as the history and ethics of human extinction. Their forthcoming
book is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of

Catastrophic consequences for civilization. [The consequences
of]{.underline} this [rapid pruning of the evolutionary tree of life
extend beyond the obvious]{.underline}. There could be surprising
effects of biodiversity loss that scientists are unable to fully
anticipate in advance. For example, prior research has shown
that [localized]{.underline} [ecosystems can
undergo]{.underline} [abrupt]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [irreversible]{.underline} [shifts]{.underline} [when
they reach a]{.underline} [tipping point]{.underline}. According to a
2012 paper published in Nature, there are reasons for thinking that [we
may]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [approaching]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [tipping
point]{.underline} of this
sort [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [ecosystem,
beyond which the consequences could be]{.underline} [catastrophic for
civilization]{.underline}.

As the authors write, [a]{.underline} [planetary-scale
transition]{.underline} [could precipitate "substantial
losses]{.underline} [of ecosystem services]{.underline} [required to
sustain the human population."]{.underline} An ecosystem service is any
ecological process that benefits humanity, such as food production and
crop pollination. If the global ecosystem were to cross a tipping point
and substantial ecosystem services were lost, [the]{.underline} [results
could be]{.underline} ["widespread
social]{.underline} [unrest,]{.underline} [economic instability,
and]{.underline} [loss
of]{.underline} [human]{.underline} [life."]{.underline} According to
Missouri Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's
co-authors, this could occur in a matter of decades---far more quickly
than most of the expected consequences of climate change, yet equally
destructive.

[Biodiversity]{.underline} [loss is a]{.underline} ["threat
multiplier"]{.underline} [that, by]{.underline} [pushing societies
to]{.underline} [the brink of]{.underline} [collapse,
will]{.underline} [exacerbate]{.underline} [existing]{.underline} [conflicts]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [introduce
entirely new struggles between state and non-state actors. Indeed, it
could even]{.underline} [fuel]{.underline} [the rise
of]{.underline} [terrorism]{.underline}. (After all, climate change has
been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple high-ranking
US officials, such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA
director John Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism
are connected.)

The reality is that we are entering the sixth mass extinction in the
3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth, and the impact of this event
could be felt by civilization "in as little as three human lifetimes,"
as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the
widespread decline of biological populations could plausibly initiate a
dramatic transformation of the global ecosystem on an even faster
timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime.

The unavoidable conclusion is that [biodiversity
[loss]{.mark}]{.underline} [constitutes an]{.underline} [existential
threat]{.underline} in its own right. As such, [it ought to be
considered]{.underline} [alongside]{.underline} [climate
change]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [as
one]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} [most]{.underline} [significant]{.underline} [contemporary]{.underline} [risks]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [human]{.underline} [prosperity
and]{.underline} [survival]{.underline}.

mapping out what such a plan would like. Palmer hopes that a final
version will be formalized in Beijing in 2020.

years, [evidence of this staggering loss has begun
accumulating]{.underline}.

Wild animal populations have declined by 60% since 1970, more than
26,000 plants and animals are close to extinction, nearly two-thirds of
the world's wetlands and half of all rainforests have been destroyed,
more than 87% of the world's ocean area is dying, and [the planet

"This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature,

Russia's low intensity warfare operations in the Arctic

As a response to the sense of vulnerability in the AZRF, [[Russia is
becoming more confrontational]{.mark} in its approach towards regional
security and [finding excuses to 'defend' itself against perceived
external threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the Kremlin is taking stock
of the consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, [[Russia
will]{.mark} likely [conduct]{.mark} more [conventional power
demonstrations]{.mark}, sub-threshold activities, and grey zone
operations in the Arctic.]{.underline}

While there is little incentive for the Kremlin leadership to escalate
in the region per se, [there is also a strong willingness [to]{.mark}
continue probing and [test]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} resolve of the
Arctic]{.underline} 7 through a well-established toolkit of low
intensity warfare operations. [These sub-threshold operations and [grey
zone]{.mark} activities mostly take the form of:]{.underline}

[Brinkmanship-prone activities]{.underline} 12) through offensive
peacetime maneuvers at sea and in the air, especially close to the air
defense identification zones (ADIZ) of NATO countries and NORAD,

[Regular [snap military exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}, strategic
[[bomber overflights]{.underline}]{.mark} and patrol activities, and the
[[weaponization of]{.mark} notices to air missions]{.underline} 13)
([[NOTAM]{.underline}]{.mark}) in the Barents Sea, across North Pole
approaches, and close to the Bering Strait and Alaska -- including with
China14),

Seabed warfare activities15), and notably the disruption of critical
undersea infrastructure (CUI) such as energy pipelines and fiber optic
data cables across Arctic chokepoints,

GNSS/[[GPS jamming]{.underline}]{.mark} and recurrent [[electronic
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} operations16) in Lapland and Finnmark in
the European High North -- [[with severe risks for civilian and
commercial assets.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Risks of miscalculation]{.underline}

[A more vulnerable yet assertive Russia in the Arctic, coupled with more
[NATO attention]{.mark} towards the region, can only [mean]{.mark} that
the [risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation [provoked by civilian and military
accidents]{.mark}, incidents, and tactical errors will
increase.]{.underline} Because of the absence of clear lines of
communication and deconfliction between Russia and the Arctic 7
countries, [it could [lead to]{.mark} unintended [escalation]{.mark} and
further down the road, to military tension if not conflict]{.underline}.

This situation is worsened by the fact that [[Moscow's restraint]{.mark}
over such events [cannot be taken for granted]{.mark}
anymore]{.underline} -- as exemplified by [Russia's continued low
intensity warfare operations in peacetime against Arctic nations and
NATO allies]{.underline}. Finally, the absence of Russian transparency
regarding recent environmental disasters 17) in the region adds more
complexity to peacefully solving potential crises.

Another form of risk relates to [[horizontal escalation]{.mark} -- i.e.
military tension from other theaters such as the North Atlantic or the
North Pacific [spilling over into the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the context of the Finnish and Swedish adhesion to NATO, the Baltic Sea
represents a key area for horizontal escalation towards the Arctic.

Finally, [[miscalc]{.mark}ulations [could happen in]{.mark} the context
of Russian [sharp power activities]{.mark} in circumpolar
governance]{.underline} -- for instance, [the contestation of the
Svalbard Treaty with Norway or exploiting recent decisions]{.underline}
18) by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)
[regarding Russia and the United States. As a knee-jerk reaction, Moscow
also recently threatened to withdraw from the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea]{.underline} (UNCLOS).19)

Freedom of navigation?

[The [main risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation with Russia, however, pertains
[to]{.mark} Moscow's contestable [interpretation of]{.mark} the legal
status of the [Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline} (NSR). [For
years, the Kremlin has been projecting the NSR as a body of internal
waters covered by Article 234 of the Law of the Sea]{.underline} (also
known as the 'Ice Clause'), therefore offering Russian authorities the
possibility to enforce 'non-discriminatory laws and regulations'20) over
ice-covered areas.

The issue is twofold. On the one hand, the impact of [[climate
change]{.mark} is completely res[huffl]{.mark}ing]{.underline}
[[access]{.mark} to the AZRF,]{.underline} in turn [preventing Russia
from invoking the clause to increase control over the NSR because of
seasonal sea-ice reduction. On the other hand, Moscow's application of
'non-discriminatory' rules is, in fact, highly
discriminatory]{.underline}. Indeed, for the past few years, Russia has
been introducing stringent national regulations clearly violating UNCLOS
-- for instance by strengthening navigation rules and transit rights or
interdicting passage to foreign military assets21) through the NSR.

Moscow seeks to appropriate the NSR as a body of internal waters
regulated by Russian law, and no longer linked to UNCLOS under the
principles of freedom of navigation and innocent passage. [[This
obsession for control responds to the fear of 'encirclement]{.mark}' in
the Arctic and the unwarranted belief that NATO will soon contest the
self-appropriation of the NSR.]{.underline}

[[Russian fears]{.mark} have crystallized in the belief that NATO or the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates are willing to conduct a freedom of
navigation operation]{.underline} (FONOP) through the NSR [to
['test']{.mark} innocent [passage in contested
waters]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most of these fears remain unfounded,
especially since there is little value in arranging such an operation as
well as high operational risk.22)

The fact remains that the [Kremlin's rhetoric]{.underline} around a
potential Western-led FONOP [has grown aggressive in recent
months]{.underline}, with NATO arguably seeking to 'snatch'23) the NSR
from under Russia's control. Furthermore, [the Russian armed forces and
the FSB (in charge of the Coast Guard and Border Guard) have reportedly
been making plans to 'counter'24) a potential foreign
FONOP.]{.underline}

Policy consequences

[Under the impact of climate change and the subsequent increase in human
presence across the Arctic, Russia will find it harder to secure its
'new' Northern border in the AZRF]{.underline}. So far, Moscow's
response has been to approach the region through a military lens,
leading to perimeter control and sovereignty enforcement as well as the
deployment of Arctic-specific capabilities and the revamp of dual use
infrastructure.

[The Arctic remains key to national interests, and especially the
survivability of the sea-based nuclear deterrent on both sides of the
AZRF as well as the security of North Pole approaches in the central
Arctic.]{.underline}

[Russia's imperative to remove tension from the Arctic is consequently
[adding pressure on critical regional chokepoints]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- notably in the European High North with the Greenland-Iceland-United
Kingdom (GIUK) gap, the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) gap, and the
'Bear gap' (between the Svalbard archipelago, Bear Island, and mainland
Norway) as well as in the Pacific Arctic across the Bering Strait.

In the High North, [Russian actions are [heightening tension]{.mark}
across the North Atlantic sea lines of communication and on the
Nordic-Baltic continuum regarding NATO reinforcements]{.underline}. As
the Atlantic Alliance is taking stock of the Finnish and Sweden
accession, more policy attention will be required to determine the exact
role and place of NATO in a circumpolar environment.

#### [Rebalancing]{.underline} attention to the Arctic [fails]{.underline} and risks [miscalc]{.underline} with [Russia]{.underline}.

Russian Action in the Arctic"

// ***mosuQ*** Accessed 6-30-2025.

The same cannot be said for Europe or the Indo-Pacific, where U.S.
interests are considerably more robust. [Practically, [the shift in
U.S.]{.mark} and NATO [strategic goals]{.mark} that would be required to
match Russian capabilities and credibly compete with Moscow [in the
Arctic is **not feasible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Russia has
twenty-two fully operational military icebreakers, the United States
only has two. There is also no consensus within NATO if the Arctic is an
area of military concern; [Canada, an "Arctic Five" littoral state, has
said repeatedly that it does not believe NATO should play any role in
Arctic matters]{.underline}.

Given limited resources, the United States and NATO should be focusing
on regions of existing contention with Russia, not simply shifting
military capabilities to a region out of some ill-defined need to
"match" Russia.

[[Aggressively **rebalancing**]{.mark} Russia in the Arctic [is]{.mark}
also **[not desirable]{.mark}**. There are [many feasible scenarios
where **military confrontation** could break out]{.mark}---[over
**resource competition**, **territorial disputes**, and **unsanctioned
passage**]{.mark} through the Northern Sea Route, to name a few. But the
most plausible scenario that could drive military conflict and greater
frequency of Russian military exercises is a **larger NATO military
presence**]{.underline}. Given Moscow's sensitivity to strategic
encirclement, a concern that has extended into the Arctic,
[[increasing]{.mark} NATO [operations]{.mark} are likely to [contribute
to the **security dilemma** and increase the **likelihood of
misperception and miscalculation**]{.mark}, undermining strategic
stability [in a rapidly changing region where there is]{.mark} currently
**[no mechanism for dialogue]{.mark}** on security issues]{.underline}.

The United States and its allies must find a way to preserve their
influence in an increasingly important region without making military
conflict more likely. For one, improving intelligence, reconnaissance,
surveillance (ISR) and communications infrastructure is a pivotal,
though less antagonistic, way to improve Arctic operational readiness.
The United States and its allies could utilize unmanned aerial systems,
high altitude balloons, and satellites in highly elliptical orbits
(HEO), which spend extended periods over the Arctic, to close the
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) gap and monitor Russian assets
in the region. Perhaps more importantly, since there is currently no
Arctic security forum that includes Russia, Arctic states should use
NATO's established dialogue channels with Moscow through the NATO-Russia
Council, as Dr. Rebecca Pincus has advocated. While NATO's military
function would be counterproductive, its political-organizational
function could help to lower the likelihood of miscommunication. This
forum would also open the possibility for greater collaboration on rules
to govern the region as it becomes more accessible to other actors.

[Ultimately, [at a time of **extreme regional flux**, it would be a bad
idea to **aggressively rebalance to the Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia's approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the
Arctic]{.underline} [[is]{.underline} [rooted
firmly]{.underline}]{.mark} [its overarching national security
objectives]{.underline}. In addition, Russia's th[awing Arctic border

nuclear deterrent]{.mark}, including]{.underline} [at
least]{.underline} [[7 of its 10 SSBNs]{.mark}, along
the]{.underline} [[Kola Peninsula]{.mark}.13 Indeed,
the]{.underline} [[Arctic plays a]{.underline} [central
role]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[strategic
deterrence posture]{.mark}.]{.underline} In accordance with
its ["Bastion" defense concept, the]{.underline} [[Northern

to]{.underline} [[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[second-strike

highly integrated anti-access/area
denial]{.underline} [(A2/AD)]{.underline} [capabilities in close
proximity, including]{.underline} [coastal missile defenses, aircraft,
and]{.underline} [surface vessels]{.underline}.14 Indeed, strategic
bombers and anti-submarine aircraft routinely patrol over Arctic waters,
and three bases located along Northern Sea Route choke points are
outfitted with S-400 systems and Bastion-P cruise missiles. 

[Russia's Arctic military buildup and exercises suggest
a]{.underline} [[focus
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [an]{.underline} [[echeloned
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline} [[protect its territory
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [SSBN fleet]{.underline}---it is increasing the
number of S-400 missile defense batteries across its Arctic territory;
Kotelny Island and Novaya Zemlya are equipped with Bastion-P and
Pantsir-S1 missile defense systems and backed up by advanced anti-ship
missiles; and Moscow is conducting submarine patrols through maritime
choke points such as the Greenland-Iceland-United KingdomNorway (GIUK-N)
Gap.15 Nonetheless, Russia's northern bastions are increasingly capable
of taking on more expansive missions, potentially allowing it to project
power and extend its influence into the NSR and Arctic.16 This buildup
could serve similar operational purposes to bastions Russia is creating
in Kaliningrad and the Black Sea, where its military has similarly
massed A2/AD capabilities, capable of engaging targets at longer ranges
and serving as fortified forward basing for missions into surrounding
areas.17

According to Russian officials and state press, the Russian government
has resumed operations at over 50 Soviet-era military bases in the
Arctic, including 10 radar stations and 13 air bases.18 And, as Russian
president Vladimir Putin announced in June 2020, [Russia
will]{.underline} [elevate]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [Northern
Fleet]{.underline} [to the level of a]{.underline} [de facto separate
military district]{.underline} [beginning in January 2021, highlighting
the]{.underline} [growing
military]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [strategic
importance]{.underline} [Russia attaches to the
region.]{.underline} (Russia has four other geographic military
districts.)19 Russia also believes that the United States intends to
increase its economic and military presence in the region.

Testing of military readiness is frequent; the Northern Fleet conducted
4,700 exercises and 3,800 test combat training exercises in 2017, for
example.20 In October 2019, Russia ran its
largest [[strategic]{.underline} [nuclear
exercise]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the Arctic,
Grom-2019,]{.underline} [[involving tactical and
strategic]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear]{.underline} [[forces]{.underline}]{.mark} [(including
a road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM)]{.underline} [[and all
four]{.underline}]{.mark} [of its naval]{.underline} [[fleets]{.mark},
indicating]{.underline} [Moscow's]{.underline} [[willingness
to]{.underline} [mobilize assets]{.underline} [from
all]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[military
districts]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [utilize
ballistic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [cruise
missiles]{.underline} [[to]{.underline} [defend]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [territory]{.underline} [[in
a conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.21

The [[Kola]{.underline}]{.mark} [Peninsula]{.underline} [[is central
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}. The centrality of the Kola Peninsula to
Russian defense in its northwest dates back to the Cold War, when it
stationed strategic bombers at what is now its Severmorsk-1 air base.
After a period of relative inactivity and decline of its military
installations on the peninsula following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, [Moscow is continuing to modernize and expand several bases
located in and around the Kola Peninsula, including its Severomorsk-1
air base, Gadzhiyevo submarine base, and Okolnaya submarine support
base.22 The air base upgrades in particular
are]{.underline} [[enhancing]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[ability]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [A2/AD]{.underline} [defense

deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark} [along the Kola Peninsula]{.underline},
where it also [periodically tests sea- and land-based ballistic
missiles]{.underline}.23 Moscow is [reconstituting its SSBN fleet---it
currently has four Borei-class fourthgeneration SSBNs, with plans to
eventually have at least 10 in total.]{.underline}24 Moscow currently
expects to complete its first eight ships by 2023 and the last two by
2027. Public reporting suggests five of these SSBNs will join the
Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severmorsk on the Kola Peninsula, and
five will be deployed to the Pacific Fleet.25 The Kola submarine bases
contain extensive submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) storage
and loading facilities, and Okolnaya may store nuclear warheads.26

MSU-shARK Accessed 7-28-25.

This article discussed why [[U.S. and Russian]{.mark} forces stopped
antagonizing each other on both sides of the Bear Gap]{.underline}.
Based on Schelling's brinkmanship theory, the analysis explored the
[relationship between military restraints and war
avoidance]{.underline}. Plausible explanations of "broader security
concerns" and "strategic necessity" were discussed. Which conclusion can
be deduced?

The main finding is that [[brinkmanship ceased]{.mark} because [Russia's
invasion]{.mark} in Eastern-Europe [made]{.mark} it too dangerous for
the two rivals to continue a ["tit-for-tat"]{.mark} logic outside
Norway.]{.underline} As Europe's largest war since 1945 unfolded[, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} [Russia could no longer
push]{.mark} each other [to]{.mark}wards the brink of [war]{.mark}. In
the [post-Ukrainian]{.mark} security environment, [both nuclear powers
accept]{.mark} that inadvertent [crises must be mitigated]{.mark}.
Fearing the Ukraine war will escalate beyond its borders, [both]{.mark}
parties have [tempered their Arctic saber rattling]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As seen from Moscow and Washington D.C., [an Arctic salami-tactic aiming
to install fear,]{.underline} uncertainty and ultimately [coerce the
other part to step down]{.underline} in the Norwegian Sea has become
irresponsible. [The fact that no provocative incidents have been
reported on either side of the Bear Gap signifies a tacit cooperation
between the two protagonists. U.S. and Russian state leaders stick to a
"gentleman's agreement". This is not out of sympathy for each other but
out of fear, anxiety and a mutual respect for each other's destructive
power.]{.underline}

Paradoxically, [therefore, [Russia's failed attempt to]{.mark} rapidly
[seize Ukraine]{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} more [Arctic]{.mark}
predictability. Russia's failure to win decisively in Eastern Europe
has, in relative terms, led to more crisis stability outside
Norway.]{.underline} The General Staff's military blunder and [failed
coup d'état in Kyiv]{.underline} has [become a regional
[tranquilizer]{.mark} in one of the most sensitive operational areas on
Earth.]{.underline} The finding coincides with conclusions drawn by
Kristian Åtland et al., claiming

\[...\] the dominant pattern of Russia's sea and air exercises on NATO's
northern flank has changed significantly in the time that has passed
since February 2022. Particularly noteworthy is the shift in location
\[...\] from the Norwegian Sea to the Barents Sea.83

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the pause in March [[2022, cooperation has

cooperation in the six working groups.

The new [[regional realities have]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's approach to China's Arctic
ambitions. Whereas [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} was previously
skeptical about [[welcoming Beijing into Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}

Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out
in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to
Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in
Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday's talks were
the first contact between officials from the two sides [[following
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [[call between Trump and
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} last week.

He commented on the economic track of the talks, which he described as
good, but declined to go into detail on the political discussions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve
Witkoff.

"Positive after the Biden administration destroyed all of the
communication, destroyed all of the discussion," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300 billion as a result of
leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022.

"There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the
U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and [there are ways to
have productive cooperation benefit both Russia and the
U.S.]{.underline}" he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think [[joint investments between Russia and the U.S. are
now more likely]{.mark} after this meeting [than before]{.mark}," he
added.]{.underline}

On next steps, Dmitriev said the two sides had agreed to set up working
groups and have regular high-level contacts. No further meetings have
yet been scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

Advancing [[US Arctic Policy]{.underline}]{.mark}

NSAR 2022 updated the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region to
take account of the new circumstances facing the Arctic and to
incorporate new scientific understanding of the region. More than 15
Federal Departments and Agencies contributed to the policy, with input
from the State of Alaska, Alaska Tribes and organizations, civil
society, and Arctic Allies and partners.

While reaffirming long-standing US interests in and approaches to the
Arctic, NSAR 2022 takes account of Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine and associated consequences for the Arctic. NSAR 2022 also
addresses the climate crisis with greater urgency, given the rapid pace
of changes underway, and directs new investments in sustainable
development to improve livelihoods for Arctic residents, while
conserving the environment.

NSAR 2022 begins with a vision for the Arctic: "The United States seeks
an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and cooperative."
That vision, also reflected in the 2022 National Security Strategy,
remains the desired end-state, notwithstanding the challenges resulting
from Russia's war in Ukraine. In pursuit of this end-state, NSAR 2022 is
organized around four mutually reinforcing pillars, spanning domestic
and international issues: Security, Climate Change and Environmental
Protection, Sustainable Economic Development, and International
Cooperation and Governance.

[The United States [has made good progress]{.mark}]{.underline} in
implementing NSAR 2022, as detailed in the implementation report noted
above. Below are a few illustrative actions that advance the objectives
in those four pillars, beginning with Pillar 1 (Security):

[Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline},
[[Finland and Sweden became NATO members]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[enabled the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to improve]{.mark} collective [deterrence in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and enhanced its ability to respond to
contingencies in the region. The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[strengthened readiness through increased
training]{.mark} with Allies and partners. And]{.underline} [it worked
to reduce risks of conflict in the Arctic, to prevent unintended
escalation or miscalculation, and to improve the security of the
[US]{.mark} Arctic homeland.]{.underline}

[The United States, Canada, and Finland signed a Memorandum of
Understanding [creat]{.mark}ing the [Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
in]{.mark} November [2024]{.mark} [to promote the production]{.mark} of
polar icebreakers and other capabilities alongside US Allies and
partners, [labor, and industry.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[collaborat]{.mark}ed bilaterally [with Canada]{.mark} through various
venues]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark}]{.underline} the binational
[North American [Aerospace Defense]{.mark}
Command]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [the [Arctic Security Forces]{.mark}
Roundtable, the [Arctic Coast Guard]{.mark} Forum[,]{.mark} and the
Canada-United States Arctic Dialogue.]{.underline} The Arctic Dialogue
was launched as part of the Roadmap for a Renewed US-Canada partnership
established by President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau in 2021.

To address the accelerating climate change challenge in the Arctic, and
to deal with other environmental concerns (Pillar 2):

The BHA took steps to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035 and
achieve net zero emissions by 2050, advance adaptation and resilience in
addition to mitigation, include nature-based solutions alongside
technical approaches, pursue both land- and ocean-based approaches,
recognize the need to remove carbon from the atmosphere and not just
reduce emissions, measure greenhouse gas emissions in addition to
estimating them, and provide useful climate data, products, and
information to enable decision-makers from communities, businesses, and
governments to make science-based, informed decisions. For example,

Recognizing there is no path to net zero without the ocean, the
Administration also produced the first Ocean Climate Action Plan and the
associated National Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal Research Strategy.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) detailed not only current
and expected climate impacts to all regions of the United States,
including Alaska, but also the bold climate actions underway in every
state, including Alaska. The associated NCA Atlas makes downscaled
climate data and projections readily available, thus vastly enhancing
NCA5's utility to Alaskans and those working with them.

The National Climate Resilience Framework underscores the need for
action to adapt to climate changes already underway and to enhance the
resilience of communities, economies, and ecosystems; Federal Agency
Climate Adaptation Plans and a review of resilience progress document
the achievements to date.

The federal government has made unprecedented technical assistance and
resources available to support Community-Driven Relocation.

The Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
CHIPS and Science Act all provide urgently needed resources to implement
the above-named strategies and commitments.

[[US]{.underline}]{.mark} government agencies---heeding the above
strategies, [[tapping]{.underline}]{.mark} the above-named
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, following extensive evaluation, and in
consultation with rural Alaskan communities---made significant changes
to their programs and funding opportunities to address the specific
needs [[of Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} communities. The changes have
enabled communities facing multiple challenges to maintain viable
economies while addressing a rapidly changing environment.

\[Paragraph integrity pauses\]

Due in part to these changes, the US Government was able to provide
significant assistance to rural Alaska Native communities that are
facing confounding decisions on whether to relocate entirely, to engage
in "managed retreat," or to protect in place in response to extensive
floods, erosion, and permafrost subsidence that is rapidly sloughing
away land. Examples of this assistance include the following: The
Department of the Interior (DOI) provided \$21.8 million in 2022 and
\$30.4 million in 2023 to Alaskan Tribes and Tribal organizations under
its Tribal Community Resilience Annual Awards program, primarily through
funding appropriated pursuant to the BIL and the IRA. DOI also allocated
\$55 million in 2024 under this program, but as of this writing the fate
of this funding is uncertain due to a freeze in the disbursement of
federal funds mandated by the Trump Administration. USDA funded 17
watershed and flood prevention projects in Alaska that are focused on
community-driven relocation, managed retreat, or protect-in-place. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided to the State
of Alaska more than \$38 million in Community Development Block
Grant--Disaster Recovery/Mitigation funding. HUD also awarded the
communities of Golovin and Newtok \$900,000 each in Community
Development Block Grant--Imminent Threat funding. In 2024, the community
of Newtok largely completed its relocation to Mertarvik. Decisions on
providing these types of assistance relied to a significant degree on a
growing body of research concerning the environmental threats facing
Alaskan communities. The United States also took steps to protect the
Northern Bering Sea, which supports one of the largest marine migrations
on Earth, critical fisheries, and seabird habitats, and is home to
countless species of marine plants and animals. President Biden
re-established the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area (NBSCRA)
through an Executive Order that also created a federal task force to
address challenges affecting these waters. The Executive Order also
provided for the establishment of the Bering Intergovernmental Tribal
Advisory Council (BITAC). In October 2024, the federal task force
partnered with the BITAC to develop and sign a Joint Vision Statement to
address the crisis resulting from historically low returns of salmon to
the Norton Sound and the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers. The Yukon and
Kuskokwim salmon runs are a foundational economic and cultural force for
many Alaskan communities, and the declines have had wide-reaching
consequences for Alaska. The Joint Vision Statement and DOI's Gravel to
Gravel Initiative represent significant steps toward the complex
coordination needed to address the salmon crisis on the basis of science
and Indigenous Knowledge. To promote sustainable economic development in
the Arctic (Pillar 3): The US Government allocated \$7.6 billion in BIL
funding for use in Alaska, with more than 1,863 specific projects
identified for funding. Projects involved the transportation sector
(e.g., funding for roads, bridges, public transit, ports, and airports),
clean water and water infrastructure, and broadband expansion, among
other things. The United States made considerable progress in extending
broadband services throughout Alaska, including to rural areas, through
programs administered by NTIA, USDA, and the FCC. The US Army Corps of
Engineers, in partnership with the City of Nome, began designing
modifications to the Port of Nome to provide larger vessels with
improved access to Nome's existing harbor by enlarging the outer basin
and creating a new deep-water basin with a depth of 40 feet. Congress
appropriated an initial \$250 million for this project. In 2023, the US
Geological Survey provided more than \$5.8 million in funding to the
Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys to support
airborne geophysical data collection and geologic mapping focused in
regions with prospects for hosting critical mineral resources. Finally,
to advance international cooperation and governance (Pillar 4):

Department also issued fact sheet with additional information about this
historic announcement. The announcement followed two decades of the
largest-ever offshore mapping effort by NOAA and USGS to collect data on
the seabed and subsoil in many areas off the coasts of the United
States, including in the Arctic.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} September [[2024]{.underline}]{.mark}, the

the overlap in continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean. The task force,
which began negotiations in November 2024, reflects the commitment of
the United States and Canada to further define their shared northern
boundary through cooperative bilateral negotiation and meaningful
engagement with State, Territorial, and Indigenous partners.

MSU-shARK Accessed 6-30-2025.

Unlike the US, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} does not have stealthy
strategic bombers (for now). Instead, it [has air-launched cruise
missiles (ALCMs), shorter-range missiles, and nuclear gravity bombs that
would be launched from heavy bombers]{.underline}.\[15\] While they lack
stealth technology, Russia's [[heavy bombers maintain]{.mark}
their survivability by being able
to]{.underline} [[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} [cruise
missiles]{.underline} [[from really far
away]{.underline}]{.mark} ([thousands of kilometers), [shielding them
from
US air]{.mark}]{.underline} [defense [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
fighter aircraft]{.underline} (Military Watch, 2018). So, my sense is
that [Russia's heavy bombers]{.underline} have comparable survivability
to the US's stealthy strategic bombers. Like the US air-based nuclear
forces, Russia's is vulnerable at a few 'choke points' --- before take
off, mid-attack, and during refueling and repair ---
but [is]{.underline} [overall very
survivable. [While]{.mark}]{.underline}, as I described
above, [[radar and]{.mark} other [tech]{.mark}nologies [are improving]{.mark}, Russia's heavy [bombers will]{.mark} likely [remain]{.mark} relatively [survivable]{.mark}]{.underline} for
the time being.

This in mind, I expect some fraction of Russian heavy bombers to be
destroyed during a counterforce attack, but I believe many or [most
would remain unscathed.]{.underline} I guess that [somewhere between 60%
and 100%]{.underline} (280 and 470) [of Russia air-based nuclear
warheads would survive a first strike.]{.underline}\[16\]

Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)

Within the ICBM leg of the triad, deployed ICBMs can be further broken
down into: silo-based ICBMs, which both the US and Russia have, and
"road-mobile" ICBMs, which only Russia has.

Like the US's land-based nuclear forces, Russia's silo-based ICBMs would
be vulnerable to attack. Also, like the US's land-based forces,
super-hardened silos would make the destruction of 100% of Russia's
silo-based nuclear weapons extremely costly, but improvements in US
technology mean the US could get reasonably close (Lieber & Press,
2017a; McKinzie, eds. 2001). For example, the accuracy of US long-range
ballistic missiles has improved dramatically since the end of the Cold
War as a result of substantial progress in submarine geolocation and
missile guidance systems. Whereas in 1985 US SLBMs had only a 9% change
of effectively destroying a hardened silo, today that chance has
increased to 90% (Lieber & Press, 2017b, p. 3).

[[Russia's]{.mark} road-mobile land-based [ICBMs]{.mark} have the
additional tactical challenge of being 'relocatable.]{.underline}'
Through bilateral arms control treaties, Russia has shared the
coordinates of locations associated with a number of mobile ICBMs
(associated garrisons, parking sites, etc.) (McKinzie, eds. 2001). The
US also has intelligence on the dispersal patterns of road-mobile ICBMs,
satellite imaging that's high-resolution enough to see road-mobile ICBMs
(as long as they aren't in underground tunnels), and the ability to
monitor communications between road-mobile missiles (McKinzie, eds.
2001; Lieber & Press, 2017a).

According to McKinzie et al., road-mobile missiles are kept stationary
at garrisons and parking sites periodically (2001). Many of them would
only 'disperse' after a first strike early warning. Any road-mobile
missiles still in the garrisons by the time a first strike arrived would
be destroyed with relative ease. One to two 300kt nuclear warheads
allocated per garrison known to be sheltering road-mobile ICBMs would
yield a high probability of successfully destroying the missile systems
positioned there (McKinzie et al., 2001).

What's more, the launch sites that would be used by Russia's mobile
missiles are both relatively easy to identify and easy to target,
meaning the US would have some success destroying road-mobile missiles
even after they'd dispersed (McKinzie et al., 2001).

But [road-mobile missiles that have been mobilized and aren't positioned
at a launch site would be much harder to target]{.underline}, and in
fact, used to be [considered]{.underline} ["inherently
survivable"]{.underline} (see a discussion of the general consensus
about this in Long & Green, 2014; McKinzie, eds. 2001, 54). According to
Long and Green, "In particular, [mobile nuclear weapons]{.underline} ---
'relocatable targets' in the common parlance
--- [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [now generally viewed
as]{.underline} [[untargetable]{.mark} in a first
strike]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} [[secure]{.underline} [second
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}[ has
therefore]{.underline} [[become]{.underline}]{.mark} [almost]{.underline} [[synonymous]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
state possessing]{.underline} significant numbers of \[SLBMs\]
and/or [[mobile]{.underline}]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([[ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark})" (2014, p. 40).

Once located, road-mobile missiles are easier to destroy, even while
moving, as they have weaker defenses than silo-based missile systems
(Long & Green, 2014; Acton, 2010). In fact, a nuclear bomb wouldn't have
to detonate particularly close a road-mobile target to it to destroy it.
For example, a 100kt ICBM detonated in the air would damage a
road-mobile missile system anywhere within an area of 26 square
kilometers (McKinzie, eds. 2001). And if the bomb detonated is big
enough, the road-mobile missile system wouldn't be able to drive outside
the radius of the detonation quickly enough to escape the blast, even
with early warnings.

According to Long and Green (2014), improvements in technology, in
particular by the US, is getting closer to being able to locate
road-mobile ICBMs.\[17\] Modern sensors now take advantage of techniques
like spectroscopy and interferometry, among others, allowing them to,
for example, detect vapors that leak out of missile silos and trucks
from a distance (Lieber & Press, 2017). Similarly, remotely piloted
vehicles like drones will be able to monitor the movement of
mobile-ICBMs, allowing the US to finally track mobile-ICBMs over time
after they've been identified (Lieber & Press, 2017).

But according to James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program
and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
"[[locating]{.mark} mobile [ballistic missiles is exceptionally
hard]{.mark}," and [even]{.mark}
taking [improvements in US tech]{.mark}nology into account, "it is
[still]{.mark} fiendishly [difficult to locate]{.mark} mobile
[missiles]{.mark} hidden by a well-prepared enemy"]{.underline} (Acton,
2010). We\'re just not at the point where we can reliably detect and
track road-mobile nuclear forces.

Taken together, I expect that --- assuming Russia didn't launch on
warning --- between 75% and 99% (340--440) of Russia's silo-based ICBMs
and between 10% and 50%, or (30--120) of its road-mobile ICBMs would be
destroyed in a US first strike.

Russia's Missile Defense Systems

According to CSIS Missile Defense Project,
\"[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [now]{.underline} [[possesses]{.underline}]{.mark} [some
of]{.underline} [[the]{.underline} [most advanced air and missile
defense]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
world]{.underline}" with missile defense systems across the country,
and **[68 nuclear-armed interceptors]{.underline}** are located
surrounding Moscow (2018; Secretary of Defense, 2019). To date, [the
defense systems have been limited to destroying aircraft, drones, cruise
missiles, and short- to intermediate-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline}, but [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [arrival of
Russia's]{.underline} [[newest surface-to-air
missile]{.underline}]{.mark} (the S-500) in 2020 [may allow it
to]{.underline} [[target US ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ritzen,
2018; CSIS).\[18\]

But my impression is that these systems are intended to protect the
capitol --- not necessarily to protect Russia's nuclear arsenal. I
therefore don't expect them to have any meaningful impact on the
survivability of its nuclear arsenal.

Surviving a US first strike

Taken together, I expect that Russia's nuclear forces would likely fare
a bit worse than the US's during a first strike. If we assume that
Russia's deployed nuclear forces are distributed across the three legs
of its triad in proportion to the distribution of its strategic
warheads[,]{.underline} [[Russia could be left
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [up
to]{.underline} [[1,240]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear]{.underline} [[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} [after
a first strike]{.underline}. Realistically though, I expect it would be
far fewer --- [perhaps as few as 450]{.underline}.[ In either
case]{.underline}, [Russia would still be able to
mount]{.underline} [a formidable second strike\[19\].]{.underline}

Like above, my conclusions could be quite different if it turned out
either the US or Russia were being deceptive about the size,
composition, and capabilities of their nuclear arsenals or missile
defense systems. While I think it's relatively less likely that the US
would execute a cyberattack to augment a first strike against Russia,
cyberattacks and other unknowns add to my uncertainty.

Conclusion

For now, [it seems like]{.underline} [[neither the US nor Russia
would]{.underline}]{.mark} [likely]{.underline} [[be able to execute a
'perfect' counterforce strike]{.underline},]{.mark} making it unlikely
for either to put an immediate end to the nuclear exchange.
Uncertainties about deception, cyberattacks, and other unknowns, I
expect that [between \~990 and \~1,500 of the US's deployed nuclear
warheads and between \~450 and\~1,240 of Russia's deployed nuclear
warheads would survive a first strike]{.underline}. However,
improvements in technology could substantially threaten the
survivability of deployment systems that have been considered
'inherently survivable' for decades.

*The process of accidental war*

[[There is a]{.underline} **[divide]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the process of [[accidental war]{.mark}
assumed [in]{.mark}]{.underline} game-theoretic
[**[models]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
process]{.underline} of accidental war as [discussed in]{.underline}
much of the **[[lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}** on crisis management.
The game-theoretic mechanism of a move by Nature that takes you to war
is the core of this distinction between the two. It means that war does
not result from decisions to go to war, it results from chance, as
represented in Figure 3. [The]{.underline} **[[central]{.mark}
element]{.underline}** [[is that something]{.underline}
**[inadvertent]{.underline}**]{.mark}---an accident, mistaken warning,
or some unauthorized action---[happens]{.underline}, [which [results
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [This
happens]{.underline} [**[purely]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[chance]{.underline}**, **[without]{.underline}**]{.mark} any
**[[choice]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on the part of decision
makers]{.underline}. Leaders might have chosen to take escalatory steps
that increased the likelihood that events spiraled out of control, such
as in Powell's (1990) model of brinkmanship, but this could only occur
before the accident because an actual decision to go to war is
irrational. **[[No war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [occurred in this

are]{.underline} **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** empirical
**[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [correspond]{.mark} to this

[This stands [in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[stark contrast]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the process]{.underline} of accidental war
usually [laid out in [discussions]{.mark}]{.underline} of crisis
management, as illustrated in Figure 4. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
process **[[adds]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a step between the]{.underline}
inadvertent [event and war]{.underline}: [[the]{.underline} **[leader's
choice]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to go to war]{.underline}. For example,
in each of the three American Indian Wars that he identifies as
accidental, Szarejko (2021) describes how leaders chose to fight
following some inadvertent action. Similarly, concerns about launch on
warning nuclear command and control systems are centered on the idea
that false warnings might lead to a decision to launch a nuclear strike
against the enemy, which in turn would lead to war. Unlike the model
outlined in Figure 3, a few wars have occurred following the dynamics
highlighted in Figure 4. Probably the best example is the
Spanish--American War, with the explosion of the USS *Maine* providing
the accidental trigger to the crisis that resulted in the decisions by
the United States and Spain to go to war.

\[FIGURE EXCLUDED\]

[The fact that war results]{.underline} here [from leaders' choices
would]{.underline} seem to [indicate that]{.underline}
[**[no]{.underline}** [war is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[truly
[accidental]{.mark}]{.underline}** or inadvertent, even from accidental
war advocates' own perspective. After all, if war results from choices,
not from chance, then it isn't accidental or inadvertent, as discussed
earlier. Further, **[[mistaken warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [seems to
be at the]{.underline} **[core]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} many
[concerns]{.underline} about accidental nuclear war (Blair, 1993, 1994;
Feaver, 1992, 1994; Sagan, 1993, 1994; Thayer, 1994), [but
this]{.underline} really [[seems to be]{.mark} an argument
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} the danger created by **[[incomplete
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}**. For example, [Utgoff]{.underline}
(1985: 126) [suggests]{.underline} on-site **[monitoring]{.underline}**
[as a way]{.underline} "[for]{.underline} **[reducing]{.underline}**
[the probability]{.underline} of accidental nuclear war."
[[The]{.underline} **[only way]{.underline}** [for monitoring to
affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark} of war
[[is]{.mark} through [making]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} available to decision makers **[more
[complete]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Info]{.mark}rmation revelation [can
affect the likelihood]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[choose]{.mark} to go to
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} it [**[will
not]{.underline}** [affect]{.underline}]{.mark} [the probability
that]{.underline} a [[war]{.mark} results [from]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[chance]{.underline}**]{.mark} rather than choice.

[[Incomplete info]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[well
known]{.underline}** as a cause of war (Fearon, 1995), [and]{.underline}
it is [**[already]{.underline}** [accounted for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} game-theoretic models of deterrence, including ones
that feature accidental war as a mechanism (e.g. Powell, 1990) and
[models that]{.underline} **[do not allow]{.underline}** [accidental
war]{.underline} (e.g. Zagare and Kilgour, 2000). While incomplete
information can certainly make the difference between peace and war, a
war that results from deliberate decision-making, even in the face of
uncertainty or incomplete information, is not accidental or inadvertent.
[Thus]{.underline}, [[both]{.underline} **[logic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence contradict]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
notion of [[accidental war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, even if it is universally accepted that accidental or
inadvertent wars have never happened---a very unlikely prospect---that
would not be enough to convince some that they have overstated the risk
of inadvertent nuclear war. For example, Sagan (1993: 263) argues that
"prenuclear history is a very poor guide in this matter. Not only should
one worry more about rare events when nuclear weapons are involved; but
the nuclear weapons arsenals we have created appear to have themselves
increased the likelihood of accidental war."

*Why the focus on accidental war?*

So why do [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to talk about the
possibility of accidental or inadvertent war even in the face of logic
and evidence against it? Trachtenberg (2000: 23) argues that the crucial
reason is not because these scholars are dishonest or stupid, it is that
"people [**[want]{.underline}** [to believe]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[the military]{.mark}]{.underline} system [[can]{.mark} be
a]{.underline} **[major [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}." They want to believe that rigid war plans,
renegade military officers, and/or the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack all pose serious threats to the prospects for peace.

**[[The]{.mark}re is a venerable [arg]{.mark}ument [that states]{.mark}

between the two great powers **[escalate]{.underline}**.
**[Nevertheless, [history shows]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[big wars
[don\'t]{.mark} just [happen]{.mark} inadvertently]{.underline}**. 

The accidental war thesis
was [[raised]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-03/beware-guns-august-asia?utm_medium=social) recently
by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia. **[Noting the many
flashpoints at which U.S. and Chinese interests collide, he argued that
there is a growing danger of them "stumbling into
conflict."]{.underline}** An accidental collision between ships or
planes in the South China Sea, or several other plausible scenarios,
could lead to crisis, escalation and war. **[Just as the great powers of
the early 20th century
"[sleep-walked](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepwalkers-How-Europe-Went-1914/dp/0061146668)"
into World War I, China and America could blunder their way to disaster
today. ]{.underline}**

**[World War I is
often [considered](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepwalkers-How-Europe-Went-1914/dp/0061146668) the [classic](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-August-Pulitzer-Prize-Winning-Outbreak/dp/0345476093) example
of an unwanted war]{.underline}**: a devastating conflict that none of
the participants would have chosen had they known what was coming.
During the Cold War, U.S. policymakers worried that crises over Berlin
or Cuba could get out of control. There is a body
of [[political]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/Arms-Influence-Preface-Afterword-Lectures/dp/0300143370) [[science]{.underline}](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cs1J3h_28AUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=accidental+war&ots=Vfdc3HCKxi&sig=gh8pOSz58LDIvtAAUn--95sVb2E#v=onepage&q=accidental%20war&f=false) [[literature]{.underline}](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nveiS7HeqQUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=inadvertent+escalation&ots=GqOsJAq4dp&sig=6basMxSMJtCAc4RgaXD2dQzd4fM#v=onepage&q=inadvertent%20escalation&f=false) devoted
to understanding how accidental war can occur.

**[Yet]{.underline}** there is one big problem: **[[It is hard to

most notably
but [[not]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/July-1914-Countdown-Sean-McMeekin/dp/0465060749) solely
Austria-Hungary and Imperial Germany, **[[insisted]{.mark} on pursuing
[aggressive policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that [they knew
risked]{.mark}]{.underline}** a localized war at best and a
**[continental [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** at worst. **[They nearly
all [believed](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ISEC_a_00173#.VCBM_RYXOVo),
moreover, that if war had to come, better it should come sooner rather
than later.]{.underline}**

A generation after that, **[Franklin Roosevelt may not have foreseen
that slapping an oil embargo on Japan would lead to the aerial assault
on Pearl Harbor. But he certainly understood that war was a distinct
possibility]{.underline}** **[once the U.S. began strangling the economy
of a country that was already pillaging Asia.]{.underline}**

**[Likewise, the Six Day sWar]{.underline}** of 1967 **[is
sometimes [treated](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Avoiding_War/RMtmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=alexander+george+avoiding+war&dq=alexander+george+avoiding+war&printsec=frontcover) as]{.underline}**
an **[inadvertent]{.underline}** conflict. **[But again, Egyptian
leaders were hardly blind to
the [danger](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Six_Days_of_War/lEklDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=michael+oren+six+days+of+war&printsec=frontcover) of
war when they mobilized forces in the Sinai Peninsula, blockaded
Israel's port on the Red Sea and took other belligerent
steps. ]{.underline}**

The reality, as the historian Marc Trachtenberg
has [[shown]{.underline}](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/cv/inadvertent.pdf),
is that **[countries tend to avoid war when neither really desires it.
Yes, leaders do sometimes misjudge]{.underline}** how wars will turn out
and how destructive they will be. **[Tensions can gradually ratchet up
in a way that makes de-escalation progressively harder.]{.underline}**

**[Yet [there is no more monumental decision than]{.mark} to initiate a
[major conflict. So when countries really]{.mark} do [want to
avert]{.mark} a [showdown]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are generally willing
to [tack or retreat]{.mark}, even at the cost of some
embarrassment. ]{.underline}**

**[[During the Cold War]{.mark}, there was plenty of superpower
brinkmanship]{.underline}**, and some hair-raising incidents involving
U.S. and Soviet military forces. There
were [[several]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/We-Now-Know-Rethinking-Relations/dp/0198780710) near
misses in the Cuban Missile Crisis alone. **[But]{.underline}**
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that]{.underline}** case
**[and]{.underline}** **[[every]{.mark} other

defused]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and the superpowers drew back,
precisely]{.underline}** **[because]{.underline}** **[they didn't
believe that the stakes merited a nuclear bloodbath.]{.underline}**

**[Accidental war also seems unlikely today]{.underline}**. **[There are
plenty of circumstances in which [the U.S. and China could find

incident]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/02/world/us-plane-in-china-after-it-collides-with-chinese-jet.html) of

[[If arms control is needed]{.underline}]{.mark} in a strategic
relationship [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} in question [[might go to war, it will be
**impractical**]{.mark} for that very reason of
**need**]{.underline}---[whereas]{.underline}, [[if arms control should
prove]{.mark} to be [**available**, it will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[[be **irrelevant**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This has been called [the
**arms control paradox**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The record of the Cold
War shows that both the so-called status quo and revisionist powers,
[the US and]{.underline} the [Soviet Union]{.underline} respectively,
[were]{.underline} more or less [equally responsible for
reneging]{.underline} on their [arms control promises]{.underline}.

[Not only did both]{.underline} of them [attempt to **gain** nuclear
**superiority**]{.underline} during the Cold War despite a plethora of
arms control agreements, but [they were also equally responsible for
**encouraging prolif**]{.underline}eration. As the great powers try to
maximize their share of world power, [their **[interests
inevitably]{.mark}** come into [**conflict** with **arms
control**]{.mark}]{.underline} agreements, [making]{.underline} such
[[agreements **unravel**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While one can give some credit to arms control for maintaining strategic
stability and creating norms of behaviour, the fact remains that
[even]{.underline} one of [the **most in-depth agreements**
in]{.underline} terms of details of [provisions]{.underline},
[verification measures]{.underline}, and leading to regime
strengthening, the **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**omprehensive
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**est **[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**an
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, [[was rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}
by the US even when it faced no great power as a rival in the near term.
This is significant because [[if even]{.mark} one of [the
strongest]{.mark} arms control [measures is not]{.mark} deemed
[worthy]{.mark} of acceptance]{.underline}, then [[there is]{.mark}
**some [problem]{.mark}** [with **the** ]{.mark}**very [idea]{.mark}**
[of **arms control** rather than]{.mark} **[its]{.mark} specific
[provisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Indeed, [disenchantment with arms control has been growing since
the]{.underline} 19[80s]{.underline}. After a brief period of détente in
the 1970s, the two superpowers again started treating each other as
antagonists. [This affected **all**]{.underline} the **[arms
control]{.underline}** measures agreed to during détente. The signing of
a plethora of arms control agreements during détente was seen as a
success of arms control rather than a reflection of the relaxation of
tensions during détente. And so, when after détente, the superpowers
gave arms control short shrift, there was a lot of disappointment.

[[Major powers]{.underline}]{.mark} have **[always
[viewed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}
measures [[as a **by-product** of **underlying**]{.mark} **political
[realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is enough evidence to suggest
that [while great power [attempts]{.mark} at arms control [have **at
best** been]{.mark} quite **[useless]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} [have deftly used]{.underline} various [arms
control]{.underline} provisions [to **constrain**]{.underline} the
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}** [of **other states**]{.underline}
in the international system.

Realists in this regard are from Missouri, the "show me" state, and ask
utopians to explain how, why, and when a powerful new cooperative
international norm with corresponding international institutions will
become a reality. [[Realists point to]{.mark} **the unhappy history** of
the **unmet claims** and [**dashed hopes** of]{.mark} **the 1928
[Kellogg-Briand]{.mark} Pact**]{.underline} (intended to prevent
offensive war by global legal agreement), [**the [League of
Nations]{.mark}**[, and the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations. To be sure, the future does not have
to be bound by the past, but before moving further toward nuclear
disarmament, realists want to see some clear evidence of the emerging
transformation of the global order---not just the claim that it can
occur if all key leaders are so willing, faithful, and visionary and can
"embrace a politics of impossibility."12 As the old English proverb
says, ["If wishes were **horses**, then beggars would
**ride**."]{.underline}

But has not everything changed in the twenty-first century? Has not the
end of the Cold War ushered in a new global commitment to cooperation,
the rule of law globally, and benign conflict resolution? The unarguable
answer is no. **[Russian military [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[against **Georgia**]{.mark} **in 2008** [and **Ukraine**]{.mark}
**since 2014**]{.underline} (the latter in direct violation of the 1994
Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, Great Britain, and the United
States) [[are **sufficient**]{.mark} **empirical evidence** [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Thucydides']{.mark} **stark
description of [reality]{.mark}** [is **alive**]{.mark} **and well**.
[China's]{.mark} **expansionist [claims]{.mark}** and **military
pressure**]{.underline} against its neighbors in the East and South
China Seas [[teach the same lesson]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why is this reality significant in the consideration of nuclear weapons?
Because in the absence of reliably overturning the powerful norm of
raison d'État and Thucydides' explanation of international relations,
states with the capability and felt need will continue to demand nuclear
capabilities for their own protection and, in some cases, to provide
cover for their expansionist plans. To wit, if Ukraine had retained
nuclear weapons, would it now fear for its survival at the hands of
Russian aggression? Former Ukrainian defense minister Valeriy Heletey
and members of the Ukrainian parliament have made this point explicitly,
lamenting Ukraine's transfer of its nuclear forces to Russia in return
for now-broken security promises of the Budapest Memorandum.13

This lesson cannot have been lost on other leaders considering the value
of nuclear weapons. Nor is it a coincidence that US allies in Central
Europe and Asia are becoming ever more explicit about their need for US
nuclear assurances under the US extended nuclear deterrent (i.e., the
nuclear umbrella). They see no new emerging, powerful global collective
security regime or cooperative norms that will preserve their security;
thus, they understandably seek the assurance of power, including nuclear
power. The Polish Foreign Ministry observed in a recent press release
that "the current situation reaffirms the importance of NATO's nuclear
deterrence policy."14 This [[reality]{.mark} stands in **stark
[contrast]{.mark}** [to **utopian claims**]{.mark} that **powerful new
global [norms]{.mark}** and **international institutions** [will
**reorder** the]{.mark} international [system]{.mark}, **overturn**
Thucydides]{.underline}, and allow individual states to dispense with
nuclear weapons or the nuclear protection of a powerful ally. As the
Socialist French president Francois Hollande has said, "The
international context does not allow for any weakness. . . . The era of
nuclear deterrence is therefore not over. . . . In a dangerous
world---and it is dangerous---France does not want to let down its
guard. . . . The possibility of future state conflicts concerning us
directly or indirectly cannot be excluded."15 There could be no clearer
expression of Thucydides' description of international relations and its
contemporary implications for nuclear weapons.

Opponents of the administration's plan to modernize the US triad now
double down on the utopian narrative by insisting that the United States
instead lead the way in establishing the new global norm by showing that
Washington no longer relies on nuclear weapons and does not seek new
ones. Washington cannot expect others to forgo nuclear weapons if it
retains them, they say, and thus it must lead in creation of the new
norm against nuclear weapons by providing an example to the world. For
instance, "by unilaterally reducing its arsenal to a total of 1,000
warheads, the United States would encourage Russia to similarly reduce
its nuclear forces without waiting for arms control negotiations."16 A
good US example supposedly can help "induce parallel" behavior in
others.17 If, however, the United States attributes continuing value to
nuclear weapons by maintaining its arsenal, "other countries will be
more inclined to seek" them.18

Nuclear realists respond, however, that the United States already has
reduced its nuclear forces deeply over the last 25 years. America cut
its tactical nuclear weapons from a few thousand in 1991 to a "few
hundred" today.19 Moreover, US-deployed strategic nuclear weapons have
been cut from an estimated 9,000 in 1992 to roughly 1,600 accountable
warheads today, with still more reductions planned under the New START
Treaty.20 The United States has even decided to be highly revealing of
its nuclear capabilities to encourage others to do so, with no apparent
effect on Russia, China, or North Korea.21 America has adhered fully to
the reductions and restrictions of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty---the "centerpiece of arms control"---but the Russians now
are in open violation. As former undersec- retary of state Robert Joseph
stated recently, decades of deep US reductions "appear to have had no
moderating effect on Russian, Chinese or North Korean nuclear programs.
Neither have U.S. reductions led to any effective strengthening of
international nonproliferation efforts."22 [[Utopians want]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
lead]{.underline}]{.mark} the world toward nuclear disarmament
[[by]{.mark} **its good [example]{.mark}**[, but **no one** is
following]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[The]{.mark} basic [reason]{.mark}]{.underline}**, realists point
out, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**foreign [leaders]{.mark}** [make
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} about nuclear weaponry
[[based]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} their
countries' **[[strategic needs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, raison d'État,
[[not]{.mark} in **deference** to **[America's
penchant]{.mark}**]{.underline} for nuclear disarmament or some sense of
global fairness. A close review of India by S. Paul Kapur, for example,
concluded that "Indian leaders do not seek to emulate US nuclear
behavior; they formulate policy based primarily on their assessment of
the security threats facing India."23 The same self-interested
calculation is true for other nuclear and aspiring nuclear states.

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}ly [shooting]{.mark} at one
another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might end.]{.underline}**
Q: [Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No.
The U.S. has **not attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not
attacked** the U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely
likely at this point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of
[Russian]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is
there a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?
D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, the [U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a way that is
**proportional**]{.underline} [but **not escalatory.**]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark} what would lead to]{.underline}
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} direct
[combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [[Russians understand]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} **too [are vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also
quite likely that [with Russian forces already **overextended** fighting
against **Ukraine**, [Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second
major conflict** is not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q:
Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in
terms of the human toll and economics? Has Russia made resource and
allocation adjustments in the past months that will allow it to sustain
these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war efforts appear to be
unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of soldiers and expended
significant amounts of ammunition, such that commanders in the field are
complaining about shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have
to switch from offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of
people and materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth
is very slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but
there are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive]{.mark} in
2023.]{.underline}

Russian Assertiveness

The notion that a **[[major war]{.mark} among]{.underline}**
**[developed]{.underline}** **[countries [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[wildly unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[has]{.underline}**
**[frequently]{.underline}** **[been taken to have been challenged by
the]{.underline}** experience of the **[armed dispute
between]{.underline}** **[Russia and]{.underline}** neighboring
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** **[that began in 2014]{.underline}**. It
resulted in the peaceful, if extortionary, transfer of Crimea, a large
peninsular chunk of Ukraine, to Russia, and then in a sporadic, and
ultimately stalemated, civil war in Ukraine in which ethnic Russian
secessionist groups in a portion of Ukraine's east were supported by
Russia.

The fear, in particular, is that Russia's successful expansion --
justified, it says, in part by the desire to protect persecuted ethnic
Russians in a neighboring land -- will cause, or tempt, it to expand
elsewhere reflecting the manner in which Hitler expanded in order, he
said, to protect ethnic Germans from persecution particularly in areas
to his east. Indeed, NATO planners busily check roads in Western Europe
to see if they are suitable for military transport in the event that
Russia launches a full-scale invasion of the continent.50 And in 2018,
at the badgering of President Donald Trump, NATO countries all agreed to
increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product
by 2024, something he implied was a triumph although it merely
reaffirmed a commitment they had made at the time of the Crimean
takeover in 2014. 51

In the settlement that led to the unification of Germany in 1990, the
United States verbally promised that, although East Germany would now
become part of a NATO country, there would be no further expansion of
the alliance to the east.52 A few years later, however, NATO began just
such an expansion very much against many agitated concerns by
specialists. Among these was George Kennan who warned that "the Russians
will react quite adversely" and called the policy "a tragic mistake,"
pointing out that "there was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anyone else."53

The expansion was carried out with good intentions. and there were many
statements seeking to mollify Russian concerns including offering it a
sort of adjunct position in the alliance with the possible further
prospect of actual membership.54 Nevertheless, although the Russians
were powerless to stop the expansion, they greeted it with considerable
dismay and opposition, voiced not just by Communists and by
ultra-nationalists, but by very many in the Western-oriented elite. This
should have been a warning. But it wasn't. As Christopher Fettweis
observes, "In the 1990s, Russian protests regarding NATO expansion --
although nearly universal -- were not taken seriously, since U.S.
planners believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all."55

The situation was strained further in 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia, a
country with considerable historical links to Russia, securing the
secession of the Kosovo province as Russia stood by helplessly, a
development discussed in Chapter 3. Russia sometimes sees this as
precedent for its Crimean seizure.

As he was taking office as president of Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin
did tell a British interviewer, "Russia is part of European culture and
I can't imagine my country cut off from what we often refer to as the
'civilized world'."56 However, the strains from NATO expansion and from
the Kosovo experience were already in place, and they gradually
escalated in the new century as Putin's regime became increasingly
autocratic and as the United States, and particularly Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, together with its West European allies issued strong
support for anti-Putin protests that took place in Russia in 2011--12.
57

Russia's concern about NATO enlargement focused especially on the
possible Westernization of Ukraine, the large new country to its west
that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. One American observer
who had served in the Obama administration supplies an arresting
parallel: "The United States would hardly sit by idly if Russia formed
an alliance with Mexico and Canada and started building military
installations along the US border."58

Unlike the neighboring countries to its west in what had previously been
known as "East Europe," Ukraine, although fairly open and democratic,
had become a basket case economically despite an enormous potential. A
few statistics may serve. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,
Ukraine's per capita GDP was higher than Poland's; 25 years later, it
was less than onethird that of Poland.59 In a study comparing 25
post-Communist countries, Ukraine comes out dead last in economic
growth.60 Ukraine is now the poorest country in Europe.61

In this, it was like other, smaller counties that essentially lie
between Russia and Western Europe: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Belarus. These countries have been characterized not by
the substantial political liberalization and economic development that
has variously taken place in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Romania, and in
countries that emerged out of Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1991.
Rather, the "in-between" countries, led by the most important, Ukraine,
suffer from a set of what Samuel Charap and Timothy Colton call
"post-Soviet pathologies": dysfunctional governmental institutions,
economies lacking functioning markets, a rule of law that is weak or
absent, patronal politics, close links between political power and
control of major economic assets, and "pervasive corruption."62

In the case of Ukraine, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by outside
efforts from Russia and from Europe to influence the country. These have
made it easier for Ukraine to avoid desperately-needed reforms.63 Among
these are huge economic distortions concerning energy. The world average
for energy consumption per dollar of GDP is 10 British thermal units.
For the US it is 7.5, for the UK 3.8, for Ukraine 56.3. 64

Things came to a head when mass protests by Western-oriented Ukrainians
broke out in the capital city, Kiev. Their duly elected president, who
was perhaps even more corrupt than his equally duly elected
predecessors, had been juggling various opposing aid offers from the
West and from Russia. When he more or less accepted the (higher) Russian
bid, protests broke out, and these endured through the cold and snowy
winter of 2013--14 heightened by sporadic violence by security forces
and by elements within the protest movement, particularly those from the
highly anti-Russian far right.65

In February 2014, Ukraine's president fled to Russia abruptly leaving
the extravagant private zoo he had created behind.66 In the subsequent
chaos, parliament removed provisions that had previously allowed the use
of Russian as an official language under some conditions.67

Largely ignored in these development were the interests of Russian
speakers in the country, some 30 percent of the population, who are
concentrated in the east and south and were decidedly unsympathetic to
the Kiev protests.68 This was particularly the case in the large Crimea
peninsula to the south where Russia, by an agreement brokered when the
Soviet Union split up in 1991, maintains a substantial naval base for
its Black Sea Fleet. Putin was alarmed at the developments in Kiev where
anti-Russian ideologues now occupied one-third of the cabinet seats. He
was also deeply concerned that the new government might abrogate or fail
to renew the lease on the naval base, seen to be vital national asset.69
And he was doubtless miffed that Western leaders had boycotted the
winter Olympics he had hosted a few months earlier.70

He bolstered troop strength at the naval base, and soon men in green
uniforms without insignia (known as "little green men") were fanning out
in Crimea occupying military and government facilities.71 Crimean
Russians often felt neglected over the years by government in Kiev, and
they feared after the fall of the president that they would be violently
persecuted.72 The local Crimean authorities organized a referendum on
secession and on March 16, 2014, a vote, boycotted by many, was held in
which 97 percent of those who voted supposedly supported leaving Ukraine
and joining Russia. Backed enthusiastically by his parliament and by the
citizenry of Russia, Putin graciously accepted the request.

Meanwhile, in Donbas -- areas abutting Russia in eastern Ukraine --
local Russians, emboldened by the events in Crimea, organized a
secession movement, setting up their own ad hoc governments. Ukrainian
armed forces, led initially mainly by volunteer paramilitaries, were
sent to put them down.73 Aided by infiltrators from Russia, the
secessionists were able to hold them to a stalemate. Over 10,000 were
killed in the violence.74

Ukraine cut off financial subsidies, electricity, and water supplies to
Crimea, and tourism, an important Crimean industry, dropped
precipitously. But Russia, at considerable cost, worked to alleviate
these problems, and in 2018 a 12-mile \$3 billion bridge -- the contract
went to one of Putin's buddies, a former judo partner -- had been
constructed to link Crimea with Russia, a country that, otherwise, ranks
ninety-fourth in the world in infrastructure. Putin drove the first
truck across the span himself.75 Efforts to integrate Crimea into Russia
have been extensive, and Russian retirees (especially military ones) are
encouraged to move there even as those opposed to the Russian takeover
often emigrate to Ukraine.

If the goal of Russia was to keep Ukraine from seeking to embrace the
West while, in Robert Person's words, "establishing a pliant pro-Russian
regime in Kiev," its efforts failed miserably.76 As one observer
predicted at the time, "Far from dissuading Ukrainians from seeking a
future in Europe, Moscow's moves will only foster a greater sense of
nationalism in all parts of the country and turn Ukrainian elites
against Russia, probably for a generation."77 Or as Daniel Treisman
observed in the aftermath, "If Putin's goal was to prevent Russia's
military encirclement, his aggression in Ukraine has been a tremendous
failure, since it has produced the exact opposite."78

In addition, [**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[experience
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [2014]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}**
and crisis in Ukraine **[[suggests]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
**[countries cannot engage in]{.underline}** such **[enterprises
without]{.underline}** **[[automatic]{.mark}ally]{.underline}**
**[paying a substantial]{.underline}** **[economic price -- it is
something like an]{.underline}** **[[economic doomsday]{.mark}
machine]{.underline}**. Because of its antics, **[Russia suffered a
[decline in]{.mark} the]{.underline}** [**[value]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its [currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[capital flight]{.underline}**, **[a drop in its]{.underline}**
[**[stock market]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
decline in]{.underline}** **[foreign [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
And, perhaps most importantly, **[there was a]{.underline}** **[very
substantial drop]{.underline}** **[in confidence by investors, buyers,
and sellers]{.underline}** throughout the world, a condition that is
likely to last for years, even decades.79 As Charap and Colton stress,
"Moscow is at serious risk of permanently alienating the entire EU,
which as a bloc has long been Russia's largest trading partner and
direct investor."80 One prominent British observer puts it even more
starkly, suggesting that the events "mark the end of an era, the end of
the hope that Russia could be incorporated into a united and peaceful
Europe."81 As part of this, Russia's behavior has set off a determined
effort by Europeans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy
supplies -- a change that could be permanent. And **[the]{.underline}**
**[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of]{.underline}** the conflict and
of supporting its new distant dependencies **[have been visited by
Russia on itself]{.underline}**. Crimea was less well off economically
than most of Ukraine and required subsidies from Kiev.82 And the Donbas
region was heavily subsidized by Ukraine as well.83 These
**[burdens]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** now **[[shifted
to]{.mark} Russia]{.underline}**.

**[There have been]{.underline}** other **[economic costs]{.underline}**
as well. Economic **[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been
**[visited on Russia]{.underline}** **[by other states]{.underline}**.
Although especially costly to Europe, they were embraced after rebels in
eastern Ukraine (perhaps accidentally) shot down a civilian airliner
with a missile presumably supplied by Russia.84 Unrelated to the crisis,
there was a severe drop in prices for oil on the international market, a
development that is especially harmful to Russia: for every decline of
\$25 in the price of oil, Russia experiences a nearly 2 percent decline
in GNP, and oil and gas sales fund about 36 percent of the Russian
annual budget. The economic pain inflicted by the oil price drop has
been much greater -- perhaps four times greater -- than that of the
sanctions.85

There is **[likely]{.underline}** as well **[to be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[special political cost for
Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Since he came to power in 2000, there has
been a steady improvement in Russia each year in GDP per capita. That
process was reversed in 2014. From 2014--17, real disposable income fell
by 15 percent.86 Aspirational purchases as for homes and cars have
shifted to ones devoted to daily needs.87 And Russia's Stabilization
Fund, built up when oil prices were high and meant to fund pension
payments and to support the ruble, was significantly depleted and may
run out of money entirely. Over time, **[some]{.underline}** may **[see
this as a]{.underline}** [**[break]{.underline}** **[with his promise
to]{.underline}** **[provide]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the]{.underline}** **[[stability]{.mark} and order]{.underline}**
**[necessary to allow economic progress]{.underline}** to take place.88

The **[developments in Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014
**[were]{.underline}** **[unsettling]{.underline}**, of course. However,
**[it is]{.underline}** **[impressive]{.underline}** that **[the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** Western
[**[Europe]{.underline}** **[never]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even [came
close to]{.mark} seriously considering [the use of]{.mark} direct
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deal with the issue. Although the
crisis created, as Steven Pinker notes, "just the kinds of tensions that
in the past had led to great-power wars," nothing like that took
place.89 In fact, **[the West behaved in much]{.underline}** **[the same
way it would have]{.underline}** behaved **[if it had]{.underline}**
**[not possessed]{.underline}** **[a great and expensive]{.underline}**
**[military capacity]{.underline}**. Indeed, President Barack Obama, who
presided over the episode, was given to taunting his hawkish critics:
"Now, if there is somebody in this town that would claim that we would
consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, they
should speak up and be very clear about it."90

The **[events]{.underline}** **[inspired concerns]{.underline}** that
**[Putin had or has wider intentions]{.underline}**.91 The
**[natural]{.underline}** **[next step]{.underline}**, suggest some,
**[would be some sort of invasion of the]{.underline}** **[Baltic
states]{.underline}** of Latvia, Lithuania, and/or Estonia.
**[Each]{.underline}**, like Ukraine, **[has a Russian
minority]{.underline}** which, in many cases, has not blended in well
with the majority culture and might even consider itself to be
persecuted.

West Point's Robert Person has **[looked at]{.underline}** the
**[parallels]{.underline}** **[and finds them wanting]{.underline}**.92
To begin with, **[[Ukraine has]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Person calls
"**[a]{.underline}** **[deep [symbolic meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[for Russia]{.underline}**." It had been part of the Russian empire
since the sixteenth century and is often considered to be "the cradle of
eastern Slavic civilization." Moreover, Crimea did not become part of
Ukraine until it was "gifted" to that Soviet republic in 1954 by Nikita
Khrushchev in a process that was quixotic and arbitrary and never
actually made official even by the regulations of Soviet or Communist
law.93 And, of course, Crimea's Russian naval base added special
significance. **[By contrast]{.underline}**, continues Person,
**[Latvia]{.underline}**, **[Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Estonia]{.underline}**, unlike Ukraine, **[have frequently enjoyed
an]{.underline}** **[independent status]{.underline}**, **[and
[Russians]{.mark} "have]{.underline}** **[[long
recognized]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[the [Baltics
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[culturally and historically
[different]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[from Russia]{.underline}**."
Moreover, **[Russians]{.underline}** **[in the Baltics]{.underline}**
**[[do not]{.mark} seem to [have]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[separatist]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** not least in part **[because they
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** much **[[higher standards]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}** do their **[counterparts
o]{.underline}**n **[the other side of the border]{.underline}**. And
**[because the Baltic states are members of the]{.underline}**
**[European Union]{.underline}** **[and its associated]{.underline}**
**[Schengen zon]{.underline}**e, **[their citizens would no
longer]{.underline}** **[enjoy the]{.underline}** associated **[ease of
travel to the continent]{.underline}** if they became part of Russia.94

In all, then, **[the]{.underline}** **[[notion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[that [Putin]{.mark}'s Russia [is on an]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[expansionary mission]{.underline}**]{.mark}, so commonly voiced at
the time of the 2014 events, **[seems to]{.underline}** **[[have little
substance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.95 It has **[[not]{.mark} even [sought
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[officially annex]{.underline}**
**[separatist areas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. A special issue of the journal Daedalus,
published in 2017, ran a series of essays dealing with Russia's future.
None envisioned territorial expansion.96

Definitions of superpower status common during the Cold War generally
stressed the possession of stocks of nuclear weapons. If that criterion
continued to be embraced, Russia should still probably be considered a
superpower. However, as Dmitri Trenin points out, **[Russia
"[has]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[few]{.mark} formal
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[no satellite states]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} \... **[[no]{.mark}
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}** to compare with the comprehensive dogma
of Marxism-Leninism." Moreover, "although it is still a nuclear
superpower, **[it [lags]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[far]{.underline}**
**[behind the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates in
non-nuclear [military]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Economically, Russia]{.underline}**
-- with its estimated 1.5 percent of the global gross domestic product
-- **[is a dwarf]{.underline}**."97 Its GDP ranks twelfth in the world,
but is only one-fifteenth that of the United States and about half that
of California. Moreover, GDP growth in Russia has been weak with recent
figures at about 1.8 percent per year, and it relies heavily on selling
energy abroad: nearly 50 percent of its exports are in oil and gas. Its
**[[population]{.mark} is]{.underline}**
**[[shrinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** and may, according to medium-term
projections, be reduced to 125 million by 2094 from the current level of
about 148 million. **[For an economy that is]{.underline}** **[more
people-intensive]{.underline}** **[than other advanced economies,
[this]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[spells trouble]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
As Barack Obama pointed out derisively, if undiplomatically, in his
final news conference as president, "Their **[economy doesn't
produce]{.underline}** **[anything that anybody wants]{.underline}**
**[to buy]{.underline}**, except oil and gas and arms. They don't
innovate."98

The (rather **[bizarre) Russia suffers from]{.underline}** the same
problems as the "in-between" counties as discussed above while
**[being]{.underline}** **[[burdened]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition
**[[by a]{.mark} much larger military budget -- although]{.underline}**
**[[weak]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** also **[been reflected [in
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[shrinking]{.underline}**
**[military]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[budget]{.underline}**, down about
5 percent in 2018 from 2017. Like China, it has **[devolved into a form
of]{.underline}** **[crony capitalism]{.underline}**
**[where]{.underline}** **[[property rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[are [insecure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[capital
[flight]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is [common]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[is
[rampant]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[economic [stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Anders Aslund concludes, the state
has been captured by a small group of top officials with the topmost
being Vladimir Putin, who has 20 palaces, four yachts, 58 aircraft, and
a collection of watches worth \$600,000. 99

**[[Ukraine]{.mark} episode]{.underline}** of 2014
**[[seems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the Korean invasion of 1950,
**[to]{.underline}** **[be [a one-off]{.mark} -- a]{.underline}**
**[unique]{.underline}**, **[opportunistic]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** probably **[under-considered]{.underline}**
**[escapade that]{.underline}** **[proved to be unexpectedly costly to
the perpetrators]{.underline}**. As with the Korean case, **[massive
[extrapolation is]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[unjustified and
[ill-advised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, the Ukrainian venture,
contrary to much initial speculation, does not seem to be a
game-changer.100

As Trenin points out, **[Moscow's]{.underline}** **[most important
objective]{.underline}** **[is to reassert its role as a]{.underline}**
**[great power]{.underline}** **[with a global reach]{.underline}**.
However, **[it does]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}** **[seek to
impose its own model on]{.underline}** **[the world]{.underline}**. In
all this, [**[neither side]{.underline}** **[envisions
a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[real [shooting war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[against its adversary]{.underline}** **[and neither
wants]{.underline}** to allow **[the situation to become]{.underline}**
**[uncontrollable]{.underline}**.101
