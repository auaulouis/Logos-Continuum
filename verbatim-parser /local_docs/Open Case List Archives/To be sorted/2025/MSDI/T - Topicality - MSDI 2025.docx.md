The NCLAT took note of the observations of the Adjudicating Authority in
the order under challenge wherein the provision relating to moratorium
under section 14 was discussed and clarified as to which property is to
be attached while passing order for initiation of moratorium. The
relevant portion of the Order of the Adjudicating Authority is
reproduced hereunder:

\"8.1. On careful reading I have noticed that [the term \"its\" is
significant]{.underline}. The plain language of the Section is that on

declared for]{.underline} prohibiting any action to recover or enforce
[any security interest created by the Corporate Debtor in respect of
\"its\" property.]{.underline} Relevant section which needs in-depth
examination is Section 14 (1) (c) of The Code. There are recognized
canons of interpretation. [Language of the Statute should be read as it
existed.]{.underline} This is a trite law that [no word can be added or
substituted or deleted]{.underline} from the enacted Code duly

#### The plan violates -- it's not exclusive to the USFG because it fiats cooperation with oil companies who would do the drilling.

#### Standards:

#### A. Limits -- it explodes the limits of the topic to an unlimited number of private actors.

#### B. Ground -- Changing the actor to non-state actors destroys disad links and counterplan ground. Only a USFG actor doing the plan can solve.

#### C. Burden -- winning that the Aff is not an example of the resolution demonstrates a failure to meet their fundamental burden of proof, calling for an automatic Neg ballot.

#### Voters:

#### A. Education -- Without limits on the topic and adequate neg ground, we cannot have in-depth discussions and learn about the topic. Debate is valuable for the education we gain. This is a voting issue.

#### B. Fairness -- for the affirmative to win, they must play by the rules. One of the burdens of the affirmative is to be under the topic. The negative team is prepared for the topic, anything else is unfair and is a voting issue.

### 1NC "Arctic" vs. Early-Warning Systems

#### Interpretation -- "The Arctic" is only the US territories. Expanding beyond that is extra-topical, which is a voting issue for overstretching limits and presenting a moral hazard in the 1NC.

**USCS '25** \[United States Code Servic//23/2025, "Definitions,"
*United States Code Service*, Title 49: Transportation, Subtitle VII:
Aviation Programs, Part A: Air Commerce and Safety, Subpart III: Safety,
Chapter 448: Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Lexis\]

§ 44801. Definitions

In this chapter \[49 USCS §§ 44801 et seq.\], the [[following
**definitions** apply]{.underline}]{.mark}:

(1) Actively tethered unmanned aircraft system. The term "actively
tethered unmanned aircraft system" means an unmanned aircraft system in
which the unmanned aircraft component---

(A) weighs 55 pounds or less, including payload but not including the
tether;

(B) is physically attached to a ground station with a taut,
appropriately load-rated tether that provides continuous power to the
unmanned aircraft and is unlikely to be separated from the unmanned
aircraft;

(C) is controlled and retrieved by such ground station through physical
manipulation of the tether;

(D) is able to maintain safe flight control in the event of a power or
flight control failure during flight; and

(E) is programmed to initiate a controlled landing in the event of a
tether separation.

(2) Appropriate committees of Congress. The term "appropriate committees
of Congress" means the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

[(3) Arctic. [The term "**Arctic**" means the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[zone
of the **Chukchi Sea**, **Beaufort Sea**, and **Bering Sea**]{.mark}
north of the Aleutian chain]{.underline}.

#### The plan violates -- it's not exclusive to the US Arctic territory because it launches satellites into orbit and submarines into extra-territorial waters.

#### Standards:

#### A. Limits -- it explodes the limits of the topic to an unlimited space beyond the Arctic that is only tangentially related to the Arctic. Allows an unlimited number of extra-T affs.

#### B. Ground -- Action outside the Arctic destroys disad links and counterplan ground.

#### C. Burden -- winning that the Aff is not an example of the resolution demonstrates a failure to meet their fundamental burden of proof, calling for an automatic Neg ballot.

#### Voters:

#### A. Education -- Without limits on the topic and adequate neg ground, we cannot have in-depth discussions and learn about the topic. Debate is valuable for the education we gain. This is a voting issue.

#### B. Fairness -- for the affirmative to win, they must play by the rules. One of the burdens of the affirmative is to be under the topic. The negative team is prepared for the topic, anything else is unfair and is a voting issue.

### 1NC "Exploration" vs. Science Diplomacy

#### Interpretation -- Arctic exploration and development is direct government facilitation of resource extraction projects.

**McGuire '15** \[Lesil and Bob Herron; January 30; J.D., State Senator
from Alaska; State Representative from Alaska; Alaska Arctic Policy
Commission, chaired by Lesil and McGuire, established by the Alaska
State Legislature to "develop an Arctic policy for the state and produce
a strategy for the implementation of an Arctic policy; "Final Report of
the Alaska Arctic Policy Commission,"
https://www.uaf.edu/caps/resources/state-of-alaska-policy-documents/aapc-final-report-2015.pdf\]

The vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves make the Alaskan Arctic
attractive for investment. However, [[**development** is
**challenged**]{.underline} [by **distance to markets**]{.underline},
**[limited infrastructure]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [costs and risks
attendant to its remoteness, challenging]{.underline}

[weather and environmental conditions and a dwindling subfreezing
season]{.underline} necessary for maintaining ice roads and conditions
suitable for safe travel and operation within the Arctic.4 [[Despite
this]{.underline}]{.mark} challenging environment,
[**[exploration]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[development]{.underline}** [investment in the **Arctic**]{.underline}
[has steadily **increased**]{.underline}]{.mark} and will continue to do
so if commodity prices remain high and Alaska remains competitive for
investment dollars.5 Alaska is in a global race to attract investment
that will open new opportunities in the Arctic.

[To encourage new capital investment and secure the benefits of new
resource development]{.underline} upon which state and local communities
depend, [Alaska and its [federal counterparts must continue to spearhead
new strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} to keep Alaska competitive. [The
state has some of the most sophisticated interagency coordination and
permitting processes in the country, with the expertise]{.underline},
experience and commitment to safely develop the Alaskan Arctic's vast
resources. With this history and experience, Alaska is well-positioned
to respond to increased resource development activity in the Arctic.

Some Alaskan Arctic communities are currently supporting **[[new
resource extraction projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These communities
recognize that oil, gas and mining industries offer meaningful
employment, stable cash economies and reliable municipal revenues that
support clean water, sanitation, health clinics, airports and other
infrastructure necessary for strong, safe and healthy communities. While
circumstances differ among local governments, resource development
projects often generate an influx of new revenue sources. This new
revenue has, in many cases, afforded local governments the resources to
expand emergency response and search and rescue capabilities, take an
active role in oil spill preparedness and implement meaningful measures
to protect regional ecosystems and local food sources that are critical
to a subsistence culture. Resource development also holds the potential
to increase access to affordable energy in remote communities with
staggering energy costs.

[It is imperative to **balance** new **resource
development**]{.underline} opportunities -- both on- and offshore --
[with **safeguards** that consider]{.underline} possible environmental
impacts. Although debate of potential risks to the environment and
impact on subsistence resources is contentious, dialogue that addresses
these issues is constructive and solution-oriented. This discourse
includes ensuring that rural development includes protections for
subsistence resources, cultural identity and lands, while providing
needed infrastructure, services and employment training opportunities.

[[Emerging resource development opportunities]{.mark}, newly accessible
[**maritime routes** and **public investment**]{.mark} in construction
and infrastructure [will create an increased deman]{.mark}d]{.underline}
for educational resources and skilled workforces. The state university
system, with industry and nonprofit partners, is actively engaged in
delivering quality training and meeting the needs of a future workforce.

#### The plan violates -- it cooperates over climate change, conservation, and biodiversity. These goals are distinct from resource extraction! 

#### Standards:

#### A. Limits -- Only exploration of natural resources is the best limit on the topic. They lead to the explosion of ANYTHING in the Arctic.

#### B. Ground -- Our links are predicated on resource extraction. Any other form of exploration destroys predictable neg ground.

#### C. Burden -- winning that the Aff is not an example of the resolution demonstrates a failure to meet their fundamental burden of proof, calling for an automatic Neg ballot.

#### Voters:

#### A. Education -- Without limits on the topic and adequate neg ground, we cannot have in-depth discussions and learn about the topic. Debate is valuable for the education we gain. This is a voting issue.

#### B. Fairness -- for the affirmative to win, they must play by the rules. One of the burdens of the affirmative is to be under the topic. The negative team is prepared for the topic, anything else is unfair and is a voting issue.

The Strategy's Ways and Means

To deter Russia and China from threatening U.S. interests in the Arctic,
the U.S. military needs to demonstrate presence in the region beyond
submarines. Submarines can deter large-scale attacks but are less useful
against coercion and intimidation. Deterring Russia will require Navy
surface assets (manned and unmanned) and a more robust air and ground
presence in the European and North Atlantic Arctic. It is difficult to
police fisheries, monitor potentially hostile surface ships, or target
airborne intruders without capabilities in the region. As Adm. James
Foggo said of the Arctic when commanding Allied Joint Forces Command in
Italy, "In order to deter, you have to be present. You've got to be
there and you've got to be there quickly." Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander
of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, made similar remarks in late April 2021.

#### 3. Prefer our interpretation -- standards:

#### A. Limits -- Most government action is contracted and done by private or local entities. Their definition of only direct federal action is over-limiting.

#### B. Ground -- regulations, cooperation, and funding are important affirmative ground. The negative's interpretation destroys affirmative ground and does not garner good negative ground either.

#### 4. Voters:

#### A. Education -- nearly any affirmative is going to be broad government action. This is the most reasonable and educational definition of the topic.

#### B. Literature checks limits and ground loss -- affirmatives have to have a solvency advocate based in the topic literature.

#### C. Reasonability -- Our interpretation is reasonable. Competing interpretations leads to race to the smallest, most neg-biased topic.

### 2AC Renewables vs. "Its"

#### 1. We meet -- Funding and approval make private science 'federal' 

Korey **Silverman-Roati &** Romany M. **Webb,** 20**24** - Sabin Center
for Climate Change Law. "Removing Methane via Soil Amendments: The Legal
Framework,"(2024). Available at:
https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/238

As noted above, under NEPA, federal agencies are only required to
prepare an EIS for "major federal actions significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." For the purposes of NEPA[, [federal
actions include "projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and programs [entirely or
[partly financed]{.mark}]{.underline}, assisted, conducted, regulated,
[[or]{.underline} [approved by Federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}."121 Thus, where a federal agency proposes
to undertake a soil amendment project, that would qualify as a "federal
action" under NEPA. Soil amendment [[projects]{.mark} proposed
[by]{.mark} non-federal actors (e.g., [private
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} or companies) might also [[qualify if
the projects are funded, approved]{.mark}, or otherwise regulated [by a
federal agency]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the latter case,
however, [[the project will]{.mark} only [be considered a federal
action]{.mark}]{.underline} under NEPA [[if]{.mark} it is "[subject to
Federal control]{.mark} and responsibility]{.underline}."122 As
discussed in Part 4.1.4 below, many privately developed soil amendment
projects will likely require federal permits and thus be subject to
federal control.

Marcy: [When we say [the **Arctic**]{.mark}, we're]{.underline} usually
[[refer]{.mark}ring [to the **area within the Arctic

land**]{.mark}]{.underline} that belong to the United States, Canada,
Denmark's Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. These
eight countries are sometimes called the Arctic Eight. The only area of
the Arctic that doesn't belong to the Arctic Eight is a mostly frozen
area called the central Arctic ocean. So when China announced the Arctic
as one of its "new strategic frontiers", it ruffled some feathers.

#### 3. Prefer our interpretation -- standards:

#### A. Limits -- Exploration can happen from any vantage point, as long as the exploration is in the Arctic. They overlimit to land-based exploration and are missing key data points necessary for exploration.

#### B. Ground -- Satellite, sensors, drones, etc. are important affirmative ground for exploration. Links are based on exploration of the Artic, not just in the Arctic, which means we don't hurt negative ground. 

#### 4. Voters:

#### A. Education -- Exploration must be of the Artic, not the vantage point. This is the most reasonable and educational definition of the topic.

[[Exploration might be]{.mark} an act of [discovering an **unexplored
place** **or**]{.mark} discovering [**an unfamiliar subject**; in
both]{.mark} cases, **[an "unknown" is required]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
John Franklin sought to sail through an unknown passage; Robert Peary
and Frederick Cook tried to reach the mythic North Pole. Explorers made
the imaginary Thule real.

Depending on the era of exploration, [the principal actors in the Arctic
have changed]{.underline} over the centuries. Until the start of the
twenty-first century, traditional "explorers" acted in the Arctic.
Compared to the explorations in the previous centuries, [[contemporary
efforts to explore the Arctic originate from **oil**]{.mark} and gas
[**companies** and **scientists**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} employ different methods and techniques and
[[have different motives for exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Consequently, [[as the "unknown" elements of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved and
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark}, so has [[the "subject" of exploration
transformed as well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Previous explorations leading up to the twenty-first century certainly
increased the geopolitical importance of the Arctic, as nations
developed new fishing grounds and new shipping routes. Subsequent
colonization of parts of the Arctic (Russian rule in Alaska, the Hudson
Bay Company in Canada, and the Bergen Greenland Company of Norway and
Denmark) paved the way for additional economic activities, such as fur
trading (Norman, 2018: 2).

Early economic and scientific explorations were financed by states
primarily to promote their interests in expanding their reach in the
areas of the Arctic considered terra nullius. Since then, the increasing
pressure of globalization on the nation-state system in the twenty-first
century promoted new actors in Arctic exploration, such as IGOs
(intergovernmental organizations), NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), private companies and multinational investors. Indeed,
the term "explorer" today is largely used as a metaphor, since the type
of exploration has evolved from discovering unknown territory to
developing new economic activities, such as the exploration of oil and
gas deposits by companies. In such cases, the new explorers are
companies.

[[Climate change has become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[the most
important]{.mark} [motive]{.mark}s [for scientific
exploration]{.mark},]{.underline} as we seek to understand the causes
and impacts of the warming Arctic[. [These explorations
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[financed by
states]{.underline}]{.mark} but also by NGOs, private companies or
international organizations. Scientists, Indigenous peoples and other
Arctic residents also take part in these projects.

#### 3. Prefer our interpretation -- standards:

#### A. Limits -- Over-limiting the topic to only extraction of resources without the preservation of resources misunderstands the exploration of the Arctic.

#### B. Ground -- Environment and climate exploration are important affirmative ground. The negative's interpretation destroys affirmative ground and does not garner good negative ground either.

#### 4. Voters:

#### A. Education -- Understanding climate and environmental exploration is the most applicable to Arctic exploration. This is the most reasonable and educational definition of the topic.

#### B. Literature checks limits and ground loss -- affirmatives have to have a solvency advocate based in the topic literature.

#### C. Reasonability -- Our interpretation is reasonable. Competing interpretations leads to race to the smallest, most neg-biased topic.

Versus Production Mining\", An Underground Miner,
<https://anundergroundminer.com/blog/underground-development-mining-versus-production-mining>,
accessed 5/25/25, mw

Mining is a sophisticated process that requires high-level skills. You
must have the relevant skills on how to go underground until you reach
the relevant ore body.

It is necessary to follow specific steps to ensure the process is safe
and does not contravene any laws.

The main two steps in mining are development mining and production
mining. [[Development mining mainly involves removing unwanted
substances, also known as overburden, on top of the targeted
ore.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Production mining]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[involves
the removal of the targeted minerals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[This is the most critical aspect of mining]{.underline}]{.mark}
because it allows the minerals lying underground to be removed.

Consequently, it needs more care and accuracy to avoid damaging the ore
body or causing any accidents.

Development Mining

This mining step can also be regarded as the step that creates a path
for targeted ore to be excavated.

The process mainly depends on how deep the minerals are from the
surface.

It also depends on the kind of materials being removed. Some
non-valuable materials such as hard rock might be more challenging to
excavate than sedimentary or soft rock materials.

To enhance safety and organization [[in development
mining]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are **[[several steps you must
follow]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Each step has its importance because skipping one of the steps might
result in catastrophes.

The steps are arranged in order of which you should start with to the
one you should do last.

[[1. Removal of blasted materials]{.underline}]{.mark}

This step\'s importance is to create an organized working environment
with no dangerous or hindering components left in the mining area.

The materials removed or \'mucked\' are mainly the non-valuable
materials that were left behind in a previous drill and blast cycle.

[[2. Scaling]{.underline}]{.mark}

This step involves **removing unstable rocks** or slabs that might be
hanging from the sidewalls or the roof (also known as the back).

These hanging rocks and slabs can put the worker and equipment in danger
of being crushed.

The removal process needs to be done systematically to avoid making the
mining path unstable.

[[3. Reinforcement and support installation]{.underline}]{.mark}

After the scaling is complete, the **next step is ground control**. This
involves installing support and/ or reinforcement.

This could be either shotcrete, rock bolts, wire mesh, or a mixture of
all three, dependent on the ground type.

The importance of this is that even if the **rock seems stable**, it can
be affected by mining activities.

Ensuring that the mining path is **well reinforced and
supported** enhances safety for anyone underground during the mining
process.

[[4. Drilling of the Face]{.underline}]{.mark}

The non-valuable materials removed in development mining are
disintegrated and removed through blasting.

The explosive used needs to be placed in strategic locations in the
face.

It is necessary to **drill the rock strategically** to create space for
both the placement of explosives and for the rock to implode inwards to
create the tunnel profile.

Having the right drill is very important in this phase to ensure safety
and productivity.

[[5. Explosives loading or Charging]{.underline}]{.mark}

After drilling holes in the face, you then need to **place the
explosives carefully**.

It is essential to ensure that the explosives have the necessary power
to disintegrate the rock and other non-valuable materials effectively.

**Safety** is of the utmost importance while charging to avoid
unnecessary accidents.

[[6. Blasting]{.underline}]{.mark}

The sixth step in development mining is** blasting the explosive**. You
should ensure that all the safety attributes are observed while blasting
the explosives.

Remote-controlled detonation is used to ensure that all workers are at a
safe distance where they cannot be hurt by the fly rock or other objects
during the explosion.

**Britannica '25** \[Britannica. July 4, 2025. Britannica "Arctic"

[[**Arctic**, northernmost region of **Earth**]{.mark}, centred on the
North Pole]{.underline} and characterized by distinctively polar
conditions of climate, plant and animal life, and other physical
features. The term is derived from the Greek arktos ("bear"), referring
to the northern constellation of the Bear. It has sometimes been used to
designate the area within the Arctic Circle---a mathematical line that
is drawn at latitude 66°30′ N, marking the southern limit of the zone in
which there is at least one annual period of 24 hours during which the
sun does not set and one during which it does not rise. This line,
however, is without value as a geographic boundary, since it is not
keyed to the nature of the terrain.

In addition to the International Maritime Organization definition of the
Arctic, various Arctic Council bodies have established differing
definitions for the Arctic. The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental
forum that promotes the cooperation, coordination and interaction among
the Arctic States, Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic
inhabitants on common Arctic issues. [[The definitions of the Arctic
developed by various Arctic Council groups]{.underline}]{.mark} vary
based on criteria that are relevant to each body's respective concerns.
For example, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) has
established a definition of the Arctic that [[incorporates numerous
considerations including the Arctic Circle, political boundaries,
vegetation boundaries, permafrost limits, and major oceanographic
features]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[2\] With these criteria in mind, the
[[Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark} covered by AMAP [[includes
terrestrial and marine areas north of the Arctic Circle (66°32'N), and
north of 62°N in Asia and 60°N in North America]{.underline}]{.mark},
modified to include the marine areas north of the Aleutian chain, Hudson
Bay, and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean including the Labrador Sea.

### Regional Development

***Since the resolution reads as "development of \[region\]" it might be
worth considering interpretations of "regional development" like seen
below.***

#### Regional development is to develop socio-economically to deal with a problem within the region.

People and Technology at Roskilde University; MA, geography and history;
PhD, geography; PhD, scientific sociology in social science. 2009.
*International Encyclopedia of Human Geography* "Regional Development
and Noneconomic Factors"
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/regional-development>
// ***mosuQ***\]

What Is Noneconomic in Regional Development?

[[**Regional development** is the label of the **efforts to develop
certain areas**]{.mark} of a country, with development [usually
understood in the **socioeconomic sense**]{.mark}. Regional development
is thus not only measured in incomes, the number of jobs, and
demographic trends in a certain area, but it can also point to the more
general dynamics such as innovation and creativity in the region in
focus]{.underline}. The definition of the region in question has not
always been explicit, but when it becomes explicit, it becomes clear how
regional development is connected to the making of territorial states.
In the Keynesian welfare state, regional development was associated with
regional policies aiming to overcome uneven development between
different regions of the territorial state. This means that regional
development was, and in some contexts still is, seen as a marker for the
effort to overcome imbalances and unevenness within the territory of a
state. In this more precise sense, regions are defined by being
part-of-whole in relation to the state, and [regional development is
[the **agenda of regional policies in order to deal with a 'regional
problem'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the more Schumpeterian regimes,
regional development has increasingly been seen as a process of
innovation and entrepreneurship, aiming at growth in any region more
than the explicit contribution to the solution of the particular
'regional problem'. Here, regional development is often associated with
the growth and innovation of private business in a particular region,
which in turn is rather loosely defined as the 'container' of
socioeconomic activity.

### Duty

#### Should means duty.

**Random House Dictionary**, 20**10** (© Random House, Inc. 2010)

**[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}**; ought (**[[used to indicate
duty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, propriety, or expediency

#### This interpretation is the most predictable.

**Random House Dictionary**, 20**10** (Random House, Inc., online)

Rules similar to those for choosing between shall and will have long
been advanced for should and would, but again the rules have had little
effect on usage. In most constructions, **[[would is the auxiliary
chosen regardless of the]{.underline}]{.mark}** person of the
**[[subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**: If our allies would support the
move, we would abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised
at the complexity of the directions. Because **[[the main function of
should]{.underline}]{.mark}** in modern American English **[[is to
express duty, necessity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, etc. (You should get
your flu shot before winter comes), its use for other purposes, as to
form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I should
get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an affectation
to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite common in
British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would) have
called immediately. I should (American would) really prefer a different
arrangement. As with shall and will, **[[most educated native
speakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** of American English **[[do not follow
the textbook rule in making a choice between should and
would]{.underline}]{.mark}**. See also shall.

### Obligation

#### Should means 'shall.'

**American Heritage Dictionary**, 20**09** (Dictionary of the English
Language, Fourth Edition)

Usage Note: The traditional rules for using shall and will prescribe a
highly complicated pattern of use in which the meanings of the forms
change according to the person of the subject. In the first person,
shall is used to indicate simple futurity: I shall (not will) have to
buy another ticket. In the second and third persons, the same sense of
futurity is expressed by will: The comet will (not shall) return in 87
years. You will (not shall) probably encounter some heavy seas when you
round the point. The use of will in the first person and of shall in the
second and third may express determination, promise, obligation, or
permission, depending on the context. Thus I will leave tomorrow
indicates that the speaker is determined to leave; You and she shall
leave tomorrow is likely to be interpreted as a command. The sentence
You shall have your money expresses a promise (\"I will see that you get
your money\"), whereas You will have your money makes a simple
prediction. · Such, at least, are the traditional rules. The English and
some traditionalists about usage are probably the only people who follow
these rules, and then not with perfect consistency. In America, people
who try to adhere to them run the risk of sounding pretentious or
haughty. Americans normally use will to express most of the senses
reserved for shall in English usage. Americans use shall chiefly in
first person invitations and questions that request an opinion or
agreement, such as Shall we go? and in certain fixed expressions, such
as We shall overcome. In formal style, **[[Americans use shall to
express an explicit obligation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as in Applicants
shall provide a proof of residence, **[[though this sense is also
expressed by must or]{.mark} should]{.underline}**. In speech the
distinction that the English signal by the choice of shall or will may
be rendered by stressing the auxiliary, as in I will leave tomorrow (\"I
intend to leave\"); by choosing another auxiliary, such as must or have
to; or by using an adverb such as certainly. · In addition to its sense
of obligation, shall also can convey high moral seriousness that derives
in part from its extensive use in the King James Bible, as in
\"Righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his
steps\" (Ps 85:13) and \"He that shall humble himself shall be exalted\"
(Mt 23:12). The prophetic overtones that shall bears with it have no
doubt led to its use in some of the loftiest rhetoric in English. This
may be why Lincoln chose to use it instead of will in the Gettysburg
Address:\"government of the people, by the people, for the people shall
not perish from the earth.\" See Usage Note at should.

### Not Mandatory

#### Should presumes certainty for disads, not counterplans.

**Atlas**, 19**99** (Collaboration, "Use of shall, should, may can"
rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

**[[shall\' describes something that is
mandatory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a requirement uses \'shall\', then
that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied without fail. Noncompliance is
not allowed. Failure to comply with one single \'shall\' is sufficient
reason to reject the entire product. Indeed, it must be rejected under
these circumstances. Examples: \"Requirements shall make use of the word
\'shall\' only where compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example.
\"C++ code shall have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example.
Using \'shall\' here is too strong. should \'**[[should\' is weaker. It
describes something that might not be satisfied in the final product,
but that is desirable enough]{.underline}]{.mark}** that any
noncompliance shall be explicitly justified. Any use of \'should\'
should be examined carefully, as it probably means that something is not
being stated clearly. If a \'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or
can be discarded entirely, so much the better.

#### DOD says should is not mandatory.

**DOD**, 20**03** ("Department of Defense Standard Practice: Defense
Standards Format and Content" August 1, wbdg.org/ccb/FEDMIL/std962d.pdf)

h\. "**[[Shall]{.underline}]{.mark}**", the emphatic form of the verb,
**[[shall be used]{.underline}]{.mark}** throughout sections 4 and 5 of
the standard **[[whenever a requirement is intended to express a

requirements section, state that "The gauge shall indicate . . . " and
in the test section, "The indicator shall be turned to zero, and 220
volts of alternating current shall be applied." For specific test
procedures, the imperative form may be used, provided the entire method
