Renewables are considered by many to be the solution to global warming.
Yes, they can contribute. However, without advanced nuclear energy, we
will not solve global warming. Nuclear energy is much safer than solar
and wind renewables and has a lower life cycle carbon footprint. The
disadvantage of nuclear is its long-lived nuclear waste. To decay to a
nominal background level, legacy spent-nuclear fuel requires tens of
thousands of years. [This paper argues for advanced nuclear, whose much
smaller amount of nuclear waste (about 1% of legacy) will decay to
background levels in about 400 years \[1\]. It is important to note that
legacy [nuclear waste has **minimal risk**]{.mark} associated with it
\[2\]: There is not much of it. [All]{.mark} the [nuclear fuel waste
generated thus far,]{.mark} on the planet, [could be stacked onto one
football field]{.mark} to a height of about 30 feet.]{.underline} It is
a solid, in small pellets contained in metal rods, stored inside
ultrastrong 50-ton containers. [[With **advanced nuclear**, this
**minimal risk is reduced further**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Table 1).
Solar and wind are not really renewable on a 200-year timescale. Neither
is legacy nuclear via current land-based uranium mining. Arguments have
also been made that legacy nuclear is not safe. [[Advanced nuclear
technology is **far safer**]{.mark} than legacy nuclear. The current
widespread [fear]{.mark} of nuclear, which is based on legacy nuclear
accidents, [is unwarranted]{.mark} \[11\]: There were [**no deaths** and
**no negative health effects**]{.mark} from the trivial radiation
release from the Three Mile Island accident. At Fukushima, one power
plant worker involved in recovery died.]{.underline} There were no
deaths or incidents of medical harm to any member of the public from
radiation exposure. Four years later, thorough medical examinations were
given to evacuees from the designated exclusion zone and many concerned
residents from outside the exclusion zone. Nearly a third of a million
children who were age 18 or less at the time of the accident were
screened for thyroid issues. The rate of thyroid anomalies in Fukushima
children was less than in other children in Japan. [Chernobyl was a
**poorly designed** light water boiling reactor susceptible to thermal
runaways.]{.underline} Reported fatalities ranged from 50 at Chernobyl
to several thousand offsite \[12\]. Following the Chernobyl accident,
other Russian RBMK designs were modified to improve safety. Some RBMK
plants have been shut down but not all. No nuclear plants have been
built with this design outside of the Russian federation \[13\].

But now, eight years after Fukushima, the best-available science clearly
shows that Caldicott's estimate of the number of people killed by
nuclear accidents was off by one million. Radiation from Chernobyl will
kill, at most, 200 people, while the radiation from Fukushima and Three
Mile Island will kill zero people. In other words, [[the
main]{.underline} [lesson]{.underline} [that should be
drawn]{.underline} [from]{.underline} **[the worst nuclear
accidents]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[nuclear]{.underline} [energy]{.underline} [has]{.underline} **[always
been inherently safe]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The truth about nuclear
power's safety is so shocking that it's worth taking a closer look at
the worst accidents, starting with the worst of the worst: Chernobyl.
The nuclear plant is in Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the
accident, was a Soviet Republic. Operators lost control of an
unauthorized experiment that resulted in the reactor catching fire.
There was no containment dome, and the fire spewed out radioactive
particulate matter, which went all over the world, leading many to
conclude that Chernobyl is not just the worst nuclear accident in
history but is also the worst nuclear accident possible. Twenty-eight
firefighters died after putting out the Chernobyl fire. While the death
of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth putting that number in
perspective. Eighty-six firefighters died in the U.S. in 2018, and 343
firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Since
the Chernobyl accident, 19 first responders have died, according to the
United Nations, for "various reasons" including tuberculosis, cirrhosis
of the liver, heart attacks, and trauma. The U.N. concluded that "the
assignment of radiation as the cause of death has become less clear."
What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000 thyroid cancers; to date
there have been 6,000. Since thyroid cancer has a mortality rate of just
one percent --- it is an easy cancer to treat --- expected deaths may be
160. The World Health Organization claims on its web site that Chernobyl
could result in the premature [[deaths of 4,000 people]{.mark}, but
according to Dr. Geraldine Thomas, [who started and runs the Chernobyl
Tissue Bank, that number is based on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a
disproven methodology]{.underline}**]{.mark}. "That WHO number is based
on LNT," she explained, using the acronym for the "linear no-threshold"
method of extrapolating deaths from radiation. LNT assumes that there is
no threshold below which radiation is safe, but that assumption has been
discredited over recent decades **[by [multiple sources of
data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Support for the idea that radiation is
harmless at low levels comes from the fact that people who live in
places with higher background radiation, like Colorado, do not suffer
elevated rates of cancer. In fact, residents of Colorado, where
radiation is higher because of high concentrations of uranium in the
ground, enjoy some of the lowest cancer rates in the U.S. Even
relatively high doses of radiation cause far less harm than most people
think. Careful, large, and long-term studies of survivors of the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer compelling demonstration.
[[Cancer rates were]{.underline} **[just 10 percent higher among atomic
blast survivors]{.underline}**]{.mark}, most of whom never got cancer.
Even those who received a dose 1,000 times higher than today's safety
limit saw their lives cut short by an average of 16 months. But didn't
the Japanese government recently award a financial settlement to the
family of a Fukushima worker who claimed his cancer was from the
accident? It did, but for reasons that were clearly political, and
having to do with the Japanese government's consensus-based,
conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt by elite
policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt doubly
aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns. The worker's cancer was highly
unlikely to have come from Fukushima because, once again, the level of
radiation workers received was far lower than the ones received by the
Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw (modestly) higher cancer rates. What
about Three Mile Island? After the accident in 1979, Time Magazine ran a
cover story that superimposed a glowing headline, "Nuclear Nightmare,"
over an image of the plant. [**[Nightmare? More like a
dream.]{.underline}** [What other]{.underline} **[major industrial
tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}[nology]{.underline} [[can
suffer]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [catastrophic failure and **not kill
anyone**]{.underline}]{.mark}? Remember when the Deepwater Horizon oil
drilling rig caught on fire and killed 11 people? Four months later, a
Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline exploded just south of San
Francisco and killed eight people sleeping in their beds. And that was
just one year, 2010. The worst energy accident of all time was the 1975
collapse of the Banqiao hydroelectric dam in China. It collapsed and
killed between 170,000 and 230,000 people. Nuclear's worst accidents
show that the technology has always been safe for the same, inherent
reason that it has always had such a small environmental impact: the
high energy density of its fuel. Splitting atoms to create heat, rather
than than splitting chemical bonds through fire, requires tiny amounts
of fuel. A single Coke can of uranium can provide enough energy for an
entire high-energy life. When the worst occurs, and the fuel melts, the
amount of particulate matter that escapes from the plant is
insignificant in contrast to both the fiery explosions of fossil fuels
and the daily emission of particulate matter from fossil- and
biomass-burning homes, cars, and power plants, which kill seven million
people a year. It\'s not that nuclear energy never kills. It\'s that
nuclear\'s death toll is vanishingly small. Consider nuclear\'s global
death toll in context. These are just annual deaths. - walking:
270,000 - driving: 1,350,000 - working: 2,300,000 - air pollution:
4,200,000 By contrast, nuclear\'s death total is likely to be around
200.

th[[is **not an issue**]{.underline} [with the **new** generation of

water-based cooling system stopped when a tsunami disabled the
electricity source powering the circulation. This is the same risk
Ukraine's Zaporizhzhye NPP is facing thanks to Russia bombing the dam
that held the water that kept the plant's water cooling system
operating. In emerging advanced reactor technologies, however, this
vulnerability is eliminated entirely. [[Many of the]{.underline} [new

Small reactors also cause all of the usual problems: the risk of severe
accidents, the production of radioactive waste, and the potential for
nuclear weapons proliferation. By their very nature, reactors have
fundamental properties that render them hazardous. As a result,
[[**all** nuclear plants, including **SMRs**]{.mark}, can [undergo
**accidents** that could result in widespread radioactive
contamination]{.mark}.]{.underline} This possibility was on full display
in 2011 when three reactors at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant
melted down. The smallest of these, Fukushima Daiichi-1, had an output
of 460 megawatts, only slightly larger than the maximum output of 300
megawatts that characterizes a SMR. All else being equal, making
reactors smaller reduces the risk and impact of accidents. Smaller
reactors have a lower inventory of radioactive material and less energy
available for release during an accident. But [[even]{.mark} a [very
small reactor]{.mark} (say, one that generates under 10 megawatts of
electricity) can undergo [accidents]{.mark} that [result in
**significant radiation**]{.mark} doses to members of the **public**.
Further, [small modular reactor proposals]{.mark} often
[envision]{.mark} building [**multiple** reactors at a
site]{.mark}]{.underline}. The aim is to lower costs by taking advantage
of common infrastructure elements. The configuration offered by NuScale,
for example, has twelve reactor modules at each site, although it also
offers four- and six-unit versions. With multiple reactors, the combined
radioactive inventories might be comparable to that of a large reactor.
Multiple reactors at a site increase the risk that an accident at one
unit might either induce accidents at other reactors or make it harder
to take preventive actions at others. This is especially the case if the
underlying reason for the accident is a common one that affects all of
the reactors, such as an earthquake. In the case of the accidents at
Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant, explosions at one reactor damaged the
spent fuel pool in a co-located reactor. [[Radiation leaks from
one]{.mark} unit [made it difficult for emergency workers to
approach]{.mark} the [other units]{.mark}. The other undesirable result
of any SMR being constructed is increased production of radioactive
waste.]{.underline} The physical process underlying the operation of an
SMR, i.e., nuclear fission, will always result in radioactive substances
being produced. Thus, [radioactive [waste generation is **inextricably
linked** to]{.mark} the [production of **nuclear energy**, no matter
what kind of reactor is used]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite decades of
well-funded research, [[there is no]{.mark} demonstrated [way of]{.mark}
**safely** [managing these wastes]{.mark} because of a combination of
social and technical problems.]{.underline} Claims by SMR proponents
about not producing waste are not credible, especially if waste is
understood not as one kind of material but a number of different
streams. A recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences examined three specific SMR designs and calculates that
"relative to a gigawatt-scale PWR" these three will [[produce up to
**5.5 times** more spent fuel, **30 times** more long-lived]{.mark} low
and intermediate level [waste]{.mark}]{.underline}, and 35 times more
short-lived low and intermediate level waste. In other words, in
comparison with large light water reactors, SMRs produce more, not less,
waste per unit of electricity generated. As Paul Dorfman from the
University of Sussex commented, "compared with existing conventional
reactors, [[SMRs]{.mark} would [increase the **volume and complexity**
of the nuclear waste]{.mark} problem]{.underline}". Further, some of the
SMR designs involve the use of materials that are corrosive and/or
pyrophoric. Dealing with these forms is more complicated. For example,
the ARC-100 design will use sodium that cannot be disposed of in
geological repositories without extensive processing. Such processing
has never been carried out at scale. The difference in chemical
properties mean that the methods developed for dealing with waste from
CANDU reactors will not work as such for these wastes.

What does this really mean when we say that every bridge is slowly
breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair with each passing day,
every reservoir is gradually degrading, every office building, every
factory, every school, every home, etc. most of which adhered to very
low building standards in the first place?

What does it mean when [[the infrastructure for
every]{.underline}]{.mark} sewer [[system]{.underline}]{.mark},
municipal water division, electrical grid, airport, railway station,
etc. [[is in a slow but sure process of degrading and
breaking]{.underline} [down.]{.underline} [So]{.underline}]{.mark},
unfortunately, [[is]{.underline} **[every nuclear power plant across the
planet]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.]{.underline} (Cosmic Convergence)

What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so insidious is
that it almost always occurs subliminally. Through a gathering array of
various forces throughout post-modern civilization, there does exist a
sort of conspiracy of circumstances which has greatly magnified the
effects of technospheric breakdown. The completed marriage between the
industrial base of the Western powers and the financial class throughout
the world has guaranteed that this slow motion collapse will continue
unabated. How so?

Because so many corporate decisions are made according to their impact
on the bottom line, many inferior nuclear power plants have been
constructed around the globe. Likewise, because the mega-banks and
investment houses are now dictating to a financially-strapped Nuclear
Energy Industry, substandard nuclear reactors have been designed,
engineered and continue to be put into operation across the planet. One
only has to take a close look at the websites dedicated to
decommissioned nuclear reactors or cold shutdowns or partially closed
nuclear power plants or emergency actions taken at various nuclear power
generation sites to grasp just how precarious a position the entire
industry is currently in.

Unknown to even many of the nuclear engineers who address these issues
'in the office', or who fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants
themselves, is the notion of slow motion, subclinical,
pernicious technospheric breakdown. It often manifests in ways where
cause and effect cannot be easily established because of some of the
unseen forces produced by atomic fission. With that said, it should be
noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this particular issue
alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear power generation

Then there is the problem of **[[nuclear
wastes]{.underline}]{.mark}** and natural rights, yes?

No one has articulated this point better than Albert Bates in his
definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma: Nuclear Wastes and Natural
Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988)

This extremely lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment
of [[the]{.underline} **[greatest ongoing environmental
disaster]{.underline}** [of our times]{.underline}]{.mark} lays bare the
most basic legal and human rights issues which [[converge around the
production,]{.underline} [treatment]{.underline} [and storage of nuclear
wastes.]{.underline}]{.mark} Were the governments of the world to read
and take to heart its simple and straightforward thesis, the current
incarnation of nuclear energy production would have been abandoned years
ago:

[[FNPPs']{.mark} environmental [risks]{.mark} may
**[heighten]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once a severe accident occurs, for
example, colliding with ships navigating with high navigation speed,
colliding with rockets, or sinking in shallow water, there are risks of
leaking radioactive pollutants into the marine environment. [In the
event of accidents or other catastrophic events, "**nuclear damage could
be of an extreme magnitude**"]{.underline} \[6\]. [Leaked radioactive
materials from FNPPs could then **quickly disperse** into the ocean,
potentially contaminating **large areas of the sea** and causing
detrimental cross-border effects as well as **serious harm** to both
humans and marine ecosystems]{.underline} \[6,47\]. Moreover, maritime
security threats, such as terrorist attacks, armed intrusions, and the
hijacking of ships, may also endanger FNPPs and surrounding waters,
making physical protection against external threats vital for the
deployment of FNPPs \[48\]. In addition, without effective training for
crew members on board, [[human error-induced accidents are **more
likely** to occur on **FNPPs**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Research shows that
human errors are responsible for most ship accidents \[49\]. The
offshore working environment on FNPPs is more stressful for humans
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, compared with land-based nuclear
installations, often lacks enough human resources; consequently,
[[**operators of FNPPs** are **more prone** to making **errors**,

that some radioactive leakage from nuclear-powered ships has resulted in
emergency dumping \[50\].

Third, once the [meltdown of nuclear reactors occurs, it may cause more

were to occur [[at a **land-based** nuclear
installation]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[the radioactive core debris would
[melt into the **rock**]{.mark} below the plant, and the heat would melt

[We live in]{.underline} [dangerous times]{.underline} [for many
reasons.]{.underline} [Prominent among them is [the existence
of]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ]{.mark}[a global nuclear enterprise made up of
weapons that can cause damage of unimaginable proportions
and]{.underline} [[power plants at which accidents can have severe,
essentially]{.underline} [unpredictable consequences for human
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. For all of its utility and promise, the
nuclear enterprise is unique in the enormity of the [vast quantities of
destructive energy that can be released through blast, heat, and
radioactivity.]{.underline} We addressed just this subject in a
conference in October 2011 at Stanford University\'s Hoover Institution.
The complete set of papers prepared for the conference is reproduced in
this book. The conference included experts on weapons, on power plants,
on regulatory experience, and on the development of public perceptions
and the ways in which these perceptions influence policy7. The
reassuring outcome of the conference was a general sense that the U.S.
nuclear enterprise currently meets very high standards in its commitment
to safety and security. That has not always been the case in all aspects
of the nuclear enterprise. And the unsettling outcome of the conference
was that it will not be the case globally unless governments,
international organizations, industry7, and media recognize and address
the nuclear challenges and mounting risks posed by a rapidly changing
world. The acceptance of the nuclear enterprise is now being challenged
by concerns about the questionable safety and security of programs
primarily in countries relatively new to the nuclear enterprise, and the
potential loss of control to terrorist or criminal gangs of fissile
material that exists in such abundance around the world. In a number of
countries, confidence in nuclear energy production was severely shaken
in the spring of 2011 by the Fukushima nuclear reactor plant disaster.
And in the military sphere, the doctrine of deterrence that remains
primarily dependent on nuclear weapons is seen in decline due to the
importance of non-state actors such as al Qaeda and terrorist affiliates
that seek destruction for destruction\'s sake. We have two nuclear
tigers by the tail. [[When]{.underline} [risks]{.underline} [and
consequences]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [unknown,]{.underline} [undervalued,
or ignored, our nation and]{.underline} [the world are dangerously
vulnerable.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Nowhere is
this]{.underline} [risk-consequence equation]{.underline} [more relevant
than with]{.underline} [respect to the nucleus of]{.underline} [the
atom]{.underline}. The nuclear enterprise was introduced to the world by
the shock of the devastation produced by two atomic bombs hitting
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Modern nuclear weapons are far more powerful
than those early bombs, which presented their own hazards. Early
research depended on a program of atmospheric testing of nuclear
weapons. In the early years following World War II, the impact and the
amount of radioactive fallout in the atmosphere generated by
above-ground nuclear explosions was notfully appreciated. During those
years, the United States and also the Soviet Union conducted several
hundred tests in the atmosphere that created fallout. The recent
Stanford conference focused on a regulatory weak point from that time
that exists in many places today, as the Fukushima disaster clearly
indicates. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was initially
assigned conflicting responsibilities: to create an arsenal of nuclear
weapons for the United States to confront a growing nuclear-armed Soviet
threat; and, at the same time, to ensure public safety from the effects
of radioactive fallout. The AEC was faced with the same conundrum with
regard to civilian nuclear power generation. It was charged with
promoting civilian nuclear power and simultaneously protecting the
public. Progress came in 1963 with the negotiation and signing of the
Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) banning all nuclear explosive testing in
the atmosphere (initially by the United States, the Soviet Union, and
the United Kingdom). With the successful safety7 record of the U.S.
nuclear weapons program, domestic anxiety about nuclear weapons receded
somewhat. Meanwhile, public attitudes toward nuclear weapons reflected
recognition of their key role in establishing a more stable nuclear
deterrent posture in the confrontation with the Soviet Union. The
positive record on safety of the nuclear weapons enterprise in the
United States---there have been accidents involving nuclear weapons, but
none that led to the release of nuclear energy---was the result of a
strong effort and continuing commitment to include safety as a primary
criterion in new weapons designs, as well as careful production,
handling, and deployment procedures. The key to the health of today\'s
nuclear weapons enterprise is confidence in the safety7 of its
operations and in the protection of special nuclear materials against
theft. One can imagine how different the situation would be today if
there had been a recognized theft of material sufficient for a bomb, or
if one of the two four-megaton bombs dropped from a disabled B-52
Strategic Air Command bomber overflying Goldsboro, North Carolina, in
1961 had detonated. In that event, just one switch in the arming
sequence of one of the bombs, by remaining in its \"off position\" while
the aircraft was disintegrating, was all that prevented a full-yield
nuclear explosion. A close call indeed! In the twenty-six years since
Chernobyl, the nuclear power industry has strengthened its safety
practices. Over the past decade, growing concerns about global warming
and energy independence have actually strengthened support for nuclear
energy in the United States and many nations around the world. Yet
despite these trends, the civil nuclear enterprise remains fragile.
Following Fukushima, opinion polls gave stark evidence of the public\'s
deep fears of the invisible force of nuclear radiation, shown by public
opposition to the construction of new nuclear power plants in close
proximity. It is not simply a matter of getting better information to
the public but of actually educating the public about the true nature of
nuclear radiation and its risks. Of course, the immediate task of the
nuclear power component of the enterprise is to strive for the best
possible safety record with one overriding objective: no more
Fukushimas. Another issue that must be resolved involves the continued
effectiveness of a policy of deterrence that remains primarily dependent
upon nuclear weapons, and the hazards these weapons pose due to the
spread of nuclear technology and material. There is growing apprehension
about the determination of terrorists to get their hands-on weapons or,
for that matter, on the special nuclear material---plutonium and highly
enriched uranium---that fuels them in the most challenging step toward
developing a weapon. The global effects of a regional war between
nuclear-armed adversaries such as India and Pakistan would also wield an
enormous impact, potentially involving [**[radioactive
fallout]{.underline}** [at **large distances** caused by a limited
number of nuclear **explosions**. This]{.underline} [is true as well for
nuclear **radiation** from a reactor explosion---fallout at large
distances would have a
**serious societal impact**]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the nuclear
enterprise]{.underline}. There is little understanding of the reality
and potential danger of consequences if such an event were to occur
halfway around the world. An effort should be made to prepare the public
by providing information on how to respond to such an event.

Small modular reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**; i.e., nuclear
reactors that produce \<300 MWelec each) have [garnered attention
because]{.underline} of [claims]{.underline} [of]{.underline} inherent
**[safety]{.underline}** features [and]{.underline} reduced [**cost**.

[waste]{.underline} [streams]{.underline}. Here, we compare [three
distinct SMR designs]{.underline} to an 1,100-MWelec pressurized water
reactor in terms of the energy-equivalent volume, (radio-)chemistry,
decay heat, and fissile isotope composition of (notional) high-,
intermediate-, and low-level waste streams. [Results reveal]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} water-, molten salt--, and sodium-cooled **[SMR

of]{.underline} [2 to]{.underline} **[[30]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The

[attributed]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline} [the use of **neutron

and coolants in SMR designs. That said, volume is not the most important
evaluation metric; rather, [[geologic repository
performance]{.underline} [is driven by the decay heat
power]{.underline}]{.mark} and the (radio-)chemistry of spent nuclear
fuel, for which [[SMRs provide]{.underline} **[no

[relatively]{.underline} **[high concentrations of fissile

evaluating criticality during storage and disposal. Since waste stream

2\. SMRs are not generally safer or more secure than large light-water
reactors.

Because of their size, [you might think that **small** nuclear reactors
pose **lower risks** to public health and the environment than large
reactors]{.underline}. After all, the amount of radioactive material in
the core and available to be released in an accident is smaller. And
smaller reactors produce heat at lower rates than large reactors, which
could make them easier to cool during an accident, perhaps even by
passive means---that is, without the need for electrically powered
coolant pumps or operator actions.

However, [[the so-called]{.mark} passive [safety features that SMR
proponents]{.mark} like to [cite]{.mark} may [not always **work**,
especially during **extreme events**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as large
earthquakes, major flooding, or wildfires that can degrade the
environmental conditions under which they are designed to operate. [And
[in some cases]{.mark}, passive [features]{.mark} can actually [make
accidents **worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}: for example, the NRC's review
of the NuScale design revealed that [passive emergency systems could
[**deplete** cooling water of boron]{.mark}, which is [needed to keep
the reactor **safely shut down** after an accident]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In any event, regulators are loosening safety and security requirements
for SMRs in ways which could cancel out any safety benefits from passive
features. For example, [[the NRC]{.mark} has [approve]{.mark}d rules and
[procedures]{.mark} in recent years [that]{.mark} provide regulatory
pathways for **[exempt]{.mark}ing** new reactors, including
[SMRs]{.mark}, [from]{.mark} many of the **[protective
measures]{.mark}** that it requires for operating plants, such as a
physical containment structure, an offsite emergency evacuation plan,
and an exclusion zone that separates the plant from densely populated
areas]{.underline}. It is also considering further changes that could
allow SMRs to reduce the numbers of armed security personnel to protect
them from terrorist attacks and highly trained operators to run them.
[[Reducing **security**]{.mark} at SMRs [is particularly
worrisome]{.mark}, because even the safest [reactors]{.mark} could
effectively [become]{.mark} dangerous [**radiological weapons**
if]{.mark} they are **[sabotaged]{.mark}** by skilled
attackers]{.underline}. Even passive safety mechanisms could be
deliberately disabled.

Considering the cumulative impact of all these changes, [[SMRs could
be]{.mark} as---or even **[more]{.mark}**--- [dangerous than large
reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if a containment structure
at a large reactor reliably prevented 90% of the radioactive material
from being released from the core of the reactor during a meltdown, then
a reactor 5 times smaller without such a containment structure could
conceivably release more radioactive material into the environment, even
though the total amount of material in the core would be smaller. And
[if the SMR were located closer to **populated areas** with no offsite
emergency planning, more people could be **exposed to dangerously high
levels of radiation**]{.underline}.

### AFF - Bioterror Impact

#### Bioterror is existential -- deskilling, globalization, dual use and novel diseases 

**Kellenborn 23** (Zachary Kallenborn, associate professor and associate
dean at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and

[Even more than]{.underline} the fundamental [efficacy]{.underline} of
these new tools, [it is the [deskilling]{.mark} that they engender that
[is central to]{.mark} their [threat]{.mark} potential in the terrorist
context.]{.underline} [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} these
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark},
the [[levels of]{.mark} education, technical [skill and experience
required to engineer]{.mark} a microorganism [are
reduced]{.mark}.]{.underline} 28 For example, in 2017, a relatively
small Canadian biotechnology company called Tonix synthesised the
horsepox virus, Footnote29 which is harmless to humans but is in the
same family as smallpox, which decidedly is not. At the same time,
[**[globalising forces]{.mark}** such as online education, marketplaces
for used laboratory equipment and lowering costs of equipment
[mean]{.mark} that this **[deskilling can rapidly spread]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} even the most unstable regions of the world where
[terrorists]{.mark} and other violent groups thrive,]{.underline} thus
further "democratising" the technology. Footnote30 As an example, the
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition brings
together hundreds of teams of high school and undergraduate students
annually from all over the world, and the winning entries represent
levels of sophistication that several years ago were the exclusive
domain of experienced personnel in advanced laboratories. Footnote31
Moreover, [advances in **[biotech]{.mark}**nology [are inherently **dual
use**]{.mark}, and, unlike nuclear weapons technology, they have
multiple beneficial applications (especially in fighting disease)
[and]{.mark} employ techniques that [quickly become
ubiquitous]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is feared that these [factors]{.underline}, [resulting
from]{.underline} the [enormous strides in]{.underline} **[[modern
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, [will [allow
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, even at the level of [small [non-state
groups or]{.mark} perhaps [individuals, to]{.mark}
essentially]{.underline} first **[[design a disease capable of
existential]{.mark} levels of [harm]{.mark} and [then produce a
pathogen]{.mark} with the required characteristics [to fit]{.mark} the
design]{.underline}**. Footnote32 Such [an **[engineered
pathogen]{.mark}** could conceivably **[disregard]{.mark}** the
generally observed **[inverse relationship between]{.mark}** a
pathogen's **[lethality and]{.mark}** its
**[transmissibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Footnote33 [Nor would
aspiring world-killers be limited to traditional pathogens: **[novel
harm agents]{.mark}**, ranging from transmissible cancers and
bacteriophages to genetic modifications of neurochemistry, [could also
be]{.mark} [considered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The key question becomes how likely it is that terrorists or other
misanthropic individuals will be able to realise biotechnology's most
extreme potential for harm. Expert opinion differs. Some regard the
threat as overblown, citing persistent technical obstacles to the
realisation of the capabilities described above, especially for
non-state actors. Footnote34 After all, there is much we still do not
know, especially in the realms of epigenetics, pleiotropic effects (one
gene having multiple effects), polygenes (multiple genes acting in
concert to have an effect) and epistatic (modifier) genes. Others
contend that, "[[As]{.mark} the molecular engineering
[techniques]{.mark} of the synthetic biologist [become more robust and
widespread]{.mark}, the **[probability]{.mark}** of encountering one or
more of these threats [is **approaching
certainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Footnote35 A recent study by the
National Academies of Science, Medicine and Engineering described the
bottlenecks to modifying and creating pathogens but acknowledged that
[most if not all of these could be overcome in time]{.underline},
Footnote36 with most observers agreeing that the more complex and exotic
achievements will take longer to arrive. However, [even if all of the
obstacles are not surmountable today, the rapid forward march of
biotechnology suggests that, at some point in the not-too-distant
future, terrorists might be capable of brandishing an existential-level
microbe]{.underline}.

[there]{.mark} likely [will be **no immunity or treatment**]{.mark}

understandable given the ability to launch the attack secretly, without
any identification of responsibility. One could foresee many cases, none
of which is as irrational, say, as the world going to war after a
terrorist assassinated the archduke of a declining state in August 1914.
While we cannot forecast the odds of a BVP, a host of experts believes
it is inevitable. A National Defense University study of the GMO threat
found that "the tools and information required for genetic modification
of microorganisms are readily available worldwide." They are also very
cheap, and "the work can be successfully accomplished by a small cadre
\[of three people\]." This study estimated that the materials and
facilities to weaponize a bioagent would cost about \$250,000. "Compared
to other projects that might be undertaken by governments or private
organizations, the cost of equipping and staffing a laboratory scale
bioprocessing facility is trivial." They concluded that "the potential
for corruption of biotechnology to catastrophic malevolent use is
considerable," with "tangible opportunities for many potential
adversaries to acquire, modify, and then manufacture to scale a
potential GMO pathogen."5 [[A BVP]{.underline}]{.mark} or other

with very high fatalities (millions, more than 10 percent of the

billions, [**wiping out civilization** as we know]{.mark}

kill most of the population (more than 90 percent), causing a collapse
that lasts beyond a few years, with the level of pre-collapse
civilization not returning for generations.

#### [New tech]{.underline} makes [acquisition]{.underline} and deployment [feasible]{.underline}.

**Juling 23** \[Dominik Juling (M.A. (Conflict Studies), London School
of Economics), 2023, "Future Bioterror and Biowarfare Threats for NATO's
Armed Forces until 2030," Journal of Advanced Military Studies, Vol. 14,
No. 1, https://doi.org/10.21140/mcuj.20231401005, njn\]

This section of the article will outline how [**[new
tech]{.mark}**nologies [are]{.mark} having [a **major impact** on
biological weapons]{.mark} by 2030]{.underline}. Before analyzing
specific technologies in more detail, however, the author first wants to
point out that biological weapons not only have a purely military use,
but also, like other weapons of mass destruction, have a particular
impact on politics and society. With a large number of digital devices
connected to the internet, online media, and the peculiarities of social
networks, actors could use the threat or deployment of biological
weapons to spread panic and fear. Allison E. Betus, Michael K.
Jablonski, and Anthony F. Lemieux examine the important role of media in
our increasingly digitalized world as follows:

> Violent acts initiate media coverage, as well as word-of-mouth
> transmission, functioning as a gateway that draws attention to the
> terror group and its messages in a manner that increases the salience
> of the communication; then media provides additional information
> contextualizing the original act. Media coverage may make the group
> initiating the communication look more dangerous or powerful than is
> warranted.32

It is thus becoming increasingly clear that CBRN threats are not only
reflected in new hardware, but also increasingly affect the virtual
information and communication space, as well as the public perception of
a real or perceived threat.

A research paper by the NATO Centre of Excellence Defence Against
Terrorism identifies a countervailing mechanism for the interaction of
terrorism and technological progress. In general, military and civilian
innovations influence each other with a reciprocal push and pull
mechanism. This also benefits nonstate actors, who usually focus on
adapting and refining existing and proven dual-use technology for their
own purposes.33 In addition to easy obtainable dual-use goods, high-tech
equipment and material is mostly stolen from professional armed forces,
bought on the black market, or supplied by state actors. In NATO
Strategic Foresight Analysis: 2017 Report, one of six chapters is
devoted exclusively to future technologies. The report describes, among
other things, the rate of technological advances, the number of
individuals with access to the internet, the potential of adversary
non-state actors' access to new technologies, the international
interconnectedness, the amount of data collected, and an increase in the
number of sensors in the world. At the same time, it is becoming more
difficult for states, international organizations, or other frameworks
to effectively regulate potentially dangerous technologies. This is due,
among other things, to the rise of dual-use devices, effects of
globalization, an increase in the power of the commercial sector, and
the rapid pace of market maturity of new technologies, where democratic
mechanisms can often be slow to react.34

The first tangible technologies under consideration are [user friendly
**[AI]{.mark} applications** and web scrapers]{.underline}, which [can
already **easily [search]{.mark}** large amounts of [information]{.mark}
about a certain online topic]{.underline} on the internet or in a
database, for example about [AI can]{.underline} pathogens. then
theoretically analyze or even [[**interpret** the
results]{.underline}]{.mark}. If no powerful computer hardware is
available, capacity can be rented via cloud services. This intersection
could well be [classified as **digital dual-use**]{.underline}. The
consequence is that [[gene]{.mark} combinations can be [**tested** on
the computer]{.mark} before they are cultivated. This **saves time** and
**resources** and can]{.underline} be used to [[develop]{.mark}
pathogens with **[specific properties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
process of producing a large number of molecules by combining and
varying different chemical components using modern methods also exists
in chemistry.

One of [the **most important** future technologies]{.underline}
described in this article are modern biological applications. These
[include **genetic engineering**, **synthetic biology**, and
**biochemistry**]{.underline}. Again, this is an area of dual-use
research. Genetic engineering is the direct genome manipulation of
organisms, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (**[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [gene editing]{.underline}
that [is probably one of the **most important** scientific
**breakthroughs** of recent times]{.underline}. Especially in the field
of biological weapons and nonstate actors, [this is a method that can be
**misused** with **serious consequences**]{.underline}. The special
advantage is that, compared to prior methods, it [[provides
**easier**]{.mark}, cheaper, and more [**precise** additions]{.mark} or
removal of parts [of the **genome**]{.mark} while the organism is
alive]{.underline}. Thus, in the future, [[it will be]{.mark} reasonably
[**easy** to turn]{.mark}]{.underline} bacteria,
[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}, fungi, plants, and humans [[into
**g**]{.underline}]{.mark}enetically **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**odified
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganism[s]{.underline}.35 In general, [this
field is **well researched** and there are many publications
available]{.underline}, as vaccines, for example, are also being
developed using similar methods. For instance, a research paper on the
synthesis of horsepox was published in 2017. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director
of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health, sees [this]{.underline} as [increasing the risk of
**smallpox synthesis**]{.underline}.36 In the future, it is believed
that despite often grave ethical concerns and attempted political
regulation, research will continue to advance. It is often difficult to
regulate and identify dual-use applications early enough. However,
strategic considerations and scientific great-power competition also
play into this technology, as China, in particular, has recently become
known for advances in genetic engineering, which are often seen as
ethically critical.37

[One of the many different aims of synthetic biology is to produce
**synthetic cells**]{.underline} (i.e., synthetic life). In 2019, a
synthetic bacterium was created for the first time from an artificial
sequence of genomes.38 In this way, even very dangerous bacteria could
theoretically be created as if from a construction kit. Research is
currently being done on this with the aim of producing a synthetic drug
delivery platform.39 However, viruses can also be transported and
distributed by synthetic bacteria. Advances in synthetic virology are
particularly relevant to this study. In the future, it is expected that
[[any virus]{.mark} whose DNA/RNA]{.underline}
(deoxyribonucleic/ribonucleic acid) [is available [can]{.mark}
potentially [be **reverse engineered**]{.mark}, bringing viruses that
have been **eradicated** [back into
**circulation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Currently, the National Library of Medicine has a large database called
the National Center for Biotechnology Information Virus (NCBI Virus),
which contains the genetic data of nearly all known viruses, as well as
other microorganisms and mammals.40 There is an important report by the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences, commissioned by the U.S. Department
of Defense in 2018, which describes three particularly dangerous
scenarios of [synthetic biology]{.underline}. In addition to the already
described technique of reproducing viruses with genetic code from the
internet, it [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} mentions the [possibility of
[making bacteria **resistant** to **antibiotics**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and the possibility of programming microbes in such a way that they
slowly poison people through their metabolism. The last method could
lead to death after a long time and thus disguise the crime. Much more
difficult to implement, but [theoretically possible]{.underline}, [is
a]{.underline} so-called [**gene drive** that **automatically spreads**
through the population]{.underline}, altering people's DNA.41

The field of biochemistry is also important, as research into, for
example, metabolism processes in cells, signal molecules, or enzymes
must also be considered in the effect of biological weapons. The exact
impact of this area of research up to 2030 cannot be forecasted
precisely, but it is certain that the impact will be significant.

A new development that could potentially have an impact on chemical and
biological weapons is **[[microreactors]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
form of a continuous flow reactor. Fundamentally, the idea is to
[[allow]{.mark} chemical reactions to take place in a **very small
device**. Advantages compared to large reactors include
[**scalability**, on-site]{.mark}]{.underline} and on-demand
[[**production**, as well as]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}]{.underline}
reaction **[[yield]{.underline}]{.mark}**.42 The small reactors can be
scaled up to almost any size, and expensive, large, and complicated
synthesis facilities in batch reactor design are no longer necessary, as
the cult Aum Shinrikyo once built them. A 2013 study, however, stresses
that the use of microreactors for the production of chemical weapons is
limited. Nevertheless, [future technological **advances** may well
enable a **broader range** of warfare agents]{.underline}.43 Advances in
micro-enzymatic reactors are also expected in the field of biology.44
[This could help future **terrorists** or **state actors** to produce
small quantities of toxic agents in almost [**any place** in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} without significantly putting themselves at
risk during production. Although the implications are not yet well
understood, the cultivation of pathogens could also benefit from the
technology.

Current and future often [dual-use developments in
**[nanoscience]{.mark}** also [offer many overlaps]{.mark} with
**biological weapons**]{.underline} and means of delivery. But not only
potentially lethal applications are being developed; nanoscience also
supports modern material sciences, engineering, and production. For some
years now, several armed forces have been researching machines
frequently called nanobots. However, this often refers to insect-size
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which does not correspond to the "nano"
definition. Nevertheless, these [[bionic insects]{.underline}]{.mark},
which are often only 2--3 mm in size and are capable of flying,
[can]{.underline}, for example, [[deliver]{.mark} a highly potent
[poison **unnoticed**]{.mark} to many locations]{.underline}.45 In a
swarm, technical systems could be manipulated, disrupted, or destroyed.
However, real nanobots (i.e., nano-size synthetic drug carriers) are
also not unlikely in the future. For example, a group of Chinese
researchers undertook the first successful tests for targeted tumor
treatment in 2018.46 On the other hand, [such carriers could also be
used for the **targeted transport** of **viruses** and
toxins]{.underline}. Bacteria have been used as drug carriers for
similar applications for some time now. Theoretically, however, it is
also possible to manipulate unmodified or transgenic insects with the
help of nanotechnology, for example to increase the effect of
distributed biological warfare agents.47

Other applications of nanotechnologies are very small computers, which
will be important for small means of delivery and monitoring of
production of biological and chemical warfare agents.48 In general, by
2030, [**nano**-size technologies]{.underline} are expected to [make
**dual-use** the laboratory equipment needed]{.underline} for biological
weapon production, among other things, [**cheaper**, more effective,
smaller, and more **flexible**]{.underline}.49 In addition, future
attacks with **[nanotubes]{.underline}** may [offer entirely new
possibilities for disguising origin and **lethality**]{.underline}. A
researcher at American University explains: "For example, [[nanotubes
could]{.mark} be used to [deliver]{.mark} only the **lethal parts** of
the **[anthrax]{.mark}** virus---without the **signature protein** that
is recognizable to the immune system]{.underline}." The researcher
identifies three main dangers in linking nanoscience and potential
biological weapons. First, rudimentary nanotechnology labs are [already
available on the internet for under \$500 USD]{.underline}. Second, the
technology makes it easier and cheaper to produce, disguise, and
transport biological warfare agents. And third, the technology is not
sufficiently regulated, which could lead to an asymmetric arms race that
threatens the overall strategic security of major countries.50

The devastating impact of COVID-19 has highlighted global
vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological events. The international
community was woefully unprepared for a pandemic that has led to
millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses, and has
upended daily life. However, notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
COVID-19, it should be viewed as a warning shot.1 It will not be the
last pandemic humanity faces, and the next high-consequence biological
event could be as destructive or substantially worse.

We define [global **[catastrophic biological risks]{.mark}**
(**GCBRs**)]{.underline} as biological events of tremendous scale that
[could cause **severe damage** to human civilization, potentially
**[jeopardiz]{.mark}ing** its [long-term
**survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 The Johns Hopkins Center for Health
Security has also developed a working definition of GCBRs,3 and this
term is part of a broader discussion about global catastrophic risks
that could arise from a variety of sources, including nuclear war,
anthropogenic climate change, and advanced artificial intelligence that
has not been sufficiently safeguarded.4,5 [GCBRs could be caused
by]{.underline} a naturally emerging infectious disease outbreak, an
accidental release of a pathogen, or [a **deliberate
attack**]{.underline}. Naturally emerging infectious disease outbreaks
that can grow into pandemics are likely to increase in frequency due to
urbanization, globalization, and environmental degradation, and [the
world faces an **increasing risk** of]{.underline} high-consequence
biological events resulting from [accidental or **deliberate misuse** of
the tools of modern bioscience and **biotechnology**]{.underline}.6-8
Not all outbreaks or global pandemics will grow to the scale of a GCBR
as we define it in this article and as others have defined global
catastrophic risks more broadly, because the threshold for this type of
event is extremely high.

Although COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it
has demonstrated that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders that the
world needs much more robust protections against high-consequence
biological events that could emerge in the future and be substantially
worse.

In our view, [human-caused biological [events
involving]{.mark}]{.underline} the accidental or deliberate mis[use of
[an **engineered pathogen** are **more likely**]{.mark} to lead to a
GCBR-scale event]{.underline} than a naturally emerging pandemic.9
[Scientists have the capacity to]{.underline} deliberately or
inadvertently [**engineer pathogens** that are more virulent and
transmissible than what nature creates]{.underline} by chance, [and the
**upper limit** of damage]{.underline} that could be caused by a
human-engineered biological event is **[unknown]{.underline}**.10-12
Prevention, early detection, and rapid response are all crucial for
guarding against GCBR-scale events. However, in this article, we focus
on effective strategies for preventing biological events that could
become GCBRs, specifically by disincentivizing development and use of
biological weapons by states and other powerful actors.

Work to prevent the development and use of biological weapons is
crucial. While biotechnology advances offer tremendous potential
benefits---including improvements in public health, economic
development, and climate change---[[rapidly **advancing
capabilities**]{.mark} to manipulate biological systems
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[making it **easier** to
engineer]{.mark} increasingly sophisticated **biological
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5,13 These advances are making it
possible [[for a **wider range** of actors]{.underline}]{.mark} to
exploit biology [to cause **catastrophic harm**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, the devastation caused by [COVID-19 may have
**exacerbated this** vulnerability by making **biological weapons** more
attractive]{.underline} as a means to achieve political, economic, or
other more radical objectives.14

Two types of actors could pose important risks to bioweapons development
and use: states and nonstate actors. Any effective strategy for
countering these risks will ultimately need to reduce the likelihood
that an actor will have both the capability and intention to develop
and/or use a biological weapon that could cause a GCBR-scale event.

To prevent the development and use of biological weapons by nonstate
actors, the most effective strategy is to constrain their capabilities
to cause catastrophic harm. Nonstate actors are not typically motivated
by the same rational economic, political, and military goals that
incentivize states, and they may have an apocalyptic vision aligned with
using biological weapons to cause global catastrophic harm. Lawrence
Kerr has noted that "at one point in time, there were 3,000 named
apocalyptic groups around the world," including terrorists "solely
interested in annihilation of humans."15 It is fair to assume that some
of these groups would readily use biology to cause globally catastrophic
harm if given the opportunity.16 Aum Shinrikyo is an example of an
apocalyptic cult that pursued the development of chemical and biological
weapons, making several attempts to carry out large-scale biological
attacks in Japan in the 1990s; fortunately they were unsuccessful.17
Importantly, nonstate actors usually lack the resources of states,
especially in terms of trained personnel and financial assets, which
makes it feasible to constrain their capabilities by denying them access
to materials, equipment, and the technical expertise needed to develop
or acquire biological weapons. This strategy can be achieved by
safeguarding the tools of modern bioscience and biotechnology to prevent
their exploitation by malicious actors.18-21

In contrast, many [nation [states have **substantial**]{.mark}
**financial [resources]{.mark}** at their disposal [and]{.mark} access
to **trained [personnel]{.mark}**[, which makes]{.mark} it extremely
difficult and perhaps even [**impossible to constrain** their
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} to develop and use powerful biological
weapons. In our view, a much more effective strategy for preventing the
development and use of biological weapons by states is to make the
potential costs of bioweapons development unacceptably high and to
diminish any perceived benefits.9 Although some states may see potential
tactical or strategic benefits of developing biological weapons---or
even using them in some cases---they generally have rational political,
economic, and military objectives that would not be well served by
deliberately causing a GCBR. Nevertheless, [bioweapons development can
have unintended consequences---including accidental release of a highly
transmissible, deadly biological agent]{.underline}---and [[any]{.mark}
attempt at **[targeted]{.mark} bioweapons [use]{.mark}** [could result
in a]{.mark} much larger and more **[widespread]{.mark} biological
[event]{.mark}** than intended]{.underline}.22 For these reasons, we
contend that state biological weapons programs can and should be
countered with well-designed incentive structures.23 Designing and
building such structures is the focus of this article.

Second, and more importantly, no adversary could wisely assume

Because [a **nuclear strike** could]{.mark} in fact [be carried]{.mark}

// ***mosuQ***\]

3\. The difficulty of the problem

[The main reason why scientists and policymakers are **skeptical** of
**existential biorisk** is that [it is **terribly hard** to engineer a
pandemic that kills everyone]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[First, [you would need to reach]{.mark} **everyone**. The virus would
have to be transmitted to [the most]{.mark} rural and [isolated
**corners**]{.mark} **of the earth**; to antarctic **research
stations**; to **ships** at sea, including nuclear submarines on
uncharted, long-term and isolated paths; to doomsday preppers in their
**bunkers**; to hermits and uncontacted tribes; to astronauts in space;
to **each new child born every second**; to **island nations**; and so
on. [And you]{.mark} would [need]{.mark} a **[transmission]{.mark}
mechanism** [that could spread]{.mark} the virus this far [without being
**detected**]{.mark}]{.underline}: otherwise, those with the means would
be whisked away to safety and might well survive.

[Second, you would need a virus that was virtually **undetectable**
until all, or nearly all humans had been infected]{.underline}. That
conflicts in a stark way with the goal of producing a virus that is 100%
lethal, since [lethal viruses tend to **leave a trace** as they spread
through a population.]{.underline}

[Third, you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly infectious**.
The virus would need to be capable of being transmitted, **without
fail**, to every human being on the planet, in sufficient quantities to
actually make them sick. [It]{.mark} would [need to avoid]{.mark}
respirators and other forms of **[protective
equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it would have to maintain its
transmissibility throughout many generations of mutation.

[Fourth, you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly lethal**,
[killing]{.mark} not 90%, 99%, or 99.999% but effectively [all]{.mark}
of those [infected]{.mark} by it, no matter their **age, health, or
genetic makeup**. This lethality would need to be preserved [even
against the best]{.mark} **medical [treatments]{.mark}**, including
quite possibly vaccines or synthesized antibodies. And it would have to
be [maintained throughout many generations of **mutation**]{.mark}
despite selective pressures towards less lethal variants.]{.underline}

[Fifth, you would need to find a way to **evade** basic public **health
measures** such as masking and social distancing.]{.underline} This
isn't as easy as it sounds. How do you transmit a virus to someone who
doesn't leave their house?

[Sixth, [you would need]{.mark} the technological [capability]{.mark}
and equipment [to **synthesize**]{.mark} the hypothesized biological
agent, something it is widely agreed [that **humanity**
]{.mark}**currently [lacks]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Finally, you would need to find someone ~~crazy~~ **\[fanatical\]**
enough to manufacture and deploy this biological agent, yet also
**competent** enough to pull it off, which we have seen is no easy
feat.]{.underline}

I am not sure if I would go so far as to say that the above is
physically impossible. But without a very good argument, we [should
regard it as [**highly implausible** that]{.mark} **all** of [the above
will come to pass]{.mark}]{.underline} by the end of the century.

4\. Human history

We have experienced a great number of catastrophic pandemics throughout
human history. These pandemics have all fallen far short of existential
catastrophe: indeed, they have often failed to cause even local forms of
societal collapse, and only extremely rarely if ever caused a region to
become uninhabited for any significant amount of time.

One of the best known pandemics is the \`Black Death' which swept Europe
from 1346 to 1352. Though the pandemic led to massive loss of life,
there was little evidence of societal collapse or even breakdown of
large-scale social institutions. The historian John Haldon and
colleagues write:

Claims of mortality rates of as much as 50% give the impression that
this event must have been devastating for the societies affected. Yet
when we examine how different states and societies responded, we find
that---without minimizing the terrible impact on people and
communities---the medieval world did not grind to a halt, still less did
a series of revolutionary transformations occur. Indeed, the Black Death
struck at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, and in spite of its
demographic impact both the kingdoms of England and France continued to
field effective armies, even if there was a brief pause in hostilities
(similar to contemporary calls for ceasefires in ongoing international
conflicts in the context of COVID-19). Instead, some societal
developments that were already under way accelerated while various
groups within society responded by exploiting their situation and
attempting to slow down, stop or otherwise control changes which they
perceived as disadvantageous.

Still more [**[devastating pandemics]{.mark}**, combined with other risk
hazards such as brutal colonial expansion, have still been frequently
[**unable** to produce even **regional**]{.mark} **societal
[collapse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, the political scientist
Alberto Diaz-Cayeros and colleagues study the combined effect of
pandemic, violence and other colonialist disasters on Mexico from the
mid-1500s onwards. Despite dramatic loss of life (average settlement
population fell 95% by 1646), most settlements survived, and 13% even
grew by the end of the colonial period. They write:

We develop a new disaggregated dataset on pre-Conquest economic,
epidemiological and political conditions both in 11,888 potential
settlement locations in the historic core of Mexico and in 1,093 actual
Conquest-era city-settlements. Of these 1,093 settlements, we show that
36% had disappeared entirely by 1790. Yet, despite being subject to
Conquest-era violence, subsequent coercion and multiple pandemics that
led average populations in those settlements to fall from 2,377 to 128
by 1646, 13% would still end the colonial era larger than they started.

[Human [history]{.mark} is replete with such examples [of
**resilience**]{.mark} not only to pandemics, but also [to]{.mark} the
**combination** of [pandemics with]{.mark} numerous [other
catastrophes]{.mark}. If our ancestors could survive and flourish with
little in the way of modern medical knowledge or technology, then we
should become relatively more confident in our own ability to survive
future pandemics.]{.underline}

5\. Mammalian history

It is not just human history that provides tales of resilience.
Throughout history, [there is only **one** recorded instance in which
disease has led to the extinction of a **mammalian
species**]{.underline}. Don't take it from me -- here are Piers Millett
and Andrew Snyder-Beattie:

The number of mammalian species that have gone extinct due to disease
(as opposed to other factors) is very limited, with just 1 confirmed
example.

The confirmed example is [the extinction of a species of **rat** in a
very small and remote location (**Christmas Island**).]{.underline}

While we might take the relatively larger incidence of disease-driven
extinction in non-mammalian species as evidence of the threat posed to
such species, if the closest thing to a mammalian extinction that we can
pin on pandemic disease is the extinction of an isolated species of rat,
then we should be hesitant to place too much stock in the idea that
humanity is soon to be driven extinct by disease.

6\. Everything, everywhere all at once

[Effective altruists often draw attention to experiments in which a
**single feature** of a virus was **manipulated**: for example, the
virus was made more **virulent** or more **transmissible**. But that is
not what [**omnicidal actors** need]{.mark}. They need [a virus]{.mark}
which is [improved on a **great number of dimensions at once**]{.mark}:
it must be quite virulent; highly transmissible; have the desired
incubation time; resist likely treatments and antibodies; survive
storage and transportation across the globe; and so on.]{.underline}

[The problem is that [we do not know how to induce **all** of
these]{.mark} many mutations at **once**, and indeed there is a good
chance that work done to produce [one mutation may **cut against other**
desired mutations]{.mark}.]{.underline} A bioweapons expert interviewed
by Filippa Lentzos explains:

I do not think that it's very easy to create weapons of mass destruction
with biological weapons.

Ray Zilinskas' book on the Soviet programmes, for example, points out
how very, [very [hard]{.mark} it is [to engineer something]{.mark} which
is [usable]{.mark} in that context]{.underline}. He lists 12 criteria
that you want in your pathogen for it to be a useful biological warfare
agent, and they include things like survivability in the air,
survivability through whatever mechanical forces are brought to bear
during dispersion, resistance to common antibiotics or anti-viral agents
so that the enemy can't simply treat the disease, high transmissibility
etc. In evolutionary terms, normally as transmissibility increases,
pathogenicity decreases; so you're having to fight nature in trying to
create a perfect biological weapon.

Some of the key lessons that came out of the Soviet programme go to this
issue of pleiotropy, where a single gene affects more than one
characteristic. And if you change that gene to improve one of the
characteristics you're going for in that list of 12, the chances are
you're going to diminish one or more of the other characteristics that
are desirable. So getting something that works is extraordinarily
difficult.

(Let me add for legal reasons that the existence of a Soviet bioweapons
program is contested. So is the fact that someone cracked Kasparov over
the head with a chessboard when he spoke out about certain issues. Make
of that comparison what you will.)

[How bad is the problem? Bad enough that [an extremely
**well-funded**]{.mark}**, decades-long [Soviet]{.mark} bioweapons
[program]{.mark}** [was]{.mark} likely [unable to come close]{.mark} to
overcoming it]{.underline}. The biosecurity expert continues:

In the 20 years of the Soviet programme, with all the caveats that we
don't fully know what the programme was, but from the best reading of
what we know from the civil side of that programme, they really didn't
get that far in creating agents that actually meet all of those
criteria. They got somewhere, but they didn't get to the stage where
they had a weapon that changed their overall battlefield capabilities;
that would change the outcome of a war, or even a battle, over the
existing weapon systems available to them.

Of course, we can insist that designer viruses with all of the
characteristics an omnicidal agent would like them to have are just
around the corner. But we should not pretend that manufacturing such
viruses is an easy task, or that historical programs and experiments
provide any significant evidence in favor of the possibility of
manufacturing such viruses.

7\. Conclusion

This post, and its immediate successors, will give preliminary reasons
to doubt published estimates of near-term existential biorisk. So far,
we have seen that engineering biological events that lead to existential
catastrophe is a very difficult problem; that biological events have
rarely led to mammalian extinction; and that producing all of the needed
mutations at once is so difficult that a well-funded (alleged) Soviet
bioweapons program didn't come close.

[Even [experts have a hard time enhancing **disease pathogens**.
Some]{.mark} observers have also [expressed concerns]{.mark} that
**[synth]{.mark}**etic **[bio]{.mark}**logy [could]{.mark} be used to
[enhance]{.mark} the [virulence]{.mark} or increase the transmissibility
of known pathogens, creating novel threat agents]{.underline}.

Mousepox and [**[bird flu]{.mark}** (H5N1) experiments [are]{.mark}
frequently [cited]{.mark} to demonstrate how dangerous new pathogens
could be designed. But assessments of this threat tend to overlook a
salient fact: In both these experiments, the [researchers did not
**actually** design the pathogens]{.mark}.]{.underline} With respect to
H5N1, researchers had indeed been trying to design an air-transmissible
virus variant for some time, without success. The ferret experiment was
set up as an alternative approach, to see whether natural mutations
could generate an air-transmissible variant. [The [researchers had no
**influence** on]{.mark} the specific [mutations]{.mark}
induced]{.underline}. In the mousepox experiment, researchers inserted
the gene for interleukin-4 into the mousepox virus to induce infertility
in mice and serve as an infectious contraceptive for pest control. The
result---that the altered virus was lethal to mice---was unanticipated
by the researchers. In other words, it was not planned.

Moreover, [some of the [key lessons]{.mark} that came out of the
extensive Soviet program to weaponize biological agents [involve]{.mark}
the [**trade-offs** between improving characteristics]{.mark} that are
"[desired" in]{.mark} the context of a **[bioweapons]{.mark}**
program---such as virulence---[and diminishing]{.mark} other [equally
"**desired**" characteristics, such as **transmissibility** or
**stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pleiotropic effects---that is, when
a single gene affects more than one characteristic---and genetic
instability are common in microorganisms. While it is too simple to say
that increased transmissibility will always be associated with reduced
virulence, this is often the case for strains produced in laboratories.

#### Complexity nullifies the threat.

pbr\]

The second factor is "the perceived complexity of the innovation in
terms of adoption and use".40 This is important in the innovation
literature, as Rogers remarked, ["\[t\]he [complexity of]{.mark} an
**[innovation]{.mark}**, as perceived by members of a social system, [is
**negatively** related to its rate of
**adoption**]{.mark}"]{.underline}.41 [Several scholars of terrorist
innovation have also highlighted the issue of complexity;42 or, as
Cragin et al have stated]{.underline}, "\[h\]ow simple or complex a
technology appears affects [perceptions]{.underline} of how risky it
will be to adopt."43

[In [most]{.mark} cases [terrorist **groups**]{.mark} appear to have
largely [opted for the simplest **pathway**]{.mark} towards the
achievement of their goals and the weapons used tend to be vernacular,
functional devices [drawing on local and readily-available
**materials**, rather than sophisticated]{.mark}, "baroque"
**[technologies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [This is certainly the case with
IEDs]{.underline}, the history of which is characterised largely by
incremental innovations -- although nevertheless frequently effective
ones -- with many means of delivery recycled from the past.44
[[Complexity]{.mark} can therefore be seen as **important** in the
adoption of technology by terrorists generally, but [is]{.mark} perhaps
particularly [acute in the case of **CBW
technology**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some CBW can be relatively simple: "chlorine-augmented, vehicle-borne
IEDs," as employed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from 2006 to 2007 are not
sophisticated weapons.45 Attacks on chemical production facilities, an
apparent tactic of Serbian forces in the early to mid-1990s,46 employed
relatively simple technologies -- specifically explosives -- with
toxicity a secondary by-product. Direct contamination of food,47 drink48
or healthcare products49 does not require particularly sophisticated
technology for the purposes of delivery -- although may require some
considerable skill to culture and scale-up a biological agent -- and has
been a common approach in European CBW incidents.50 Similarly, the
contamination of water systems, something familiar to Europe,51 can also
be relatively easily attempted. However, in **[most cases]{.underline}**
such methods [of **dissemination** have generated results that are far
short of the "**mass destruction**" that CBW are **associated** with,
although this does not mean such a **possibility** can be ignored by
those working on public health **preparedness**.]{.underline}

[Although some relatively simple approaches could cause significant
harm, [mass casualty attacks]{.mark} still [require **considerable
expertise**]{.mark}, something [particularly]{.mark} acute [in the
**context** of bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}.52 The most effective
route to weaponising biology is arguably through the process of
**[aerosolising]{.mark}** agents, something recognised mid-way through
the last century as opening up the theoretical possibility of using
biological weapons on a gigantic scale.53]{.underline}

[However, realising such theoretical potential [is difficult]{.mark} and
[it took states **decades** to develop]{.mark} more [predictable
**biological weapon**]{.mark}**s**,54 and [even then such **weapons**
were acutely vulnerable to **environmental factors**]{.mark}.55 [For
non-state groups such **complexity** has proven a significant
**barrier**]{.mark} to CBW development]{.underline}. By means of an
example, one of the best-resourced biological weapons programs, that of
Aum Shinrikyo, failed variously because the group acquired the wrong
strain, contaminated fermenters and were faced with insurmountable
production and dissemination difficulties.56 [There are of course
exceptions, such as the 2001 [anthrax]{.mark} Letter Attacks in the
US.]{.underline} However, if one accepts the conclusions of the FBI that
this sophisticated attack with aerosolised anthrax in the US postal
system was perpetrated by a US biodefence researcher, Dr Bruce Ivins,57
[it [is an **exception** that proves the rule]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[To circumvent the difficulties with aerosolisation, arguably one could
use [human-to-human **transmissible**]{.mark} biological [agents]{.mark}
as part of a suicide bioterror operation.]{.underline} There are good
reasons for concern over how crude suicide bioterrorists could employ
such a tactic. [However, the [use]{.mark} of highly contagious agents
[is]{.mark} also **[poorly predictable]{.mark}** and would have to deal
with social factors, such as the "spatial contact process among
individuals", which can spell "out the difference between large-scale
epidemics and abortive ones]{.underline}".58

The counter to this argument is the growing access to data and the
changing human geography of the life sciences. [Some 83% of European
households reportedly are [online]{.mark}, effectively allowing access
to what is a growing body of available data on CBW, including so-called
bioterrorist "[recipes" and "**blueprints**]{.mark}]{.underline}" that
are available in both mainstream scientific as well as more subversive
literatures online. It is also clear that there is a changing human
geography in European life sciences (for peaceful purposes), with the
emergence of 30 DIY-bio groups located in Europe59 and some 80 European
teams in the international Genetically Engineered Machines (IGEM)
competition in 2016.60 This is compounded by reports that groups such as
Daesh have deliberately sought to recruit foreign fighters "including
some with degrees in physics, chemistry, and computer science, who
experts believe have the ability to manufacture lethal weapons from raw
substances".61

Whilst it would be unwise to ignore such developments, [[there is a
**need** for caution in looking at the **extent** to which new
**tech**]{.mark}nologies [and geographies]{.mark} will
[facilitate]{.mark} the [adoption of **chemical** and
**bio**]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark} by groups seeking to target
European countries. First, [data is not **information**, and
**info**]{.mark}rmation [is not **knowledge**]{.mark}, let alone the
tacit knowledge [required for **CBW**]{.mark}.62]{.underline} In many
cases a degree of determination and dedication will be required merely
to separate online fantasy from fact and identify operationally useful
information (of relevance to the European context) from nonsense (or
information pertinent to contexts other than Europe). Second, with new
technologies there is the potential for such tools to enable some, but
certainly not all, actors, and [[even then new technologies
bring]{.mark} new [challenges. **CRISPR**]{.mark}]{.underline}, gene
editing technology is currently seen as a particular source of promise
and peril, which purportedly enables "even largely untrained people to
manipulate the very essence of life".63 As much may be technically true,
yet "untrained people" would nonetheless [[require]{.mark} some
[**guidance** in identifying **suitable** areas of genetic structures to
**manipulate**]{.mark}. Moreover, CRISPR [would only get **aspiring**
weaponeers so far]{.mark}, with the process of culturing, scaling-up and
weaponisation [still requiring considerable **attention** and
**interdisciplinary** skills]{.mark}, typically generated through "large
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, and technicians",64 in
order [to be effective]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, for all the progress in science and technology, biological
weapons are still not used, in part, because of the complexity of such
weapons; and the chemical weapons that are used today are largely the
same as the chemical weapons of 100 years ago. As Robinson noted "It
remains the case today that, in the design of CBW, increasingly severe
technological constraint sets in as the mass-destruction end of the
spectrum is approached: the greater and more assured the
area-effectiveness sought for the weapon, the greater the practical
difficulties of achieving it".65

Even if China is willing to fulfill its mission by launching a war with
the U.S., [can [China]{.mark}]{.underline} **[afford it]{.underline}**?
First, [the top Chinese leader [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not ready
for war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with U.S]{.underline}. [China
will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [be able to take a
risk]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** internal [coordination and
support]{.underline}. The voice of China's foreign policy comes from
different departments. [They are]{.underline} **[[not]{.mark} well
[coordinated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and lack]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a long-term vision. [China does
not have a]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
making [consistent and workable foreign policy]{.underline}, and the top
leader has not gained sufficient power to manage foreign relations.
[China is [facing a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mountain of domestic
problems]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[corruption]{.underline}** [in the military]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[Chinese government]{.underline} has [learned the lesson]{.underline}
that [a combination of internal violence and external conflict can
contribute to the]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the
regime]{.underline}. Now **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping
[is]{.underline} more [likely to [focus on]{.mark} China's]{.underline}
**[domestic]{.underline}** [issues especially [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[pandemic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [consequences
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[economic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[financial]{.underline}** [areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xi's [top
priority]{.underline} before the 20th Congress of the CCP [is
to]{.underline} carefully [manage the]{.underline} **[power
balance]{.underline}** [among factions in the party]{.underline},
attempting to ensure his third term of presidency. After the 20th
Congress, Xi will take some time to reorganize the system and put new
policies in place. It is [not wise for the CCP to take]{.underline}
**[military risks]{.underline}** [in dealing with territorial disputes
with various countries at the same time as it tries to
maintain]{.underline} **[domestic]{.underline}** [social
stability]{.underline}. China cannot afford to fight against multiple
countries at the same time because [the [U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[military treaties]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with several allies in the
region]{.underline}. [[Taking military action]{.mark}s
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [**[destroy]{.underline}** [Xi's
China Dream]{.underline}]{.mark}, his lifelong
[[presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}, his [domestic [agenda
and]{.mark}]{.underline} China's [global [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}
eventually. Considering all these challenges, [Chinese
leaders]{.underline} may **[continue]{.underline}** their [efforts
to]{.underline} **[rebalance]{.underline}** [the relationship between
China and the U.S. while boosting]{.underline} the [economic
growth]{.underline} and preparing the unification with Taiwan after the
20th National Congress of the CCP in 2022.

Second, [China]{.underline} has [understood]{.underline} that **[any
conflict]{.underline}** between China and the U.S. [would be
a]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [disaster]{.underline},
especially between the two nuclear powers.78 A war between the two
giants is unthinkable.79 It could be a Third World War if the U.S. had a
war with China.80 China now has 260 nuclear weapons in its stockpile,
while the U.S. has 4670 or more. [[China]{.mark} promised that it would
[implement a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**o
**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se" nuclear
[policy]{.underline}, implying that the country possesses nuclear
weapons only to deter other states from a nuclear attack and expresses
the purely self-defensive nature of China's nuclear strategy. More
fundamentally, [it has demonstrated a]{.underline} viable [path
toward]{.underline} international **[nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}**.81 Many China experts "appear not to be
worried by China's rapidly growing nuclear capabilities, because
[Beijing's official policy promises]{.underline} that [China will not be
the]{.underline} **[first]{.underline}** [to employ nuclear weapons in a
conflict]{.underline}. Beijing promises that its nuclear forces are for
deterrence and retaliation only, not for aggression."82 However, China
continues to develop its nuclear weapons. China is likely to double the
size of its nuclear stockpile in a few years.83 U.S. military leaders
are not as naïve as academics about China's "no first use" pledge.
Charles Richard, chief of U.S. Strategic Command, testified to the
Senate Armed Services Committee that he could "drive a truck through
China's 'no first use' policy, because China's unprecedented rapid
expansion of its nuclear and missile capabilities is not consistent with
a belief in 'minimum deterrence' and 'no first use.'"84 In January 2022,
five global nuclear powers who are the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, the U.S., the UK, Russia, China, and France, signed a
joint statement and agreed to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading and
to ensure a nuclear war would not happen. The agreement itself is a
positive sign, indicating that nuclear deterrence is working and there
will be no massive war between China and the U.S.85 Practically, it is
hard to trust a dictator's words. In March 2022, Putin already put
nuclear deterrent forces on high alert and attacked Europe's largest
nuclear plant just a month after Russia signed the joint statement.

Third, [the Chinese [economy and military]{.mark} are]{.underline}
**[[not strong enough]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to support
war]{.underline} with the U.S. China will unlikely enter to war if it
cannot win because [the CCP]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}**
[afford a loss]{.underline}. China will wage war when it sees itself
winning at least cost. China is the fastest-growing economy in the world
but [there are many]{.underline} more [statistics that]{.underline} come
to the front of arguments, which [question the]{.underline} size of the
[Chinese]{.underline} economy and its actual **[economic]{.underline}**
[situation]{.underline}. The economic and social [consequences
of]{.underline} **[zero-case]{.underline}** [tolerance policy
are]{.underline} clearly [serious and far-reaching]{.underline}. China
is still a developing country. [China does]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rank [among the 100 richest]{.mark}
nations]{.underline} based on **[[per capita]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Among 1.4 billion people, about 50% of Chinese people live in rural
areas, 400 million people live on less than \$2 a day, and 200 million
people live on less than a dollar per day. Even if China will continue
its economic growth for years, [it may]{.underline}
**[never]{.underline}** [surpass the U.S. because it faces]{.underline}
**[many obstacles]{.underline}**.86 [[U.S. military spending
grows]{.mark} as]{.underline} **[policy shifts]{.underline}**
[[to]{.mark} "prioritize China" with]{.underline} **[\$[813]{.mark}.3
[billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2022 [while [China's]{.mark} military
spending has reached]{.underline} **[\$[230]{.mark}
billion]{.underline}** in 2022. China's military budget is only about
28% of the U.S. The PLA has approximately 975,000 active-duty personnel,
the largest navy in the world with an overall battle force of
approximately 355 ships and submarines, the largest aviation force in
the region and the third largest in the world, with over 2800 total
aircraft of which approximately 2250 are combat aircraft. China develops
new intercontinental ballistic missiles, continues to increase its
inventory of road-mobile DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles
(IRBM), and has its first operational hypersonic weapons system, the
DF-17 hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), and medium-range ballistic missile
(MRBM). China is determined to build a "world-class" military by the end
of 2049.87 However, [the]{.underline} [**[comprehensive]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the PLA]{.underline} still **[[lags far
behind]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline}** [If China learned a lesson
from]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**'s failures in the invasion of
Ukraine, [it should never take on the U.S. head even when fully
modernized]{.underline}. Although China's navy, ground troop, and air
forces have developed rapidly in the past two decades,
[[considering]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[quality]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[overall strength]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the
military, [as well as]{.mark} the strength of military
[alliances]{.mark}, China would]{.underline} **[lose]{.underline}** [the
war if it launched a war with the U.S.]{.underline} Any war with the
U.S. will be near its shores where [the U.S. will have a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** [winning advantage]{.underline}.88

Fourth, [China will feel]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** [to
justify a war]{.underline} with U.S. Military strength is the basis for
consideration if China goes to war. [If China's military power is at
an]{.underline} absolute **[advantage]{.underline}**, [it]{.underline}
still [lacks the]{.underline} **[pre-conditions]{.underline}** [for war
with the U.S.]{.underline} If China's military power evenly matches with
the U.S., it should be cautious about starting a war. China has not
arrived at the stage to initiate a war. Military power is not simply
about military budget and weapons. **[Real]{.underline}** war
**[experience]{.underline}** [must be taken into
consideration]{.underline}. [China does not have real]{.underline}
military [experience to win a]{.underline} **[modern]{.underline}**
[war]{.underline} with the U.S. After the establishment of the PRC,
China went to conventional war several times, including the Korean War,
the war with India (1967), and the Vietnam War (1979). It cannot rule
out that China will follow the same pattern to go to war in the future.
However, the Iraq war and the 2022 War between Russia and Ukraine
indicate that contemporary war is completely different from traditional
war. Chinese military power is untested in the contemporary military
war. Moreover, the CCP has not faced an immediate military threat from
the U.S. Military experts' [research projects on when and why
Beijing]{.underline} **[uses force]{.underline}** have [reached
a]{.underline} **[similar]{.underline}** [conclusion]{.underline}:
[[China attacks not when]{.mark} it feels]{.underline}
**[[confident]{.underline}]{.mark}** about the future, [[but when
it]{.underline} **[worries]{.underline}**]{.mark} [its [enemies are
closing in]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thomas Christensen, the director of the
China and the World Program at Columbia University, points out that the
Chinese Communist Party wages war when it perceives an opening window of
vulnerability regarding its territory and immediate periphery, or a
closing window of opportunity to consolidate control over disputed
areas. This [pattern holds]{.underline} **[regardless]{.underline}** [of
the strength of China's opponent]{.underline}.89 The
**[Biden]{.underline}** Administration has [made it clear]{.underline}
that [the U.S. does not intend to change the Chinese regime]{.underline}
while competing with China on various fronts. When China does not face a
direct military threat from the U.S., [the CCP does not
have]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}** [to take risk of going to
war]{.underline}.

Fifth, [it could be [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[suicide]{.underline}**
[mission]{.underline}]{.mark} [if China decided [to go to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} with the U.S. before improving its military
quality. [The]{.underline} **[quality of]{.underline}** military
**[commanders]{.underline}** [is the key]{.underline} to win or defeat
in wars. The quality of fighters and the wisdom of commanders are
inseparable. Wise commanders should be capable of planning and deploying
a variety of plans before the war starts. Even if Chinese military power
cannot match the U.S. as long as they can carry out military strikes at
a right time and at a favorable location, China can still win. Overall,
[Chinese military commanders]{.underline} **[do not]{.underline}**
[possess]{.underline} such a [quality]{.underline}. Soldier qualities
include military skills and knowledge, actual combat and decision-making
capabilities, physical endurance, and psychological qualities. Since the
war between China and Vietnam in 1979, China has been no war with other
countries for more than 40 years. China's active military personnel grew
up in peacetime and enlisted in a peaceful environment. During the forty
years of reform and opening-up period, the military is inevitably
influenced by the peaceful lifestyle. [Although China]{.underline} has
**[dramatically]{.underline}** [increased military expenditures and
speeded up]{.underline} its [military modernization, the PLA obviously
[lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[sufficient actual]{.underline}**]{.mark}
combat **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [involving the integration
of sea, land, and air battles]{.underline}. In recent years, China has
tried to improve its military combat effectiveness, but [the Chinese
military has a]{.underline} **[long way to catch up]{.underline}**
[[with]{.mark} the [U.S.' experience]{.mark} of real war]{.underline}.
The one-child policy seriously affects the quality of the military.
China's active military personnel have grown up in a relatively superior
environment, and men will be particularly favored regardless of whether
they come from the city or the countryside, so they lack self-care
ability, communication skills, patience, and endurance. Their personal
character is very fragile and is likely to collapse on the battlefield.

Sixth, the morale of the Chinese army is low. The [morale of the army is
the]{.underline} **[spiritual pillar]{.underline}** [in the
war]{.underline}; morale makes the war invincible under certain
conditions; and the army would be a mess without morale. Morale is not
an empty political slogan, but it is courage and determination when they
face the enemy. Morale is not injected by propaganda but is nurtured by
faith and the example of officers and actual interests. Under the
one-party system and the rigid censorship system, [Chinese
soldiers]{.underline} like all Chinese citizens [have been]{.underline}
**[brainwashed]{.underline}** [by communist ideas]{.underline}. The
[injected]{.underline} so-called **[communist belief]{.underline}**
[without faith could be]{.underline} **[suddenly]{.underline}**
[collapsed during a real war in a real world]{.underline}. In addition,
China's [corruption is]{.underline} **[systematic]{.underline}**, [and
the military is]{.underline} **[no exception]{.underline}** [from the
top to the bottom]{.underline} of the military system. By January 2015,
sixteen senior military officers were under investigation for
accusations of corruption. These officers are at the corps level or
above. They include one general, four lieutenant generals, nine major
generals, and one senior colonel. After Xu Caihou, former vice-chairman
of the Central Military Commission, was caught in 2014, the CPC began to
investigate Guo Boxiong in 2015, the second former top military officer
on suspicion of corruption. Fang Fenghui, China's military chief of
staff was jailed for life for corruption in 2019. Military corruption
deadly threatens China's security and degrades China's military
capability in protecting its nation. One of the causes of the
Nationalist government's defeat was corruption, which destroyed the
morale of the military. [Chinese [soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[witnessed]{.underline} **[systematic corruption]{.underline}** in the
post-Mao era, [so they [will not]{.mark} be willing to]{.underline}
[**[sacrifice]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [corrupted
[Chinese]{.mark} military [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. To regain
morale, China must reform its political system, clean up corrupted
military officials, change the compulsory military service system, and
improve Chinese soldiers' salaries and benefits.

Seventh, [[peaceful resolution to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[resolve
territorial [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[remains the first
choice]{.mark} for]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}**
[sides]{.underline}. The goal of diplomacy is to persuade your enemy to
surrender without a fight. A weak country does not have diplomacy.
National comprehensive power determines diplomatic confidence; and
military power and popular support provide the precondition for winning
war. If a country's comprehensive power is insufficient, it can only
deal with territory disputer through unequal diplomacy. If the military
is powerful and the people's aspirations are strong, military force
deterrence should cooperate with diplomatic means. If a country is not
ready, it must not advocate war. Otherwise, the government would lose
its credibility at home and abroad. [[China and]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[have]{.underline}
**[sufficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} [time to take]{.underline}
**[[diplomatic measures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to fulfill their
mission]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** [any cost]{.underline}.
In addition, a [possible war over the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[and]{.underline} the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** Strait [is not a
conventional land war but sea-air warfare]{.underline}. [If war
occurs]{.underline} over the region, [the U.S.]{.underline}
**[superiority]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[ASB]{.underline}**
[is still absolute and China's military attempts would]{.underline}
**[fail]{.underline}** although China has massive ground troops and the
largest size of navy force in the world.

Eighth, **[Russia]{.underline}** could be a negative equity for China on
the global stage and [will]{.underline} **[not help China]{.underline}**
[win war with the U.S. after]{.underline} Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}. [[China has]{.underline}]{.mark} very **[[few
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [whereas American allies in the Pacific
include]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}**,
**[Australia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea. While China is losing its neighboring friends,
[the U.S. has been]{.underline} **[strengthening]{.underline}** [its
alliance with China's neighboring countries]{.underline}, including
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Afghanistan, and India. [Other
countries, such as]{.underline} **[Vietnam]{.underline}**,
**[Malaysia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Myanmar]{.underline}**
[are drawing closer]{.underline} to the U.S. The Chinese government
views the regional tension as the outcome of Washington's "returning to
Asia" policy. Under this circumstance, [China needs]{.underline}
**[help]{.underline}** from Russia [to avoid escalating
confrontations]{.underline} with multiple neighboring countries. In a
global context, Russia has played a considerable role in China--U.S.
relations since the Cold War. The recent development of China--Russia
relations has once again raised American concerns about the implications
of Beijing--Moscow relations. Many experts believe that China's motive
for deepening its relations with Russia is anti-America. According to
the joint statement between Russia and China released before the 2022
Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the two countries' relationship has no
limits and there are no forbidden areas. Now there are two parallel
geopolitical conflicts---the Ukraine--Russia war and China--U.S. tension
over the Taiwan Strait. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed that the China--Russia partnership is solid
as stone and the Sino-Russian partnership continues, no matter how
serious the international situation is. China's current stance seems
that China has fully thrown itself into a de facto alliance with Russia.

China and Russia are almost impossible to form a solid partnership.
Superficially, the top leaders of the two countries can get along but
their personal relationship cannot be automatically translated into
foreign policy and military alliances. The restoration of the friendship
between Beijing and Moscow is mainly driven by their domestic pressures
and security concerns. A stable relationship between the two countries
will relieve the financial burdens in support of the hostility along the
sizeable border. Beijing and Moscow also have common interests to work
together. Beijing demands more oil and natural gas from Russia and needs
more advanced military weapons supplies, including submarines, warships,
and aircraft. Russia wants more investments from China to speed up the
development of the Russian economy. Arguably, China does not really need
military technologies from Russia. For example, the Chinese J-20 fighter
is more advanced than Su-35, equivalent to Russia's T50 and the U.S.
F-22. The purpose of China to purchase 24 Su-35 is not to bridge the gap
between Chinese and U.S. military power, but to show its sincerity to
consolidate its ties with Russia by offering economic incentives.
Strategically, they believe that the two nations face similar strategic
challenge posed by the U.S. and its allies: NATO expansion for Russia
and the U.S. conflicts with China over the Taiwan Strait. On the global
stage, they stand against American hegemony with sovereignty and
non-intervention as their core values.90

China's quick move closer to Russia has not convinced the Russian people
to believe that China is trustworthy in part because of the
inconsistency of Chinese foreign policy. China aligned with Russia in
the 1950s and with the U.S. in the 1970s but implemented a nonaligned
policy in the 1980s. In recent years, the Russian protests against the
Chinese economic invasion have taken place from time to time. The most
recent Russian protests took place in March 2019, which were triggered
by a China-funded project to bottle water from Russia's Lake Baikal that
has caused environmental problems and made Russian people very angry.
The Russian protests indicate that the China--Russia tie is fragile.91
China's move closer to Russia has received a lukewarm response from
public opinion in China. The Chinese people also have reasons to doubt
Moscow's sincerity. China is not happy that Russia has maintained close
military ties with and sold advanced weapons to India and Vietnam, both
are locked in territorial disputes with China.92 From a historical
perspective, Russia occupied China's territories totaling more than four
million square kilometers from 1689 to 1898, forced China to sign the
Yalta Agreement for recognizing Outer Mongolia as an independent country
in the 1940s, and stopped all financial and technological aid during the
Chinese economic crisis in the 1960s. Finally, Zhen Bao Island military
conflict in Heilongjiang Province broke out in 1969. Although in 1991
Russia acknowledged that the island belonged to China, the tension
between the two countries along the 2500 miles long border remained high
until the Chinese military troops retreated 500 km in 2008. In addition,
China cannot forget that Russia took the territories in northeast China
more than 100 years ago. On 2 July 2020, the Russian embassy in Beijing
posted a video of a party celebrating the 160th anniversary of the
founding of Vladivostok, which means "ruler of the east" in Russian and
was annexed from China by the Tsarist empire in 1860. The video reminded
the Chinese emotions over historic wounds and prompted an online
backlash with the posts such as "Today we can only endure, but the
Chinese people will remember!" "This ancestral land will return home in
the future!"93 In comparison with China--U.S. relations, the U.S. never
had a single territory dispute with China, so the Chinese people have
not had a similar historical complex toward the U.S. The mutual distrust
between China and Russia partially explains why Chinese students do not
enthusiastically choose to study in Russia. According to Russian media,
in 2020, only about 48,000 Chinese students studied in Russian
universities while 20,000 Russian students were in Chinese
universities.94 By contrast, more than 317,000 Chinese students enrolled
in U.S. institutions in 2020/21 regardless of Covid-19 spread across the
country. The list of other favorite destinations for Chinese students
does not include Russia, but Britain, Australia, Canada, Japan, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Korea. As a result,
Russian culture has little impact on Chinese society and intellectual
circle while American culture is very popular in China. The future of
Sino-Russia relations will be tested by public opinion in both
countries. It is expected that it would be difficult for both countries
to continue drawing closer without the support of the public opinion.

For now, the status of Sino-Russia relations is not a full-fledged
alliance, but a quasi-alliance. It seems that China and Russia are
closer than ever. Although a close relationship between China and Russia
could help China to get more advantage in bargaining with the U.S. to
smoothly solve its territorial disputes with neighboring countries, in
the long run, [[China will]{.mark} gain]{.underline} less but [**[lose
more]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [great power
[competition]{.mark} when China moves]{.underline} **[closer to
Russia]{.underline}**. Moscow and Beijing are on their honeymoon now,
but it may not last long. On the one hand, China's initial move closer
to Russia reflects that Chinese leaders lack confidence in dealing with
potential regional crises alone. Beijing does not necessarily have the
intention to save Russia, but it must save the Putin's regime in order
to retain Xi Jinping's power and the one-party system. On the other
hand, Russia will not satisfy with its lower position under Xi's
umbrella after Russia becomes significantly weaker because of the
failures of Putin's war with Ukraine. Russian ambassador already made it
clear that Russia does not seek an alliance with China. If China
unilaterally pursued the goal, the result would be poor. Therefore, it
is un-matured to predict that China and Russia will become alliances in
a decade. According to Schell-Shirk China Task Force, "China's alignment
is not set in stone. There are significant ways in which China's
long-term national interests are not, in fact, aligned with Russia's,
and deft U.S. diplomacy might still be able to find ways to temper
Beijing's alliance with Moscow."95 In the long term, Beijing and Moscow
might have more potential conflicts than cooperation and could become
main competitors or rivals down the road. [It is]{.underline} **[not
wise]{.underline}** [for Chinese leaders to]{.underline}
**[distance]{.underline}** themselves [from the U.S. by]{.underline}
**[overplaying]{.underline}** [the "Russian card."]{.underline}
Essentially, [China--[U.S. relations]{.mark} will [continue to be
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[top priority]{.underline}** [of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}['s foreign policy]{.underline}, when the CCP
carefully balances the triangle relations between China and the U.S. and
Russia.

Cold War with Chinese and American characteristics

We don't know precisely what the tastemakers, or whoever decides these
things, will call this Cold War. [We should **disqualify** Cold War 2.0
for its **frivolity** and]{.underline} the implicit
[suggestion]{.underline} that [we are dealing with]{.underline} an
**[upgrade]{.underline}**.

My preference is Cold War II, pronounced with the same stresses as World
War II, to remind us (1) of the destruction this rivalry could wreak if
it turns hot and (2) of continuities between the 1947-1991 contest and
the one that began in 2012. Just as many historians now view the two
world wars as a single conflict with a long intermission, we should see
the two Cold Wars as related phases in the evolution of world order in
the post-colonial and global eras.

But [continuities should not be]{.underline}
over**[emphasized]{.underline}**. There are factors unique to the Second
Cold War that will shape its prosecution and outcome:

- **[[Multilat]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}**, and what Fareed Zakaria
  called "The Rise of the Rest," [[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that
  [[neither China nor]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can aim for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
  kind of **[complete [victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [the
  U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [achieved in Cold War I.
  **[Allies]{.mark}**, **partners**, and **opponents**,
  with]{.underline} shifting degrees of [[**commitment** to
  **both**]{.mark} **powers**]{.underline}, now [have experience, tools,
  and agency that they did not have in]{.underline} the mid-[20th
  century. This will [enable them to **modify**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
  frustrate the [[strategies of both]{.mark} major powers]{.underline}
  in Cold War II. [**Multilateralism** will speak against]{.underline}
  the [formation of **blocs** and may involve both]{.underline} great
  [powers in]{.underline} networks of [**compromise** that **[deter
  aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

- Unless there is a military conflict, the legacy of 40 years of
  [Sino-US [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[put a **floor**
  under]{.underline}]{.mark} mutual [[hostility]{.mark}. **Engagement**
  will not cease]{.underline} altogether. Despite downward trends in
  public opinion, [Chinese and Americans]{.underline} have come to
  [know]{.underline} and like [each other **too well** for distrust to
  devolve into **hatred**]{.underline}. Chinese-Americans, who may face
  increased suspicion in Cold War II, will also play a key role in
  keeping lines of kinship and communication open and in reminding both
  sides---the United States in particular---of the historical benefits
  of openness and interaction.

- The legacy of the [first Cold War will]{.underline} also [inform
  conduct]{.underline} in the second. The world has done a version of
  this before: [We have **analyzed errors**, institutionalized
  **successful practices**, and socialized distrust of]{.underline} the
  propaganda and [motives of major powers]{.underline}. Nations are no
  wiser than they were in the second half of the 20th century, but, as
  Cold War veterans, [they are better equipped to
  **resist**]{.underline} traditional **[Cold War]{.underline}**
  tactics.

- [[China and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} both [be
  **distracted**]{.mark} from rivalry [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the large
  number of **[epochal [changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** whose
  simultaneous emergence is the distinguishing feature of the age. The
  [Rise of China is transformational]{.underline}---it compels us to
  reconsider our geopolitical assumptions---[but we are]{.underline}
  also [confronted with **equally great** challenges in other
  arenas:]{.underline} global [**[warming]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
  loss of **[biod]{.underline}**iversity; the [globalization of
  **[supply]{.mark} chains**, **[pathogens]{.mark}**, crime, ideas,
  information, economic disparity, and **[population]{.mark}
  flows**]{.underline}; the [emergence of **[new
  tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies, like synthetic biology and
  genetic engineering; and, on a longer timetable, [**revolutions** in
  gender roles and]{.underline} patterns of [belief]{.underline},
  including rising rates of secularism and religious extremism, that
  will reshape societies.

- We faced nothing of the kind in Cold War I. It's as if the rise of the
  United States, the little ice age, the extinction of the dinosaurs,
  the invention of moveable type, the Reformation, the Gilded Age and
  Great Depression, the Black Death, the Industrial Revolution, and the
  discovery of the germ theory of disease all appeared worldwide in a
  50-year span. Due to the concurrence of these epochal shifts,
  [managing US-China competition]{.underline}---which is the world's
  greatest geopolitical challenge---[may not be the **greatest
  challenge** we confront]{.underline}. The United States and China will
  face pressures to compromise and cooperate during the Second Cold War
  that the United States and Soviet Union did not experience during the
  first. [Meeting these challenges]{.underline}, moreover, [[will
  **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the resources and
  **[attention]{.underline}** that [Washington and Beijing]{.underline}
  can [dedicate to]{.underline} their
  **[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

- While the stakes of Cold War II are high, [[full-bore]{.mark}
  strategic [rivalry]{.mark} may **[never gather]{.mark} steam** [due
  to]{.mark}]{.underline} both nations' **[domestic
  [fragility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Political
  [**[polarization]{.mark}** and international perceptions
  of]{.underline} its failures and [unreliability]{.underline}
  ~~cripple~~ \[**[[devastate]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [[the
  U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as a global
  actor. [[China]{.mark} is [constrained by **geography**
  and]{.mark}]{.underline} by a number of [intractable
  problems]{.underline}, any one of [which could force it to
  **curtail**]{.underline} its [**global ambitions** and turn
  inward:]{.underline} corporate and government [**[debt]{.mark}**; an
  **aging population** and insufficient social safety net]{.underline};
  **[corruption]{.underline}**; **[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
  air, water, and soil; the **[water shortage]{.underline}** in the
  north; stark **[economic disparities]{.underline}**; global resistance
  to Chinese influence; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[sclerotic
  [political system]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is [out of step with a
  modern populace]{.underline}. While these
  [[weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark} might cause either country to lash
  out at the other to build popular support, they could also
  [[**convince** leaders to make **accommodations**]{.underline}]{.mark}
  in the future that they would not consider today.

In the opening sentence of Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger wrote that "in
every century there seems to emerge a country with the power, the will,
and the intellectual and moral impetus to shape the entire international
system in accordance with its own values." [Many]{.underline} Chinese
would [read]{.underline} that line as an [anointing of]{.underline} the
People's Republic of [**China** for the 21st century. They would be
**wrong**. While [China]{.mark} has the **will** to shape]{.underline}
the [international system]{.underline}, its [[power]{.mark} is
**[uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and its [intellectual and moral
[preparation is **non-existent**]{.mark}]{.underline} to insufficient.
The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is still]{.mark} the world's **[most powerful]{.mark}
nation**]{.underline}, but it must undergo a protracted and uncertain
healing process before it is fit to reassert

[There are]{.underline} a number of **[[formidable
restraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in place to keep the
peace]{.underline}. The United States has worked hard over the decades
to build these barriers---often as part of the very engagement strategy
that Mearsheimer criticizes. [These bulwarks have [helped preserve
peace]{.mark} and promote prosperity [for]{.mark}]{.underline} the last
[**[70 years]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} they [are **still strong
enough**]{.mark}]{.underline} to prevent a **[[U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although [accidents or
incidents]{.underline} connected to military brinkmanship may occur,
they [would **almost certainly not**]{.underline} lead [to a wider
**[war]{.mark}**. That [would require]{.mark}]{.underline} something
exceedingly unlikely: [[the **simultaneous failure of every
restraint**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

First, [bilateral [diplomacy would have to **break
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engagement is the opposite of estrangement,
which describes the absence of U.S.-Chinese relations from 1949 to 1972.
The purpose of engagement is to forestall misperceptions, provide
reassurance, and prevent conflict. It is true that diplomacy and
communication between China and the United States have been anemic for
the past five years. And it is difficult to discern authoritative policy
amid the current cacophony of diplomatic posturing on Twitter and
elsewhere, creating an environment ripe for confusion and overreaction.
But these deficiencies are not structural; they can be remedied. If
top-level leaders in both countries consistently communicate and work to
reduce public posturing, as they should, then the diplomatic barriers to
war can be reinforced.

For a war to break out, [the international system would also have to
fail. China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are
connected to [a **global network** of]{.mark} [**countries** and
**institutions**]{.mark} that [have]{.mark}]{.underline} a stake---in
some cases, [[an **existential stake**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in
**preventing conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} between these two
countries. Almost [**[every government]{.mark}** and **institution** on
the globe [would be **grievously damaged**]{.mark} by a U.S.-Chinese
war]{.underline}, and so [they [**all** would]{.mark} try to
[prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} an imminent [[conflict through
**diplomatic pressure**, **mediation**, or]{.underline}]{.mark} acts of
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as denying overflight and
basing rights. Critics may be quick to deny the influence of others in
heading off a major-power clash. But in the current international
system, there is no way for either side to emerge victorious, and those
outside China and the United States would see this most clearly.

[Then there is the restraint created by **globalization**]{.underline}.
Mearsheimer argues that it was a catastrophic mistake for the United
States to help China grow wealthy, as its resulting strength will
inevitably lead it to challenge the United States. But it is also
plausible that [[the]{.mark} inextricably [integrated]{.mark} nature of
the [global economy]{.mark}, and **specifically** of the Chinese and
U.S. economies, [makes **any war unwinnable**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
thus [acts as a **deterrent to conflict**]{.underline}. It is true, as
critics will point out, that economic dependencies failed to prevent
[World War I]{.underline}. But [the economic relations of the early
twentieth century were **nothing like** the **complex entanglements** of
today's international economic system. In]{.underline} the case of
[China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [they
[create]{.mark}]{.underline} a situation of **[mutual [assured economic
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Another restraint is **public opinion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
on the U.S. side. [[Politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United
States respond to various incentives, but they [**[cannot
ignore]{.mark}** the sentiments of their [voters]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And [[after a **20-year fight** against terrorism, the]{.mark} American
[public is]{.mark}]{.underline} decidedly [[**wary** of]{.mark}
**protracted** and **costly [overseas conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
If U.S. policymakers appeared poised for a conflict with China, one
would also expect that the press, having learned its lesson from the war
in Iraq, would perform its watchdog function, question the official
narratives, and activate public concern.

[All these barriers]{.underline} should work to [prevent]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline}. [But if they **somehow didn't**, [there is a
**final fail-safe**]{.mark} that is **even harder** to imagine not
working]{.underline}: military **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Taiwan is the most likely issue over which a U.S.-Chinese war could
break out. But [the quantity and quality of [the weaponry]{.mark} on
both sides [translates to **certain catastrophic losses**]{.mark} for
**all**, which should provide a sufficient deterrent to
war]{.underline}. And because the devastation of a conflict over Taiwan
would spiral out of control quickly, one cannot rule out the use of
nuclear weapons. Strange as it may sound, that is good news: just as the
nuclear age prevented direct military conflict between the Soviet Union
and the United States for more than 40 years, so it should between
[[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, both of which [[are
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}-armed [[powers with]{.mark} survivable
[second-strike capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although China has
many fewer missiles and warheads than the United States---something
China is working on remedying---the doctrine of
**[m]{.underline}**utually **[a]{.underline}**ssured
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [still operates]{.underline}. **[[The
balance of terror holds]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Incidents at sea are [non]{.underline}-[escalatory]{.underline}\-\--[lowest]{.underline} [threat]{.underline}.

On the surface, given the publicity that clashes at sea garner, such a
fear may seem well-founded. 4 Numerous studies have revealed the
propensity for conflict escalation over the issue of sovereign control
of land, including disputed islands. 5 However, the potential for
escalation arising from incidents at sea and the strategic effect of
such incidents remain largely understudied phenomena. 6 [By focusing
solely on [incidents at **sea**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this article
argues that in areas of contested maritime jurisdictional claims or
maritime zones in which strategic competitors meet, peaceful
interactions among military, law-enforcement, and civilian actors should
not be expected. However, [accidental, inadvertent, or even intentional
acts that result in clashes between rival forces should [**not trigger
sustained escalatory cycles** or be]{.mark} construed as [a **prelude to
major conflict**]{.mark} at sea or on land]{.underline}. Rather, such
events should be viewed as an expected consequence of operations in
contested maritime environments. In short, [at sea, [the threshold for
**stability**]{.mark} in contested areas [is
**low**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and therefore escalatory incidents are
likely; however, [escalatory cycles or sustained conflict, including war
at sea, are **unlikely** to follow such incidents]{.underline}.

To justify this contention, this article argues that a [maritime
strategic environment imposes specific conditions on escalatory and
triggering dynamics. Disputed maritime borders, unlike those on land,
cannot be held, and thus must be contested. Despite this requirement of
contestation and the impossibility of exercising total control,
[conflicts at sea typically do not present an **existential strategic
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the involved parties. [[Escalation
arising from inadvertence or miscalc]{.mark}ulation [is **easier to
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}, owing to the realities of operating in a
maritime environment. 7 At an operational level, [it is [easier to
achieve **controlled deescalation**]{.mark} at sea than on
land]{.underline}. [The [options to use **new** weapons]{.mark} systems
[or attack new]{.mark} types of [targets]{.mark} (**vertical
escalation**) [are limited, and **geographic expansion**]{.mark} of the
area of conflict (**horizontal escalation**) [is
**unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 8

[[**De-escalation** after an incident is facilitated by the fact that

withdrawal are reduced]{.mark}, as [such a move does not result]{.mark}
automatically [in the **loss of territory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Further, [the size of the maritime environment, coupled with the speed
of clashes at sea, [allows for **easier de-escalation**]{.mark}, as time
is needed to concentrate often-dispersed maritime forces. [Organic
escalation therefore is **less likely** to occur]{.mark}]{.underline},
since political and military elites would be required to commit
expensive assets intentionally to continue a clash. Equally, information
gathering also is hindered by the nature of operations at sea. Time
often is required to ascertain facts fully, and this gap allows for
political and strategic tensions to cool.

#### No [North Korea]{.underline} war.

For Now, It's the Economy

Ascertaining Kim's intent is difficult, but North Korea is not the
"black hole" some describe it to be. For the past several years, Kim has
used major Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) meetings, particularly in the
final days of the year, to present reports or speeches that summarize
advances across political, ideological, economic, national defense,
diplomacy, and inter-Korean relations sectors over the past year,
describe the environment and challenges that North Korea faces, and lay
out goals and priorities for the coming year. Such reports should be
taken with a grain of salt: there is no way of verifying claims of
accomplishments, prioritization of goals, or precise details of the
various objectives. That said, such documents serve as guidelines or
"commander's intent" for North Koreans across all sectors of society,
and are often reinforced with various rallies, study sessions, project
launches, resource and personnel movements, and other efforts.

Two recent significant political meetings---the 9th Expanded Plenum of
the WPK Central Committee 8th Party Congress in late December 2023 and
the 19th Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the 8th Central
Committee of the WPK in January 2024---provided opportunities for Kim to
articulate his policies for the near term, with a focus on economic
development. While [[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} admitted that the road
ahead would be difficult, he [[made a]{.mark}n impassioned [call for
**maximum** state]{.mark} and party **[efforts]{.mark}** to be directed
[toward]{.mark} improving **[economic conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
throughout the country. Reports of discharged soldiers being sent to the
countryside, and the KPA doing its part to contribute to national
development, reflect the fact that [[North Korea is **not**]{.mark} a
country [**mobilizing** for **imminent war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[That said, Kim troublingly continues to **prioritize** advancement of
his **WMD program**]{.underline}. More launches and testing will come in
2024, as seen in North Korea's claimed test of a "new solid-fuel
hypersonic missile with intermediate range" on January 15 and test of a
"new-type strategic cruise missile" on January 24. The KPA's winter
training cycle will overlap with the upcoming U.S.-South Korea annual
military exercises, providing an environment conducive to North Korea to
ratchet up pressure and tension to support its standing disinformation
messaging efforts to portray the United States and South Korea as
culprits. It is impossible to rule out heightened rhetoric, bombastic
proclamations and threats, shows of force, challenges to the Northern
Limit Line that has served to separate maritime activities of the two
sides in the West Sea, and perhaps even a lethal provocation of limited
scale designed to foment criticism of North Korea policies in both Seoul
and Washington. [As regrettable as such [coercive behavior is]{.mark},
it is likely to be [**limited** in scope]{.mark}, with sufficient
de-escalation built in: [**all-out war** seems to be the **last thing**
Kim seeks]{.mark} at this time.]{.underline}

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Indo-Pacific War\-\--AT: Taiwan

#### No [Taiwan]{.underline} war.

**Bremmer 23'** -- Ian, President of Eurasia Group, Foreign Affairs
Columnist and Editor-at-Large at TIME, Ph.D. in Political Science from
Stanford University. "Why China Won\'t Invade Taiwan Anytime Soon",
TIME, https://time.com/6270599/china-invade-taiwan, 04-12-2023

All that said, [the actual [risk of]{.mark} imminent [Chinese military
action against Taiwan]{.mark} remains [**low**. Beijing **always
flexes**]{.mark} military muscle]{.underline} when highest-level U.S.
and Taiwanese officials meet face to face. Yet, though Speaker
McCarthy's visit with Taiwan's president marks the highest-level
U.S.-Taiwan meeting on US soil since 1979, China's latest response was
less militarily threatening than its reaction to last summer's visit to
Taiwan by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- and Beijing is well aware that
Washington will notice that.

More importantly, [[Xi is spending]{.mark} considerable
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline} these days [on playing a larger role on the
global stage]{.underline}, particularly [[as a **peacemaker**]{.mark}.
He]{.underline} has [offered a 12-point peace plan for
Ukraine]{.underline} he hopes will encourage others to see China as a
global mediator, even if this particular plan has no chance of success.
This past weekend, [Xi [welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline} French President
Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} and European Commission Chairman
Ursula Von der Leyen to Beijing for discussion of the Ukraine war and
the future of China's relations with Europe more broadly. Though Xi
didn't promise his European guests to lean harder on Russia, [the
Chinese and French governments issued a joint statement pledging they
would work together to bring Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to
the]{.underline} bargaining [table]{.underline}.

[This [follows]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkable [[visit]{.mark} to
China of the foreign ministers [of]{.mark}]{.underline} Middle East
rivals [[Iran and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, where they agreed
under China's mediation to improve their historically contentious
relationship. Most importantly, just days ago[, Taiwan's former
president [Ma]{.mark} Ying-jeou became the first current or former
Taiwanese leader to [visit the mainland]{.mark}]{.underline} since
Taiwan broke away in 1949, and during his visit he spoke of the "common
inheritance of blood, language, history and culture" between the two
sides, raising hopes in Beijing that reunification can still be achieved
without risking a potentially catastrophic conflict. In short,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [wants to be]{.underline} (at least
perceived as) **[a peacemaker]{.underline}**, and though Taiwan's future
remains of far more importance to him that any of these issues, [China's
president is **[unlikely to reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline} all these
[**[diplomatic victories]{.mark}** by stumbling into a costly
war]{.underline}.

There are more basic reasons why China is unlikely to move against
Taiwan soon. [Xi has [watched]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully
[as]{.underline} Russia's President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [provided a vivid demonstration
of]{.underline} just [how [**unpredictable, costly**, and
**humiliating**]{.mark} an ill-conceived [war]{.mark} can be. Taiwan,
backed with generations of]{.underline} sophisticated and powerful
[American weapons, has been preparing]{.underline} for a possible
Chinese invasion [even longer than Ukraine]{.underline} has prepped for
a full-frontal assault from Russia, and [[given]{.mark} the]{.underline}
complete [[lack of]{.mark} Chinese [combat experience]{.mark}
over]{.underline} the past [44 years, [Xi]{.mark}
[understands]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[the risks of [Pyrrhic
victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[or]{.underline}** even of
**[defeat]{.underline}** -- **[are real]{.underline}**. At a time [when
China is [emerging from]{.mark}]{.underline} the world's most draconian
lockdown and [its worst economic [slowdown]{.mark} in decades, Xi is
[likely to be **extra careful**]{.mark} **about the fights he
picks**]{.underline}. At least for now.

There's also the critical issue of semiconductors. About [90 percent
of]{.underline} the world's most sophisticated [computer chips are made
in Taiwan]{.underline}. Aware of the risk this creates, China, the U.S.,
and others are working as quickly as possible to lessen the risk of
economic catastrophe that would result if that production were
dramatically slowed or even halted, but self-sufficiency in chip
production is years away for every country. [China is [loath to
risk]{.mark} conflict that would leave [its economy]{.mark} without
access to the]{.underline} 21st century's [most important economic
resource]{.underline}.

One day, China may invade Taiwan, triggering a war with global
implications. But that day isn't soon. When and if it does, the [timing
will be determined by]{.underline} China's leader, not as the result of
any diplomatic provocation, but by his own calculation of [benefit and
cost]{.underline}. For now, it's still possible to hope that **[[cooler
heads]{.mark} can]{.underline}** one day **[[find a diplomatic
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to avert a war that would have
disastrous implications far beyond Asia.

#### Nationalism and CCP motivation [won't]{.underline} motivate China to invade [Taiwan]{.underline}.

Taiwan Alarm Over a Chinese Invasion Could Become a Self-Fulfilling

[In the West and parts of Asia, concern is]{.underline}
**[mounting]{.underline}** [that China might invade Taiwan to distract
from]{.underline} **[mounting domestic challenges]{.underline}** [or
because Chinese leaders imagine that their **window of opportunity** to
seize the island **is closing**.]{.underline} Facing an economic
slowdown and rising unemployment, some analysts argue, Beijing might be
tempted to launch a military offensive to rally popular support. In
January 2023, for instance, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu,
speculated that Chinese President Xi Jinping might create an external
crisis "to divert domestic attention or to show to the Chinese that he
has accomplished something." Ot[her analysts warn of an impending war
because China's rise is slowing.]{.underline} In their view, Beijing
might try to seize the opportunity to use force against Taiwan while it
has the advantage. Admiral Mike Gilday, chief of U.S. naval operations,
suggested in October 2022 that China could try to take Taiwan as early
as 2022 or 2023. Other U.S. officials, including Mark Milley, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and William Burns, the director
of the CIA, have cautioned that Xi has not yet decided to invade Taiwan.
But there is growing concern among some Western security analysts and
policymakers that once the People's Liberation Army (PLA) believes it
has the military capability to invade Taiwan and hold the United States
at bay, Xi will order an invasion. [[Fears that China will]{.mark} soon
[invade]{.mark} Taiwan **[are]{.mark} [overblown]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There is **little evidence**]{.underline} [that Chinese leaders see a
closing window for action]{.underline}. Such fears appear to be driven
more by Washington's assessments of its own military vulnerabilities
than by Beijing's risk-reward calculus. Historically, Chinese leaders
have not started wars to divert attention from domestic challenges, and
they continue to favor using measures short of conflict to achieve their
objectives. If anything, problems at home have moderated Chinese foreign
policy, and Chinese popular opinion has tended to reward government
bluster and displays of resolve that do not lead to open conflict. [If
Western [policymakers **exaggerate**]{.mark} **the [risk]{.mark}** of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan, they might **inadvertently create a
self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.underline}. Instead of worrying that
Beijing will gin up a foreign crisis to bolster its standing at home or
assuming that Beijing feels pressured to invade in the near term, the
United States should focus on arresting---or at least decelerating---the
action-reaction spiral that has steadily ratcheted up tensions and made
a crisis more likely. That does not mean halting efforts to bolster
Taiwan's resilience to Chinese coercion or to diversify the United
States' defense posture in the region. But it does mean avoiding
needless confrontation and identifying reciprocal steps that Washington
and Beijing could take to lower the temperature. The hard but crucial
task for U.S. policymakers is to thread the needle between deterrence
and provocation. Symbolic displays of resolve, unconditional commitments
to defend Taiwan, and pledges of a surge in U.S. military power in the
region could stray too far toward the latter, inadvertently provoking
the very conflict U.S. policymakers seek to deter. WAG THE DOG?
[Although the logic of diversionary aggression has **an intuitive
appeal**]{.underline}, [there is little reason to think that domestic
challenges will **tempt China's leadership**]{.underline} [to launch a
war abroad.]{.underline} In a 2008 review of [[cross-national
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} of international conflict, the scholars
Matthew [Baum and]{.underline} Philip [Potter
[found]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[little]{.mark} consistent
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} world [leaders
starting]{.mark} military [hostilities to whip up]{.mark} domestic
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[authoritarian leaders]{.mark}
may be]{.underline} **[less likely]{.underline}** [than democratic ones
to]{.underline} **[initiate crises]{.underline}** in [the wake of
domestic unrest]{.underline} because [they [have]{.mark} **greater
[latitude]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to repress]{.mark} their
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}, the political scientist Chris Gelpi has
found. And [[rather than embark on]{.mark} risky [military
adventures]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leaders facing domestic
challenges]{.underline} often **[choose other means]{.underline}** [to
quell discontent, including]{.underline} **[working with other
states]{.underline}** to address threats from within---for instance, by
settling border disputes to calm unrest on their frontiers---[or
**resorting to repression**. [China's]{.mark} [response]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} once-in-a-generation protests against its [draconian
COVID]{.mark}-[19]{.mark}]{.underline} restrictions late last year
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a [case in point]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[After demonstrators took to the streets]{.underline} in dozens of
cities carrying sheets of blank paper---symbols of resistance in the
face of censorship---[[the]{.mark} Chinese [government]{.mark} **did not
seek**]{.underline} [to deflect attention]{.underline} from domestic
discontent with aggressive foreign policy measures. Instead,
[it]{.underline} **[[eased]{.mark} its COVID-19
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [detained and interrogated
protesters]{.underline}, [and continued its post-pandemic efforts to
reassure foreign investors. [Chinese leaders have given]{.mark}
**[few]{.mark} [signs]{.mark}** that domestic [insecurity]{.mark} [might
**prompt**]{.mark} **them to [lash out]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
Taiwan.]{.underline} On the contrary, Xi [and [the]{.mark}
[C]{.mark}]{.underline}hinese [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommunist
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty leadership [have [sought to
**project**]{.mark} **an image of [confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[patience]{.underline}** [in the face of growing
international risks and challenges]{.underline}. Despite pessimism in
China about trends in public opinion that show Taiwan pulling away from
the mainland politically and culturally, Xi told the CCP's 20th Party
Congress in October 2022 that "the wheels of history are rolling on
toward China's reunification." Xi has sought to project an image of
confidence and patience. [Historically, Chinese leaders have tended
to]{.underline} **[temper their foreign policy]{.underline}** [during
times of domestic turmoil.]{.underline} Sometimes, [they have engaged in
**harsh rhetoric**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[saber
rattling]{.underline}**, [but they have **only rarely**]{.underline}
[launched military operations]{.underline} in such periods. Even
Chairman Mao Zedong, who ordered the shelling of offshore islands in
1958, sought to mobilize the Chinese population while avoiding an
outright war over Taiwan, warning that China must only fight battles it
is sure of winning. [According to]{.underline} the political scientist
M. Taylor [Fravel]{.underline}, [China has **compromised in 15 of the
17** territorial disputes]{.underline} it has settled with its neighbors
since 1949---most of them during periods of regime insecurity arising
from domestic political challenges, including unrest in Tibet and
Xinjiang in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tiananmen Square
protests in 1989, and renewed unrest in Xinjiang in the early 1990s. In
an analysis of Beijing's behavior in militarized interstate disputes
between 1949 and 1992, moreover, the political scientist Alastair Iain
[[Johnston found]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[no
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between]{.mark} domestic [unrest
and]{.mark} [China's use of force]{.mark} externally]{.underline}." If
anything, [the [frequency]{.mark} of China's]{.underline} [involvement
in militarized]{.underline} [interstate]{.underline}
[disputes]{.underline} **[[declined when]{.mark} domestic [unrest
increased]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On the whole, in other words, [Chinese
leaders have done the]{.underline} **[opposite]{.underline}** [of what
many analysts are warning:]{.underline} [they have sought to **reduce
external tensions**]{.underline} in order to tackle domestic challenges
from a position of greater strength while attempting to deter foreign
efforts to exploit internal tensions. [Beijing's behavior in the East
and South China Seas has followed this pattern]{.underline}. During two
flare-ups with Tokyo in the 1990s over the island chain known as the
Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, for instance, Chinese leaders
quashed expressions of popular antipathy toward Japan with the aim of
preserving economic ties with Tokyo, according to the international
relations scholars Phillip Saunders and Erica Downs. And the political
scientist Andrew Chubb has shown that between 1970 and 2015, Chinese
leaders tended to be less aggressive at sea during periods of internal
strife. [When Beijing did act assertively in these maritime territorial
disputes, it did so **mainly to thwart perceived challenges** with new
capabilities, **not to distract** from heightened **domestic
insecurity**.]{.underline} BARK NOT BITE Claims that Beijing is looking
for opportunities to lash out for domestic political purposes aren't
just wrong. They are dangerous because they imply that U.S. actions have
no bearing on China's calculus on Taiwan and that the only way to deter
Beijing from diversionary aggression is to deny it the ability to
prevail in such an endeavor. [Domestic considerations and the military
balance of power are **not the only factors**]{.underline} [Xi will
weigh when deciding whether to attack Taiwan]{.underline}. Even if he
prefers to avoid a near-term conflict and believes that China's military
prospects will improve over time, he might still order a military
operation if he and other Chinese leaders perceive a sharp increase in
the risk that Taiwan could be lost. As Fravel has shown, China has often
used military force to counter perceived challenges to its sovereignty
claims in territorial and maritime disputes. Such challenges, including
U.S. actions that endorse Taiwan as an independent state or suggest that
Washington might be on the cusp of restoring a formal alliance with the
island, might trigger such a reaction from China. Even so, Beijing has
less risky ways to respond to perceived provocations, including rhetoric
and actions that could burnish its nationalist credentials without
escalating to military conflict. As I have previously argued in Foreign
Affairs, [[China's leaders]{.mark} frequently [engage]{.mark} in
[rhetorical bluster to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[appease]{.mark}**
domestic [audiences]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **minimize** the popular
**costs** of not **using military force**]{.underline}. [[They
ma]{.mark}y also [choose]{.mark} from a variety of escalatory [measures
**short of war**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to signal resolve and impose
costs]{.underline} on Taiwan, including military, economic, and
diplomatic efforts to squeeze the island and deter it from pulling away
from the mainland. Behavior of this sort should not be mistaken for
preparations for war. KEEP CALM In any society, there are people who go
looking for a fight. But [among the ranks of China's top leaders, those
people still appear to be **less influential**]{.underline} than those
who recognize that it is better to win without fighting. Although Xi
warned in 2021 that China would take "decisive measures" if provoked by
"forces for Taiwan independence," the CCP reiterated in 2022 that
"peaceful reunification" remains its "first choice." [Even the hawkish
Qiao Liang]{.underline}, a retired major general in the Chinese air
force, [has cautioned against the tide of nationalist agitation for
action against Taiwan]{.underline}. "China's ultimate goal is not the
reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national
rejuvenation---so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,"
Qiao said in a May 2020 interview. He went on to warn that taking Taiwan
by force would be "too costly" and should not be Beijing's top priority.

#### Experts conclude we are years away

U.S. Navy admiral, former supreme allied commander of NATO, and dean

University, he is vice chairman of global affairs at the Carlyle
Group. "A US-China War Over Taiwan Isn\'t Happening Anytime Soon",

08-09-2022

[[Based on]{.mark} many [**years** of **engagement**]{.mark} with the
**Chinese** around the Pacific both [**operationally** and
**diplomatically**]{.mark}]{.underline}, I believe [[we are **years
away** from]{.mark} any potential [**military move** by Beijing against
Taipei]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it is particularly
[**unlikely** to happen]{.mark} in the immediate future.]{.underline}
There are several reasons.

First, [events in [Ukraine]{.mark} are **likely** to [give]{.mark}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping **[pause]{.mark}**, not
encouragement]{.underline}. He must be asking himself, "I wonder if my
generals and admirals are as bad as those Russians appear to be?" Xi was
probably assured by Putin, when they met at the Olympics in February,
that this would be a sharp, short war and that the Russians would have
full control of Ukraine before the West could get its collective boots
on. Things turned out very differently for the Kremlin.

[The [Chinese **military**]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar in many ways to
Russia's, [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} even the level of [**[combat
experience]{.mark}** the [Russians had]{.mark} in Afghanistan, Chechnya
and Syria]{.underline}, and in the previous invasions of Ukraine and
Georgia.

A second reason for Chinese hesitancy is [[uncertainty about the
**Taiwanese**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Would they [**fold** or
**fight**?]{.underline} [Polling is never fully **reliable**, but [all
**indications**]{.mark} are that the **[Taiwan]{.mark}**ese have a
strong **sense** of national **identity** [and are unlikely to simply
**roll over**]{.mark} when the first wave of Chinese missiles strike on
the island]{.underline}. (Beijing gave a preview of its muscle in
the [exercises](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-09/(previewed%20this%20past%20weekend%20in%20the%20exercises%20responding%20to%20the%20Pelosi%20visit)) responding
to the Pelosi visit.)

President Tsai Ing-wen is a steely leader --- she's not unlike Ukrainian
leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy --- and my assessment is that the Taiwanese
will fight, and fight hard. The geography of the island --- mountain and
forest --- is a nightmare for an invader, especially one that must mount
the assault by sea.

Third, [Beijing is watching the [**alignment** of]{.mark} the **[Western
democracies]{.mark}** across Europe]{.underline} and the Far East in
enacting ~~crippling~~ sanctions on Russia, [[causing Moscow
to **default**]{.mark} on its debt for the first time in more than a
century]{.underline}. Almost all Western
corporations [decamped](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/22/russia-economy-sanctions-myths-ruble-business/) from
Moscow, helping cause a collapse in imports, and few look to be going
back anytime soon. The NordStream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany
will have nothing but air whistling through its long tubes for the
foreseeable future, and the Europeans are making strides toward [energy
independence](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/world/europe/russia-gas-cuts-putin-eu.html) from
Moscow.

Sure, the Chinese will say to themselves, our economy is too big to
sanction, and they would be largely correct. But could the West produce
real pain-inducing sanctions on specific sectors? Absolutely. And at a
moment when the Chinese economy has been slowed by the ravages of
zero-Covid lockdowns, this prospect is particularly unappetizing.

Fourth, as the old saw goes, "all politics are local," and [[Xi has
a]{.mark} very [**delicate political** situation]{.mark} before
him]{.underline}. At the 20th Communist Party Congress late in the fall,
he will almost certainly be given a third five-year term. It is a
remarkable achievement, vaulting him into the company of Mao Zedong and
Deng Xiaoping. [He [does not want a]{.mark} major [conflict]{.mark} with
the US [to interfere with this **anointment**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even
[after he]{.mark} fully [consolidates control]{.mark} it seems
[**unlikely** he **would**]{.mark} quickly **manufacture** a crisis that
could **[crater the global economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Finally, [China's **military** and **political** [leaders]{.mark}
probably **assess** that they [are not]{.mark} (quite) [ready]{.mark}
for a full-scale war with the US.]{.underline} They have a [[**backlog**
of military **capability**]{.mark} they will want [to]{.mark} fully
[integrate]{.mark} into the **P**eople's **L**iberation
**A**rmy]{.underline}: a new strategic nuclear force, nuclear-powered
warships (notably aircraft carriers), hypersonic missiles, improved
offensive cyberwarfare techniques, and a far better satellite network
for reconnaissance and actual combat in space.

#### Ukraine shows invasions are difficult for Beijing

**Chung 22'** -- Lawrence, covers major news in Taiwan, ranging from
presidential and parliament elections to killer earthquakes and
typhoons. Most of his reports focus on Taiwan's relations with China,
specifically on the impact and possible developments of cross-strait
relations under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and
mainland-friendly Kuomintang governments. Before starting work at the
South China Morning Post in 2006, he wrote for Reuters and AFP for more

The [[head
of [Taiwan's](https://www.scmp.com/topics/taiwan-0?module=inline&pgtype=article) **National
Security Bureau**]{.underline}]{.mark} said the [[Russian
**experience**]{.mark} in Ukraine]{.underline} has [[made it unlikely
that **Beijing** will send **forces** to the]{.mark} **self-ruled
[island]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the remainder of President Tsai
Ing-wen's term.

But Chen Ming-tong warned legislators that the island must not let down
its guard, because any attack from the mainland would be an all-out
operation.

Chen was [responding to **questions** during Monday's legislature
**session** on whether the **P**eople's **L**iberation **A**rmy would
follow **Russia's lead**
in [Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine?module=inline&pgtype=article) to
attack Taiwan]{.underline}.

Beijing, [which considers the **island** as part of its
**territory**,]{.underline} has been ramping up pressure on the island
since Tsai refused to accept the one-China principle. Warplanes fly
towards Taiwan almost daily and PLA exercises have been staged near the
island.

Wen Yu-hsia, from the main Taiwanese opposition party the Kuomintang
(KMT), asked Chen to evaluate the chances of an attack, adding that
"even the US Indo-Pacific commander does not rule out the possibility".

Wen was referring to an interview with Admiral [John
Aquilino](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3171203/china-has-fully-militarised-islands-south-china-sea-threatening?module=inline&pgtype=article) published
by the Financial Times on Friday, in which he said the Russian invasion
of Ukraine showed Asian nations must take the possibility of a PLA
attack on Taiwan seriously.

Aquilino said he was concerned about Beijing's increasing pressure on
the island, and the need to be prepared for any eventuality. "[As of
five months ago, nobody would have **predicted** the war in **Ukraine**,
and the number one lesson from it should be that anything could
happen]{.underline}."

But Chen [said [Beijing had]{.mark} definitely [**learned** from
**Russia's experience** and would not]{.mark} "**[rashly]{.mark}**"
[send **forces** to **Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan and it has
long been an open plot for it to unify Taiwan ever since 1949," he said,
referring to the end of the civil war, when KMT forces fled to the
island in defeat.

Chen said the Ukraine war had certainly allowed the Communist Party to
understand it should not make any move without careful consideration --
and once it decided to strike, it must be an all-out operation.

He said [Russia had made a lot of **mistakes**, which included starting
its **invasion** without an **organised plan**]{.underline}, and that
Beijing would do all it could to avoid making the same errors if it
chose to attack the island

[I can tell [in the **next three years**]{.mark} of the remaining tenure
of President Tsai, [**Beijing** is unlikely to send **forces to attack
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said, adding his assessment was made
from his professional viewpoint.

"But we must not relax our vigilance and must be well prepared
militarily and once they attack us we must counter-attack. We are not a
limp chicken doing nothing."

Expanding on what other lessons had been learned from the war, Chen said
Beijing had been surprised at the success of international sanctions,
including taking Russia out of the Swift banking system, pushed through
with the support of Western allies.

"[Beijing \[will be\] more **cautious** in making any move \[against
Taiwan\] as evidenced by the intervention of **foreign forces** in the
Ukraine war]{.underline}," he said.

He noted that while the US did not send forces to help Ukraine -- for
fear of triggering a third world war -- its other military and monetary
aid was another restraint on the movements of Russian troops.

Chen said the [US **decision** to help Ukraine was **made** without the
domestic legal requirement that **underpinned** Washington's
**commitment**]{.underline} to ensure Taiwan's defence capability
against Beijing.

"[We have [the **T**]{.mark}aiwan **[R]{.mark}**elations
**[A]{.mark}**ct which \[US President Joe\] Biden has used to
consolidate ties with us, and this [would make Beijing think carefully
before sending forces to attack]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline}," he noted.

**[A THUCYDIDES' TRAP?]{.underline}**

The [most widely discussed contemporary work]{.underline} using
Thucydides as a guide for twenty-first century grand strategy [is Graham
Allison's Destined for War]{.underline}: Can America and China Escape
Thucydides' Trap?5 Like [power transition theorists]{.underline},
Allison [regards]{.underline} the [[**decline** of]{.mark} existing
hegemonic [powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the rise of new ones [as a
major [source of]{.mark} **great power conflict** and
**[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline}6 Indeed, by his calculation, in three
quarters of such cases rising and declining great powers became
entrapped in war.7 [It is not surprising Allison and others would look
to the Peloponnesian War because here is **[ev]{.mark}**idence that
another power transition is going on with [China]{.mark}
"**[rising]{.mark}**" [relative to the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates in many direct and latent indicators of national
power.]{.underline}8 [China]{.underline}, once a hierarchical power in
East Asia, [seems bent on reestablishing something like that
today]{.underline}.9 How would Thucydides recommend that the United
States respond?

[As **China** rises and **narrows** the relative power advantage of the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, Thucydides offers insights into how
the United States should respond. [A careful reading of **[Thucydides
suggests]{.mark}** that a [balance]{.mark}, rather than **trying** to
maintain preponderance, should be **sufficient** to **protect** U.S.
interests.]{.underline}

[Criticism of Allison's take on Thucydides has become **something** of a
**cottage** industry]{.underline}. Not all Western scholars would go so
far as Jonathan Kirshner in dismissing Destined for War out of hand as
"sloppy, superficial, oversimplified, overconfident, and repetitive,"
but it is fair to say many found much wanting in the book.10 [Nor have
[Chinese leaders]{.mark} or scholars found the analogy between the great
war between Athens and Sparta [and]{.mark} the twenty-first century
U.S.-China rivalry useful]{.underline}, save perhaps as an indicator of
how America views their rise. [Chinese President **[Xi]{.mark} Jinping**
categorically [**denied** there is any]{.mark} "such thing [as]{.mark}
the so-called **[Thucydides trap]{.mark}** in the world."]{.underline}11
The majority of [Chinese scholars "**reject** the so-called **metaphor**
from history]{.underline} and regard this simplistic historical analogy
as the newest version of the longstanding 'China Threat Theory.'"12
China Threat Theory is an umbrella under which a number of arguments
come together about why China's rise is not likely to be peaceful.13 Not
to pile on, but Allison's use of Thucydides is muddled. Allison himself
puts this slightly differently: He admits he holds "two contradictory
ideas in \[his\] head at the same time."14 Either way, Allison is not
clear on some important points as to how we ought to think about the
U.S.-China rivalry through Thucydides' lens.

A TRAP OR A CHOICE?

For instance, he is equivocal about what he means by a "trap." In some
places he suggests "destiny" is not "inevitability," and smart
leadership can avoid this geopolitical snare.15 But in other places,
Allison notes the trap defied "the ancient world's two most fabled
powers" leaders' efforts to "avoid" war. Elsewhere, he adds the
Thucydides trap "create\[s\] a dynamic that is extremely difficult to
manage successfully."16 If not "inevitable," war between the United
States and China is highly probable given his on gloss the history of
great power conflict.17 Indeed, in his assessment of 500 years of the
rise and fall of great powers he calculates 75 percent of the time
rising and declining powers come to blows.18 Given that, it is not
surprising the title of his book is Destined for War.

Allison's muddle on this issue may in part reflect the debate among
scholars and translators about Thucydides' own views of the
"inevitability" of the great war between Athens and Sparta. The famous
Crawley translation of section 1.23.6 translates Thucydides as declaring
"the growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in
Sparta, made war inevitable (emphasis added)."19 Other translations,
though, are far less determinative. Jeremy Mynott, for example,
translates Thucydides as suggesting "the Athenians were becoming
powerful and inspired fear in the Spartans and so forced them into
war."19 I agree, therefore, with Arthur M. Eckstein that Thucydides did
not mean the war is "inevitable" absent decisions of the leaders of
Sparta and especially Athens, so the widely used Richard Crawley
translation is misleading on this score.20 Arlene Saxenhouse concedes
there is what she calls a "power trap" in Thucydides---fear makes the
powerful pursue yet more power to counter the power-seeking of others,
resulting in a spiral of conflict---but notes neither Thucydides nor his
hero Pericles thought all-out, catastrophic war was inevitable.22
Indeed, in his famous eulogy for Pericles in Book II, Thucydides praises
Pericles' strategic prudence and deplores the lack of it among his
successors, thereby suggesting a major role for choice.23

Relatedly, in some places, Allison seems to advocate some elements of a
Balance of Power-type strategy as means to avert U.S.-China conflict;
but elsewhere in the book he indicts realpolitik as part of the problem,
associating it with the later Athenian thesis at Melos---"the strong do
what they can and the weak suffer what they must"24---and perhaps tying
it to those contemporary analysts who think that the way the U.S. should
respond to the rise of China is to keep it down.25 Given that, the
balance of power realist case for how to deal with a rising China still
remains to be made.

U.S. GRAND STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR TODAY

What are the strategic choices available to the United States to deal
with the rise of China? There are essentially two: One approach, which
is widely embraced within the U.S. government and endorsed by many
pundits and scholars, is that the way to avoid hegemonic war is to avert
power transition altogether by maintaining U.S. dominance. Indeed, the
notion we need to contain or otherwise stay ahead of China dominates
much official thinking in Washington, DC. This could be done
unilaterally by simply staying as far ahead of the Chinese as possible
in terms of both direct and latent indices of power. This is the power
maximization of grand strategies like \"primacy.\"26 However, the more
widely embraced strategy for maintaining U.S. hegemony these days is to
emphasize its collective benefits and constrain its power through
international institutions. Both \"deep engagement\" (the forward
deployment of U.S. power to directly manage the international system)
and \"liberal internationalism\" (the use of international institutions
by the United States to do so) employ versions of this argument.27

The other approach would set more realistic goals for the United States
in response to the rise of China: work to maintain a balance of power.
This choice, in turn, hinges on a central issue in international
relations theory: Is a concentration of power the natural equilibrium,
hence it is the case that great powers, and perhaps lesser powers,
should seek hegemony? Or is a balance of power the best situation and
the most that great powers can reasonably aspire to and maintain?28 The
"balance of power" refers to an equilibrium of peace between states or
groups of them maintained by the military policies of each side.29 The
latter is the lesson readers should take away from Thucydides' chronicle
of the great war between Athens and Sparta.

LIBERAL HEGEMONY/PRIMACY VS. BALANCE OF POWER/RESTRAINT

![A screenshot of a black screen Description automatically
generated](media/image3.png){width="6.0in"
height="1.5493055555555555in"}

A careful reading of Thucydides shows that he inclines toward the latter
view. Power maximization strategies are unsustainable because they tempt
powerful states to overreach, as Athens did in Sicily in Books VI and
VII. Given that propensity, other actors will balance against it, as do
Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian League in Book I, the
Sicilian Greek colonies in Books VI and VII, and dissatisfied members of
the Athenian empire in Book VIII. Thucydides is also skeptical that
benign hegemony is a stable situation long-term. Athens, which led the
Greeks against the Persians and founded the Delian League as a voluntary
alliance, soon gave way to the tyranny that reached its nadir at the
Melian Dialogue in Book V. Given that, Thucydides' message, while not
identical to a restrained balance of power realism, seems most
compatible with it.30

Such a reading of Thucydides suggests U.S. efforts to maintain its
hegemonic position, either unilaterally or through popular consent, are
bound to fail.31 The post-Cold War "unipolar moment" is an artifact of
the sudden and unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar system. By
virtue of its large population and high level of economic growth, China
is soon to replace the Soviet Union as another pole in the twenty-first
century international system. The interesting question now is not how
much longer unipolarity will last but whether it will be replaced with a
bipolar or multipolar system. And if it in fact turns out to be bipolar,
why would not structural theory lead us to see how it might be
stable---defined in terms of the absence of great power war---in the
same way the Cold War was?32

SHARE OF GLOBAL GDP (MER)

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically

[The U.S. commanded an outsized **share** of the **global economy**
after World War II, but in recent years, China's rise has moved its
economy closer to **parity**.]{.underline}

One of [the most important causes of hegemonic **wars** in]{.underline}
the [wake of power transitions is the "**security
dilemma**]{.underline}," the ubiquitous yet unintended dynamic in which
the efforts one state takes to ensure its security invariably undermine
that of other states.33 [While in an anarchical international system,
the [security dilemma can]{.mark} **never be eliminated**]{.underline},
it [can [be **mitigated**]{.mark} in many cases]{.underline} by the
policies states embrace. Thucydides thinks the Peloponnesian War results
from the breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta and
he applauds Pericles' efforts to try to reestablish it through
restraint.

HOW TO BALANCE THE DRAGON

Not only is [a **[balance of power]{.mark}**
strategy]{.underline}---like offshore balancing or restraint---[less
likely to **exacerbate** the **security dilemma**]{.underline}, [it
[is]{.mark} **eminently** more [**feasible** and]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
better [serve American **security**]{.mark} and prosperity
**interests**.]{.underline} Both offshore balancing and restraint are
based upon balance of power theories of international relations. Where
they differ is on the specific values of the variables in the strategic
equation (does current technology favor offense or defense, the specific
geography involved, the strength of the adversary, and the capabilities
of the other members of the balancing coalition?) that would lead us to
think the United States, or any other hegemon, needs to take a more or
less active role in balancing or whether they can rely more on the
efforts of the other states in its coalition.34

As Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War suggests, a balance of
power approach by the United States in its contemporary rivalry with
China will be more effective and less destabilizing. [The key **reason**
it will do so is [it **builds** upon]{.mark} a number of
well-established facts about how **[international politics]{.mark}
operates**, which we have known for more than **2,500
years**.]{.underline}35 First, in most cases, [states balance against
**threats**, rather than **bandwagoning**,]{.underline}\--throwing their
lot in with a stronger state in hopes that fealty rather than military
capability will preserve their security.36 [[As China grows more
**powerful**]{.mark} and **assertive**, states closest to it are feeling
a greater sense of peril.]{.underline} [Their [response will be]{.mark}
to seek ways to mitigate that threat by **[counterbalancing]{.mark}**
it, particularly in concert with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.
A less forward and assertive U.S. posture will not only mitigate the
security dilemma with China but also dampen common pathologies of
balancing such as buck-passing by allies to the larger power and
otherwise under-providing for their own security. The common problem
behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the propensity of
actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them against its
consequences.37

GEOGRAPHICAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHINA'S MARITIME POWER

![A map of the world Description automatically

height="3.7784722222222222in"}

To China's east, the first and second island chains, formed by the
various islands of the East and South China Seas, create natural
bottlenecks and hamper China's ability to project power across the
Pacific. Likewise, the Himalayas, combined with the nuclear capabilities
of China's neighbors, impacts China's reach into South Asia.

Second, **[[geography matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While power
degrades as a function of distance it also is diluted by **dense
forests**, high **mountain ranges**, and especially **wide bodies of
water**.]{.underline}38 The **[U.S.-China
[rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in contrast to the Cold War with the
Soviet Union, [[will be waged across]{.mark} wide
**[moats]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than contiguous borders, [so it
is even [less likely to **deteriorate** into]{.mark} **hegemonic
[war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Taiwan, for example, is further from
mainland China than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about
the same distance Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these
relatively short distances, neither was ever successfully invaded.

Third, it is true the United States opened a considerable gap in nuclear
capability between itself and other major nuclear powers, such as Russia
and especially China, that leads some to believe that the United States
could fight and win a nuclear war, especially with the latter.39 But
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} that both the United States and China have
[substantial [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Nuclear
Revolution [should]{.underline} further [**[reduce]{.mark}** the
[chances]{.mark} of major war]{.underline} between them, in much the
same way it kept the Cold War from turning hot.40 Indeed, [even when the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates had an even **greater nuclear
advantage** over the Soviet Union]{.underline} than it has over China
today, and in the face of multiple serious crises, [it neve[r
**executed** a pre-emptive]{.mark} nuclear first
**[strike]{.mark}**.]{.underline}41

Fourth, states' strategic choices matter, particularly in how they
choose to arm themselves, and that will continue to be true in the
twenty-first century. Many fret that recent Chinese investments in
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) technologies make it harder for the
United States to continue to project power close to China. However,
these same technologies could also bolster America's beleaguered allies
in the region.42 To defeat them militarily, China will have to project
power across water, always a dicey proposition, but one made even harder
now if U.S. allies in the region invest in their own A2/AD technologies.

Finally, and most important, we should keep in mind that
[[despite]{.mark} the power [transition]{.mark} that is taking place,
the United States still wields **considerable** actual and latent
**power** compared to China. ]{.underline}43 Even if it is challenged in
the East Asian region, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
nonetheless [retains]{.mark} what Barry Posen calls "the **[command of
the commons]{.mark}**" globally.44]{.underline}

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates desperately [needs to plan for a
**long war in the Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} **region**]{.underline}.

A troubling gap exists between US industrial capacity and the production
requirements to sustain and win a war with China. While such assessments
generally focus on shipbuilding due to the maritime focus of conflict
scenarios, the same disparity exists in military platforms across all
domains of warfare, such as aircraft, armor, ground-based air defense
systems, and others. Defense analysis on these myriad gaps is abundant,
but most evaluations are piecemeal in nature, focusing only on a single
platform or domain, rather than taking a holistic approach to the
problem.

This disjointed assessment is compounded by the lack of a rigorous
analysis of the wartime manpower requirements to operate new platforms.
Producing the ships, aircraft, and fighting vehicles to sustain a war
against China---which would almost certainly be protracted---isn't
enough. The platforms must also be manned and supported. A guided
missile destroyer, for example, requires a crew of more than three
hundred sailors. A single squadron of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters
requires hundreds of maintainers, air controllers, fuelers, and other
support personnel to remain operational. And while opening phases of a
war with China would predominantly be an air and maritime fight
involving ships, aircraft, and precision munitions, a long conflict
fought for years would likely require nearly one hundred divisions of
ground and amphibious forces from the US Army and Marine Corps.

Generating the personnel to man such a force would almost certainly
require a draft---and getting the numbers right is itself a complex
challenge that demands a delicate touch. The skill sets required for the
force must be balanced against the domestic workforce's nonmilitary
needs. Skilled laborers and trained knowledge workers will be needed in
abundance to sustain the production of a US war machine. In short,
properly planning a national mobilization for a long war with China is a
daunting task that has not yet been engaged in detail by the national
security community. Developing even a "plan to plan" for mobilization
can be overwhelming. Where should analysts start? Thankfully, history
provides a road map.

Lessons forged in war

In the final months leading up to the United States' involvement in
World War II, senior US policymakers noted a similar disparity between
military-industrial capacity and the requirements to mobilize the nation
for a war with Germany. After identifying US objectives in such a war
and the combat power of the enemy, planners calculated the number of US
combat divisions required to fight and win. This, in turn, enabled
estimates of matériel production and the skilled laborers needed for
military manufacturing. Comparing this to existing, peacetime US
industry, its labor force, and its draftable population, a program was
written for scaling up production while executing a military draft. The
result was the Victory Program, which forecasted the military forces,
their missions, and matériel requirements the United States would need
to defeat Germany with uncanny precision.

Quite simply, the United States needs a modern victory plan for a war
against China in the Indo-Pacific. Like its predecessor, this plan must
account for all requirements to win a protracted war and tap into all
forms of power available to the United States. For this plan to serve as
an effective deterrent, the plan and its rigor should be clearly
communicated to key leaders within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
While the scope of such a document would be wide and deep, the following
considerations are essential.

Good strategy starts with clear objectives

With the WWII Victory Program, lead planners first took care to
determine the nature of the problem they were trying to solve. This
enabled the identification of a national policy objective, facilitating
the development of an appropriate military strategy. It was only then
that planners were postured to estimate the military forces needed to
pursue that strategy and reach the determined objective. The Victory
Program took as its core assumption that US policy, should it be pulled
into the war, would be to eliminate totalitarianism from Europe and deny
imperial Japan control of the western Pacific. All other planning flowed
to support this core objective and anticipated US participation in a
long, global conflict.

In planning for a long war with China, US planners must frame the
problem appropriately. Too often, national security practitioners frame
war-games and exercises as short, decisive conflicts focused primarily
around Taiwan and in the "first island chain." But [[wars between
**great powers** are rarely **short**]{.mark} affairs and instead tend
to expand horizontally while grinding on for **years**. The hot wars
raging today in Ukraine and the Middle East bear testament to this
brutal reality]{.underline}.

As such, [a victory plan for a war against China demands framing the
problem in terms of a **global war**, with **several theaters** and
**multiple adversaries**, focused on destroying the military
capabilities of the CCP and its cobelligerents wherever they may be
encountered]{.underline}. The Victory Program was careful to consider
the "potential enemies" of the United States in its calculations, and a
modern victory plan must similarly consider horizontal escalation and
simultaneous fights against forces from Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

Sea power is essential---but not sufficient

The Victory Program was focused on building the army that the United
States would need, and it consequently assessed the number and types of
US Army divisions needed to fight per the plan's strategy. This task was
also scoped in terms of three key missions, described as hemispheric
defense, defending outlying possessions, and overseas task forces. An
Indo-Pacific victory plan would similarly need to identify the right
forces for the right missions.

While defeating the CCP's island-landing campaign against Taiwan will be
one mission, hemispheric defense, regional air defense, theater
sustainment, and other global missions will also inform US force
structure. Premier naval and amphibious forces will certainly be
required as more regionally focused war-games suggest, but the military
will also need forces capable of achieving dominance in all domains and
against other probable enemies of the United States.

At the same time, the types of forces and platforms needed will shift
depending on the phase of the war, enemy action, and the level of
support from allies and partners. For example, missile defense will see
more demand so long as the enemy maintains robust long-range strike
capabilities, but this may change if the enemy's precision munitions
begin to dwindle and its ability to replenish its magazines is denied.
Similarly, naval forces might be the nation's priority at the beginning
of the war, but ground forces that can seize, hold, and defend terrain
may become a greater requirement later in the war.

Achieving economic and industrial balance

Generating such forces doesn't just happen. In preparation for World War
II, a balance had to be sought to avoid undercutting the industrial and
farming base to keep the nation in the fight and on its feet, while also
conducting a draft of unprecedented scale to fill out the formations
needed to win. Notably, the first round of this draft occurred well
before the United States was itself involved in the hostilities raging
in Europe and the Pacific.

Similarly, the formations required for an Indo-Pacific victory plan
could only be filled by a large draft. Additionally, the warfighting
platforms, munitions, and other matériel needed for a protracted
struggle can only be produced by an informational and industrial base
manned by a critical mass of skilled workers. This poses the risk that
indiscriminate drafting could strip the work force of the skilled
workers essential to matérial production.

Planners must identify the key industrial bases the government needs to
mobilize and in turn determine which skilled workers should be retained
to support these bases, to avoid impairing US war-making potential.
Deliberate thought must be put into determining whether an individual is
more valuable to the war effort with a rifle in hand or on the
production line for munitions, ships, aircraft, and other essential
matérial.

Open discourse as a deterrent

[[While]{.mark} such [a planning effort is critical should a war occur,
it offers its greatest **deterrent** value if the CCP is **aware** of
its existence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The gaps in US readiness for a protracted war are many, known, and
widely discussed within US policy circles. While such open discourse is
a key strength of the US system and enables more honest assessments of
gaps and in turn a path for improvement, it could also exaggerate CCP
assessments of its own capability and will vis-à-vis the United States.
Put another way, the frequent and grim [[assessments by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [of its]{.mark}]{.underline} warfighting
[[shortfalls could]{.mark} feed into China's own campaign of public
opinion warfare, and [inflate China's **confidence** in its ability to
**win**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **deterrent effect** of any capability or redline is muted if the
adversary is ignorant of its existence. [The rigor and utility of
a]{.mark} new [US]{.mark} victory [plan for the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}
region [should]{.mark} not [be]{.mark} a hand of cards held close to the
vest, but [**laid out** on the table to demonstrate US resolve and
**long-term commitment**]{.mark} to such a struggle should it break out.
In this way, [the plan]{.mark} could help [tip the scales of deterrence
and **prevent** such a war from **breaking out at
all**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Writing the victory plan

The US national security establishment remains focused on planning for a
short, sharp war with China conducted around Taiwan in the first island
chain. But such a war between two great powers, like so many before,
will almost certainly become a long war of attrition. In planning for
such a conflict, the United States needs a new victory plan. In writing
this, planners should look to the Victory Program of World War II as a
model. This process began with problem framing at the global scale,
enabled estimates of the forces needed to win, and maintained the
industrial base and work force needed for matériel production. In
following this process, the United States could develop a credible plan
to win a protracted war in the Indo-Pacific region. [And in
[**strategically communicating** this plan]{.mark} to China, the United
States may **[prevent]{.mark} such [a catastrophic war from
occurring]{.mark}** in the first place]{.underline}.

Taiwan

[[Taiwan is]{.mark} probably [the most frequently cited]{.mark}
potential [**flashpoint** between **China and the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline}.74 [[A range of triggers could prompt a
crisis]{.mark} in or around the Taiwan Strait, including a unilateral
declaration of independence from Taipei]{.underline} (fairly unlikely to
happen), [or [a decision by **Beijing** to ratchet up
**military**]{.mark}, economic and political **[pressure]{.mark}**
(including interference) [on]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} even [to
**invade**]{.mark}, [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some analysis of
those possibilities has tended towards alarmism (given just how
difficult and costly an invasion of Taiwan would be),75 [war over Taiwan
remains a real possibility]{.underline}.

A direct attack against Taiwan would be a dramatically escalatory first
move from China. [Were [China]{.mark} seeking to invade and occupy
Taiwan, it [would]{.mark} need to [launch]{.mark} extensive and
overwhelming [**preliminary strikes** to facilitate access for
**amphibious transports**]{.mark} and major surface
vessels]{.underline}. We could expect cyberattacks on
command-and-control infrastructure and potential antisatellite attacks
(using either physical or cyber means). Those attacks may extend to US
systems, or even to US forces based in the region.76

[The US might respond to a direct Chinese attack on Taiwan in several
ways. The US's resolve to oppose the invasion directly would be stronger
were US forces, systems or its homeland targeted, but it's possible that
[the US]{.mark} might **[intervene militarily]{.mark}** even [if China
directed its initial campaign **only against
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, the US has sought to
maintain ambiguity about this calculation. Broadly speaking, a direct US
military response would involve US maritime forces manoeuvring in the
Western Pacific and striking Chinese capabilities, employing some
version of DMO. Such a direct US response has been critiqued as being,
in turn, highly escalatory because it's likely to be operationally
necessary for US strikes on Chinese capabilities (for example, on
mainland-based command-and-control architecture, missile launch sites
and so on) required to establish and maintain American freedom of
manoeuvre.77

Crisis scenarios

[There are **three key sources of potential crisis** in the Western
Pacific that could involve both the **US and China** in a conflict: the
**Korean Peninsula**; **Taiwan**; and a militarised **dispute between
China** and another claimant state in either the **South or the East
China Sea**]{.underline}. This is far from an exhaustive list, and other
flashpoints, such as the China--India border, bear noting.65

This threefold formulation bears resemblance to Canberra-based strategic
studies academic Brendan Taylor's The four flashpoints, which remains an
excellent primer on regional risks from a political perspective. I don't
discuss the details of East and South China Sea politics and
capabilities in any depth in this report. Taylor's work is also
instructive in referring to the late and well-known Australian scholar
Coral Bell's idea of a 'crisis slide',66 which is important because
those potential flashpoints are deeply interrelated. To paraphrase Coral
Bell, crises may well come not as discrete 'boulders' but instead as a
crumbling mountainside.67

Below, I outline these potential sources of crisis, then provide a
schematic list of the thresholds that might be involved in escalation.
Finally, I suggest some broad ways that Australian decision-makers might
consider contributing militarily to those scenarios, highlighting the
relevance of such responses to the trajectory of a given crisis.

The Korean Peninsula

[[A]{.mark} very serious [crisis centred on **North Korea** remains
a]{.mark} real [possibility]{.mark}. The drivers [could come from
**within**]{.mark} North Korea, [through **international tension**, or
some **combination**]{.mark} of both]{.underline}.

In 2015, Peter Varghese, while Secretary of the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, speculated that [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [might
**collapse**]{.mark} under the weight of its own economic gravity and
contemplated the future of the Korean Peninsula in terms of **when**,
rather than whether, **reunification** will occur]{.underline}.68 [[Even
if]{.mark} the North Korean regime [doesn't]{.mark} collapse, [there's
potential for a **succession crisis**]{.mark} within the regime, in
which the alignment and conduct of the military could be
crucial]{.underline}.69

Domestic instability in North Korea would pose a range of problems for
the international community. [The safety of **North Korean nuclear
weapons** would be a **pre-eminent concern**]{.underline}.70 [[A]{.mark}
large-scale **[humanitarian catastrophe]{.mark}**, which [could drive
**migrants** across the **Chinese border**]{.mark}, would be another
concern]{.underline}, and the regional and international community would
need to be mindful of Beijing's equities in how the crisis were handled.
[The [US, So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rean [and Chinese militaries
would]{.mark} probably need to [be involved in managing]{.mark} such
eventualities [and]{.mark} could potentially be [acting in **close
proximately**]{.mark} to each other [inside No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea
in the event of a regime collapse. In such situations, the [**potential
for misunderstanding** resulting in]{.mark} either [**accidental
escalation** or **pressure to pre-empt**]{.mark} could be very
real]{.underline}.

[[A crisis]{.mark} on the Korean Peninsula [could]{.mark} also [be more
**immediately international**]{.mark} rather than domestic. For
instance, the [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean regime [might
**miscalculate** the **tolerance** of a]{.mark} future [US
admin]{.mark}istration [for **nuclear brinksmanship**, or]{.mark} a
[US]{.mark} administration might **[miscalculate the regime's]{.mark}
own [thresholds]{.mark}**]{.underline}.71 [Some research suggests that
the North Korean regime consistently responds to US -- South Korea joint
military exercises as a serious security threat, not mere theatre,
providing a **regular basis for miscalculation**]{.underline}.72 And
there's [plentiful space for **accidents**]{.underline} with tragic
outcomes, including involving third countries. For instance, [[a]{.mark}
North Korean [**missile test** over Japan could **misfire** and hit a
populated area, **dramatically escalating
tensions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whatever its cause, [[a crisis]{.mark}
on the Korean Peninsula [would]{.mark} almost certainly [involve]{.mark}
both [the **US and China**]{.mark}. Any crisis or conflict could
[involve heavy fighting]{.mark}, potentially [including the use of
**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}, close to the Chinese border]{.underline}.
The need to avoid inadvertent or accidental escalation with China
because of allied actions on the peninsula would clearly be a
pre-eminent concern.

Uncertainty and the maritime domain

The first reason for concern is the nature of the Indo-Pacific, and
specially the Western Pacific. Most thinking on crisis stability and
deterrence has focused on the Cold War confrontation between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact along a European land border and the associated contours
of the US--USSR nuclear relationship. But [[the Indo-Pacific is]{.mark}
principally [a **maritime theatre**]{.mark}. [It's been argued
that]{.mark} the [maritime domain]{.mark} may be [**less prone**
to]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation and]{.mark} disastrous
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Ships are inherently mobile, and
when they withdraw from a confrontation that doesn't ipso facto
represent the ceding of ground, making a backdown more politically
palatable.26 Another example is submarine deployment, which is something
rarely publicly signalled and therefore withdrawable without loss of
face. In other words, a level of ambiguity about forces in the maritime
domain, or an ability to shift intent and narrative or maintain
deniability, may offer opportunities for maintaining stability.

But [those same **attributes** of the maritime domain could also be
interpreted as reasons for concern.]{.underline} To begin with,
**[[offence--defence distinguishability is very low at
sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**.27 For instance, the Washington Conference in
1921--22, which was an attempt by the major powers to limit the naval
arms race, struggled to define offensive capability. [The vertical
launching system (**[VLS]{.mark}**) [ubiquitous on **Western
warships**]{.mark} is a prime contemporary example of this
problem]{.underline}. [[An adversary doesn't know whether VLS cells
contain **anti-air missiles for self-defence**]{.mark}, [**land-attack
missiles** for long-range strike, or]{.mark} the
**[next-gen]{.mark}eration** stealthy [anti-ship missile]{.mark}
currently under development]{.underline} for the US military.
[**[Sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}** [and the contents of their magazines
pose a similar problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And some analysts have noted that ['modern [warships have **glass
jaws**]{.mark}']{.underline}---that is, [they're vulnerable, if not to
sinking, then to being [put out of action by]{.mark} even [a
**single**]{.mark} missile or torpedo [hit]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 [This
arguably leads to a dynamic in which 'whichever side completes the
targeting chain first and fires first almost **always wins**', and
[creates a **powerful incentive to pre-empt**]{.mark}]{.underline}.29 In
other words, ships that can be discovered are very vulnerable. [There
can, [therefore]{.mark}, be [a **major advantage in shooting
first**]{.mark}]{.underline} when conflict seems imminent. [This
suggests the potential for [maritime scenarios]{.mark} in which
[**escalation pressures** are **very strong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The longstanding [naval preoccupation with **presence** can]{.mark}
also [be read as]{.mark} the **[capacity to act with little
warning]{.mark}**, and sea power has specific characteristics that
[produce **uncertainty and ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.30

A militarised dispute in the Western Pacific

[[A]{.mark} crisis or [conflict could start between **China** and one of
the countries]{.mark} with which [it has a **sovereignty
dispute**]{.mark} in the Western Pacific, [such as **Japan**]{.mark},
[the **Philippines**]{.mark} or Vietnam]{.underline}. [[That could
**involve the US**]{.mark} if Washington intervenes to support China's
adversary (note that [it has **security treaties**]{.mark} **with Japan
and the Philippines**)]{.underline}.82

[China's expansion in the East and South China seas is about more than
just the disputed features. Some sovereignty claims engage **natural
resources** and **military access**]{.underline}, and China may be
attempting to create a so-called 'bastion' to defend its
ballistic-missile submarines.83 The occupation of islands and features
provides potential military advantages but also engages wider interests
in national influence and sovereignty.

Brendan Taylor's work provides a useful summary of the different risks
present in the East and South China seas. He argues that the East China
Sea and the China--Japan relationship are of greater concern than the
well-covered tensions in the South China Sea. That assessment reflects
domestic politics in China and Japan, clearer US commitments to Japanese
defence, and Japan's own capabilities.84

Were conflict to be initiated unintentionally, such as by an accident at
sea, then fighting may be limited, without strong pressure to escalate,
even if the US becomes involved. However, [[China might
**intentionally** use limited use of force against a **regional state**,
anticipating]{.mark} that its adversary will [**back down** due

**[Unknowns in the nuclear balance]{.underline}**

[There remains [**uncertainty** about **nuclear deterrence** dynamics
between the **US and China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The concept of 'entanglement' in this context refers to the **[overlap
of nuclear and conventional force structures and
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A range of analyses have highlighted
the [entanglement between China's conventional and nuclear force
structures]{.underline}.42 While analysts hold different views, it's
possible that entanglement in China's forces may reflect efficiency
measures and bureaucratic infighting more than a clear strategic
rationale, such as deterring attacks against Chinese conventional
forces.43 Whatever the cause, [the physical reality of entanglement
remains the same. [Key **new PLA weapons systems are
dual-use**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the DF-26 missile, and there
have apparently been growing efforts to integrate Rocket Force
formations into China's nascent, integrated theatre commands.44
[**[Inadvertent entanglement]{.mark}** of systems would [indicate
dangerous **complacency**]{.mark} by Chinese military planners, implying
that [**nuclear risks** aren't being taken]{.mark} sufficiently
[seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some assessments, including from the US Government,45 and open-source
satellite imagery46 indicate that [China's nuclear arsenal is now on a
substantial and accelerating **growth trajectory**, narrowing the gap
with the US arsenal]{.underline}, although it should be noted that
doubts have been raised about whether PLA corruption is degrading some
capabilities.47 Whatever the pace of the expansion in Chinese nuclear
forces, the command-and-control arrangements and operational employment
of China's deterrent demand close observation and analysis. For example,
what are China's launch policies? What positive and negative controls
are in place on different launch platforms? Western intelligence
agencies will already be focused on those questions, but reliable
assessments will be complicated by the opacity of the Chinese system.
[The [**lack of transparency** over Chinese **nuclear doctrine**]{.mark}
is exacerbated by Beijing eschewing participation in arms-control
negotiations and **restricting** channels of **military-to-military
dialogue**]{.underline}.

Many analysts have argued that China's nuclear doctrine may be
influenced by a sense of vulnerability to a US first strike. Those
analysts often point to the putative vulnerability of China's small
fleet of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), which it's in the process
of upgrading.48 [While China is also strengthening the airborne leg of
its nuclear triad, the weight of its nuclear strategic deterrent
currently rests on its **land-based missiles**]{.underline}.

[[In a war]{.mark} between China and the US, [a key question would be
how much **degradation** Beijing would be willing to **accept**
in]{.mark} its rocket forces with regional range, such as the **[DF-21
and]{.mark} DF-[26]{.mark}**.49 Those are [the **crux of
entanglement**]{.mark} in China's rocket forces]{.underline}. Given that
the intermediate-range missiles threaten US bases and warships in the
region, [[they would be **high-priority targets** for the US]{.mark} and
any allied forces in a war]{.underline}. [[Because of **warhead
ambiguity**, the US might]{.mark} unintentionally [destroy]{.mark}
Chinese [**nuclear-armed missiles**, which Beijing]{.mark} might
[interpret as a **significant threat to its**]{.mark} **overall
[deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

China's nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) arsenal, on
the other hand, is clearly distinguishable, at least for the time
being.50 Escalation may be avoided if Beijing remains confident that it
has adequate warning to launch a second strike using its ICBM force. But
that makes assumptions about Chinese perceptions and nuclear doctrine.
[If Beijing's **threshold** for escalation lies elsewhere, and we don't
know whether it does, there's cause for **grave
concern**]{.underline}.51

[[The **escalation risk**]{.mark} of targeting early-warning and
command-and-control systems, including satellites, [is
**significant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.52 [The problem of
**[entangleme]{.mark}nt** is also relevant in this context.
**[Space-based systems]{.mark}** will be critical at all stages of a
conflict, across hybrid, conventional and nuclear thresholds. Even if
space-based assets were able to be ring fenced for nuclear or
non-nuclear use, which is questionable, it's [unlikely that]{.mark} the
[targeting country could make]{.mark} that [**distinction confidently**
in wartime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Equally, [direct ascent 'kinetic' kill

weren't]{.mark} at that point **[parties to the conflict]{.mark}**.
[This **cocktail of variables has highly escalatory

Uncertainty over the targeting of early-warning and command-and-control
systems is particularly relevant to Australia, which hosts capabilities
that support US extended deterrence, including the Australian Defence
Satellite Communication Station.54

**[Potential war and the US--China balance in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}**

The first step towards improving crisis management in the Western
Pacific is understanding the relevant features of US--China strategic
dynamics.

Russia's disastrous experience in the early phases of its invasion of
Ukraine since February 2022, the problems that Ukraine has experienced
in retaking territory and the current effective stalemate in that
theatre have strengthened the view that we live in a world of defence
dominance. In that view, the incentives for war are restrained because
successfully executing an offensive campaign (such as a territorial
conquest) seems very difficult or costly.19 The idea of an
offence--defence balance is a contested one among strategic studies
scholars (for instance, it isn't really possible to categorise specific
weapons as offensive or defensive), and it has to be emphasised that the
balance is a constantly evolving one.20 But it's nonetheless useful to
think about whether it's easier to take or defend territory at a
particular point in time.

The first reason for thinking that defence presently has an edge is the
continuing existence of nuclear weapons as part of the international
order. Put simply: some academics and strategists think that the risk of
escalation to nuclear exchange has permanently disincentivised offensive
action between nuclear-armed countries or blocs, although Cold War
strategists constantly debated the credibility of nuclear threats and
the possibility for conventional war below the nuclear threshold.21

Second, recent improvements in and proliferation of long-range sensors
and weapons appear to have significantly raised the cost of power
projection.22 In the air and sea domains, this is typically referred to
by the shorthand term 'anti-access/area-denial' (A2/AD). Recent
experiences have also shown the potential levels of lethality offered by
relatively cheap sensors such as small drones combined with massed
long-range surface fires in support of land manoeuvre.23 Australian
authors have written about this situation extensively, and acquisitions
across all three services reflect an appreciation of this problem set.24

At first glance, these fundamentals might seem reassuring. [The
**[US--China]{.mark}** relationship [is framed by]{.mark}]{.underline}
both the mutual possession of nuclear weapons, even if the US stockpile
is substantially larger at present,25 and the Western Pacific is an
operating environment conducive to the employment of A2/AD systems.

There are, however, [at least four important reasons to be
**[concern]{.mark}ed** about the potential [for]{.mark} inadvertent and
accidental **[escalation]{.mark}**, as well as **pre-emption**, [in
**regional crises**]{.mark}. In sum, they suggest that an overoptimistic
view of regional escalation pressures would be in error]{.underline}.

Uncertainty and the maritime domain

[The first reason for concern is [the nature of the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}, and specially the Western
Pacific]{.underline}. Most thinking on crisis stability and deterrence
has focused on the Cold War confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact along a European land border and the associated contours of the
US--USSR nuclear relationship. But [the Indo-Pacific is principally a
maritime theatre]{.underline}. It's been argued that the maritime domain
may be less prone to inadvertent escalation and disastrous
miscalculation. Ships are inherently mobile, and when they withdraw from
a confrontation that doesn't ipso facto represent the ceding of ground,
making a backdown more politically palatable.26 Another example is
submarine deployment, which is something rarely publicly signalled and
therefore withdrawable without loss of face. In other words, a level of
ambiguity about forces in the maritime domain, or an ability to shift
intent and narrative or maintain deniability, may offer opportunities
for maintaining stability.

But those same attributes of the maritime domain could also be
interpreted as reasons for concern. To begin with, [offence--defence
**[distinguishability is very low]{.mark}** at sea]{.underline}.27 For
instance, the Washington Conference in 1921--22, which was an attempt by
the major powers to limit the naval arms race, struggled to define
offensive capability. The vertical launching system (VLS) ubiquitous on
Western warships is a prime contemporary example of this problem. An
adversary doesn't know whether VLS cells contain anti-air missiles for
self-defence, land-attack missiles for long-range strike, or the
next-generation stealthy anti-ship missile currently under development
for the US military. Submarines and the contents of their magazines pose
a similar problem.

[And some analysts have noted that 'modern warships have glass
jaws'---that is, they're vulnerable, if not to sinking, then to being
put out of action by even a single missile or torpedo
hit]{.underline}.28 [This arguably leads to a dynamic in which
'whichever side completes the targeting chain first and fires first
almost always wins', and creates a **powerful incentive to
pre-empt**]{.underline}.29 In other words, ships that can be discovered
are very vulnerable. There can, therefore, be a major advantage in
shooting first when conflict seems imminent. [This suggests the
potential for maritime scenarios in which **escalation pressures are
very strong**]{.underline}.

[The longstanding naval preoccupation with presence can also be read as
the capacity to act with little warning, and sea power has specific
characteristics that produce **uncertainty and
ambiguity**]{.underline}.30

The doctrine and concepts underwriting the employment of naval platforms
reflect those features. The various iterations of US maritime
doctrine---air--sea battle, joint concept for access and manoeuvre in
the global commons (JAM-GC), now distributed maritime operations
(DMO)---are highly offensive ways of operating. Some analysts have
rightly noted this doctrine as escalatory. As Jonathan Caverley and
Peter Dombrowski have argued:

\[A\]t the minimum, it appears the USN will focus on destroying the PLAN
fleet and associated island bases in the South China Sea should a
conflict erupt. At the maximum, it, along with the \[US\] Air Force, is
preparing for a rapid, blinding assault on the Chinese mainland to
remove any Chinese capability for denying US access beyond the twelve
nautical miles of the territory the United States recognises as Chinese
...31

It isn't surprising that these concepts are so offensive in nature: the
US military is expected to develop options that offer the prospect of
military victory in a US--China conflict. Assuming that neither side
wishes to engage in nuclear war, the focus for analysis should be on
whether US and Chinese force structures and plans increase the risks of
inadvertent or accidental escalation, pre-emption and loss of control.
In other words, which features of the strategic dynamic between the US
and China raise the risk of escalation?

In short, [[contemporary naval capabilities are **ambiguous in intent
and nature**, creating the possibilities for]{.mark} inadvertent and
accidental [**escalation**, and]{.mark} the vulnerability of critical
capabilities in a missile exchange creates **[pressures for
pre-emption]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[New domains and novel technologies]{.underline}**

There's a great deal that we simply don't understand about space,
cyberspace, the contemporary information environment and a whole raft of
emerging technologies. Classic case studies like the July crisis of 1914
are richly instructive in some ways but have their limits in the 2020s;
knowing what to heed and what to ignore is tough at the best of times.

For example, would the targeting of space-based systems inevitably lead
to terrestrial escalation? Or, more specifically, what level of
degradation to space-based systems would each power be willing to
tolerate? To what extent do innovations such as autonomous weapon
systems and hypersonics further incentivise first strike? How will a
diffused, controlled and manipulated information environment inhibit
coherent and trusted communication between crisis actors? A complete
treatment of any one of those issues is beyond my scope here. Several
tentative implications will have to suffice.

There are some limited reasons for optimism. For instance, experience
thus far with uncrewed platforms seems to suggest that the targeting of
uncrewed systems isn't viewed with the same weight as the targeting of a
crewed platform.32 Even that norm, however, could (perversely) increase
the risk of escalation if it lowers the threshold for the use of force,
or if the two combatants have different assessments of the significance
of an attack on an uncrewed platform. And, as such systems proliferate
further and their spectrum of cost and capability grows, calculations
will change.

[There are, however, more substantive grounds for concern. Considering
cyber capabilities as an example, is it possible to target critical
parts of a nation's command-and-control architecture in a limited
fashion?33 How reliant are both the US and China on vulnerable
space-based command-and-control assets? Do the US and China adequately
understand potential linkages between their nuclear and conventional
command architectures?]{.underline}34 If autonomous weapon systems
facilitate fighting 'at machine speed', that seems [likely to generate
**escalation pressures and incentivise first (and multiple)
strike**]{.underline}.35

Moreover, our understanding of how accidents happen points to a linked
concern. [As the complexity of the weapons systems involved in the
military balance soars, we should expect more things to **go
wrong**]{.underline}.36 [More so-called 'normal **accidents'** will
indeed be normal]{.underline}.37

[**Hypersonics** are another important development]{.underline}. Russia,
China and the AUKUS partners (in Pillar 2 efforts, which complement
existing bilateral programs) are all in the process of developing and
deploying hypersonic weapon systems,38 and a test by the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) in 2021 reportedly surprised American analysts.39
[The significant launch signature of **[hypersonic weapons]{.mark}**
means warning will be still possible, as with traditional ballistic
missiles. But, depending on launch platform and location]{.underline}
(potentially VLS systems at sea), [the **time** from launch to target
may be **very short**]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, because those weapons [are **manoeuvrable**]{.mark} in
flight, [assessment of]{.mark} their **[intended target]{.mark}** will
be very [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This could [raise concerns
about **decapitation strikes**]{.mark} against national leadership or
critical military infrastructure, for example, **[incentivising 'hair
trigger' retaliatory postures]{.mark}**, potentially [including
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear force[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The risks are
accentuated by]{.mark} potential **ambiguity** over whether new
platforms such as hypersonic glide vehicles carry **conventional or
nuclear payloads** (referred to as '**[warhead
ambiguity]{.mark}**')]{.underline}. As James Acton has written, [**['Is
it a nuke?']{.mark}** once again becomes a key
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}.40 [And that question might be [asked
under **great pressure**]{.mark} and [with]{.mark} precious **[little
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Even ignoring nuclear concerns, as another analyst has observed,
'hypersonic weapons may be so difficult to intercept that they may usher
in an era of offence dominance in conventional-strike warfare'.41 [[The
incentive to **launch first**]{.mark} might therefore be [very strong
under **crisis conditions**]{.mark} in which war is widely believed to
be imminent]{.underline}.

In sum, [the interaction of newly prevalent domains and emergent
technologies under crisis conditions introduces a set of significant
unknowns into the mix, and technologies such as hypersonic glide
vehicles are likely to introduce strong **pre-emption
pressures**]{.underline}.

[However, [East Asia has a **unique characteristic** when it comes to
strategic-level interactions]{.mark}. Unlike during the Cold War and the
case of the Korean Peninsula, in East Asia the main crucible of
interaction is located at sea. China and the United States have no
forces opposing each other on land, and with the exception of Taiwan
there are no arenas where the United States and China could clash that
have significant populated areas. This arguably **reduces the risk of a
clash** at sea spilling over onto land; therefore, [the **restraining
effect**]{.mark} of devastating war [that was operative during the Cold
War may be **weaker**]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} may [**allow** Chinese or
U.S. commanders the **freedom to escalate** a]{.mark} clash, given that
the potential strategic costs resulting therefrom would be
lessened]{.underline}. 74

However, while there is no existential threat, [[conflict
between]{.mark} the United States and China would mean conflict between
[the world's **two biggest economies**]{.mark} in some of the world's
most economically vital seas]{.underline}. This places pressure on both
sides to manage the instability caused by conflictual interactions. As
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated in 2017, "There cannot be
conflict between China and the United States, as both sides will lose
and both sides cannot afford that." 75

[Operationally, [the increasing presence]{.mark} and prominence
[of]{.mark} civilian [law-enforcement actors]{.mark} such as coast
guards and the role of paramilitary maritime militias are new phenomena.
This **[introduces a variable]{.mark}** that has **[not]{.mark} been
[seen previously]{.mark}**. A clash between coast guard or militia
vessels [may **escalate** to the **involvement of naval
vessels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, so far---despite substantial
clashes at sea between maritime law-enforcement actors---such escalation
has not occurred. 76

[A further issue arising from competing maritime claims in Asia is their
linkage with nationalism and history. [Contested claims over the
**sovereign control of islands**]{.mark} and operations in contested
waters have [provoke]{.mark}d [significant **public reaction**
in]{.mark} countries across the region, including [China]{.mark},
Vietnam, and the Philippines. [Clashes]{.mark} that occur at sea
increasingly are portrayed on social media, and while that might
constrain maritime actors from acting aggressively, it also could
[**stoke protests** to which governments might feel the need to
respond]{.mark}, [to **assuage**]{.mark} **their
[publics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Significant protests occurred in China
following Japan's nationalization of the Senkaku Islands and in Vietnam
following China's exploration activities near the Paracel Islands, but
these did not result in escalatory processes and the governments in
question eventually acted to quell public displays of dissatisfaction.
77 However, it should be acknowledged that [[even a **single**]{.mark}
**future [clash]{.mark}** at sea [may]{.mark} act as a [trigger]{.mark}
for **[nationalist sentiment]{.mark}**, [which]{.mark} could **[elevate
an incident]{.mark}** beyond its objective political or strategic value
[and result in **unforeseen escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As with the Cold War, tensions have produced some positive outcomes,
particularly in managing interactions at sea and reducing the risk of
miscalculation. The 2014 multinational Code for Unplanned Encounters at
Sea (CUES) agreement indicated a desire to manage interactions at sea.
Similarly, the 2016 agreement between China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on CUES and ongoing negotiations over a
code of conduct for the South China Sea should be seen as starting
points to mitigate further the potential for unintended escalation at
sea. 78

Given the concerns that the Soviet Union highlighted in the 1970s
regarding the escalatory potential of inexperienced officers, the rapid
expansion of Asian coast guards should be noted. The circumstances of
East Asia, where coast guards are taking the lead in enforcing maritime
claims, suggest a need for similar agreements within this context. Such
agreements should be tailored to the specific roles that coast guards
undertake. 79 As with naval agreements during the Cold War, for such
agreements to be successful it is vital that all sides perceive their
operational and political benefits.

Hotlines also are present in Northeast Asia, most notably between the
military services of South Korea and Japan and those of South Korea and
China. 80 There also are moves toward a working-level hotline between
China and ASEAN. Further, there is a South Korea--China coast guard
hotline, which soon could be replicated between China and the
Philippines. 81 However, hotlines are effective only when both sides
agree to use them. There is some evidence that in times of crisis China
has not used hotlines effectively. In January 2017, a fleet of Chinese
military aircraft entered the South Korean air-defense identification
zone. Reports suggest that the Chinese did not answer the hotline when
South Korean officials attempted to contact them to clarify the fleet's
intentions. Nevertheless, Japan and China also are in the process of
agreeing on a communication mechanism to de-escalate unintended
incidents in the East China Sea. 82

This analysis suggests that the fear that escalation will result from an
incident at sea is, by and large, overemphasized. Clashes in areas of
strategic tension or contested maritime boundaries are to be expected;
however, there is little evidence that such clashes lead to escalatory
cycles or sustained violence.

This absence of escalatory behavior can be attributed to several factors
that maritime strategic geography imposes. Historically, the strategic
or political benefits of escalation at sea rarely have outweighed the
potential costs. The bottom line is that what happens at sea rarely
materially affects populations on land, and therefore a costly war over
maritime issues is less likely to occur.

De-escalation after an incident is facilitated by the fact that the sea
cannot be controlled permanently, so the costs of withdrawal are
reduced, as such a move does not result automatically in the loss of
territory. Further, the size of the maritime environment, coupled with
the speed of clashes at sea, allows for easier de-escalation, as time is
needed to concentrate often-dispersed maritime forces. Organic
escalation therefore is less likely to occur, since political and
military elites would be required to commit expensive assets
intentionally to continue a clash. Equally, information gathering also
is hindered by the nature of operations at sea. Time often is required
to ascertain facts fully, and this gap allows for political and
strategic tensions to cool.

[**[It would be wrong to suggest that it is impossible for an outbreak
of sustained violence at sea in Asia to occur]{.mark}**. Decision makers
could choose to escalate following a clash at sea, or they might feel
they had no other option. Further, the **geostrategic situation** in
East Asia]{.underline}, where the stakes are not existential, [may
increase the risk of one side seeing a strategic or political **benefit
from escalating** such a clash deliberately]{.underline}. However, to
date, incidents at sea in the region have not resulted in substantial
escalation; instead, they have conformed to the patterns outlined in
this analysis.

Infectious disease has been a contributing factor in 3.7% of species
extinctions known to have occurred between the years 1,500 and 2008
(Smith et al., 2009). In humans, the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak
killed 1--5% of world population (Johnson and Mueller, 2002,
Spreeuwenberger et al. 2018).6 Koch et al. (2019) estimate that
epidemics killed 90% of the indigenous population of the Americas as the
result of diseases carried over by European colonists in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.

[[It is]{.mark} considered [**very unlikely** that a **naturally
occurring pandemic**]{.mark}7 [would be a primary cause of]{.mark} human
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Ord, 2020), [and the author is
aware [of **no credible work** present]{.mark}ing [**plausible
pathways**. Such a disease would need **both** to spread to]{.mark}
nearly **[all humans]{.mark}** across the world [**and** be of
**extremely high lethality** or cause **infertility** at extremely high
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it seems plausible that pandemic
disease could play a contributing role in combination with other factors
in an extinction scenario.

A common concern is that advances in the biological sciences and
biotechnology could enable the creation of more dangerous viruses and
other forms of biological agent than exist in nature (Millett and
Snyder-Beattie, 2017). Biological weapon development and use are
prohibited under the Biological Weapons Convention; however, leading
states have developed major biological weapons programmes in the past,
and it is conceivable that such directions might be pursued in future or
are presently being pursued clandestinely (Riedel, 2004). Further,
advances in these sciences lower the barrier to entry to the development
of dangerous agents in terms of cost, expertise and equipment needed,
potentially bringing globally catastrophic capabilities within the reach
of small groups in future. While groups willing to bring about global
catastrophe or even extinction would be expected to be rare, there have
been notable examples of groups motivated by near-apocalyptic ideology
such as the Aum Shinrikyo cult,8 which attempted to weaponise Anthrax
and carried out successful local nerve agent attacks (Lifton, 1999;
Torres, 2016). Gopal et al. (2023) outline two scenarios leading to
civilisational collapse: a "wildfire" scenario in which one or more
pandemic agents leads to disruption of food, water, power supply and law
enforcement and a "stealth" scenario in which an initially asymptomatic
agent with long incubation time is spread to a majority of humanity.
They consider both scenarios most likely to involve accidental or
deliberate release of human-modified agents. Direct targeting of humans
is only one plausible pathway to global harm; Monica Schoch-Spana et al.
(2017) note the potential pathogens targeting widespread eradication of
food sources; and other forms of environmental harm are plausible.

High-Mortality Pandemics

[[A]{.mark} naturally occurring [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e.,
not from an engineered pathogen) [[that]{.mark} would [threaten]{.mark}
human [extinction is a **very small** probability]{.mark}
event]{.underline}. However, historical accounts point to several
instances where disease spread played an important role in causing very
significant decline of specific populations. For example, the
introduction of novel diseases to the Native American population during
the European colonization of the Americas had deadly consequences. It is
difficult to distinguish the effects of the diseases that came with the
Europeans from the war and conflict they also brought with them.
Nevertheless, during the first hundred years of the colonization period,
the American population may have been reduced by as much as 90% (Ord
2020).

Moreover, two major pandemic events, the Justinian Plague in the sixth
century and the Black Death in the fourteenth century appear to have
been severe enough to cause a significant population decline of tens of
percent in the populations they affected. Both events are believed to
have been caused by plague, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria
Yersinia Pestis (Christakos et al. 2005; Allen 1979). While there is a
certain degree of uncertainty involved in studying these events'
societal impacts, historical accounts in combination with modern
scientific methods provide us with some valuable insights into the
effects they may have had on the societies of the time.

With respect to the possibility of a future catastrophic global
pandemic, it appears that this risk is increasing significantly along
with the advances in the field of synthetic biology and the rising
possibility of an accidental or intentional release of an engineered
pathogen. While some of the scientific efforts in the field of synthetic
biology are directed towards increasing our understanding and our
ability to prevent future catastrophic epidemic threats, the risk
stemming from these activities is non-trivial, and may outweigh their
benefits.

The Justinian Plague

The Justinian Plague severely affected the people of Europe and East
Asia, though estimates of its overall mortality vary. Focusing
exclusively on the first wave of the pandemic (AD 541--544), Muehlhauser
(2017) suggests the pandemic was associated with a 20% mortality in the
Byzantine empire. This estimate is based on the mortality rate estimated
for the empire's capital, Constantinople, by Stathakopoulos (2007) to
produce a death toll of roughly 5.6 million. For a longer time span, AD
541 to 600, which included subsequent waves of the plague, scholars
estimate a higher mortality rate of 33--50% (Allen 1979; Meier 2016).

The demographic changes associated with this high mortality led to a
significant disruption of economic activity in the Byzantine empire
(Gârdan 2020). A decline in the labour force caused a decline in
agricultural production which led to food shortages and famine (Meier
2016). Trade also collapsed. Decreased tax revenues caused by the
population decline initiated a major fiscal contraction and consequently
a military crisis for the empire (Sarris 2002; Meier 2016). In the
longer run, however, the massive reduction of the labour force appears
to have had a positive economic effect for the surviving laborers, as
the increased marginal value of labour caused a rise in real wages and
per capita incomes. These beneficial effects for the survivors were also
observed after the Black Death (Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014; Findlay and
Lundahl 2017).

The mortality and the disruption of activity the plague caused in the
Byzantine empire also led to further direct and indirect cultural and
religious consequences. Meier (2016) particularly highlights the
plague's indirect effect of an increase in liturgification (a process of
religious permeation and internalization throughout society as defined
by Meier 2020), the rise of the Marian cult, and the sacralization of
the emperor.

The direct and indirect effects of the plague also appear to have had
far-reaching and long-term political repercussions. The societal
disruptions caused by the plague are believed to have significantly
weakened the position of the Byzantine empire and arguably led to the
decline of the Sasanian empire (Sabbatani et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the pandemic indirectly favoured the nomadic Arab tribes who were less
vulnerable to the contagion while traveling through desert and
semi-desert environments during the initial expansion of Islam
(Sabbatani et al. 2012).

Of note is the absence of a scientific consensus on the severity of the
Justinian Plague's impacts. For example, Mordechai and Eisenberg (2019)
and Mordechai et al. (2019) argue against the maximalist interpretation
of the historical evidence described above. They suggest that the
estimated mortality rate of the plague is exaggerated, and that the
pandemic was not a primary cause of the transformational demographic,
political and economic changes in the Mediterranean region between the
sixth and eighth century. Recently, White and Mordechai (2020)
highlighted the high likelihood of the plague having different impacts
in the urban areas of the Mediterranean outside of Constantinople.

The Black Death

The Black Death which ravaged Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia in
the middle of the fourteenth century is considered the deadliest
pandemic in human history and potentially the most severe global
catastrophe to have ever struck mankind. With respect to its mortality,
Ord (2020) argues that the best estimate of its global mortality rate is
5--14% of the global population, largely based on Muehlhauser (2017).

The plague created a large demographic shock in the affected regions. It
reduced the European population by approximately 30--50% during the 6
years of its initial outbreak (Ord 2020). It took approximately two
centuries for the population levels to recover (Livi-Bacci 2017; Jedwab
et al. 2019b). As the mortality rates appear to have been the highest
among the working-age population, the effects on the labour force were
acute (Pamuk 2007).

The plague\'s mortality, morbidity and the associated societal
disruption led to a major decline in economic output both in Europe
(Pamuk 2007) and the Middle East (Dols 2019). In Europe, however, this
decline in economic output was smaller than the decline in population;
output per capita began to increase within a few years of the initial
outbreak (Pamuk 2007).

The large demographic shock caused by the plague led to a shift in the
relative price of labour which, similarly to the Justinian Plague, had a
positive impact on wages. With a reduced labour force, real wages and
per capita incomes in many European countries increased and were
sustained at higher levels for several centuries (Voigtländer and Voth
2013a; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014). Scott and Duncan
(2001) point out that real wages approximately doubled in most countries
of Europe in the century following the plague.

An additional insight into the long-run relationship between the Black
Death's mortality and per capita incomes in Europe is offered by
Voigtländer and Voth (2013a). Using a Malthusian model, they suggest
that over time, the rise in income caused by the plague's mortality led
to an increase in urbanization and trade. Furthermore, the increased tax
burden (per capita), combined with the contemporary political climate,
increased the frequency of wars. Consequently, higher urbanization and
trade led to an increase in disease spread which along with a more
frequent war occurrence caused a long-term increase in mortality and a
further positive effect on per capita incomes. In this way, the Black
Death appears to have created a long-lasting environment of
high-mortality and high-income specifically in Western Europe,
functioning as an important contributing factor to its economic growth
in the next centuries (Alfani 2020). However, while in Western Europe
incomes remained elevated over the next centuries, in Southern Europe
they began to decline as the Southern European population started
recovering after AD 1500 (Jedwab et al. 2020).

Apart from the positive effects on wages, the increased marginal value
of labour combined with other factors had further economic and social
implications. A decreased relative value of land and the lack of
workforce to use it effectively caused land prices and land rents to
decrease (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk 2007). A decreased marginal value of
capital assets in general led to a lapse in the enforcement of property
rights (Haddock and Kiesling 2002). Interest rates and real rates of
return on assets also decreased (Pamuk 2007; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
and Shatzmiller 2014; Jordà et al. 2021; Clark 2016).

Higher wages in combination with a relative abundance of land increased
people's access to land/home ownership, likely reducing social
inequality (Alfani 2020). On the other end of the income distribution,
decreased incomes for landowners led to an overall decrease in income
inequality (Jedwab et al. 2020; Alfani and Murphy 2017).

With respect to the effects on agriculture, the structure of
agricultural output moved away from cereals to other crops following the
plague. Furthermore, the workforce shortages and the incentives to
increase the labour supply are believed to have caused a shift from
male-labour intensive arable farming towards pastoral farming,
consequently raising the demand for female labour (Voigtländer and Voth
2013b). However, while the Black Death appears to have caused certain
structural agricultural changes, Clark (2016) finds no effect of the
plague on agricultural productivity in the long run.

In terms of other social consequences, the evidence suggests that the
plague\'s mortality reduced labour coercion, particularly throughout
Western Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Haddock and Kiesling 2002; Gingerich
and Vogler 2021). The increased bargaining power of labour caused by the
plague's demographic shock contributed to and accelerated the decline in
serfdom and development of a free labour regime. Gingerich and Voler
(2021) further argue that these effects may have had long-lasting
political implications and that a decline of repressive labour practices
(such as serfdom) permitted the development of more inclusive political
institutions. They find that the regions with the highest mortality were
more likely to develop participatory political institutions and more
equitable land ownership systems. They find that centuries later, In
Germany, the populations in these high-mortality regions were less
likely to vote for Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party in the 1930
and 1932 elections in Germany.

However, the positive effects on the emergence of freer labour did not
take place in Eastern Europe, where serfdom was sustained and even
intensified. Robinson and Torvik (2011) attempt to explain this
asymmetry arguing that these differential outcomes may have been caused
by the varying power and quality of institutions. The authors suggest
that opportunities generated by the increased bargaining power of
labour, in an environment of weak institutions, were less likely to lead
to a positive effect than in the case of regions with stronger
institutions (with more robust rule-of-law or less corrupt or predatory
practices).

Apart from causing a negative demographic shock to the affected
populations, the Black Death appears to have caused further indirect
demographic changes, particularly in Western Europe. The increased
employment opportunities for females caused by worker shortages and a
higher female labour demand led to a decline in fertility rates and an
increased age of marriage (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b). This demographic
transition to a population characterized by lower birth rates likely
helped to preserve the high levels of per capita incomes and contributed
to further economic development of certain parts of Europe, enabling it
to escape the "Malthusian trap" in the following centuries (Pamuk 2007).
Siuda and Sunde (2021) confirm the pandemic's effect on the accelerated
demographic transition empirically, as they find that greater pandemic
mortality was associated with an earlier onset of the demographic
transition across the various regions of Germany.

Unfortunately, the Black Death also led to an increase in the
persecution of Jews (Finley and Koyama 2018; Jedwab et al. 2019a).
Interestingly, Jedwab et al. (2019a) were able to estimate that in the
case of regions with the highest mortality rates, the probability of
persecution decreased if the Jewish minority was believed to benefit the
local economy.

It is important to highlight that the long-term repercussions of the
Black Death were highly asymmetrical. While in Western Europe the
pandemic appears to have led to some long-term dynamic shifts associated
with increased wages, decreased inequality and a decrease in labour
coercion, this was not the case for other regions. A decrease in wages
was observed for example in Spain (Alfani 2020) and Egypt. In Spain, the
plague\'s demographic impact on an already scarce population caused a
long-lasting negative disruption to the local trade-oriented economy.
The workforce disruption in Egypt led to a collapse of the
labour-intensive irrigation system for growing crops in the Nile valley,
with consequent disastrous effects on the rural economy (Alfani 2020).
Borsch (2005) argues that the economic decline in Egypt caused by the
Black Death "put an end to the power in the heartland of the Arab world"
(p. 114) and to the impressive scientific and technological developments
that came out of this region.

A consensus for an explanation of the Black Death's varied impacts
across regions, and their determinants, does not appear to exist.
However, several researchers attempt to provide partial insights. For
example, Alfani (2020) considers the differential outcomes to be broadly
dependent upon the initial conditions in each region. More specifically,
both Robinson and Torvik (2011) and Pamuk (2007) propose that the
asymmetry of impacts can largely be explained by the differences in the
institutional environments of the affected societies.

It is argued that the Black Death defined the threshold between the
medieval and the modern ages, similarly to the way the Justinian Plague
did for antiquity and the Middle Ages (Horden 2021). Furthermore, the
differential long-term outcomes of the Black Death likely provided a
significant contribution to the so-called "Great Divergence" between
Europe and the rest of the world and the "Little Divergence" between
North-western and Southern and Eastern Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
2007).

From this perspective, it would seem rational to conclude that apart
from causing substantial and long-term demographic, economic, political,
and cultural changes, both the Justinian Plague and the Black Death
likely significantly altered the course of human history.

Considering the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that a pandemic
of a similar magnitude to these past catastrophes would do the same in
the present day. However, what societal impacts a pandemic of similar or
higher mortality would inflict in the twenty-first century has not
really been the subject of any study, as far as we were able to
identify. A possibility exists, given the newly developed capacity of
humanity to create new pathogens, that the outcomes of a future
catastrophic pandemic will be even more adverse than those of the
Justinian Plague and the Black Death.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **[200,000 years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus
for around six million years [[without]{.mark} being
[exterminated]{.mark} by an infectious disease, which [is
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the]{.mark} base [rate]{.mark} of
extinction-risk natural pathogens [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82
Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have not **come
close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans extinct]{.underline}.
Although bodies were piled high in the streets across Europe during the
Black Death,83 human extinction was never a serious possibility, and
some [economists [even]{.mark} argue]{.underline} that it was [[a boon
for the]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[economy]{.underline}.]{.mark}84
Secondly, [infectious [disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [only
[contributed to]{.mark} the [extinction of a]{.mark} **small
[minority]{.mark} of animal species**]{.underline}.85 [The [only

may be importantly different for modern day humans, so it is unclear
whether the risk is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to
globalisation, the world is more interconnected making it easier for
pathogens to spread. On the other hand, [[interconnectedness

3\. DISCUSSION The [large increase in international travel]{.underline}
over the last century [might be assumed to have resulted in a high
chance of]{.underline} a [devastating]{.underline} global
[pandemic]{.underline} (see e.g. \[32\]). Here [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[used a]{.mark} **general epidemiological [model]{.mark}** [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[an important]{.underline}**,
yet often **[overlooked, factor]{.underline}** in the dynamics of a
newly introduced high-virulence (HV) pathogen strain is partial immunity
driven by exposures to related pathogen strains. When a HV pathogen
strain arrives in a population following an epidemic of a related but
low virulence (LV) strain, the probability of a major epidemic of the HV
strain is decreased. [[High]{.mark} rates of
[travel]{.mark}]{.underline} between spatially distinct subpopulations
can [[drive **larger outbreaks** of **low virulence
pathogens**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn [[providing]{.mark} **higher
levels of [immunity]{.mark}**]{.underline} if/when a HV strain, which
has the potential to cause a devastating epidemic, appears in the
population (Fig 4a-c). Not only did we find that the probability of a
major epidemic of the HV strain decreases when travel between
subpopulations increases, but the expected final size of the HV strain
outbreak can also be reduced. This was particularly pronounced when the
level of cross-immunity between strains was high (Fig 4i), since lower
cross-immunity levels combined with high travel rates can lead to large
epidemics due to increased mixing between subpopulations (Fig 4g). When
between-subpopulation travel was increased, the reduction in the
probability of a major epidemic of the HV strain, and the expected size,
was largely due to cross-immunity reducing the proportion of outbreaks
that proceeded to become major epidemics. If/when major epidemics
occurred, we found that they were typically larger when there was more
travel between regions (Fig 4d-e), although this was not always the
case, particularly when the level of cross-immunity was very high (Fig
4f). Partial cross-immunity against a highly virulent strain from prior
exposure to a less virulent strain is characteristic of influenza
outbreaks in different seasons. For example, it has been suggested that
individuals born before 1890 were protected against the 1918 H1N1
pandemic due to the outbreak in 1889-90 \[33\] and that individuals
infected with multiple historical seasonal H1N1 influenza strains were
protected against the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic strain \[34\]. Our
[[results suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**cross-immunity** might
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential [[explanatory]{.underline}]{.mark}
factor [[as to why]{.mark} there has n[ot]{.mark} been a [pandemic as
devastating as]{.mark} the [1918]{.mark} influenza]{.underline} epidemic
in the century since, despite the emergence of a strain antigenically
similar to the 1918 pandemic strain in 2009. [Travel rates increased
substantially during the 20th century]{.underline}. As a theoretical
exercise, we obtained crude estimates of the travel rates from Europe to
the USA, comparing rates during the early 20th century with current
travel rates. For the early 20th century rates, we used registry
statistics from USA ports from 1914 to 1924 (see Supplementary Material
Section 5). Oceanic travel should approximate overall trans-Atlantic
travel in this time period, as other modes of long-distance travel were
extremely rare. This yielded the approximation λ≈ 3.6· 10-6 per day.
Conversely, when estimating current rates of travel from European
countries to the USA, approximated using data on air travel, we obtain
much higher values of λ≈ 3.7· 10-4 per day. It might be expected that
[such [a significant rise in travel]{.mark}]{.underline} in this time
period [might have **[reduced]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** of a global
pandemic of a pathogen [with **circulating strains** that **induce
cross-immunity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cross-immunity is **[known to
affect]{.mark}**]{.underline} the dynamics of
**[[outbreaks]{.underline}]{.mark}** of various pathogens. Vibrio
cholera, for example, exhibits almost complete cross-immunity between
strains (a study by Koelle et al. \[35\] used a cross-immunity level of
α= 0.955). On the other hand, human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV)
has been shown to provide incomplete cross-immunity against infections
from the same virus group (α ≈ 0.6, \[36\]). It also provides low levels
of cross-immunity again hRSV infections from different virus groups (α ≈
0.16, \[36\]), and partial cross-immunity against infections with human
Parainfluenza Virus\[37\]

Several [**[epidemics]{.mark}**, such as the Black Death and the Spanish
flu, have [threaten]{.mark}ed **[human life]{.mark}** throughout
history; however, it is unclear if humans will remain safe from the
sudden and fast spread of epidemic diseases]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
[transmission **characteristics**]{.mark} of epidemics
[remain]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[undiscovered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
this study, [we present]{.underline} the results of [an epidemic
**simulation experiment** revealing the relationship between epidemic
**parameters** and **pandemic risk**]{.underline}. To analyze the
time-dependent risk and impact of epidemics, we considered two
parameters for infectious diseases: the recovery time from infection and
the transmission rate of the disease. Based on the epidemic simulation,
we identified two important aspects of human safety with regard to the
threat of a pandemic. First, humans should be safe if the fatality rate
is below 100%. Second, even when the fatality rate is 100%, humans would
be safe if the average degree of human social networks is below a
threshold value. Nevertheless, certain [[**diseases**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [**[infect]{.mark} all nodes** in
the [human]{.mark} social **[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
[these]{.underline} diseases [cause a pandemic when the average degree
is larger than the threshold value.]{.underline}
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} results indicated that certain infectious
[diseases [lead to **human extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline} and can be
prevented by minimizing human contact. 1. Introduction [The emergence of
a **pandemic** is]{.underline} one of the various scenarios frequently
discussed as [a **human extinction event**]{.underline}, and it is
listed as [one of the global]{.underline} [**catastrophic risks** in
studies regarding the future]{.underline} \[1,2,3\]. In particular,
[several]{.underline} pandemics, [such as]{.underline} [[the **Black
Death**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4,5\], [Spanish flu]{.underline} \[6\],
and those caused by **[[smallpox]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[7\], severe
acute respiratory syndrome (**[[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}**) \[8\],
[[and **Ebola**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\], [have]{.underline}
[[affected a **large population**]{.underline}]{.mark} [throughout
history. The **[risk]{.mark}** of pandemics]{.underline} [[**increases**
with]{.mark} an increase in population
**[mobility]{.mark}**]{.underline} between cities, nations, and
continents, thereby [[threatening **humankind**]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10,11,12\]. [It is essential to analyze the **epidemic spread** in
society to **minimize the damage**]{.underline} from epidemic disasters;
however, extinctive epidemic spreading experiments have limitations in
real-world situations, as they predict stochastic effects on the spread
without considering the structure of human society. Network-based
approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations and perform
epidemic spreading simulations by considering the network structure of
numerous real-world connections \[13,14,15\]. These methods use various
models of epidemic spreading, such as the
susceptible--infectious--susceptible (SIS) \[16,17,18\],
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) \[19,20,21\], and Watts
threshold models \[22\]. While these methods are mathematically
convenient, they are epidemiologically unrealistic for various
infections because they require exponentially distributed incubation and
infectious periods \[23,24,25\]. Moreover, previous epidemic studies did
not perform quantitative assessment of the pandemic risk depending on
the network connectivity in individuals and fatality rate of various
diseases \[26\]. In the present study, we applied an SIR epidemic model
to a scale-free network with Monte Carlo simulation to identify the
quantitative relationship between infectious diseases and human
existence. Our fundamental hypothesis states that [when the epidemic
**spreads** to all **nodes**]{.underline} of the network and the
fatality rate is 100%, [it can increase the]{.underline} **[pandemic
risk]{.underline}**. To address this, we initially constructed a
scale-free network to simulate a society. Moreover, for the epidemic
spreading simulation, an SIR model was applied to the network to
describe the immune state of an individual after infection. From the
simulation study, we found that the mean degree of a scale-free network
was an essential factor in determining whether epidemics threaten
humans. This approach provides important insights into epidemic
spreading analysis by investigating the relationship between epidemic
and scale-free network parameters. Furthermore, it highlights the
necessity of determining information flow during an epidemic. 2.
Materials and Methods [We designed an epidemic **simulation
process**]{.underline} to identify the relationship between pandemic
risk and network parameters. This study was performed in four steps
(Figure 1): (i) generating a scale-free network model to reflect
real-world conditions; (ii) applying an SIR model to the scale-free
network for epidemic spreading simulations; (iii) adapting the Monte
Carlo method to reflect the stochastic process in the node status of the
SIR model; and (iv) iteratively performing simulation for every
parameter set and analyzing the results. We have provided the source
code and sample results of epidemic simulation in Supplementary
Materials. Figure 1. Overview of epidemic simulation process based on
the Monte Carlo method. (A) We generated scale-free networks for a fixed
population (N = 1,000,000) and various node degrees (k = 2, 5, 7, and
10). (B) Epidemic spreading was simulated by applying a
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) model to the scale-free
network. We set the epidemic parameters, β and γd. β represents the
spreading rate of epidemics, and γd is the reciprocal of γ and reflects
the time interval between infection and recovery. Randomly, 0.05% of
nodes were initially infected. (C) [We adapted the **Monte Carlo
method** to determine the status of the transition]{.underline} from the
infection node to immunization node. Repeated simulations were performed
until a steady state was achieved. (D) For every parameter set, 10,000
simulations were performed. 2.1. Network Generation Based on a
Scale-Free Model We constructed a network model for the epidemic
spreading simulation (Figure 1). The nodes and edges of the network
represent people in the society and their physical contacts,
respectively. We used a scale-free network model, which follows the
preferential attachment property observed in numerous real-world
networks, such as social networks, physical systems, and economic
networks \[27,28,29\]. In the scale-free network, when a node is added
to the network, its likelihood of connecting to existing nodes increases
with an increase in the node's degree. Hub nodes, which lead to fast and
vast spreading of epidemics, exist. Two characteristic parameters,
including N and k, affect the form of scale-free networks. The parameter
N denotes all nodes in the network. In the real world, N indicates the
whole population size. The parameter k is the average degree of the
network, which determines the degree of the newly attached node for each
step during network generation. Following the characteristics of the
network model, we generated scale-free networks representing human
contacts for epidemic spread. The scale-free network was generated by
the Barabasi--Albert graph distribution, in which the network is
constructed from a cycle graph with three vertices, followed by the
addition of k edges at each construction step \[30\]. The k edges are
randomly attached to the vertex based on the degree distribution of the
vertex. After network generation, we investigated the degree
distribution properties of the network (Figure 2). The results indicate
that the degree distributions have similar tendency for networks with
varying number of nodes and edges. This study constructed scale-free
networks with the largest number of nodes considering computational
complexity (N = 1,000,000). Figure 2. Degree distribution of the
scale-free network. We analyzed the degree distribution of the network
based on the number of nodes (N) and mean degree (k). 2.2. Epidemic
Spreading Based on the SIR Model For the epidemic spreading simulations,
we applied an SIR model to the generated scale-free network. The
classical SIR model can be expressed by the following nonlinear
differential equations \[21\]: where S, I, and R represent susceptible,
infected, and recovered compartments, respectively, in the whole
population. S represents people who have not been infected yet but can
be infected in future. I represents infected people who can spread the
epidemic to susceptible people through physical contact. R denotes
people who have recovered or died from the epidemic and who no longer
participate in the epidemic spreading process. The sum of the S, I, and
R values represents the whole population size N. Epidemics have two
parameters in the SIR model, transmission rate (β) and recovery rate
(γ), which arise from the basic reproduction number R0 (Figure 1B). The
basic reproduction number is the number of infections caused by one
infective node \[31,32,33\]. If the R0 is more than 1, the infection can
spread in a population, whereas if R0 is less than 1, the infection
cannot spread. We express the basic reproduction number as R0 = β/γ,
where β represents the spreading rate of epidemics between infective
nodes and adjacent susceptible nodes and γ represents the probability of
recovery from infection \[34\]. We mainly used γd, which is the
reciprocal of γ and reflects the time interval between infection and
recovery. 2.3. Investigation of Epidemic Status Based on the Monte Carlo
Method The epidemic simulation was performed for a time series event by
constructing epidemic status matrix (z) to represent the status of the
nth node at time step t. For each node, the value of epidemic status
matrix at time step t can be 0, 1, or 2, indicating that a node is
susceptible, infective, or recovered, respectively. We initially (t = 0)
set every value of epidemic status matrix to 0 because all nodes are
susceptible before the epidemic spreads. At the initial infection stage,
randomly selected 0.05% of nodes were infected. At every time period, we
performed immunization and observed the infection stages (Figure 3). At
the immunization stage, we identified infective nodes and determined
whether these nodes would be recovered in the next time step. To
calculate the transition probability of infected and recovered
phenomena, the Monte Carlo method was applied \[35,36\]. When infection
and recovery parameters are provided, it is possible to investigate
whether a node transitions from an epidemic state to another state. To
accomplish this, we compared the method revealing the change in each
population in every compartment over time (Figure 4). The final steady
state of the epidemic spreading simulation model indicates the total
number of casualties of the epidemic who either are dead or have
recovered from the disease. Infective nodes at time t (zn \[t\] = 1) are
transformed to recovered nodes at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 2) when
1/γd is larger than a random real number between 0 and 1. We determined
whether the neighbor nodes of the infection node would be infected by
identifying susceptible nodes adjacent to the infective nodes at time t
(zn \[t\] = 0, with the adjacent infective node) (Figure 5). When β is
larger than a random real number between 0 and 1, a susceptible node
becomes an infective node at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] = 1); this
scenario represents epidemic spread. For each time step, we recorded the
number of susceptible, infective, and recovered nodes during epidemic
spread. 2.4. Simulation Parameters We carried out simulation trials for
various mean degrees of networks (k = 2, 5, 7, and 10). Each network
considered the following epidemic parameters: β ranges from 0.05 to 0.95
and γd ranges from 1 to 10. The Monte Carlo model was repeatedly
simulated to observe saturation of the recovery process. Considering
that the simulation pipeline contains random processes such as initial
infection and Monte Carlo trials, we performed the simulation
iteratively until the status of nodes remained unchanged. After
simulation, time series data from every simulation were interpolated in
the time domain. The fatality rate determines the ratio of deceased and
recovered individuals in the final population \[37,38,39\]. If the
fatality rate is below 100%, the recovered population contains both dead
and recovered individuals. Such a situation does not always cause a
pandemic. In this simulation, we assumed a 100% fatality rate. To
accomplish this, we enumerated the recovered nodes as dead for
considering the pandemic risk. 3. Results Through our method, we
obtained epidemic spreading data with various network and epidemic
parameter sets. In the present study, we focused on the case where the
epidemic infects all nodes and defined this phenomenon as "extinctive
spread". [[Diseases causing]{.underline} [**extinctive spread**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [potential candidates of [high]{.mark} pandemic
**[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the real world, [extinctive spreading
indicates]{.underline} that the [disease will infect **every person** in
the society]{.underline}. From the simulation data, we calculated the
extinctive spread score by dividing the total number of simulation
trials by the number of extinctive spread cases. Thereafter, we
identified that the number of extinctive spread cases is mainly
influenced by spreading speed, which is determined by β, γd, and k
(Figure 6). The extinctive spread region (brown area in Figure 6) is
expanded as the value of mean degree of network (k) is increased,
thereby indicating that the area of extinctive spread becomes noticeably
wider in a dense network than in a sparse network. Thus, the more
contact between people, the higher the risk of epidemics. Moreover, high
γd and high β cause extinctive spread across a large region, indicating
that the high spreading rate and short time interval between infection
and recovery are risk factors of epidemic diseases. In contrast, the
infective nodes recover before they transmit the disease to their
neighbors in low β and low γd scenarios, thus disconnecting the network
and preventing extinctive spread. This occurs because the infective
nodes need more time to transmit the disease in low β and high γd
scenarios. Therefore, the disease begins to subside due to a lack of new
infective nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the range of β and γd for
existing epidemics of the common cold \[40,41\] and fatal diseases,
namely, cholera \[42,43\], Marburg \[44,45\], Ebola (Congo and Uganda)
\[46,47,48,49\], SARS \[50\], and MERS \[51\] (Table 1). We selected
diseases with relatively well-known epidemic parameters, such as average
duration of infection and basic number of reproductions from previous
studies. Transmission rates were calculated using the mean duration of
infectious periods and basic reproduction numbers of the epidemics.
Different studies reveal multiple values of infectious period and
transmission rate for some of these diseases; we considered these values
separately \[40,41,42,43,46,47,48,49\]. For example, the infectious
period of a common cold is from 3 to 7 days and that of Ebola is 6.5
days. Next, we placed the possible regions of these epidemics as a
disease band for various k values (colored lines in Figure 6). When k \>
5, fatal diseases have an opportunity to cause a pandemic. Even when k =
5, diseases such as cholera and Ebola (Congo) can be threatening in
regions of low γd and high, thus demonstrating that the knowledge of
network parameters of the society and the characteristics of epidemic
diseases can aid in quantifying the risk of epidemics. 4. Discussion
[Many [**previous** studies]{.mark} have made stochastic SIR models to
analyze the dynamics or stability of epidemic diseases]{.underline}.
They investigated the distribution of susceptible, infected, and removed
populations for specific epidemic disease spreading, such as cholera,
SARS, Marburg, and MERS, based on mathematical modelling
\[52,53,54,55\]. [However, they [did **not**]{.mark} conduct a
quantitative assessment of pandemic risk taking into [account **physical
contact** between people]{.mark}]{.underline}. To solve this limitation,
we performed epidemic spreading simulations by applying an SIR model to
scale-free networks with Monte Carlo simulation. In the simulation, [we
consider various connectivity and disease characteristics]{.underline}
on scale-free networks. For each network and epidemic parameter set, the
probability of extinctive spread was calculated. [The [results]{.mark}
**[reveal]{.mark}**ed that **[certain]{.mark} infectious
[diseases]{.mark}** can [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} extinction.
Moreover, even if the disease band extends over the extinctive spread
regions, it does not indicate that human extinction results from the
disease, as the fatality rate is below 100%; however, in the case of
100% fatality, the disease can cause a human extinction event. The risk
of infectious disease is influenced by the network structure. A dense
network has a higher risk of spreading infectious disease than a sparse
network, as we observed in the extinctive spreading maps. According to
our results, when the average degree of human social networks is below
the risk threshold, i.e., less than 4 in this study, human society is
safe from an extinctive outbreak based on our knowledge regarding the
epidemic parameters of the infectious disease. Nevertheless, in other
cases, **[[human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** is possible. For
example, if the population is 1,000,000 and there are 4 or more
instances of physical contact between people, human extinction events
may occur, depending on the fatality rate of the epidemics. Hence,
physical contact between people is closely related to an extinction
event of infectious diseases. Eventually, from a public health
perspective, lowering the average contact level of society is an
appropriate way to increase the robustness of strategies against the
occurrence of extinction. In the real world, reducing network density
can be accomplished by epidemic prevention activity, such as isolation
and quarantine treatment. This action prevents epidemic risk to the
society, thereby avoiding human extinction. Additional considerations
may improve our analysis. First, large population size and various
proportions of initial infective nodes were not considered in the
experiments. We have confirmed that the result was consistent when the
proportion of initial infective nodes was 0.05% of the total population;
however, this can vary depending on the distinct proportion of initial
infective nodes in a different population. To achieve robust results, we
need to perform additional experiments for various parameters; however,
we could not address this issue due to computational complexity. Second,
we did not consider numerous known epidemic diseases. We calculated the
transmission rates of epidemic diseases using the known infectious
periods and reproduction numbers of the epidemics from evidence in the
literature. In the present study, we only considered five epidemic
diseases, since the information on infectious periods and reproduction
numbers of diseases was mostly unavailable for other epidemic diseases.
Third, this study only considers the SIR model on scale-free networks in
epidemic simulation. Since the dynamics of epidemic diseases can be
varied in different models or networks, it is important to experiment in
various simulation environments to confirm the robustness of the
results. Nevertheless, these limitations can be considered in future
experiments or using improved computational methods. With these further
improvements, our approach can be used as a computational tool to
analyze the risk of epidemic diseases. 5. Conclusions In this study, we
analyzed the risk of epidemic diseases by creating an epidemic
simulation on a scale-free network. Based on the **[simulation
results]{.underline}** for various epidemic parameters, we
**[confirmed]{.underline}** that [certain infectious **diseases** can
lead to **extinction**]{.underline} and can be prevented by minimizing
human contact. We believe that identifying potential candidate diseases
that may lead to human extinction is crucial in addressing epidemic
prevention activities such as quarantine.

#### [Host-independent]{.underline} disease [bypasses]{.underline} burnout

In considering the importance of biological warfare as a subject for
concern [it is worthwhile to review the known existential
threats]{.underline}. At this time [this writer can
identify]{.underline} at three major existential threats to humanity:
(i) large-scale thermonuclear war followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a
planet killing asteroid impact and (iii) [infectious
disease]{.underline}. To this trio might be added climate change making
the planet uninhabitable. Of the three existential threats the first is
deduced from the inferred cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. For the
second there is geological evidence for the association of asteroid
impacts with massive extinction (Alvarez, 1987). As to an existential
threat from microbes [[recent decades]{.mark} have [provided
**unequivocal** evidence for]{.mark} the ability of certain pathogens to
cause the [extinction]{.mark} of entire species. Although infectious
disease has traditionally not been associated with extinction this view
has changed by the finding that a single chytrid fungus was responsible
for]{.underline} the [extinction of numerous amphibian
species]{.underline} (Daszak et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 2006).
[[**Previously**, the view]{.mark} that infectious diseases were not a
cause of extinction [was predicated]{.mark} on the notion
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} many **[[pathogens required]{.mark} their
[hosts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} that [some proportion of
the host population was naturally resistant]{.underline}. However,
[[that]{.mark} calculation [**does not apply** to
microbes]{.mark}]{.underline} [that are]{.underline} [[acquired]{.mark}
**directly [from the environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and have no
need for a host, such as]{.underline} the majority of [fungal pathogens.
For those]{.underline} types of host--microbe interactions [[it is
possible]{.mark} for the pathogen [to kill]{.mark} off **[every]{.mark}
last [member of a species]{.mark}** [without harm]{.mark} to itself,
since it would return to its natural habitat]{.underline} upon killing
its last host. Hence, [from the viewpoint of **[existential
threats]{.mark}** environmental [microbes]{.mark} could potentially
[pose a]{.mark} **much [great]{.mark}er [threat to
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the known pathogenic microbes,
which number somewhere near 1500 species (Cleaveland et al., 2001;
Taylor et al., 2001), especially if some of these species acquired the
capacity for pathogenicity as a consequence of natural evolution or
bioengineering.

#### There's [no]{.underline} upper limit to virulence

Karl-Heinz **Kerscher 14**, Professor, "Space Education",
Wissenschaftliche Studie, 2014, 92 Seiten

The death toll for a pandemic is equal to the virulence, the deadliness
of the pathogen or pathogens, multiplied by the number of people
eventually infected. [[It has been **hypothesized**]{.mark} that [there
is an **upper limit** to]{.mark} the **[virulence]{.mark}** of naturally
evolved pathogens. This is [because a pathogen that quickly
kills]{.mark} its hosts [might not]{.mark} have enough time to
[spread]{.mark}]{.underline} to new ones, while one that kills its hosts
more slowly or not at all will allow carriers more time to spread the
infection, and thus likely out-compete a more lethal species or strain.
This simple model predicts that if virulence and transmission are not
linked in any way, pathogens will evolve towards low virulence and rapid
transmission. [However, [this]{.mark} assumption [is **not**]{.mark}
**always [valid]{.mark}** and in more complex models, where the level of
virulence and the rate of transmission are related, **[high]{.mark}
levels** of [virulence can **evolve**]{.mark}. The level of virulence
that is possible is instead limited by the existence of complex
populations of hosts, with different susceptibilities to infection, or
by some hosts being geographically isolated]{.underline}. The size of
the host population and competition between different strains of
pathogens can also alter virulence. [[There are **numerous**]{.mark}
**historical [examples]{.mark}** [of pandemics that]{.mark} have
[had]{.mark} a [**devastating effect** on a **large number**]{.mark} of
people, [which makes]{.mark} the [possibility of **global pandemic** a
**realistic threat** to]{.mark} **human
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The devastating impact of [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 has
[highlighted global vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological
events]{.underline}. The international community was woefully unprepared
for [a pandemic]{.underline} that has [[led to millions of deaths and
trillions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars [[in]{.mark} economic
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, and has upended daily life. However,
notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[[COVID]{.underline}-]{.mark}19, it [[should be viewed as a **warning
shot**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 It will not be the last pandemic humanity
faces, and [[the next]{.underline}]{.mark} high-consequence [[biological
event could be]{.underline}]{.mark} as destructive or [[substantially
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}. We define [[global catastrophic biological
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} (GCBRs) as biological events of tremendous
scale that [[could cause **severe damage to human
civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially [[jeopardizing]{.mark}
its]{.underline} long-term **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has also developed a working
definition of GCBRs,3 and this term is part of a broader discussion
about global catastrophic risks that could arise from a variety of
sources, including nuclear war, anthropogenic climate change, and
advanced artificial intelligence that has not been sufficiently
safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs could be caused by]{.mark} a naturally emerging
[infectious disease]{.mark} outbreak, [an accidental release of a
pathogen, or a deliberate attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Naturally
emerging infectious disease outbreaks that can grow into]{.mark}
[pandemics are likely to increase in frequency ]{.mark}]{.underline}due
to urbanization, globalization, and environmental degradation, and the
world faces an increasing risk of high-consequence biological events
resulting from accidental or deliberate misuse of the tools of modern
bioscience and biotechnology.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics
will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as
others have defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the
threshold for this type of event is extremely high. [Although COVID-19
does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it has demonstrated
that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact]{.underline}, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders
that the world needs much more robust protections against
high-consequence biological events that could emerge in the future and
be substantially worse. In our view, human-caused biological events
involving the accidental or deliberate misuse of an [engineered pathogen
are more likely to lead to a GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging
pandemic.9 [Scientists have the capacity to]{.mark} deliberately or
inadvertently [engineer pathogens]{.mark} [that are more virulent and
transmissible]{.mark} than what nature creates by chance,
and]{.underline} the upper limit of damage that could be caused by a
human-engineered biological event is unknown.10-12 [[Prevention, **early
detection**, and **rapid response** are all crucial for guarding against
GCBR-scale events]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, in this article, we
focus on effective strategies for preventing biological events that
could become GCBRs, specifically by disincentivizing development and use
of biological weapons by states and other powerful actors.

Historically, [[disease]{.mark} events have been [responsible for the
**greatest death tolls**]{.mark}]{.underline} on humanity. [[The]{.mark}
1918 [flu was]{.mark} responsible for more than]{.underline} **[[50
million]{.mark} deaths]{.underline}**,1 while smallpox killed perhaps 10
times that many in the 20th century alone.2 [The [Black Death
was]{.mark} responsible for killing over **[25% of]{.mark} the
[Europe]{.mark}an population**]{.underline},3 while other pandemics,
such as the plague of Justinian, are thought to have killed 25 million
in the 6th century---constituting over 10% of the world's population at
the time.4 It is an open question whether a future pandemic could result
in outright human extinction or the irreversible collapse of
civilization. [A skeptic would have many **good reasons**]{.underline}
[to think that **existential risk from [disease]{.mark} is
unlikely**]{.underline}. [Such a disease [would]{.mark} need to
**[spread worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline} to remote populations,
[[overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} **[rare genetic
[resistances]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[evade
[detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[cures]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[countermeasures]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Even
**evolution itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} may work in humanity's favor:
Virulence and transmission is often a trade-off, and so evolutionary
pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type pathogens.5,6
[While these arguments point to a very small risk of human extinction,
they [do not **rule the possibility out**]{.mark}]{.underline} entirely.
Although rare, [there are recorded instances of species
going]{.underline} **[extinct]{.underline}** [due to disease---primarily
in amphibians, but also in 1 mammalian species]{.underline} of rat on
Christmas Island.7,8 [[There are]{.mark} also historical [examples of
large]{.mark} **human [populations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[being]{.mark} **almost entirely [wiped out]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by
disease, especially [when **multiple diseases were**
]{.mark}**simultaneously [introduced]{.mark}**]{.underline} into a
population without immunity. The most striking examples of total
population collapse include native American tribes exposed to European
diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and theWestern Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population). In the modern
context, [no single disease currently exists that combines the
worst-case levels of **transmissibility**]{.underline},
**[lethality]{.underline}**, [resistance to countermeasures, and global
reach]{.underline}. But [many diseases are proof of principle that
**[each worst-case attribute can be realized]{.mark}**]{.underline}
independently. For example, [some diseases exhibit nearly a 100% case
fatality ratio in the absence of treatment]{.underline}, such as rabies
or septicemic plague. Other diseases have a track record of spreading to
virtually every human community worldwide, such as the 1918 flu,10 and
seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens, such as chickenpox
and HSV-1, can successfully reach over 95% of a population.11,12 Under
optimal virulence theory, natural evolution would be an unlikely source
for pathogens with the highest possible levels of transmissibility,
virulence, and global reach. But advances in biotechnology might allow
the creation of diseases that combine such traits. Recent controversy
has already emerged over a number of scientific experiments that
resulted in viruses with enhanced transmissibility, lethality, and/or
the ability to overcome therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments
demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case
fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modified as well.19-2

-- MoState JG

[[Overall]{.mark}, the [risk seems substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}
We've seen a variety of estimates regarding the chances of an
existential biological catastrophe, including the possibility of
engineered pandemics.17 Perhaps the best estimates come from the
[Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT).]{.underline} This project
involved getting [groups of both subject matter experts and experienced
forecasters to estimate the likelihood of extreme events]{.underline}.
[For biological risks, the]{.underline} [range of median estimates
between forecasters and domain experts were as follows: Catastrophic
event (meaning an event in which [10% or more of the human population
dies]{.mark}) by 2100: [\~1--3%]{.mark} [Human extinction event: 1 in
50,000 to 1 in 100]{.mark}]{.underline} Genetically engineered pathogen
killing more than 1% of the population by 2100: 4--10%18 Note: the
[forecasters tended to have lower estimates of the risk than domain
experts]{.underline}. Although they are the best available figures we've
seen, these numbers have plenty of caveats. The main three are: There is
little evidence that anyone can achieve long-term forecasting accuracy.
Previous forecasting work has assessed performance for questions that
would resolve in months or years, not decades. There was a lot of
variation in estimates within and between groups --- some individuals
gave numbers many times, or even many orders of magnitude, higher or
lower than one another.19 The domain experts were selected for those
already working on catastrophic risks --- the typical expert in some
areas of public health, for example, might generally rate extreme risks
lower. It's hard to be confident about how to weigh up these different
kinds of estimates and considerations, and we think reasonable people
will come to different conclusions. **[Our view is that [given how bad a
catastrophic pandemic would be]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the fact that
there seems to be few limits on how destructive an engineered pandemic
could be, and how broadly beneficial mitigation measures are, [**[many
more people should be working on this problem]{.mark}** than current
are]{.underline}. **[[Reducing catastrophic bio]{.mark}logical [risks is
highly valuable]{.mark}]{.underline}** [according to a range of
worldviews]{.underline} Because we prioritise world problems that could
have a significant impact on future generations, we care most about work
that will reduce the biggest biological threats --- especially those
that could cause human extinction or derail civilisation. But
biosecurity and catastrophic risk reduction could be highly impactful
for people with a range of worldviews, because: [Catastrophic
[bio]{.mark}logical [threats would harm near-term interests
too]{.mark}.]{.underline} As COVID-19 showed, **[[large
pandemics]{.mark} [can bring extraordinary costs]{.mark} to people
today, [and]{.mark} even more virulent or deadly diseases would [cause
even greater death and suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Interventions
that reduce the largest]{.mark} biological [risks]{.mark} [are also
often beneficial for preventing more common
illnesses]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Disease surveillance can detect both
large and small outbreaks]{.underline}; counter-proliferation efforts
can stop both higher- and lower-consequence acts of deliberate misuse;
better [PPE could prevent all kinds of infections]{.underline}; and so
on. [**[There is]{.mark} also [substantial overlap between biosecurity
and other world problems]{.mark},** such as global health]{.underline}
(e.g. the Global Health Security Agenda), [factory farming]{.underline}
(e.g. 'One Health' initiatives), [and AI]{.underline}.

### Yes Disease\-\--Knock-On Effects

Natural Global Catastrophic Risks," *Natural Hazards*, 115(3), pp.

Once the pathogen has infected humans, it is spread primarily via human
activity.17 The risk is heavily affected by modern global civilization.
On one hand, modern medicine and public health creates more powerful
techniques for reducing the severity of pandemics. On the other hand,
[[**global travel** and **urban density** create]{.underline}]{.mark}
more [[opportunities for pathogens]{.mark} to **spread**.
**[Earlier]{.mark}** in human history, a catastrophic]{.underline}
natural [[pathogen may have only killed]{.mark} off a
**[smaller]{.mark}**]{.underline}, isolated [[portion of]{.mark} the
[population]{.mark}, leaving **no**]{.underline} clear archaeological
[**record**, whereas the same pathogen could cause **global
catastrophe**]{.underline} (Manheim 2018). Therefore, the [**[deep
historical evidence]{.mark}** is [**consistent**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} even [a **[high]{.mark}**]{.underline} ongoing
[[**probability** of **human extinction** from]{.underline}]{.mark}
natural [[pandemics]{.mark}, implying]{.underline} that natural
[pandemic risk can be of **large**]{.underline} long-term moral
**[importance]{.underline}** even if w(cc) is small.

[[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} could further [[threaten **civilization
collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Pandemics [could
[disrupt]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**labor pool**,
causing]{.underline}]{.mark} acute [supply chain [disruptions]{.mark}
with]{.underline} severe [effects]{.underline} such as [[to **food
security**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Huff et al. 2015). A [pandemic causing
**neurological harm**]{.underline}, such as in long COVID (Misra 2021),
[[could result in]{.underline}]{.mark} the human [population having
[insufficient **cognitive fitness**]{.mark} to maintain
civilization]{.underline}. Furthermore, [these]{.underline} sorts of
[effects could have occurred]{.underline} during pandemics earlier [in
human history **without** leaving a]{.underline} noticeable
[trace]{.underline}. Supply chain disruptions would have been of minimal
consequence for most of human history. Medical effects such as
neurological harm could go away, for example, if it is not passed to
subsequent generations. If w(cc) is large, the potential effects of
pandemics on civilization collapse merit careful scrutiny.

One particularly complex and acute pandemic scenario is when a [pandemic
[causes]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[failure of]{.mark} **stratospheric
[geoengineering]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Stratospheric geoengineering
involves injecting particles into the stratosphere to counteract the
harms of anthropogenic global warming. [If particle injection is
**abruptly halted**[, temperatures **rapidly rise**]{.mark}, which could
cause **acute harm**]{.underline} known as termination shock (Parker and
Irvine 2018). [Under **normal circumstances**, abrupt cessation of
particle injection may be **unlikely**]{.underline} due to the desire to
avoid termination shock. However, Baum et al. (2013) propose that [a
catastrophe such as a **pandemic** could cause]{.underline} the
[**cessation** of particle injection, [resulting in a "**double
catastrophe**"]{.mark} in which]{.underline} the [harms of termination
shock **[compound]{.mark}** the [harms of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[initial catastrophe]{.mark}**. This may be]{.underline} an
[**especially severe** pandemic]{.underline} scenario. It is also a
scenario rooted in interactions between the natural hazard and human
civilization. Further complicating the picture, prior to termination
shock, stratospheric geoengineering could shift climates in a way that
shifts disease vector patterns, potentially affecting the risk of
"natural" pandemics (Tang and Kemp 2021).

[Even more than]{.underline} the fundamental [efficacy]{.underline} of
these new tools, [it is the [deskilling]{.mark} that they engender that
[is central to]{.mark} their [threat]{.mark} potential in the terrorist
context.]{.underline} [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} these
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark},
the [[levels of]{.mark} education, technical [skill and experience
required to engineer]{.mark} a microorganism [are
reduced]{.mark}.]{.underline} 28 For example, in 2017, a relatively
small Canadian biotechnology company called Tonix synthesised the
horsepox virus, Footnote29 which is harmless to humans but is in the
same family as smallpox, which decidedly is not. At the same time,
[**[globalising forces]{.mark}** such as online education, marketplaces
for used laboratory equipment and lowering costs of equipment
[mean]{.mark} that this **[deskilling can rapidly spread]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} even the most unstable regions of the world where
[terrorists]{.mark} and other violent groups thrive,]{.underline} thus
further "democratising" the technology. Footnote30 As an example, the
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition brings
together hundreds of teams of high school and undergraduate students
annually from all over the world, and the winning entries represent
levels of sophistication that several years ago were the exclusive
domain of experienced personnel in advanced laboratories. Footnote31
Moreover, [advances in **[biotech]{.mark}**nology [are inherently **dual
use**]{.mark}, and, unlike nuclear weapons technology, they have
multiple beneficial applications (especially in fighting disease)
[and]{.mark} employ techniques that [quickly become
ubiquitous]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is feared that these [factors]{.underline}, [resulting
from]{.underline} the [enormous strides in]{.underline} **[[modern
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, [will [allow
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, even at the level of [small [non-state
groups or]{.mark} perhaps [individuals, to]{.mark}
essentially]{.underline} first **[[design a disease capable of
existential]{.mark} levels of [harm]{.mark} and [then produce a
pathogen]{.mark} with the required characteristics [to fit]{.mark} the
design]{.underline}**. Footnote32 Such [an **[engineered
pathogen]{.mark}** could conceivably **[disregard]{.mark}** the
generally observed **[inverse relationship between]{.mark}** a
pathogen's **[lethality and]{.mark}** its
**[transmissibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Footnote33 [Nor would
aspiring world-killers be limited to traditional pathogens: **[novel
harm agents]{.mark}**, ranging from transmissible cancers and
bacteriophages to genetic modifications of neurochemistry, [could also
be]{.mark} [considered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The key question becomes how likely it is that terrorists or other
misanthropic individuals will be able to realise biotechnology's most
extreme potential for harm. Expert opinion differs. Some regard the
threat as overblown, citing persistent technical obstacles to the
realisation of the capabilities described above, especially for
non-state actors. Footnote34 After all, there is much we still do not
know, especially in the realms of epigenetics, pleiotropic effects (one
gene having multiple effects), polygenes (multiple genes acting in
concert to have an effect) and epistatic (modifier) genes. Others
contend that, "[[As]{.mark} the molecular engineering
[techniques]{.mark} of the synthetic biologist [become more robust and
widespread]{.mark}, the **[probability]{.mark}** of encountering one or
more of these threats [is **approaching
certainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Footnote35 A recent study by the
National Academies of Science, Medicine and Engineering described the
bottlenecks to modifying and creating pathogens but acknowledged that
[most if not all of these could be overcome in time]{.underline},
Footnote36 with most observers agreeing that the more complex and exotic
achievements will take longer to arrive. However, [even if all of the
obstacles are not surmountable today, the rapid forward march of
biotechnology suggests that, at some point in the not-too-distant
future, terrorists might be capable of brandishing an existential-level
microbe]{.underline}.

[The consequences of a major pandemic would be
world-changing]{.underline}. [The 1918 flu pandemic killed]{.underline}
50 million to 100 million people\--at the top end, [more than the
combined total casualties of World Wars I and II]{.underline}\--and for
a slew of reasons[, [humans are]{.mark} arguably [more
vulnerable]{.mark} today [than]{.mark} they were [100 years
ago.]{.mark}]{.underline} First of all, there are simply more of us. The
number of people on the planet has doubled in the past 50 years, which
means [more humans to get infected and to infect others]{.underline},
[especially in densely populated cities]{.underline}. Because [[people
no longer stay in one place]{.mark}\--nearly [4 billion trips were
taken]{.mark} by air last year\--neither do diseases]{.underline}. [[An
infection]{.mark} [in]{.mark} all but [the most remote corner]{.mark} of
the world [can make its way to a major city **in a day or
less**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Climate change also plays a
role]{.underline} as [warmer temperatures expand the range of
disease-carrying animals and insects we\'re exposed to, like the Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes that]{.underline} [transmit Zika.]{.underline} And if
nature isn\'t bloody-minded enough, [[genetic-engineering tools]{.mark}
have [made it easier for terrorist groups or lone madmen to unleash
custom-designed killer germs]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of a new
pandemic, modern medicine should provide some protection. But experts
say it\'s more likely that we\'ll be caught without a vaccine to prevent
it or a drug ready to treat it. That\'s true even with many known
viruses. When the last Ebola outbreak exploded, in 2014, eventually
killing more than 11,000 people, the virus wasn\'t a mystery to
scientists; it was discovered in 1976. But even though it had been
killing people on and off for decades, there were no drugs or vaccines
approved to fight it\--and there still aren\'t today, chiefly because
there\'s little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to bring them to
market. [There are troubling economic implications as well]{.underline}.
The 2003 [SARS]{.underline} epidemic, which killed fewer than 800
people, [cost the global economy \$54 billion]{.underline}, much of it
in lost trade, transportation disruption and health care costs. [The
World Bank estimates that the toll from [a severe flu pandemic could
hit]{.mark} \$[4 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. One saving grace is that
the scientific understanding of that risk is better than ever. Research
groups are working feverishly to predict the next pandemic before it
even happens. They\'re cataloging threats and employing next-generation
genetic-sequencing tools to speed the discovery of new or mysterious
viruses. They\'re helping identify and track outbreaks as they happen.
But [[microbes evolve]{.mark} about [40 million times as fast]{.mark} as
humans do, [and]{.mark} [we are losing ground]{.mark}]{.underline}.
\"[**[Of all]{.mark} the things [that can kill millions]{.mark} of
people [in very short order]{.mark}**,\" says Dr. Ashish Jha, director
of the Harvard Global Health Institute, \"**the one that is most likely
to occur over the next 10 years is a pandemic**.\" The question is how
policy\--and the government dollars that back it\--can]{.underline}
catch up with the science and [keep the world safe.]{.underline}

### Yes Disease\-\--Probability (!calc)

#### It's the [most probable]{.underline} existential threat

Thomas **Such 21**, Writer for the Glasgow Guardian, "How to Wipe Out
Humanity",
https://glasgowguardian.co.uk/2021/02/09/how-to-wipe-out-humanity/

Not only is a virus the key to [**[a]{.mark}**n unpredictable
[disease]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[may]{.mark} one day **[wipe out
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but the origins of said virus are key.
My "research" concluded that the most efficient way of killing humanity
is to have the disease spread in a semi-developed country such as China;
it is far easier for viruses and other diseases to spread in less
developed countries - but in order to successfully achieve global
transmission, a host country must have the substantial international
infrastructure to spread a pandemic worldwide. Using this strategy in my
"research", I was able to play a game of Plague Inc. wherein the spread
and threat of Covid-19 seemed minimal by using China as a perfect
starting point to wipe out humanity. The key, as it turns out, is the
[[spreading]{.mark} of the virus]{.underline} - something that Covid-19
has proved [[can be done]{.mark} **very [easily]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
our modern **[globalised society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The journey
from China to Italy spreading the plague across Europe took almost 40
years back in the middle ages: in 2020, [it took [a mere **40
days**]{.mark} for widespread outbreaks to begin]{.underline} in Italy
spreading across much of Europe.

My research into the historical spread of pandemics and my attempts to
create my destroyer of humanity illustrates a significant disparity
between what happens in the real world and the measures one may find in
a simulator. Political realities and measures many may consider
"draconian" or simply unrealistic heavily impact how a pandemic may
spread and the eventual impact it will have on humanity. Using Plague
Inc., I was able to effectively kill off humanity in around a year using
a fast transmission of [[virus]{.underline}]{.mark}, which also
[[became]{.mark} gradually **[more lethal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
is essential to ensure the near-universal transmission of the virus, and
to penetrate measures such as increased border security and isolated
regions once the knowledge of the pandemic spreads. Whilst it is
unlikely that humanity will be wiped out any time soon, it became clear
to me that [[instead of **nuclear war**]{.underline}]{.mark}, alien
invasion [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the looming threat of [**global
[warming]{.mark}**[; the **real threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.mark} humanity and the eventual **[destruction of our
species]{.mark}** may [come from]{.mark} something as simple as
**[bacteria]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While we like to revel in our
scientific advancements of the modern era and the ascension of humans as
Earth's alpha species, it becomes clear that, when we adapt, our
environment and the threats it poses adapt with us. [Plague Inc. showed
a **clear pathway** to killing off humanity]{.underline} - though,
luckily, the Covid-19 threat in the program was combated due to immense
political pressure, restrictions and record-making vaccine paces. The
real threat, however, remains clear: if humanity becomes increasingly
lax with preventive and managerial measures, it is obvious what the
future may hold for us.

A central question for risk assessment is whether intact viruses survive
decades to millennia entrained in permafrost. [[Attempts]{.mark},
however, [to isolate infectious]{.mark} smallpox and 1918 flu
[viruses]{.mark} and to recover long nucleic acid fragments (as a proxy
for intact virus) [have **failed**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[92, 93\],
[[suggesting that **survival** of]{.mark} these [human-infectious
viruses]{.mark} may be [**limited in permafrost** and]{.mark} that
[**concerns** about their release]{.mark} to a susceptible and
vulnerable populace may **[not]{.mark} be as
[warranted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Survival of viruses that infect non-human hosts is also important for
wildlife managers. [[Most viruses identified in cold soils]{.mark}
infect bacterial hosts and **[do not pose a direct risk to human
health]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[94, 95\], so those targeting non-human
eukaryotic hosts are a more appropriate proxy. The most well-known
example is the revival of "giant" viruses from ancient permafrost that
infect Acanthamoeba (widespread amoebae) \[85, 96\]. In contrast to
viruses such as the 1918 Flu virus, these viruses may be better adapted
to harsh environments due to the formation of rugged stable capsids
\[97\] and for their hosts to form robust cysts, resulting in resistance
to extremes in temperature and pH \[98, 99\]. Cysts formed during
infection can act as a reservoir, protecting the virus and enabling
reemergence under favorable conditions.

[[For permafrost viruses to infect humans]{.mark} or for a
humaninfectious virus to remain intact even during thaw before
encountering a susceptible host, [it must undergo a **host
shift**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the possibility of these events
cannot be entirely disregarded, [the [risk]{.mark}s [of such occurrences
are]{.mark} likely **[low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The evolutionary
distance between microeukaryotes and humans is a substantial barrier to
host-shifting as successful host-shifting decreases as the phylogenetic
distance between hosts increases \[100\]. Similar to the giant
Acanthamoeba-infecting viruses, microeukaryotes in cold soils and their
viruses have co-evolved in harsh conditions through geologic time
\[101\], explaining why they survive in permafrost. Viruses with human
hosts do not have this evolutionary history. They lack cold adaptations
and a host that facilitates persistence.

Many microbes such as Bacillus anthracis form spores and can persist for
long periods of time in inhospitable environments including permafrost.
The best-described outbreak was in 2016 in Siberia. It killed thousands
of reindeer, sickened dozens of humans, and killed one \[102\]. However,
[it is likely that **[permafrost thaw alone is not enough to cause
disease]{.mark}**, and that [multiple factors have to act
synergistically for a disease outbreak to occur. **Environmental
conditions**]{.mark} have to be conducive for the pathogen to survive
and human behavior [including **reduced animal and human vaccination**
and an **increase of herd size**]{.mark} may be [**key** to facilitating
disease **spread**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[102\].

INTRODUCTION

The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and unprecedented changes due to
global warming with average increasing by more than 2°C since the 1950s,
which is twice as fast as the global average. This has led to the
melting of glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, which are key components
of the Arctic ecosystem and climate system \[1\]. [**Permafrost** is the
permanently frozen ground that lies beneath much of the **Arctic land
surface**. This thick layer of [permafrost]{.mark} is [being
**disrupted**]{.mark} as Arctic temperatures are rising, which [has
**dramatic consequences for human society**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such
as exacerbating climate change by releasing greenhouse gases from the
decomposition of previously trapped organic material and [endangering
human health by [triggering the **metabolic reactivation of**]{.mark}
**various microorganisms**]{.underline} \[1,2\]. [These pathogens have
been trapped beneath this layer for nearly **500,000 years** and pose a
**serious threat if released** into the environment. One of the most
intriguing and alarming aspects of permafrost thawing is the possibility
of **reviving [ancient viruses]{.mark}** that have been frozen for
**millennia**]{.underline} \[3\]. [These viruses, also known as **zombie
viruses** or **[Methuselah microbes]{.mark}**, have been inactive for a
long time, but [could]{.mark} be **reactivated** by the Earth's warming
climate and [cause a **major disease outbreak**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[4, 5\]. Researchers have already isolated some strains of these zombie
viruses and demonstrated that they are still capable of infecting host
cells, even though they have been buried in permafrost for thousands of
years. These viruses could infect humans with diseases from the distant
past that our immune systems may have never encountered, and that could
be resistant to current treatments \[4\]. Therefore, these viruses
represent a potential pandemic threat that needs to be monitored and
controlled.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The aim of this short article is to provide an overview of the current
state of knowledge on the zombie viruses, their origin, diversity,
infectivity, and impact on human health and the environment along with
the challenges and opportunities for monitoring, prevention, and control
of these emerging pathogens, as well as the role of social media and
public education in raising awareness and combating misinformation.
ORIGIN, DIVERSITY, AND INFECTIVITY The term zombie virus refers to
viruses that have been inactive for a long time, but could be revived by
environmental changes. The term is also used in fiction to describe a
pathogen that transforms humans into undead creatures that spread the
infection by biting. It is a metaphor for the unknown and the mysterious
in infectious disease fiction, as well as an allegory of a communicable
disease that serve as a symbol of the sick or the disease in their
horde-like behaviour and reveals the patterns of contagion and the
disaster among communities. The origin of the zombie viruses is not
clear, but scientists believe that they may have been frozen in the
permafrost during the last ice age, which lasted from about 2.6 million
years ago to about 11,700 years ago. During this period, the Earth
experienced several cycles of glacial and interglacial periods, which
affected the climate, the sea level, and the distribution of life forms.
The permafrost formed as a result of the accumulation of snow and ice
that did not melt during the summer, and that preserved the organic
matter and the microorganisms that were trapped within it. The
permafrost may contain viruses that are up to a million years old and so
will be far older than our own species, which is thought to have emerged
about 300,000 years ago \[6\]. "Our immune systems may have never been
in contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry," said
Jean-Michel Claverie, a geneticist from Aix-Marseille University who has
been studying the zombie viruses \[7\]. The diversity of the zombie
viruses is also unknown, but researchers have identified several
different viral strains from various sites in Siberia and other regions
of the Arctic. These viruses belong to different families and genera,
such as Pandoravirus, Pithovirus, Megavirus, and Pacmanvirus, which are
among the largest and most complex viruses known to science. They have
genomes that range from 500,000 to 2.5 million base pairs, which is
larger than some bacteria and archaea, along with some unique
morphological features, such as icosahedral or amphora-shaped capsids,
and unusual replication cycles, such as infecting the host cell nucleus
or forming viral factories in the cytoplasm. These viruses are mainly
found to infect single-celled organisms, such as amoebae, which are
abundant and diverse in the permafrost. However, some of these viruses
may also have the potential to infect multicellular organisms, such as
plants, animals, and humans. For example, researchers have detected
genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known
human pathogens, in some of the permafrost samples. In 2018, researchers
recovered microscopic nematode worms that were frozen in Siberian soil
for 42,000 years. The researchers confirmed that the animals that moved
and ate after being placed in nutrient-rich Petri dishes at 20 °C were
not contaminated samples \[8\]. The infectivity of the zombie viruses is
also uncertain, but researchers have demonstrated that some of them are
still able to infect host cells after being frozen for thousands of
years. For example, Claverie and his team isolated a virus that was
48,500 years old from a permafrost sample in Siberia, and showed that it
could still infect an amoeba species called Acanthamoeba castellanii
\[7\]. This virus, named Pandoravirus yedoma, is the oldest frozen virus
to become infectious. It is older than the 30,000-year-old virus
identified in Siberia in 2013, which was also isolated by Claverie\'s
team \[7\]. The researchers used Acanthamoeba as a virus bait, as it is
a common host for many large viruses. They also used strict biosafety
measures to prevent contamination and spread of the viruses to the
laboratory workers and the environment which emphasized that the viruses
they isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to
humans. However, they warned that other viruses, currently frozen in the
permafrost, might be able to trigger illnesses in humans. "We have to
assume that something like this could happen," said Dr. Marion Koopmans,
a virologist from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who has been
collaborating with Claverie \[9\]. To investigate the diversity and
function of these ancient viruses, a team of researchers led by Dr.
Lonnie Thompson and Dr. Matthew Sullivan from Ohio State University
conducted a metagenomic analysis of two ice core samples collected from
the Guliya ice cap on the Tibetan Plateau, which is located at an
altitude of 6.7 kilometers and has an estimated age of 15,000 years
\[10\]. The researchers used a combination of advanced techniques, such
as sterile drilling, decontamination, and ultra-low temperature
processing, to minimize the risk of contamination and preserve the
integrity of the samples. The team found that the ice cores contained a
rich and diverse viral community, with 33 viral populations identified,
of which 28 were novel and had no close relatives in the public
databases \[10\]. They then compared the viral genomes to those of known
viruses and inferred their possible hosts and functions which allowed
them to discover that the most abundant viruses in both samples were
bacteriophages that infect Methylobacterium, a genus of bacteria that
plays a key role in the methane cycle within ice. These phages showed
high similarity to those found in Methylobacterium strains from plant
and soil habitats, suggesting that they originated from terrestrial
sources and were transported to the ice cap by dust and wind \[10\]. The
researchers also found that these phages had genes that could enhance
the nutrient uptake and metabolism of their hosts, indicating that they
had a mutualistic relationship with the bacteria which enabled them to
also characterize the novel viruses and find that they had unique
features that enabled them to survive and infect cells in extreme cold
environments. These features included signatures of genes that encode
for cold-shock proteins, antifreeze proteins, ice-nucleation proteins,
and cold-adapted enzymes. It was speculated that these viruses were
adapted to the harsh conditions of the ice cap and could infect
psychrophilic (coldloving) microorganisms. The researchers concluded
that these ancient viruses provide a valuable window into the past
atmospheric and environmental conditions, as well as the evolutionary
history of viruses. They also warned that the melting of the ice cap
could pose a potential threat to the current biosphere, as some of the
viruses may be able to infect humans or other animals. This calls for
more research and surveillance on the emerging viruses from the
permafrost, as they may have unpredictable consequences for the global
health and ecology.

**new global medical emergency**]{.mark}, not by an illness new to
science, but [by a **disease from the**]{.mark} **distant
[past]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These viruses could infect humans with
diseases [that we have **no immunity or treatment for**]{.mark}, such as
an **[ancient form of polio, smallpox, or
influenza]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11\]. [They could also [introduce
**new genetic elements**]{.mark} or [**resistance factors** into the
**existing** microbial populations]{.mark}, which could affect their
**evolution and adaptation**]{.underline} \[12\]. This could also alter
the ecological balance and the biogeochemical cycles of the Arctic
region, which will have global implications. [[The]{.mark} zombie
[viruses]{.mark} could be [released]{.mark} into the environment
[by]{.mark} various factors, such as [**permafrost thawing**,
**mining**, **drilling**, **construction**, **tourism**, and
**migration**]{.mark}. Permafrost thawing is the main factor that could
expose these viruses to the outside world]{.underline}, as it is driven
by climate change and affects a large area of the Arctic. [It not only
releases the viruses, but also other pathogens, such as bacteria and
fungi, that have been frozen for a long time along with organic matter,
such as plant and animal remains, that decomposes]{.underline} and emits
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which further
contribute to climate change and permafrost thawing. [Permafrost
[thawing]{.mark} also [affects the]{.mark} physical and chemical
[properties of the soil,]{.mark} the [water, and]{.mark} the [air,
which]{.mark} could [affect the **survival and transmission** of
the]{.mark} zombie [viruses]{.mark} and other
microorganisms]{.underline}. However it is not the only factor that
could release the zombie viruses into the environment. [[Human
activities]{.mark}, such as mining, drilling, construction, tourism, and
migration, could also [**disturb the permafrost** and **expose**
the]{.mark} zombie [viruses to the **outside
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These activities]{.mark} could [also
**increase the contact and the exposure** of humans and animals to the
viruses]{.mark} and other microorganisms, [which]{.mark} could
[facilitate the **infection and the spread** of the
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in 2016, an anthrax outbreak
occurred in Siberia, killing more than 2,300 reindeer and infecting
dozens of people, including a 12-year-old boy who died \[6\]. The
outbreak was linked to the thawing of a reindeer carcass that was
infected with anthrax and buried in the permafrost for decades. The
carcass was exposed by the melting of the permafrost and the rising of
the water level, and the anthrax spores were dispersed by the wind and
the water. The outbreak was also facilitated by the high density and the
movement of the reindeer herds, as well as the lack of vaccination and
the delay in the diagnosis and the treatment of the infected people and
animals. The outbreak was contained by the intervention of the
authorities, who vaccinated the reindeer and the people, and burned the
carcasses and the contaminated soil \[6\]. This was a wake-up call for
the potential dangers of permafrost thawing and the need for
preparedness and prevention.

Bacillus anthracis, the agent of **[anthrax]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
common disease of livestock and occasionally of humans \[20, 21\]. [The

Introduction: The lingering danger of a post-antibiotic era

Antibiotic resistance is on the rise and humanity is currently heading
towards [[a **post-antibiotic era**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although this
scenario is unlikely to lead to the complete extinction of humanity, it
[[poses an **existential threat**]{.mark}, as one of the most important
means of fighting infections would then have become
**ineffective**]{.underline}, resulting in the death of millions of
people. Despite the fact that international bodies such as the World
Health Organization have put this issue on the global political agenda,
it continues to grow as problem. However, the actual danger posed by
antibiotic resistance, which is essentially of anthropogenic origin
(Mitchell et al. 2019: 1), does currently not correspond to its
recognition as an immediate threat to humanity on a social, or more
precisely on a societal level. Not even notorious catchwords like
"superbugs" (Stolberg 1998) seem to be enough to bring the issue into
public awareness. As of now, "warnings and crisis framings do not appear
sufficient to prompt a response. Public attention and governmental
action have lagged." (Engström 2021: 19).

[A post-antibiotic era is, simply put, "[a new era in which bacteria
have become resistant to existing antibiotics and]{.mark} the
antibiotics **[no longer work]{.mark}**."]{.underline} (Hansson/Brenthel
2022: 381). Like some other current and anticipated future crises, such
as the climate crisis, [**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic
**[r]{.mark}**esistance is [develop]{.mark}ing [day by day beyond
our]{.mark} collective **[perception]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This lack
of awareness could make the current antibiotic crisis even more
dangerous, as the absence of adequate threat perception is likely to
reduce the willingness to tackle the problem. Picking up on these
aspects, the guiding thesis of the paper at hand is, that, contrary to
their widespread perception, [**[a]{.mark}**nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic
**[r]{.mark}**esistance [and]{.mark} the [**post-antibiotic age** are an
**existential danger to humanity** in form of a **global and
intergenerational threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The arguments to
substantiate this claim are unfolded in three main steps: First, we will
give an overview of the role of antibiotics and the occurring resistance
in modern medicine. Building on this and taking a global perspective, we
will highlight the current scope of the problem and elaborate on the
prognosis of its future escalation, revealing the intergenerational
nature of the issue at hand. Afterwards, we will focus on potential
attempts to tackle antibiotic resistance and prevent a post-antibiotic
era by elaborating on the possibility of a way out and its obstacles,
before concluding the proposed arguments.

Already, [these negative effects have taken their toll on humanity's
potential to provide [antibacterial]{.mark} medical
treatment]{.underline}. As such "\[o\]ur ability to cure infections that
were once considered benign is already damaged." (O'Neill 2016: 10).
[The **[danger]{.mark}** of this becomes [particularly clear when
considering]{.mark} not only [the **possibility** and **impact** of a
**global spread**]{.mark} of bacterial infections, but also [the
**speed** with which this can happen in a **globalised world**]{.mark}
connected by fast and almost non-stop traffic by land, sea, and
air]{.underline}. Of course, bacterial spread depends on various
factors, such as the respective specificity, overall survivability, and
potency of transmission, but despite this, [in the worst case [such a
spread could become **devastating** for humankind]{.mark}, [as]{.mark}
e.g., the [**plague pandemics** demonstrate **throughout
history**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even without any major hotspots of
bacterial outbursts, it is estimated that there are currently more than
670,000 infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria per year in the
European Union alone, resulting in roughly 33,000 deaths. Globally,
untreatable bacterial infections account for not 700,000 deaths (not:
infections) annually (cf. WHO Regional Office for Europe/European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control 2022: xiv; Antão/Wagner-Ahlfs 2018:
501, Davies et al. 2013: xii). According to recent findings by the
Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators (2022: 629, 639), the problem is
even bigger, with 4.95 million deaths worldwide associated with
antibiotic resistance, of which 1.27 million are directly caused by
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. So although there are some significant
geographical differences, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
currently most threatened by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, antibiotic
resistance is a health problem of global proportions.

Against this background, [it becomes evident that cautionary or alarming
statements according to which "[AMR is a looming threat]{.mark} to the
health of millions of people worldwide"]{.underline} (WHO Regional
Office for Europe/European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
2022: xii) **[do not describe an apocalyptic scenario of a distant
future]{.underline}**. After all, humanity is already in midst of an
antibiotic crisis. As Friedman et al. (2016: 421) remind us, "resistance
and MDR (multiple drug resistance, the authors) bacteria have spread and
the negative impacts of antibiotic resistance have become more apparent"
for decades. Despite the fact that the problem continues to grow,
however, the danger of antibiotic is still commonly underestimated. As
problematic as current developments may be, they are "only the tip of
the iceberg" (Davies et al. 2013: 36), as [[the dangers of
**a**]{.mark}nti**[b]{.mark}**iotic **[r]{.mark}**esistance [that lie
ahead are **even bigger**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The way we try to
counteract, reduce, or prevent already existing antibiotic resistance
today has enormous impacts both on current use of antibiotics but also
on the future. This is the case for those alive today as well as the
generations yet to be born. This is because antibiotic resistance and
its effects are somewhat comparable "to a slow-motion car crash: sadly,
it is one that has already started" (O'Neill 2016: 71) and that cannot
be prevented anymore. In particular, this is due to the irreversible
failures and omissions that have occurred to date. Historical and
current overuse, misuse, and abuse of antibiotics, as well as negligence
of investment, research, and development of new antibiotics or adequate
alternatives have put future generations at risk of losing effective
means to treat bacterial infections.

On its current path, humanity is heading for a future escalation of the
problems described, which will not only lead to poorer health care and
an increase in the number of deaths, but also to severe economic
consequences, as "\[t\]he impact of AMR on economic growth will result
in a pronounced increase in extreme poverty." (World Bank 2017: 22) One
of the commonly cited prognoses "estimate\[s\] that by 2050, 10 million
lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at
risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections" (O'Neill 2016: 4 and
12). This very prominent projection must be taken with caution,
especially because of its rather speculative nature due to the opaque
methodology (Kraker et al. 2016; Foreman et al. 2018: 2085; O'Neill
2014). However, it cannot be dismissed entirely. One may reasonably
disagree about the extent of the problem, but its current trajectory is
crystal clear: Humanity is not putting enough effort into addressing the
problem of antibiotic resistance and averting the scenario of a
post-antibiotic era (Engström 2021: 21). Since our current handling of
antibiotics and antibiotic resistance have a very significant impact on
the future, this becomes not only a long-term issue, but also a question
of intergenerational justice. For as medically and morally defensible as
some of our current antibiotic use may be, it (re)imposes the extreme
vulnerability to bacterial infections that has plagued humanity for most
of its existence on future generations. The danger is imminent, because
„[[if we allow resistance to **increase**]{.mark}, in a few decades
[we]{.mark} may [start dying from the most **commonplace**]{.mark} of
[ailments]{.mark} that can today be treated easily]{.underline}."
(Davies et al. 2013: x)

Conclusion: The (un)avoidable era of deadly bacteria upon us?

Overall, [[it is **not impossible** to avert the]{.mark} grim
**[post-antibiotic era]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which millions of
people die each year from untreatable bacterial infections that
scientists and organisations like the World Health Organization keep
warning the global community about. Therefore, [[Combating
**A**]{.mark}nti**[m]{.mark}**icrobial
**[R]{.mark}**esistance]{.underline} and Protecting the Miracle of
Modern Medicine (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2022) [is not a lost cause. At present,]{.underline} however,
success is unlikely, and realistically, [the **[goal]{.mark}** of the
initiatives taken [can only be to **reduce** or]{.mark} at least [**slow
down** the problem]{.mark}s at hand]{.underline}, not to completely
avert the dangers outlined. Given the problem's current scope, [[it
is]{.mark} not [a question]{.mark}]{.underline} of whether antibiotic
resistance is going to hit humanity, but only [[of **how hard** it will
hit it and **how much** of an existential threat this
poses]{.underline}]{.mark}. The past omissions in areas such as research
and development, as well as the widespread failure to use antibiotics
rationally, demonstrate a lack of political and societal commitment to a
serious change in the way antibiotics are used. Furthermore, attempting
to stop antibiotic resistance does come at a price -- the most pressing
one being the potential exposure of current patients to health risks in
order to spare future ones.

## No Econ War

#### Economic decline [doesn't]{.underline} link to [war]{.underline}. [Empirics]{.underline} prove that leaders [avoid]{.underline} wars that aren't [quick]{.underline}, [cheap]{.underline}, and a [sure]{.underline}-[thing]{.underline}\-\--econ wars are [none]{.underline} of those things. 

**Walt '20** \[Stephen Walt, Professor of International Relations at

War?"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>
// ***mosuQ***\]

On balance, however, [I [do not think]{.mark} that [even]{.mark} the
**[extraordinary economic conditions]{.mark}** we are witnessing
today are going to [have much **impact** on the **likelihood
of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions were a
powerful **cause** of war, there would be **a lot more** of the
latter]{.underline}. To take one
example, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has suffered **40**]{.mark}** or more
[recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the country was
founded, [yet it
has [fought]{.mark} perhaps **[20]{.mark} interstate [wars]{.mark}**,
most of them [**unrelated** to the]{.mark} state
of the **[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To paraphrase the economist
Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, if recessions were
a powerful cause of war, they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five (or fewer)."

Second, [states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and relatively cheap victory**]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, national
leaders avoid war when they are convinced it will
be long, bloody, costly, and uncertain. [To choose war, political
[leaders have to convince themselves they can]{.mark} either [win a
**quick, cheap, and decisive victory**]{.mark} or achieve some limited
objective at low cost]{.underline}. Europe went to war in 1914 with each
side believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi Germany
developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as
quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [No matter what a country's economic condition might
be, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do
so quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability
of success]{.underline}.

Third, and most important, [[the primary motivation]{.mark} for most
wars [is the desire for **security,
not economic gain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this reason, the odds of
war increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may be
shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed
that "every war between Great Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\]
... started as a preventive war, not as a war of conquest," and that
remains true of most wars fought since then.

The bottom line: Economic conditions (i.e., a depression) may affect the
broader political environment in which decisions for war or peace are
made, but they are only one factor among many and rarely the
most significant. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has [[large, lasting,
and negative effects
on the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}---as seems quite
likely---it is [[**not likely** to affect the **probability
of war**]{.mark} very much, especially in the short term]{.underline}.

First, [[**war can occur** at **any stage** of **expansion**]{.mark},
**[crisis]{.mark}**, **[recession]{.mark}**,
**[recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so [it is **[unrealistic to

[**stage**]{.mark} of the business cycle]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[**[although]{.mark}** the domestic economic [problems in]{.mark} the

become prominent [in]{.mark} a **[short time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
fact, [**such [challenge exists]{.mark}** [at **all stages**]{.mark} of
the business **cycle**]{.underline}. When countries cannot manage to
solve these problems through conventional approaches, including fiscal
and monetary policies, they may resort to military expansion to achieve
their goals, a theory known as Lateral Pressure. \[13\] Under such
circumstances, even countries in the period of economic expansion are
facing downward pressure on the economy and may try to solve the problem
through expansion. On the other hand, although the resources required
for foreign wars are huge for countries in economic depression, the
[[**decision to wage wars** **depends**]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} the
[**consideration** of]{.mark} the **[gain and loss of
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even during depression, governments can
raise funding for war by issuing bonds. Argentina, for example, was
mired in economic stagflation before the war on the Malvinas islands
(also known as the Falkland islands in the UK). In fact, many
governments would dramatically increase their expenditure to stimulate
the economy during the recession, and economically war is the same as
these policies, so the claim that a depressed economy cannot support a
war is unfounded. In addition, during the crisis period of the business
cycle, which is the early stage of the economic downturn, despite the
economic crisis and potential depression, the country still retains the
ability to start wars based on its economic and military power. Based on
the above understanding, [[war]{.mark} has [the conditions and reasons
for]{.mark} its [outbreak in all stages of the]{.mark} business
[cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, [[the economic origin for]{.mark} the outbreak of [war is
**downward pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the economy rather than
optimism or competition for monopoly capital, [[which **may exist
during**]{.underline}]{.mark} economic recession or economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is due to a fact that
[**[during]{.mark}** economic **[prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[people are also **worried** about]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic
**[[recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Blainey pointed out that wars
often occur in the economic upturn, which is caused by the optimism in
people\'s mind \[14\], that is, the confidence to prevail. This
interpretation linking optimism and war ignores the strength contrast
between the warring parties. Not all wars are equally comprehensive, and
there have always been wars of unequal strength. In such a war, one of
the parties tends to have an absolute advantage, so the expectation of
the outcome of the war is not directly related to the economic situation
of the country. Optimism is not a major factor leading to war, but may
somewhat serve as stimulation. In addition, Lenin attributed the war to
competition between monopoly capital. This theory may seem plausible,
but its scope of application is obviously too narrow. Lenin\'s theory of
imperialism is only applicable to developed capitalist countries in the
late stage of the development capitalism, but in reality, many wars take
place among developing countries whose economies are still at their
beginning stages. Therefore, the theory centered on competition among
monopoly capital cannot explain most foreign wars. Moreover, even wars
that occur during periods of economic expansion are likely to result
from the potential expectation of economic recession, the \"limits of
growth\" \[15\] faced during prosperity --- a potential deficiency of
market demand. So the downward pressure on the economy is the cause of
war.

"Diversionary cheap talk: economic conditions and US foreign policy
rhetoric, 1945-2010", International Interactions, Volume 46, Issue 2,

There is a large literature on diversionary conflict in international
relations, but it focuses on material conflicts like militarized
interstate disputes rather than foreign policy rhetoric. It is based in
social identity theory, which suggests that leaders can increase ingroup
affinity by making intergroup distinctions more salient (Coser 1956;
Simmel 1955; Tajfel and Turner 1979). A recent review concludes that
**[though the internal logic of [diversionary]{.mark} conflict is
"compelling and theoretically well supported," the empirical
[evi]{.mark}dence [is]{.mark} "decidedly [mixed]{.mark}"]{.underline}**
(Baum and Philip 2008, 48). **[Several studies find evidence of
diversionary aggression in US foreign policy]{.underline}** (Clark 2003;
DeRouen 2000; DeRouen and Peake 2002; Fordham 1998a,b; Hess and
Orphanides 1995; Howell and Pevehouse 2005; James and Hristoulas 1994;
James and Oneal 1991; Levy 1989a, 1989b; Clifton and Bickers 1992;
Ostrom and Job 1986) and elsewhere (Bennett 2000; Dassel and Reinhardt
1999; Davies 2002; Enterline and Gleditsch 2000; Gelpi 1997; Heldt 1999;
Lebow 1981; Mansfield and Snyder 1995; Oneal and Tir 2006; Russett 1990;
Sobek 2007; Tir 2010). **[Yet skeptics have amassed opposing
evidence]{.underline}** (Chiozza and Goemans 2003, 2004; Foster and
Palmer 2006; Gowa 1998; Johnston 1998; Leeds and Davis 1997; Lian and
Oneal 1993; Meernik 2004, 2000; Meernik and Waterman 1996; Moore and
Lanoue 2003; Potter 2007). **[Some [cases are hard to reconcile with
the]{.mark} theory]{.underline}**: in Britain, there were rallies in the
Falklands War and the Gulf War but not in other cases in which rallies
would be expected, such as the Korean, Suez, and Kosovo wars (Lai and
Reiter 2005). **[Some go so far as to call diversionary aggression a
"[myth]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Meernik and Waterman 1996).

Others have developed scope conditions for diversionary aggression. It
is more likely between states with pre-standing rivalries (Mitchell and
Prins 2004), when leaders are accountable (Carter 2018; Kisangani and
Pickering 2011), and in mature democracies, consolidating autocracies,
and transitional polities (Pickering and Kisangani 2005). It is less
likely when states avoid provoking troubled rivals (Clark 2003; Fordham
2005; Leeds and Davis 1997; Miller 1999). Diversion appears more likely
to produce a rally when supported by Security Council authorization
(Chapman 2011; Chapman and Reiter 2004), when the White House draws
attention to a dispute (Baker and Oneal 2001), and in conditions of
media attention, popular leadership, divided government, non election
years, and first terms (Colaresi 2007). Most recently, scholars have
asked whether diversion occurs outside democracies. They find some
autocracies, especially single party regimes, divert as well (Carter
2018; Pickering and Kisangani 2010).

This study extends the logic of diversionary conflict to foreign policy
rhetoric. **[There is surprisingly little research on
rhetoric]{.underline}** in international relations. The international
relations literature deems talk "cheap" (Fearon, 1995; Kydd, 2005). The
audience cost literature considers rhetoric meaningful, but only if it
invokes audience costs through explicit, public threats (Fearon, 1994;
Schultz, 2001; Smith, 1998; Tomz, 2007).

However, if foreign policy **[rhetoric]{.underline}** can activate
ingroup identity, then it **[may be appealing for leaders who wish to
improve their ratings without incurring the substantial risks of
militarized interstate disputes]{.underline}**. Domestic political
factors like low presidential approval ratings can lead otherwise
rational states to choose "suboptimal" foreign policies (Fearon 1998).
**[Diversionary rhetoric represents optimization inside the bounds of
domestic political constraints. While it might be "outlandish" for
presidents to engage in the impeachable exercise of diversionary
war]{.underline}** (Meernik and Waterman 1996), **[hostile foreign
policy rhetoric is far less outlandish a risk]{.underline}**.

To develop a theory of diversionary cheap talk, **[this]{.underline}**
paper **[draws upon research in [political psychology]{.mark} and
political communication. These literatures [find]{.mark} [persuasive
ev]{.mark}idence that]{.underline}** elite statements influence citizen
beliefs (Behr and Iyengar, 1985; Bennett, Lawrence and Livingston, 2006;
Brody, 1991; Cohen, 1995; Jentleson, 1992; Zaller and Chiu, 2000). I
draw on social identity theory to argue that **[diversionary [cheap
talk]{.mark}]{.underline}** highlights intergroup differences between
nations and **[[leads citizens to]{.mark} evaluate their [leader
favorably]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} When a leader criticizes
foreigners, she cues ingroup identity, which increases citizens' social
attachment to the nation and to herself as its leader. This is a
"solidarity mechanism," through which "\[c\]ollective group goals and
common group identity are highlighted, norms of groupbased altruism are
strengthened, punishment and rejection of defectors are increased, and
perceptions of the in-group and out-group are manipulated" (Halevy,
Bornstein and Sagiv, 2008, 405).

The theory generates observable implications about when leaders use
diversionary cheap talk and who they target. **[I follow the consensus
in the diversionary conflict literature in focusing on poor economic
conditions as the most important source of public disapproval for
leaders]{.underline}**. Low approval ratings limit leaders' ability to
advance their domestic agenda. Therefore, **[when the economy
deteriorates, leaders will criticize foreign nations to improve their
approval ratings and restore the political capital necessary for them to
govern]{.underline}**.

Second, a key observation from social identity theory is that the depth
of intergroup differences is important for group attachment. Therefore,
consonant with recent empirical findings in the diversionary conflict
literature (Mitchell and Prins 2004), I expect diversionary rhetoric to
be most effective when it targets threatening outgroups. In the context
of foreign policy, these are best represented by historical rivals.
Finally, I expect diversionary cheap talk to have differential partisan
effects. The solidarity mechanism suggests that because national
identity cues widen the tent of the political ingroup, diversionary
cheap talk should be most effective at boosting support among the
leader's nonpartisans: conservative voters for Democratic presidents,
and liberal voters for Republican presidents. However, this solidarity
mechanism is mediated by citizens' foreign policy preferences. Liberals
prefer more dovish foreign policy and hence might interpret diversionary
rhetoric from Republican presidents as too extreme. In contrast,
Republicans prefer more hawkish foreign policy and therefore are likely
to reward Democratic presidents for hostile rhetoric. Therefore,
diversionary rhetoric should be most powerful for Democratic presidents,
whose non-core voters are most likely to reward such rhetoric.

**[[I test]{.mark} these hypotheses with]{.underline}** the American
Diplomatic Dataset, an original record of **[over [50,000]{.mark} US
diplomatic [events]{.mark}]{.underline}** between 1945 and 2010 drawn
from New York Times articles on foreign affairs. I used tools from
computational social science to classify bilateral interstate
interactions into hundreds of specific types and four aggregate
categories: rhetorical cooperation, rhetorical conflict, material
cooperation, and material conflict. **[This is by far [the most]{.mark}
historically [extensive]{.mark} event [dataset]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
As such, **[it allows an exploration of US foreign policy behavior
[across]{.mark} a variety of [administrations and]{.mark} economic
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Crucially, **[the granularity of the
dataset]{.underline}** allows me to **[restrict attention to events
which the sitting US president initiated and directed at foreign state
actors.]{.underline}**

**[I find robust evidence of diversionary cheap talk in US foreign
policy]{.underline}**. First, I establish that **[US [presidents]{.mark}
face incentives [to divert verbally rather than materially]{.mark}:
while militarized interstate dispute initiation does not affect
presidential approval ratings, hostile foreign policy rhetoric is
associated with increased ratings]{.underline}**, especially for
Democratic presidents among Independent and Republican citizens.
Responding to this incentive, Democratic presidents between 1945 and
2010 typically diverted in the form of words, not deeds. Simulations
indicate that as the misery index of unemployment plus inflation varies
from its observed minimum to its observed maximum, predicted hostile
foreign policy rhetoric doubles. Throughout this study, estimates are
conservative: I operationalize conflict as events the United States
initiated, although findings are robust to a redefinition of conflict as
events the United States participated in. The **[rhetorical
statements]{.underline}** in the dataset **[are high profile and likely
to be noticed by the American public]{.underline}**: all appeared in the
headlines of the New York Times, the American newspaper of record in the
postWorld War II era.

This study contributes to existing scholarship in several ways. First,
it demonstrates that US foreign policy rhetoric may be shaped by
domestic economic conditions. International relations scholars should
therefore continue to focus more seriously on the communicative aspects
of foreign policy, and in particular its relationship to domestic
politics (Johnston 2001, 2008; Kurizaki 2007; Ramsay 2011; Sartori 2002,
2005; Trager 2010, 2011, 2016). The American Diplomacy Dataset will
enable researchers to further explore the communicative aspects of
foreign policy, and their relationships to material and economic
factors, in more detail than existing datasets permit.

Second, **[this]{.underline}** study **[contributes to the diversionary
conflict literature by showing that in many cases where diversionary
theory predicts conflict initiation, leaders may instead choose
rhetorical hostility]{.underline}**. In this sense, **[[leaders]{.mark}
may [have their cake and eat it too]{.mark}: [They benefit from]{.mark}
an ingroup [rally without]{.mark} inviting an international
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[mixed empirical findings in the
diversionary conflict literature may be]{.underline}** partly **[due to
the fact that existing scholarship considers only the most serious forms
of diversion like militarized interstate disputes]{.underline}**. It is
possible that **[a wide range of diversionary behavior takes place at
less extreme levels, such as]{.underline}** the **[rhetorical
hostility]{.underline}** documented in this paper.1

**[socioeconomic]{.underline}** [vulnerabilities will be]{.underline}
**[amplified]{.underline}** [in the near term, with looming concerns
about]{.underline} an **[Economic downturn]{.underline}** (Chapter 1.5),
resurgent risks such as Interstate armed conflict (Chapter 1.4), and
rapidly evolving risks like Misinformation and disinformation (Chapter
1.3). As discussed in last year's Global Risks Report, less predictable
and harder-to-handle [[inflation heightens]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[risk of miscalibration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of efforts

1.5: Economic uncertainty). Economic [risks are]{.underline}
**[notable]{.underline}** new entrants to the top 10 rankings this year,
with both Inflation (#7) and Economic downturn (#9) featuring in the
two-year time frame (Figure 1.3). Economic risks are prioritized in
particular by public- and private-sector respondents (Figure 1.5).
Geoeconomic confrontation (#14) is a marked absence from the top 10
rankings this year (Figure 1.4) and has decreased in perceived severity
compared to last year's scores. However, like related economic risks, it
features among the top concerns for both public- and private-sector
respondents (at #10 and #11, respectively) as a continuing source of
economic volatility. \[Figures omitted\] Misinformation and
disinformation has risen rapidly in rankings to first place for the
two-year time frame, and the risk is likely to become more acute as
elections in several economies take place this year (Chapter 1.3: False
information). Societal polarization is the third-most severe risk over
the short term, and a consistent concern across nearly all stakeholder
groupings (Figures 1.5 and 1.6). Divisive factors such as political
polarization and economic hardship are diminishing trust and a sense of
shared values. The [erosion of]{.underline} **[social
cohesion]{.underline}** [is leaving]{.underline} **[ample]{.underline}**
[room for new and evolving risks to propagate in turn]{.underline}.
Societal polarization, alongside [[**Economic downturn**,
is]{.underline}]{.mark} seen as one of [the]{.underline} **[[most
central risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [in the]{.underline}
**[interconnected]{.underline}** ["risks network", with the]{.underline}
**[greatest potential]{.underline}** [[to trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}
and be influenced by [[other risks]{.underline}]{.mark} (Figure 1.7).
\[Figures omitted\] Interstate armed conflict (#5) rises in the rankings
for the two-year horizon, across nearly all stakeholder groups, except
for government respondents. This divergence may simply reflect different
views around defining conflict: interstate armed conflict in the strict
definition has remained relatively rare thus far, but international
interventions in intrastate conflict are on the rise (Chapter 1.4: Rise
in conflict). Extreme weather events, a persistent concern between last
year and this year, is at #2, Cyber insecurity at #4, Involuntary
migration at #8 and Pollution at #10, rounding out the top 10 concerns
in respondents' risk perceptions through to 2026. Overall, global risks
have lower severity scores compared to last year's results.7 Further
down in the two-year time frame rankings, Critical change to Earth
systems comes in at #11, Debt in 16th place, and Adverse outcomes of AI
technologies and other frontier technologies in 29th and last place,
respectively. The following sections explore some of the most severe
risks that many expect to play out over the next two years, focusing on
three entrants to the top 10 risks list over the short term:
Misinformation and disinformation (#1), Interstate armed conflict (#5)
and Economic downturn (#9). We briefly describe the latest developments
and key drivers for false information, a rise in conflict and economic
uncertainty, and consider their emerging implications and knock-on
effects. False information \[Figure omitted\] Misinformation and
disinformation may radically disrupt electoral processes in several
economies over the next two years. A growing distrust of information, as
well as media and governments as sources, will deepen polarized views --
a vicious cycle that could trigger civil unrest and possibly
confrontation. There is a risk of repression and erosion of rights as
authorities seek to crack down on the proliferation of false information
-- as well as risks arising from inaction. The disruptive capabilities
of manipulated information are rapidly accelerating, as open access to
increasingly sophisticated technologies proliferates and trust in
information and institutions deteriorates. In the next two years, a wide
set of actors will capitalize on the boom in synthetic content,8
amplifying societal divisions, ideological violence and political
repression -- ramifications that will persist far beyond the short term.
Misinformation and disinformation (#1) is a new leader of the top 10
rankings this year. No longer requiring a niche skill set, easy-to-use
interfaces to large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models have
already enabled an explosion in falsified information and so-called
'synthetic' content, from sophisticated voice cloning to counterfeit
websites. To combat growing risks, governments are beginning to roll out
new and evolving regulations to target both hosts and creators of online
disinformation and illegal content.9 Nascent regulation of generative AI
will likely complement these efforts. For example, requirements in China
to watermark AI-generated content may help identify false information,
including unintentional misinformation through AI hallucinated
content.10 Generally however, the speed and effectiveness of regulation
is unlikely to match the pace of development. Synthetic content will
manipulate individuals, damage economies and fracture societies in
numerous ways over the next two years. Falsified information could be
deployed in pursuit of diverse goals, from climate activism to conflict
escalation. New classes of crimes will also proliferate, such as
non-consensual deepfake pornography or stock market manipulation.11
However, even as the insidious spread of misinformation and
disinformation threatens the cohesion of societies, there is a risk that
some governments will act too slowly, facing a trade-off between
preventing misinformation and protecting free speech, while repressive
governments could use enhanced regulatory control to erode human rights.
Mistrust in elections Over the next two years, close to three billion
people will head to the electoral polls across several economies,
including the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Mexico and
Indonesia (Figure 1.9).12 The presence of misinformation and
disinformation in these electoral processes could seriously destabilize
the real and perceived legitimacy of newly elected governments, risking
political unrest, violence and terrorism, and a longer-term erosion of
democratic processes. Recent technological advances have enhanced the
volume, reach and efficacy of falsified information, with flows more
difficult to track, attribute and control. The capacity of social media
companies to ensure platform integrity will likely be overwhelmed in the
face of multiple overlapping campaigns.13 Disinformation will also be
increasingly personalized to its recipients and targeted to specific
groups, such as minority communities, as well as disseminated through
more opaque messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat.14 The
identification of AI-generated mis- and disinformation in these
campaigns will not be clear-cut. The difference between AI- and
humangenerated content is becoming more difficult to discern, not only
for digitally literate individuals, but also for detection mechanisms.15
Research and development continues at pace, but this area of innovation
is radically underfunded in comparison to the underlying technology.16
Moreover, even if synthetic content is labelled as such,17 these labels
are often digital and not visible to consumers of content or appear as
warnings that still allow the information to spread. Such information
can thus still be emotively powerful, blurring the line between malign
and benign use. For example, an AI-generated campaign video could
influence voters and fuel protests, or in more extreme scenarios, lead
to violence or radicalization, even if it carries a warning by the
platform on which it is shared that it is fabricated content.18 The
implications of these manipulative campaigns could be profound,
threatening democratic processes. If the legitimacy of elections is
questioned, civil confrontation is possible -- and could even expand to
internal conflicts and terrorism, and state collapse in more extreme
cases. Depending on the systemic importance of an economy, there is also
a risk to global trade and financial markets. State-backed campaigns
could deteriorate interstate relations, by way of strengthened sanctions
regimes, cyber offense operations with related spillover risks, and
detention of individuals (including targeting primarily based on
nationality, ethnicity and religion).19 \[Figure omitted\] Societies
divided Misinformation and disinformation and Societal polarization are
seen by GRPS respondents to be the most strongly connected risks in the
network, with the largest potential to amplify each other. Indeed,
polarized societies are more likely to trust information (true or false)
that confirms their beliefs. Given distrust in the government and media
as sources of false information,20 manipulated content may not be needed
-- merely raising a question as to whether it has been fabricated may be
sufficient to achieve relevant objectives. This then sows the seeds for
further polarization. As identified in last year's Global Risks Report
(Chapter 1.2: Societal polarization), the consequences could be vast.
Societies may become polarized not only in their political affiliations,
but also in their perceptions of reality, posing a serious challenge to
social cohesion and even mental health. When emotions and ideologies
overshadow facts, manipulative narratives can infiltrate the public
discourse on issues ranging from public health to social justice and
education to the environment. Falsified information can also fuel
animosity, from bias and discrimination in the workplace to violent
protests, hate crimes and terrorism. Some governments and platforms,
aiming to protect free speech and civil liberties, may fail to act to
effectively curb falsified information and harmful content, making the
definition of "truth" increasingly contentious across societies. State
and non-state actors alike may leverage false information to widen
fractures in societal views, erode public confidence in political
institutions, and threaten national cohesion and coherence. Trust in
specific leaders will confer trust in information, and the authority of
these actors -- from conspiracy theorists, including politicians, and
extremist groups to influencers and business leaders -- could be
amplified as they become arbiters of truth. Defining truth False
information could not only be used as a source of societal disruption,
but also of control, by domestic actors in pursuit of political
agendas.21 Although misinformation and disinformation have long
histories, the erosion of political checks and balances, and growth in
tools that spread and control information, could amplify the efficacy of
domestic disinformation over the next two years.22 Global internet
freedom is already in decline and access to wider sets of information
has dropped in numerous countries.23 Falls in press freedoms in recent
years and a related lack of strong investigative media, are also
significant vulnerabilities that are set to grow.24 Indeed, the
proliferation of misinformation and disinformation may be leveraged to
strengthen digital authoritarianism and the use of technology to control
citizens. Governments themselves will be increasingly in a position to
determine what is true, potentially allowing political parties to
monopolize the public discourse and suppress dissenting voices,
including journalists and opponents.25 Individuals have already been
imprisoned in Belarus and Nicaragua, and killed in Myanmar and Iran, for
online speech.26 \[Figure omitted\] The export of authoritarian digital
norms to a wider set of countries could create a vicious cycle: the risk
of misinformation quickly descends into the widespread control of
information which, in turn, leaves citizens vulnerable to political
repression and domestic disinformation.27 GRPS respondents highlight
strong bilateral relationships between Misinformation and
disinformation, Censorship and surveillance (#21) and the Erosion of
human rights (#15), indicating a higher perceived likelihood of all
three risks occurring together (Figure 1.10). This is a particular
concern in those countries facing upcoming elections, where a crackdown
on real or perceived foreign interference could be used to consolidate
existing control, particularly in flawed democracies or hybrid regimes.
Yet more mature democracies could also be at risk, both from extensive
exercises of government control or due to trade-offs between managing
mis- and disinformation and protecting free speech. In January last
year, Twitter and YouTube agreed to remove links to a BBC documentary in
India.28 In Mexico, civil society has been concerned about the
government\'s approach to fake news and its implications for press
freedom and safety.29 Rise in conflict \[Figure omitted\] [[Escalation

The [world has become]{.underline} **[significantly less]{.underline}**
[peaceful over the past decade]{.underline}, with conflict erupting in
multiple regions last year.30 Active conflicts are at the highest levels
in decades, while related deaths have witnessed a steep increase, nearly
quadrupling over the two-year period from 2020 to 2022 (Figure 1.12),
largely attributable to developments in Ethiopia and Ukraine. While
difficult to attribute to a single cause, **[longer-term
shifts]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} geopolitical power, **[[economic
fragility]{.underline}]{.mark}** and limits to the efficacy and capacity
of international security mechanisms [have]{.underline} all [contributed
to this surge]{.underline}. Interstate armed conflict (#5) is a new
entrant to the top 10 risk rankings this year. Specific [flashpoints

resources of major powers]{.underline} over the next two years,
**[degrading]{.underline}** [global security and]{.underline}
**[destabilizing]{.underline}** the global financial system and [supply

**[rapidly]{.underline}** [expanding]{.underline} humanitarian [crises

High-stakes hotspots Over the next two years, the attention and
resources of global powers are likely to be focused on three hotspots in
particular: the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza conflict and tensions
over Taiwan. [Escalation in]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** one of
these [hotspots would]{.underline} **[radically disrupt]{.underline}**
global [supply chains]{.underline}, financial markets, [security
dynamics and political stability]{.underline},
**[viscerally]{.underline}** [threatening the]{.underline} sense of
security and safety of individuals **[world]{.underline}**wide. All
three areas stand at a geopolitical crossroads, where major powers have
vested interests: oil and trade routes in the Middle East, stability and
the balance of power in Eastern Europe, and advanced technological
supply chains in East Asia. Each could lead to broader regional
destabilization, directly drawing in major power(s) and escalating the
scale of conflict. All three also directly involve power(s) reckoned to
possess nuclear capabilities. Over the next two years, the war in
Ukraine could sporadically alternate between intensifying and
refreezing. Despite sanctions, Russia has continued to benefit from
energy profits and commodity exports -- and this could increase further
if the conflict in the Middle East widens.31 Pro-Russian or neutral
sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe could soften support from
Ukraine's European allies,32 while support in the United States could
wane under domestic pressures, other international priorities, or under
a new government. Global divisions with respect to the Middle East
conflict may also complicate efforts by Ukraine to maintain unity with
Western allies, while also garnering support from the Global South.33 If
the conflict intensifies, it is still more likely to do so through
conventional rather than nuclear means, but it could also expand to
neighbouring countries. While post-conflict scenarios for both Ukraine
and Russia are difficult to predict, the war could 'refreeze' into a
prolonged, sporadic conflict that could last years or even decades.34
Proximate developments in the Middle East are a source of considerable
uncertainty, risking further indirect or direct confrontation between
global powers. If the Israel-Gaza conflict destabilizes into wider
regional warfare, more extensive intervention by major powers is
possible, including Iran and the West.35 Beyond potentially seismic
shocks to global energy prices and supply chains, escalation could split
the attention and resources of the EU and the United States between
Ukraine and Israel.36 The scale of Gulf countries' or Western
intervention is uncertain; it's likely to continue to be deeply
polarizing domestically and hold significant political sway. Numerous
GRPS respondents also cited Taiwan and disputed territories in East and
South-East Asia as areas of concern. In contrast to Russia, which
doubled its defense spending target to more than \$100 billion in 2023,
and the United States, which allocated over \$113 billion in assistance
relating to the war in Ukraine alone,37 China has largely acted as a
non-interventionist power in both the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts,
avoiding the risk of overstretch.38 While there is no evidence to
suggest that escalation is imminent, [there remains a]{.underline}
**[material]{.underline}** [possibility of]{.underline} **[accidental or
intentional]{.underline}** [outbreak of hostilities, given heightened
activity]{.underline} in the region.39 Conflict contagion As high-stakes
hotspots undermine global security, a [wider set of trends]{.underline}
may [fuel a]{.underline} **[combustible environment]{.underline}** [in
which new and existing hostilities are more likely to
ignite]{.underline}. As conflicts spread, [guardrails to]{.underline}
their **[containment]{.underline}** [are eroding and resolve for
long-term solutions have stalled]{.underline}.40 In parallel,
[the]{.underline} **[internationalization]{.underline}** [of
conflicts]{.underline} by a wider set of alternate powers
[will]{.underline} **[accelerate]{.underline}** 'multipolarity' and [the
risk of]{.underline} **[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**. First,
[simmering tensions and]{.underline} **[[frozen
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are proximate to existing hotspots
[could [heat up]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [spillover
impacts]{.underline} from a high concentration of conflicts, such as in
Asia and Africa (Figure 1.13), [could range from]{.underline} more
readily available **[arms trafficking]{.underline}** [to
conflict-driven]{.underline} **[migration]{.underline}**. Other [states
could]{.underline} also **[deliberately]{.underline}** [stoke tensions
in neighbouring countries to]{.underline} **[divert
attention]{.underline}** and resources, [through
disinformation]{.underline} campaigns [or the deployment of]{.underline}
state-backed [militia groups]{.underline}, for example. [Frozen
conflicts at risk]{.underline} could [[include]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[Balkans]{.mark}**, **Libya**]{.underline}, **[Syria]{.underline}**,
**[[Kashmir]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Guyana]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[Kurdish region]{.underline}** [[and
**Korea**]{.underline}]{.mark}n peninsula.41 [These risks
are]{.underline} **[well-recognized]{.underline}** by business leaders:
Interstate armed conflict features as a top-five risk in 20 countries
(18%) surveyed in the Forum's Executive Opinion Survey (EOS, see
Appendix C: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk Perceptions),
including Egypt, Iraq, Kazakhstan and Serbia, and is the top risk in
Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Japan. Second, resource stress,
economic hardship and weakened state capacity will likely grow and, in
turn, fuel conflict.42 There may also be a rise of 'ungoverned
countries', where non-state actors fight for control over large swathes
of territory, or where parties not recognized by the international
system gain full control. For example, resource-rich countries could
become caught in a battleground of proxy warfare between multiple
powers, including neighbouring economies, organized crime networks and
paramilitary groups (Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).43 \[Figure omitted\]
Third, with instant information networks and reinforcing algorithms, the
symbolism of high-stakes hotspots could trigger contagion beyond
conflict geographies. Deeply ingrained ideological grievances are in
some cases driving hostilities, and these divisions are resonating with
communities and political parties elsewhere. This expands beyond
religious and ethnic divisions to broader challenges to systems of
governance. National identities, international law and democratic values
are coming into question, contributing to civil unrest, threatening
human rights, and reigniting violence, including in advanced democracies
and between the Global North and South. North-South rift Dissatisfaction
with the continued political, military and economic dominance of the
Global North is growing, particularly as states in the Global South bear
the brunt of a changing climate, the aftereffects of pandemic-era crises
and geoeconomic rifts between major powers. Historical grievances of
colonialism, combined with more recent ones regarding the costs of food
and fuel, geopolitical alliances, the United Nations and Bretton Woods
systems, and the loss and damage agenda, could accelerate anti-Western
sentiment over the next two years. In conjunction with more thinly
spread resources and tighter economic conditions, military power
projection by the West could fade further, potentially creating power
vacuums in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. France, for
example, has withdrawn troops on request from Mali, Burkina Faso and
Niger over the past two years.44 As the dominance of long-held power
centres wanes, [alternate powers will compete for influence]{.underline}
in interstate and intrastate conflicts, potentially [leading
to]{.underline} **[deadlier, prolonged]{.underline}** proxy [warfare and
overwhelming]{.underline} humanitarian [crises]{.underline}.45 There are
a number of incentives to this involvement, from access to raw
resources, such as minerals and oil, to the protection and promotion of
trade, investment and security interests. Pivotal powers will also
increasingly lend support and resources to garner political allies,
taking advantage of this widening rift between the Global North and the
Global South. As a new set of influences in global affairs takes shape,
political alliances and alignment within the Global South will also
shape the longer-term trajectory of internationalized conflicts. A deep
divide on the international stage could mean that coordinated efforts to
isolate 'rogue' states may be increasingly futile, while international
governance and peacekeeping mechanisms shown to be ineffective at
'policing' conflict could be sidelined. Economic uncertainty \[Figure
omitted\] The near-term outlook remains highly uncertain due to domestic
factors in some of the world\'s largest markets as well as geopolitical
developments. Continued supply-side pressures and demand uncertainty
could contribute to persistent inflation and high interest rates. Small-
and medium-sized companies and heavily indebted countries will be
particularly exposed to slowing growth amid elevated interest rates.
According to one narrative, the global economy has shown surprising
resilience in the face of the most aggressive global tightening of
monetary policy in decades. Despite widespread predictions of a
recession in 2023 (Figure 1.15),46 the perception of a 'softer landing'
appears to be prevailing. Inflation is falling amid tight labour markets
and stronger-than-anticipated consumer spending and growth, particularly
in the United States.47 In another version, persistently elevated
[[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark} in many countries and high interest
rates are [[weigh]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[heavily on economic
growth]{.mark}, particularly in]{.underline} export- and
[manufacturing]{.underline}-led markets. An already visible [economic
[downturn]{.mark} is likely to]{.underline}
**[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[with]{.mark} a risk
that]{.underline} **[[new]{.underline}]{.mark}** [economic
[shocks]{.mark} would be]{.underline}
**[[unmanageable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in such]{.underline}
**[[fragility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[debt
[passes]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[the [tipping point]{.mark} of
sustainability]{.underline}. \[Figure omitted\] These contrasting
narratives encapsulate the highly uncertain economic outlook. Fears of
an Economic downturn are widespread among private-sector respondents,
featuring as a top-five risk in 102 countries (90%) surveyed in the EOS,
a significant uptick from 2022 (Figure 1.16). A slowdown in global
growth is already occurring, but it is taking place under a different
set of economic parameters than previous cycles, heightening
uncertainty. Over the next two years, there may be a lack of coherence
in forward projections within and between economies, particularly with
respect to inflation, interest rates and growth rates. With contrasting
views about the future, the risk of miscalibration by central banks,
governments and companies will rise accordingly, potentially deepening
and prolonging economic risks. Additionally, continued trade conflicts
and geoeconomic rifts between the United States, European Union and
China add to the significant economic uncertainty ahead. Supply-driven
price pressures Markets are already anticipating interest rate cuts in
key economies in the first half of this year.48 However, there are
several inflationary pressures that may stymie expectations and present
a less-smooth path to inflation targets. If price pressures continue,
central banks could be hesitant to cut rates in response to signals of
weaker growth, resulting in higher-for-longer inflation and interest
rates. Reflecting tighter financial conditions, both headline and core
inflation have dropped in the United States and the Eurozone (Figure
1.17).49 In parallel, there has been a slowdown in economic growth in
key industries and markets. The global economy had been propped up by
continued strength in services throughout 2023, which is now flagging,
while manufacturing has already been in contraction for over a year
(Figure 1.18).50 Economic growth is stagnant in the European Union, at
0.6% last year, with estimates suggesting that the economic powerhouse
of Germany contracted by 0.3% in 2023.51 Profits of the S&P 500,
excluding the 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks, were estimated to contract by
8.6% last year.52 \[Figures omitted\] Yet even as inflation has been
partially tamed through higher interest rates, it has not reached
central bank targets of two percent and there remains a material risk of
largely supply-side price pressures over the next two years. For
example, El Niño-impacts to food production and logistics could drive
inflation and costly disruptions to supply chains. Any amplification of
the Middle East conflict could trigger price spikes in energy and
further disrupt shipping routes, compounding continued impacts from the
war in Ukraine.53 The cost-of-living impact of persistent inflation,
perceived to be declining in 2024, could resurge as the continued impact
of elevated prices persists. A wage-price spiral is still possible, with
EOS respondents anticipating labour shortages in key sectors and
economies over the next two years (Chapter 2.5: End of development?).
Stronger industrial policies and trade controls emanating from advanced
economies, targeting the green transition and advanced technology, could
also remain a persistent inflationary trend over this period.
Uncertainty within global powerhouses The outlooks for the two largest
economies -- China and the United States -- are highly complex, and
these two key sources of uncertainty could lead to unanticipated, and
possibly divergent, implications for the trajectory of the global
economy. China's economy is widely expected to slow this year, with the
weakening of the property market and local and external demand generally
cited as primary causes.54 Despite retaining its 'A1' long-term credit
rating, the outlook for China's government debt was recently downgraded
from 'neutral' to 'negative', reflecting risks relating to 'structurally
and persistently lower medium-term economic growth'.55 Yet investment in
both manufacturing and energy infrastructure have been key drivers of
growth in recent years, replacing lost construction demand to a
degree.56 Although challenges remain, in the absence of further shocks,
there is room for an upside surprise -- local consumption may revive,
growth may be less sluggish and the slowdown shallower than pervasive
market expectations. In addition, in the absence of further geoeconomic
backlash, excess capacity in advanced manufacturing, particularly in
green technologies, could help counteract global price pressures,
lending momentum to the green transition and global demand.57 There is
similar uncertainty in the United States. Some forecasts are already
pricing in up to 2.4% economic growth for 2024, and others predict rate
cuts in the early half of the year.58 Fiscal policy has remained loose
even as monetary policy tightened, with the United States running a
\$1.7 trillion deficit in 2023, effectively doubling the deficit in the
past year alone.59 This could continue to keep demand-driven price
pressures high. The correlation between consumer sentiment and spending
is also adding to uncertainty: economic pessimism may be widespread, but
it is not necessarily dampening demand -- yet.60 On the other hand, debt
servicing hit over \$981 billion in Q3 2023 -- an increase of over \$753
billion compared to the same period in 2022, a sum similar to the
budgetary spend on defense.61 Any fiscal consolidation in the United
States -- or a political stand-off relating to debt loads -- could have
a profound effect on global markets and trade, while any overestimation
of the slowdown could lead to earlier or sharper intervention on
interest rates and re-spark demand-side price pressures. The outcome of
the US presidential elections in November creates additional uncertainty
for the country's economic outlook, depending on the policy choices of
the next government.62 Debt distress Higher interest rates amid slowing
growth will strain debt loads for the public and private sector alike.
The corporate debt default rate remains far lower than peaks hit during
the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (Figure 1.19).63 The majority of
corporate debt is also years from maturity. Less than 14% of S&P 500
debt is set to mature in the next two years, with nearly half to mature
after 2030.64 In essence, the world's largest companies will be
effectively insulated from higher interest rates for more than half a
decade. However, small and medium-sized companies, that form the
backbone of many domestic markets, will be particularly sensitive to
slowing economic growth and persistently high interest rates. As
struggling companies cut costs, unemployment may rise, reducing consumer
spending and creating a negative feedback loop that can contribute to a
deeper economic downturn. This could also contribute to heightened
market concentration, as start-ups struggle and larger, more financially
robust corporations consolidate their position, including in the tech
sector (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). Heavily indebted countries are also
exposed to these economic conditions. The risk of sovereign debt
defaults is rising but notably, even with a strong US dollar, larger
emerging economies such as Mexico and Brazil have largely avoided debt
distress to date.65 This has been attributed to structurally different
conditions in these markets than in the past, including central bank
independence and the accumulation of large foreign-exchange reserves.66
In other parts of the world, like in Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon,
Pakistan, and Tunisia, the risks are much higher. The impacts of tighter
financial conditions will build over time, and pressures on fiscal
balances will rise. Given historically high debt loads, many governments
might be unable or unwilling to help cushion economic impacts to the
same degree as they have in recent years, sharpening the slowdown for
companies and individuals. \[Figure omitted\] Looking ahead These
[results point to a]{.underline} **[global risks
landscape]{.underline}** [where]{.underline} **[economic]{.underline}**,
geopolitical and societal **[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [will
continue to build]{.underline}. Worrying [developments]{.underline}
emerging today [have the]{.underline} **[potential]{.underline}** [to
become chronic global risks]{.underline} over the next decade. As
constant upheaval becomes the norm, decades of investment in human
**[development]{.underline}** -- [and]{.underline} human
**[resilience]{.underline}** -- [are slowly being chipped
away]{.underline}, potentially [leaving]{.underline} even comparatively
strong [states]{.underline} and individuals **[vulnerable]{.underline}**
[to rapid shocks from novel and resurgent sources]{.underline}. The
impacts of extreme weather may deplete available economic resources to
mitigate and adapt to climate change. Increasing vulnerabilities,
brought about by resource stress, conflict and increasing polarization,
could expose societies and whole economies to crime and corruption.
Exponential technology growth may leave the next generation without a
clear path to improve human potential, security and wellbeing.
[How]{.underline} these [global risks]{.underline}
**[evolve]{.underline}** [will reflect the]{.underline} global
**[conditions]{.underline}** [that are]{.underline} slowly [taking
shape]{.underline} across multiple spheres: geostrategic, environmental,
demographic and technological. Chapter 2 discusses a [world]{.underline}
that [is being]{.underline} **[stretched]{.underline}** [beyond its
limit, highlighting]{.underline} a series of **[emergent
risks]{.underline}** [that are arising in the context of]{.underline}
these **[structural]{.underline}** [regime shifts]{.underline}. A
multiplicity of futures are conceivable over the next decade. While the
next chapter explores the most concerning potential outcomes, Chapter 3
explores how a more positive path can be shaped through acting today.
\[Endnotes omitted\] Global Risks 2034: Over the limit This chapter
focuses on the longer-term horizon, highlighting risks that may become
the most severe over the next decade. While the short-term risks
landscape described in Chapter 1 may, if not addressed, contribute to
these negative, longer-term outcomes, attention, planning and action
today can still set us on a markedly more positive trajectory. The world
in 2034 The next decade will usher in a period of significant change,
stretching our adaptive capacity to the limit. GRPS respondents are far
less optimistic about the outlook for the world over the longer term
than the short term. As noted in Chapter 1, nearly two-thirds (63%) of
respondents to the GRPS predict a turbulent or stormy outlook, with
upheavals and an elevated risk of global catastrophes at best (Chapter
1, Figure 1.1). Comparing the two- and 10-year time frames reveals a
deteriorating global risks landscape. Thirty-three of the 34 global
risks increase in severity score over the longer-term, reflecting
respondents' concerns about the heightened frequency or intensity of
these risks over the course of the 10-year horizon (Figure 2.1).
Environmental and technological risks are among those expected to
deteriorate the most in severity over this period and dominate the
longer-term global risks landscape. Nearly all environmental risks are
included in the top 10 rankings for the decade ahead (Figure 2.2).
Extreme weather events are anticipated to become even more severe, as
the top ranked risk over the next decade. Mirroring last year's results,
the perceived severity of Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
worsens the most of all risks, increasing by a full two Likert points,
rising from #20 in the short-term to 3rd place. Critical change to Earth
systems (#2) and Natural resource shortages (#4) are also among those
perceived to materially deteriorate, contributing to their entrance into
the top 10 ranking of risks over the next 10 years, while the related
risk of Involuntary migration rises one place to #7 over the next
decade. Pollution remains in 10th place. In contrast, Non-weather
related natural disasters (#33) falls close to the bottom of rankings
over both time horizons, likely reflecting the nature of such a tail
risk and the often geographically isolated nature of these events.

As we look ahead, one cannot help but wonder if this threat of long-term
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** stagnation and [[**decline**
will]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[be the **catalyst** for **major
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the future. For one, such [economic
[troubles]{.mark} could **[fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline} political
**[[radicalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as]{.mark} it did [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} 1920s and **[[1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At
the same time, [[rising]{.mark} levels of **protectionism** and
**[nationalism]{.mark}** could [lead to]{.mark} far worse [trade
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} than we have seen in recent years,
[something that could]{.underline} also [turn an economic dispute into a
military conflict]{.underline}. Finally, [the [battle for **control**
of]{.mark} **strategic [resources]{.mark}** [such as oil]{.mark}, water,
land [or **rare-earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}
element**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could **intensify**]{.mark}
**as**]{.underline} economic [**growth** slows, resulting in conflicts
over]{.underline} the control of these **[resources]{.underline}**.

[There are many examples of]{.underline} potential [[conflicts]{.mark}
between large]{.underline} economic [powers that [could
**erupt**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the years and decades ahead,
[**particularly** [if]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[**growth**
continues to slow]{.underline}]{.mark} over the longer-term. For
example, tensions between the world's two superpowers, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China**]{.underline}, [have risen]{.underline} steadily in recent
years, due in part to US concerns about China's rising economic and
military power. As [[there are]{.mark} a large number of
[**flashpoints** that could bring]{.mark} these two]{.underline} giant
[[powers into conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
(**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, etc.),
[the likelihood of a superpower conflict is]{.underline} now
[greater]{.underline} than it has been at any time since the early
1980s.

[This is not the only potential great power conflict]{.underline} that
the world faces today. For example, [tensions between [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.mark} have]{.underline} [also been rising]{.underline} as
the latter seeks to regain some of the geopolitical importance and
influence that it lost in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet
Union. [The growing rivalry between **[China and India]{.mark}** is
another flashpoint that has the potential to **erupt**]{.underline} into
a conflict between two major economic powers, particularly [in light
of]{.underline} the [numerous border disputes]{.underline} between those
two Asian giants. In fact, [there are a number of]{.underline} potential
[[conflicts]{.mark} involving]{.underline} two or more [major economies
that [could **erupt**]{.mark} in the near-future]{.underline}, [any of
which would]{.underline} not only [be [influenced by **economic

the economies of the combatants, as well as on the global economy as a
whole.

#### It causes [conflicts]{.underline}, [civil wars]{.underline}, and [diversion]{.underline} that go [global]{.underline} -- nothing checks

**Liu 18** -- Dr. Qian, PhD in Economics from Uppsala University, Former
Visiting Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, Managing

York University, Tsinghua University, the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and Fudan University. "The Next Economic Crisis Could Cause A

11-13-2018

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: [[in the **current**]{.mark}
**social, political, and technological [landscape]{.mark}**[, a]{.mark}
prolonged [economic crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising income
inequality, [could]{.mark} well [**escalate** into]{.mark} a **[major
global]{.mark} military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The 20**[08]{.mark}**]{.underline}-09 global financial [crisis
[**almost** bankrupted]{.mark} governments and caused systemic collapse.
Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back from the brink,
using massive]{.underline} monetary [stimulus]{.underline}, including
quantitative easing and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labor markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. And Greece, for example,
has relied on money from international creditors to keep its head
(barely) above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system
or improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilize and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, [the consequences]{.underline} of this mistake
[could extend **far beyond** the economy]{.underline}. According to
Harvard's Benjamin Friedman, [prolonged periods of economic
[distress]{.mark} have been characterized also by public antipathy
toward minority groups or foreign countries -- attitudes that can help
to [fuel **unrest**, **terrorism**, or]{.mark} even
**[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[For example, [during the Great Depression]{.mark}]{.underline}, US
President Herbert [Hoover signed the]{.underline} 1930
[**[Smoot-Hawley]{.mark}** Tariff Act]{.underline}, intended to protect
American workers and farmers from foreign competition. [In the
subsequent five years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. [Within a
decade, **World War II**]{.mark} had begun]{.underline}.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that [high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict]{.underline}.

[According to research]{.underline} by the economist Thomas Piketty, [a
spike in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis]{.underline}. Income inequality then declines for a while, before
rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster. Though causality
has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data points, this
correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with wealth and
income inequality at historically high levels.

[This is **all the [more worrying]{.mark}** [in view of]{.mark} the
**numerous [other factors]{.mark}** [stoking]{.mark} social unrest and
diplomatic [tension,]{.mark} including **[tech]{.mark}nological
[disruption]{.mark}**, a **record-breaking [migration]{.mark} crisis**,
**anxiety over globalization**, **political [polarization]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} **rising [nationalism]{.mark}**[. All]{.mark} are symptoms
of failed policies that could turn out to be **[trigger points]{.mark}**
for a future crisis]{.underline}.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the emotionally appealing
populists to whom they are increasingly giving their support are
offering ill-advised solutions that will only make matters worse. For
example, [despite the world's unprecedented interconnectedness,
**[multilat]{.mark}eralism [is]{.mark} increasingly being
[eschewed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as countries -- most notably, Donald
Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist policies. [Meanwhile,
**[proxy wars]{.mark}** are **[raging]{.mark}** in Syria and
Yemen]{.underline}.

[Against this background, we must take seriously the possibility that
[the next]{.mark} economic [crisis]{.mark} could [lead to a
**large-scale**]{.mark} **military confrontation**]{.underline}. By the
logic of the political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a
scenario could help us avoid it, because it would force us to take
action. In this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the
structural reforms that they have long promised, while replacing
finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global
dialogue. [The alternative may well be **[global
conflagration]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Various [scholars]{.underline} and institutions [regard **global social
instability** as the **greatest threat**]{.underline} facing this
decade. [The catalyst has been postulated to be [a **Second**]{.mark}
**Great [Depression]{.mark}** which, in turn, [will have **profound
implications**]{.mark} for **global security** and national
integrity]{.underline}. This paper, written from a broad systems
perspective, illustrates how [emerging risks are]{.underline} getting
more complex and **[intertwined]{.underline}**; blurring boundaries
between the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and
technological taxonomy used by the World Economic Forum for its annual
global risk forecasts. [**Tight [couplings]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} our [**[global systems]{.mark}**
have]{.underline} also [[enabled risks]{.mark} accrued [in **one area**
to **snowball** into]{.mark} a [**full-blown crisis**
**elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic and its
socioeconomic fallouts exemplify this systemic chain-reaction.
Onceinexorable forces of globalization are rupturing as the current
global system can no longer be sustained due to poor governance and
runaway wealth fractionation. The coronavirus pandemic is also enabling
Big Tech to expropriate the levers of governments and mass
communications worldwide. This paper concludes by highlighting how this
development poses a dilemma for security professionals.

INTRODUCTION

The new decade is witnessing rising volatility across global systems.
Pick any random "system" today and chart out its trajectory: Are our
education systems becoming more robust and affordable? What about food
security? Are our healthcare systems improving? Are our pension systems
sound? Wherever one looks, there are dark clouds gathering on a global
horizon marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity
(VUCA).

But what exactly is a global system? Our planet itself is an autonomous
and selfsustaining mega-system, marked by periodic cycles and elemental
vagaries. Human activities within however are not system isolates as our
[[banking]{.mark}, utility, [farming, **health**]{.mark}care [and
retail]{.mark} sectors etc. [are]{.mark} increasingly
**[entwined]{.mark}**. Risks accrued in **one system** may **cascade**
into an **unforeseen crisis**]{.underline} within and/or without (Choo,
Smith & McCusker, 2007). Scholars call this phenomenon "emergence"; one
where [the behaviour of **intersecting systems** is determined by
**complex** and largely **invisible interactions** at the
**substratum**]{.underline} (Goldstein, 1999; Holland, 1998).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. While experts remain
divided over the source and morphology of the virus, the contagion has
ramified into a global health crisis and supply chain nightmare. It is
also tilting the geopolitical balance. China is the largest exporter of
intermediate products, and had generated nearly 20% of global imports in
2015 alone (Cousin, 2020). The pharmaceutical sector is particularly
vulnerable. Nearly "85% of medicines in the U.S. strategic national
stockpile" sources components from China (Owens, 2020).

An initial run on respiratory masks has now been eclipsed by rowdy
queues at supermarkets and the bankruptcy of small businesses. The
entire global population -- save for major pockets such as Sweden,
Belarus, Taiwan and Japan -- have been subjected to cyclical lockdowns
and quarantines. Never before in history have humans faced such a
systemic, borderless calamity.

COVID-19 represents a classic emergent crisis that necessitates
real-time response and adaptivity in a real-time world, particularly
since the global Just-in-Time (JIT) production and delivery system
serves as both an enabler and vector for transboundary risks. From a
systems thinking perspective, emerging risk management should therefore
address a whole spectrum of activity across the economic, environmental,
geopolitical, societal and technological (EEGST) taxonomy. Every
emerging threat can be slotted into this taxonomy -- a reason why it is
used by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for its annual global risk
exercises (Maavak, 2019a). As traditional forces of globalization
unravel, security professionals should take cognizance of emerging
threats through a systems thinking approach.

METHODOLOGY

An EEGST sectional breakdown was adopted to illustrate a sampling of
extreme risks facing the world for the 2020-2030 decade. The
transcendental quality of emerging risks, as outlined on Figure 1,
below, was primarily informed by the following pillars of systems
thinking (Rickards, 2020):

> • Diminishing diversity (or increasing homogeneity) of actors in the
> global system (Boli & Thomas, 1997; Meyer, 2000; Young et al, 2006);
>
> • Interconnections in the global system (Homer-Dixon et al, 2015; Lee
> & Preston, 2012);
>
> • Interactions of actors, events and components in the global system
> (Buldyrev et al, 2010; Bashan et al, 2013; Homer-Dixon et al, 2015);
> and
>
> • Adaptive qualities in particular systems (Bodin & Norberg, 2005;
> Scheffer et al, 2012) Since scholastic material on this topic remains
> somewhat inchoate, this paper buttresses many of its contentions
> through secondary (i.e. news/institutional) sources.

ECONOMY

According to Professor Stanislaw Drozdz (2018) of the Polish Academy of
Sciences, "[a global financial crash]{.underline} of a previously
unprecedented scale is highly probable" by the mid- 2020s. This [will
lead to a **trickle-down meltdown**, impacting **all areas** of human
activity]{.underline}.

The economist John Mauldin (2018) similarly warns that the "2020s might
be the worst decade in US history" [and]{.underline} may [lead to a
**Second Great Depression**]{.underline}. Other forecasts are equally
alarming. According to the International Institute of Finance, global
debt may have surpassed \$255 trillion by 2020 (IIF, 2019). Yet another
study revealed that global debts and liabilities amounted to a
staggering \$2.5 quadrillion (Ausman, 2018). The reader should note that
these figures were tabulated before the COVID-19 outbreak.

The IMF singles out widening income inequality as the trigger for the
next Great Depression (Georgieva, 2020). The wealthiest 1% now own more
than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people (Coffey et al, 2020) and
this chasm is widening with each passing month. COVID-19 had, in fact,
boosted global billionaire wealth to an unprecedented \$10.2 trillion by
July 2020 (UBS-PWC, 2020). Global GDP, worth \$88 trillion in 2019, may
have contracted by 5.2% in 2020 (World Bank, 2020).

As the Greek historian Plutarch warned in the 1st century AD: "An
imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of
all republics" (Mauldin, 2014). The stability of a society, as Aristotle
argued even earlier, depends on a robust middle element or middle class.
At the rate the global middle class is facing catastrophic debt and
unemployment levels, widespread social disaffection may morph into
outright anarchy (Maavak, 2012; DCDC, 2007).

[[Economic stressors]{.underline}]{.mark}, in transcendent VUCA fashion,
[may]{.underline} also [[induce]{.mark} **radical [geopolitical
realignments]{.mark}**. Bullions now carry more weight than NATO's
**security guarantees** in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}. After Poland
repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia,
Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit.

According to former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, [this **erosion** in
**regional trust** was based on historical precedents]{.underline} -- in
particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):

> "You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich
> Agreement... I guarantee that if something happens, we won't see a
> single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let's do it (repatriation)
> as quickly as possible." (Parenthesis added by author).

President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his
central bank's gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic
headwinds ahead: "We see in which direction the crisis in the world is
moving" (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed, [[with]{.mark} two global
Titanics -- the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark} --
set [on a **collision course**]{.underline} with a
quadrillions-denominated iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on
its tip, [the **seismic [ripples]{.mark}** [will be felt]{.mark}
**far**, **wide** and for a **considerable period**]{.underline}.

A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions
realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in
these Eastern European nations, worth a collective \$1.8 trillion by
purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol
as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a
potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current
global economic system will be weakened by rising nationalism and
autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains ahead. Mauldin (2018)
proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt jubilees to
facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic Forum, on the
other hand, has long proposed a "Great Reset" by 2030; a socialist
utopia where "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy" (WEF, 2016).

In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the current
global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning house
of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession
(Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems
thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and "adaptivity")
form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade.

ENVIRONMENTAL

[What happens to the **environment** when our **economies implode**?
[Think of]{.mark} a [**debt-laden** workforce at]{.mark} sensitive
[**nuclear** and **chemical plants**]{.mark}, along [with a]{.mark}
concomitant [**surge** in]{.mark} **industrial [accidents]{.mark}**?
**Economic stressors**]{.underline}, workforce demoralization and
rampant profiteering -- rather than manmade climate change -- arguably
[pose the **biggest threats** to the environment]{.underline}. In a WEF
report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19
observation:

> The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from
> accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering \$3
> trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world's 3.2 billion
> workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing
> significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary,
> "vulnerable" or unpaid jobs.

Shouldn't this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or
economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems
thinking approach, however, [global risks can no longer be boxed into a
**taxonomical silo**]{.underline}. Frazzled workforces may precipitate
another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or
Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result
of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster
(2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a
long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly
levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left
204 dead; 7,500 injured; US\$15 billion in property damages; and an
estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental
costs have yet to be adequately tabulated.

Environmental disasters are more attributable to Black Swan events,
systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to mundane human
activity.

[Our JIT world aggravates the **cascading potential** of
risks]{.underline} (Korowicz, 2012). [Production and delivery
delays]{.underline}, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, [will eventually
require industrial **overcompensation**]{.underline}. This will further
stress senior executives, workers, machines and a variety of
computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely include
substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering in health
and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation
workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities
across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer
recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy
(Liacko, 2021).

Even in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely
ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative,
its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences
disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a
result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the
"world's most polluted river" began to suffer from dermatitis,
intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic
bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the
Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications.

On an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have
traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime
elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabriabased 'Ndrangheta mafia -- in
collusion with governments in Europe and North America -- began to dump
radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution
and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy
(Knaup, 2008).

The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an
entwined form of economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence.
In a VUCA world, indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph
into a Black Hawk Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are
governed by actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a
system under study -- as outlined in the methodology section.

Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages -- whether by
disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or
terrorist groups -- cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated
societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to
dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. [Interlinked
ecosystems]{.underline}, particularly water resources, [may be
**hijacked**]{.underline} by nationalist sentiments. [The
**environmental fallouts**]{.underline} of critical infrastructure (CI)
breakdowns [loom like a **Sword of Damocles** over this
decade]{.underline}.

GEOPOLITICAL

[The **primary [catalyst]{.mark}** [behind **WWII** was]{.mark} the
**Great [Depression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since [[history]{.mark}
often **[repeats itself]{.mark}**, expect **familiar bogeymen** to
**reappear**]{.underline} [in societies roiling with
**impoverishment**]{.underline} and ideological clefts.
[[Anti-Semitism]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a societal risk on its own --
[[may]{.mark} reach alarming proportions]{.underline} in the West
(Reuters, 2019), [possibly **[forc]{.mark}**ing [Israel]{.mark} to
undertake **[reprisal]{.mark} operations**]{.underline} inside allied
nations. If that happens, [how will **affected nations**
react?]{.underline} Will security resources be reallocated to protect
certain minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are
exposed to restive forces? **[[Balloon effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**
like these [present a classic]{.underline} VUCA
[problematic]{.underline}.

[Contemporary geopolitical risks [include]{.mark} a possible
**[Iran]{.mark}-Israel [war]{.mark}**[; **US-China**]{.mark} **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [over **Taiwan** or]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea; **North [Korean
prolif]{.mark}eration** of **nuclear** and **missile technologies**; an
**[India-Pak]{.mark}istan [nuclear war]{.mark}**; an **Iranian closure**
of the Straits of **Hormuz**; **fundamentalist-driven implosion in the
Islamic world**; [or]{.mark} a [**nuclear confrontation** between
**NATO** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fears that the Jan 3 2020
assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII
were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of
Soleimani did not fundamentally change the
actor-interconnection-interaction adaptivity equation in the Middle
East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

The second scenario, called Mayhem and Chaos, is the opposite of the
first scenario; everything that can go wrong does go wrong. [The world
[economic situation weakens]{.mark} rather than

suffer]{.mark} a major [reduction in]{.mark} their [growth]{.mark}
rates]{.underline}, further [weakening the global economy]{.underline}.
As a result, [energy demand falls and the price of fossil fuels
plummets, leading to a financial crisis for the energy-producing states,
which are forced to cut back dramatically on expansion programs and
social welfare. That]{.underline} in turn [leads to **[political

[to **Colombia** to **Haiti**]{.mark}, often [**violent protests** are
**sweeping**]{.mark} **every corner of [the globe]{.mark}** as angry
citizens are taking to the streets]{.underline}.

[Each country has different histories and realities]{.underline} on the
ground, particularly in Haiti, where years of violence and government
corruption culminated two weeks ago in the assassination of President
Jovenel Moïse. [But they all faced [a **perfect storm**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} preexisting social,
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and political [[**hardships**,
which]{.mark} fallout from]{.underline} the
**[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic [only **[inflamed]{.mark}
further**]{.underline}. And [they [are]{.mark} merely a
**[foreshadowing]{.mark}** of the **post-coronavirus [global
tinderbox]{.mark}** that's [**looming** as]{.mark} **existing
[tensions]{.mark}** in countries across the world [**morph** into
**broader**]{.mark} **civil unrest and [uprisings]{.mark}** against
**economic hardships** and inequality **deepen**ed by the
pandemic]{.underline}.

The coronavirus pandemic was a once-in-a-century crisis that not only
shocked countries' existing health systems but also demanded a response
that impacted---and was itself shaped by---economic, political, and
security considerations. [The efforts to contain]{.underline} it may
have curbed fatalities in the short term but have inadvertently
[deepened vulnerabilities that laid the groundwork for]{.underline}
longer-term violence, [**conflict**, and **political
upheaval**]{.underline} and should serve as a danger sign to world
leaders as countries reopen---including in the United States.

[**History** is **full of examples** of pandemics being **incubators of
social unrest**]{.underline}, from the Black Death to the Spanish flu to
the great cholera outbreak in Paris, immortalized in Victor Hugo's Les
Miserables. Underlying it all this time around is a pervasive
inequality. COVID-19 has ripped open economic divides and made life
harder for already vulnerable groups, including women and girls and
minority communities.

It has also exposed weaknesses in food security and dramatically
increased the number of people affected by chronic hunger. The United
Nations estimates around one-tenth of the global population---between
720 million people and 811 million---were undernourished last year. The
impacts of climate change and environmental degradation have only
compounded the despair.

[[Take]{.mark} the [**Sahel**, where]{.mark}]{.underline}, due to [[a
**toxic cocktail**]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}, COVID-19 lockdowns,
and climate change, the scale and severity of food insecurity
[[continues to **rise**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Countries such as Ethiopia
and Sudan are among the world's worst humanitarian crises, with
catastrophic levels of hunger. Droughts and locusts are coming at a
critical time for farmers ready to plant crops and are stopping herders
in their tracks from driving their livestock to greener pastures.

The global vaccine shortage is fueling the instability. A majority of
Africa is lagging far behind the world in vaccinations, meaning COVID-19
will continue to constrain national economies and, in turn, become a
source of potential political instability. [The [same]{.mark} is true
[for]{.mark} much of [**Latin America** and
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where countries don't have enough
vaccines to protect their populations and simmering [sources of
[protest]{.mark}---such as rising **living costs**]{.underline} and
deepening inequalities---[[are]{.mark} more [likely to **boil
over**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The global risk firm Verisk Maplecroft has warned that [as many as [**37
countries** could face large]{.mark} protest
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} for up to three years. A new study by
Mercy Corps examining the intersection of COVID-19 and conflict found
concerning trends that warn of potential for new conflict, deepening
existing conflict, and worsening insecurity and instability shaped by
the pandemic response.

The group found a collapse of public confidence in governments and
institutions was a key driver of instability. People in fragile states,
already suffering from diminished trust in their government, have felt
further abandoned as they face disruptions in public services, rising
food prices, and massive economic hardships, such as unemployment and
reduced wages. Supply chains disrupted during the pandemic have seen
food prices skyrocket, while in the global recession humanitarian aid
budgets are being slashed, bringing many countries to the brink of
famine. For the first time in 22 years, extreme poverty---people living
on less than \$1.90 a day---was on the rise last year. Oxfam
International estimates that "it could take more than a decade for the
world's poorest to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic."

The [[shocks]{.mark} caused by the pandemic]{.underline} have also
[**[erode]{.mark}**d **social [cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, further
fraying relations between communities and deepening polarization. That
is especially true in the United States, where social and political
pressures both deepened the health crisis and were themselves worsened
by it. All of this should serve as a clarion call to
[countries]{.underline} that they can't prepare for, or respond to,
future health crises in a vacuum---but must [anticipate an
**economic**]{.underline}, political, and **[social
crisis]{.underline}**. This is true for [[any **severe
shock**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[brings]{.mark} the [potential for
a **breakdown in**]{.mark} **public [order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Abstract

[**[Diversionary War]{.mark}** Theory (DWT) posits that leaders engulfed
in a domestic crisis will attempt to divert the attention of citizens by
initiating an armed conflict against an external actor]{.underline}.
War, under this logic, is a mechanism designed to distract, boost the
leader's popularity, or relegate the responsibility for the crisis to an
outside scapegoat. In this article, I apply [a discursive variation of
DWT]{.underline} to [[account for]{.underline}]{.mark} and describe [the
shift in Donald [**Trump**'s approach to China during]{.mark} the
**[COVID]{.mark}**-19 crisis]{.underline}. This analysis concludes [the
domestic political and [economic difficulties]{.mark} Trump was
grappling with during the 2020 presidential election [motivated him to
blame]{.mark} the Chinese government for the detrimental effects the
pandemic had on the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Trump's
strategic use of novel social media platforms was instrumental in his
campaign to name, shame, and scapegoat [China to divert]{.mark}
attention from the domestic crisis as well as to boost his
popularity]{.underline}.

1 Introduction

What would embattled leaders do when diversionary war is needed to
distract the general public but military conflict is not a feasible
option? In this article, I advance the proposition that "naming and
shaming" is a policy not only used to entice greater compliance with
international human rights norms and laws by exposing countries or
individuals that violate them. Used jointly with scapegoating, a naming
and shaming strategy is a diversionary approach designed to draw the
attention of domestic audiences away from troublesome internal
circumstances, bolster the image of leaders in the eyes of their allies
as well as political base, and pin the blame for such woes on another
actor. Unlike traditional diversionary wars, where leaders initiate
militarily, politically, and economically costly armed conflicts, a
diversionary war of words that utilizes naming, shaming, and
scapegoating is a nonviolent, low-cost, low-risk, and limited-scope
policy designed to help embattled leaders overcome detrimental internal
circumstances that are perceived to pose a threat to their political
rule.Footnote1

[This **discursive strategy** is especially pertinent in the digital age
of social media and advanced communication technologies which enable
unconventional yet direct and unfiltered interaction between leaders
that countless people are exposed to through platforms such as Facebook
or Twitter]{.underline}. Furthermore, an improved understanding of
diversionary wars of words is valuable, because [**severe [rhetorical
skirmishes, even if exclusively]{.mark} taking place [online]{.mark}**,
may **[deliberately or inadvertently]{.mark}** escalate preexisting
tensions, [**spiral out of control** and **lead to**]{.mark} **overt
[armed conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote2 As Chad Freeman (1997,
39) noted, "when states or organizations indulge in rhetoric or behavior
that is offensive to other states, they may expect retribution." [A
rhetorical spat does **not necessarily** constitute the **root cause**
of armed conflict in and of itself, **yet** it can certainly
**[accentuate preexisting tensions]{.mark}**, [**trigger new hostility**
and **escalate**]{.mark} into overt armed conflict]{.underline}. For
example, after North Korea threatened it would consider preemptive
nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States (US) in early
2016, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that Pyongyang's bellicose
rhetoric might "create international legal grounds for using military
force against itself in accordance with the right of a state to
self-defense enshrined in the United Nations Charter" (O'Carroll 2016).

#### Trump is [uniquely prone]{.underline} to lash-out

**Street 16** \[Tim Street, Senior Programme Officer on the Sustainable
Security programme at Oxford Research Group, "President Trump: Successor
to the Nuclear Throne," ORG Briefing, November 2016,
https://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/resources/docs/ORG-President%20Trump-Successor%20to%20the%20Nuclear%20Throne.pdf\]

Donald Trump's arrival in the White House as US President has deeply
unnerved people from across the political spectrum, both inside the US
and around the world. The fact that many regard Trump as an indecent
individual and his government as potentially the number one threat to
their dignity, liberty and life means that the civil strife already
raging in the US is unlikely to fade away soon. The wide-ranging
implications of Trump's election to the most powerful office on
Earth---for the peace and stability of both that nation and the
world---cannot be emphasised enough. In this regard, [[of]{.mark} the
many uncertainties and [worries brought on by]{.mark} a [Trump]{.mark}
presidency, the]{.underline} two [**[existential]{.mark}**
question]{.underline}s [of]{.underline} climate change and [[**nuclear
war** stand out]{.underline}]{.mark}.

With the former, Trump's recent comment that he now has an 'open mind'
about the importance of the Paris climate agreement---having previously
said climate change is a 'hoax'---is unlikely to assuage fears that he
will seek to dramatically expand the US's extraction and reliance on
fossil fuels. With the latter, [strong doubts have been raised over
whether the new President is capable of responsibly handling the
incredible power that will be at his fingertips]{.underline}. Moreover,
several commentators are already raising concerns that a Trump
administration will pursue policies that will aggravate and disappoint
his supporters, [a situation that [could **increase the possibility**
of]{.mark} the US engaging in [a **'diversionary'

In order to consider what we can expect from a Trump presidency, as well
as noting whom Trump empowers as members of his cabinet and those whom
he draws on for advice, it is vital to study the track record of recent
administrations and appreciate the powers Trump will inherit. In doing
so this briefing focuses on the question of what a Trump presidency
might mean for international relations with a focus on nuclear arms,
including doctrine and disarmament. This means reviewing policies
relevant to the US's nuclear arsenal and pressing international
challenges such as non-proliferation, including in East Asia and the
Middle East, as well as the US's relationship with Russia and its role
in NATO.

The power and responsibilities of the nuclear monarch

Since the dawn of the nuclear age, [all US Presidents have been solely
responsible for the decision to use the near-unimaginably destructive
power of the nation's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. Thus, as Bruce
Blair---a former intercontinental ballistic missile launch control
officer--- makes clear, '[Trump will [have]{.mark} the [**sole
authority** to launch]{.mark} nuclear weapons whenever he chooses with a
single phone call]{.underline}.' The wider political meaning of the bomb
for the world is aptly summarised by Daniel Deudney, who describes
nuclear weapons as 'intrinsically despotic' so that they have created
'nuclear monarchies' in all nuclear-armed states. Deudney identifies
three related reasons for this development: 'the speed of nuclear use
decisions; the concentration of nuclear use decision into the hands of
one individual; and the lack of accountability stemming from the
inability of affected groups to have their interests represented at the
moment of nuclear use'.

Similarly, Elaine Scarry has explained in stark terms in her 2014 book
Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing between Democracy and Doom, how the
possession of nuclear weapons has converted the US government into 'a
monarchic form of rule that places all defense in the executive branch
of government' leaving the population 'incapacitated'. In response to
this situation, Scarry argues that the American people must use the
Constitution as a tool to dismantle the US nuclear weapons system,
thereby revitalising democratic participation and control over
decision-making. Scarry also outlines the incredible might the president
wields, with each of the US's fourteen nuclear-armed submarines alone
carrying 'enough power to destroy the people of an entire continent',
equivalent to 'eight times the full-blast power expended by Allied and
Axis countries in World War II'. [Nuclear specialist Hans Kristensen has
described how [the US]{.mark}'s strategic nuclear [war plan 'if
unleashed]{.mark} in its full capacity' could 'kill hundreds of millions
of people, devastate entire nations, and **[cause climatic effects on a
global scale]{.mark}**']{.underline}.

This war plan consists of a 'family of plans' that is aimed at 'six
potential adversaries' whose identities are kept secret. Kristensen
understands that they include 'potentially hostile countries with
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons (WMD)', meaning China, North
Korea, Iran, Russia and Syria as well as a terrorist group backed by a
state that has conducted a catastrophic WMD attack. The 'dominant
mission' for US nuclear weapons within these plans is termed
counterforce, meaning strikes on 'military, mostly nuclear, targets and
the enemy's leadership'.

Despite these plans, the US's nuclear arsenal is often described by
mainstream commentators as being solely intended to ensure mutual
assured destruction (MAD), i.e. as part of the 'balance of terror' with
Russia, in order to prevent armed conflict between the two nations and
to ensure a response in kind to a surprise nuclear attack. However, [as
Joseph Gerson and John Feffer explain, [rather than **deterrence** just
being about]{.mark} enough nuclear forces surviving a surprise first
strike attack to ensure **[MAD]{.mark}**, US [military planners]{.mark}
have [also]{.mark} understood it to [mean 'preventing]{.mark} other
[nations from taking "courses of action]{.mark}" that are [inimical to
US interests]{.mark}']{.underline}.

David McDonough thus describes the 'long-standing goal of American
nuclear warplanners' as being the achievement of the ability to launch a
disarming first-strike against an opponent- otherwise known as nuclear
superiority. This has been magnified in recent years as the US seeks to
'prevent' or 'rollback' the ability of weaker states---both nuclear and
non-nuclear powers---to establish or maintain a deterrence relationship.
Taking all this into account, the new commander-in-chief's apparently
volatile temperament thus raises deep concerns since his finger will be
on the nuclear trigger as soon as he assumes office on 20th January
2017. Given his past experience, Bruce Blair's statement that he is
'scared to death' by the idea of a Trump presidency is but one further
reason why urgent discussion and action, both in the US and globally, on
lessening nuclear dangers---and reviving disarmament---is vital. A
recent report by the Ploughshares Fund on how the US can reduce its
nuclear spending, reform its nuclear posture and restrain its nuclear
war plans should thus be required reading in Washington.

However, as the Economist has rightly noted, 'It is not Mr Trump's fault
that the system, in which the vulnerable land-based missile force is
kept on hair-trigger alert, is widely held to be inherently dangerous'
since, as they point out, 'no former president, including Barack Obama,
has done anything to change it.' Over sixty years after the nuclear
attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclearism thus remains very much
embedded in the nation's strategic thinking. Yet the election of Obama,
and the rhetoric of his 2009 Prague speech, in which he stated
'America\'s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without
nuclear weapons' led many to think that a real change was on the cards.

Obama's visit to Hiroshima earlier this year to commemorate the bombings
was thus a painful reminder of how wide the gap is between the
rearmament programmes that the US and other nuclear weapon states are
engaged in and the disarmament action that they are legally obliged to
pursue under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Obama himself
said in Japan that, 'technological progress without an equivalent
progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution
that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as
well.' For this statement to be meaningful it is necessary to identify
who is responsible for the existing, highly dangerous state of affairs.
In short, the US government's recent record supports Scarry's suggestion
that a democratic revolution is what, in reality, is most needed if the
US is to make substantial progress on nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament. Short-term reforms towards the democratic control and
ultimate dismantlement of the US's nuclear arsenal have been outlined by
Kennette Benedict, who writes that the next administration should:

> place our nuclear weapons on a much lower level of launch readiness,
> release to the public more information about the nuclear weapons in
> our own arsenals, include legislators and outside experts in its
> nuclear posture review and recognize Congress' authority to declare
> war as a prerequisite to any use of nuclear weapons.

Assessing Obama's nuclear legacy

In order to properly appreciate what a Trump presidency may bring, we
need to revisit the range and types of powers bequeathed to the
commander-in-chief by previous administrations. Despite the military
advances made by China and Russia in recent years, it is important to
recognise that the US remains far and away the biggest global spender on
conventional and nuclear weapons and plans to consolidate this position
by maintaining significant technological superiority over its
adversaries, which will, as is well appreciated, push Beijing,
Moscow---and thus other regional powers---to respond. Yet spending on
nuclear weapons alone is set to pose significant budgeting difficulties
for future US governments.

According to a 2014 report by the James Martin Center, the Departments
of Defense and Energy plan to spend approximately \$1 trillion over the
next 30 years 'to maintain its current nuclear arsenal and procure a new
generation of nuclear-armed or nuclear capable bombers and submarines'
as well as new submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and
inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Arms Control Today has
found that total Defense Department nuclear spending 'is projected to
average more than \$40 billion in constant fiscal year 2016 dollars
between 2025 and 2035, when modernization costs are expected to peak'.
Including costs for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security
Administration's projected weapons-related spending during this period
'would push average spending during this period to more than \$50
billion per year'. If anywhere near these sums are spent, then the
modest reductions to the US's nuclear stockpile achieved during the
Obama presidency will be entirely overshadowed. Moreover, as analyst
Andrew Lichterman notes, the US's continued modernisation of its nuclear
forces is 'inherently incompatible' with the 'unequivocal undertaking'
given at the 2000 NPT Review Conference to eliminate its nuclear arsenal
and apply the 'principle of irreversibility' to this and related
actions.

For Lichterman, the huge outlays committed to the nuclear weapons
complex were part of a political 'bargain' made by the Obama
administration with Republicans. This ensured that the New START nuclear
arms control treaty would pass in the Senate whilst also not disturbing
the development of missile defense and other advanced conventional
weapons programmes. New START is a bilateral agreement between Russia
and the US, which Steven Pifer describes as 'one of the few bright
spots' that exists in these nations' relationship. Under the treaty
Moscow and Washington must, by 2018, reduce their stockpile of
operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. Furthermore,
both must keep to a limit of 700 deployed strategic launchers (missiles)
and heavy bombers, and to a combined limit of 800 deployed and
non-deployed strategic launchers and heavy bombers.

Despite New START 'proceeding smoothly' according to Pifer, Hans
Kristensen recently produced a report comparing Obama's record with that
of the previous presidents holding office during the nuclear age, which
found that, hitherto, Obama has cut fewer warheads---in terms of numbers
rather than percentages---than 'any administration ever' and that 'the
biggest nuclear disarmers' in recent decades have been Republicans, not
Democrats. Kristensen thus drily observes of this situation that,

> a conservative Congress does not complain when Republican presidents
> reduce the stockpile, only when Democratic president try to do so. As
> a result of the opposition, the United States is now stuck with a
> larger and more expensive nuclear arsenal than had Congress agreed to
> significant reductions.

As his presidency draws to a close, presumably as a means of securing
some sort of meaningful legacy in this area, it has been reported that
Obama considered adopting a no first use (NFU) policy for nuclear
weapons, something which, whilst reversible, could act as a restraint on
future presidents. Yet this was apparently abandoned, according to the
New York Times, after 'top national security advisers argued that it
could undermine allies and embolden Russia and China'. Furthermore,
according to Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, the governments of
Japan, South Korea, France and Britain all privately communicated their
concerns about Washington adopting NFU. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter
is also said to have argued that such a move would be unwise because 'if
North Korea used biological weapons against the South the United States
might need the option of threatening a nuclear response'.

However, as Daryll Kimball explains, the US's 'overwhelming'
conventional military advantage means that 'there is no plausible
circumstance that could justify---legally, morally, or militarily---the
use of nuclear weapons to deal with a non-nuclear threat'. Such
resistance to NFU is thus deeply disappointing given that, as Kimball
goes on to note, this move would go some way to reassuring China and
Russia about the US's strategic intentions. It would also be an
important confidence-building measure for the wider community of
non-nuclear weapon states, showing that the US is willing to act in
\'good faith\' towards its disarmament obligations under the NPT.

Thinking about the causes of proliferation more widely requires us to
understand what drives weaker states to seek deterrents, if their
reliance on them is to be reduced. For example, as Dr Alan J. Kuperman
observes, NATO's bombing and overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
in 2011 'greatly complicated the task of persuading other states such as
Iran and North Korea 'to halt or reverse their nuclear programs'. The
lesson Tehran and Pyongyang took is thus that because Gaddafi had
voluntarily ended his nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, the West
now felt free to pursue regime change. When assessing the importance of
the Iran nuclear deal, which is often hailed as one of Obama's landmark
achievements, and which the next President must not be allowed to
derail, it is thus important also to consider carefully what behaviour
by the most powerful states will enable existing or potential nuclear
possessors to embrace disarmament and reduce their interest in seeking
non-conventional deterrents.

The inability of Washington to make substantial progress towards
reducing the salience of nuclear weapons at home and abroad is all the
more noteworthy when one considers the state of US and Russian public
opinion on nuclear arms control and disarmament. As John Steinbrunner
and Nancy Gallagher observe, 'responses to detailed questions reveal a
striking disparity between what U.S. and Russian leaders are doing and
what their publics desire'. For example, their polling found that:

> At the most fundamental level, the vast majority of Americans and
> Russians think that nuclear weapons have a very limited role in
> current security circumstances and believe that their only legitimate
> purpose is to deter nuclear attack. It is highly consistent, then,
> that the publics in both countries would favor eliminating all nuclear
> weapons if this action could be taken under effective international
> verification.

Another important measure which the US has failed to hitherto ratify is
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is despite President
Obama stating in 2009 that he intended to pursue Senate ratification of
the treaty 'immediately and aggressively'. Once more, there is notably
strong public support--82% according to a 2010 poll by the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs---for the US joining the CTBT but, again, the
Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the treaty at every
opportunity.

Overall, the gap between the public's will and the government's inaction
on nuclear issues is alarming and redolent of the wider democratic
deficit in the US. On a more positive note, the fact that the citizenry
supports such measures suggests that groups advocating arms control and
disarmament initiatives should continue to engage with and understand
the public's positions in order to effectively harness their support.

Stepping back from the brink

In terms of priorities for the incoming administration in the US,
stepping back from military confrontation with Russia and pushing the
threat of nuclear war to the margins must be at the top of the list.
Whilst much has been made of a potential rapprochement between Trump and
Putin, the two have, reportedly, only just spoken for the first time on
the phone and still need to actually meet in person to discuss strategic
issues and deal with inevitable international events and crises,
including in relation to Ukraine and Syria. As of now, whilst the mood
music from both sides might suggest a warming of relations, as has been
seen with previous administrations, unless cooperation is rooted in a
real willingness to resolve problems (which for Russia includes US
ballistic missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe and NATO
expansion) then tensions can quickly re- emerge. Another related
question concerns how Trump will conduct himself during any potential
crisis or conflict with Russia or another major power, given the stakes
and risks involved, as highlighted above.

Whilst we must wait to find out precisely what the new administration's
approach to international affairs will be, in the past week, NATO's
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that he had been
personally informed by Donald Trump, following the election, that the US
remains 'strongly committed to NATO, and that the security guarantees to
Europe stand'. Trump had previously shaken sections of the defence and
foreign policy establishment by suggesting that NATO was 'obsolete' and
that countries such as Japan (and by extension others such as South
Korea and Saudi Arabia) 'have to pay us or we have to let them protect
themselves', which could include them acquiring the bomb. One reason why
some in Washington have, in the past, not wanted their regional allies
to develop their own nuclear weapons is because the US might then become
dragged into an escalating conflict. Moreover, if an ally in one region
seeks the bomb, this may cause others elsewhere to pursue their own
capabilities- an act of strategic independence that might make these
states harder to influence and control.

The US's key relationships in East Asia and the Middle East illustrate
why, if a future US President wishes to take meaningful moves towards a
world free of nuclear weapons, then developing alternative regional
political agreements, including strategic cooperation with China and
Russia, will be necessary. As Nancy Gallagher rightly notes, the
'weaknesses of existing international organizations' thus requires 'more
inclusive, cooperative security institutions' to be constructed
regionally 'to complement and someday, perhaps, to replace exclusive
military alliances', alongside progressive demilitarisation. Such
confidence-building measures would also support efforts to halt missile
and nuclear tests by states such as North Korea, which may soon be
capable of striking the US mainland.

Imagining the next enemy

As well as mapping out the US's current nuclear weapons policies and its
regional relationships, it is important to reflect upon how domestic
political dynamics under a Trump presidency might drive Washington's
behaviour internationally, particularly given the nuclear shadow that
always hangs over conflicts involving the US.

For example, in the near-term, Trump's economic plan and the great
expectations amongst the American working class that have been
generated, may have particularly dangerous consequences if, as seems
likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very wealthy. Reviewing
Trump's economic plans, Martin Wolf of the Financial Times concludes
that 'the longer-term consequences are likely to be grim, not least for
his angry, but fooled, supporters. Next time, they might be even
angrier. Where that might lead is terrifying'. Gillian Tett has also
highlighted the 'real risks' that Trump's policies could 'spark US
social unrest or geopolitical uncertainty'. Elsewhere, George Monbiot in
the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that the inability of the US and
other governments to respond effectively to public anger means he now
believes that 'we will see war between the major powers within my
lifetime'.

If these warnings weren't troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry
Kissinger argued on BBC's Newsnight that 'the more likely reaction' to a
Trump presidency from terror groups 'will be to do something that evokes
a reaction' from Washington in order to 'widen the split' between it and
Europe and damage the US's image around the world. Given that Trump has
already vowed to 'bomb the shit out of ISIS' and refused to rule out the
use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that
such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided
so that the US does not play into the terrorists' hands.

Looking more widely, President-elect Trump's existing and potential
cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as
'empowering...by and large...the traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing
members of the Republican Party' also point to the US engaging in future
overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism which many in the
foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for proposing during the
presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn
attention to the fact that defence spending under Trump could be almost
\$1trillion (spread over ten years) more than Obama's most recent budget
request. Such projections, alongside Trump's election rhetoric, suggest
that the new nuclear monarch will try to push wide open the door to more
spending on nuclear weapons and missile defense, a situation made
possible, as we have seen, by Obama's inability to implement progressive
change in this area at a time of persistent Republican obstruction.

Conclusion

The problem now, for the US and the world, is that if Trump does make
good on his campaign promises then this will have several damaging
consequences for international peace and security and that if Trump does
not sufficiently satisfy his supporters then this will likely pour fuel
on the flames at home, which may then quickly spread abroad. The people
of the US and the world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a
restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable,
transparent and democratic government. This responsibility will only
grow [**[if crises or shocks take place]{.mark}** in or outside the US

2\. [[Methodological **issues**]{.mark} relating to food **prices** and
political **instability**]{.underline}

Countries that are affected by food shortages tend to be prone to
conflict, violence or instability. Nineteen countries that the Food and
Agricultural Organisation (FAO) classifies as being in a protracted food
crisis are also affected by conflict and violence (Martin-Shields &
Stojets, 2018). Thus, [[scholars have **pondered**]{.mark} about [the
**relationship** between]{.mark} the [**availability** of food and
**probability** of conflict]{.mark}, **especially** after 2008 when the
media reported on many food related **protests** in
low-and-middle-income **countries**]{.underline} (Van Weezel, 2016).
Furthermore, Smith (2014, p. 679) states that "Dramatic weather events,
diversion of crops for fuel production, and continuing volatility in
international grain markets have led many to postulate that urban food
riots will become more frequent, pervasive and disruptive in the
future."

There is a body of literature which argues that grievances (or relative
deprivation) lead to incentives for conflict. Literature in this vein
argues that rising food prices increase the propensity for protests and
food riots. Young men in particular may join rebel groups to gain access
to food (Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011, Raleigh et al., 2015). However,
[[finding]{.mark} the **[ev]{.mark}**idence to **support** these
assertions [is **difficult**]{.mark} [because]{.mark} the
[relationship]{.mark} between food prices (as an indicator of the
**availability** or **accessibility** of food) and **conflict**
[is]{.mark} both [**complex** and **influenced** by]{.mark} many [other
**factors**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith 2014, van Weezel, 2016,
Martin-Shields & Stojets, 2018). Therefore, [[it becomes
difficult]{.mark} [to find]{.mark} evidence of [causal linkages between
**food**]{.mark} prices [and **conflict**]{.mark}. Moreover, the
**[ev]{.mark}**idence [may be **contradictory**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This section explores the [methodological issues]{.underline} that [make
the interaction between food prices and political instability difficult
to **conceptualize** and **assess**.]{.underline}

[[Endogeneity challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It is difficult to **study** the causal link between **food prices**
and **political instability** because they are **endogenous** and there
is **limited ev**idence]{.underline}. According to Martin-Shields &
Stojets (2018) [there are two key sources of endogeneity, which are (1)
[**unobserved confounding factors** and]{.mark} (2) **[reverse
causality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Confounding factors are strongly
correlated with both food insecurity and conflict. For example, [there
is much evidence which **suggests** that national income is negatively
**correlated** with violent conflict and positively correlated with food
security. Likewise, state capacity is also related to violence and food
security]{.underline}. [[Reverse causality occurs when it is
**difficult** to ascertain the]{.mark} [**direction** of]{.mark} the
**[causal links]{.mark}**: does food insecurity exacerbate **conflict**
or does conflict **contribute** to **food insecurity**?]{.underline} (De
Winne & Peersman, 2021; Raleigh et al., 2015). [Some scholars have dealt
with reverse causality by focusing their analysis on international food
prices. They argue that **international food prices** are **unlikely**
to be unaffected by local **conflicts** and as such there is less need
for **concern** about endogeneity]{.underline}. However, it is still
possible that [[global food]{.mark} prices can [be **confounded** by
**variables** such as]{.mark} global [**economic activity** or **oil
prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith, 2014). Some quantitative studies
address endogeneity by including fixed effects or instrumental variables
in models, but De Winne and Peersman (2021) are not convinced that this
approach eliminates endogeneity.

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [**[disruption]{.mark}** to
the agriculture and food supply chains,]{.underline} particularly in the
first half of 2020, most [**sector [shocks]{.mark}** were **[absorbed
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with trade and markets recovering during
the year. Average gross farm receipts for OECD and emerging economies
actually increased in 2020, and the sector was the best performing or
least affected economically in several countries. At the same time,
restricting measures impacted the food security of many low income or
unemployed consumers.

This relative [**economic [resilience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} and food sector [was largely [due

and food as an **[essential]{.mark} sector**]{.underline} and by
ensuring international co-operation to limit trade disruptions.

An estimated 776 unique policy response measures were adopted by
governments of 54 OECD and emerging economies in 2020. These measures
were widely diverse, highlighting the breadth and responsiveness of
public actions to address the impact of the crisis. Close to 20% of the
total were urgent measures, adopted in order to contain the pandemic
while keeping food and agriculture supply chains working. Just under 70%
of measures took the form of temporary relief, seeking to contain the
impact of the crisis on agriculture and food sector actors, and should
be phased out as the crisis recedes. Most of the remaining measures
(10%) were "no regrets" policies with the potential to improve the
long-term resilience of the agro-food sector, and which have the
potential to be scaled up further. At the same time, 11% of measures had
the potential to distort markets or be harmful to the environment.

A first assessment of budgetary expenditures in response to the COVID-19
crisis suggests that a [minimum of USD [157 billion]{.mark} was

and pace of the economic recovery remain uncertain, the
[**fundamentals** of U.S. [ag]{.mark}riculture are [**sufficiently
strong** to **withstand**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The [[sector]{.mark} continues to [chart]{.mark} **productivity
[gains]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and [smart policies, technology, and
innovation are helping farmers deal with]{.underline} the effects of
**[adverse weather]{.underline}** conditions. [Although]{.underline} the
early August derecho in the Midwest, the severe fires in the West, and
the more recent Hurricane [activity]{.underline} in the Gulf have
[caused localized losses, from a **[national]{.mark}** perspective
[weather]{.mark} conditions have **[improved]{.mark}**]{.underline}
relative to 2018 and 2019, [[signaling]{.mark} a more **[bountiful
harvest]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the fall. [**Record levels** of meat
and dairy production are expected]{.underline} in 2020 and 2021.

We know that [U.S. [ag]{.mark}riculture [is]{.mark} **highly
[competitive]{.mark}** in global markets]{.underline}, and the [trade
outlook is looking]{.underline} more [**favorable** with]{.underline}
expected **[global economic recovery]{.underline}** in 2021. Overall,
[agricultural [exports during]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 period appear to have been
**[hold]{.underline}**ing **[up]{.underline}** relatively [well compared
to overall U.S. exports]{.underline}. In the first seven months of 2020,
U.S. ag exports were down 3.5 percent from last year compared to a
decrease of 18 percent for non-ag exports. Just recently we have seen a
major uptick in Chinese purchases. For instance, while U.S. soybean
exports had started off slow this year, since July, China has purchased
14 MMTs. Over the past few months, China has also signaled the intent to
purchase corn at amounts exceeding its 7.2 MMT quota if they all
finalized. [Purchases are [up **across the board**]{.mark}]{.underline},
with total accumulated sales for wheat, sorghum, cotton, pork and beef
**[exceeding]{.underline}** the [pace of 2017 levels
year-to-date]{.underline}.

The [[**limited impact** of]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark} on overall
**ag**]{.underline}ricultural exports [[reflects]{.mark} the fact that
[demand for food]{.mark} is]{.underline} relatively
**[[income-inelastic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that marine
transportation used for most agricultural products (in particular bulk
products) has not been significantly disrupted. [U.S. agricultural
[exports]{.mark}]{.underline} in Fiscal Year 2021 [are projected at
\$140.5 billion]{.underline}, up \$5.5 billion from the FY 2020,
primarily driven by higher exports of soybeans and corn. [Soybean export
volume]{.underline} is forecast to [[rise]{.mark} nearly **[26
percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} year-over-year as growing demand in China
and significantly reduced export volume forecast from Brazil opens the
door for a rise in U.S. exports. [Corn exports]{.underline} are also
[forecast to rise \$700 million to \$**9.0 billion**]{.underline} in
FY2021 [and horticultural exports by \$500 million to \$**35.0
billion**]{.underline} due to expected increase in sales of tree nuts,
among other products. Similarly, [livestock, poultry, and dairy exports
are forecast up \$500 million to \$**32.3 billion**]{.underline}.

Arizona Agriculture: [Geopolitical experts]{.underline} at the New
England Complex Systems Institute [identify]{.underline} a specific
[[food price]{.mark} threshold above which protests become
likely]{.underline} when a population is starving. This [global
[flashpoint may be hard]{.mark} for us [to grasp]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Coming out of the military, what additional insights can you share about
the volatility of a country due to hunger? Dr. Ellis: That's a pretty
**[[well-established linkage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the relationship
[**[between food insecurity and]{.mark} political
[instability]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} can also [turn
violent]{.mark}.]{.underline} To give you an [example, Russia lost about
a third of its wheat harvest in 2011 and banned all wheat exports. The
Middle East and North Africa were hit first and hardest because they
import so much of their wheat from Russia, but also because it caused
food prices to spike and then stay high. When people can't feed their
families, it **[undermines]{.mark} the legitimacy of political
systems**]{.underline}, so you saw all these **[[underlying
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [poverty, corruption, et cetera --
[come to a head]{.mark} with protests and riots]{.underline} that were
really [**[catalyzed by]{.mark}** anger over **[food prices]{.mark}**.
People run out of options]{.underline}, [so it's a catalyst for
political instability and conflict]{.underline}. [[It's]{.mark} also [a
vicious cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[food crises]{.mark} don't just
[drive conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[conflict]{.mark} also
[triggers food crises, which]{.mark}** will in turn, **[deepen conflict
over resources]{.mark}** and worsen the humanitarian impact of
conflict]{.underline}. [[It's]{.mark}]{.underline} what the military
would call [[a]{.mark} **[threat multiplier]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There's actually a famous quote by Alfred Henry Lewis -- "there are only
nine meals between mankind and anarchy." This goes back to what I
pointed out earlier, that [[this]{.mark} particular commodity [is
**existential**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There's nothing people won't do
to ensure they have it]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, we have to think about
it as a question of both [national and global security]{.underline}, we
have to think about building more resiliency into those systems, and we
must think about where our most critical goods are coming from. Arizona
Agriculture: What region of the globe has the most concern for you?
Perhaps another way to say it, what [geopolitical
[flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline} has you waking up at night worried? Dr.
Ellis: All of them right now. This can be a difficult question to answer
because today they [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[interconnected]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first thing that comes to
mind is [the **[Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline} both because of the
conflict between [Israel and Gaza]{.underline} and the **[[potential to
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into a much larger war, but also
because parts of the Middle East and North Africa rank high in food
insecurity]{.underline}. They tend to be very [reliant on wheat
imports]{.underline}, much of which come out of the Black Sea, from
Russia and Ukraine, who are currently at war. So, then you can't really
talk about instability in the Middle East without reference to this
other geopolitical flashpoint because it has an outsized impact on
global food security. And if you're going to talk about the [Russian
invasion of]{.underline} [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, then you must
think about how its [outcome will [affect **China**]{.mark}'s strategic
calculation [in the **S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**ea,]{.underline} and if you're going to talk about that,
then you are also talking about freedom of the seas and [securing global
shipping and trade]{.underline}, which is a primary responsibility of
the [United States Navy]{.underline}. This is a problem because right
now the Navy is also trying to deal with the Houthis disrupting shipping
in the Red Sea, which is causing higher prices and supply chain delays
as ships are forced to bypass the Suez Canal and go all the way around
the southern tip of Africa, which adds significant time and cost and so
now we're back to the Middle East again. So, they [really are all
connected to one another and [any one]{.mark} of them [has]{.mark} the
[potential for cascading]{.mark} effects.]{.underline} Arizona
Agriculture: According to a paper by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), since 1960, global food production
has increased by 390% while land use has increased by a mere 10%. These
are the statistics that can give us hope. What else do you think Arizona
and [**[American ag]{.mark}**riculture]{.underline} do well? Dr. Ellis:
Well, we obviously [[do]{.mark} **[r]{.mark}**esearch a**[n]{.mark}**d
**[d]{.mark}**evelopment really [well]{.mark}]{.underline}, evidenced by
that statistic. We do [[scale]{.mark} really well.]{.underline}
Organizations that accumulate and market for small farmers play a really
important role in scalability in a way that allows smaller family farms
to survive and compete. That part of the system is one that I think
works pretty well for both producers and consumers. As a whole, the
system also does [[efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[well]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} I do think that [[we
should]{.underline}]{.mark} be looking more closely at how we might
[[balance]{.mark} that [with resiliency]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we're
probably overdue for a systemic risk assessment of our food systems at a
national level, especially given the numerous geopolitical and other
risks. The [[just-in-time]{.mark} economic [model]{.mark} that most
sectors]{.underline} of the economy [follow [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a
bit [[risky]{.mark} when]{.underline} you're [talking about your food
supply. [Markets might]{.mark} be really adept at **[adjust]{.mark}**ing
and reallocating, [but **ag**]{.mark}riculture **[is
different]{.mark}**\--]{.underline} [[when]{.mark} fertilizer [supply
chains are disrupted, **you can't simply absorb a**]{.mark} three-week
**[delay]{.mark}** like you can for other goods, [and]{.mark} the
potential **[consequences]{.mark}** of that on a large scale **[are
incomprehensible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I'm also not convinced we do
communication very well. We should be working together between farmers,
the supporting industries, and government to communicate needs and
develop strategies that better support producers and meet national
security priorities. For example, as far as I can tell, industry is
generally unaware of the geostrategic importance of [wheat]{.underline}
and the way it's been used as a tool of U.S. statecraft for over a
hundred years, or the way it [can be used to prevent and ameliorate
conflict]{.underline} so that we can avoid spending a lot more on
military solutions. Since overtaking the U.S. in 2017, Russia is now the
world's largest wheat exporter, which has led to all kinds of
geostrategic problems. Part of the reason the U.S. lags behind in wheat
is because wheat is behind other commodities in research and
development. That's something federal agencies could be supporting. It
could play a role in educating consumers about the benefits of GMOs. It
could be working on coherent trade policy for agriculture that supports
U.S. producers, boosts exports, and ensures we're obtaining necessary
inputs from reliable partners, not from Russia. Our partners overseas
are concerned about this too, but we haven't given them somewhere else
to turn for the world's most important food. If we can address some of
those weaknesses, then I think it would enable us to better capitalize
on our many strengths. Arizona Agriculture: Despite an expertise in this
extremely serious issue, food security, what makes you hopeful? Dr.
Ellis: At the risk of sounding cheesy, it's the ingenuity and spirit of
farmers. They're asked to make an incredible lift -- feed the world and
risk your lives and livelihood in an industry that is completely reliant
on something we can't control, the weather, -- and while you're at it,
solve the water crisis and climate change too, while also being the
first to deal with its impact. They're really the unsung heroes on whose
output we built the modern world. It's why the United States has been so
prosperous, why we can all go to work and do different things and pursue
our interests and make other stuff that makes our lives increasingly
comfortable. It's why the human species has flourished, it's why we've
sustained a population of 8 billion people on the planet, and yet we
just keep asking farmers to do more. And they just keep doing more, they
get up every day and keep innovating and keep problem solving and I
don't think most of the world realizes just how much we rely on them to
do that. So, I think whatever comes next, farmers will solve that too,
because they haven't let us down yet.

[[Humans have **fought over food**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the means
of producing it [for **20,000 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as rock art
in Australia shows]{.underline}. [[Food]{.underline}]{.mark}, water
[[and land scarcity]{.underline} [are **primary drivers**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} two thirds of [[modern
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} today. Indeed, [many people seem to have
forgotten that the primary German war aim in **World War II** was to
take **farmland** from the Soviets and put German farmers on
it.]{.underline} It is very likely that [controlling the Ukraine's
bountiful and reliable food bowl is among **Putin's** main
aims]{.underline} also. In the short run this is imposing hunger and
even starvation on hundreds of millions of people far beyond Europe. 

**[Spreading [hunger]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in turn [**snowballs** into
**government failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[civil
wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[refugee
tsunamis]{.underline}**]{.mark} [around the world]{.underline} -- as it
did in 2008 when a shortfall in Ukrainian grain exports led to
revolutions in three Arab countries. Already, a third of a billion
people -- equal to the entire population of Europe -- leave their homes
each year, either as refugees or economic migrants, to seek better lives
in countries which seem more stable and food secure. War will add to the
flood.

Thus, in developing a new food system for the world of the 21st Century,
we also have to find a way to curb the human appetite for war.

In [Food or
War](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/environmental-policy-economics-and-law/food-or-war?format=PB),
I trace the links between food and conflict through human history,
explore the role of food in recent conflicts and examine [nine [regions
of the world]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[are at **high risk** of **food
failure**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[conflict]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [foreseeable
[future]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [conflicts [ranging from riots]{.mark}
and government failure [to **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. My aim
is to show that [the link between food and war is
**inexorable**]{.underline} -- but that it can be broken. And that
[having enough good food is the most under-rated, under-recognised and
precious 'weapon of peace' in the world today]{.underline}.

## No Grids

### 1NC/2AC\-\--!/D\-\--Grids

#### No [catastrophic]{.underline} cyberattacks.

**Lewis 20** -- James Andrew, senior vice president and director of the
Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe", Center for Strategic &
International Studies,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe, 08-17-2020

A **[[catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark} was]{.underline}** first
**[predicted in the mid-1990s. Since then, predictions]{.underline}** of
a catastrophe **[have appeared regularly]{.underline}** and have entered
the popular consciousness**[.]{.underline}** As a trope, a cyber
catastrophe captures our imagination, but as analysis, **[it
[remains]{.mark} entirely [imaginary]{.mark} and is of dubious value as
a basis for policymaking[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack.

To qualify as **[a [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an event
**[[must produce]{.mark} damaging [mass]{.mark} effect, including
[casualties]{.mark} and destruction[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
**[fires that swept across California]{.underline}** last summer **[were
a catastrophe. Covid]{.underline}**-19 **[has been a
catastrophe]{.underline}**, especially in countries with inadequate
responses**[.]{.underline}** With man-made actions, however, a
catastrophe is harder to produce than it may seem, and **[for
[cyber]{.mark}attacks a [catastrophe requires]{.mark} organizational and
[technical skills]{.mark}]{.underline}** most **[[actors]{.mark} still
[do not possess.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It requires planning,
reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building
attack tools---things that require resources and experience. To achieve
mass effect, either a few central targets (like an electrical grid) need
to be hit or multiple targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is
the case with urban water systems), something that is itself an
operational challenge.

It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to produce it. The 2003 East
Coast blackout is the archetype for an attack on the U.S. electrical
grid. No one died in this blackout, and services were restored in a few
days. As electric production is digitized, vulnerability increases, but
many **[electrical companies have made cybersecurity a
priority.]{.underline}** Similarly, at water treatment plants, the
chemicals used to purify water are controlled in ways that make mass
releases difficult. In any case, it would take a massive amount of
chemicals to poison large rivers or lakes, more than most companies keep
on hand, and any release would quickly be diluted.

More importantly, **[there are powerful strategic constraints on those
who have the ability to launch catastrophe attacks. We
have]{.underline}** more than **[two decades of
experience]{.underline}** with the use of cyber techniques and
operations for coercive and criminal purposes and have a clear
understanding of motives, capabilities, and intentions**[. We can be
guided by the]{.underline}** methods of the **[Strategic Bombing
Survey]{.underline}**, which used **[interviews]{.underline}** and
observation (**[rather than hypotheses]{.underline}**) to determine
effect**[.]{.underline}** These methods apply equally to cyberattacks.
The conclusions we can draw from this are:

Nonstate actors and most states lack the capability to launch attacks
that cause physical damage at any level, much less a catastrophe. There
have been regular predictions every year for over a decade that nonstate
actors will acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two or three
years in what has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary return is
negligible, which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals (mostly Russian
speaking) who might have the necessary skills. One mystery is why these
groups have not been used as mercenaries, and this may reflect either a
degree of control by the Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary
acts) or a degree of caution by criminals.

**[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}** enough
[**[uncertainty]{.underline}** **[among potential attackers
about]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[ability to attribute]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that they are unwilling
to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
response to a catastrophic attack[. (]{.mark}They are perfectly willing
to take the risk of attribution for]{.underline}**
**[espionage]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[coercive cyber
actions.)]{.underline}**

No one has ever died from a cyberattack, and only a handful of these
attacks have produced physical damage. **[A cyberattack is not a nuclear
weapon, and]{.underline}** **[it is intellectually lazy to equate them
to nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** Using a tactical nuclear weapon
against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear war
distorts discussion of cyber warfare.

**[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national
strategies and interests.]{.underline}** **[[Their]{.mark} primary
[emphasis is]{.mark}]{.underline}** on **[[espionage and]{.mark}
political [coercion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and is in conflict with them, but they **[[have no interest in]{.mark}
launching [a catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[since it would]{.mark} certainly [produce]{.mark} an equally
[catastrophic retal]{.mark}iation[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Their goal is
to stay below the "use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, not start a war.

This has implications for the discussion of **[[inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, something that
**[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[never
occurred.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The concern over escalation deserves a
longer discussion, as there are both technological and strategic
constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and the
**[absence of inadvertent escalation [suggests]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}
degree of [control]{.mark} for cyber capabilities [by advanced
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Attackers]{.underline}**]{.mark},
particularly **[among the United States' major opponents]{.underline}**
for whom cyber is just one of the tools for confrontation, **[[seek to
avoid]{.mark} actions that could trigger
[escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The United States has two opponents
(China and Russia) who are capable of damaging cyberattacks. **[Russia
has demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid,
but]{.underline}** neither **[Russia]{.underline}** nor China **[would
be well served by a similar attack on the United States.]{.underline}**
Iran is improving and may reach the point where it could use
cyberattacks to cause major damage, but it would only do so when it has
decided to engage in a major armed conflict with the United States. Iran
might attack targets outside the United States and its allies with less
risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli
critical infrastructure. North Korea has not yet developed this kind of
capability.

One major failing of **[catastrophe [scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** is
that they **[[discount]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[robustness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and resilience **[[of modern
econ]{.mark}omies.]{.underline}** These economies present multiple
targets and configurations; **[they are harder to damage through
cyberattack than they look, [given]{.mark} the growing]{.underline}**
(albeit incomplete) **[[attention to cybersecurity]{.mark}; [and]{.mark}
experience shows that [people]{.mark} compensate for damage and
[quickly]{.mark} repair or [rebuild.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This was one
of the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1

This is a short overview of why catastrophe is unlikely. Several longer
CSIS reports go into the reasons in some detail. Past performance may
not necessarily predict the future, but **[[after 25 years
without]{.mark} a single catastrophic cyberattack]{.underline}**, we
should invoke the concept cautiously, if at all. **[[Why]{.mark} then,
it is [raised so often?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Some of the explanation for the emphasis on cyber catastrophe is
hortatory. When the author of one of **[[the first
reports]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[in the 1990s]{.underline}**) to sound
the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why he had warned of a
cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not going to happen, his
reply was that he **[[hoped to scare people into
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"Catastrophe is nigh; we must act\" was
possibly a reasonable strategy 22 years ago, but no longer.

The resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant
must be taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare,
and this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. **[[The]{.mark} long experience of living under the [shadow
of nuclear annihilation still shapes]{.mark} American [thinking]{.mark}
and conditions the United States [to expect extreme outcomes.]{.mark}
American thinking is [also]{.mark} shaped [by]{.mark} the experience of
[9/11]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fears of another 9/11
reinforce the memory of nuclear war in driving the catastrophe trope,
but when applied to cyberattack, these scenarios do not track with
operational requirements or the nature of opponent strategy and
planning. The contours of cyber warfare are emerging, but they are not
always what we discuss. Better policy will require greater objectivity.

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

[One of the]{.underline} greatest [**reservation**s against
communicating a willingness to take punitive actions concerns the risk
of **escalation** and increased tension due to a more
assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture. Yet when looking into
possible responses -- retaliation [in **cyber**]{.mark}space, for
example -- a number of [**"self-dampening" mechanisms** appear]{.mark}
to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be **applicable** to many types of
responses]{.underline}.30 [One example is the requirement to
establish]{.underline} some level of **[attribution]{.underline}** of
aggression on which to base a response. As discussed above, while
attribution is rarely impossible, [it can be a time-consuming and
technically-challenging endeavor. In a high-stakes scenario [the
**time** taken to get **attribution**]{.mark} **as [right]{.mark} as
possible** [means]{.mark} there will be **[plenty]{.mark} of time** to
**[think twice]{.mark}** about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to
**[lean on diplomatic measures]{.mark} in parallel**. An example of a
self-dampening mechanism related to the **cyber** domain is the [**large
investment** required to develop]{.mark} **credible [offens]{.mark}ive
capabilities**. Moreover, **an [offens]{.mark}ive cyber capability**
[is]{.mark} **a [transitory]{.mark} tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability
to access a computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only
[temporary]{.mark}** [and **depend**]{.mark}**ent** [on]{.mark} a **very
[rapid]{.mark} and ongoing [patching of
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the
cyber instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might
have a de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility
to the opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**self-[limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to
the challenge of **identifying** and **developing targets** of adequate
strategic significance -- **not too much, not too little** -- to achieve
the desired effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying
**["middle range"]{.mark} punitive [actions]{.mark}** that are
**[proportionate]{.mark}** to the aggression threatened or suffered
[will]{.mark} also **self-[limit]{.mark}** the escalatory potential. [It

[spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way
to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight
and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

Limited Costliness of Offensive Cyber Effects

Even under circumstances in which a state may possess the right cyber
response capabilities at the desired time, [its [response may not
generate]{.mark} **[sufficient costs]{.mark}** against the target [to be
**perceived as escalatory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.41 Fundamental limits
on the cost-generation potential of offensive cyber operations stem from
the fact that [cyber capabilities lack the **physical violence** of
conventional and nuclear ones.]{.underline} [Cyber weapons target
**data**; they disrupt, manipulate, degrade, or destroy data resident on
networks and systems or in transit]{.underline}.42 Moreover, [aside from
those cyber capabilities that permanently destroy data and for which
there are no backups to which a target can revert, [cyber effects are
**temporary** and]{.mark} often **[reversible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The utility of military instruments of power for the purposes of
coercion or brute force inheres in their abilities to
inflict]{.underline}---or credibly threaten to inflict---[**significant
damage** and **harm** against a target state]{.underline} (its civilian
population or its military forces) [to achieve a political
objective]{.underline}.43 [Cyber weapons]{.underline} could be (and have
been) used to disrupt an adversary's networks and systems---overwhelming
them such that they temporarily lose the ability to function or the
target loses confidence in their reliability---or [even to produce
destructive effects by destroying data resident on these
systems]{.underline} or, in rarer circumstances, [producing effects in
the physical realm.]{.underline}44 While conducting multiple
cyberattacks against a targeted state's critical national
infrastructure, for example, could in theory generate significant
economic and national security consequences, [the **temporal aspects**
of offensive cyber]{.underline} [operations as described above **limit**
the ability of even the most **capable states** to sustain persistent,
high-cost effects against **multiple strategic targets**]{.underline}
over time. [There is simply **no guarantee** that a state can generate
**significant costs** against a target in th]{.underline}e context of an
[unfolding crisis]{.underline}. This reality starkly contrasts with the
relative predictability and reliability of conventional effects. Indeed,
the empirical record has largely validated this claim; "[[the **vast
majority** of **malicious cyber activity** has taken place far below the
**threshold of armed conflict**]{.mark} between states, and has not
risen to the level that would]{.underline} [trigger such a
conflict]{.underline}."45 This is why, in Lin's parlance, "[going cyber
is **pre-escalatory**" and **[countervalue
cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} (those that target civilian, rather
than military, assets) [[occur "**all the time** now and are at the
**BOTTOM** of the escalation ladder]{.underline}]{.mark}" \[emphasis in
original\].46 Rather than their ability to wreak permanent, destructive
effects, [cyber operations are often prized for their **temporary** and
**reversible nature**]{.underline}.47

[One metric to assess the cost-generation potential of offensive cyber
is in terms of loss of life]{.underline}. By this measure, [cyber
operations are **unlikely** to inflict significant harm]{.underline}.
While theoretically possible that cyber operations could lead directly
to a loss of life, [[no one has reportedly **died to date** as a
direct]{.mark} [**result of a cyberattack** despite over **30 years** of
recorded cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.48 Even in hypothetical
catastrophic scenarios, [the cost in terms of human casualties is
**minimal**.]{.underline} For instance, [common worst-case scenarios of
cyberattacks revolve around the **loss of power** stemming from a
cyberattack]{.underline} on [an **electric grid**]{.underline}.49
However, even in this instance, [the conceivable damage from the loss of
power over an **extended period** is **far less** than that which could
be wreaked using **basic, limited conventional
capabilities**]{.underline}. To draw a comparison, when Hurricane Sandy
hit the United States' eastern seaboard in late October 2012, over 8.5
million people were left without power---with many going weeks and even
months before it was brought back online.50 [Yet a US National Hurricane
Center postmortem of Hurricane Sandy reported]{.underline} that of the
159 people in the United States killed either directly or indirectly,
only "[**about 50 of these deaths** were the result of extended power
outages during **cold weather**, which led to deaths from
**hypothermia**]{.underline}, falls in the dark by senior citizens, [or
**carbon monoxide** poisoning from improperly placed
generators]{.underline} or cooking devices."51 [If a cyberattack took
out power of a similar magnitude and duration of Hurricane Sandy, it is
conceivable that an **equivalent number** of casualties would result.
[The 2015 **synchronized cyberattacks** against **Ukrainian power
companies**]{.mark}, attributed to Russia]{.underline}, was the first
known example of an offensive cyber operation targeting a state's power
grid. [Its cost was ultimately low---service was temporarily [disrupted
to 225,000 customers]{.mark} for several hours, and energy providers
operated at a limited capacity for some time after service]{.underline}
was restored.52 [[There were no **reported
casualties**]{.underline}]{.mark} from this power outage. While any
casualty resulting from a cyberattack would certainly be lamentable[,
even **worst-case scenario** figures are **minor** in comparison to the
cost in **human lives** stemming from other, **even limited**, kinetic
military operations.]{.underline}

across fronts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Economic Collapse]{.underline}: [Multi-front [conflicts]{.mark} would
[disrupt energy, food, and mineral supplies, triggering global
recessions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The interconnected nature of
[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., 40% of global trade through the
South China Sea, 20% of oil via Hormuz) [[amplifies the
impact]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially [[destabilizing fragile states
and fueling proxy wars]{.underline}]{.mark} in Africa or South Asia.

Nuclear Risks: The [[strain]{.mark} of multi-front crises could **[lower
nuclear thresholds]{.mark}**, particularly if Russia or China perceive
existential threats]{.underline}. [**[Miscalculations in the

[Mitigating Factors and Challenges]{.underline}

Allied Coordination: NATO, the Quad, and AUKUS could pool resources to
manage multi-front threats, but [differing priorities]{.underline}
(e.g., Europe's focus on Ukraine vs. Asia's on Taiwan) [complicate
unity.]{.underline} [Arctic cooperation via the Arctic Council is
weakened by Russia's exit.]{.underline}

[Diplomacy:]{.underline} Crisis hotlines (e.g., U.S.-China, U.S.-Russia)
[aim to prevent miscalculation, but distrust limits
effectiveness]{.underline}. [Regional frameworks]{.underline} (e.g.,
ASEAN, African Union) could address resource conflicts but [lack
enforcement power]{.underline}.

Resilience: **[[Diversifying energy]{.mark} (e.g.,

rare earths) [[**reduces dependence on Arctic** or Middle East]{.mark}
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but scaling takes years. Cyber
defenses are improving but lag behind offensive capabilities.

Challenges: [Global powers' [zero-sum mindsets and domestic

economic slowdown) [[hinder de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Climate change]{.mark}, driving Arctic and resource conflicts,
[remains a]{.mark} slow-burning [amplifier]{.mark} with inadequate

In summary, Arctic tensions amplify crises in Ukraine, Taiwan, and the
Middle East by stretching military resources, disrupting economic
stability, and intensifying great power rivalries. Russia's Arctic
militarization could bolster its Ukraine campaign, China's polar
ambitions could align with Taiwan moves, and energy competition could
exacerbate Middle East volatility. [Multi-front

### Yes Grids\-\--AT: No Impact

#### Grid collapse causes nuclear meltdowns and zirconium fires -- extinction -- made worse by cyber vulnerabilities.

**Leyse 24** (Mark Leyse, is a nuclear power safety advocate, focusing
on fuel-cladding issues, severe accidents, and improving evaluations of
postulated accidents. Safety issues he raised in a petition for
rulemaking, PRM-50-84, contributed to a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
rulemaking on fuel-cladding behavior under reactor loss-of-coolant
accident conditions---revisions to Section 50.46(b)---that was approved
in 2012. In 2014, he wrote a report for Natural Resources Defense
Council on unresolved problems associated with severe accident hydrogen
generation. 4-2-2024, \"Spent nuclear fuel mismanagement poses a major
threat to the United States. Here\'s how.\", Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,

-- DOA: 6/8/24, MoState JG

Irradiated fuel assemblies---essentially bundles of fuel rods with
zirconium alloy cladding sheathing uranium dioxide fuel pellets---that
have been removed from a nuclear reactor (spent fuel) generate a great
deal of heat from the radioactive decay of the nuclear fuel's unstable
fission products. This heat source is termed decay heat. Spent fuel is
so thermally hot and radioactive that it must be submerged in
circulating water and cooled in a storage pool (spent fuel pool) for
several years before it can be moved to dry storage.

The [dangers of reactor meltdowns are well known]{.underline}. But
[[spent fuel can]{.mark} also overheat and [burn]{.mark} in a storage
pool [if]{.mark} its [coolant water is lost]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby potentially [releasing large amounts of radioactive material
into the air. This type of accident is [known as a]{.mark} spent fuel
pool fire or **[zirconium fire]{.mark}**]{.underline}, named after the
fuel cladding. [[All]{.mark} commercial nuclear power
[plants]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States---and nearly all in
the world---[[have at least one spent]{.mark} fuel [pool]{.mark} on
site]{.underline}. [A **fire at an overloaded pool** (which exist at
many US nuclear power plants) could release radiation that dwarfs what
the Chernobyl nuclear accident emitted.]{.underline}

Many analysts see very rare, severe earthquakes as the [[greatest
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to spent fuel pools; however, [another far
more [likely]{.mark} event could threaten US nuclear sites: a widespread
**[collapse of the]{.mark} power [grid]{.mark}** system.]{.underline}
[Such a collapse could be triggered by a variety of events, including
solar storms]{.underline}, [physical attacks, and
cyberattacks---]{.underline}all of which are known, documented
possibilities. Safety experts have warned for decades about the dangers
of overloading spent fuel pools, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and Congress have refused to act.

The threat of overloaded spent fuel pools. [Spent fuel
[pools]{.mark}]{.underline} at US nuclear plants [[are]{.mark} almost as
[densely packed]{.mark} with nuclear fuel as operating
reactors]{.underline}---a hazard that has existed for decades and
**[vastly [increases]{.mark} the [odds of]{.mark}]{.underline}** having
**[[a major accident]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Spent fuel assemblies could ignite---starting a zirconium fire---if an
overloaded pool were to lose a sizable portion or all of its coolant
water]{.underline}. In a scenario in which coolant water boils off,
[uncovered zirconium cladding of fuel assemblies may overheat and
chemically react with steam,]{.underline} [generating explosive hydrogen
gas]{.underline}. A [substantial amount of hydrogen would almost
certainly detonate, destroying the building that houses the spent fuel
pool.]{.underline} ([Only a small quantity of energy is required to
ignite hydrogen gas]{.underline}, [including electric sparks from
equipment]{.underline}. It is speculated a ringing telephone initiated a
hydrogen explosion that occurred during the Three Mile Island accident
in 1979.)

[A [zirconium fire]{.mark} in an exposed spent fuel pool
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} have the potential to [[emit **far more
radioactive cesium**]{.mark} 137 **[than]{.mark}** the
**[Chernobyl]{.mark}** accident released]{.underline}. (The US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) has conducted analyses that found a
zirconium fire at a densely packed pool could release as much as 24
megacuries of cesium 137; the Chernobyl accident is estimated to have
released 2.3 megacuries of cesium 137.) Such [a disaster could
contaminate thousands of square miles of land in urban and rural areas,
potentially **[exposing millions]{.mark}** of people **to large doses of
ionizing radiation**, many of whom could die from early or latent
cancer.]{.underline}

In contrast, if a thinly packed pool were deprived of coolant water, its
spent fuel assemblies would likely release about 1 percent of the
radioactive material predicted to be released by a zirconium fire at a
densely packed pool. A thinly packed pool has a much smaller inventory
of radioactive material than a densely packed pool; it also contains
much less zirconium. If such a limited amount of zirconium were to react
with steam, most likely too little hydrogen would be generated to
threaten the integrity of the spent fuel pool building.

After being cooled under water for a minimum of three years, spent fuel
assemblies can be transferred from pools to giant, hermetically sealed
canisters of reinforced steel and concrete that shield plant workers and
the public from ionizing radiation. This liquid-free method of storage,
which cools the spent fuel assemblies by passive air convection, is
called "dry cask storage."

A typical US storage pool for a 1,000-megawatt-electric reactor contains
from 400 to 500 metric tons of spent fuel assemblies. (Dry casks can
store 10 to 15 tons of spent fuel assemblies, so each cask contains a
far lower amount of radioactive material than a storage pool.) Reducing
the total inventories of spent fuel assemblies stored in US spent fuel
pools by roughly 70 to 80 percent reduces their amount of radioactive
cesium by about 50 percent. And the heat load in each pool drops by
about 25 to 30 percent. With low-density storage, a pool's spent fuel
assemblies are separated from each other to an extent that greatly
improves their ability to be cooled by air convection in the event that
the pool loses its coolant water. Moreover, a dry cask storage area,
which has passive cooling, is less vulnerable to either accidents or
sabotage than a spent fuel pool.

In the aftermath of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan,
in which there was a risk of spent fuel assemblies igniting, the NRC
considered forcing US utilities to expedite the transfer of all
sufficiently-cooled spent fuel assemblies stored in overloaded pools to
dry cask storage. The NRC decided against implementing such a safety
measure.

To help justify its decision, the NRC chose to analyze only one scenario
that might lead to a zirconium fire: a severe earthquake. In 2014, the
NRC claimed that a severe earthquake with a magnitude "expected to occur
once in 60,000 years" is the prototypical initiating event that would
lead to a zirconium fire in a boiling water reactor's spent fuel pool.

The NRC's 2014 study concluded that the type of earthquake it selected
for its analyses would cause a zirconium fire and a large radiological
release to occur at a densely packed spent fuel pool once every nine
million years (or even less frequently). Restricting its analyses to a
severe earthquake scenario allowed the NRC to help allay public fears
over the dangers of spent fuel pool accidents. (At the time of the
Fukushima Daiichi accident, the New York Times and other news outlets
warned that a zirconium fire could break out in the plant's Unit 4 spent
fuel pool, causing global public concern.)

[There is good reason to question whether severe earthquakes pose the
greatest threat]{.underline} to spent fuel pools. [A **[widespread
collapse of the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark}** system]{.underline}
that would last for a [period of months]{.underline} to
years---estimated to occur once in a century---[may be **[far more
likely]{.mark} to lead to a zirconium fire** than a severe
earthquake.]{.underline} The prospect that a widespread, long-term
blackout will occur within the next 100 years should prompt US utilities
to expedite the transfer of spent fuel from pools to dry cask storage.
Utilities in other nations, including in Japan, that have overloaded
pools should follow suit.

Solar storms, [physical [attacks]{.mark}, and cyberattacks have the
potential to [cause]{.mark} a nightmare scenario]{.underline} in which
[the US power grid [collapses]{.mark}, along with other vital
infrastructures---[leading to]{.mark} reactor [meltdowns and]{.mark}
spent fuel [pool fires, whose]{.mark} radioactive [emissions]{.mark}
would [aggravate]{.mark} the [disaster.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Vulnerability to solar storms. In 2012, the NRC issued a Federal
Register notice stating that an extreme [[solar
storm]{.underline}]{.mark} (with its accompanying geomagnetic storm at
the Earth[) could [cause]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[failure]{.underline}]{.mark} of hundreds of extra-high voltage
transformers---with a maximum voltage rating of at least 345
kilovolts---[precipitating widespread, long-term blackouts]{.underline}.
The NRC posited that such a solar storm might occur once in 153 years to
once in 500 years and [initiate "a series of events potentially leading
to \[reactor\] core damage at multiple nuclear sites."]{.underline}

The NRC's Federal Register notice announced the agency had determined
that the threat of prolonged power outages leading to at least one spent
fuel pool fire must be addressed in its rulemaking process. The NRC
decided to consider enacting regulations that Thomas Popik of the
Foundation for Resilient Societies, a non-profit organization focusing
on infrastructure reliability, requested in a petition for rulemaking.
Popik asked the NRC to require plant owners to ensure spent fuel pools
would have long-term cooling and a replenished supply of coolant water
in the event that an extreme solar storm collapsed large portions of the
US power grid for a period of months to years. Among other things, Popik
was concerned that emergency diesel generators would not be able to
supply the onsite electricity needed to cool the spent fuel pool for
more than a few days.

Over the past 160 years, the Earth has been hit by two solar
superstorms---the 1859 Carrington Event and the 1921 New York Railroad
Superstorm---that would be powerful enough to disable large portions of
today's global power grids. Scientists estimate that such extreme solar
storms may hit the Earth once in a century, so the odds are that the
Earth will be hit by a solar superstorm at some point during this
century. In July 2012, a solar superstorm, estimated to have been more
intense than the Carrington Event, crossed the Earth's orbit, missing
the Earth by about 11 million miles, or by one week's time.\*

Solar superstorms are caused by coronal mass ejections: Eruptions of
billions of tons of electrically-charged particles spat from the Sun's
corona, which travel at velocities as fast as several million miles per
hour and can reach the Earth within 24 hours. Most coronal mass
ejections, however, miss the Earth because it is a relatively small
point within the solar system.

When a solar superstorm's electrically-charged particles envelop the
Earth, they cause [extreme geomagnetic storms---mostly affecting
high]{.underline} [northern and southern]{.underline}
[latitudes]{.underline}. In a geomagnetic storm, the Earth's geomagnetic
field varies in magnitude, creating electric fields in the ground that
induce electric currents in the power grid. Extreme geomagnetic storms
may induce electric currents strong enough to melt the copper windings
of extra-high voltage transformers, which may become damaged beyond
repair and need to be replaced.

Extra-high voltage transformers are mostly manufactured overseas and
difficult to transport. (Such transformers weigh between 100 and 400
tons.) In the United States, only a small number of facilities build
extra-high voltage transformers. They cost several million dollars to
manufacture and install; each is custom made to fit the specifications
of its substation. Different designs are not typically interchangeable
with one another, and few spares are manufactured. Manufacturing and
installing even one such massive transformer can take over one year.

Solar storms that were far less intense than the New York Railroad
Superstorm have collapsed modern power grids. In the early hours of
March 13, 1989, on a freezing night, a geomagnetic storm caused Canada's
Hydro-Québec grid to collapse within 90 seconds, leaving six million
people without electric power for about 9 hours. (The magnitude of
geomagnetic storms can be measured in nanoteslas per minute, where the
tesla is a unit of magnetic flux density.) The New York Railroad
Superstorm is estimated to have reached a magnitude of approximately
5,000 nanoteslas per minute, and the March 1989 Storm was one-tenth as
intense, reaching approximately 480 nanoteslas per minute. In late
October 2003, geomagnetic storms less intense than the March 1989 Storm
caused a blackout in southern Sweden and permanently damaged 15
extra-high voltage transformers in South Africa by overheating them.

Solar storms can cause large geomagnetic field variations to suddenly
materialize over vast geographic areas, precipitating multiple,
near-simultaneous failures at different locations of the electric power
grid system. Over the past half century, the United States and other
nations have dramatically expanded their power grids---adding more
long-distance transmission lines and high-voltage
infrastructure---thereby increasing their vulnerability to geomagnetic
storms. Moreover, the [[aging]{.mark} of vital]{.underline} power-grid
[infrastructures also [increases]{.mark} the grid's
[vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Vulnerability to physical attacks]{.underline}. On April 16, 2013,
gunmen attacked the Metcalf Transmission Substation in San Jose,
California, rendering it out of service. The gunmen shot 120 rounds from
semiautomatic rifles, hitting 17 extra-high voltage transformers. The
transformers leaked more than 50,000 gallons of cooling oil. They
overheated, without exploding, and shut down. According to Jon
Wellinghoff, a former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the Metcalf attack nearly caused a blackout in Silicon
Valley; one that may have persisted for a period of several weeks.

In response to the assault on Metcalf, its owner---Pacific Gas and
Electric---decided to spend \$100 million over the course of three years
to help fortify its substations. That did not prevent thieves, in August
2014, from cutting through a fence at Metcalf and pilfering construction
equipment that was intended to bolster security. It took utility workers
more than four hours to realize the substation had been burgled.

In January 2022, the Department of Homeland Security warned that
[domestic [terrorists]{.mark} have been [devising]{.mark} credible
[strategies for sabotaging the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark} over the
past few years.]{.underline} Protecting all 55,000 substations that make
up the US grid, however, is a difficult task. In December 2022, at least
one malefactor shot at and severely damaged two substations---owned by
Duke Energy---in North Carolina's Moore County, located about 90 miles
east of Charlotte. Around 45,000 homes and businesses lost electricity
as a result, and tens of thousands of customers got their power restored
only after several days. Commenting on the Moore County attacks,
Wellinghoff observed that "[most \[substations\] don't seem]{.underline}
to be very well [protected]{.underline}. Many of them still have chain
link fences, like the one in North Carolina."

In 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that a US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission analysis had concluded that [[if saboteurs]{.mark}
synchronized physical attacks]{.underline} [and [disabled **as few as
nine**]{.mark} critical power **[substations]{.mark}**, especially on a
hot summer day, **[the entire]{.mark} US [mainland could lose]{.mark}
electric [power for]{.mark} several [months]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, determining or simply procuring information about the
locations of the most critical substations in the continental US is a
relatively easy task.

[[Malefactors can]{.underline}]{.mark} also physically [[attack]{.mark}
substations [remotely]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[drones]{.underline} armed [with improvised explosive
devices]{.underline} could [target US substations in synchronized
swarms,]{.underline} potentially collapsing the power grid. In September
2022, [[Russia attacked]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian [infrastructure in
[Ukraine]{.mark}, including the Ukrainian power
[grid]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} waves of Iranian
Shahed-136, "kamikaze" [[drones]{.underline}]{.mark}. These drones can
carry up to 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of explosives over hundreds of
miles. Kamikaze drones explode on impact. In October 2022, Russian
kamikaze drones partly disrupted the delivery of electricity in the
three major Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Lviv.

[Vulnerability to cyberattacks]{.underline}. In December 2015, [Russian
hackers caused power outages in Ukraine by remotely opening circuit
breakers,]{.underline} thereby [cutting off the flow of electricity, at
dozens of substations.]{.underline} It is the first confirmed instance,
worldwide, that a [[cyberattack]{.mark} caused a
[blackout]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within minutes, the hackers targeted
three energy utilities, causing outages that lasted six hours and
affected nearly a quarter-million people. Fortunately, the Ukrainian
power grid has the odd benefit of being partly antiquated. It is not
completely dependent on computer control systems; that is, industrial
control systems and supervisory control and data acquisition (also known
as "SCADA") systems, which monitor and command an electric grid's
physical equipment. Ukrainian grid operators were able to turn the power
back on by bypassing their compromised control systems and manually
closing circuit breakers at affected substations[. One year later, in
December 2016, another Russian cyberattack would cause a second blackout
in Ukraine.]{.underline}

The 2016 cyberattack was more sophisticated than that of 2015. Power was
restored after one hour; however, the hackers shut down a large Kyiv
substation that handled a greater electric load (200 megawatts) than the
total load handled by the dozens of substations that had been
successfully targeted the previous year. The [hackers [deployed
malware]{.mark}]{.underline}---later named "CrashOverride"---that
analysts have characterized [[as "an automated, grid-killing
weapon]{.mark}."]{.underline}

CrashOverride was designed to communicate with the Ukrainian power
grid's particular computer control systems, enabling it to manipulate
the behavior of physical equipment at substations. At a preset time,
CrashOverride opened circuit breakers at targeted substations to
precipitate the blackout, without requiring oversight from hackers.

[Malware programs]{.underline} like CrashOverride [can]{.underline} also
[be tailored to attack European and North American power
grids.]{.underline} Some analysts have posited that Ukraine is "Russia's
test lab for cyberwar," noting that ["in the cyber world]{.underline},
[[what happens in Kiev]{.mark} almost [never stays]{.mark} in
Kiev]{.underline}." The [[US]{.mark} power [grid is more computerized
and automated]{.mark} than Ukraine's grid, [providing]{.mark} [many
openings]{.mark} for cyber infiltration]{.underline}. The Idaho National
Laboratory (INL) has warned that the
[[interconnectivity]{.underline}]{.mark} of SCADA systems [[exposes
the]{.mark} US power [grid]{.mark} to cyberattacks]{.underline}.

Given enough time, hackers could penetrate US transmission networks and
plant CrashOverride or another tailored malware at any number of desired
locations. CrashOverride can automatically execute the task of scanning
transmission networks and selecting multiple targets, including those
that control automated on-off switches for circuit breakers. Once
entrenched, CrashOverride is set "like a ticking bomb," ready to sow
chaos in power grid systems at any specified time.

Analysts at Dragos and Eset, two cyber-security companies for critical
infrastructure, have pointed out that CrashOverride contains some code
indicating it [has the capacity to disable protective
relays]{.underline}, which protect transmission lines and transformers
against electric surges by opening circuit breakers. If hackers rendered
protective relays inoperable while increasing local electric loads, they
could cause transmission lines to melt and transformers to burn. [Wide
portions of the US grid could become disabled for months to years if
hackers managed to destroy many extra-high voltage
transformers.]{.underline}

In 2016, Idaho National Laboratory analysts came to similar conclusions
as those at Dragos and Eset, warning that [[a major cyberattack]{.mark}
on the US grid]{.underline} could [seriously damage critical
equipment]{.underline}, including extra-high voltage transformers, [and
[lead to cascading blackouts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some substations have
networks that are incapable of detecting hackers' intrusions and planted
malware. INL analysts have cautioned that hackers could exploit such
vulnerabilities to launch a coordinated cyberattack against multiple
substations. Five years later, in June 2021[, US Energy Secretary
Jennifer Granholm acknowledged that hackers have the capability to shut
down the US power grid.]{.underline}

Insufficient public safety. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the US
nuclear industry established the Diverse and Flexible Mitigation
Capability (FLEX) strategy, which is intended to help workers at nuclear
plants manage a severe accident. The FLEX strategy stipulates that plant
sites store portable equipment, such as backup generators and battery
packs that can provide emergency power and pumps that can inject coolant
water into the reactor or spent fuel pool. Such equipment is also stored
at two national response centers, located in Memphis, Tennessee and
Phoenix, Arizona. The response centers must be capable of dispatching
required equipment to any nuclear plant located in the United States
within 24 hours. However, each center only houses five complete sets of
FLEX equipment, not nearly enough equipment to simultaneously service
the entire US nuclear reactor fleet.

[**In a long-term, nationwide blackout, US nuclear power [plants would
lose]{.mark} their supply of [offsite electricity]{.mark}.** Emergency
diesel generators, which provide onsite electricity, are back-up systems
designed to power cooling pumps and other safety equipment only for a
relatively short period of time]{.underline}. Such [[generators]{.mark}
would likely [fail]{.mark} to operate continuously for a period of
months to years.]{.underline} The longest loss-of-offsite power events
in the United States all lasted less than a week.

Most US nuclear plants are required to have at least a seven-day onsite
supply of fuel for emergency diesel generators, and many have
arrangements to receive prompt deliveries of fuel. Yet [amid the
logistical challenges and social disruptions of a nationwide, long-term
blackout, it appears [unlikely]{.mark} that a steady [fuel]{.mark}
supply [could be]{.mark} transported to and [maintained]{.mark} at every
nuclear plant in the US fleet.]{.underline}

Overloading spent fuel pools should be outlawed. Safety analysts have
warned about the dangers of overloading spent fuel pools since the
1970s. For decades, experts and organizations have argued that in order
to improve safety, sufficiently cooled spent fuel assemblies should be
removed from high-density spent fuel pools and transferred to passively
cooled dry cask storage. Sadly, the NRC has not heeded their advice.

In the face of the NRC's inaction, Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts
introduced The Dry Cask Storage Act in 2014, calling for the thinning
out of spent fuel pools. The act, which Senator Markey has reintroduced
in subsequent congressional sessions, has not passed into law.

The relatively high probability of a nationwide grid collapse, which
would lead to multiple nuclear disasters, emphasizes the need to
expedite the transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage. According to
Frank von Hippel, a professor of public and international affairs
emeritus at Princeton University, the impact of a single accident at an
overstocked spent fuel pool has the potential to be two orders of
magnitude more devastating in terms of radiological releases than the
three Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns combined. If the US grid collapses for
a lengthy period of time, society would likely descend into chaos, as
uncooled nuclear fuel burned at multiple sites and spewed radioactive
plumes into the environment.

The [value of preventing the destruction of US society and untold human
suffering is incalculable]{.underline}. So, on the issue of protecting
people and the environment from spent fuel pool fires, it is surprising
when one learns that promptly transferring the nationwide inventories of
spent fuel assemblies that have been cooled for at least five years from
US pools to dry cask storage would be "relatively inexpensive"---less
than (in 2012 dollars) a total of \$4 billion (\$5.4 billion in today's
dollars). That is far, far less than the monetary toll of losing vast
tracts of urban and rural land for generations to come because of
radioactive contamination.

One should also consider that plant owners are required, as part of the
decommissioning process, to transfer spent fuel assemblies from storage
pools to dry cask storage after nuclear plants are permanently shut
down. So, in accordance with industry protocols, all spent fuel
assemblies at plant sites are intended to eventually be placed in dry
cask storage (before ultimately being transported to a long-term surface
storage site or a permanent geologic repository).

If the NRC continues to allow the industry's mismanagement of [[spent
fuel]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[pose an **existential** threat]{.mark} to
the United States]{.underline}, Congress must be compelled to pass
legislation requiring utilities to swiftly thin out spent fuel pools.

Introduction

[[Civilization relies on]{.underline}]{.mark} a network of [[highly
interdependent]{.mark} critical infrastructure
(**[CI]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [to provide basic
necessities]{.underline} (water, food, shelter, basic goods), [as well
as complex items]{.underline} (computers, cars, space shuttles) [and
services]{.underline} (the internet, cloud computing, global supply
chains), henceforth referred to as industry. [[Electricity]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the electrical [infrastructure that distributes it
plays an important role within industry]{.underline}, providing [a
convenient means to distribute energy able to be converted into various
forms of useful work]{.underline}. Electricity
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** one component of industry albeit a
**[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [[Industry provides the means
to sustain advanced civilization]{.mark}]{.underline} structures and the
citizens that inhabit them. These structures play a critical role in
realizing various futures by [allowing humanity to discover and utilize
new resources, adapt to various environments, [and resist]{.mark}
natural [stressors]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Though industry is capable of resisting small stressors, [**[a]{.mark}
sufficiently [large event can precipitate cascading failure]{.mark} of
CI systems**, [resulting in]{.mark} a [collapse]{.mark} of
industry.]{.underline} If one does not temporally discount the value of
future people, the long-term future (thousands, millions, or even
billions of years) could contain an astronomically large amount of value
\[18\]. Events capable of curtailing the potential of civilization
(existential risks, such as human extinction or an unrecoverable
collapse) would prevent such futures from being achieved, implying
reducing the likelihood of such events is of the utmost importance
\[100\]. Reducing the prevalence of existential risks factors; events,
systemic structures, or biases which increase the likelihood of
extinction but do not cause extinction by themselves is also highly
valuable. [Complete [collapse]{.mark} or degraded function of industry
[would drastically reduce]{.mark} humanity's [capacity to coordinate and
deploy]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}**nology [to prevent]{.mark}
**[ex]{.mark}**istential **[risks]{.mark}**, representing an existential
risk factor]{.underline}. Consequently, [interventions preventing loss
of industry, reducing the magnitude of impacts, or increasing speed of
recovery could be extremely valuable.]{.underline}

Existential risk research is, by nature, future focused, requiring the
investigation of events that have not yet occurred. Futures studies
methodologies are often applied to uncover salient trends or events, and
explore potential causal structures \[54, 123\]. Probabilistic modeling
techniques can then be used to determine the likelihood of such events
occurring, including adequate treatment of uncertainty \[101\]. The
cost-effectiveness modeling approach outlined in this paper is an
example of this, attempting to assess the marginal utility of losing
industry interventions on improving the long-term future. This approach
could guide future efforts to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of
interventions for different risks, existential or otherwise. More
practically, this research can inform prioritization efforts of
industrialized countries by providing estimates of the cost of global
industrial collapse, and the utility of resilience interventions. This
is relevant to the European Union which has a highly industrialized
economy, providing \$2.3 Trillion USD of the \$13.7 Trillion USD global
total of value add manufacturing \[122\]. The EU has shifted toward a
more proactive foresight approach about natural and man-made disasters,
noting the importance of rare high-impact events, systemic risks, and
converging trends requiring better data and forecasting to drive a more
ambitious crisis management system \[47\]. Still, it is clear that most
academic and institutional emphasis has been on "ordinary" rather than
extreme disasters, and risks from industry to the public and environment
rather than widespread failures of industrial services causing harm.

The [[integrated nature]{.mark} of the electric grid]{.underline}, which
is based on centralized generation [[makes the entire system
vulnerable]{.mark} to disruption]{.underline}.1 There are a number of
[anthropogenic and natural catastrophes that could result
in]{.underline} regional-scale electrical [grid failure, which
would]{.underline} be expected to [halt the majority of industries and
machines in that area.]{.underline} A high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) caused by a nuclear weapon could disable electricity over
part of a continent \[16, 48, 66, 93\]. This could destroy the majority
of electrical grid infrastructure, and as fossil fuel extraction and
industry is reliant on electricity \[49\], industry would be disabled.
Similarly, solar storms have destroyed electrical transformers connected
to long transmission lines in the past \[117\]. The Carrington event in
1859 damaged telegraph lines, which was the only electrical
infrastructure in existence at the time. It also caused Aurora Borealis
that was visible in Cuba and Jamaica \[70\]. This could potentially
disable electrical systems at high latitudes, which could represent 10%
of electricity/industry globally. Though solar storms may last less than
the 12 h that would be required to expose the entire earth with direct
line of sight, the earth's magnetic field lines redirect the storm to
affect the opposite side of the earth \[117\].

Lastly, both [physical]{.underline} \[6, 8, 69, 89, 111\] [and cyber
attacks]{.underline} \[3, 63, 90, 96, 118, 128, 130\] [could also
compromise electric grids]{.underline}. Physical attacks include
traditional acts of terrorism such as bombing or sabotage \[130\] in
addition to EMP attacks. Significant actors could scale up physical
attacks, for example by using drones. A scenario could include terrorist
groups hindering individual power plants \[126\], while [a large
adversary could undertake a]{.underline} similar [operation physically
to all plants and electrical grids in a region.]{.underline}

Islamabad : **[There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and
what are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict.
These thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Asia
and **[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace
Studies (PIPS]{.underline}**), an Islamabad-based think tank,
**[[participated by prominent]{.mark} national and [international
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Prof]{.underline}**. Shahram **[Akbarzadeh]{.underline}**, Deakin
University, Australia, **[[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in
the literature on non-state actors]{.underline}**. He called for
empirical research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the
topic, so as to mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular
South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said **[non-state actors often evoke
memories of violent elements]{.underline}**. This despite that as per
definition, non-state actors include organizations working for human
rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted **[[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
**[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}**.

Participants noted over the decades, **[much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim **[Fraihat]{.underline}**, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, **[termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two
parties, though one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}**.
This way, **[domestic conflicts are escalated by external power
intervention]{.underline}**. At the same time, proxy war, if unresolved,
can take the shape of conventional war, the most significant example was
of Vietnam War. **[[In contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
lamented, **[[the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East.

Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for
Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors
involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the
region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states
achieve their interests.

Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University Islamabad
focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's involvement in
Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with Kabul
reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India strategic
cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

**[Dr]{.underline}**. Muhammad Riaz **[Shad]{.underline}**, National
University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting
through proxies gives states an opportunity of
deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

LESS RELEVANT REGION In response to the Iraq war, the United States has
aimed to reduce its role in the Middle East. Three factors have made
that course both more alluring and more possible. First, **[inter[state
conflicts that]{.mark} directly [threatened U.S.]{.mark}
interests]{.underline}** in the past **[[have]{.mark} largely [been
replaced by substate]{.mark} security [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Second, **[[other]{.mark} rising [regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
especially Asia, **[[have taken on more
importance]{.underline}]{.mark}** to U.S. global strategy. And third,
**[the [diversification of]{.mark} global [energy]{.mark} markets [has
weakened oil]{.mark} as a driver]{.underline}** of U.S. policy.
**[[During the Cold War, traditional]{.mark} state]{.underline}**-based
**[[threats pushed]{.mark} the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to play [a]{.mark} major
[role]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Middle East. That role involved not
only ensuring the stable supply of energy to Western markets but also
working to prevent the spread of communist influence and tamping down
the Arab-Israeli conflict so as to help stabilize friendly states. These
**[[efforts were]{.mark} largely [successful]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Beginning in the 1970s, the United States nudged Egypt out of the
pro-Soviet camp, oversaw the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and
solidified its hegemony in the region. **[Despite
challenges]{.underline}** from Iran after its 1979 revolution and from
Saddam Hussein's Iraq throughout the 1990s, **[U.S. dominance was
never]{.underline}** seriously **[in question. The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[contained]{.mark} the Arab-[Israel]{.mark}i conflict, [countered
Saddam]{.mark}'s bid to gain territory]{.underline}** through force
**[in the]{.underline}** 1990--91 **[Gulf War, [and built a]{.mark}
seemingly permanent military [presence]{.mark} in the Gulf [that
deterred]{.mark}]{.underline}** Iran **[[and muffled disputes
among]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Gulf **[[Arab states. Thanks to]{.mark}
all [these]{.mark} efforts, the [chances of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
deliberate **[interstate [war]{.mark} in the Middle East
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps **[[lower]{.mark} now [than]{.mark}
at [any time in]{.mark} the past [50 years]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

AVD

For two reasons, however, such **[[clashes are unlikely to escalate
into]{.mark} all-out [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, **[since [Iran
and Israel do not share a border, it is difficult to see]{.mark} how the
[present hostilities]{.mark} could [spiral into]{.mark} a wide-ranging
[confrontation involving ground operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On
the other hand, if Iran chooses to involve its proxy Hezbollah in
Lebanon, which does share a border with Israel, matters would look quite
different, especially given Hezbollah's exceptional rocket arsenal. This
brings us to a second reason **[war is unlikely: [No party
regards]{.mark} a full-scale [conflict]{.mark} between Israel and Iran
[as]{.mark} in its [strategic]{.mark} interests---Israel and Iran
themselves don't, nor do the U.S. or Russia, or even Hezbollah and
Syria]{.underline}**. Hezbollah may be willing to send advisers and
soldiers to fight in Syria alongside the Shiite militias and the
Revolutionary Guard, but it's in no hurry to entangle Lebanon in the
conflict. In the recent Lebanese parliamentary elections, [Hezbollah
successfully campaigned on domestic issues. [It is doubtful Hezbollah
has]{.mark} much [interest in reprising its role as an Iranian
messenger]{.mark}, which is how it has been perceived by many in Lebanon
during the years of the civil war in Syria.]{.underline} What about
Syria? [[After seven years of civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}, just as
President Bashar al-Assad is at last regaining control of large swathes
of his country, [[Syria also has no interest in serving as the
battleground]{.mark} between Iran and Israel.]{.underline} Even so, as
of now[, [Assad]{.mark} also [needs the Iranian military]{.mark}
presence in order [to assure its survival. Iran]{.mark} meanwhile
[has]{.mark} enough [headaches]{.mark} [with its economy and with
the]{.mark} U.S. [withdrawal from the nuclear deal]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(There is no connection between the American withdrawal from the nuclear
accord and the escalation between Iran and Israel, however. The events
of the past few days have been years in the making, with or without the
nuclear deal, given Iran and Israel's mutually incompatible interests in
the region.) [And [Russia does not look favorably on]{.mark} the
deterioration of a place like [Syria, which is supposed to
generate]{.mark} [economic profits]{.mark} for Moscow through
investments in reconstruction.]{.underline} So what remains for Iran and
the Revolutionary Guards? Iran might adapt its "Yemen model"---support
for the Houthi rebels who launch missiles every few days at Iran's other
regional archenemy, Saudi Arabia---to the Syrian theater. Iran might
seek to challenge Israel from Syria by helping Shiite militias and
Hezbollah advisers establish cells that could launch rockets at Israel
without leaving Iranian fingerprints. In this way Tehran could avoid a
full-fledged war, while exhausting Israel with short but painful jabs
that would harm the country's economy. Yet there are obstacles to this
approach---[[Israel's]{.mark} exceptional [intelligence
capabilities]{.mark} in Syria [have]{.mark} more than once [frustrated
Iranian attempts to land]{.mark} such [blows]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [IAEA Assessment of **Iran's Nuke Program**]{.underline}

Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, discussed the state of Iran's nuclear program on Sunday
on CBS News' Face the Nation; the interview was taped Friday:

I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but
you will see that [[there is an **agreement**]{.mark} in describing this
as a very serious level of damage]{.underline}. It can be, you know,
described in different ways, but [it's clear [that]{.mark} what happened
in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan]{.underline}, where
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} used to have and still has, to some degree,
[[capabilities in]{.mark} terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment
of [**uranium** have been **destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to an
important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an
important setback in terms of those --- of those capabilities. This is
--- this is clear. And now the important issue --- the important thing
is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I
think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the
Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you
know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some
point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess
damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take
place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very
important, the material that they will be producing if they continue
with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is
connected. This is --- this is contingent on negotiations which may or
may not restart, so --- so what we see this here, I think we have a
snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to
quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next
steps. \[Emphasis added.\]

"Dr. Araghchi" is Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister:

[Iran's foreign minister]{.underline}, Abbas Araghchi, [said on Thursday
that the country's nuclear facilities had sustained "significant and
serious damages,"]{.underline} the first official acknowledgment of the
extent of the damages caused by U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran was still "surveilling the
damages and losses," Mr. Araghchi said in an interview with Iran's state
television. But, he added, "I have to say, [the losses have not been
small, and our [facilities have been **seriously
damaged**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Is Iran's nuclear weapons program so destroyed that we never have to
worry about it again? No. Iran has more than 90 million people, two
uranium mines, and depending upon how you measure, either the 25th or
the 37th-largest economy in the world. [If they pour **all their
resources** into developing a nuclear weapon, they can regain lost
ground.]{.underline} Of course, [[developing a]{.mark} nuclear [weapon
in **secret** is **difficult**, and the U.S.]{.mark} has demonstrated it
[can **blow up whatever**]{.mark} the Iranians attempt to
build.]{.underline}

To quantitatively account for natural and forced variability in the
climate system, we created two ensembles, one for the natural, unforced
system and a second ensemble using a range of realistic vertical
profiles for the BC aerosol forcing, consistent with our detailed fire
simulation. The control ensemble was generated using small atmospheric
temperature perturbations (Kay et al., 2015). Notably, the overall
spread of anomalies in both ensembles is very similar. These ensembles
were then used to create "super ensembles" using a statistical emulator,
which allows a robust statistical comparison of our simulated results
with and without the carbon forcing.

[Our [**primary result** is]{.mark} the [**decreased impact** on]{.mark}
global **[climate]{.mark}** indices]{.underline}, such as global average
surface temperature and precipitation, relative to standard scenarios
considered in previous work (e.g., Mills et al., 2014; Pausata et al.,
2016; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, et al., 2007; Stenke et al., 2013).
[[With]{.mark} our finding of **[substantially less]{.mark}** BC
[aerosol]{.mark} being lofted to **stratospheric heights**]{.underline}
(e.g., over a factor of 4 less than in most of the scenarios considered
by previous studies), these [globally averaged [anomalies drop to
**statistically insignificant**]{.mark} levels after the first **several
years**]{.underline} (Figures 14 and 16). [Our [results are]{.mark}
**generally [comparable]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} those predicted by
**[other studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} that considered exchange
scenarios in which [only about 1 Tg of soot is emitted in the **upper
troposphere**]{.underline} (Mills et al., 2008; Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, et al., 2007; Stenke et al., 2013). There are more subtle
suggestions of regional effects, notably in the extent of the region
over which SST differences between ensembles remain significant in the
final years of simulation (Figure 17). Further work is required to
adequately analyze these and other potential regional effects.

[[**Historical analysis** of]{.mark} several large **volcanic
[eruptions]{.mark}** and a recent large fire also [**supports**
this]{.mark} result]{.underline}. For example, Timmreck et al. (2010)
claim that [**[nonlinear]{.mark} aerosol [effects]{.mark}** of the
**Toba Tuff eruption** 74,000 years ago helped [**limit**
significant]{.mark} **global [cooling]{.mark}** impacts to a 2 year time
period and that **any cooling beyond** this time period could be **due
to other effects**.]{.underline} It should be noted that this eruption
was estimated to have produced 106 Tg of ash and comparable amounts of
other gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), while [the estimated amount
of [**soot** produced by]{.mark} a regional [**exchange** is]{.mark} on
the order of 10 Tg or [**5 orders of magnitude**
smaller]{.mark}]{.underline} than the ash (not including gases) produced
by the Toba eruption. Noting that a nuclear exchange is not identical to
volcanic events, it has been asserted that BC particles produced by
fires should have a greater impact on absorbing solar radiation than
even has the significantly larger amounts of ash and various gases
produced by large eruptions (e.g., Robock & Toon, 2010). Likewise,
recent work in analyzing BC emissions from large fires suggests that in
such fires, similar to large volcanic eruptions, [coating of soot
particles with other particles in **[convective eddies]{.mark}** tends
to [increase]{.mark} their [**size** and]{.mark} hence increase their
**subsequent [rainout]{.mark}**]{.underline} (China et al., 2013)
[before they can reach the stratosphere]{.underline}. In fact, the
recent study of Pausata et al. (2016) found that [growth of BC aerosol
via **coagulation** with **[organic carbon]{.mark}** significantly
**[reduces]{.mark}** the [particles\' **lifetime**]{.mark} in the

Conclusion

Indeed, something is happening in [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
the transformation into a new 'El Dorado' has not yet crystallised. The
region [[did not become the **maritime highway**]{.mark}, **resource
arena** [or **military theatre**]{.mark} that [some were fantasising
about]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are different reasons to the current
development. [[On **economic** matters]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
shipping and resource exploitation, [[geophysical conditions **remain
harsh**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There is still a large gap between the
**potential** of shorter sea lanes for commercial shipping and the
**real volumes transiting these routes**]{.underline}. [**Uncertainty**
plays a large role as climate variability needs to be incorporated as a
risk factor in competing with well-established supply chains following
southern shipping routes]{.underline}. Moreover, it will take time
before supply chains will be adjusted towards new shipping routes and a
knowledge base will have to be created about Arctic environments and
shipping. There are, however, factors which could increase this
transition. These factors include more rapid warming of the Arctic
and/or the increase of security risks on other major shipping routes
such as the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca.

With regards to the development of petroleum and natural gas resources,
[[the **fall in the price of oil**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in 2014 [has
had a large impact]{.mark} on new and existing projects in the Arctic.
**[Large projects]{.mark}** in both Russia and Alaska [have been
**delayed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [as the]{.underline} business [case of
[these projects has **difficulty justifying the large investments
needed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to realise them. The main issue of Arctic
resource development is the large investment needed in infrastructure
and technology. Most likely, Russia and China will have the most
geopolitical incentive to continue large projects in the Arctic.

On militarisation, [the Arctic States have indeed developed an armed
presence in the region, but it is not as important as it
was]{.underline} back [in the **Cold War**]{.underline} period.
**[[Institutionalisation of coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** [between
the different powers [has created **understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline}
about the interests of one another [and]{.underline} these [[interests
seem]{.mark} to be [more secured by **peace** and **stability**
than]{.mark} by **[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once again, the
cost of equipment able to operate in the region also plays a role.

#### No Arctic war.

A Battle for Resources?

[Most of the resources in the Arctic are to be found in countries within
**territorial seas** or **exclusive economic zones**]{.underline}.
[Since all the Arctic States have pledged to respect UNCLOS]{.underline}
in the Illulissat Declaration, [[there is **very little chance of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The principle of precaution seems to be
the reason explaining the disputes about the delimitation of the
extended continental shelves, in case something would be found even if
it is unlikely. [Some feared that [a]{.mark} "**[resources driven
conflict]{.mark}**" would occur]{.underline} in the Circumpolar North
after the outbreak of the Ukrainian Crisis; [the phenomenon [did **not
occur**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reason is that [for its own
development, [Moscow **needs the region to remain
peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Käpylä & Mikkola 2015;
Rahbek-Clemmensen 2015). Given Gazprom's earlier decision to involve the
Norwegian StatoilHydro in the development phase of its Arctic Shtokman
gas field, it can even be argued that [Russia will **need to cooperate**
with its Arctic neighbours to develop its Arctic resources
successfully]{.underline}.

Currently, the main producer of petroleum in the Arctic is Russia, where
the offshore Prirazlomnoye field in the Pechora Sea is operated by
Gazprom Neft. This field, which began commercial production in 2013, had
an output of 2.1 million tons of Arctic oil in 2016. In March 2016, the
Goliat field in Norway, a joint venture between Eni and Statoil, started
production of Arctic oil. This field will produce 100,000 barrels of oil
per day. With regards to natural gas, the Snøhvit gas field operated by
Statoil represents the first and primary offshore development in the
Arctic Barents Sea. The giant Russian natural gas field of Shtokman has
dealt with several setbacks mostly from technological challenges, cost
overruns and low gas prices. The cooperation agreement with European
partners Total and Statoil expired in 2012 and further project
development and production start is delayed until further notice.
Another major Arctic Russian natural gas field, Yamal, has experienced
similar setbacks in development. However, as of April 2014, the field
operated by Novatek plans to start producing gas condensate.

In the North American Arctic, increased Arctic natural gas production
can become a reality with the proposed investments in the 'Alaska
Pipeline Project' through a consortium involving ExxonMobil,
ConocoPhillips, BP and TransCanada. This major infrastructure project
would make it possible to transport the natural gas in Alaska's large
Arctic reserves to markets in Canada and the United States. However, the
planned continuation of this high investment project depends for a large
part on high oil and gas prices. A prolonged period of low oil and gas
prices could lead to a delay of the project which is proposed to begin
transporting natural gas by 2025. The largest oil field in the American
Arctic, in Prudhoe Bay, already reached peak production more than two
decades ago. A second field in the Alaskan Arctic is the 'Alpine field',
developed by ConocoPhillips and which has produced oil since 2000. The
extent to which new production fields are to be developed in the Arctic
is to a large extent dependent on a recovery of oil prices and domestic
policies making a trade-off between environmental objections and the
benefits of domestic resource production. In 2015, Royal Dutch Shell,
one of the major players in the American Arctic, decided to abandon its
drilling operations in the Arctic amid sustained low oil prices and
rising pressure about environmental consequences. In October 2016, a
large oil discovery was made in the Alaskan Arctic by Caelus Energy.
This project, expected to start producing oil by 2022, could potentially
offset some of the production declines from the other Arctic oil fields.

In Greenland, oil and gas development is a potential road towards full
independence from the Kingdom of Denmark. To that purpose, a national
oil company, Nunaoil, has been established; it has an automatic 12.5
percent stake in new oil exploration projects and an option to become a
shareholder in oil projects which move to the development phase. Among
the companies which have actively engaged in exploration activities in
the Greenlandic Arctic are ExxonMobil, Chevron, Statoil, Husky Energy
and Cairn Energy. However, also in Greenland, the drop in the oil price
in 2014 has had a large effect on prospective Arctic oil exploration
activities. Total petroleum prospecting, exploration and exploitation
licences (in force) have decreased from nine in 2014 to three in 2015
and zero in 2016 (Mineral Licence and Safety Authority, 2017). The
Scottish energy company Cairns Energy, one of the major players in
Greenland's petroleum exploration, is evaluating its Greenlandic
portfolio as no commercial oil players have been found yet. In 2014,
Statoil decided not to extend three of its four Greenlandic exploration
licences.

[Asian emerging powers have expressed their interest in Arctic
resources]{.underline}. However, [their contribution to Arctic economic
development **remains modest**]{.underline}. China, Japan and South
Korea are investing in resources exploration in Greenland (Tonami,
2016). Both [China and Japan have expressed their will to cooperate with
Russian companies]{.underline} and have also expressed their will to
invest in the Yamal's liquified natural gas exploitation. However, [the
discussions are advancing at a **really slow pace**]{.underline}.
(Pollmann, 2016; Sorensen and Klimenko, 2017).

Arctic Militarisation?

If we analysed the numbers provided by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Wezeman, October 16), we can see that Russia is
leading in terms of air and sea capacities, while Canada has the
strongest land capabilities but strongly lacks specific Arctic
capacities such as icebreakers.

It is interesting to draw a comparison between the current military
activities and the Cold War to get some more insight about what happens
today in the Arctic. The numbers gathered by Lassi Heininen, Alexander
Sergunin and Gleb Yarovoy:

If one observes the data closely, one can draw the following conclusion:

USSR's presence in the 80s outnumbers the current Russian presence. The
same can be said for the US.

NATO has more submarines, lager ships and aircraft that are Arctic
capable than Russia. The mention "Arctic capable" is important; these
forces can be elsewhere and are not permanently stationed in the region.
Russia, thus, remains the strongest Arctic power.

[Although there is a military presence, we cannot speak about a military
theatre like the region has witnessed during the **Cold
War**.]{.underline} The reason behind the Russian military presence in
the region is threefold: 1) to assert Moscow's sovereignty over the
region 2) to protect the Russian companies operating in the region and
3) to show the entire world that Russia is still an Arctic power. Thus,
the [[Russian military presence in the region is tied to]{.mark}
**prestige**, [**economics** and **energy
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike, the Cold War, the logic is
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} grounded in a [**[bloc-to-bloc
conflicts]{.mark}** and **deterrence**]{.underline} (Heininen et al.,
2014).

A few [scholars have used the expression]{.underline} "**[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}**" [to speak about the lack of
conflict]{.underline} in the Arctic. According to them, [[the]{.mark}
Arctic's current [stability is explained by the **lack of resources in
contested areas**]{.mark} or in the high seas]{.underline}3 [[and the
capacity of]{.mark} **regional fora**, such as [the **Arctic Council**,
to **defuse tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}4 (Käpylä and Mikkola, 2016).

remains **highly deterred** from]{.mark}]{.underline} taking [action
against the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies]{.underline}, and
**[especially [nuclear action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If one assumes

value]{.mark} its [nuclear forces more]{.mark}]{.underline} in the

to be ineffective in Ukraine and elsewhere, [[it remains **far from

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}ly [shooting]{.mark} at one
another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might end.]{.underline}**
Q: [Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No.
The U.S. has **not attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not
attacked** the U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely
likely at this point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of
[Russian]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is
there a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?
D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, the [U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a way that is
**proportional**]{.underline} [but **not escalatory.**]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark} what would lead to]{.underline}
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} direct
[combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [[Russians understand]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} **too [are vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also
quite likely that [with Russian forces already **overextended** fighting
against **Ukraine**, [Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second
major conflict** is not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q:
Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in
terms of the human toll and economics? Has Russia made resource and
allocation adjustments in the past months that will allow it to sustain
these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war efforts appear to be
unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of soldiers and expended
significant amounts of ammunition, such that commanders in the field are
complaining about shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have
to switch from offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of
people and materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth
is very slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but
there are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive]{.mark} in
2023.]{.underline}

Russian Assertiveness

The notion that a **[[major war]{.mark} among]{.underline}**
**[developed]{.underline}** **[countries [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[wildly unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[has]{.underline}**
**[frequently]{.underline}** **[been taken to have been challenged by
the]{.underline}** experience of the **[armed dispute
between]{.underline}** **[Russia and]{.underline}** neighboring
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** **[that began in 2014]{.underline}**. It
resulted in the peaceful, if extortionary, transfer of Crimea, a large
peninsular chunk of Ukraine, to Russia, and then in a sporadic, and
ultimately stalemated, civil war in Ukraine in which ethnic Russian
secessionist groups in a portion of Ukraine's east were supported by
Russia.

The fear, in particular, is that Russia's successful expansion --
justified, it says, in part by the desire to protect persecuted ethnic
Russians in a neighboring land -- will cause, or tempt, it to expand
elsewhere reflecting the manner in which Hitler expanded in order, he
said, to protect ethnic Germans from persecution particularly in areas
to his east. Indeed, NATO planners busily check roads in Western Europe
to see if they are suitable for military transport in the event that
Russia launches a full-scale invasion of the continent.50 And in 2018,
at the badgering of President Donald Trump, NATO countries all agreed to
increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product
by 2024, something he implied was a triumph although it merely
reaffirmed a commitment they had made at the time of the Crimean
takeover in 2014. 51

In the settlement that led to the unification of Germany in 1990, the
United States verbally promised that, although East Germany would now
become part of a NATO country, there would be no further expansion of
the alliance to the east.52 A few years later, however, NATO began just
such an expansion very much against many agitated concerns by
specialists. Among these was George Kennan who warned that "the Russians
will react quite adversely" and called the policy "a tragic mistake,"
pointing out that "there was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anyone else."53

The expansion was carried out with good intentions. and there were many
statements seeking to mollify Russian concerns including offering it a
sort of adjunct position in the alliance with the possible further
prospect of actual membership.54 Nevertheless, although the Russians
were powerless to stop the expansion, they greeted it with considerable
dismay and opposition, voiced not just by Communists and by
ultra-nationalists, but by very many in the Western-oriented elite. This
should have been a warning. But it wasn't. As Christopher Fettweis
observes, "In the 1990s, Russian protests regarding NATO expansion --
although nearly universal -- were not taken seriously, since U.S.
planners believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all."55

The situation was strained further in 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia, a
country with considerable historical links to Russia, securing the
secession of the Kosovo province as Russia stood by helplessly, a
development discussed in Chapter 3. Russia sometimes sees this as
precedent for its Crimean seizure.

As he was taking office as president of Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin
did tell a British interviewer, "Russia is part of European culture and
I can't imagine my country cut off from what we often refer to as the
'civilized world'."56 However, the strains from NATO expansion and from
the Kosovo experience were already in place, and they gradually
escalated in the new century as Putin's regime became increasingly
autocratic and as the United States, and particularly Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, together with its West European allies issued strong
support for anti-Putin protests that took place in Russia in 2011--12.
57

Russia's concern about NATO enlargement focused especially on the
possible Westernization of Ukraine, the large new country to its west
that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. One American observer
who had served in the Obama administration supplies an arresting
parallel: "The United States would hardly sit by idly if Russia formed
an alliance with Mexico and Canada and started building military
installations along the US border."58

Unlike the neighboring countries to its west in what had previously been
known as "East Europe," Ukraine, although fairly open and democratic,
had become a basket case economically despite an enormous potential. A
few statistics may serve. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,
Ukraine's per capita GDP was higher than Poland's; 25 years later, it
was less than onethird that of Poland.59 In a study comparing 25
post-Communist countries, Ukraine comes out dead last in economic
growth.60 Ukraine is now the poorest country in Europe.61

In this, it was like other, smaller counties that essentially lie
between Russia and Western Europe: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Belarus. These countries have been characterized not by
the substantial political liberalization and economic development that
has variously taken place in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Romania, and in
countries that emerged out of Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1991.
Rather, the "in-between" countries, led by the most important, Ukraine,
suffer from a set of what Samuel Charap and Timothy Colton call
"post-Soviet pathologies": dysfunctional governmental institutions,
economies lacking functioning markets, a rule of law that is weak or
absent, patronal politics, close links between political power and
control of major economic assets, and "pervasive corruption."62

In the case of Ukraine, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by outside
efforts from Russia and from Europe to influence the country. These have
made it easier for Ukraine to avoid desperately-needed reforms.63 Among
these are huge economic distortions concerning energy. The world average
for energy consumption per dollar of GDP is 10 British thermal units.
For the US it is 7.5, for the UK 3.8, for Ukraine 56.3. 64

Things came to a head when mass protests by Western-oriented Ukrainians
broke out in the capital city, Kiev. Their duly elected president, who
was perhaps even more corrupt than his equally duly elected
predecessors, had been juggling various opposing aid offers from the
West and from Russia. When he more or less accepted the (higher) Russian
bid, protests broke out, and these endured through the cold and snowy
winter of 2013--14 heightened by sporadic violence by security forces
and by elements within the protest movement, particularly those from the
highly anti-Russian far right.65

In February 2014, Ukraine's president fled to Russia abruptly leaving
the extravagant private zoo he had created behind.66 In the subsequent
chaos, parliament removed provisions that had previously allowed the use
of Russian as an official language under some conditions.67

Largely ignored in these development were the interests of Russian
speakers in the country, some 30 percent of the population, who are
concentrated in the east and south and were decidedly unsympathetic to
the Kiev protests.68 This was particularly the case in the large Crimea
peninsula to the south where Russia, by an agreement brokered when the
Soviet Union split up in 1991, maintains a substantial naval base for
its Black Sea Fleet. Putin was alarmed at the developments in Kiev where
anti-Russian ideologues now occupied one-third of the cabinet seats. He
was also deeply concerned that the new government might abrogate or fail
to renew the lease on the naval base, seen to be vital national asset.69
And he was doubtless miffed that Western leaders had boycotted the
winter Olympics he had hosted a few months earlier.70

He bolstered troop strength at the naval base, and soon men in green
uniforms without insignia (known as "little green men") were fanning out
in Crimea occupying military and government facilities.71 Crimean
Russians often felt neglected over the years by government in Kiev, and
they feared after the fall of the president that they would be violently
persecuted.72 The local Crimean authorities organized a referendum on
secession and on March 16, 2014, a vote, boycotted by many, was held in
which 97 percent of those who voted supposedly supported leaving Ukraine
and joining Russia. Backed enthusiastically by his parliament and by the
citizenry of Russia, Putin graciously accepted the request.

Meanwhile, in Donbas -- areas abutting Russia in eastern Ukraine --
local Russians, emboldened by the events in Crimea, organized a
secession movement, setting up their own ad hoc governments. Ukrainian
armed forces, led initially mainly by volunteer paramilitaries, were
sent to put them down.73 Aided by infiltrators from Russia, the
secessionists were able to hold them to a stalemate. Over 10,000 were
killed in the violence.74

Ukraine cut off financial subsidies, electricity, and water supplies to
Crimea, and tourism, an important Crimean industry, dropped
precipitously. But Russia, at considerable cost, worked to alleviate
these problems, and in 2018 a 12-mile \$3 billion bridge -- the contract
went to one of Putin's buddies, a former judo partner -- had been
constructed to link Crimea with Russia, a country that, otherwise, ranks
ninety-fourth in the world in infrastructure. Putin drove the first
truck across the span himself.75 Efforts to integrate Crimea into Russia
have been extensive, and Russian retirees (especially military ones) are
encouraged to move there even as those opposed to the Russian takeover
often emigrate to Ukraine.

If the goal of Russia was to keep Ukraine from seeking to embrace the
West while, in Robert Person's words, "establishing a pliant pro-Russian
regime in Kiev," its efforts failed miserably.76 As one observer
predicted at the time, "Far from dissuading Ukrainians from seeking a
future in Europe, Moscow's moves will only foster a greater sense of
nationalism in all parts of the country and turn Ukrainian elites
against Russia, probably for a generation."77 Or as Daniel Treisman
observed in the aftermath, "If Putin's goal was to prevent Russia's
military encirclement, his aggression in Ukraine has been a tremendous
failure, since it has produced the exact opposite."78

In addition, [**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[experience
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [2014]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}**
and crisis in Ukraine **[[suggests]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
**[countries cannot engage in]{.underline}** such **[enterprises
without]{.underline}** **[[automatic]{.mark}ally]{.underline}**
**[paying a substantial]{.underline}** **[economic price -- it is
something like an]{.underline}** **[[economic doomsday]{.mark}
machine]{.underline}**. Because of its antics, **[Russia suffered a
[decline in]{.mark} the]{.underline}** [**[value]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its [currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[capital flight]{.underline}**, **[a drop in its]{.underline}**
[**[stock market]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
decline in]{.underline}** **[foreign [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
And, perhaps most importantly, **[there was a]{.underline}** **[very
substantial drop]{.underline}** **[in confidence by investors, buyers,
and sellers]{.underline}** throughout the world, a condition that is
likely to last for years, even decades.79 As Charap and Colton stress,
"Moscow is at serious risk of permanently alienating the entire EU,
which as a bloc has long been Russia's largest trading partner and
direct investor."80 One prominent British observer puts it even more
starkly, suggesting that the events "mark the end of an era, the end of
the hope that Russia could be incorporated into a united and peaceful
Europe."81 As part of this, Russia's behavior has set off a determined
effort by Europeans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy
supplies -- a change that could be permanent. And **[the]{.underline}**
**[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of]{.underline}** the conflict and
of supporting its new distant dependencies **[have been visited by
Russia on itself]{.underline}**. Crimea was less well off economically
than most of Ukraine and required subsidies from Kiev.82 And the Donbas
region was heavily subsidized by Ukraine as well.83 These
**[burdens]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** now **[[shifted
to]{.mark} Russia]{.underline}**.

**[There have been]{.underline}** other **[economic costs]{.underline}**
as well. Economic **[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been
**[visited on Russia]{.underline}** **[by other states]{.underline}**.
Although especially costly to Europe, they were embraced after rebels in
eastern Ukraine (perhaps accidentally) shot down a civilian airliner
with a missile presumably supplied by Russia.84 Unrelated to the crisis,
there was a severe drop in prices for oil on the international market, a
development that is especially harmful to Russia: for every decline of
\$25 in the price of oil, Russia experiences a nearly 2 percent decline
in GNP, and oil and gas sales fund about 36 percent of the Russian
annual budget. The economic pain inflicted by the oil price drop has
been much greater -- perhaps four times greater -- than that of the
sanctions.85

There is **[likely]{.underline}** as well **[to be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[special political cost for
Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Since he came to power in 2000, there has
been a steady improvement in Russia each year in GDP per capita. That
process was reversed in 2014. From 2014--17, real disposable income fell
by 15 percent.86 Aspirational purchases as for homes and cars have
shifted to ones devoted to daily needs.87 And Russia's Stabilization
Fund, built up when oil prices were high and meant to fund pension
payments and to support the ruble, was significantly depleted and may
run out of money entirely. Over time, **[some]{.underline}** may **[see
this as a]{.underline}** [**[break]{.underline}** **[with his promise
to]{.underline}** **[provide]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the]{.underline}** **[[stability]{.mark} and order]{.underline}**
**[necessary to allow economic progress]{.underline}** to take place.88

The **[developments in Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014
**[were]{.underline}** **[unsettling]{.underline}**, of course. However,
**[it is]{.underline}** **[impressive]{.underline}** that **[the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** Western
[**[Europe]{.underline}** **[never]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even [came
close to]{.mark} seriously considering [the use of]{.mark} direct
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deal with the issue. Although the
crisis created, as Steven Pinker notes, "just the kinds of tensions that
in the past had led to great-power wars," nothing like that took
place.89 In fact, **[the West behaved in much]{.underline}** **[the same
way it would have]{.underline}** behaved **[if it had]{.underline}**
**[not possessed]{.underline}** **[a great and expensive]{.underline}**
**[military capacity]{.underline}**. Indeed, President Barack Obama, who
presided over the episode, was given to taunting his hawkish critics:
"Now, if there is somebody in this town that would claim that we would
consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, they
should speak up and be very clear about it."90

The **[events]{.underline}** **[inspired concerns]{.underline}** that
**[Putin had or has wider intentions]{.underline}**.91 The
**[natural]{.underline}** **[next step]{.underline}**, suggest some,
**[would be some sort of invasion of the]{.underline}** **[Baltic
states]{.underline}** of Latvia, Lithuania, and/or Estonia.
**[Each]{.underline}**, like Ukraine, **[has a Russian
minority]{.underline}** which, in many cases, has not blended in well
with the majority culture and might even consider itself to be
persecuted.

West Point's Robert Person has **[looked at]{.underline}** the
**[parallels]{.underline}** **[and finds them wanting]{.underline}**.92
To begin with, **[[Ukraine has]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Person calls
"**[a]{.underline}** **[deep [symbolic meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[for Russia]{.underline}**." It had been part of the Russian empire
since the sixteenth century and is often considered to be "the cradle of
eastern Slavic civilization." Moreover, Crimea did not become part of
Ukraine until it was "gifted" to that Soviet republic in 1954 by Nikita
Khrushchev in a process that was quixotic and arbitrary and never
actually made official even by the regulations of Soviet or Communist
law.93 And, of course, Crimea's Russian naval base added special
significance. **[By contrast]{.underline}**, continues Person,
**[Latvia]{.underline}**, **[Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Estonia]{.underline}**, unlike Ukraine, **[have frequently enjoyed
an]{.underline}** **[independent status]{.underline}**, **[and
[Russians]{.mark} "have]{.underline}** **[[long
recognized]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[the [Baltics
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[culturally and historically
[different]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[from Russia]{.underline}**."
Moreover, **[Russians]{.underline}** **[in the Baltics]{.underline}**
**[[do not]{.mark} seem to [have]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[separatist]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** not least in part **[because they
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** much **[[higher standards]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}** do their **[counterparts
o]{.underline}**n **[the other side of the border]{.underline}**. And
**[because the Baltic states are members of the]{.underline}**
**[European Union]{.underline}** **[and its associated]{.underline}**
**[Schengen zon]{.underline}**e, **[their citizens would no
longer]{.underline}** **[enjoy the]{.underline}** associated **[ease of
travel to the continent]{.underline}** if they became part of Russia.94

In all, then, **[the]{.underline}** **[[notion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[that [Putin]{.mark}'s Russia [is on an]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[expansionary mission]{.underline}**]{.mark}, so commonly voiced at
the time of the 2014 events, **[seems to]{.underline}** **[[have little
substance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.95 It has **[[not]{.mark} even [sought
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[officially annex]{.underline}**
**[separatist areas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. A special issue of the journal Daedalus,
published in 2017, ran a series of essays dealing with Russia's future.
None envisioned territorial expansion.96

Definitions of superpower status common during the Cold War generally
stressed the possession of stocks of nuclear weapons. If that criterion
continued to be embraced, Russia should still probably be considered a
superpower. However, as Dmitri Trenin points out, **[Russia
"[has]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[few]{.mark} formal
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[no satellite states]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} \... **[[no]{.mark}
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}** to compare with the comprehensive dogma
of Marxism-Leninism." Moreover, "although it is still a nuclear
superpower, **[it [lags]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[far]{.underline}**
**[behind the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates in
non-nuclear [military]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Economically, Russia]{.underline}**
-- with its estimated 1.5 percent of the global gross domestic product
-- **[is a dwarf]{.underline}**."97 Its GDP ranks twelfth in the world,
but is only one-fifteenth that of the United States and about half that
of California. Moreover, GDP growth in Russia has been weak with recent
figures at about 1.8 percent per year, and it relies heavily on selling
energy abroad: nearly 50 percent of its exports are in oil and gas. Its
**[[population]{.mark} is]{.underline}**
**[[shrinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** and may, according to medium-term
projections, be reduced to 125 million by 2094 from the current level of
about 148 million. **[For an economy that is]{.underline}** **[more
people-intensive]{.underline}** **[than other advanced economies,
[this]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[spells trouble]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
As Barack Obama pointed out derisively, if undiplomatically, in his
final news conference as president, "Their **[economy doesn't
produce]{.underline}** **[anything that anybody wants]{.underline}**
**[to buy]{.underline}**, except oil and gas and arms. They don't
innovate."98

The (rather **[bizarre) Russia suffers from]{.underline}** the same
problems as the "in-between" counties as discussed above while
**[being]{.underline}** **[[burdened]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition
**[[by a]{.mark} much larger military budget -- although]{.underline}**
**[[weak]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** also **[been reflected [in
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[shrinking]{.underline}**
**[military]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[budget]{.underline}**, down about
5 percent in 2018 from 2017. Like China, it has **[devolved into a form
of]{.underline}** **[crony capitalism]{.underline}**
**[where]{.underline}** **[[property rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[are [insecure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[capital
[flight]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is [common]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[is
[rampant]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[economic [stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Anders Aslund concludes, the state
has been captured by a small group of top officials with the topmost
being Vladimir Putin, who has 20 palaces, four yachts, 58 aircraft, and
a collection of watches worth \$600,000. 99

**[[Ukraine]{.mark} episode]{.underline}** of 2014
**[[seems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the Korean invasion of 1950,
**[to]{.underline}** **[be [a one-off]{.mark} -- a]{.underline}**
**[unique]{.underline}**, **[opportunistic]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** probably **[under-considered]{.underline}**
**[escapade that]{.underline}** **[proved to be unexpectedly costly to
the perpetrators]{.underline}**. As with the Korean case, **[massive
[extrapolation is]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[unjustified and
[ill-advised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, the Ukrainian venture,
contrary to much initial speculation, does not seem to be a
game-changer.100

As Trenin points out, **[Moscow's]{.underline}** **[most important
objective]{.underline}** **[is to reassert its role as a]{.underline}**
**[great power]{.underline}** **[with a global reach]{.underline}**.
However, **[it does]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}** **[seek to
impose its own model on]{.underline}** **[the world]{.underline}**. In
all this, [**[neither side]{.underline}** **[envisions
a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[real [shooting war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[against its adversary]{.underline}** **[and neither
wants]{.underline}** to allow **[the situation to become]{.underline}**
**[uncontrollable]{.underline}**.101

Norway defines the Arctic as the areas between the Arctic Circle and the
North Pole. Although the region has remained stable for a long time,
[[the most recent Norwegian]{.underline}]{.mark} government Arctic
[[Policy]{.underline}]{.mark} \[59\] clearly [[states that Russian
military activity is a threat and that Norway relies on a strong NATO
presence in the area.]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic issues are at the core
of the country\'s foreign policy; almost half a million of its citizens
live in the area. Although it is not densely populated, it covers a
[[third of Norway\'s territory]{.underline}]{.mark} and most of its
maritime exclusive economic zone. It is also rather well integrated with
the rest of the country in practice \[60\]. Officially, the most
commonly used term [[is "High North]{.underline}]{.mark}", which comes
from the Norwegian word nordområdene (officially "the northern regions",
but in English "High North" is mostly used to refer to northern areas in
connection to foreign policy and international relations, especially
Svalbard, and the states around the Barents Sea). Russian relations are
an important factor in this context \[61\]. The politically loaded term
'High North' is connected to "efforts to safeguard Norwegian interests
through various initiatives and cross-border cooperation in the North
Calotte region and the Barents region as a whole" \[59\]. Interest in
developing a more robust Arctic policy has grown in recent years in
Norway because of climate change, which allows more activity in the
polar areas, technological development and increasing commercial
activity \[62\]. At the same time, [[there is no "scramble for the
Arctic", despite the media claims]{.underline}]{.mark} \[63\]. [[The
area has been characterised by political stability and well-functioning
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[62\].

The Arctic Ocean may be the world's smallest but it looms large in the
imagination. Remote and unique, the Arctic is, for some at least, the
most romanticized ocean in the world. It has been fueling legends and
ambitions for centuries, and continues to fuel new geopolitical myths
today.

[Global dynamics, from climate change to the decline of American
hegemony and tech]{.underline}nological revolution, [are reshaping the
Arctic.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [mythmaking about the Arctic
continues to distort the narratives available to both public and elite
audiences.]{.underline} Heather Exner-Pirot beautifully explains how
easy this can be and, as Josh Tallis has written, the phantom of Arctic
misgovernance can be used to raise alarm about an unusual gap in Arctic
security governance. In reality, though, the Arctic is profoundly
normal.

The following is an effort to disassemble the leading myths about the
Arctic Ocean and to underscore nuggets of truth underlying the legends.
The natural tendency, noted above, for people to process their
understanding of the Arctic through the most dramatic filter possible,
is not easy to counteract by listing mundane realities. But falling for
the hype is not a good way to make policy. Refuting these myths can put
the focus back on more mundane, but ultimately more valuable, solutions.

The Legendary Arctic Scramble

Most of the [modern Arctic myths and legends are spicing up mundane
realities with added drama]{.underline}. For example, it's [common to
see the Arctic referred to as a battleground for valuable natural
resources.]{.underline} It's the "\$1 Trillion Ocean", [holding massive
reserves of oil and gas]{.underline} (or one trillion dollars' worth of
critical minerals, take your pick), [with echoes of Dr. Evil.
Competition over resources is framed as a "race" or "battle," although
it is often unclear what winning might mean.]{.underline} Industry and
science have long known that the Arctic holds a significant endowment of
natural resources. **[Prospecting and [development in the Arctic lag
behind]{.mark} that of [other]{.mark} [regions due to]{.mark} the
significant [logistical challenges and]{.mark} resulting [extra
costs]{.mark} relating to arctic operations]{.underline}**. [[Resource
deposits]{.mark} in the Arctic [must be of a higher grade or size to
attract investors and overcome]{.mark} the added [risk]{.mark} to
capital.]{.underline} In short, [it has historically been [cheaper to
look elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} And that largely remains true:
[[There has not been a flood of]{.mark} investment and new
[development]{.mark} into the Arctic.]{.underline}

Rather than unclaimed, ungoverned space, the Arctic Ocean and
surrounding landmass are almost entirely sovereign lands and waters of
the eight Arctic states. Yes, there is a small area of high seas, the
central Arctic Ocean. This area is under a fishing moratorium and can
only be accessed through traversing an Arctic state's waters (plus
likely stopping in an Arctic state port). And yet [the myth of an Arctic
wild west persists:]{.underline} "As a consequence of the rapidly
disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an [[increase in
unclaimed]{.mark} ocean and land [territory]{.mark}, beyond any nation's
control, that [countries]{.mark} are **[attempt]{.mark}**ing [to
claim]{.mark} jurisdiction over]{.underline}," proclaims one analysis.
[While this is a common argument, it [is **factually
incorrect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [is linking two separate issues
into one misleading causal chain: the decline in Arctic sea ice due to
climate change, and the ongoing process of defining boundaries and
spaces under international law.]{.underline} In fact, **[[there is no
unclaimed]{.underline}]{.mark}** land **[[territory in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [there is just one maritime boundary
disagreement, between the United States and Canada, over a tiny slice of
the Beaufort Sea]{.underline}.

Perhaps the "Great Arctic Race" is about the [[overlapping
claims]{.underline}]{.mark} to the central Arctic Ocean seabed. The U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) permits coastal states to
claim areas of the extended continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical
mile exclusive economic zone, if they can prove that these areas are a
natural prolongation of their continental shelf. Russia, Denmark (via
Greenland), and Canada have overlapping claims in the central Arctic.
Thus far, they [have]{.underline} [all [adhered to]{.mark} the process
of defining these claims in accordance with **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Russia's law-abiding approach to the
Arctic shelf claims is a rare bright spot in the country's foreign
policy.]{.underline}**

The U.N. convention and seabed claims have been in the spotlight
recently as interest grows in seabed mining for critical minerals.
[Seabed [mining is not likely to drive conflict]{.mark} over Arctic
shelf claims]{.underline}. The [central [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
Ocean --- over 200 nautical miles from any coast --- [[is]{.mark} also
an incredibly [inhospitable]{.mark} area for resource
extraction]{.underline}. The Arctic Ocean still freezes in the winter,
and is sunk in the frigid darkness of the polar night. The [seabed
mining]{.underline} industry, like most global industry, [is likely to
look for less costly options in warmer latitudes]{.underline}. While it
cannot be assumed that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} will continue
pursuing its shelf claims in accordance with international law, it [is
likely to [use]{.mark} lower-cost [tools like lawfare
or]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation [warfare
[to complicate]{.mark} central [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [claims]{.mark},
[rather than]{.mark} apply high-cost and hard-to-sustain
[military]{.mark} options]{.underline}.

**[The [Myth of]{.mark} Increasing Accessibility and Arctic
[Shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [idea that climate change is increasing accessibility in the Arctic
is repeated so often that it is taken for granted]{.underline}. There is
an element of truth here --- the thick cap of multiyear Arctic sea ice
that has shaped the region for thousands of years is
[melting]{.underline} away and will soon be gone. But that [is just one
piece of a bigger puzzle]{.underline}, and the net [effect of
**[climate]{.mark} change in the Arctic [is making]{.mark} human
[activity harder, not easier]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Shrinking]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark} leaves coastlines [unprotected
from]{.mark} stronger, more frequent [storms]{.mark}. Coastal erosion is
higher in the Arctic than anywhere else, threatening U.S. radar
installations]{.underline}. [[Thawing]{.mark} permafrost causes
subsidence, [destroying infrastructure]{.mark} and saddling Arctic
states with massive costs]{.underline} --- highest in Russia. Permafrost
thaw will cause many more disasters in coming years, in Russia and
elsewhere. Massive [[wildfires]{.mark} further [endanger]{.mark}
communities and infrastructure in [the North]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
sea, increased storminess and stronger waves create hazards, along with
increases in drifting ice. [At the heart of it all lies
[uncertainty]{.mark} --- [a]{.mark} powerful [dissuading
factor.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Arctic shipping lanes replacing Suez and Panama is another related
myth]{.underline}. When crisis erupts in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, or
the Panama Canal, it is tempting to point north to emerging Arctic
shipping lanes as alternatives. [[On paper, Arctic shipping]{.mark}
routes appear to [offer]{.mark} considerable [savings]{.mark} of
distance, time, and fuel between northern ports in Asia, Europe, and
North America.]{.underline} However, **[[in practice,]{.mark} these
shipping [routes remain]{.mark} largely
[notional]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Over the last decade, [destinational
Arctic maritime activity has ticked up,]{.underline} mostly driven by
Russia's Yamal liquified natural gas project and expansion at Canada's
Mary River Mine. Container ships and roll-on roll-offs are barely
present, and this type of traffic has showed no change in the past
decade.

It is clear that [Canada has no interest in opening the Northwest
Passage]{.underline} to international shipping. Furthermore, the
[[complex routes]{.underline}]{.mark} of the passage [[have]{.mark}
draft [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}, significant [remaining ice,
[and inadequate charting]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} [has been personally
driving the effort to develop the Northern Sea Route]{.underline},
imposing an ambitious timeline for cargo growth, [reality is not keeping
pace]{.underline}. The [route is plagued by its own draft limitations
and lack of supporting infrastructure, as well as unpredictable ice
hazards.]{.underline} International [shipping vanished following the
2022 invasion of Ukraine, and while cargo totals have rebounded and
grown in the past two years, the **[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute [is functionally]{.mark} a route [for]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark}-flagged [ships]{.mark} of all sorts to carry oil and
gas to Asian markets]{.underline} (and bring in construction materials
for future developments, which have been weakened by sanctions).

The Myth of Russian Dominance and American Indifference

A large body of [mythmaking threatens to create a security
crisis]{.underline} in the Arctic [by sketching a 10-foot-tall Russia
intent on conquering the region]{.underline} and controlling the ocean
and casting the United States as an impotent weakling. These [outsize
legends are used to justify massive **spending increases in the
Arctic**,]{.underline} as well as significantly stronger measures
against Russia, both of which could **[contribute to
escalation]{.underline}** in the region [and also ripple across the
global balance]{.underline}.

[Russia's so-called "dominance" of the Arctic has been treated as
gospel.]{.underline} It is true that over half of the Arctic coastline
is Russian territory, and nearly half of the people living in the Arctic
live in Russia. And yet the discourse of Russian dominance in the Arctic
goes beyond geography. It also presents Russia's position as a threat to
the United States and to the entire Arctic Ocean. Of course, Moscow does
everything it can to nourish this sense of threat. Planting a flag at
the seabed of the North Pole --- possibly the most effective Russian
public relations stunt ever --- was a purely symbolic act, but continues
to serve as a reference point. Dropping paratroopers at the North Pole,
or unfurling a giant banner on the ice, are also gestures that feed the
legend.

[Arguments about Russia's so-called dominance of the Arctic reveal more
about America's own insecurities than the facts on the
ground]{.underline}. This framing creates a sense of unnecessary urgency
and relies on a set of measures that together would badly warp U.S.
strategic planning. Part of this is [the]{.underline} [legendary
**[icebreaker gap,]{.mark} thoroughly [debunked]{.mark}** by Paul Avey.
Does Russia dominate the Arctic with its icebreakers? Or does it just
have [a reasonable number]{.mark} of icebreakers [for its]{.mark} 24,000
kilometer Arctic [coastline]{.mark}, along which Putin is desperately
thirsting to build an international shipping lane that has so far failed
to catch on?]{.underline} [Sober analyses of Russia's power and strategy
in the Arctic need to be facts-based, rather than dealing in terms of
dominance.]{.underline}

Yes, [[Russian military]{.underline}]{.mark} [capabilities and
capacities [in the Arctic are]{.mark} substantive]{.underline}. It is
widely recognized that Russian leadership began to rebuild and expand
Arctic military capabilities and capacities as soon as it was able to,
starting in the early 2000s. [Most authoritative analyses note that
these installations and systems are primarily [defensive]{.mark} in
nature,]{.underline} [intended to help control and protect Russia's
economic and strategic interests in the Arctic,]{.underline} although
they could of course be useful in supporting aggression and, as
Katarzyna Zysk notes, Russian strategic thinking does not clearly
differentiate between offence and defense. [All great powers have
military bases along their coastlines, and Russia has both strategic and
economic interests to protect in its Arctic territory.]{.underline}

And if fears over Russia are not enough[, another myth holds that China
is coming for the Arctic]{.underline}. [Or that Chinese-Russian
cooperation will open the door for Chinese dominance in the
Arctic]{.underline}. As Marc Lanteigne has explained[, **[relations
between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic are]{.mark}** far more
**[complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And others have noted that the
myth of China's growing influence in the Arctic is mostly serving
Beijing's interests. It is important to watch the broader trajectory of
Russian-Chinese relations and not rush to assumptions about China's
future in the Arctic.

In parts as a result of fears over Russian dominance, claims that the
U.S. Department of Defense "needs to do more in the Arctic" have also
become commonplace. The United States has identified several critical
gaps in operational capabilities and capacities in the Arctic, including
in the National Strategy for the Arctic Region as well as the Department
of Defense's Arctic strategy. The most significant gap is the North
Warning System, and the ongoing effort to replace this critical system.
Canada has also underscored its commitment to upgrade the key
continental defense architecture, most recently in an Arctic-focused
defense policy update. But it's also important to note that the United
States has significant Arctic military capabilities, including the
highest concentration of fifth-generation aircraft in the world, as well
as an airborne division in Alaska, along with a North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) region. U.S. Navy submarines operate and train
regularly in the Arctic Ocean.

In the current budget context, in which the Department of Defense faces
flat and tight budgets, there are not free-floating resources to build
up any but the most vital capabilities in the Arctic. Broad calls for
significant spending increases in the Arctic are divorced from the
reality of spending needs in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, and from U.S.
national strategic priorities.

#### No [Russian]{.underline} nuclear use.

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Russia / Arctic War\-\--AT: Warming Causes

#### The Arctic is stable and politically insulated from warming 

**Valberg 24** (Anna Valberg, M.A. in Political Science from University

-- DOA: 6/7/25, MoState JG

What could lead to a serious conflict in the Arctic? A story from nearly
20 years ago might provide some clues. It was a cold autumn and the sea
was rough. Norwegian Coast Guard inspectors were on duty and were far
out to sea, about to board the Russian trawler Electron, as they had
noticed the vessel was not abiding by protocols. What followed next put
Norwegian diplomacy to the test. The Russian fishermen took the
Norwegian inspectors into Russian waters, and were pursued by Norwegian
Coast Guard ships and helicopters. It later emerged that the Norwegian
Naval Special Operations Command had also been mobilised. Could have
ended differently today After delicate diplomatic efforts, Norway
managed to get the Russian authorities to instruct the trawler to
release the Norwegians and hand over Electron's vessel documents. The
Coast Guard is part of the Norwegian defence. To avoid escalating the
conflict, it was crucial that the Russian Northern Fleet was kept out of
the area. "The Electron incident occurred in 2005. If this had happened
in 2024, it\'s not certain it would have ended as well," Andreas
Østhagen says. He is a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute (FNI). He studies Arctic geopolitics, seeking to identify
factors that could lead to dangerous security flare ups in the Arctic.
Everything that could have gone wrong "When thinking about potential
conflict in the North, it\'s precisely a scenario like the Electron case
that could spiral out of control," Østhagen says. What would have
happened if the fishery inspectors were armed? What if the weather had
been good enough for the marines to board the ship? What if the admirals
of the Russian Northern Fleet were not interested in de-escalation? Many
things could have gone wrong, contributing to an escalation of the
conflict rather than keeping the tumult at as low a level as possible.
Østhagen envisions two scenarios for conflict in the North: A low-scale
incident that escalates or a full-blown crisis, which, in that case,
would be linked to something much larger than the Arctic where Russia
plays a key role. He references the situation in Ukraine and the
currenty global instability. "There is no doubt that interest in the
Arctic is increasing, both commercially and in terms of a geopolitical
power play," he says. Geopolitics deals with how a country\'s politics,
history, and society are shaped based on its geography.

**[The situation is calmer than expected]{.underline}** But Østhagen
believes there are three major misconceptions about geopolitics in the
Arctic: The first is the possibility of war in the Arctic. The second is
that there are unresolved borders in the Arctic and that a resource race
is underway. The third is that climate change is the primary catalyst
for all changes in the Arctic region. "The [reality is much
calmer]{.underline}," Østhagen says. "The [Electron case illustrates
well everything that can go wrong. But it also shows why]{.underline}
**[[things usually don't go wrong. There\'s a willingness to
cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Svein Vigeland Rottem says. [He is a
senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Rottem and Østhagen do not agree that the Arctic is
a powder keg and a dangerous place, as recently stated by Lars Saunes,
former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation
NRK. [Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic]{.underline}
Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions in the Arctic are]{.mark} often more
[stable and transparent]{.mark} than many assume]{.underline}.
[**[Conflict is not easily triggered]{.underline}**,
[considering]{.underline}]{.mark} [the vast areas and diverse countries
involved]{.underline}. Østhagen emphasises the **[[enormity of the
Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which [encompasses eight countries, four
million people, and extensive ocean areas. The countries include Russia,
the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.]{.underline} He notes that the
[significant Russian presence]{.underline} -- with almost half of the
Arctic landmass under Russian control -- [influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North]{.underline}. [Iver B. Neumann, a Russia
researcher and director at the FNI, concurs that **the Arctic is [less
likely to witness]{.mark} armed [conflict than other]{.mark} global
[locations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} He believes the primary driver for
military conflict in the Arctic is Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base
for nuclear weapons. "There are three main ways to keep such weapons
mobile: in aircraft, on land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where
such submarines exist, as in Murmansk, there is also significant
military attention. And where there is military attention, there is also
the potential for conflict," he says. Neumann advises caution in
responding to Russia\'s desire for global attention and military
control, stressing the importance of Norway maintaining a cool head,
enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to intimidation. [Myth 2:
Unresolved borders and a race for resources]{.underline} As the Arctic
becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of climate
change, [a common myth suggests a scramble for resources and land in the
North will occur]{.underline}. But Østhagen clarifies that, [unlike in
other parts of the world, [there are almost **no disputes over Arctic
borders**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "All the borders are settled," he
says, noting that [the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was
resolved in 2022.]{.underline} [[Maritime boundaries are key]{.mark} for
resource management and potential conflict]{.underline}. Law of the sea
grants coastal states sovereign rights for resource exploitation in
their economic zones. In the Arctic, [[only one]{.mark} maritime
boundary [remains unresolved]{.mark}. It is [between the USA and
Canada]{.mark} -- two [close allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Østhagen, who
wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, foresees [**no major concerns**
regarding]{.mark} sovereignty or [territorial
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. He believes the [myth persists due to
historical reasons but]{.underline} emphasises that, with all the land
borders settled and just one disputed sea border, [**[Arctic resources
are already distributed]{.mark}** among the eight Arctic
states.]{.underline} [Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the
Arctic [A]{.mark} third [myth suggests]{.mark} that [climate change is
the]{.mark} main [driver]{.mark} for all political shifts in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [But Østhagen **[caution]{.mark}**s [against
oversimplifying]{.mark} the issue]{.underline}, noting that while
climate change does affect fish migration -- leading to potential future
conflicts around resource-rich areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to
be specific about which aspects of climate change increase conflict
risks. Another claim Østhagen addresses is [the notion that Russia's
military buildup in the Arctic is climate change-driven]{.underline}. He
suggests that this [is only partially true]{.underline}, as Russia is
generally strengthening its military. The Arctic, traditionally seen as
secure due to inaccessibility and ice cover, hosts many of Russia's
nuclear weapons. "Putin's aim to rebuild Russia as a military
superpower, with credible nuclear deterrence, involves deploying weapons
to strategic locations like the Kola Peninsula," Østhagen says. With
climate changes, increased shipping activity in Russian Arctic waters
becomes more feasible. "Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that
Russia wants to maintain control over its northern territories," the
researcher says. However, according to Østhagen, [[Russia's military
buildup]{.mark} in the region [is more about]{.mark} relations with
[NATO than]{.mark} the changing [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

// ***mosuQ***\] \*brackets inserted to clarify that "STWM" =
steps-to-war model

[Our research has applied the **three main indicators** of **STWM
\[steps-to-war model\]** to the Arctic region with regard to the Arctic
Council states in the period since 2014.]{.underline} We have sought to
answer whether the conflict potential has been trending upwards since
2014 and how close it is to a critical threshold based on recent
developments. The outcomes show clear evidence confirming rising
confrontational behaviour in the militarisation marker. On the other
hand, [the **rivalry** indicator shows continued **cooperative
behaviour**, while the coalition-building analysis also shows a mostly
cooperative approach in the post-Crimea period, then a sharp **decline**
after February 2022.]{.underline}

[Thus, [the]{.mark} STWM [\[steps-to-war model\],]{.mark} as [one of the
**most sensitive models of escalation potential** of territorial
disputes]{.mark}, confirms confrontational behaviour in two indicators,
militarisation and coalition- building. The latter, however, changed
**dramatically** after February 2022. Regional Arctic coalitions have
suspended most forms of cooperation with Russia, and two of the regional
actors, Finland and Sweden, applied for NATO membership in May 2022 with
Finland joining in April 2023 and Sweden's membership awaiting Turkish
ratification as of November 2023. Since **[all three
indicators]{.mark}** of the STWM \[steps-to-war model\] [**must**
show]{.mark} the relevant [trends in order to signal]{.mark} increased
[likelihood of]{.mark} international [armed conflict, in the case of the
Arctic]{.mark}, such **[conflict is not
predicted]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Thus, while the research clearly shows a rise in conflict potential,
[critically, [the rivalry factor has **not increased**]{.mark}. In other
words, [**none** of the actors]{.mark} in the examined region
[has]{.mark} an **[interest in escalating confrontational
behaviour]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While the military presence is growing
in the Arctic, this growth has not diverged drastically from the
previous trend. [[Even on the **worsened** geopolitical playing
field]{.mark} after February 2022, **[communication]{.mark}** channels
[have not been interrupted]{.mark}, and the [rivalry indicators clearly
show **cooperative** behaviour]{.mark} among the actors,
[including]{.mark} indications of **[efforts to continue]{.mark}** in
this manner.]{.underline}

Since 2014, defence spending has risen. There have been frequent
rhetorical confrontations, and the undisputable military build-up by
Russia and the other Arctic states has increased. Overall, international
tensions have risen. [Nevertheless, the [actors in the Arctic have shown
**stability** and adherence to]{.mark} the regime of **[regional
coop]{.mark}eration** institutions and treaties. On the other hand, one
might argue that **increased militarisation**, which takes the most time
of all factors and requires the most investment to change, may indicate
that the other factors in STWM \[steps-to-war model\] could also change
easily and quickly. This is confirmed by a rapid change in
coalition-building after February 2022. However, the evidence so far
leaves [the **non-escalating** rivalry factor]{.mark} as [a highly
relevant **counterbalance**]{.mark} to **increased militarisation** and
negative trends in coalition-building. In short, the rivalry factor is
[strong enough to **offset** and even **detract** from the tensions
caused by developments in **militarisation**]{.mark} and
coalition-building.]{.underline}

Placing this research within a larger international context, [the
prioritisation of the Arctic among the key players has decreased at the
expense of developments in Eastern Europe and the world energy
crisis.]{.underline} [The enduring world economic crisis in the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic and [the **invasion of Ukraine** reduces the
desire for an **escalation** of another conflict in the Arctic]{.mark}.
It is thus [expect]{.mark}ed that the [Arctic countries will]{.mark}
adhere to **non-confrontational behaviour**.]{.underline} It is also
questionable whether these countries can sustain their planned
Arctic-specific military spending under the current economic situation
and more pressing issues elsewhere on the international scene. [Hence,
all these phenomena further support the idea that the rivalry factor
will [continue to support **non-escalation**]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline}

The evidence also reveals Russian activities as the catalyst of recent
military developments, and that confrontational behaviour in the
military dimension pits Russia against the other seven Arctic countries.
In this regard, further research as to if and under what conditions the
Arctic could be a future sphere of new Russian military activities would
be valuable. Russian interests in the Arctic, its military developments
after 2014, and the actual reasons for these activities are key topics
for further debate. Yet, despite the clearly increased tensions between
Russia and the West since 2014, we have seen persistent rhetoric
underlining cooperation and joint dispute settlement in the High North
and agendas setting cooperative goals for respective coalitions. Thus,
[the coalition regime under which **cooperation** in [the
**Arctic**]{.mark} takes place [appears **stable**]{.mark} for the time
being.]{.underline}

*The process of accidental war*

[[There is a]{.underline} **[divide]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the process of [[accidental war]{.mark}
assumed [in]{.mark}]{.underline} game-theoretic
[**[models]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
process]{.underline} of accidental war as [discussed in]{.underline}
much of the **[[lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}** on crisis management.
The game-theoretic mechanism of a move by Nature that takes you to war
is the core of this distinction between the two. It means that war does
not result from decisions to go to war, it results from chance, as
represented in Figure 3. [The]{.underline} **[[central]{.mark}
element]{.underline}** [[is that something]{.underline}
**[inadvertent]{.underline}**]{.mark}---an accident, mistaken warning,
or some unauthorized action---[happens]{.underline}, [which [results
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [This
happens]{.underline} [**[purely]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[chance]{.underline}**, **[without]{.underline}**]{.mark} any
**[[choice]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on the part of decision
makers]{.underline}. Leaders might have chosen to take escalatory steps
that increased the likelihood that events spiraled out of control, such
as in Powell's (1990) model of brinkmanship, but this could only occur
before the accident because an actual decision to go to war is
irrational. **[[No war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [occurred in this
manner]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [so]{.underline}]{.mark} [there
are]{.underline} **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** empirical
**[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [correspond]{.mark} to this
model]{.underline}.

[This stands [in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[stark contrast]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the process]{.underline} of accidental war
usually [laid out in [discussions]{.mark}]{.underline} of crisis
management, as illustrated in Figure 4. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
process **[[adds]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a step between the]{.underline}
inadvertent [event and war]{.underline}: [[the]{.underline} **[leader's
choice]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to go to war]{.underline}. For example,
in each of the three American Indian Wars that he identifies as
accidental, Szarejko (2021) describes how leaders chose to fight
following some inadvertent action. Similarly, concerns about launch on
warning nuclear command and control systems are centered on the idea
that false warnings might lead to a decision to launch a nuclear strike
against the enemy, which in turn would lead to war. Unlike the model
outlined in Figure 3, a few wars have occurred following the dynamics
highlighted in Figure 4. Probably the best example is the
Spanish--American War, with the explosion of the USS *Maine* providing
the accidental trigger to the crisis that resulted in the decisions by
the United States and Spain to go to war.

\[FIGURE EXCLUDED\]

[The fact that war results]{.underline} here [from leaders' choices
would]{.underline} seem to [indicate that]{.underline}
[**[no]{.underline}** [war is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[truly
[accidental]{.mark}]{.underline}** or inadvertent, even from accidental
war advocates' own perspective. After all, if war results from choices,
not from chance, then it isn't accidental or inadvertent, as discussed
earlier. Further, **[[mistaken warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [seems to
be at the]{.underline} **[core]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} many
[concerns]{.underline} about accidental nuclear war (Blair, 1993, 1994;
Feaver, 1992, 1994; Sagan, 1993, 1994; Thayer, 1994), [but
this]{.underline} really [[seems to be]{.mark} an argument
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} the danger created by **[[incomplete
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}**. For example, [Utgoff]{.underline}
(1985: 126) [suggests]{.underline} on-site **[monitoring]{.underline}**
[as a way]{.underline} "[for]{.underline} **[reducing]{.underline}**
[the probability]{.underline} of accidental nuclear war."
[[The]{.underline} **[only way]{.underline}** [for monitoring to
affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark} of war
[[is]{.mark} through [making]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} available to decision makers **[more
[complete]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Info]{.mark}rmation revelation [can
affect the likelihood]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[choose]{.mark} to go to
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} it [**[will
not]{.underline}** [affect]{.underline}]{.mark} [the probability
that]{.underline} a [[war]{.mark} results [from]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[chance]{.underline}**]{.mark} rather than choice.

[[Incomplete info]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[well
known]{.underline}** as a cause of war (Fearon, 1995), [and]{.underline}
it is [**[already]{.underline}** [accounted for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} game-theoretic models of deterrence, including ones
that feature accidental war as a mechanism (e.g. Powell, 1990) and
[models that]{.underline} **[do not allow]{.underline}** [accidental
war]{.underline} (e.g. Zagare and Kilgour, 2000). While incomplete
information can certainly make the difference between peace and war, a
war that results from deliberate decision-making, even in the face of
uncertainty or incomplete information, is not accidental or inadvertent.
[Thus]{.underline}, [[both]{.underline} **[logic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence contradict]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
notion of [[accidental war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, even if it is universally accepted that accidental or
inadvertent wars have never happened---a very unlikely prospect---that
would not be enough to convince some that they have overstated the risk
of inadvertent nuclear war. For example, Sagan (1993: 263) argues that
"prenuclear history is a very poor guide in this matter. Not only should
one worry more about rare events when nuclear weapons are involved; but
the nuclear weapons arsenals we have created appear to have themselves
increased the likelihood of accidental war."

*Why the focus on accidental war?*

So why do [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to talk about the
possibility of accidental or inadvertent war even in the face of logic
and evidence against it? Trachtenberg (2000: 23) argues that the crucial
reason is not because these scholars are dishonest or stupid, it is that
"people [**[want]{.underline}** [to believe]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[the military]{.mark}]{.underline} system [[can]{.mark} be
a]{.underline} **[major [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}." They want to believe that rigid war plans,
renegade military officers, and/or the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack all pose serious threats to the prospects for peace.

**[[The]{.mark}re is a venerable [arg]{.mark}ument [that states]{.mark}
can [stumble]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[into]{.underline}**]{.mark} a
**[[major conflict]{.mark} that neither truly desires]{.underline}**,
and it has been revived **[as]{.underline}** **[tensions]{.underline}**
between the two great powers **[escalate]{.underline}**.
**[Nevertheless, [history shows]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[big wars
[don\'t]{.mark} just [happen]{.mark} inadvertently]{.underline}**. 

The accidental war thesis
was [[raised]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-03/beware-guns-august-asia?utm_medium=social) recently
by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia. **[Noting the many
flashpoints at which U.S. and Chinese interests collide, he argued that
there is a growing danger of them "stumbling into
conflict."]{.underline}** An accidental collision between ships or
planes in the South China Sea, or several other plausible scenarios,
could lead to crisis, escalation and war. **[Just as the great powers of
the early 20th century
"[sleep-walked](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepwalkers-How-Europe-Went-1914/dp/0061146668)"
into World War I, China and America could blunder their way to disaster
today. ]{.underline}**

**[World War I is
often [considered](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepwalkers-How-Europe-Went-1914/dp/0061146668) the [classic](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-August-Pulitzer-Prize-Winning-Outbreak/dp/0345476093) example
of an unwanted war]{.underline}**: a devastating conflict that none of
the participants would have chosen had they known what was coming.
During the Cold War, U.S. policymakers worried that crises over Berlin
or Cuba could get out of control. There is a body
of [[political]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/Arms-Influence-Preface-Afterword-Lectures/dp/0300143370) [[science]{.underline}](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cs1J3h_28AUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=accidental+war&ots=Vfdc3HCKxi&sig=gh8pOSz58LDIvtAAUn--95sVb2E#v=onepage&q=accidental%20war&f=false) [[literature]{.underline}](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nveiS7HeqQUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=inadvertent+escalation&ots=GqOsJAq4dp&sig=6basMxSMJtCAc4RgaXD2dQzd4fM#v=onepage&q=inadvertent%20escalation&f=false) devoted
to understanding how accidental war can occur.

**[Yet]{.underline}** there is one big problem: **[[It is hard to
identify]{.mark} any [major wars that came]{.mark} about [even though no
one wanted them]{.mark}. The trouble [in]{.mark} July and August [1914,
it]{.mark} turns out,
[was [not](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538909?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)]{.mark} that
[inflexible]{.mark} mobilization]{.underline}** schedules
**[and]{.underline}** **[military [plans]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[thrust]{.underline}** political **[leaders into conflict. It was that

most notably
but [[not]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/July-1914-Countdown-Sean-McMeekin/dp/0465060749) solely
Austria-Hungary and Imperial Germany, **[[insisted]{.mark} on pursuing
[aggressive policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that [they knew
risked]{.mark}]{.underline}** a localized war at best and a
**[continental [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** at worst. **[They nearly
all [believed](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ISEC_a_00173#.VCBM_RYXOVo),
moreover, that if war had to come, better it should come sooner rather
than later.]{.underline}**

A generation after that, **[Franklin Roosevelt may not have foreseen
that slapping an oil embargo on Japan would lead to the aerial assault
on Pearl Harbor. But he certainly understood that war was a distinct
possibility]{.underline}** **[once the U.S. began strangling the economy
of a country that was already pillaging Asia.]{.underline}**

**[Likewise, the Six Day sWar]{.underline}** of 1967 **[is
sometimes [treated](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Avoiding_War/RMtmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=alexander+george+avoiding+war&dq=alexander+george+avoiding+war&printsec=frontcover) as]{.underline}**
an **[inadvertent]{.underline}** conflict. **[But again, Egyptian
leaders were hardly blind to
the [danger](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Six_Days_of_War/lEklDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=michael+oren+six+days+of+war&printsec=frontcover) of
war when they mobilized forces in the Sinai Peninsula, blockaded
Israel's port on the Red Sea and took other belligerent
steps. ]{.underline}**

The reality, as the historian Marc Trachtenberg
has [[shown]{.underline}](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/cv/inadvertent.pdf),
is that **[countries tend to avoid war when neither really desires it.
Yes, leaders do sometimes misjudge]{.underline}** how wars will turn out
and how destructive they will be. **[Tensions can gradually ratchet up
in a way that makes de-escalation progressively harder.]{.underline}**

**[Yet [there is no more monumental decision than]{.mark} to initiate a
[major conflict. So when countries really]{.mark} do [want to
avert]{.mark} a [showdown]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are generally willing
to [tack or retreat]{.mark}, even at the cost of some
embarrassment. ]{.underline}**

**[[During the Cold War]{.mark}, there was plenty of superpower
brinkmanship]{.underline}**, and some hair-raising incidents involving
U.S. and Soviet military forces. There
were [[several]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/We-Now-Know-Rethinking-Relations/dp/0198780710) near
misses in the Cuban Missile Crisis alone. **[But]{.underline}**
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that]{.underline}** case
**[and]{.underline}** **[[every]{.mark} other
[case]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[the [crisis was
defused]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and the superpowers drew back,
precisely]{.underline}** **[because]{.underline}** **[they didn't
believe that the stakes merited a nuclear bloodbath.]{.underline}**

**[Accidental war also seems unlikely today]{.underline}**. **[There are
plenty of circumstances in which [the U.S. and China could find
themselves in]{.mark} a crisis:]{.underline}** a replay of the [[EP-3
incident]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/02/world/us-plane-in-china-after-it-collides-with-chinese-jet.html) of

[[If arms control is needed]{.underline}]{.mark} in a strategic
relationship [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} in question [[might go to war, it will be
**impractical**]{.mark} for that very reason of
**need**]{.underline}---[whereas]{.underline}, [[if arms control should
prove]{.mark} to be [**available**, it will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[[be **irrelevant**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This has been called [the
**arms control paradox**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The record of the Cold
War shows that both the so-called status quo and revisionist powers,
[the US and]{.underline} the [Soviet Union]{.underline} respectively,
[were]{.underline} more or less [equally responsible for
reneging]{.underline} on their [arms control promises]{.underline}.

[Not only did both]{.underline} of them [attempt to **gain** nuclear
**superiority**]{.underline} during the Cold War despite a plethora of
arms control agreements, but [they were also equally responsible for
**encouraging prolif**]{.underline}eration. As the great powers try to
maximize their share of world power, [their **[interests
inevitably]{.mark}** come into [**conflict** with **arms
control**]{.mark}]{.underline} agreements, [making]{.underline} such
[[agreements **unravel**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While one can give some credit to arms control for maintaining strategic
stability and creating norms of behaviour, the fact remains that
[even]{.underline} one of [the **most in-depth agreements**
in]{.underline} terms of details of [provisions]{.underline},
[verification measures]{.underline}, and leading to regime
strengthening, the **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**omprehensive
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**est **[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**an
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, [[was rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}
by the US even when it faced no great power as a rival in the near term.
This is significant because [[if even]{.mark} one of [the
strongest]{.mark} arms control [measures is not]{.mark} deemed
[worthy]{.mark} of acceptance]{.underline}, then [[there is]{.mark}
**some [problem]{.mark}** [with **the** ]{.mark}**very [idea]{.mark}**
[of **arms control** rather than]{.mark} **[its]{.mark} specific
[provisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Indeed, [disenchantment with arms control has been growing since
the]{.underline} 19[80s]{.underline}. After a brief period of détente in
the 1970s, the two superpowers again started treating each other as
antagonists. [This affected **all**]{.underline} the **[arms
control]{.underline}** measures agreed to during détente. The signing of
a plethora of arms control agreements during détente was seen as a
success of arms control rather than a reflection of the relaxation of
tensions during détente. And so, when after détente, the superpowers
gave arms control short shrift, there was a lot of disappointment.

[[Major powers]{.underline}]{.mark} have **[always
[viewed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}
measures [[as a **by-product** of **underlying**]{.mark} **political
[realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is enough evidence to suggest
that [while great power [attempts]{.mark} at arms control [have **at
best** been]{.mark} quite **[useless]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} [have deftly used]{.underline} various [arms
control]{.underline} provisions [to **constrain**]{.underline} the
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}** [of **other states**]{.underline}
in the international system.

Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State
University. "US Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence", Air and Space Power

Realists in this regard are from Missouri, the "show me" state, and ask
utopians to explain how, why, and when a powerful new cooperative
international norm with corresponding international institutions will
become a reality. [[Realists point to]{.mark} **the unhappy history** of
the **unmet claims** and [**dashed hopes** of]{.mark} **the 1928
[Kellogg-Briand]{.mark} Pact**]{.underline} (intended to prevent
offensive war by global legal agreement), [**the [League of
Nations]{.mark}**[, and the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations. To be sure, the future does not have
to be bound by the past, but before moving further toward nuclear
disarmament, realists want to see some clear evidence of the emerging
transformation of the global order---not just the claim that it can
occur if all key leaders are so willing, faithful, and visionary and can
"embrace a politics of impossibility."12 As the old English proverb
says, ["If wishes were **horses**, then beggars would
**ride**."]{.underline}

But has not everything changed in the twenty-first century? Has not the
end of the Cold War ushered in a new global commitment to cooperation,
the rule of law globally, and benign conflict resolution? The unarguable
answer is no. **[Russian military [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[against **Georgia**]{.mark} **in 2008** [and **Ukraine**]{.mark}
**since 2014**]{.underline} (the latter in direct violation of the 1994
Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, Great Britain, and the United
States) [[are **sufficient**]{.mark} **empirical evidence** [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Thucydides']{.mark} **stark
description of [reality]{.mark}** [is **alive**]{.mark} **and well**.
[China's]{.mark} **expansionist [claims]{.mark}** and **military
pressure**]{.underline} against its neighbors in the East and South
China Seas [[teach the same lesson]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why is this reality significant in the consideration of nuclear weapons?
Because in the absence of reliably overturning the powerful norm of
raison d'État and Thucydides' explanation of international relations,
states with the capability and felt need will continue to demand nuclear
capabilities for their own protection and, in some cases, to provide
cover for their expansionist plans. To wit, if Ukraine had retained
nuclear weapons, would it now fear for its survival at the hands of
Russian aggression? Former Ukrainian defense minister Valeriy Heletey
and members of the Ukrainian parliament have made this point explicitly,
lamenting Ukraine's transfer of its nuclear forces to Russia in return
for now-broken security promises of the Budapest Memorandum.13

This lesson cannot have been lost on other leaders considering the value
of nuclear weapons. Nor is it a coincidence that US allies in Central
Europe and Asia are becoming ever more explicit about their need for US
nuclear assurances under the US extended nuclear deterrent (i.e., the
nuclear umbrella). They see no new emerging, powerful global collective
security regime or cooperative norms that will preserve their security;
thus, they understandably seek the assurance of power, including nuclear
power. The Polish Foreign Ministry observed in a recent press release
that "the current situation reaffirms the importance of NATO's nuclear
deterrence policy."14 This [[reality]{.mark} stands in **stark
[contrast]{.mark}** [to **utopian claims**]{.mark} that **powerful new
global [norms]{.mark}** and **international institutions** [will
**reorder** the]{.mark} international [system]{.mark}, **overturn**
Thucydides]{.underline}, and allow individual states to dispense with
nuclear weapons or the nuclear protection of a powerful ally. As the
Socialist French president Francois Hollande has said, "The
international context does not allow for any weakness. . . . The era of
nuclear deterrence is therefore not over. . . . In a dangerous
world---and it is dangerous---France does not want to let down its
guard. . . . The possibility of future state conflicts concerning us
directly or indirectly cannot be excluded."15 There could be no clearer
expression of Thucydides' description of international relations and its
contemporary implications for nuclear weapons.

Opponents of the administration's plan to modernize the US triad now
double down on the utopian narrative by insisting that the United States
instead lead the way in establishing the new global norm by showing that
Washington no longer relies on nuclear weapons and does not seek new
ones. Washington cannot expect others to forgo nuclear weapons if it
retains them, they say, and thus it must lead in creation of the new
norm against nuclear weapons by providing an example to the world. For
instance, "by unilaterally reducing its arsenal to a total of 1,000
warheads, the United States would encourage Russia to similarly reduce
its nuclear forces without waiting for arms control negotiations."16 A
good US example supposedly can help "induce parallel" behavior in
others.17 If, however, the United States attributes continuing value to
nuclear weapons by maintaining its arsenal, "other countries will be
more inclined to seek" them.18

Nuclear realists respond, however, that the United States already has
reduced its nuclear forces deeply over the last 25 years. America cut
its tactical nuclear weapons from a few thousand in 1991 to a "few
hundred" today.19 Moreover, US-deployed strategic nuclear weapons have
been cut from an estimated 9,000 in 1992 to roughly 1,600 accountable
warheads today, with still more reductions planned under the New START
Treaty.20 The United States has even decided to be highly revealing of
its nuclear capabilities to encourage others to do so, with no apparent
effect on Russia, China, or North Korea.21 America has adhered fully to
the reductions and restrictions of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty---the "centerpiece of arms control"---but the Russians now
are in open violation. As former undersec- retary of state Robert Joseph
stated recently, decades of deep US reductions "appear to have had no
moderating effect on Russian, Chinese or North Korean nuclear programs.
Neither have U.S. reductions led to any effective strengthening of
international nonproliferation efforts."22 [[Utopians want]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
lead]{.underline}]{.mark} the world toward nuclear disarmament
[[by]{.mark} **its good [example]{.mark}**[, but **no one** is
following]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[The]{.mark} basic [reason]{.mark}]{.underline}**, realists point
out, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**foreign [leaders]{.mark}** [make
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} about nuclear weaponry
[[based]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} their
countries' **[[strategic needs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, raison d'État,
[[not]{.mark} in **deference** to **[America's
penchant]{.mark}**]{.underline} for nuclear disarmament or some sense of
global fairness. A close review of India by S. Paul Kapur, for example,
concluded that "Indian leaders do not seek to emulate US nuclear
behavior; they formulate policy based primarily on their assessment of
the security threats facing India."23 The same self-interested
calculation is true for other nuclear and aspiring nuclear states.

US air]{.mark}]{.underline} [defense [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
fighter aircraft]{.underline} (Military Watch, 2018). So, my sense is
that [Russia's heavy bombers]{.underline} have comparable survivability
to the US's stealthy strategic bombers. Like the US air-based nuclear
forces, Russia's is vulnerable at a few 'choke points' --- before take
off, mid-attack, and during refueling and repair ---
but [is]{.underline} [overall very
survivable. [While]{.mark}]{.underline}, as I described
above, [[radar and]{.mark} other [tech]{.mark}nologies [are improving]{.mark}, Russia's heavy [bombers will]{.mark} likely [remain]{.mark} relatively [survivable]{.mark}]{.underline} for
the time being.

This in mind, I expect some fraction of Russian heavy bombers to be
destroyed during a counterforce attack, but I believe many or [most
would remain unscathed.]{.underline} I guess that [somewhere between 60%
and 100%]{.underline} (280 and 470) [of Russia air-based nuclear
warheads would survive a first strike.]{.underline}\[16\]

Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)

Within the ICBM leg of the triad, deployed ICBMs can be further broken
down into: silo-based ICBMs, which both the US and Russia have, and
"road-mobile" ICBMs, which only Russia has.

Like the US's land-based nuclear forces, Russia's silo-based ICBMs would
be vulnerable to attack. Also, like the US's land-based forces,
super-hardened silos would make the destruction of 100% of Russia's
silo-based nuclear weapons extremely costly, but improvements in US
technology mean the US could get reasonably close (Lieber & Press,
2017a; McKinzie, eds. 2001). For example, the accuracy of US long-range
ballistic missiles has improved dramatically since the end of the Cold
War as a result of substantial progress in submarine geolocation and
missile guidance systems. Whereas in 1985 US SLBMs had only a 9% change
of effectively destroying a hardened silo, today that chance has
increased to 90% (Lieber & Press, 2017b, p. 3).

[[Russia's]{.mark} road-mobile land-based [ICBMs]{.mark} have the
additional tactical challenge of being 'relocatable.]{.underline}'
Through bilateral arms control treaties, Russia has shared the
coordinates of locations associated with a number of mobile ICBMs
(associated garrisons, parking sites, etc.) (McKinzie, eds. 2001). The
US also has intelligence on the dispersal patterns of road-mobile ICBMs,
satellite imaging that's high-resolution enough to see road-mobile ICBMs
(as long as they aren't in underground tunnels), and the ability to
monitor communications between road-mobile missiles (McKinzie, eds.
2001; Lieber & Press, 2017a).

According to McKinzie et al., road-mobile missiles are kept stationary
at garrisons and parking sites periodically (2001). Many of them would
only 'disperse' after a first strike early warning. Any road-mobile
missiles still in the garrisons by the time a first strike arrived would
be destroyed with relative ease. One to two 300kt nuclear warheads
allocated per garrison known to be sheltering road-mobile ICBMs would
yield a high probability of successfully destroying the missile systems
positioned there (McKinzie et al., 2001).

What's more, the launch sites that would be used by Russia's mobile
missiles are both relatively easy to identify and easy to target,
meaning the US would have some success destroying road-mobile missiles
even after they'd dispersed (McKinzie et al., 2001).

But [road-mobile missiles that have been mobilized and aren't positioned
at a launch site would be much harder to target]{.underline}, and in
fact, used to be [considered]{.underline} ["inherently
survivable"]{.underline} (see a discussion of the general consensus
about this in Long & Green, 2014; McKinzie, eds. 2001, 54). According to
Long and Green, "In particular, [mobile nuclear weapons]{.underline} ---
'relocatable targets' in the common parlance
--- [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [now generally viewed
as]{.underline} [[untargetable]{.mark} in a first
strike]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} [[secure]{.underline} [second
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}[ has
therefore]{.underline} [[become]{.underline}]{.mark} [almost]{.underline} [[synonymous]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
state possessing]{.underline} significant numbers of \[SLBMs\]
and/or [[mobile]{.underline}]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([[ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark})" (2014, p. 40).

Once located, road-mobile missiles are easier to destroy, even while
moving, as they have weaker defenses than silo-based missile systems
(Long & Green, 2014; Acton, 2010). In fact, a nuclear bomb wouldn't have
to detonate particularly close a road-mobile target to it to destroy it.
For example, a 100kt ICBM detonated in the air would damage a
road-mobile missile system anywhere within an area of 26 square
kilometers (McKinzie, eds. 2001). And if the bomb detonated is big
enough, the road-mobile missile system wouldn't be able to drive outside
the radius of the detonation quickly enough to escape the blast, even
with early warnings.

According to Long and Green (2014), improvements in technology, in
particular by the US, is getting closer to being able to locate
road-mobile ICBMs.\[17\] Modern sensors now take advantage of techniques
like spectroscopy and interferometry, among others, allowing them to,
for example, detect vapors that leak out of missile silos and trucks
from a distance (Lieber & Press, 2017). Similarly, remotely piloted
vehicles like drones will be able to monitor the movement of
mobile-ICBMs, allowing the US to finally track mobile-ICBMs over time
after they've been identified (Lieber & Press, 2017).

But according to James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program
and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
"[[locating]{.mark} mobile [ballistic missiles is exceptionally
hard]{.mark}," and [even]{.mark}
taking [improvements in US tech]{.mark}nology into account, "it is
[still]{.mark} fiendishly [difficult to locate]{.mark} mobile
[missiles]{.mark} hidden by a well-prepared enemy"]{.underline} (Acton,
2010). We\'re just not at the point where we can reliably detect and
track road-mobile nuclear forces.

Taken together, I expect that --- assuming Russia didn't launch on
warning --- between 75% and 99% (340--440) of Russia's silo-based ICBMs
and between 10% and 50%, or (30--120) of its road-mobile ICBMs would be
destroyed in a US first strike.

Russia's Missile Defense Systems

According to CSIS Missile Defense Project,
\"[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [now]{.underline} [[possesses]{.underline}]{.mark} [some
of]{.underline} [[the]{.underline} [most advanced air and missile
defense]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
world]{.underline}" with missile defense systems across the country,
and **[68 nuclear-armed interceptors]{.underline}** are located
surrounding Moscow (2018; Secretary of Defense, 2019). To date, [the
defense systems have been limited to destroying aircraft, drones, cruise
missiles, and short- to intermediate-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline}, but [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [arrival of
Russia's]{.underline} [[newest surface-to-air
missile]{.underline}]{.mark} (the S-500) in 2020 [may allow it
to]{.underline} [[target US ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ritzen,
2018; CSIS).\[18\]

But my impression is that these systems are intended to protect the
capitol --- not necessarily to protect Russia's nuclear arsenal. I
therefore don't expect them to have any meaningful impact on the
survivability of its nuclear arsenal.

Surviving a US first strike

Taken together, I expect that Russia's nuclear forces would likely fare
a bit worse than the US's during a first strike. If we assume that
Russia's deployed nuclear forces are distributed across the three legs
of its triad in proportion to the distribution of its strategic
warheads[,]{.underline} [[Russia could be left
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [up
to]{.underline} [[1,240]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear]{.underline} [[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} [after
a first strike]{.underline}. Realistically though, I expect it would be
far fewer --- [perhaps as few as 450]{.underline}.[ In either
case]{.underline}, [Russia would still be able to
mount]{.underline} [a formidable second strike\[19\].]{.underline}

Like above, my conclusions could be quite different if it turned out
either the US or Russia were being deceptive about the size,
composition, and capabilities of their nuclear arsenals or missile
defense systems. While I think it's relatively less likely that the US
would execute a cyberattack to augment a first strike against Russia,
cyberattacks and other unknowns add to my uncertainty.

Conclusion

For now, [it seems like]{.underline} [[neither the US nor Russia
would]{.underline}]{.mark} [likely]{.underline} [[be able to execute a
'perfect' counterforce strike]{.underline},]{.mark} making it unlikely
for either to put an immediate end to the nuclear exchange.
Uncertainties about deception, cyberattacks, and other unknowns, I
expect that [between \~990 and \~1,500 of the US's deployed nuclear
warheads and between \~450 and\~1,240 of Russia's deployed nuclear
warheads would survive a first strike]{.underline}. However,
improvements in technology could substantially threaten the
survivability of deployment systems that have been considered
'inherently survivable' for decades.

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Russia / Arctic War\-\--AT: Ambiguity \[Heier Extension\]

#### Heier's analysis [accounted]{.underline} for [ambiguity]{.underline}\-\--it [creates]{.underline} [restraint]{.underline}. 

**Heier '25** \[Tormod Heier, Professor of military strategy and
operations at the University of the Inland; Associate Professor at the
National Defence University in Stockholm; 32 years as an officer in the
Norwegian Armed Forces, 15 of which were as a Lieutenant Colonel in the
Army. February 2025. *Arctic Review on Law and Politics*, Vol. 16, p. 58
"How the Ukraine War Stopped Arctic Brinkmanship" // ***mosuQ***\]

A theoretical mechanism for avoiding war is therefore subtle
salami-tactics; a course of action where protagonists are engaged
incrementally -- over months or years inside the same operational
theater. The point is to create "a new normal". [**[Ambiguity]{.mark}**,
therefore, [is a **central characteristic**]{.mark}, largely [due
to]{.mark} "[the]{.mark} plain [**impossibility** of defining]{.mark}
\[any adequate [responses]{.mark}\] [in **exact detail**]{.mark}. There
are areas of doubt even in the most carefully drafted statuses and
contacts"]{.underline}.4 [[Unexpected force deployments, snap
exercises]{.mark}, and also transparent maneuvers [have]{.mark} thus
[one aim: to carefully **probe rival responses**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
If responses are tardy or lenient, the protagonist is incentivized to
push the limit one more step. But if reactions are assertive, offensive
or even aggressive, your own code of conduct should be tempered.5
[**[Restraints]{.mark}** or reassurances [are thereby imposed
within]{.mark} your [chain of command to **move away from the brink of
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the salami-tactic's core are efforts to
gain advantageous outcomes by taking calculated risks against the
adversary's core interests. The goal is to make the opponent's military
force back off, scale down, or preferably, leave the entire operational
area.6

The avenues are thus manifold and complimentary. Assertive action may be
diplomatic communication through secret backchannels, narratives
published in global media, or military signaling with a tailored posture
in the contested area. The message is nevertheless the same: a hard-core
realist intention to communicate resolve and willingness to use extreme
methods rather than concede to opponents' coercion. As pointed out by
Schelling, we want to change his behavior, but in a way "where he is not
going to do something".7

However, as Richard Ned Lebow (1941--) points out, brinkmanship is a
perilous stratagem. As protagonists seek to impose threats with
potentially catastrophic nuclear consequences, numerous risks may arise.
Examples are fear, repression, anxiety, and disintegrating coping
mechanisms inside your opponent's chain of command.8 This may easily
happen,

\[...\] during the most acute stages of an international crisis;
critical junctures when decision for peace or war hangs in the balance.
A breakdown in the policy maker's defenses may result in erratic
behavior, paranoia, or paralysis.9

The brinkmanship theory therefore prescribes a plausible relationship
between restraint and non-violent outcomes. As pointed out by Lebow, a
key explanatory mechanism is to enforce a trade-off between the
belligerents.10 [[Neither]{.mark} of the [partie]{.mark}s [has]{.mark} a
strong [interest in pushing their rival **over the
brink**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Both]{.mark} parties [acknowledge their
**mutual destiny**]{.mark} inside the ambiguously gray zone between
peace and war, a strategic environment of **mutual deterrence** and
denial but also prospects for benevolent signaling or even **silent
cooperation through restraints**]{.underline}. [[Gradually]{.mark}
therefore, [a]{.mark} theoretical [mechanism of **crisis stability tends
to arise**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a situation where
[[both]{.mark} parties are [tied together by a unifying interest in
respecting each other's "back yards",]{.mark} spheres of interest, or
areas of operations, i.e. [by **avoiding**]{.mark} **preemptive
[operations, escalatory exercises, or provocative
maneuvers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These are mechanisms put in place so
that **[security margins increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[**Inadvertent wars** are]{.mark} thereby
**[precluded]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, restraints allow
belligerents to buy time because coercion is balanced with efforts to
calm down. As explained in Lebow's Between Peace and War (2020), avenues
for communication must be made available, not least to clarify potential
misperceptions or misunderstandings as "stereotyped interpretations of
dramatic historical events, especially wars and revolutions" unfold.11

## Yes Russia / Arctic War

#### The Arctic is a nuclear [flashpoint]{.underline}\-\--[gray]{.underline} [zone]{.underline}, [navigation]{.underline} issues, and treaty [expiration]{.underline}.

relations, California State University-Long Beach; MA, public diplomacy,

// ***mosuQ***\]

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most. For
decades, cooler heads prevailed, and [the U.S. and Russia worked
cooperatively to reduce the risk of **nuclear conflict** and decrease
the size of their arsenals. By 2022, cooperation began
**disintegrating**]{.underline} as Russia's botched invasion of Ukraine
raised serious concerns about nuclear escalation and severely hampered
the prospects of future nuclear arms control agreements. With Russia
seemingly dismissing the Trump administration's rather conciliatory
efforts to end the war, there appears to be no end in sight, and Europe
is feeling the pressure, embarking on a massive effort to boost its own
defense.

[Amidst these tensions, melting polar ice is opening Arctic sea lanes to
increased shipping traffic, resource exploration, and military
posturing]{.underline}. NATO's newest members, Finland and Sweden, are
Arctic nations. Russia currently dominates the Arctic region, holding
53% of its total coastline, operating the world's biggest icebreaker
fleet, and has been upgrading its Arctic military bases. China is also
increasingly playing a role, conducting joint Arctic military exercises
with Russia and employing an icebreaker fleet of its own, despite its
complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.

But [is [the Arctic **destined** to be the]{.mark} most likely
[**flashpoint** for a **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}? Let's look
at the possibilities.

Despite being so cold, [the Arctic is no stranger to military conflict,
holding major strategic value and serving as a passageway to both the
Atlantic and Pacific]{.underline}. During World War II, the Battle of
the Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war
supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany
invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War
of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for
submarine activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. Greenland's geographic
location, combined with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in
the high north, provides key "missile warning, missile defense, and
space surveillance" capabilities. The shortest flight paths for nuclear
missiles between the U.S. and Russia exist over the Arctic Ocean, and
the loss of this base on account of a diplomatic blunder could open a
key blind spot in America's strategic defense. Alternatively, the loss
of this base to a Russian attack aimed at disabling American missile
detection infrastructure is unlikely due to the danger of immediate
retaliation and escalation.

Currently, [[the most likely path to]{.mark} a potential **[nuclear
exchange]{.mark}** in the Arctic [would be through]{.mark} a
conventional or **["gray zone"]{.mark}** Russian [attack]{.mark} on a
NATO member. Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions,
reckless military intercepts, and support to separatist groups
intentionally sit in the "gray zone" between peace and outright war, but
could [ultimately lead to **open conflict that escalates to nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on
other Greelandic infrastructure, or an information operations campaign
aimed at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of
the realm of possibility.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a 1,343 km border with Russia---there is increased opportunity
that a NATO Arctic state could be attacked. Highlighting this risk,
American forces in Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of
troops were flown to Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion.
Yet rather than an overt invasion of a NATO member, [[**Russia**
is]{.mark} far more **[likely]{.mark}** test the waters by
[conduct]{.mark}ing **[provocative and destabilizing]{.mark} small-scale
[gray zone activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The disastrous results of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about
its ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear
armed country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack
unlikely. It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray zone
activities would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5
collective defense declaration short of a direct attack across the
border.

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment. As a result, France and the UK are
considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance
on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic
NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to decommission
its current warheads as it brings replacements online, potentially
doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an
airbase closer to the German border to be able to host nuclear weapons.
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence, and may seek
other options to assure an effective and reliable deterrent. This could
foretell a new nuclear arms race.

[[The upcoming **February**]{.mark} **2026 [expiration of]{.mark} New
START**, [the last]{.mark} remaining strategic [**nuclear arms treaty**
between the U.S. and Russia]{.mark}, [portends a period]{.mark} of
nuclear proliferation [that]{.mark} could [echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, China, which
has been operating in the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid
nuclear buildup in an effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by
2035. China has consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral
nuclear arms reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its
comparatively much smaller nuclear arsenal.

[[**Navigation issues** in the Arctic could also lead to]{.mark}
**military [escalations]{.mark}** reaching the **nuclear
level**]{.underline}. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
which includes satellite constellations like the American GPS system or
Russian GLONASS, sees decreased reliability and accuracy in the Arctic.
The reasons for this are abundant, like the orbital inclination of the
satellites themselves and ionospheric interference. With increased
incidents of Russian GNSS jamming in Europe, [it's conceivable that
[Russia may **employ similar tactics**]{.mark} **in the Arctic**,
including spoofing, [for the purpose of disruption]{.mark} or causing
navigational errors [to trigger an exploitable international
incident]{.mark}. Military or civilian vessels straying into Russian
territory could be captured, their cargoes seized, or crews held hostage
for the purpose of conducting hostage diplomacy. Resolving [such a
confrontation]{.mark} military [could **quickly spiral out of
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

What is most concerning is that [provocative [military behavior]{.mark}
anywhere could [lead to an **unintentional cycle of escalation** that
ultimately results in]{.mark} a [**nuclear exchange**. As the Arctic
opens to more]{.mark} **military and commercial [activity]{.mark}**[,
the **frequency of encounters**]{.mark} between military forces is
likely to **[increase]{.mark}**. As those encounters increase, [so too
does the **probability** that an accident or]{.mark} unintended
**[attack]{.mark}** may [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Russia routinely
flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, an area
of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all aircraft,
aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a routine
encounter evolving into an international incident. But these aggressive
incidents are much more frequent elsewhere, like the Baltic and North
Seas. For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two
missiles against a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea,
but fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is
known for conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in
the East and South China Seas.

#### Arctic security competition increasing now. Russian militarization, increased Chinese activity, and lack of NATO readiness means high risk of conflict

**Flanagan 2025.** Molly Flanagan Research Intern · The American
Security Project "NATO's Urgent Arctic Defense Strategy: Countering
Russia and Securing Key Resources Amid Rising Geopolitical Tensions"
American Security Project March 14, 2025. \<\> Accessed 6/24/25. ARJSH

In President [Trump's]{.underline} recent speech to Congress, his
reiteration of his [desire to acquire Greenland "one way or the other"
is a reflection of the intensifying strategic competition in the
Arctic.]{.underline} As climate change accelerates, countries are
seeking to exploit the changing landscape, leading to increased
commercial and military activity. Though the area has a history of
contest, [the environment's rapidly melting ice has revealed a wealth of
natural resources and increasingly navigable shipping routes with grand
economic implications]{.underline}. Consequently, in recent years,
[[growing Russian militarization]{.mark} has raised considerable concern
among Arctic states, [heightening tensions as the region becomes
geopolitically more significant]{.mark}, making it more crucial than
ever for NATO countries to strengthen their relationships and develop a
unified defense strategy.]{.underline} During the Cold War, [[the Arctic
became a NATO frontline]{.mark} mainly focused on under-ice submarine
activity and airspace monitoring]{.underline}. [Following the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the region]{.underline} was considered "High North,
Low Tension" and [saw an era of relatively peaceful cooperation. This
period decisively ended with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and
saber-rattling has grown far more direct.]{.underline} Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov recently stated that [[Russia is "fully ready to defend
its interests militarily, politically, and from the standpoint of
defense technologies \[in the Arctic\]."]{.underline}]{.mark} [Following
the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland, [Putin has only grown more
sensitive to fears of "encirclement" by the alliance]{.mark}, possibly
explaining more recent demonstrations of power projection by increased
military aircraft and maritime activity in the area.]{.underline} In the
last two decades, [[Russia has significantly expanded its polar
presence]{.mark}, bolstering its northern security and strategic
position]{.underline}, while benefiting from its ownership of more than
half of the coastline in the region. As part of this, [Russia has
[invested in reopening Soviet-era infrastructure]{.mark} [and
modernizing its military assets]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Furthermore, [[China is expanding its presence there by partnering with
Russia]{.mark} for regional access, declaring itself a "Near-Arctic
State," and [conducting joint polar military exercises that complicate
the security environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic is vital for
economic and resource reasons as well. The Northern Sea Route (NSR)
offers a quicker maritime route between Europe and Asia, and Russia's
control of this increasingly accessible waterway could potentially
disrupt allied commercial or military shipping, challenging freedom of
navigation. Moreover, with significant oil and gas reserves, Russia has
leverage over global energy markets, particularly as Europe remains
dependent on Russian fossil fuels that help fund Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. [[Russia's Arctic activities test NATO's readiness and
capabilities]{.mark} and are part of a broader global strategy, as its
vigilant security efforts provide [stark contrast to the lack of NATO
strategic collective defense in the region]{.mark}. Seven Arctic
territorial claimants are NATO members, counterbalancing Russia's
presence, but the response has been slow and inadequate given these
developments. NATO has acknowledged the developing need for a more
coordinated security strategy]{.underline}, but still greatly lags
behind Russia in its collective defense posture. [[NATO would need at
least 10 years to match Russia's current regional security
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} This latent approach is further
solidified by the fact that [[the]{.mark} [alliance presently has no
formal Arctic policy]{.mark}, underscoring insufficient urgency and
resources dedicated to the region.]{.underline} To swiftly adapt to the
evolving security landscape, NATO must develop a clear strategy to
strengthen the collective defense of its Northern Flank and safeguard
its interests through enhanced infrastructure, expanded patrols, and the
security of critical resources. This includes: Closing the security
infrastructure gap by expanding and enhancing major projects, including
military bases and anti-missile defense systems, as a priority.
Increasing air and naval patrolling in strategically important areas,
like the GIUK gap and the Barents Sea, to monitor and record any
potential growing threats. Securing critical key systems (i.e., undersea
communication cables, pipelines, and shipping routes) to defend its
regional interests. Adopting an official Arctic security policy that
outlines guidance and goals in the region and ensures a unified effort
across member states. As [the warming Arctic is set to become a key
global frontier for geopolitical strategic competition, [Russia's polar
dominance has only grown, while China is now spreading its influence as
an extra-regional actor.]{.mark} The "NATO 7" must enhance efforts to
create a more comprehensive collective defense strategy to secure
members' interests]{.underline} in the region[.]{.underline} Adaptation
to the evolving climate in the High North will require [[proactive
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} between allies, enabling NATO a
robust and unified defense posture that [[addresses]{.underline}]{.mark}
the growing challenges [and [long-term stability in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia's low intensity warfare operations in the Arctic

As a response to the sense of vulnerability in the AZRF, [[Russia is
becoming more confrontational]{.mark} in its approach towards regional
security and [finding excuses to 'defend' itself against perceived
external threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the Kremlin is taking stock
of the consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, [[Russia
will]{.mark} likely [conduct]{.mark} more [conventional power
demonstrations]{.mark}, sub-threshold activities, and grey zone
operations in the Arctic.]{.underline}

While there is little incentive for the Kremlin leadership to escalate
in the region per se, [there is also a strong willingness [to]{.mark}
continue probing and [test]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} resolve of the
Arctic]{.underline} 7 through a well-established toolkit of low
intensity warfare operations. [These sub-threshold operations and [grey
zone]{.mark} activities mostly take the form of:]{.underline}

[Brinkmanship-prone activities]{.underline} 12) through offensive
peacetime maneuvers at sea and in the air, especially close to the air
defense identification zones (ADIZ) of NATO countries and NORAD,

[Regular [snap military exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}, strategic
[[bomber overflights]{.underline}]{.mark} and patrol activities, and the
[[weaponization of]{.mark} notices to air missions]{.underline} 13)
([[NOTAM]{.underline}]{.mark}) in the Barents Sea, across North Pole
approaches, and close to the Bering Strait and Alaska -- including with
China14),

Seabed warfare activities15), and notably the disruption of critical
undersea infrastructure (CUI) such as energy pipelines and fiber optic
data cables across Arctic chokepoints,

GNSS/[[GPS jamming]{.underline}]{.mark} and recurrent [[electronic
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} operations16) in Lapland and Finnmark in
the European High North -- [[with severe risks for civilian and
commercial assets.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Risks of miscalculation]{.underline}

[A more vulnerable yet assertive Russia in the Arctic, coupled with more
[NATO attention]{.mark} towards the region, can only [mean]{.mark} that
the [risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation [provoked by civilian and military
accidents]{.mark}, incidents, and tactical errors will
increase.]{.underline} Because of the absence of clear lines of
communication and deconfliction between Russia and the Arctic 7
countries, [it could [lead to]{.mark} unintended [escalation]{.mark} and
further down the road, to military tension if not conflict]{.underline}.

This situation is worsened by the fact that [[Moscow's restraint]{.mark}
over such events [cannot be taken for granted]{.mark}
anymore]{.underline} -- as exemplified by [Russia's continued low
intensity warfare operations in peacetime against Arctic nations and
NATO allies]{.underline}. Finally, the absence of Russian transparency
regarding recent environmental disasters 17) in the region adds more
complexity to peacefully solving potential crises.

Another form of risk relates to [[horizontal escalation]{.mark} -- i.e.
military tension from other theaters such as the North Atlantic or the
North Pacific [spilling over into the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the context of the Finnish and Swedish adhesion to NATO, the Baltic Sea
represents a key area for horizontal escalation towards the Arctic.

Finally, [[miscalc]{.mark}ulations [could happen in]{.mark} the context
of Russian [sharp power activities]{.mark} in circumpolar
governance]{.underline} -- for instance, [the contestation of the
Svalbard Treaty with Norway or exploiting recent decisions]{.underline}
18) by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)
[regarding Russia and the United States. As a knee-jerk reaction, Moscow
also recently threatened to withdraw from the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea]{.underline} (UNCLOS).19)

Freedom of navigation?

[The [main risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation with Russia, however, pertains
[to]{.mark} Moscow's contestable [interpretation of]{.mark} the legal
status of the [Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline} (NSR). [For
years, the Kremlin has been projecting the NSR as a body of internal
waters covered by Article 234 of the Law of the Sea]{.underline} (also
known as the 'Ice Clause'), therefore offering Russian authorities the
possibility to enforce 'non-discriminatory laws and regulations'20) over
ice-covered areas.

The issue is twofold. On the one hand, the impact of [[climate
change]{.mark} is completely res[huffl]{.mark}ing]{.underline}
[[access]{.mark} to the AZRF,]{.underline} in turn [preventing Russia
from invoking the clause to increase control over the NSR because of
seasonal sea-ice reduction. On the other hand, Moscow's application of
'non-discriminatory' rules is, in fact, highly
discriminatory]{.underline}. Indeed, for the past few years, Russia has
been introducing stringent national regulations clearly violating UNCLOS
-- for instance by strengthening navigation rules and transit rights or
interdicting passage to foreign military assets21) through the NSR.

Moscow seeks to appropriate the NSR as a body of internal waters
regulated by Russian law, and no longer linked to UNCLOS under the
principles of freedom of navigation and innocent passage. [[This
obsession for control responds to the fear of 'encirclement]{.mark}' in
the Arctic and the unwarranted belief that NATO will soon contest the
self-appropriation of the NSR.]{.underline}

[[Russian fears]{.mark} have crystallized in the belief that NATO or the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates are willing to conduct a freedom of
navigation operation]{.underline} (FONOP) through the NSR [to
['test']{.mark} innocent [passage in contested
waters]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most of these fears remain unfounded,
especially since there is little value in arranging such an operation as
well as high operational risk.22)

The fact remains that the [Kremlin's rhetoric]{.underline} around a
potential Western-led FONOP [has grown aggressive in recent
months]{.underline}, with NATO arguably seeking to 'snatch'23) the NSR
from under Russia's control. Furthermore, [the Russian armed forces and
the FSB (in charge of the Coast Guard and Border Guard) have reportedly
been making plans to 'counter'24) a potential foreign
FONOP.]{.underline}

Policy consequences

[Under the impact of climate change and the subsequent increase in human
presence across the Arctic, Russia will find it harder to secure its
'new' Northern border in the AZRF]{.underline}. So far, Moscow's
response has been to approach the region through a military lens,
leading to perimeter control and sovereignty enforcement as well as the
deployment of Arctic-specific capabilities and the revamp of dual use
infrastructure.

[The Arctic remains key to national interests, and especially the
survivability of the sea-based nuclear deterrent on both sides of the
AZRF as well as the security of North Pole approaches in the central
Arctic.]{.underline}

[Russia's imperative to remove tension from the Arctic is consequently
[adding pressure on critical regional chokepoints]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- notably in the European High North with the Greenland-Iceland-United
Kingdom (GIUK) gap, the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) gap, and the
'Bear gap' (between the Svalbard archipelago, Bear Island, and mainland
Norway) as well as in the Pacific Arctic across the Bering Strait.

In the High North, [Russian actions are [heightening tension]{.mark}
across the North Atlantic sea lines of communication and on the
Nordic-Baltic continuum regarding NATO reinforcements]{.underline}. As
the Atlantic Alliance is taking stock of the Finnish and Sweden
accession, more policy attention will be required to determine the exact
role and place of NATO in a circumpolar environment.

#### [Rebalancing]{.underline} attention to the Arctic [fails]{.underline} and risks [miscalc]{.underline} with [Russia]{.underline}.

Russian Action in the Arctic"

// ***mosuQ*** Accessed 6-30-2025.

The same cannot be said for Europe or the Indo-Pacific, where U.S.
interests are considerably more robust. [Practically, [the shift in
U.S.]{.mark} and NATO [strategic goals]{.mark} that would be required to
match Russian capabilities and credibly compete with Moscow [in the
Arctic is **not feasible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Russia has
twenty-two fully operational military icebreakers, the United States
only has two. There is also no consensus within NATO if the Arctic is an
area of military concern; [Canada, an "Arctic Five" littoral state, has
said repeatedly that it does not believe NATO should play any role in
Arctic matters]{.underline}.

Given limited resources, the United States and NATO should be focusing
on regions of existing contention with Russia, not simply shifting
military capabilities to a region out of some ill-defined need to
"match" Russia.

[[Aggressively **rebalancing**]{.mark} Russia in the Arctic [is]{.mark}
also **[not desirable]{.mark}**. There are [many feasible scenarios
where **military confrontation** could break out]{.mark}---[over
**resource competition**, **territorial disputes**, and **unsanctioned
passage**]{.mark} through the Northern Sea Route, to name a few. But the
most plausible scenario that could drive military conflict and greater
frequency of Russian military exercises is a **larger NATO military
presence**]{.underline}. Given Moscow's sensitivity to strategic
encirclement, a concern that has extended into the Arctic,
[[increasing]{.mark} NATO [operations]{.mark} are likely to [contribute
to the **security dilemma** and increase the **likelihood of
misperception and miscalculation**]{.mark}, undermining strategic
stability [in a rapidly changing region where there is]{.mark} currently
**[no mechanism for dialogue]{.mark}** on security issues]{.underline}.

The United States and its allies must find a way to preserve their
influence in an increasingly important region without making military
conflict more likely. For one, improving intelligence, reconnaissance,
surveillance (ISR) and communications infrastructure is a pivotal,
though less antagonistic, way to improve Arctic operational readiness.
The United States and its allies could utilize unmanned aerial systems,
high altitude balloons, and satellites in highly elliptical orbits
(HEO), which spend extended periods over the Arctic, to close the
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) gap and monitor Russian assets
in the region. Perhaps more importantly, since there is currently no
Arctic security forum that includes Russia, Arctic states should use
NATO's established dialogue channels with Moscow through the NATO-Russia
Council, as Dr. Rebecca Pincus has advocated. While NATO's military
function would be counterproductive, its political-organizational
function could help to lower the likelihood of miscommunication. This
forum would also open the possibility for greater collaboration on rules
to govern the region as it becomes more accessible to other actors.

[Ultimately, [at a time of **extreme regional flux**, it would be a bad
idea to **aggressively rebalance to the Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, once dominated by scientific
and environmental concerns, [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[become]{.mark} [the domain for military and economic
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Initiatives such as the International
Polar Years, with the first held in 1882--1883, exemplify the long
standing emphasis on scientific exploration in the region. [[Russia
remains]{.underline}]{.mark} 14 the most
[[established]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic power,
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[monopoly on (emerging) trade
routes]{.mark},]{.underline} a [significant icebreaker fleet,
[and]{.mark} geographic [proximity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This means an
advantageous position incase of a conflict,]{.underline} especially in
the initial 15 phase, being able to mobilise assets rapidly in the first
24 hours as supported by Zimmermann's analysis. 16 However, [in the
maturing phase of a conflict, this advantage is [offset by
**NATO**]{.mark}'s superior logistical capabilities,]{.underline} which
allows them [to scale and sustain an upper hand over an extended
period]{.underline}. This [[imbalance]{.underline}]{.mark} proves to be
a reason for discussion, as [each side's defensive measures are threats
to each other]{.underline}. The [showing]{.underline}-o [[between NATO,
Russia, and]{.mark} [emerging influences like China
underscores]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[need for a balanced, cooperative
approach to the Arctic]{.mark}. [China's entry]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[with a]{.mark} singular [warship]{.mark} into the Arctic Ocean
[marks]{.mark} [a new phase in **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations [and increases tension]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even
though [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is not an Arctic state, it has
[[declared]{.mark} [itself]{.mark} a]{.underline}
"[[near-Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [state]{.underline}" [proven
by]{.underline} its significant [investments in the Polar Silk Road
Initiative]{.underline}. [[This creates precedence for]{.underline}
[other]{.underline}]{.mark} [geographically indirect]{.underline}
[[states to claim]{.mark} [justification for entry]{.mark} into the
region as engagement is no longer isolated to geographic
proximity]{.underline}. The **[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
[[between Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [economically and
militarily]{.underline} 21 [[forms]{.mark} an increasing [risk]{.mark}
[for NATO's long-term planning]{.mark}]{.underline} and potentially
threatens their maturity phase overhand in case of conflict. China as of
2020 had a total navy battle force count of 360 to the United States 296
and by 2030 China is projected to increase to a total of 425 and the
United States to 290. This projected 135-ship difference, though across
different classes and likely quality, changes the domain and aids in
equalizing Russo-Sino leverage in negotiations with NATO. [It is
becoming a multipolar balance of power]{.underline} denied by a lack of
a singular state or alliance able to exert total authority. The
**[[increasing]{.mark} (joint) [exercises]{.mark} [and asset
developments increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of accidents or
miscalculations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As highlighted by Zimmerman,
**[[especially around the]{.mark} GIUK-N [Gap and Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[even minor incidents]{.mark} can
[result in escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[Near-misses]{.underline}]{.mark} in military maneuvers, [such as the
2019 near-collision between Russian and U.S. naval vessels]{.underline}
in the Bering Sea, [[underscore the need]{.mark} to
directly]{.underline} [address tensions to prevent these

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [the spectre of [a
**third world war** looms on the **horizon**]{.mark}. Military and
political leaders in **NATO** nations have issued chilling warnings for
populations to brace for [the possibility of **devastating superpower
conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Admiral Rob Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the opening
salvo in the grim round of predictions. He cautioned that Russia could
launch an attack within the next two decades. In words reminiscent of
World War II, Bauer urged allied countries to mobilise citizen armies.

British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has gone even further, foreseeing
[potential wars [involving]{.mark} **China**, **[Russia]{.mark}**, North
Korea and Iran [within the **next five years**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
situation is transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war world", he
asserted bleakly.

General Sir Patrick Sanders, the UK's army chief, echoed that dark
prediction. He described the British population as a "pre-war
generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an increasingly
aggressive Russia.

German politicians and military leaders have discussed resurrecting
mandatory military service in response to growing threats and Sweden has
already introduced a form of national service as it closes in on NATO
membership.

To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks on
Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable.

However, amid the drumbeats of international conflict, [one crucial
factor is being overlooked: the impact of **climate change** as a
potential **trigger for war**.]{.underline}

NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate and
security. Yet the landmark climate agreement reached late last year at
the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for Western leaders
meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and translate them
into tangible action.

[NATO recognises climate change as a **'threat amplifier'** for
traditional security issues, but it needs to go further as studies
indicate **global [warming]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} already [**rapidly
accelerating** the **likelihood of armed conflict**]{.mark}, especially
[in the **Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Arctic **icecaps**]{.mark} **are [melting]{.mark}** at record rates,
making deposits of gas, oil and minerals worth trillions of dollars
accessible for the first time. Over the coming years, this [will **spark
a race** for Arctic dominance]{.mark} that **Russia** is hellbent on
winning.]{.underline}

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, **Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}** [believes]{.mark} **domination** of [the
region]{.mark}'s resources [is **critical** to the]{.mark} economic
[**survival** of his **regime**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic is
estimated to hold 412 billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the
world's undiscovered reserves.

[Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [Russia]{.mark} already
[operates]{.mark} a third [more Arctic **military bases** than the
**US** and]{.mark} its **[NATO]{.mark}** allies. [Now Putin is]{.mark}
moving soldiers, icebreakers, warships and submarines to the region, as
well as [conducting Arctic drills that test hypersonic missiles capable
of **evading American defences**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

His propaganda machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in
white fatigues and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow
on sleighs pulled by reindeer.

America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in the central Arctic
Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a titanium Russian flag
on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North Pole.

[More [aggressive Russian claims in the Arctic could **force NATO to
act** and]{.mark} risk **[spark]{.mark}ing** the **[global
conflict]{.mark}** that the generals and politicians are warning of.
While traditional military preparations for global war are undoubtedly
vital, [leaders]{.mark} convening at Munich [must]{.mark} also
[**prioritise climate action** to mitigate]{.mark} the risk of global
warming becoming the **catalyst** for a **[catastrophic
clash]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Following the COP28 agreement to 'transition away from fossil fuels',
NATO must modify its climate ambitions and let the consensus reached in
Dubai guide its strategy to head off the threat of global war provoked
by climate change.

The Dubai agreement has been endorsed by 198 countries, including NATO
allies. However, in the words of COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who is
also attending the Munich conference: "An agreement is only as good as
its implementation ... We must take the steps necessary to turn this
agreement into tangible action."

NATO's focus should extend beyond its current voluntary emissions
reduction targets to include COP28's agreement to triple renewable
energy capacity by 2030.

[Since **[halting Arctic warming is pivotal to preventing]{.mark}
conflict**, NATO must also explore safe geoengineering solutions to slow
or reverse Arctic melting.]{.underline}

[It is time for world leaders to act in the knowledge that failure to
urgently address the climate emergency exposes the world to the risk of
[a **devastating conflict between NATO and Russia**]{.mark}, as well as
the wider **environmental dangers** of unchecked climate
change.]{.underline}

stretching military resources, disrupting economic stability, and
intensifying great power rivalries]{.underline}. Below, we explore how
Arctic dynamics interact with these regions, [creating multi-front
risks]{.underline}.

Arctic as a Strategic Amplifier Geopolitical Context: The [Arctic holds
13% of the world's undiscovered [oil]{.mark}, 30% of [natural gas,
and]{.mark} critical [minerals]{.mark} like rare earths[, making it a
prize]{.mark} for energy and tech-dependent powers]{.underline}. The

invests]{.mark} in polar infrastructure, [and NATO]{.mark} (bolstered by
Finland and Sweden) [enhances its presence, creating a]{.mark} tense
[standoff]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Mechanisms of Amplification: Resource Competition]{.underline}: [Arctic
oil, gas, and minerals are vital for global supply chains. A [scramble
for control]{.mark} could [divert resources]{.mark} and [attention from
other crises, weakening responses]{.mark} elsewhere.]{.underline}

[Military Stretching: Arctic tensions require naval, air, and cyber
deployments, straining U.S. and NATO forces already committed to
Ukraine, Taiwan, or the Middle East]{.underline}.

[Alliance Dynamics: Russia-China cooperation in the Arctic (e.g., joint
patrols) could align their strategies in other theaters, while NATO's
Arctic focus might [reduce cohesion]{.mark} in addressing non-European
crises.]{.underline}

Economic Disruptions: [Arctic [incidents]{.mark} (e.g., sabotage of
shipping routes) could [spike]{.mark} energy and mineral
[prices]{.mark}, [compounding economic pressures]{.mark} from other

Arctic Tensions and [Ukraine]{.underline}

[Interconnection]{.underline}: [Russia's Arctic militarization is
closely tied to its war in Ukraine]{.underline}. The Arctic provides
[economic lifelines]{.underline} (e.g., Yamal LNG exports) to [offset
Western sanctions]{.underline}, while Ukraine diverts Russia's
conventional forces, limiting its Arctic deployments. However[,
[Arctic]{.mark} tensions could [amplify]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark}
crisis in several ways]{.underline}:

[[Resource Diversion]{.mark}:]{.underline} A [Russia-NATO confrontation
in the Arctic]{.underline} (e.g., over Norwegian oil platforms) could
[pull U.S. and European resources]{.underline} (e.g., [naval assets,
intelligence) from supporting Ukraine, [weakening Kyiv]{.mark}'s defense
against Russian advances]{.underline}.

[Escalation Dynamics]{.underline}: [[Russian **cyberattacks or hybrid
actions**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} (e.g., cutting undersea
cables, as suspected in the 2024 Baltic Sea incidents) could [coincide
with intensified offensives in Ukraine, testing NATO's ability to
respond]{.underline} on two fronts. [This could embolden Russia to
**[escalate nuclear rhetoric]{.mark}** or hybrid warfare in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}.

China's Role: [[China's Arctic investments]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
with Russia's Rosneft) [[strengthen Moscow]{.mark}'s war economy,
indirectly sustaining its Ukraine campaign]{.underline}. A U.S.-China
clash over Arctic minerals could align China more overtly with Russia,
complicating NATO's strategy.

[Multi-Front Risk]{.underline}: A [simultaneous [Arctic-Ukraine]{.mark}
crisis could [overwhelm NATO's eastern flank]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially if Russia coordinates Arctic provocations with Belarusian or
Kaliningrad-based actions. The [U.S.]{.underline}, already supplying
Ukraine with billions in aid, might [struggle to deploy additional
forces to the Arctic]{.underline}, [[risking miscalculation or
escalation]{.mark} to a broader NATO-Russia conflict.]{.underline}

[Arctic Tensions and Taiwan]{.underline}

[Interconnection]{.underline}: The [[Arctic and Taiwan are linked
through U.S.-China rivalry and]{.mark} global [supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Taiwan's]{.underline} dominance in
[semiconductors]{.underline} ([60% of global supply) is critical for
Arctic mining and shipping technologies, while Arctic minerals are vital
for chip production]{.underline}. Arctic [tensions could amplify a
Taiwan crisis]{.underline} as follows:

[Strategic Distraction:]{.underline} A [U.S.-Russia Arctic
[standoff]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., over territorial claims) could
[[divert]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. naval and air
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Indo-Pacific, [[weakening
deterrence against]{.mark} a Chinese [invasion]{.mark} or blockade of
Taiwan]{.underline}. The [U.S. Navy,]{.underline} already stretched
across Atlantic and Pacific theaters, [faces capacity
constraints]{.underline}.

[China's [Opportunism]{.mark}:]{.underline} [China could
[exploit]{.mark} Arctic [tensions]{.mark} to advance its Taiwan agenda,
[timing]{.mark} military [exercises or]{.mark} a [blockade]{.mark} to
coincide with U.S. preoccupation in the Arctic]{.underline}. Russia's
Arctic alignment with China (e.g., joint resource projects) could

[Arctic Tensions and the Middle East Interconnection]{.underline}: The
[[Middle East and Arctic are linked through energy]{.mark} markets [and
great power influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic oil and gas could
offset Middle East supply disruptions, but [competition for Arctic
resources complicates Middle East stability,]{.mark} particularly around
Iran's nuclear ambitions]{.underline} [and the Strait of
Hormuz.]{.underline}

[Energy Market Volatility]{.underline}: An Arctic
[[incident]{.underline}]{.mark} ([e.g., Russian sabotage of Norwegian
gas fields]{.underline}) could [[spike]{.mark} global [energy
prices]{.mark}, compounding disruptions from a Middle East
conflict]{.underline} (e.g., an Iranian blockade of the Strait of
Hormuz). This would hit energy-dependent Europe and Asia hard, [[fueling
economic crises and unrest]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Iran-Russia Nexus: Russia's Arctic ambitions rely on revenue from
energy exports]{.underline}, some of which fund its Middle East
activities, [including support for Iran]{.underline} (e.g., S-300
systems). [An [Arctic crisis]{.mark} could [push Russia to deepen ties
with Iran, coordinating cyberattacks or proxy actions]{.mark} against
U.S. and Israeli targets in the Middle East]{.underline}.

[U.S. Overstretch: A [U.S. response to Arctic tensions]{.mark}
(]{.underline}e.g., deploying the Second Fleet) could [[reduce]{.mark}
its [Gulf presence, emboldening Iran to escalate nuclear
activities]{.mark} or proxy attacks.]{.underline} Conversely, [a
U.S.-Iran conflict would limit Arctic patrols, allowing Russia and China
to expand influence]{.underline}.

Multi-Front Risk: An [[Arctic-Middle East crisis]{.mark} could
[create]{.mark} a global [energy chokehold]{.mark}, with Arctic and
Hormuz disruptions driving oil prices to \$200 per barrel]{.underline}.
Russia and China could [exploit U.S. focus on the Middle East to advance
Arctic claims, while Iran's proxies escalate, [risking a regional war
with global]{.mark} economic [fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Broader Multi-Front Scenarios Synchronized Crises: The most dangerous
scenario involves simultaneous crises across multiple flashpoints,
orchestrated or opportunistic. For example:

Russia escalates in Ukraine and the Arctic (e.g., cutting cables,
seizing disputed zones).

China intensifies pressure on Taiwan, conducting a blockade or invasion.

Iran, backed by Russia, advances its nuclear program or disrupts the
Strait of Hormuz.

Such a scenario would overwhelm U.S. and NATO resources, forcing
prioritization and exposing vulnerabilities in allies like Japan or the
EU.

[[Russia's approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the
Arctic]{.underline} [[is]{.underline} [rooted
firmly]{.underline}]{.mark} [its overarching national security
objectives]{.underline}. In addition, Russia's th[awing Arctic border
has also led to a renewed priority for Arctic
defense.]{.underline} Russia [[views the Arctic
through]{.underline}]{.mark} [its broader]{.underline} [[national
security lens]{.mark}---including its]{.underline} [[perception
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[threat posed by the
U]{.mark}nited]{.underline} [[S]{.mark}tates---and]{.underline} [[Russia's]{.underline} [military

is]{.underline} [[consistent
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[national]{.underline}]{.mark} [security
doctrine]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [[defense
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}.[12 Russia]{.underline} [[houses
over]{.underline} [80
percent]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[sea-based
nuclear deterrent]{.mark}, including]{.underline} [at
least]{.underline} [[7 of its 10 SSBNs]{.mark}, along
the]{.underline} [[Kola Peninsula]{.mark}.13 Indeed,
the]{.underline} [[Arctic plays a]{.underline} [central
role]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[strategic
deterrence posture]{.mark}.]{.underline} In accordance with
its ["Bastion" defense concept, the]{.underline} [[Northern
Fleet]{.underline}]{.mark} [aims
to]{.underline} [[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[second-strike
nuclear capability]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [ensuring the
survivability]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[strategic
submarine force]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [a range of
highly integrated anti-access/area
denial]{.underline} [(A2/AD)]{.underline} [capabilities in close
proximity, including]{.underline} [coastal missile defenses, aircraft,
and]{.underline} [surface vessels]{.underline}.14 Indeed, strategic
bombers and anti-submarine aircraft routinely patrol over Arctic waters,
and three bases located along Northern Sea Route choke points are
outfitted with S-400 systems and Bastion-P cruise missiles. 

[Russia's Arctic military buildup and exercises suggest
a]{.underline} [[focus
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [an]{.underline} [[echeloned
defense]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline} [[protect its territory
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [SSBN fleet]{.underline}---it is increasing the
number of S-400 missile defense batteries across its Arctic territory;
Kotelny Island and Novaya Zemlya are equipped with Bastion-P and
Pantsir-S1 missile defense systems and backed up by advanced anti-ship
missiles; and Moscow is conducting submarine patrols through maritime
choke points such as the Greenland-Iceland-United KingdomNorway (GIUK-N)
Gap.15 Nonetheless, Russia's northern bastions are increasingly capable
of taking on more expansive missions, potentially allowing it to project
power and extend its influence into the NSR and Arctic.16 This buildup
could serve similar operational purposes to bastions Russia is creating
in Kaliningrad and the Black Sea, where its military has similarly
massed A2/AD capabilities, capable of engaging targets at longer ranges
and serving as fortified forward basing for missions into surrounding
areas.17

According to Russian officials and state press, the Russian government
has resumed operations at over 50 Soviet-era military bases in the
Arctic, including 10 radar stations and 13 air bases.18 And, as Russian
president Vladimir Putin announced in June 2020, [Russia
will]{.underline} [elevate]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [Northern
Fleet]{.underline} [to the level of a]{.underline} [de facto separate
military district]{.underline} [beginning in January 2021, highlighting
the]{.underline} [growing
military]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [strategic
importance]{.underline} [Russia attaches to the
region.]{.underline} (Russia has four other geographic military
districts.)19 Russia also believes that the United States intends to
increase its economic and military presence in the region.

Testing of military readiness is frequent; the Northern Fleet conducted
4,700 exercises and 3,800 test combat training exercises in 2017, for
example.20 In October 2019, Russia ran its
largest [[strategic]{.underline} [nuclear
exercise]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the Arctic,
Grom-2019,]{.underline} [[involving tactical and
strategic]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear]{.underline} [[forces]{.underline}]{.mark} [(including
a road-mobile RS-24 Yars ICBM)]{.underline} [[and all
four]{.underline}]{.mark} [of its naval]{.underline} [[fleets]{.mark},
indicating]{.underline} [Moscow's]{.underline} [[willingness
to]{.underline} [mobilize assets]{.underline} [from
all]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[military
districts]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [utilize
ballistic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [cruise
missiles]{.underline} [[to]{.underline} [defend]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [territory]{.underline} [[in
a conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.21

The [[Kola]{.underline}]{.mark} [Peninsula]{.underline} [[is central
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}. The centrality of the Kola Peninsula to
Russian defense in its northwest dates back to the Cold War, when it
stationed strategic bombers at what is now its Severmorsk-1 air base.
After a period of relative inactivity and decline of its military
installations on the peninsula following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, [Moscow is continuing to modernize and expand several bases
located in and around the Kola Peninsula, including its Severomorsk-1
air base, Gadzhiyevo submarine base, and Okolnaya submarine support
base.22 The air base upgrades in particular
are]{.underline} [[enhancing]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia's]{.underline} [[ability]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [A2/AD]{.underline} [defense
further from its northern coastline]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Russia
also]{.underline} [[houses]{.underline} [much of
its]{.underline}]{.mark} [seabased]{.underline} [[strategic nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark} [along the Kola Peninsula]{.underline},
where it also [periodically tests sea- and land-based ballistic
missiles]{.underline}.23 Moscow is [reconstituting its SSBN fleet---it
currently has four Borei-class fourthgeneration SSBNs, with plans to
eventually have at least 10 in total.]{.underline}24 Moscow currently
expects to complete its first eight ships by 2023 and the last two by
2027. Public reporting suggests five of these SSBNs will join the
Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severmorsk on the Kola Peninsula, and
five will be deployed to the Pacific Fleet.25 The Kola submarine bases
contain extensive submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) storage
and loading facilities, and Okolnaya may store nuclear warheads.26

Accessed 6-30-2025.

As [the world became more dangerous in 2024, [the use of]{.mark} its
[most dangerous weapons has become more likely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This trajectory raises the stakes for the new Trump administration as it
tries to end [[wars in Europe and]{.mark} the [Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} and, more broadly, [to reverse the ominous
path toward the use [and proliferation of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} that has been accelerated by these
conflicts.]{.underline}

[Vladimir Putin became more aggressive in Ukraine]{.underline} last
year, [[engineer]{.mark}ing the [collapse of the nuclear
guardrails]{.mark} built over seven decades [between]{.mark} the [U.S.
and Russia]{.mark} and [lowering the threshold for the use of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} He announced that
[[Russian]{.mark} nuclear [forces]{.mark} were [on full]{.mark} combat
[alert]{.mark} and soon followed with military exercises to test the
readiness of Russia's non-strategic nuclear forces in a combat
scenario.'']{.underline}

[[Putin]{.mark} capped the year by launching Russia's new hypersonic
ballistic missile against targets in Ukraine, while formally announcing
a revised Russian nuclear doctrine that officially [lowered]{.mark} [the
threshold for]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [to
meet]{.mark} a [conventional threat]{.mark} to Russian
territory.]{.underline} The revised doctrine also states that [an attack
against Russia by a non-nuclear power with the participation or support
of a nuclear power will be seen as their joint attack on
Russia.]{.underline}

U.S. defense analysts assess that Russia is not preparing to use nuclear
weapons in Ukraine, and Putin's nuclear threats are dismissed by
Ukraine's supporters as "bluffs" to curtail support for Ukraine. [But
Putin's rhetoric and policy revisions have had a significant
effect.]{.underline}

[Prior to the war in Ukraine, it was extremely rare for American or
Russian leaders to imply a threat of nuclear use.]{.underline} [Putin's
threats have dramatically shifted the lexicon on nuclear use, lowering
the psychological barrier for use and reopening a debate in Ukraine on
whether that nation needs a nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. Such
rhetoric, combined with the change in strategic doctrine, lowers the
threshold for using nuclear weapons not only in the current conflict but
in future ones. Furthermore, [[Putin must recognize]{.underline}]{.mark}
that, [[to maintain deterrence,]{.mark} he cannot keep issuing threats
before [action is eventually required]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia's need for support in the Ukraine war and the [consequent 2024
[Russia-No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea mutual defense [treaty make it more
likely]{.mark} that an unpredictable [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea will
[gain]{.mark} more [sophisticated nuc]{.mark}lear knowledge and
[tech]{.mark}nology.]{.underline} Russia also led the effort in the U.N.
to ease the pressure on North Korea's nuclear program by vetoing a
resolution that would have extended the mandate of the panel tasked with
reporting on North Korea compliance with U.N. sanctions.

These developments, on the heels of [North Korea's announcement that it
would no longer seek reunification and reconciliation with South
Korea,]{.underline} have [[reopened debates in]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Japan]{.mark} [on whether]{.mark} a
[non-nuc]{.mark}lear [status still serves]{.mark} their [national
security interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Similarly, [the [Middle East war]{.mark} has [undermined]{.mark} nuclear
[guardrails]{.mark}. [Iran may become]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons
[state]{.mark} in response to Israel's debilitating attacks on it and
its proxies.]{.underline} This, in turn, has unleashed speculation as to
whether [[Israel will preempt such a possibility]{.mark} by escalating
the conflict with a direct attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
[Iran]{.mark}'s closer [coop]{.mark}eration [with Russia and
China]{.mark} has also [increased concerns]{.mark} about further
cooperation on developing Iran's nuclear capacity.]{.underline}

[Looming over the deterioration of the nuclear guardrails and
contributing to lowering the nuclear threshold is [China's rapid
expansion]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear [force]{.mark} in
2024.]{.underline} As the Defense Department's recent report on China's
military capabilities explains, [China "probably perceives that a
stronger nuclear force is needed to deter U.S. intervention, check
potential nuclear escalation or first strike, and will allow for
increased control of the scope and scale of escalation during a conflict
in a way its previously smaller and less diverse nuclear force could
not."]{.underline}

[[Further rais]{.mark}ing the [nuc]{.mark}lear [risk]{.mark} levels are
advancing technologies. AI can dangerously automate the command and
control of nuclear weapons. The increased role of nuclear energy to
address climate change could increase the spread of nuclear weapons
capability, unless diligently addressed.]{.underline}

their allies, a new study has revealed.]{.underline} 

According to the researchers, [the]{.underline} [[conflict
would create]{.underline}]{.mark} [widespread]{.underline} [[fires
that]{.underline}]{.mark} could [eject up to]{.underline} [165 million
tons]{.underline} (150 million metric tons) [of soot]{.underline} into
Earth\'s atmosphere, [[leading to crop

and Russia]{.underline} [[that would
send]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[calorie production plummeting
by]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as [[90%]{.underline}.]{.mark} 

[The study]{.underline}, published Aug. 15 in the journal Nature Food
(opens in new tab), [is the latest in four]{.underline} [decades of
landmark research]{.underline} that has attempted to sketch out the
threat of a nuclear war. Of the world\'s approximately 12,705 nuclear
warheads, Russia has 5,977, and the United States has 5,428, according
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's latest report.
The country with the third most nuclear warheads is China, with 350.
India and Pakistan have 160 and 165, respectively. 

[[A full-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[war \"would
produce]{.underline}]{.mark} climate [[change]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
is]{.underline} [[unprecedented
in]{.underline}]{.mark} human [[history,]{.underline}\"]{.mark} study
co-author Alan Robock, a professor of climate science at Rutgers
University in New Jersey, said at a news conference on Monday (August
15). [\"In]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [[U.S.-Russia nuclear
war,]{.underline} [more

famine]{.underline}]{.mark}\] in India and Pakistan alone [[than
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the countries]{.underline} actually [[fighting
the war]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The most immediate effects of any
nuclear war, at least for those in a targeted city, have been popularly
known since the dropping of the U.S. atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" on the
Japanese city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6. 1945. The single bomb killed an
estimated 140,000 people within five months of its detonation and
destroyed or severely damaged more than 60,000 of the city\'s
approximately 90,000 buildings. Six eyewitness accounts, compiled by
journalist John Hersey and published in 1946, tell of the attack\'s
instantaneous devastation and its immediate aftermath. First, the light
of the bomb appeared as a blinding, \"noiseless\" flash as bright as the
sun; then the shock wave arrived, hurling bodies under toppling
buildings. In the aftermath, the clear, black shadows of the vaporized
dead were seen stenciled on the walls and streets, and the survivors who
were closely exposed to the blast emerged naked, their skin \"sloughed
off\" by the heat of the explosion, to wander the ruined city in stunned
bewilderment.

Studies sprung up as soon as 1947 to document the suffering following
the attack, which for many would last a lifetime. Radioactive fallout, a
byproduct of the nuclear fission reaction that gave Little Boy its
cataclysmic power, had blanketed the area. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
which was bombed three days later, increased rates of cancer, cataracts
and other health conditions persisted for years in survivors who had
been close to the bombs\' epicenters.

But it would take four more decades for scientists to begin to learn and
discuss the most lethal and frightening outcome of even a small-scale
nuclear war: so-called \"nuclear winter\". In this doomsday scenario,
radioactive dust and smoke would block out a significant portion of the
sun\'s light. With temperatures dropping, many of the world\'s crops,
smothered by the gloom, would die, creating a global famine and wiping
out billions of people.

 [To model how this]{.underline} apocalyptic event would affect the
planet\'s ability to sustain life, the [researchers
calculated]{.underline} the amount of [soot that would be generated
from]{.underline} six potential [nuclear war scenarios]{.underline}:
ranging from five scenarios based on a \"limited\" war between India and
Pakistan over the Kashmir region, which would produce 5.5 million to 52
million tons (5 million to 47 million metric tons) of soot depending on
the conflict\'s scale, to [full-scale global nuclear war involving the
U.S. and Russia, which would produce countless conflagrations veiling
the sky with 165 million tons (150 million metric tons) of
soot.]{.underline} 

With the soot quantities in hand, the scientists plugged the data into
the National Center for Atmospheric Research\'s (NCAR) Community Earth
System Model, a forecasting tool that simulates changes to Earth\'s
sunlight, temperature and precipitation. These changes were then fed
into NCAR\'s Community Land Model, which gave the scientists a
country-by-country breakdown of the dramatic reductions a nuclear winter
would bring to corn, rice, soybean, wheat and fish harvests.

Assuming that international trade stopped and that the remaining
resources weren\'t hoarded, the scientists subsequently calculated how
nuclear winter would reduce the food calories produced worldwide, as
well as the number of people who would starve as a consequence.

The [[researchers found]{.underline}]{.mark} that [in the
worst-case]{.underline} [scenario of a nuclear
war]{.underline} [[between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[U.S.
and Russia]{.underline}, [temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} on Earth\'s
surface [[would drop by]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as [[29
degrees]{.underline}]{.mark} Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius, or more
than three times the temperature difference between now and the last ice
age) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[5 billion people would
perish]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the most extreme war between India and
Pakistan, global calorie production could drop by 50%, causing 2 billion
deaths.

The longer-term consequences of nuclear war

In recent years, in some US military and policy circles, there has been
a growing perception that a limited nuclear war can be fought and
won. [Many]{.underline} [[experts believe]{.mark}, however, that
a]{.underline} [[limited nuclear war is unlikely to remain
limited]{.mark}. What starts with one tactical nuclear strike or a
tit-for-tat nuclear exchange between two countries could escalate to
an]{.underline} [[all-out nuclear war
end]{.mark}ing]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[immediate]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [utter
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark} of both countries.

But the catastrophe will not be limited to those two belligerents and
their allies.

[The long-term regional and global effects of nuclear explosions have
been overshadowed in public discussions by
the]{.underline} [[horrific]{.mark}, obvious,
local]{.underline} [[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} [of nuclear
explosions.]{.underline} Military planners have also focused on the

[[The Varied Roads to Armageddon]{.mark}:]{.underline} Unpacking the
Use-It-Or-Lose-It Dilemma

[The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has long been a staple of theorizing
about deterrence and nuclear weapons. It has undergirded explanations
for everything from strategic stability and escalation dynamics to
nuclear strategy and arms control]{.underline}. The dilemma appears, at
first glance, highly intuitive, and scholars have typically employed it
without further elaboration, confident that both they and the reader
appreciate its underlying logic. However, upon closer inspection, the
dilemma and the escalatory pressures it is believed to produce, are more
puzzling, if not wholly irrational. Here, I resolve the puzzle inherent
in the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma by identifying the [various mechanisms
by which it can encourage nuclear use]{.underline}, sketching three
non-rational mechanisms and more fully elaborating three rational
mechanisms. Disaggregating and specifying these mechanisms enriches our
understanding of a concept ubiquitous in the literature and sheds new
light on potential escalation dynamics in an interstate crisis or
conflict.

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has long been a staple of theorizing about
deterrence and nuclear weapons. It has undergirded explanations for
everything from strategic stability and escalation dynamics to nuclear
strategy and arms control. The dilemma appears, at first glance, highly
intuitive, and scholars have typically employed it without further
elaboration, confident that both they and the reader appreciate its
underlying logic. [However, upon closer inspection, the dilemma and the
escalatory pressures it is believed to produce, are more puzzling, if
not wholly irrational.]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} the simple, implicit model of [the use-it-or-lose-it
dilemma]{.mark}, two nuclear-armed states confront one another in a
crisis or conflict.]{.underline} For at least [[one]{.underline}]{.mark}
of those states, the survivability of its nuclear arsenal is so fragile
that the adversary [[could execute a disarming first
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this situation, the [nuclear inferior
state faces a Sophie\'s choice. It can launch its nuclear arsenal now,
inviting certain and destructive retaliation by the adversary. Or it can
wait and risk certain and equally destructive disarmament.]{.underline}
Scholars have reflexively interpreted this situation as [[encouraging
nuclear first use]{.mark} on the part of the weaker state under the
assumption that it is better to strike than not.]{.underline} But, upon
closer examination, the decision to launch now offers no benefits. If
the weaker state uses its nuclear weapons, its deterrent its expended
and it is exposed to certain destruction from the adversary. On the
other hand, [if it does not expend its arsenal, it risks having its
arsenal preemptively destroyed, again eliminating its deterrent and
exposing it to certain destruction from the adversary.]{.underline} The
state is [damned if it does, damned if it doesn\'t.]{.underline}
Presented in this way, the dilemma may encourage a nuclear strike, but
not for wholly rational reasons. Although much of the scholarly
literature has grappled with the inherent challenges of credibility and
rationality posed by nuclear weapons, scholars deploying the
use-it-or-lose-it dilemma in their analyses rarely specify the
underlying logic driving it. Further, in failing to articulate or
interrogate that logic, scholars and policy
[[analysts]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[missed important variation in the
pathways from the dilemma to nuclear escalation]{.mark}. The
[use-it-or-lose-it]{.mark} dilemma [is real and]{.mark}, in various
forms, [can encourage]{.mark} the [use of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s for
irrational, arational, and rational]{.mark} strategic
[reasons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Here, I describe that variation by identifying the various mechanisms by
which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma can promote nuclear use. I sketch
three non-rational mechanisms and more fully discuss three rational
mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms have previously been identified in
the literature, whether explicitly or implicitly. However, scholars who
invoke the concept to explain interstate crisis or conflict dynamics
rarely make explicit the underlying logic of these pressures. In doing
so, they conflate the various pathways by which the dilemma can
influence interstate dynamics. Here, I unpack the dilemma to reveal the
important variation in its forms. In doing so, I systematize and specify
the different forms in which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma may operate
and identify the conditions under which those forms are more or less
likely to arise.

I begin by discussing the use of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma in the
literature and briefly sketch the implicit model scholars often use to
describe and assess the dilemma. Next, I identify three embedded
assumptions in those models which, when relaxed, permit a more realistic
accounting of use-it-or-lose it pressures and how those pressures can
encourage a nuclear first strike. I then proceed to identify each of the
three mechanisms by which use-it-or-lose it pressures can operate,
discuss the conditions which are likely to make each mechanism more or
less salient, and provide illustrative examples. Finally, I close with a
discussion of the analysis and some concluding thoughts.

Use-It-Or-Lose-It Pressures in the Literature

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma is not the only domain in which nuclear
weapons can promote seemingly irrational behavior. [The world of nuclear
weapons is suffuse with paradox]{.underline}.1 It\'s a world in which,
according to the [logic of deterrence,]{.underline} the [hope of never
using]{.underline} a nuclear weapon [rests on the promise to use
one.]{.underline} As Brodie recognized, a nuclear capability should \"be
always ready to spring while going permanently unused. Surely there is
something almost unreal about all this.\"2 It\'s a world where the
enemy\'s attempts to shore up its defenses can be reassuring. Informed
that the Soviet Union had begun to harden its ICBM silos, U.S. Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara reportedly responded \"Thank God.\"3 And
it\'s a world where peace at one level can generate violence at another.
The stability-instability paradox predicts that while the deterrent
effects of strategic nuclear weapons may decrease the likelihood of
large-scale war between two nuclear-armed states, they may
simultaneously increase the likelihood of lower-scale conflicts.4
Schelling demonstrated the strategic advantages of the \"rationality of
irrationality.\"5

The use-it-or-lose-it dilemma is ubiquitous in the literature on nuclear
weapons. The Cold War arms control agenda was often centered on-or, at
least, some theorists claim, should have centered on6-efforts to avoid
the creation of use-it-or-lose-it pressures for either superpower since
it was feared that such pressures could produce dangerous crisis
instability.7 At the end of the Cold War, Posen implicitly relied on the
concept to explain how a conventional conflict between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact could inadvertently escalate to the nuclear level.8 One
analyst has lobbied for the United States to adopt a no-first-use
nuclear policy, in part, to reduce the possibility of creating a
use-it-or-lose-it dilemma for an adversary.9 The use-it-or-lose-it
dilemma has been used to explain the dangerous escalation pressures that
could arise in a conflict between India and Pakistan.10 More recently,
scholars have used the dilemma to highlight the escalation risks
stemming from misperception and possible conventional-nuclear
entanglement in a conflict between China and the United States.11

However, despite their propensity for invoking the concept, scholars
rarely specify the mechanisms by which these pressures could induce a
nuclear first strike on the part of the pressured state. In fact, in its
simplest form, the first use of nuclear weapons under conditions of
mutual vulnerability, even in the face of use-it-or-lose-it pressures,
is still irrational.12 Typically presented as a stark choice between
either preemptively using all of its nuclear arsenal or having all of
that arsenal destroyed, this implicit model seems to permit no room for
the rational use of nuclear weapons.13 Framed in this way, the pressured
(and presumably inferior) state faces a choice between certain
annihilation in case it preemptively uses its weapons and certain
annihilation in the case it does not.14 Indeed, as one recent work
critiquing the logic of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma has argued, \"We
may suppose that if a weaker adversary believes that it is about to be
hit first with nuclear weapons and wiped out, then it may take a chance
on striking first to try to inflict pain on the major power in order to
compel that major power to back down. But why would the major power back
down if the adversary has already expended its arsenal, making it more
vulnerable to a devastating riposte?\"15 [This critique embodies an
implicit model of the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma which scholars have
repeatedly deployed, whether in applying the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma
or critiquing it. In it, a weaker state is in conflict or crisis with a
stronger adversary. Both are nuclear-armed. But the weaker state\'s
capabilities are so meager by comparison that, if the stronger adversary
so chose, it could execute a complete and sudden disarming first strike
against it.]{.underline}

Accepting the conditions embodied in this implicit model, it is still
possible for the pressured state to launch a nuclear first strike for
either irrational or arational reasons. First, state
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting the use-it-or-lose it
dilemma, [[even if facing certain annihilation, may draw emotional
utility from inflicting damage on the enemy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Facing
the shadows and ash of an impending nuclear strike, state [[leaders may
launch]{.underline}]{.mark} their bombs, [[not to]{.underline}]{.mark}
obtain any strategic or material [[gain, but only to
hurt]{.underline}]{.mark} the enemy.16 Emotions, including [[revenge,
can be powerful]{.underline}]{.mark} forces in the conduct of interstate
relations, especially [[when nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s are
involved]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scholars have argued that a state is most
likely to seek revenge when it believes the harm it suffers is morally
outrageous, when it feels humiliated, and when \"international
retaliation is institutionalized by rules and laws that govern the use
of cross-border force.\"17 What would be more morally outrageous, more
humiliating, and more counter to the decades of non-use and just war
principles of proportionality and discrimination than the prospect of a
nuclear strike?18 [[The underlying biological and emotional
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} driving the desire for revenge may have
evolved to serve an instrumental deterrent purpose. But, as McDermott,
Lopez, and Hatemi illustrate, those mechanisms also operate
independently: \"Revenge is not motivated by the rational expectation of
future deterrence. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[driven by
the]{.underline}]{.mark} intrinsic [[pleasure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[one expects to experience upon striking back]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"19
This mechanism is more likely to operate in state dyads featuring
long-standing enmity, oppositional ideologies, or strident nationalism.

Second, the expectation that a nuclear-armed state might confront
[[these]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of [[pressures can
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} it to adopt a more assertive nuclear
posture precisely to avoid or mitigate the dilemma. The leaders of a
weaker nuclear-armed state may believe that adopting
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} more assertive [[nuclear
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[[decentralizes command]{.underline}]{.mark} and permits faster
launches, will increase the survivability of its nuclear forces. A more
assertive posture, characterized by peacetime targeting,
launch-on-warning, and [[pre-delegation, could increase the likelihood
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an accidental or [[unauthorized
launch]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Sagan illustrates, [nuclear weapons
programs are characterized by tight coupling]{.underline} (systems with
time-invariant processes) [and interactive complexity]{.underline} (many
interconnected and unplanned processes).20 These characteristics create
[systems which are prone to unplanned accidents.]{.underline} The U.S.
alone has experienced at least several dozen accidents involving nuclear
weapons.21 In the case of nuclear weapons, the risks inherent to any
interactively complex and tightly coupled system can be further
exacerbated by organizational pathologies in the military bureaucracies
entrusted with the weapons.22 This mechanism is more likely to operate
for states which are \"immature\" nuclear powers, meaning those which
are relatively recent entrants to the nuclear club and those which have
not yet developed comprehensive systems for securing and managing their
nuclear weapons.

Finally, state [[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} may launch a nuclear first
strike for strictly \"irrational\" reasons. Irrational, of course does
not mean impossible. Indeed, individuals [[confronted with time
constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}, induced [[stress, and uncertainty are
more]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to resort to decision-making styles
[[vulnerable to cognitive errors]{.underline}]{.mark}.23
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} are the very
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[abound in]{.underline}]{.mark}
interstate [[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} and conflicts. According to one
recent review of the neurobiological and behavioral studies literature,
\"when stressed, individuals tend to make more habitual responses than
goal-directed choices, be less likely to adjust their initial judgment,
and rely more on gut feelings in social situations.\"24 Studies have
shown that the presence of acute stressors induce individuals to resort
to cognitive heuristics of the kind representative of intuitive
decision-makers.25 This is a recipe for irrationality. Indeed, a recent
accounting of U.S. wargames during the Cold War found that, in every
instance in which a team used nuclear weapons, the constraints of the
crisis environment played a role.26 According to one wargame participant
at the time, \"If the US team had had more time to talk, it probably
would have decided not to use nuclear weapons after all.\"27 This
mechanism is more likely to operate for immature nuclear powers and for
states led by leaders featuring low levels of cognitive complexity. When
it comes to nuclear weapons, experience matters. At the level of the
state, Horowitz finds the likelihood of a nuclear-armed state to either
reciprocate a militarized challenge or have its own militarized
challenge reciprocated decreases over time.28 At the level of the
individual, research has demonstrated that deep relevant experience in a
given area can reduce cognitive errors in decision-making related to
that area.29 States with less experience with nuclear weapons and crises
involving them may be more likely to act in seemingly irrational ways.
Similarly, and apart from variations stemming from experience, the
state\'s susceptibility to irrational behavior may also vary with
cognitive characteristics of the leader, as Rathbun demonstrates how
variation in the cognitive styles of state leaders (whether highly
intuitive or highly rational) can drive variation in state behavior.30

Having identified three irrational or arational reasons a state
confronting the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma might choose to launch its
nuclear weapons, I now move to a discussion of the rational strategic
mechanisms by which the use-it-or-lose-it dilemma can induce a nuclear
first strike on the part of the pressured state.

Implicit Models and Embedded Assumptions

Scholars have often employed implicit models like that outlined above to
understand the concept of use-it-or-lose-it pressures and the limits of
those pressures in (rationally) affecting state behavior. These implicit
models contain three embedded assumptions which, together, make first
use of nuclear weapons under conditions of mutual vulnerability appear
irrational, regardless of the presence of use-it-or-lose-it pressures.

First, the implicit models assume complete and symmetric certainty on
the part of both the pressured state and its adversary that a disarming
first strike would succeed. The implicit model generally makes no room
for uncertainty, either on the part of the weaker state or the strong
one. However, the history of nuclear exchange modeling in the United
States shows that state predictions about the outcomes of a nuclear
strike were often fraught with uncertainty. Throughout the Cold War,
various U.S. agencies attempted to quantify the number of fatalities
that might result in a nuclear exchange with the United States.31 These
assessments exhibited significant uncertainty within assessment and
variation across them. For example, one such assessment of the nuclear
balance in 1962 conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense predicted
that the United States would suffer anywhere from 4 to 85 million
fatalities, while the Soviet Union would suffer anywhere between 10 and
95 million, despite the U.S. enjoying an advantage in total warheads of
25,000.32

Second, is the assumption that this complete destruction or disabling of
the pressured state\'s nuclear arsenal will happen nearly
instantaneously. If the pressured state faces the prospect of complete
and (near) instantaneous disarmament, then it faces a stark choice in
whether and how to use its nuclear arsenal. [Any forces which are not
used prior to the disarming strike will no longer be
usable]{.underline}. However, even if an adversary is able, eventually,
to complete a disarming first strike, [it may not be able to accomplish
it quickly enough to prevent a counterstrike, however limited that
retaliatory attack may be]{.underline}. The longer the window between
the destruction of the first nuclear asset and the last, the greater
opportunity for the pressured state to maneuver strategically in
response. The adversary may be able to destroy all of the pressured
state\'s nuclear forces, but the time it takes to do so will likely grow
with the size, sophistication, and diversity of the pressured state\'s
nuclear forces.

The technical and military requirements necessary to successfully
conduct a (nearly) simultaneous disarming strike are likely often
tremendous and these requirements increase with the size,
sophistication, and diversity of the opponent\'s nuclear forces. Forces
must, in military vocabulary, [\"find, fix, track, target, engage, and
assess\" the nuclear systems of the adversary.]{.underline}33 This can
be complicated when those adversary systems are concealed, mobile,
dispersed, and on varied platforms. [The underlying question is not
whether the state can successfully eliminate the adversary\'s nuclear
forces, but whether it can do so quickly enough without giving the
adversary time to respond.]{.underline}

Third, implicit [[models]{.mark} of use it or lose dynamics
[assume]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} pressured [state is confronted with
a]{.mark} sharp [choice between]{.mark} either [using all]{.mark} of
[its]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal or none]{.mark} of it]{.underline}. This
third assumption proceeds logically from the first. If the pressured
state faces certain and simultaneous impending disarmament, then there
is no reason to save some of its capabilities. Any weapons which are not
used now will necessarily be wiped out by the opponent and so, the
logic, goes if one is to use any of the arsenal, one might as well use
all of it. However, by relaxing these three assumptions, we permit the
pressured state [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} wider (and [[more realistic)
range of options]{.underline}]{.mark} in using its nuclear forces.
Specifically, [[the pressured state may opt to]{.underline}]{.mark}
launch a [[strike using only part of its arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark},
while reserving the rest of it for follow-on strikes or deterrent
signals.

Relaxing each of these three assumptions permits us to build models
which are both more realistic and which allow (unfortunately) for a
broader range of uses of nuclear weapons, including rational ones. If
the adversary is unable to execute a certain and simultaneous disarming
first strike, [[use-it-or-lose-it pressures are no longer concentrated
on a single point in time]{.underline}]{.mark} but, rather, operate
across a period of time. [[This lengthening of the time
frame]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[transforms]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[interactions]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two states from one best
modeled as a one-shot shot game to one modeled as a repeated game. [[In
the repeated game]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the time is compressed,
[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} still opportunity for interaction
between the two states, creating [[space for the rational use of
nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Below I review three strategic mechanisms by which use-it-or-lose-it
pressures can produce first-use of nuclear weapons: intra-conflict
signaling, asymmetric offset, and postconflict posturing, are all
strategic mechanisms. The operation of each of the strategic mechanisms
may be sensitive to both the embedded assumptions discussed above and
other features of the interstate conflict. For each mechanism, I provide
brief sketch of its underlying logic, a discussion of the conditions
under which the mechanism is more or less likely to operate, and a
real-world illustration of how the mechanism might work in practice.
Table 1 summarizes the six mechanisms, identifies their rational basis,
describes the underlying logic, and highlights conditions which
facilitate their operation. I make no claims as to the frequency or
likelihood with which each mechanism actually operates. These pressures
may still be rare and, even when present, need not mechanistically
produce a nuclear first strike. However, by adopting more realistic
assumptions about the conditions under which these pressures may
operate, we are able to see how states may still rationally perceive
some utility in launching a nuclear first strike.

Mechanism 1: Intra-Conflict Signaling

[[A state]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting use-it-or-lose-it pressures
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} feel compelled to launch a
[[strike]{.underline}]{.mark} if it believes the window need for the
disarming first strike to unfold is sufficiently large to permit the use
of its nuclear arsenal [[for intra-conflict
signaling]{.underline}]{.mark}. The signaling function of a nuclear
strike works largely because of the ability of the pressured state to
threaten similar future nuclear strikes if the adversary does not cease
its attacks. This mechanism is very sensitive to the length of time it
takes to execute the disarming first strike. If an adversary\'s
disarming first strike truly could be accomplished (nearly)
instantaneously, then there is no hope of retaining some of the force
for follow-on strikes, eliminating the possibility of intra-conflict
deterrent signaling. However, as the time frame for accomplishing the
strike expands, so does the potential for the pressured state to use its
remaining force to conduct intra-conflict deterrence signaling.

The intra-conflict signaling mechanism is more likely to operate when
there is greater uncertainty about the ability of the nuclear superior
state to execute a disarming first strike and when the expected time
needed to complete that strike is longer. This mechanism approximates
the strategy of limited retaliation described by Robert Powell.34 Here,
the pressured state faces the possibility that its nuclear forces will
be eliminated within a given window of time. However, if the window is
sufficiently large, the pressured state may attempt to launch a limited
nuclear strike against the adversary while still retaining some of its
capabilities. In this way, the strike is valuable not because of the
immediate damage it causes to the adversary, but rather because of the
implied future damage to the adversary. So long as the adversary may
have some uncertainty in its ability to completely and immediately
disarm the pressured state of its remaining nuclear capabilities, the
adversary may be deterred.

During the Cold War, war planners recognized the fact that nuclear
strikes themselves might be carried out over periods of hours to even
months, depending on the contours of the conflict. Some envisioned the
United States waging a \"protracted nuclear war,\" in which the conflict
would consist of a series of nuclear exchanges spread across up to six
months, with each side working to quickly reconstitute additional
nuclear forces.35 But even discussions of how the United States would
employ its nuclear arsenal in larger-scale initial \"spasm\" strikes
accounted for a \"transattack period,\" defined as "\[i\]n nuclear
warfare, the period from the initiation of the attack to its
termination.\"36 Planning for this period implies a recognition that
even large-scale initial strikes might not be executed instantaneously.
References to the imagined length of this transattack period are largely
excised from public sources.37 But one government source stated that
\"This period would normally be the first 12 to 14 hours after
attack.\"38 Though this window is certainly compressed by the standards
of large-scale conventional war, it also permits some maneuverability
within the conflict.

Mechanism 2: Asymmetric Offset

[[Use-it-or-lose-it pressures may cause states to]{.mark} launch a
nuclear first]{.underline} [[strike]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt
[[to asymmetrically offset]{.mark} the superior [conventional
capabilities]{.mark} of an adversary.]{.underline} In this way, a state
may view its nuclear weapons as crucial tools for deterring or defeating
a conventional attack.39 If the pressured state believes that the
adversary is likely to launch a large-scale attack and that its own
conventional forces are insufficient to either deter or defeat the
adversary, it may view its nuclear forces as a necessary means of
reducing the likelihood of suffering a devastating conventional attack.
The very perception that its nuclear capabilities are under threat could
even increase the perceived likelihood that the pressured state
confronts an impending large-scale conventional strike by the
adversary.40

Crucially, and unlike the intra-conflict signaling mechanism, the
asymmetric offset mechanism can operate regardless of whether, as
discussed above, the use-it-or-lose-it pressures are concentrated at a
point in time or are spread across a longer time frame. If those
pressures are spread across a longer time frame, the pressured state may
have more opportunities to use its nuclear arsenal in order to shift the
military balance in its favor. But even if those pressures converge on a
single point in time, [[the]{.mark} pressured [state may find it
rational]{.mark} to use its weapons [if]{.mark} it believes both that
conflict is imminent (or ongoing) and that [using its nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} can meaningfully [change the conventional balance.
]{.mark}]{.underline}The pressured state may still find it fruitful to
signal its resolve in the impending post-strike conventional conflict,
even if the underlying signal does not materially change the military
balance.41

The signal is also probably more likely to operate when the conventional
military balance between the states is both sufficiently large that the
conventionally inferior state sees an advantage in resorting to nuclear
weapons and sufficiently small that the nuclear offset could make a
meaningful difference.42 That is, in crises or conflicts featuring
overly large conventional military imbalances, no amount of nuclear
offset may be enough while in crises or conflicts featuring relative
parity, nuclear offset may be viewed as unnecessary.

This mechanism can operate at the level of the unified state, but it is
likely to be more pronounced for states which have developed an
asymmetric escalation nuclear posture.43 This posture is characterized
by the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons and the pre-delegation
of use authority for those battlefield weapons to lower-level military
commanders. Under these conditions, [[lower-level]{.underline}]{.mark}
military [[commanders]{.mark}]{.underline} may believe that the very
survival of their units and themselves is dependent on defeating a local
conventionally superior adversary force which could only be accomplished
by resorting to their own battlefield nuclear weapons. In these
instances, commanders [[may opt to launch a nuclear first-strike to save
themselves, even if it risks escalating the broader
conflict]{.underline}.]{.mark}

For example, a conflict between North Korea and the United States could
generate some of these pressures for the leadership in Pyongyang. As
Narang summarizes, \"If North Korea and the United States wind up
shooting at each other, it might make sense for Kim to use nuclear
weapons first in a way that increases his chances of survival. The basic
idea is to use one set of nuclear devices to stave off the conventional
invasion, and hold in reserve longer range, more powerful devices that
threaten the enemy\'s cities to deter nuclear annihilation.\"44 In this
way, despite the likelihood that the United States might be able to
eliminate North Korea\'s nuclear arsenal, Pyongyang may still attempt a
strike to weaken U.S. conventional forces in the region beforehand.

Mechanism 3: Post-Conflict Posturing

Finally, use-it-or-lose it pressures can lead to nuclear first use under
conditions of mutual vulnerability if the pressured state believes there
is a sufficiently high risk of all-out war, including the likelihood of
it suffering a nuclear strike itself. In this case, the pressured state
may believe that a large-scale conflict and its attendant destruction is
likely. Rather than concentrating solely on the immediate outcome of
this impending conflict, [[the pressured state may]{.mark} also [be
concerned about]{.mark} how quickly it could recover from the conflict
and, in particular, [whether it could recover faster than the
adversary.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This mechanism is more likely to operate when the pressured state
believes that the coming conflict is likely to represent total war. The
greater the expected scope and destructiveness of the conflict, the more
the pressured state may look to its long-term strategic implications.
This mechanism is also more likely to operate the greater the perceived
degree of parity between the overall power of two states. The greater
the power parity between the two states, the greater the parity in
expected recovery times and, therefore, the more sensitive those
relative recovery times will be to the immediate effects of a nuclear
exchange. However, in highly asymmetric crises or conflicts in which one
state enjoys a preponderance of power, it may be impossible for the
weaker state to meaningfully affect the relative recovery time of the
stronger state given the tremendous gap in starting points between the
two. If the gap in overall power between the two states is sufficiently
large and the nuclear capabilities of the stronger state are
sufficiently powerful, it may even be possible for the stronger state to
completely eliminate the weaker state a political entity, making moot
the issue of recovery time.

During the Cold War, U.S. decision-makers explicitly weighed relative
recovery time as an outcome measure in nuclear exchange planning and
modeling. In 1974, President Richard Nixon issued National Security
Decision Memorandum-242, \"Planning Nuclear Weapons Employment for
Deterrence,\" which outlined a framework for the employment of U.S.
nuclear weapons. That framework was concerned not only with the
immediate capabilities offered by the nuclear arsenal in a general war
with the Soviet Union. It also explicitly looked to the post-war era in
mandating that U.S. forces be able to create the \"\[djestruction of the
political, economic, and military resources critical to the enemy\'s
postwar power, influence, and ability to recover at an early time as a
major power.\"45 Similarly, in his 1977 report to Congress, Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld explained that \"We believe that a substantial
number of military forces and critical industries in the Soviet Union
should be directly targeted, and that an important objective of the
assured retaliation mission should be to retard significantly the
ability of the USSR to recover from a nuclear exchange and regain the
status of a 20th-century military and industrial power more rapidly than
the United States."46 The aim of U.S. nuclear strategy was not to
\"win\" the immediate war (though it did aim at that) but, more
significantly, to win the inevitable race to recovery which came
after.47

today [between]{.mark} seemingly more equally powerful states such as

mechanism is unlikely to operate between states with drastic disparities
in overall power for at least two reasons. First, the gap in overall
power between the two states is likely to be so large that it could be
offset only by a similarly large and opposite nuclear balance. Second,
the nuclear balance is likely correlated with the overall power balance,
meaning that the weaker state is unlikely to possess anywhere near the
massive nuclear forces necessary to offset its inferiority. For example,
the United States today enjoys such a tremendous relative power
advantage over North Korea that, in the event of a large-scale conflict
between the two, it is inconceivable that North Korea could ever hope to
enjoy a recovery time faster than the United States.

**[[Deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- an entrenched practice of
national security -- assumes state survival, [tacitly [accept]{.mark}ing
[the risk of **mutual destruction**]{.mark}. Reliance on deterrence is a
dominant feature of the LIO]{.underline}, however, NATO characterises
itself as a 'nuclear-armed alliance', for example. The perpetuation of
an envisaged future in which the US-led international order persists
problematises the establishment of ES. Consider that the "maintenance of
US nuclear weapons is a central tenet of the ideology of nuclear order,
so the futures envisaged by non-proliferation timescaping entail US
nuclear dominance" (Egeland, 2021 in Pelopidas, et al., 2024: 5). The
LIO, itself, is a threat to ES insofar as its reliance on deterrence
could lead to a global catastrophe. Whilst the 'blame game' is often
futile, here it illustrates that the liberal/illiberal divide in world
politics is effectively meaningless or will be made meaningless by a
nuclear catastrophe. ES contends that the nuclear dilemma cannot be
sidelined and should rank as the central concern during renewed
great-power competition. [Rather than guaranteeing global peace, the
deterrence system ‒ an embedded feature of the LIO ‒ and [the **norm of
non-use**]{.mark} (the 'nuclear taboo') may [**collapse** in the
next]{.mark} systemic **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Gibbons and
Lieber, 2019).

[[Should NATO and Russia engage in a **hot war**]{.mark} in future there
may come a day when [NATO retaliates]{.mark} to Russian non-strategic
nuclear weapon use, **[triggering a]{.mark} general [nuclear
exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Schneider, 2018). A report by
Euro-Atlantic Security states that [[the prospects of **controlling
escalation**]{.mark} or "terminating a conflict according to any
preplanned scenario" [are "**disturbingly small**"]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Kulesa, 2018: 1). [[Military-strategic logic]{.mark} would **[compel
nuclear retaliation]{.mark}** in this scenario as NATO would seek
victory in a conventional war with Russia]{.underline} (arguably the
purpose of the Alliance). [This scenario [blatantly
**threatens**]{.mark} **state [survival]{.mark}**. The possession -- and
preparation to use -- [nuclear weapons **ensure existential
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with no guarantee of national
survival. Adam Biggs (2024: 26) uses two historical case studies to
infer that "[[changed decision-making throughout great power conflict
creates an **escalating** chance of nuclear weapons]{.mark} use such
that a [nuclear attack]{.mark} is [**more likely** at the end]{.mark} of
a war than at its outset]{.underline}". This compounds risk in any
conflict involving a nuclear power. The war in Ukraine demonstrates,
further, that nuclear coercion remains a strong under-current in
international politics. A NATO-Russia 'hot war' has not been
inconceivable during escalations of the RussoUkrainian war, like
Western-leaders decision to permit Ukraine to use long-range missiles
deep into Russian territory (Grand, 2024). Moreover, Krepinevich (2024)
outlines the scenario of a protracted Sino-American hot war in an
article of Foreign Affairs. These challengers to the liberal order
clearly possess a 'hard-counter' to Western power in the form of amassed
nuclear weapons, apparent in an emerging Sino-Russian 'dragonbear'
alliance (see Tchakarova, 2015).4 Great powers neglect the nuclear
dilemma and these, now apparent, security dilemmas at their own peril.

The end of an era of cooperation is [turning]{.underline} the
[Arctic]{.underline} region [into an unsettled proving ground for
nations competing for access to natural resources, trade routes and
military advantage]{.underline}.

At the heart of the breakdown in relations is [Russia's annexation of
Crimea and subsequent invasion of Ukraine, actions that alienated fellow
Arctic nations]{.underline}. [Further [tensions have been caused by
Russia's increased activity]{.mark} in the Arctic [due to warming waters
that make passage possible as Russia expands]{.mark} investment there,
asserts its boundaries [and facilitates China's entry]{.mark} into the
region.]{.underline}

[With the end of a cooperative framework, the Arctic is rapidly becoming
the next contested area in great power competition]{.underline}, and the
U.S. is in danger of being a day late and a dollar short. [It is time
to]{.underline} take the lead and [invest]{.underline} both civilian and
especially military [resources in this incredibly important
geo-political region of the world. Failure to do so may have serious
consequences.]{.underline}

The strategic importance of the High North

The [[High North]{.underline}]{.mark} is defined as the region north of
the Arctic Circle, or above 66.5 degrees latitude. The region
encompasses 6 percent of the earth's surface in an area of 8.2 million
square miles, two-thirds of which comprises the Arctic Ocean.

The area [[is rich in resources]{.mark} and is estimated to hold
one-third of the world's natural [gas]{.mark}]{.underline}, [13 percent
of global [oil]{.mark} reserves [and]{.mark} vast quantities of
[minerals]{.mark} and rare-earth metals]{.underline}. The [Arctic
[also]{.mark} offers]{.underline} [three [valuable trade routes]{.mark}
for navigating the polar region, including the Northwest Passage, the
Transpolar Sea Route and the Northern Sea Route, the latter of which is
normally open for only a brief period each year]{.underline}.

Finally, the [region is of continuing [military strategic
importance]{.mark} due to its proximity to the U.S. and Russia and [as a
crucial link between]{.mark} the [Atlantic and Pacific]{.mark} theaters
of operation]{.underline}. Its [location is [also essential for]{.mark}
communications infrastructure including
[satellites]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Access rights to resources are held by eight Arctic nations including
Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia and the U.S.
However, [due to]{.underline} the [region's economic and strategic
advantages]{.underline}, [both Arctic and non-Arctic nations seek a
presence in the region]{.underline}.

The end of cooperation

Until recently, the High North enjoyed geopolitical stability and
cooperation among the Arctic nations, including the establishment in
1996 of [the Arctic Council]{.underline}. An independent
intergovernmental body, the council [began its mission by serving as the
leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation and coordination
among the Arctic nations]{.underline}, Arctic [Indigenous peoples and
other inhabitants]{.underline} with a focus on sustainable development
and environmental protection in the Arctic.

[As the council evolved,]{.underline} its [members supported creation of
an adjunct Arctic Chiefs of Defense Conference consisting of periodic
meetings during which the highest-ranking military leaders of the Arctic
nations would resolve issues, foster collaboration and provide
transparency for regional military operations.]{.underline} This
stability earned the region the label of "High North, Low Tension."

Unfortunately, these [**[cooperation]{.mark} efforts were [deeply
damaged ]{.mark}**[when]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} illegally
[annexed Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 and [then attacked]{.mark} the sovereign
territory of [Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022]{.underline}. [As a result of
these acts of aggression, the]{.underline} [[council members
ostracized]{.mark} the **[Russia]{.mark}**n Federation [and froze
communications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Putin acutely felt this due to
reliance on foreign investment and technology to fuel his plans to
achieve polar great power status.

But [**[Russia has proven]{.mark}** surprisingly **[resilient]{.mark}**,
and [its economy has rebounded]{.mark}. Its [military]{.mark} has also
been [boosted by]{.mark} a resilient [industrial
base]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There is currently **no dialog with
Russian**]{.mark} political or military **[leaders]{.mark}** in
the]{.underline} chambers of the [Arctic Council, and this has resulted
in a situation akin to having a "hot line" where neither side picks up
the phone when it rings.]{.underline}

MSU-shARK Accessed 6-30-2025.

[[The full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in February
2022 [[did not alter Russia's Arctic military posture]{.mark}. [If
anything]{.mark}, [Moscow's]{.mark} obsessive [search for complete
control]{.mark} over the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF)
[has been vindicated]{.mark} by wider geopolitical
developments.]{.underline} Nevertheless, Finland's and Sweden's
accession to NATO is making Russia feel more vulnerable from a military
point of view.

This [[self-perception of vulnerability will inform]{.underline}]{.mark}
how Russia projects itself in the region, especially through [low
intensity [war]{.mark}fare operations [against NATO]{.mark} and its
allies -- [which]{.mark} in turn [raises]{.mark} the [risk of
miscalc]{.mark}ulation [and escalation]{.mark} in a changing
Arctic.]{.underline}

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

From Moscow's viewpoint, the perceived 'enlargement' of NATO to Finland
and Sweden is fueling both a sense of vindication and vulnerability
across the AZRF -- geographically extending from the North Atlantic and
the European High North, to North Pole approaches in the Central Arctic,
to the North Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement' 1) by
the Atlantic Alliance has been validated by Finland and Sweden joining
NATO. [The double accession represents a fait accompli for the Kremlin,
honed by a self-reinforcing propagandistic narrative that the Alliance
is turning the Arctic into a 'conflict zone']{.underline} 2) or that
there is a 'new Cold War' 3) in the region because of Western policy.

[This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in 2022 and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force' 4) or 'inviting confrontation' 5) in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further fuels the Russian logic
that the non-Russian Arctic has become 'NATO territory'. This ends up
creating a 'NATO 7 vs. Russia'6) approach, which tends to securitize
Arctic affairs and shape discussions increasingly in military terms. The
policy consequences are that Moscow is planning more than ever for all
contingencies, including open military confrontation in the Arctic.

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, the impact of the war has led
Moscow to feel vulnerable in the Arctic. This vulnerability is strategic
(with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and military, especially with
regards to the impact of climate change and receding sea ice across the
AZRF.

[The [Russia]{.mark}n leadership [fears that a more accessible
Arctic]{.mark} will [bring]{.mark} along [more military activity from
NATO]{.mark} and its allies]{.underline} in the European Arctic and
above North Pole approaches. It also fears there will be more military
presence from the US and Canada in the Pacific Arctic -- alongside
Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and presence.

The [July 2024 Ukrainian drone strike]{.underline} 7) [on the Olenya air
base in the northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic bombers are
stationed, also reinforces their sense of vulnerability -- not least by
defying the genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air defense
capabilities.]{.underline}

Ultimately, Moscow does not want to be dispossessed of its control over
the AZRF. [[The fact that NATO's direct borders with Russia have
increased]{.mark} in size in the Arctic and Baltic theaters will
undoubtedly [push the Kremlin to adapt its force
projection]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [nuclear deterrence]{.mark} relationship [between the West and
Russia]{.mark} is becoming [increasingly unstable.]{.mark} Driven
by mutual [perceptions of insecurity]{.mark}, both are about to enter
a new arms race. The main problem is that each side is entertaining very
different threat perceptions on very different levels of military
competition.]{.underline} This [situation [heighten]{.mark}s the [risk
of a complete breakdown of]{.mark} the bilateral nuclear [arms
control]{.mark} architecture.]{.underline}

Vladimir Putin\'s state-of-the-nation speech in March 2018 made three
things abundantly clear. First, [the Russian
leadership is deeply concerned with US strategic missile
defence.]{.underline} This particular [Russian paranoia dates back at
least to the Reagan years of the early 1980s, and gained momentum when
Washington withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty]{.underline} in 2001. [[Russia has strong and irrational]{.mark}
[fears that its ]{.mark}strategic[ second-strike capability could
be dramatically impaired]{.mark}. Moscow has also quite warranted fears
that Washington's edge in military technology will only accelerate in
the coming years.]{.underline}

Second, President Putin\'s speech underlined how [[Russia]{.mark} is a
firm [believe]{.mark}r in [nuclear deterrence]{.mark} and its [ultimate
peace-preserving function]{.mark}. ]{.underline}Third, the speech showed
that [Russia views nuclear weapons as a compensatory
element [against]{.mark} the [backdrop of]{.mark} an otherwise very
strong [power imbalance]{.mark} vis-à-vis Washington.]{.underline}

nuclear level.]{.underline}

Paradoxically, therefore, Russia's failed attempt to rapidly seize
Ukraine has led to more Arctic predictability. Russia's failure to win
decisively in Eastern Europe has, in relative terms, led to more crisis
stability outside Norway. The General Staff's military blunder and
failed coup d'état in Kyiv has become a regional tranquilizer in one of
the most sensitive operational areas on Earth. The finding coincides
with conclusions drawn by Kristian Åtland et al., claiming

\[...\] the dominant pattern of Russia's sea and air exercises on NATO's
northern flank has changed significantly in the time that has passed
since February 2022. Particularly noteworthy is the shift in location
\[...\] from the Norwegian Sea to the Barents Sea.83

[[The finding]{.mark}, however, **[must not be interpreted as a claim of
Arctic peacefulness]{.mark}**. Malign subwater [activities with attack
**sub**]{.mark}**marine[s]{.mark}**, underwater [**drones**, and
**special forces** preparing for **sabotage** against **critical
infrastructure**]{.mark} on the seabed,
**[accelerate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.84 This is also the case with
numerous civilian research and fishing vessels pursuing covert
operations below the threshold of war. Examples are possible sabotage
against fiberoptic cables, mapping of gas pipelines, hazardous maneuvers
with jetfighters against personnel on oil rigs, reconnaissance on
critical objects, electronic jamming of GPS signals, unexpected flows of
refugees across borders, or outright provocations to map adversaries'
response time and readiness. These [so-called **['hybrid
threats']{.mark}**]{.underline} are nevertheless less dangerous than
nuclear rivals aiming to "manipulate the shared risk of war". Malign
operations below the threshold of war are primarily a law enforcement
issue. These challenges belong to the police rather than the military
and should primarily be seen as a perennial phenomenon evolving between
rivals. 85 [To Russia in particular, this modus operandi -- in crisis
short of war -- has become the **most likely course of action** due to
Russia's military inferiority vis-à-vis NATO and the United
States]{.underline}. Russia's secret services, like the FSB, GRU and
SVR, is therefore a more useful political instrument than the Northern
Fleet or the Leningrad Military District.

Validating the conclusions, my findings coincide with historical
accounts. Suggesting that "\[...\] the potential for conflict or
cooperation in the Arctic \[is\] a consequence of the grand strategies
of the great powers and events outside the region",86 the brinkmanship
outside Norway's coast signify the broader great power rivalry. When
tension is reasonably low, as during the malign 2014--2021 period, the
Arctic is likely to experience more antagonism and dangerous
brinkmanship. This is because the risk of coercive action is seen as
strategically acceptable in Moscow and Washington D.C. But as tension
increases, such as during the benign 2022--2024 period, restraint is
likely to prevail. This is because threat-manipulation is simply too
dangerous. Hazardous situations must be avoided so that regional wars in
one theater do not spill over into a nuclear armageddon. Arctic
brinkmanship, visualized through means of coercion and restraint,
thereby fluctuates with the broader U.S.-- Russian relationship.

[[The findings]{.mark} nevertheless [need more **scrutiny**.
**Simplified** univariate models do not provide a **sufficiently
comprehensive understanding**]{.mark}. As we try to explain the
U.S.--Russian pause in the Arctic, **more variables** need to be
**analyzed**. [As the dependent variable war avoidance unfolds inside a
**complex** political, social and economic context, unwanted covariance
from variables that go beyond military restraint are]{.mark} likely to
be **[at play]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A reasonable objection is that
military restraint is vaguely defined. The two indicators "broader
security concerns" and "strategic necessity" contain numerous 'concerns'
and 'necessities' beyond nuclear war apprehensions and over- stretch
problématique. Hence, [**economic** variables, such as the United
States' historical **budget** deficiency, or **Russia's dependency** on
a stable Arctic that fuels the Kremlin with 10 percent of its gross
domestic product and 20 percent of its exports may also have explanatory
power]{.underline}.87 [In that sense, the constructivist approach
depicted by Crawford, [emphasizing **economic interdependence** and
**military vulnerability**, could be **fruitful**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[self-imposed **restraints** continue]{.mark}d]{.underline} into
2024, but [more so [on the **Russian**]{.mark} than on the Western
[side]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the unmatched size and location of
NATO's Nordic Response exercise in March, where approximately 20,000
troops from 13 nations exercised in an area only 200 kilometers from the
Russian border in west Finnmark, [Russian [reactions were
**modest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even though B--1 and B--52 strategic
bombers from the U.S. Air Force operated north of the Arctic Circle,
neither NOTAMs nor snap exercises were launched from the Russian
side]{.underline}. Neither were any provocative maneuvers observed west
of the Bear Gap. Apart from two Tu-142 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) on
an observer mission in the Norwegian Sea, the Northern Fleet followed
NATO's exercise from defensive positions east of the Gap. 71 NATO
nevertheless launched its annual Dynamic Mongoose anti-submarine warfare
exercises one month later. But contrary to the unusual 2019 deployment
north of the Arctic Circle, the exercise unfolded 1,500 kilometers
further west, outside the Arctic Circle. 72 [Rather than focusing on the
**strategically significant Bear Gap**, which is one of the **key
avenues** into Russia's nuclear staging areas, [the Pentagon's updated
**2024 Arctic Strategy** emphasized]{.mark} "areas such as [the
Greenland-Iceland-U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom
[gap]{.mark}"]{.underline}. 73 [This was, according to the strategy,
"**[to reduce the possibility of escalation and
misinterpretation]{.mark}**"]{.underline}. 74 The Pentagon's muted and
discreet wording contrasts the 2019 Arctic Strategy. Whereas
"competition" with Russia was mentioned 17 times in 2019, the 2024
version mentioned it only twice. [While Russia was deemed a **key
threat** in 2019, [**China** replaced the Russian threat in the
2024]{.mark} Arctic [Strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. 75

Russia's benign response not only coincided with the 2022 guidance and
its' inner bastion defense concept. The response also deviated from the
operational pattern that normally takes place outside the Norwegian
coast. During interfleet transitions between the Barents Sea and the
Baltic Sea, Northern Fleet capabilities usually perform live fire
exercises with missiles outside Norway's coast. According to The Barents
Observer editor, Thomas Nilsen, this is "standard operational procedure"
each time Russian naval surface groups transit between St. Petersburgh
and Murmansk. But in July, en route to The Navy's Day in St. Petersburg
and on the return trip, no missiles were fired. 76 The unique
abstentions deviate from a consistent pattern where the Northern Fleet
traditionally sees the Norwegian coast as a normal exercise area. The
abnormal cancellation may signify a more evasive Russian modus operandi
in the Norwegian Sea. The deviation is thus consistent with the
unprecedented cancellation of the Zapad 2023 exercise, which again seems
to have been postponed in 2024. [The two [incidents indicate a
**weakened Northern Fleet**]{.mark}; a strategic force [that
Pentagon]{.mark}'s 2024 Arctic Strategy [describes as **barely having
"the potential to hold the U.S.**]{.mark} **homeland...[at
risk]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}77 In other words, this is a force that
since 2022 no longer can "manipulate the shared risk of war" against its
western rival.

However, the partnership is not without its challenges. [[Russia and
China have **different long-term interests in the Arctic**]{.mark}, and
[as China's influence]{.mark} in the region [grows, it could challenge
**Russia's dominance**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nan & Peiqing, 2022). While
the two countries share common economic interests, particularly in
energy, [there is [potential for **competition**]{.mark} over
**resources, infrastructure, and control of shipping
routes**]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark}, as an Arctic state, [views the
region as a **core element** of its]{.mark} national [sovereignty
and]{.mark} has worked to [**ensure** its **dominance**]{.mark} in
Arctic affairs. [Moscow's approach is]{.mark} largely
**[unilateral]{.mark}**, seeking to control the development of the
**NSR** and the vastness of **Arctic resources**, [and]{.mark} has been
**[resistant to external influence]{.mark}** in the region, keen on
maintaining a tight grip on Arctic governance]{.underline} (Cao, 2022).

China, on the other hand, advocates for a more multilateral approach to
Arctic governance, where non-Arctic states, like itself, can play a role
in shaping the future of the region (The State Council Information
Office of the People's Republic of China, 2018; Xinhua, 2018). [[China's
growing involvement]{.mark} in **Arctic governance institutions**, such
as the **Arctic Council**, [could lead to **friction** with
Russia]{.mark}, which views the region as primarily the domain of the
Arctic states. [As China seeks **greater influence**]{.mark} in Arctic
decision-making, [Russia]{.mark} may **[resist]{.mark}** these efforts
to safeguard its territorial and geopolitical interests. Moreover,
China's investments in Russian Arctic energy projects]{.underline},
while beneficial to Russia in the short term, [may eventually lead to
[greater **Chinese influence** in the region]{.mark}, which could
**[unsettle Moscow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[As for China, realism was consolidated with the upcoming of Xi
Jinping's leadership. The **revival** of a **realist assertiveness** of
China towards the world order was backed by its immense **economic
momentum** gained over the last two decades]{.underline}, and Xi
Jinping's Chinese Dream brought back the Tianxia concept from ancient
days. In this concept, [the notion of **flexible borders** also plays a
central role, corroborating the framework of the **BRI** and of the
**PSR** and granting them a **broader sphere of influence**. This
amalgamation of notions and goals puts Xi Jinping's China side-by-side
with Russia]{.underline} in their joint realist stance against the
unipolar world order that the US leads since the end of the Cold War,
and although the anti-Western hegemony front has been in place for over
a decade, its purpose has been better served with Xi Jinping's
revisionist policies.

[However, **[despite]{.mark} this [joint realist front]{.mark}**, the
[revisionism **inherent** to the partnership is far from]{.mark} being
**[consensual]{.mark}**. [Russia's]{.mark} embroidered [offensive
realism, with hard power]{.mark} and power politics [that relies]{.mark}
mainly [on military strength]{.mark} and the lack of fear of using it,
[clearly **contrasts**]{.mark} with [China's **diplomatically
rich**]{.mark} and **economically enhanced** [revisionist
agenda]{.mark}, that strives for a peaceful international environment,
[which ultimately serves to further expand its]{.mark} economy and
[influence in world power]{.mark}. Ultimately, [this **rift**]{.mark} in
the partnership further [emphasises that it operates **solely** on
mutual interests, denoting **deep diverging ideological alignments**,
which]{.mark} in the face of overlapping interests or arising tensions
in the **Arctic** could **[challenge cooperation in long-term
agendas]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Encompassed by these differentials and overlapping interests, [the
**Arctic**]{.mark} region [stands in the **forefront** of]{.mark}
possible **[Russia-China clashing agendas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
both countries give primacy to their individual interests rather than
the wellbeing of the cooperation, [different views about Arctic
governance can rip the cooperation that well serves both states in
current times]{.underline}. [[Russia's **unilateral stance** about the
Arctic]{.mark} region, a beacon of its national identity and
sovereignty, [is **incongruent** with China's]{.mark} advocacy for a
[**multilateral** approach]{.mark} to the North Pole, [where even
countries that do not have territories]{.mark} within the circumpolar
region [are entitled to]{.mark} its [governance]{.mark}]{.underline},
which would greatly serve China's resource needs and influence-gathering
agenda.

Thus, [the revisionist cooperation utopia stands into the spotlight of
the Arctic. While both states share a realist and revisionist agenda in
their cooperative partnership toward the international order, advocating
for the fall of Western hegemony and the rise of a new multipolar world
order, which further serves its economic and political ties, such
[alignment]{.mark} might [appear **displaced** when the **bilateral**
dimension of the partnership is **highlighted**]{.mark} above external
matters]{.underline}. The success of the revisionist realism that both
China and Russia exhale over their surroundings clashes when the same is
applied onto issues sprouting within the partnership, where reliance on
different methods of conducting revisionism brings hardships to the
cooperation that they both seek and emphasises overlapping interests,
mainly in the Arctic intertwines. Ergo, [the revisionist [cooperation
presents a]{.mark} potential [**blow** to]{.mark} the **bilateral
dimension** of **[Russia-China relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
order to sustain the level of cooperation witnessed nowadays and
safekeeping their diverging national interests, both Russia and China
have to carefully balance their inputs of revisionism over the bilateral
relations, given their critical need for both sides of the conundrum.

#### China-Russia arctic alliance [fails]{.underline}.

**Lanteigne 24** \[Marc Lanteigne (Professor of Political Science, The
Arctic University of Norway; adjunct lecturer, University of Greenland),
2-21-24, "A China-Russia Arctic Alliance? Not So Fast." The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2024/02/a-china-russia-arctic-alliance-not-so-fast/,

With the Arctic finding itself under ever greater global scrutiny due to
climate change, and opening up to increased economic activities, from
shipping to mining to fishing, the question of whether great power
competition is spilling over into the far north has assumed greater
importance. [One aspect of this attention has been the idea of
a]{.underline} probable, and perhaps even inevitable, [**Arctic pact**
between **China** and **Russia**]{.underline}, one based on mutual
northern interests and shared mistrust of the West.

At first glance, there is much evidence to support this view, especially
with Beijing declining to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and
instead adopting a nebulous policy of neutrality toward the conflict.
China and Russia are both pushing back against what they perceive as
NATO militarism and expansionism in the Arctic. The Polar Silk Road,
which the two states began to jointly develop after 2017, was meant to
further enhance Sino-Russian boreal cooperation, centering on the
Northern Sea Route connecting Asia and Europe via the waters abutting
Siberia.

These points of collaboration are now more commonly viewed as signals
that a deeper Arctic pact is forming between the two powers. One recent
example is a report, published earlier this month by American
intelligence firm Strider Technologies, which argued that China is
rapidly increasing its economic presence in the Russian Arctic and that
Moscow has opened the door to Chinese interests in Siberia and Russia's
Far East. This would suggest the powers are now openly seeking to
counterbalance the West in the Arctic in light of NATO's expansion to
include Finland and likely Sweden. In short, there is the conclusion
that the Sino-Russian "no limits" partnership -- declared in February
2022, on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine -- is allegedly thriving in
the Arctic.

[[A **closer look** at]{.mark} the pattern of [Sino-Russian
**cooperation** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past decade,
however, [[reveals]{.mark} much more
**[ambivalence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially on Beijing's part.
[[There are **concerns** with]{.mark}in both governments as to [each
other's]{.mark} future **[intentions]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Far from pursuing an "unlimited" partnership,
[[Beijing]{.mark} has instead **[selectively engaged]{.mark}**
Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic, in areas that reflect China's own
interests, such as increased science diplomacy, and has agreed to
purchase Russian oil and gas (at discounted rates).

As for overall shipping, [[Chinese firms have been **reluctant**]{.mark}
to use the Northern Sea Route since 2022 [due to]{.mark} concerns about
facing **Western [sanctions]{.mark}** for providing economic assistance
to Russia]{.underline}. Additionally, the Hong Kong-registered vessel
Newnew Polar Bear was placed under an uncomfortable spotlight after
being implicated in undersea cable cuts in the Gulf of Finland last
October.

China's stance on oil and gas development in the Russian Arctic has also
been sporadic, with Beijing remaining tepid on Russian interests in
co-developing the Power of Siberia 2 natural gas pipeline. Chinese
energy firms have made only infrequent protests over Western sanctions
on Russia.

The Strider report highlighted a considerable uptick in Chinese firms
registering to operate in the Russian Arctic as a sign of [deepening
bilateral [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. Yet this
leads to the question of whether these figures
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} an immanent increase in joint
China-backed Russian Arctic projects, or [[merely a **window of
opportunity**]{.mark} for Chinese interests to jockey for
position]{.underline}, given the spaces vacated by European firms
decamping from Russian partnerships. What remains to be seen is whether
the potential impact of the growing number of Chinese companies in the
Arctic will represent any significant economic power shift, given
ongoing Russian sensitivity to the economic sovereignty of its Arctic
lands, and the uneven track record of previous joint Polar Silk Road
projects in Siberia.

One notable example is the long-planned Belkomur rail link in western
Siberia, which was touted as a potential Sino-Russian investment in a
vital land link for Eurasian trade. The project remains in bureaucratic
limbo, with ongoing questions about its economic viability.

Moreover, China originally perceived the Polar Silk Road as eventually
linking Chinese interests with the whole of the Arctic, with plans
ranging from mining in Canada and Greenland, to rail links in the Nordic
region, to natural gas development in Alaska. [**[Few]{.mark}** of these
[projects are **likely**]{.mark} to move forward]{.underline}. Now
Beijing must deal with Russia as its only viable economic outlet to the
Far North, a situation the Chinese government did not anticipate when
the Polar Silk Road was first established.

Much [discussion of closer Sino-Russian Arctic ties ignores the fact
that [Moscow is seeking to]{.mark} further **[diversify]{.mark}** its
Arctic partners [**beyond** China]{.mark}]{.underline}, by including
India and countries in the Gulf Region. With Russian participation in
the Arctic Council reduced since March 2022, [Moscow has made **little
secre**t of its interest in looking for **additional** Arctic partners
**elsewhere**]{.underline}.

Last year, Russia called for a BRICS science station to be established
in Pyramiden, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, which would allow not
only China but also other members of the group such as Brazil and India
to participate. This came at a time when the BRICS are in the process of
expanding their membership, with countries such as Egypt, Iran, and the
United Arab Emirates already signed on (and the UAE has recently given
many indications that it is seeking to expand its own Arctic interests).
While China will remain an integral player in Moscow's Arctic planning,
it is evident that [the Russian government is **counting on** the
creation of a wider **alternative** Arctic regime.]{.underline}

Despite lofty declarations of mutual interests in the Arctic, [[there
have been **significant cracks**]{.mark} in this regional
relationship]{.underline}. These include [ongoing [concerns about
**demographic stresses**]{.mark} between Russia's depopulated Arctic
territories]{.underline} and adjacent Chinese provinces. In addition, in
2020 [a Russian Arctic [researcher]{.mark} was [accused of
**spying**]{.mark}]{.underline} for Beijing, [[and]{.mark} overall there
has been **[little]{.mark} movement** [beyond **rhetoric**]{.mark} on
further joint research]{.underline} initiatives between the two states.

Another telling sign of trouble was the release of an official standard
Chinese map in August last year, which designated an island shared by
the two powers, Bolshoi Ussuriysky (Heixiazi Island in Chinese), as
wholly belonging to China. The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources had
also decreed in February 2023 that its own maps of the Russian Far East
be changed to use traditional Chinese names of Russian cities like
Vladivostok. [These moves **must** also **be considered** when
discussing the robustness of Sino-Russian Arctic
cooperation.]{.underline}

[The **underlying question** is whether there is]{.underline} a
threshold degree of [**trust** between China and Russia to allow for a
**deepening** of Arctic **cooperation**]{.underline}. Both countries
have engaged in joint military operations in and near the Arctic, such
as off the coast of Alaska in August of last year, but [[it remains
**unclear**]{.mark} as to [whether]{.mark} these [displays]{.mark} have
[served **any purpose** beyond a **show**]{.mark} of unity versus the
West. The signing of a **bilateral** coast guard
**agreement**]{.underline} in Murmansk, near the Finnish border, [was
**symbolic**]{.underline}, but there has been little sign that Russia
will significantly yield its coveted Arctic maritime space to Chinese
vessels.

The **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n government [[remains
**concerned** about China's]{.mark} longer-term [goals]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, especially as the power gap between the two states
continues to widen. [[Beijing **worries** about]{.mark} being too
dependent upon [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially since the future
of that country remains cloudy, at best. [[The]{.mark} 1969 Sino-Soviet
[border war has]{.mark} likely [**not** been **forgotten**]{.mark} by
either power, and remains a **cautionary tale**]{.underline} for both
states about the dangers of, to use the Maoist-era phrase, "leaning to
one side" too much.

While the far-northern strategies of Beijing and Moscow need to be
carefully analyzed, presuming that the two states are in lockstep with
their regional policies creates a distorted strategic picture at a time
when clarity about Arctic security is desperately needed.

Russian nuclear threats against Ukraine are not credible

The [[fear that Russia might use]{.mark} 'tactical' [**nuclear weapons**
in **Ukraine**]{.mark} reflects a fundamental]{.underline}, but
completely understandable, [**misinterpretation** of what Putin has
said]{.underline} (attempting to deter direct Western
intervention) [and how Russia thinks about nuclear weapons in
war]{.underline}. While it is tempting to believe that Russia's latest
nuclear threats are directed against Ukraine, it is worth noting that,
on the one hand, [Russia has annexed territory it does not currently
hold, and on the other, Putin has **refrained** from issuing a
direct nuclear threat to Ukraine if it did not take up his offer for
talks]{.underline}. Rather, [his messaging was intended to **push the
West** to coerce Ukraine into **negotiations** and to freeze the
battlefield]{.underline} as it is now, which would give Russia time and
space to reconstitute its land forces. If Russia's threat against
Ukraine had been serious, surely the raid on Belgorod, the attack on
Saky Air Base or the bombing of the Kerch Bridge -- in addition to the
regular fighting proceeding along the front lines -- would have been
sufficient to trigger retaliation.

But [such concerns [are not
consistent with Russian **nuclear doctrine** and **force posture**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Russia's operational nuclear doctrine (as opposed to the published
version) focuses on
employment against the possibility of a small nuclear conflict
escalating to a theatre or general war, and the force posture of
Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal reflects that mission. Russia
sees non-strategic nuclear use in such escalation-prevention
scenarios -- as well as near-peer theatre-level conflicts -- as a
prescribed 'dose' of violence to 'soberise' the adversary, prevent
it from escalating or coerce it into capitulating. Thus, [[it
is **highly unlikely**]{.mark} that Russia would use nuclear
weapons against Ukrainian targets in this war]{.underline}. It may be
helpful to illustrate the underlying principles of this conclusion by
thinking about tactical nuclear weapon use. This is not to say that
doctrine is determinative, given that in this war Putin has acted in
ways contrary to any rational military doctrine. But most analysts
expect that he would only use nuclear weapons in Ukraine if he something
to gain from doing so.

In order to use tactical nuclear weapons in the current conflict, Russia
would have to answer four questions:

1\) What is the intended target of a nuclear strike?

2\) What is the intended effect on the target?

3\) What type of nuclear weapon would create the intended effect with
the highest efficiency?

4\) What happens next?

As Hoffman and I argued in April, [there are three types of potential
uses for Russian nuclear weapons in its war on Ukraine: 1)
a **demonstration strike**]{.underline} against an unpopulated area such
as the Black Sea; [2) a **counter-force battlefield strike**; and 3)
a **counter-value strike**]{.underline} against a population centre to
seek a political termination of the war, or possible to decapitate
Ukraine's government. [Scenarios 1 and 3 are **vanishingly unlikely**,
as 1 would probably have no effect on Ukraine's will to fight or on
Western support for Ukraine but would give rise to massive global
political opprobrium]{.underline}. Scenario 3 would obviously increase
Ukraine's will to fight and it would also increase global support for
Ukraine's struggle and make Russia and Putin himself a target for defeat
for a massive coalition of countries including states that are currently
neutral or even supportive of the war effort. And, for all three of
these scenarios, the question of what happens next looms. If scenarios 1
and 3 do not end the conflict on Russia's terms, Moscow might well be on
the receiving end of political, economic, and possibly even military
retaliation.

[This leaves scenario 2]{.underline}. Put simply, [however, [there
are **no attractive military targets** for Russian nuclear weapons in
Ukraine]{.mark}. Ukraine does not operate with a large-enough
concentration of forces to justify a 10--100 kiloton blast]{.underline}.
Smaller nuclear weapons would be of even less use, as below 10 kilotons,
their effects are overtaken by those of high-end precision mass-effect
artillery, such as the Tornado-G and -S and the TOS-1M/1A and TOS-2,
especially when using thermobaric warheads. As Janne Korhonen describes
in an excellent Twitter thread, tactical nuclear weapons are far less
decisive in their effects than one might think, and conventional
artillery strikes such as the one at Zelenopillya in July 2014
demonstrate similar levels of effectiveness in combat without breaching
the nuclear taboo, risking global opprobrium, unleashing dangerous
radioactive fallout, or demoralising the soldiers on one's own side. So
Putin has two bad nuclear options before him: either employ multiple
small warheads to achieve a significant battlefield effect (with a real
threat of intervention and escalation), or employ one larger, theatre
nuclear weapon to achieve a political effect (and still risk
intervention and escalation).

[Defeating the Ukrainian army on the battlefield
would require **dozens** of tactical nuclear weapons to achieve
a **decisive military effect**]{.underline} -- not just a single strike.
In fact, the US Army planned to use 136 nuclear strikes to achieve a
decisive result over a 60-mile-long front -- and the frontlines between
Ukraine and Russia now stretch for almost 400 miles. [[The **risks
of radiation**]{.mark} from this many strikes, not to mention
the psychological effects [on Russian soldiers]{.mark} of witnessing
destruction on such a scale, [would
be considerable]{.mark}]{.underline}, reducing their combat
effectiveness and their already-low ability to exploit gaps in Ukrainian
defensive lines. The radiation effects are not to be ignored, with
immediate effects on all soldiers in the open regardless of their
loyalty, as well as [[the]{.underline} [**spread of fallout** into
**occupied Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and into [**Belarus** and
**Russia**]{.mark}, which [would cause panic]{.mark} among
populations]{.underline} already made wary by Ukraine's strikes in
Russia and occupied Crimea. Further, if the intent is to break Ukraine's
will or the West's resolve, any such strikes would fail
utterly. [Breaking the 77-year taboo on [nuclear use]{.mark} in war
[would]{.mark} only **[galvanise]{.mark}** Ukraine and [the
West's **support**]{.mark} for it [while **rallying more
countries**]{.mark} to the cause]{.underline}.

[[No signs]{.underline}]{.mark} yet [[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} the
bulk of [[Russia]{.mark}n [nuclear forces]{.mark} actually are
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[high alert]{.underline}]{.mark}** as part
of Moscow's "special regime of combat duty." But what's clear is that
Putin's televised order last week was designed to tell the United
States, NATO, and the West to desist from supporting Ukraine---or risk
unimaginable consequences. While Washington and its allies have been
right to avoid overreaction so far, Putin will likely continue his
nuclear saber-rattling, and there is still a risk that he would use
nuclear forces in Ukraine.

Although the announcement was an alarming development, it was also
foreseeable[. Nuclear signaling is a key part of Russia's military
strategy]{.underline} [and]{.underline} its [self-image]{.underline} as
a world power. That the Kremlin is now showing signs of implementing its
so-called escalate-to-deescalate strategy should come as no surprise to
those familiar with Russian doctrine. [The West must recognize this for
what it is]{.underline}: a form of [nuclear blackmail]{.underline} to
which the United States and its allies should not capitulate.

[For years]{.underline}, [Moscow]{.underline} has [made nuclear weapons
a centerpiece of]{.underline} its military [doctrine]{.underline}. In
the event of a major war, the Russian Federation has signaled its
willingness to threaten a "deescalatory" nuclear attack to achieve its
objectives. To that end, Putin has made it clear during crises that he
might threaten (or, in extreme cases, execute) an early nonstrategic
nuclear strike---hoping to end the confrontation on terms favorable to
the Kremlin.

Unlike the United States, Russia has signaled willingness to take this
step even if the crisis is of its own making. At the heart of this
strategy is Russia's arsenal of tactical, battlefield-ready nuclear
warheads. Even more concerning, these Russian weapons outnumber the
United States' arsenal of similar weapons by a magnitude of almost ten
to one.

Deterrence and dramatic moves

[[This level of]{.mark} nuclear [posturing has been visible in the
past]{.mark}]{.underline}. [During]{.underline} the
[[2014]{.underline}]{.mark} invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea,
[[Putin]{.mark} [bragged]{.mark}]{.underline} that [he wanted to remind
Russians]{.underline} (and, by extension, the West) that "[[Russia
is]{.mark} one of [the leading]{.mark} nuclear
[power]{.mark}s]{.underline}," and "it's best not to mess with us."
Although he never raised the nuclear alert, he later said he'd
considered doing so.

[Most likely]{.underline}, this [heightened]{.underline} state of
[readiness]{.underline}---just like Putin's explicit threats in his
pre-invasion speech and the recent exercises of Russia's strategic
forces---[is designed to deter NATO]{.underline} from direct
intervention in Ukraine. [Both [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [have [show]{.mark}n]{.underline}
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[desire to enter]{.mark} the
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} directly, and Putin's statement about a
Russian nuclear alert is designed to make sure it stays that way.

[[Putin]{.mark} issued nuclear threats because he has been [surprised
by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[strength]{.underline}]{.mark} and unity
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the US and NATO
[response]{.mark}]{.underline} [and [frustrated with
Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[slow]{.underline}]{.mark}er-than-expected [military
[advance]{.mark}]{.underline}. With these nuclear threats, he is trying
to sow divisions within the Alliance and get the White House to back
off. But [Western moves to assist Ukraine have been
dramatic]{.underline}. [Germany]{.underline} has [pledged to
increase]{.underline} its [defense spending]{.underline} by one hundred
billion euros and, despite a previous ban on shipments of arms to an
active war zone, Germany has, along with other [European Union
members]{.underline}, [announced weapons shipments]{.underline}. Even
[Turkey]{.underline}, which had previously shown reluctance to limit
Russian movement through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits,
[is]{.underline} now [willing to close]{.underline} the [passages
to]{.underline} some [Russian warships]{.underline}.

Putin might be betting that actions speak louder than words, and that a
nuclear alert could more effectively scare Western leaders into cutting
their support for Ukraine. Despite this nuclear blackmail, NATO should
continue to ~~stand~~ strong. [[Putin does]{.underline}]{.mark} [[not
want]{.mark} to fight a]{.underline} **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with the United States [any more
than]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates wants to fight a
nuclear war with Russia]{.underline}. The United States is a nuclear
superpower, and a [[nuclear exchange]{.mark} with the Pentagon would
[result in]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[unacceptable]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[consequences]{.mark} for Putin]{.underline}. Asked if the West should
worry about the possibility of a nuclear war, US President Joe Biden
answered with an intelligent and resolute, "no." [US Strategic
Command]{.underline} [echoed this]{.underline} sentiment, stating that
[the United States remains at]{.underline} an "[appropriate
posture]{.underline}" [to deter Russia]{.underline}.

Danger signs

Still, it's important to take these threats seriously. Typically,
Russia's tactical nuclear warheads are kept in centralized storage and
warheads are not deployed on strategic bombers. This enhanced readiness
alert could allow Russian forces to take steps such as mating their
warheads to their bombers or the short- and medium-range missiles that
have already been deployed close to the frontlines (such as the
short-range SS-26 ballistic missiles or the medium-range S-400 air
defense systems, both of which are dual-capable).

Last week's alert could also lead to some strategic delivery
systems---such as ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs) or mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)---being deployed or
dispersed. SSBNs, which are nuclear-powered, can be flushed out of port
into the open ocean; mobile ICBMs can drive away from their sheltered
garrisons and move around Russia's large landmass. Reports this week of
Russian exercises involving submarine and mobile ICBM deployments fit
this pattern. Still, these exercises are short of a full mobilization of
Russia's nuclear forces.

Game of chicken?

Yet [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the [incendiary
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} from Putin this weekend, [[Moscow has not
shown]{.mark} major [indications]{.mark} of moving in this
direction]{.underline}. On Monday, a senior US Department of Defense
official noted that there have not been any "noticeable muscle
movements" that would indicate a heightened combat readiness for
Russia's nuclear forces, and this week's exercises do not completely
change that picture. Though the United States and its allies should
continue to carefully monitor such measures, they should see these
threats for what they are---part of Putin's pattern, as White House
Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, of "manufacturing threats that don't
exist."

To be sure, if Putin finds himself in an increasingly desperate wartime
situation, he may consider the use of low-yield nuclear weapons on the
battlefield in Ukraine to reverse his losses. Washington should begin
developing a plan to deter this kind of attack in close consultation
with NATO allies.

But, at this early stage of the war, [[Putin's]{.mark} nuclear alert
is]{.underline} almost certainly **[[an elaborate
bluff]{.underline}]{.mark}** [meant to scare the United
States]{.underline} and its allies and partners. They should not give
him the satisfaction. Instead, the West should remain resolute in its
efforts to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.

insist the U.S. and NATO must militarily intervene in the war in
Ukraine. The head of the European Council on Foreign Relations openly
called for regime change in Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky called on NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea
former National Security Adviser John Bolton partially endorsed. A
no-fly zone, of course, would involve NATO aircraft shooting down
Russian warplanes over Ukrainian skies. [To [put]{.mark} it]{.underline}

[Treating the war as if it were]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}**
[World War III]{.underline}, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine a prelude

**[unnecessary]{.underline}** [because [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}

actual [**[capabilities]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[severely [bounded]{.mark}]{.underline}** by reality.

[[The **German**]{.underline} [military]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} **[1940]{.underline}**, as its blitzkrieg swept across
Europe, [[numbered]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[6 million]{.underline}**
soldiers in all branches. [Over the course of the war, some]{.underline}
**[[18 million]{.mark} Germans served]{.underline}** in uniform,
[approaching]{.underline} [**one-third of its total population**.
Germany was the]{.underline} economic **[powerhouse of
Europe]{.underline}** in 1940 and could outproduce any European
competitor in military equipment and supplies.

[At the start of the war, the Germans]{.underline} arguably [[had
the]{.underline} **[best tank]{.underline}**]{.mark} (the Panzer)
[[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[best [fighter]{.mark}]{.underline}**
plane (the Messerschmitt). [The German scientific and industrial base
was among the best in Europe and had a head start in its focus on
military technology. German military scientists invented the jet,
rocket, cruise missile, and helicopter before any of the Allies. And the
German military was infamous---again, at the beginning of the war---for
its extraordinary training, discipline, and cohesion.]{.underline}

**[[None]{.mark} of that is [true of Russia]{.mark} or the Russian
military]{.underline}** today. [The Russian military [has]{.mark}
about]{.underline} **[[1 million]{.underline}]{.mark}** active-duty

of its conquests. Russia **[could]{.underline}** [call up]{.underline}

[Over the past week, the Russian military [has

**[clearly struggled]{.underline}** [when faced with a]{.underline}

a situation, [under Russian policy,
that warrants]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [use]{.underline} [of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. He
has reshuffled his military leadership accordingly, assigning the three
generals responsible for employment of tactical nuclear weapons to
command his "special military operation" in Ukraine.
[[He]{.mark} already [has tactical reasons]{.mark} to explode a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}: [saving Russian soldiers'
lives]{.underline}, **[[shortening the
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [destroying Ukrainian forces. He also
has strategic reasons: rejuvenating the deterrent value of his nuclear
arsenal and proving that he is not a bluffer]{.underline}.

[Putin's]{.underline} [threats]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [included]{.underline} [both]{.underline} [strategic]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline},
which can reach the United
States, [and]{.underline} [tactical]{.underline} nuclear weapons, which
are generally smaller in explosive power and could be launched from
shorter distances to strike Ukraine.
His [threats]{.underline} [include]{.underline} [preemptive]{.underline} [strikes]{.underline} [against
those who threaten the survival of Russia]{.underline}. Unlike Ukraine,
the [[U.S. and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [have]{.underline} their own
nuclear weapons to deter a Russian strike. But they
have [[made]{.underline} [it]{.underline} [clear]{.underline} [they will
not]{.underline}]{.mark} [use]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [[defend]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This
[leaves Ukraine **especially vulnerable**]{.mark} **to nuclear
attack**.]{.underline}

[Many Western [experts say]{.mark} they take [the threat of a Russian
nuclear strike in Ukraine serious]{.mark}ly but **make
the mistake of asserting that the odds are low**.]{.underline} The
result is that many officials view the problem of tactical nuclear
weapons as serious but not urgent. Earlier this month, U.S. Director of
National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate hearing that Putin\'s
weakened conventional force would make him more reliant on \"asymmetric
options,\" including nuclear capabilities, for deterrence, but that it
was \"very unlikely\" that Moscow would use nuclear weapons in its war
against Ukraine. Speaking at the same hearing, the director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, also assessed the
chances as \"unlikely.\"

In
fact, [the]{.underline} [evidence]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [strong]{.underline} [that
the]{.underline} [problem]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [urgent]{.underline} and
I argue that [Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon in his war in
Ukraine]{.underline}. [Western leaders need not wonder about Putin\'s
nuclear-use red lines and how to avoid crossing them while supporting
Ukraine]{.underline}, in my
view. [Putin]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [waiting]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [misstep]{.underline} [by
the West.]{.underline} He has been building the conditions for nuclear
use in Ukraine since early in the war and is ready to use a nuclear
weapon whenever he decides, most likely in response to his faltering
military\'s inability to escalate as much as he wishes by conventional
means. This article will not consider exhaustively what may prompt
Putin\'s decision, but we should not fool ourselves by thinking we can
prevent it. Instead, we should prepare responses for a new world in
which the nuclear genie is out of the bottle.

Russia's Increased Reliance on Nuclear Weapons

For much of the past 80 years, Russia's security has rested on two
pillars whose relative strength has waxed and waned --- its conventional
ground forces and its nuclear weapons. The conventional forces have been
used to influence, bully and force Russia's neighbors and adversaries to
bend to its will. The nuclear forces were intended to deter the United
States and the West from interfering militarily in Russia and its
perceived zone of influence. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia's
conventional forces have at times struggled with their share of the
task. To compensate, Russian leaders have had to rely on their nuclear
forces to do both: strategic nuclear weapons to deter the West and
tactical nuclear weapons to threaten neighbors.

In today\'s situation, [[a single]{.mark} nuclear [strike]{.mark} in
Ukraine [could thwart a Ukrainian counterattack with little loss of
Russian lives]{.mark}. For Moscow, this consideration is as
much **practical** as it is moral or image-related]{.underline}: Last
year\'s large-scale mobilization and increase in military units showed
that Putin\'s army was too small for its task. Nevertheless, Russia has
managed to create only a few new battalions because most new personnel
and equipment went to replace losses in existing units. Putin and his
military leaders are running out of the people and materiel needed to
achieve his goals.

Russian military and security experts have been noting this greater
reliance on nuclear weapons for years. In 2000, responding to the U.S.
bombing of former Yugoslavia, Russian international affairs expert and
former lawmaker Alexey Arbatov described how Moscow's response could be
"to enhance its nuclear forces to deter not just nuclear, but also,
large--scale conventional attacks of the type demonstrated in the
Balkans." He likewise described a view some say Putin has embraced: that
"a suicidal threat of nuclear escalation could present a credible
deterrent against a full-scale, theater-wide conventional aggression ---
including major ground warfare."

Putin Prepares for a Nuclear Strike

In the first three months of 2023, Putin took several public steps to
demonstrate that he is not bluffing about the use of nuclear weapons.

In February, he signed a law "suspending" Russia's participation in the
strategic nuclear arms treaty New START. This step
officially ended joint inspections of American and Russian
nuclear weapons sites and released Russia from limiting its number of
strategic nuclear weapons, Russian promises to remain limited
notwithstanding.

In March, Putin announced that he
would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus this year, building a
storage facility to house them, to be completed as early as July. Since
Russia has already deployed nuclear-capable Iskander ground-launched
missile systems and thousands of troops to Belarus, this would put
nuclear delivery systems and warheads in close proximity to one another,
greatly reducing the warning time of their use. Putin noted that Russian
trainers would also train Belarussian forces to use the weapons. Analyst
Dmitri Trenin, former director of the now-defunct Carnegie Moscow Center
and a retired Soviet military officer, observed that the Belarus
deployment "demonstrates that the conflict between Russia and the West
is developing into an armed clash between Russia and NATO, and is a
signal to Washington that further American/Western involvement in the
military conflict in Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons."

Putin has taken these increasingly threatening steps in the belief that
NATO and the West --- in particular, the United States --- are not
listening to him as he proclaims Russia's demands on the international
stage. In 2018, when Putin unveiled a bevy of new nuclear weapons, he
warned: "You will listen to us now!" Four years later, his invasion of
Ukraine was a wakeup call for those in the West who were still not
listening.

Even after the invasion though, some in Russia undoubtedly fear that the
threat of a nuclear strike has begun to ring hollow. For Putin, whose
regime is at risk, in my view, continuing to threaten a tactical nuclear
attack in Ukraine without doing it carries perhaps as much risk as doing
it. To remind the West of the destructive power of a nuclear weapon,
Putin and his generals may decide it is necessary to explode such a
weapon. This would enable Russia to escalate the war to its tactical
advantage and let Putin prove he is no bluffer.

[Besides warning the West many times that he might use a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}, [Putin and his leadership have, step by
step, prepared the Russian people with reasons why he should use nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[[Among]{.mark} these [justifications, Putin has repeatedly
invoked]{.mark} \"whataboutist\" **[comparisons to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**. When announcing plans for deployment
of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus]{.underline} on Russian state
television, [[he said: \"The United States
has been doing this for **decades**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They have long
... deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their
allied countries, NATO countries, in Europe, in six states. ... [[We are
going to **do the same thing**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Putin has also
several times referenced American nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki and equated American goals then --- to save soldiers' lives and
shorten the war --- with Russian goals today.

[Putin has also made clear to the Russian people
that **Moscow\'s red lines** for the use of nuclear weapons, spelled out
in its official documents, **have all been crossed** in the
conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}. These include "aggression with
conventional weapons against the Russian Federation, when the very
existence of the state is threatened." Putin has repeatedly claimed that
the very survival of Russia is at stake in the current struggle. At this
month\'s Victory Day parade, he claimed that the West's "goal is to
achieve the collapse and destruction of our country." He asserts that
Crimea and other Ukrainian lands are Russian territory, meaning that,
from Putin's perspective, battles that were occurring on Ukrainian land
one day are suddenly happening on Russian land. Another of Russia\'s
officially designated red lines for nuclear use is "attacks ... against
critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation,
disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces\' response actions."
Russia has claimed that Ukrainian drones have struck Russian strategic
nuclear bombers inside Russia, and that Ukraine and the U.S. are
responsible for drones launched to assassinate Putin. All
these claims, real and fabricated, are used
to establish the pretext for Putin to use nuclear weapons when he
decides.

Some Western observers of the Russian military claim that because we
have not yet seen any movement of nuclear weapons, we have no tangible
signs of intent to use them. I disagree.

First of all, last fall, Kyiv officials reported that Russia was
firing "Kh-55 nuclear cruise missiles" with dummy warheads. Observers
suggested these missiles --- which are designed to carry only a nuclear
weapon --- were launched to erode Ukrainian air defenses by \"decoying\"
them into destroying the Kh-55s rather than missiles with conventional
explosives. This claim makes little sense: Missiles, even unarmed, would
be too valuable to shorthanded Russia to use as decoys. But launching
the Cold War-era missiles with dummy warheads to test their reliability
and readiness for use in a real nuclear strike would be a good reason
for what we saw.

Another sign of Russia's increasing readiness to use nuclear weapons is
the most recent change in the leadership of the war, which both
underscores Putin\'s message that Russia is fighting for its survival
and puts at the helm the very men who are in charge of Russia\'s
tactical nuclear weapons. In January, Putin appointed his chief of
the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, to head the military operation in
Ukraine. (Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the change was connected
to a coming "expansion in the scope of \[the war's\] tasks.") Not since
the second world war has the chief of the general staff been in command
of a military operation for Russia. Putin also appointed two generals to
be Gerasimov's main deputies in the war, Gen. Oleg Salyukov, head of
Russia's ground forces, and Gen. Sergei Surovikin, head of Russia's
aerospace forces. This is even more worrisome since, under Russian
doctrine, the chief of the general staff and the heads of the ground and
aerospace forces are the three officers who control all tactical nuclear
weapons use in ground operations. Putin has now placed in direct control
of the war the three senior-most officers who have the authority to
employ tactical nuclear weapons when he gives the order.

When these developments are coupled with the impending deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, nearer Ukraine, we can no longer
pretend there are no tangible signs of intent.

Trigger for Nuclear Use

With the groundwork laid to justify a tactical nuclear strike in
Ukraine, what will trigger Putin's decision to launch? Most likely it
will be the inability of the Russian military to escalate the war by
conventional means when Putin demands. For example, if a Ukrainian
offensive threatens the loss of Crimea or the provinces that form the
land bridge to it, Putin would demand an escalation of the fighting to
prevent that loss. If the conventional forces could not successfully
respond, however, a nuclear strike against the Ukrainian forces would be
the only way to escalate. On the night Putin illegally added four
Ukrainian provinces to Russia, he declared, "If the territorial unity of
our country is threatened, in order to protect Russia and our nation, we
will unquestionably use all the weapons we have. This is no bluff."

Putin is also under pressure to escalate the
war from Russian nationalists. These groups have supported Putin in
his rise to power, but now are vocal in their dissatisfaction with the
conduct of the war. Some, like former FSB officer Igor Girkin, openly
criticize the senior military leadership and even Putin. That criticism
may be morphing into opposition, forcing Putin to consider escalating
his war before his conventional forces are ready.

Claims that Putin would be dissuaded from using nuclear weapons by
important partners like China or India are belied by experience thus far
in the war. Although Putin values the support of others, he has not
shied from putting that support at risk to get what he wants.

None of this is to say that we in the West should pressure Ukraine to
forgo its goal to liberate all seized territory. But it does mean that
we should anticipate a nuclear weapon will be used and develop our
possible responses accordingly.

Normalizing Nuclear Weapons

[As]{.underline} [soon as Russia uses a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the
"fallout" will begin and spread]{.underline}. Tens of thousands of
Ukrainians will be dead, suffering or dealing with the effects of the
nuclear explosion. [Hundreds of millions of Europeans will be bracing
for war]{.underline}. But 7 billion others around the globe will go
about their business, alarmed to be sure, but physically unaffected by a
nuclear explosion in Ukraine. [This last [outcome of a Russian]{.mark}
tactical [nuclear strike]{.mark} may ultimately be
the]{.underline} [most]{.underline} [dangerous]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [international]{.underline} [order.
The image that many people have of nuclear arms as civilization-ending
weapons will be erased. In its place, [people will see these weapons as
**normal** and]{.mark}, although tragic, **[acceptable in
war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Just a "bigger bullet." It is in this
dramatically changed context that the United States will have to decide
how to respond.

### Yes Nuclear Ukraine\-\--Russia Winning

#### Russia [winning]{.underline} in [Ukraine]{.underline} goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

But has the international community overlooked another scenario---a
situation in which Russian nuclear use might not only be possible but
even more likely? [What if [Russia resorts to **nuclear use**]{.mark}
not when it's losing---but [when it's **winning**]{.mark} the
war?]{.underline}

The nuclear calculus, then and now. Much is still unknown about Russian
deliberations two years ago, and what ultimately worked to dissuade
Russia from using nuclear weapons then. Likely, it was some combination
of US threat of game-changing consequences for Russia, including
conventional strikes against Russian military assets on occupied
Ukrainian territory, intervention by China that might have come with a
promise of increased conventional military assistance, and the dubious
military utility of battlefield nuclear use. The nuclear use Russia
considered in the fall of 2022 would have been well beyond the pale of
Russia's nuclear doctrine, before and after the announced changes. That
reality points to the limited restraint a declaratory doctrine is likely
to impose on considerations of whether to use nuclear weapons in a war.

Fears of nuclear escalation remain real, and Ukraine's Western partners
continue to carefully consider escalation dynamics when they decide
which weapon systems to release to Ukraine and how to mandate their end
use. The current reticence to allow Ukraine to strike Russian homeland
with Western-supplied weapons is a case in point. The underlying
operating assumption is that Ukraine cannot be too audacious in its
resistance, lest it provokes Russia's nuclear ire.

But what are the nuclear risks of the opposite scenario: when the
conventional fighting in Ukraine shifts decisively in Russia's favor?

[Consider that [the **only** use of nuclear weapons]{.mark} in armed
conflict so far [was by a nuclear power]{.mark} that was [on
a **winning path**]{.mark}. [The **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**
decided to drop two atomic bombs on **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** in
August 1945, when Japan was nearly defeated by conventional means, but
stubbornly refused to stop resistance and accept US conditions for
surrender]{.underline}. While reasons and justifications for the US
decision to employ nuclear weapons in Japan are still subject of debate
among historians, it is safe to say that the bombings achieved at least
three goals. They terminated the war with Japan more quickly, possibly
saving the United States from having to mount a costly invasion of the
home islands. They allowed the United States to impose the conditions of
war termination and post-war settlement---that is, unconditional
surrender and US military occupation of Japan. And finally, they made a
strong impression on the Soviet Union.

While historical precedents should not be applied uncritically across
time and context, they can be mined for insights. [[The **set
of incentives** for Russia to resort to nuclear use when it is about to
win in Ukraine
would]{.mark} not [be]{.mark} **dis[similar]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
those animating the US decision in 1945. Perhaps, Putin's mention of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki precedents in his September 2022 speech was more
than a trope.

[[A winning Russia]{.mark} might indeed [have **more to
gain** and **less to lose**]{.mark} from a nuclear
strike]{.underline} than a retreating Russia.

The possible nuclear scenario, if Russia is winning. [Imagine Russia has
broken through Ukraine's defensive lines and is steadily pushing against
stubborn]{.underline} if desperate pockets of
Ukrainian [resistance]{.underline}---a scenario that today looks far
more likely than the sudden routing of Russian troops from Ukraine. With
victory in sight but not yet in hand, [it would
be]{.underline} mighty [tempting for Russia to launch a
**nuclear-armed missile** on a secondary Ukrainian city and demand
Ukraine's]{.underline} immediate and unconditional [surrender or else
another major city would be next.]{.underline}

[[Continued resistance]{.mark} from Kyiv [would be suddenly]{.mark}
rendered **[foolhardy]{.mark}**, if not suicidal. In this scenario, [the
Kremlin could **terminate the
war**]{.mark} more [quickly]{.mark}, with fewer casualties, and [on
**conditions favorable to Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It could impose
on Ukraine unconditional surrender, occupation, and other punishing
conditions it would feel entitled to after a long and costly war. The
prospect of lording over a smoldering radioactive ruin would unlikely be
an obstacle for Russia. The wanton destruction of Mariupol, Bakhmut,
Avdiivka, Marinka, and other Ukrainian
cities by the Russian artillery and bombs before Russia occupied
them resembles what could be achieved by a
single non-strategic nuclear missile, minus efficiency and
radioactivity. And after all, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were rebuilt
in just a few years and are perfectly habitable today.

Russia would still likely incur international political costs for
breaking the eight-decades-long taboo on nuclear use, [but these
**[costs]{.mark}** could be [better **mitigated** by a **winning
Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} than a losing Russia. [The
United States and NATO allies might not deliver on their threat to
impose severe military costs in response to a Russian nuclear strike if
Ukraine looks like a lost cause]{.underline}. [Opprobrium from **China**
will **matter less** to a Russia that **won** its war in
Europe]{.underline}. Finally, Russia's nuclear use is bound to make an
impression in NATO capitals and allow Russia to shape the broader
post-war settlement in Europe to its advantage.

As long as nuclear weapons exist, their use remains possible. In times
of crisis and conflict, their use becomes more probable. Kremlin's heavy
reliance on nuclear rhetoric for political coercion since February 2022
should not obscure the very real danger that Russia might resort to an
actual nuclear strike on battlefield Ukraine. As Western capitals
balance their support for Ukraine with fears of nuclear escalation, they
should bear in mind that [[**allowing** Russia to achieve significant
**military advantage** in Ukraine]{.mark} might [create **greater risk
of nuclear**]{.mark}** weapons [use]{.mark}**]{.underline} than Russia's
retreat.

Some extreme possibilities associated with high temperature and CO 2
emission scenarios have yet to be ruled out; for example, a recent model
predicted stratocumulus cloud break-up in 1300 ppm scenarios leading to
an additional 8 °C rise, although the authors note substantial
uncertainties remain (Schneider et al., 2019). [[The potential for
**climate change** to bring about]{.mark} outcomes as severe as [human
**extinction** or]{.mark} civilisational [**collapse** remains the
subject of]{.mark} academic **[debate]{.mark}**. **Ord** (2020) and
**MacAskill** (2022)5 conclude that [the **direct risk of human
extinction** from climate change appears **very
low**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kemp et al. (2022) argue that potential
worst-case outcomes for climate change, including global catastrophe or
human extinction, remain "dangerously unexplored," highlighting that in
addition to direct impacts, climate change may exacerbate other global
threats.

Climate change is exacerbating ongoing anthropogenic biodiversity loss
and environmental degradation. Other drivers of biodiversity loss
include habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution and
overexploitation of species and resources (IPBES, 2019). Dasgupta (2021)
reviews the extensive dependence of human society on ecosystem services;
[substantial global harm is to be expected from the degradation of these
services, although a **direct path** to human **extinction** is **not
outlined**]{.underline}. Surveying the literature Kareiva and Carranza
(2018) [note a "growing scepticism regarding the strength of evidence
linking trends in biodiversity loss to an existential risk for humans,"
arguing that in the absence of unlikely circumstances such as 90% of
biodiversity being lost, human civilisation would survive]{.underline}.
Ord (2020) argues that ongoing environmental damage is a source of
unknown threats to humanity and that more research is needed.

Under scenarios of unsustainable anthropogenic activity, widescale
pollution, resource depletion, soil erosion, deforestation and other
consequences of [[human activity may make]{.mark} global
[civilisation]{.mark} considerably [**less resilient**, but a direct
link to **full extinction appears implausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Concerns have been raised about the widespread release of chemicals that
may be harmful to human health; in particular endocrine disruptors,
which have been linked to fertility decline (Gonsioroski et al., 2020;
Swan and Colino, 2022). While it is premature to consider these
extinction threats, more research is needed on their impacts on
populations and reproductive health. Conversely, concerns have been
raised for half a century that rising global population might lead to
civilisational collapse (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 2009); however, research
increasingly suggests that global population will peak and begin to
decline within this century (Adam, 2021).

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- **[climate
catastrophists]{.underline}** will often **[turn to [dire
predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}** about prospective climate phenomena.
**[The problem]{.underline}** with such predictions **[is]{.underline}**
that **[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate
[models driven by highly complex]{.mark} sets of [assumptions]{.mark}
about which there is significant dispute. Worse, these models are
[notorious for failing]{.mark} to accurately predict already documented
changes in climate]{.underline}**. As climatologist Patrick Michaels of
the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

**[[During all periods]{.underline}]{.mark}** from 10 years (2006-2015)
to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, **[the [observed temp]{.mark}erature
trend [lies in the]{.mark} lower half of]{.underline}** the collection
of **[climate model simulations, and for several periods it lies very
close]{.underline}** (or even below) **[the [2.5th percentile]{.mark} of
all the model runs]{.underline}**. Over shorter periods, such as the
last two decades, a plethora of mechanisms have been put forth to
explain the observed/modeled divergence, but none do so completely and
many of the explanations are inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that **[almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline}** incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- **[[overstate]{.mark} past
and current temperature [trends by a factor of]{.mark} two to
[three]{.mark}, and at times even more]{.underline}**. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, **[every]{.underline}** CMIP **[climate
model predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gas should create an enhanced heating effect
in]{.underline}** the mid-troposphere **[over the
tropics]{.underline}** --- that is, at an altitude over the tropics of
about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying climatology is simple: Most of
the tropics is ocean, and as increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations
warm the Earth slightly, there should be an increase in the evaporation
of ocean water in this region. When the water vapor rises into the
mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing heat. And **[yet]{.underline}**
the **[satellites cannot find this heating effect --- a reality
suggesting that our understanding of climate and atmospheric phenomena
is not as robust as many seem to assume]{.underline}**.

**[The [poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark} of mainstream climate
models [is exacerbated by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC and
U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} highly [unrealistic]{.mark}
future [increases]{.mark} in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}**. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. **[The [average]{.mark}]{.underline}** annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** under RCP8.5 **[[is]{.mark} over
[five times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline}** for
2000-2019 **[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}**. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the
Georgia Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as

#### Biodiversity loss won't cause extinction

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and
[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss are ethical]{.mark} and spiritual
[losses]{.mark}, but perhaps [not an existential
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[WHAT]{.underline} IS THE [**EVIDENCE** OF]{.underline} CURRENT [DAMAGE
DUE TO CO2 OR **GLOBAL WARMING**?]{.underline}

Currently [it is [very hard to **find**]{.mark} any unusual **weather**
or **[weather-related disaster]{.mark}** that can be [blamed on
**climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether natural or
human-caused, [despite constant news media claims to the
contrary]{.underline}. AR6 can only point to an increase in heat
waves.28 [Weather-related **disasters** occur every year. But the trends
in the cost, as a fraction of **GDP**, or **human suffering** and death
due to them are, respectively, flat or rapidly declining]{.underline} as
explained by Roger Pielke Jr.29 and Bjorn Lomborg.30

Globally, [[most damage]{.underline}]{.mark} (around 90%) [from extreme
weather by far is [due to **flooding** and]{.mark} severe
**[storms]{.mark}**, such as **tropical cyclones**.]{.underline}31 The
most [damaging extremes, **hurricanes**, floods, and (weather-related)
droughts [have not **changed** globally]{.mark} on **climatic time
scales** (\>30 years).]{.underline}32 The [[earth has **warmed**]{.mark}
by [slightly]{.mark} more than one **degree** Celsius, [and]{.mark} the
[CO2 **concentration** has gone up]{.mark}, but the most dramatic,
**destructive**, and [deadly **extreme weather events** have not
changed]{.mark} significantly or have **declined**]{.underline}.33
[Further, 52 of 53 **studies** of disaster losses due to **extreme
weather** were unable to **attribute** the events [to human
causes]{.mark}, and the one **study**]{.underline} 34 [that did claim
**human attribution** was **flawed**]{.underline}.35

While there are [places]{.underline} in AR6 where they [claim the
frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased and]{.underline}
they try ([using models and weather pattern analysis) to
show]{.underline} these are [related to human **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as
emissions]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} do [acknowledge that there is
"low **confidence** in the human **influence** on the changes in **high
river flows** on the global scale ... \[and\] there is low
**confidence** in attributing **changes** in the probability or
**magnitude** of flood events to human **influence** ...]{.underline}"36

In the same section of AR6, they write: "... [it remains **uncertain**
whether past changes in Atlantic \[tropical cyclone\] **activity** are
outside the range of natural variability."37 A plot of US
**landfalling** major **hurricanes** is shown]{.underline} in Figure 3.

\[Figure omitted\]

As Figure 3 shows, the number of [major U.S. [**hurricanes** is
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}. The total number of hurricanes striking
the U.S. is also declining.38 In fact, [the global [weather
losses]{.mark}, due to all **extreme weather**, [are declining]{.mark}
as a **percentage** of global **GDP**]{.underline}.39

Bjorn Lomborg has shown that [[**climate** and **weather-related**
deaths have declined]{.mark} an astonishing 99% since
1920]{.underline}.40 This is very significant [since non-climate and
non-weather related deaths due to other natural disasters (earthquakes,
tsunamis, volcanos, etc.) have only seen a modest decline over the same
period]{.underline}.41 In other words, [even though the world
**population** has risen more than four times since 1920, there are many
fewer extreme weather deaths today than then]{.underline}. This suggests
(perhaps proves?) that [[humanity has]{.mark} **[adapted]{.mark}** well
to **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}s [since 1920.]{.underline}

Brun et al. (2022) found that a few tall, high-SLA plant species had
stronger effects on primary productivity than any measure of functional
diversity. [We add [data on species]{.mark} rarity to [show]{.mark} that
ongoing [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss is **unlikely** to **hamper**
ecosystem productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}, a core insight we feel the
authors missed.

Main text

Brun et al. (2022) present important new results regarding the
controversial relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Studying plant communities from the French and Swiss Alps, they assessed
if the presence or abundance of certain plant species were linked to
higher levels of pivotal ecosystem functions, here primary productivity.
They identified 'key' species, which have a decisive role in overall
productivity, and 'keystone' species, which have disproportionally large
productivity effects given their abundance, and which are a subset of
the key species. Out of 2918 plant species found, they identified 38 key
species, of which 11 qualified as keystone species. They found that the
five key species with largest effects on productivity jointly explained
more deviance in ecosystem productivity than any measure of functional
composition. The results provide evidence supporting the Trait Driver
Theory (Enquist et al. 2015), which is related to the 'mass-ratio
hypothesis' (Grime 1998; Garnier et al. 2004), and against the
'complementary resource use hypothesis' (Naeem et al. 1994). Key and
keystone species were found to be taller and have higher than average
specific leaf area.

Brun et al. (2022) state in their introduction that understanding the
relationships between species richness, functional traits and ecosystem
function "is pivotal for assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss".
Their study builds on solid empirical data, a strong analytical
framework and deals with real-world communities, shaped by abiotic
environmental filtering and non-artificial extinction processes,
something rarely undertaken (e.g. Vile et al. 2006; Mokanyet al. 2008).
Therefore, we miss an explicit evaluation of the assumptions underlying
the 'rivet-popper hypothesis' (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). In this powerful
narrative, the popping rivets leading to the crash of the plane are
juxtaposed to species going extinct, leading to ecosystem collapse. The
metaphor has inspired and gained some support from the so-called random
deletion experiments (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997; Hector et al. 1999), in
which all species are assumed to have equal extinction probability.

We plotted a rank-abundance diagram of the species in the data of Brun
et al. (2022) based on their regional occupancy (using mean local
abundance yielded qualitatively equal results, with a strong positive
correlation between regional occupancy and local abundance; Spearman rho
= 0.93, p \<\< 0.001). [We categorized species as either key, keystone,
redlisted or other and superimposed species]{.underline} category on the
diagram (Fig. 1). Redlist status was derived from the redlists for
vascular plants of Switzerland (Bornand et al. 2016) and the French
region Rhˆone-Alpes (Kristo et al. 2015). We found that key and keystone
species strongly tended to be regionally widespread and locally abundant
species, whereas species threatened with regional extinction were found
in the tail of the rank-abundance distribution. [A one-way anova of
difference in log-transformed frequencies revealed that key and keystone
species did not differ in abundance but were both significantly more
abundant than all other categories and that redlisted species were
significantly less abundant than all other categories]{.underline} (p
\<\< 0.001, TukeyHSD). [[It appears evident that]{.mark} the
[contribution of **rare species** to ecosystem **productivity** is a
weak argument]{.mark} for conservation actions in their
favour]{.underline}. In fact, Fig. 2a of the original paper shows that
many species leads to reduced ecosystem productivity when present.

A revised version of Ehrlich's aeroplane metaphor could sound: The wings
are effectively attached to the body of the plane by a small number of
large rivets of key importance, while numerous small rivets, most of
which tiny as needles, serve no other function than mere decoration
(Gould & Lewontin 1979). [[The biodiversity **crisis**]{.mark} and its
derived biotic homogenization **[implies]{.mark}** that already common
[**key species** increase in occupancy and **abundance**]{.mark},
[while]{.mark} initially [**un-common** species]{.mark} decrease or
[vanish]{.mark} **completely**]{.underline} (Finderup Nielsen et al.
2019; Kempel et al. 2020).

[[There is solid **evidence** for **loss** of]{.mark} endangered
[species]{.mark} **disproportionately** happening [in
**low-productive**]{.mark} **natural [ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Walker et al. 2004; Wassen et al. 2005), [[which]{.mark} [we
show]{.mark} have **[very low extinction risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Moreover, [t[he plant **species** critical to human sustenance are all
**superabundant crops**]{.mark}, such as wheat, corn and
rice]{.underline}. [We propose it is time the scientific **community
acknowledge** that arguments for [**biodiversity** conservation should
not be sought in **optimization** of **productivity**]{.mark},
decomposition rate or -- in general -- in efficiency of ecosystem
**processes**]{.underline}. [[We are]{.underline}]{.mark} not
misanthropic, but rather [[confident that **disciplines**]{.mark} such
as agronomy, forestry, technical sciences, geophysics and medicine [will
look after the well-being of our]{.mark} own

When the United Nations welcomed heads of state to the 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, a global consensus was reached to take vital steps to
save the planet. To that end, more than 170 nations gave their support
to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. But it was not the
only treaty at the summit. There was also a Convention on Biological
Diversity.

**[The climate change treaty is well understood internationally --- even
if the Trump administration and its congressional allies continue to
engage in dangerous denialism and obstruction.]{.underline}**

The biological diversity treaty is less well understood, especially in
the U.S., which has yet to join the more than 190 parties to the
agreement.

In 2020, Russ Feingold wants to change that.

Working as an ambassador for an ambitious international Campaign for
Nature, Feingold will in the new year be using his prominence --- as a
former three-term senator from Wisconsin who later served as the U.S.
Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region of Africa --- to get an urgent
conversation going in Africa (where he is highly regarded for his
long-term commitment to the continent) and in the U.S.

"The first thing is you have to get a baseline awareness of what the
problem is," said Feingold, who acknowledges that "there is a huge
learning curve."

Huge. But not insurmountable.

So let's start 2020 by putting things in perspective.

This is how Feingold explained things: "**[A major report from 150
leading scientists from around the world released on May 6, 2019, shows
that [the crisis facing wildlife]{.mark} and nature [is]{.mark} even
[worse than previously understood]{.mark}. Up to a million species are
threatened with extinction, many within decades. And the threats posed
to people from the destruction of nature are just as serious as those
posed by climate change]{.underline}**."

As a senator and a special envoy, Feingold was passionate about
addressing climate change, and he remains so now. But he wants people to
know that the climate crisis and the extinction threat pose distinct
challenges.

"If you say something to people about (the destruction of nature), they
look at you and they go, 'Oh. Climate change.' Yet, it's not the same!"
he explained.

Of course, the former senator said, **[climate and biodiversity concerns
are "crucially interrelated]{.underline}**." Of course, he added, "We
have to understand both of them and respond to both of them."

But Feingold wants people to recognize that when scientists describe
**[[the five]{.mark} key [causes of the loss of biodiversity]{.mark},
"[Climate]{.mark} change is third! It\'s enormously important. But first
is [land use]{.mark} --- agriculture, mining --- just impinging on
forests or natural areas. Second is what\'s called 'the exploitation of
organisms': [hunting, overfishing, cutting]{.mark} down [trees]{.mark}.
That\'s not climate. That\'s just harvesting stuff." (Fourth is
[pollution]{.mark}. Fifth is [invasive species]{.mark}.)]{.underline}**

So this is another urgent issue to concern ourselves with at a time when
there are already so many urgent issues. Feingold acknowledges that it
may be daunting to think about additional threats and additional
challenges. But, he explained, we are not starting from scratch.

Real work has been done to address the crisis. Countries have not just
signed on to the biological diversity treaty. Many have acted. As the
Campaign for Nature noted, "world leaders have committed to protecting
17 percent of land and 10 percent of the ocean by 2020 and governments
are on track to meet these global targets."

**[The [progress toward meeting these goals has been impressive.]{.mark}
Today, Feingold noted, roughly "15 percent of land and 7 percent of the
ocean are protected globally, but individual [countries]{.mark} have
helped [demonstrate]{.mark} that more [ambitious targets]{.mark} are
possible to meet. Ninety countries have protected more than 17 percent
of their land (the current global target), 27 have already protected
more than 30 percent, and a few --- including Namibia, Bhutan and
Venezuela --- are close to or even past protecting half of their
land."]{.underline}**

That's the good news.

**[Unfortunately, Feingold noted, "The scientists are now saying, 'Guess
what? We\'re not there, and [that\'s not even adequate]{.mark}.' They
are saying [we need 30-by-30 and 50-by-50]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[As in: [30 percent protected by 2030 and 50 percent protected by
2050]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[As the world warms, we will begin to approach **tipping points**,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming]{.underline} (Lenton et al. 2019). [Could tipping
points put us on an irreversible course towards existential
catastrophe]{.underline} by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, [[tipping
points need to be **contextualized** within]{.mark} our understanding of
[specific mechanisms]{.mark}, such as [**sea level rise**, **heat
stress**]{.mark} and **[crop failure]{.mark}**, by which climate change
could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen that [even the most
**outlandish warming scenarios do not pose a credible threat of
existential catastrophe** through any of these]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline}. So [[even]{.mark} if tipping points raise [the
probability of **extreme warming**]{.mark}, it is [not]{.mark} clear
that they [provide a]{.mark} **new and [credible pathway towards
existential catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that [[no]{.mark}ne of these
[tipping point]{.mark}s [presents a **credible threat**]{.mark} of human
extinction]{.underline}. I will review a few representative examples
below. (Interested readers are invited to consult Chapter 8 of the
Halstead report).

Begin with [[dieback of the Amazon **rainforest**]{.mark} in the tropics
[and **boreal forests** near the arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both
forests play an important role in trapping carbon, preventing it from
reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that [boreal forest dieback is likely to
be something of **[a wash]{.mark}**. As the world warms, the
southernmost reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support
existing forests. But at the same time, boreal forests will expand
northwards into land that was previously too cold to support them. For
this reason, boreal [forest dieback is **not expected to pose a
significant existential threat**]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most tropical
forests fluorished during the Eocene period, in which periods were more
than 10°C hotter than they are today. So there is no ready inference
from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the Amazon
rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon dieback is expected to
contribute about 0.3°C of additional warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But an
existential catastrophe? Certainly not.

[What about [arctic permafrost]{.mark}?]{.underline} A great deal of
carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and as the world
warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon into the
atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, the IPCC currently projects that
each 1°C of warming will lead to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released
from arctic permafrost. That is roughly two percent of the amount
projected to be released by 2100 on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP
4.5) by the IPCC. As before, [this [is a **regrettable catastrophe, but
hardly an existential threat**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### We're past tipping points.

Hazards at University College London, a co-director of the New Weather
Institute and was a contributor to the 2012 IPCC report on climate
change and extreme events. "Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant's Guide", Icon
Books, 07-28-2022

One thing that keeps climate researchers awake at night is the idea that
[[we]{.mark} have [passed]{.mark}]{.underline} one or more **[[points of
no return]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or 'tipping points' as they are known
in the trade. [Bringing temperatures down]{.underline} on an overheating
planet [is]{.underline} a bit **[[like]{.mark} [trying to turn the
Titanic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and there may well be situations where
-- **[[whatever we do]{.mark} in terms of slashing
emissions]{.underline}** -- [[we]{.mark} [can no longer avoid the
iceberg]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

A good, and especially apposite, example is [the Greenland Ice
Sheet]{.underline}, the wholesale [melting of which threatens a major
hike in global sea leve]{.underline}l. At **[more than a quarter of a
trillion tonnes a year]{.underline}**, [the current rate of ice loss is
already astonishing]{.underline}. But there could be worse news. Some
[researchers think]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} may already have
[passed]{.underline}, or be close to passing, **[[the ice
sheet's]{.mark} tipping point]{.underline}**. This would mean that,
[even if temperatures stopped rising today]{.underline}, **[[melting
would continue]{.mark} to accelerate]{.underline}** until Greenland was
ice-free [and [sea levels around 7 metres higher]{.mark} as a
result]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} would not necessarily happen
rapidly, but it **[[would be]{.mark} baked-in, and so ultimately
[inevitable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Then there are so-called positive feedbacks loops. These involve
responses to [rising temperatures]{.underline} that [act to heat up the
planet even more]{.underline}. For example, as temperatures have climbed
at high latitudes, so the [vast areas of permafrost]{.underline} in
Arctic Canada and Siberia have [started to thaw]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn **[[is releasing methane]{.mark}
trapped below]{.underline}**, [which acts]{.underline} -- in a
self-sustaining loop -- [to reinforce warmin]{.underline}g.

Another example is the progressive disappearance of Arctic sea ice. As
our planet continues to heat up, so [the area covered by sea ice reduces
and is replaced by open ocean]{.underline}. **[Because [dark water
absorbs]{.mark} more [heat]{.mark}]{.underline}** than white ice, [the
more ice is lost, the more temperatures at high latitudes
increase]{.underline}, **[[leading to]{.mark} even [more
melting]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

3\. Agriculture

Chapter 5 of Halstead's report looks at the effects of climate change on
agriculture. Climate change will directly threaten crops in many regions
through heat stress and drought risk. Climate change will also harm
agricultural workers by exposing them to heat stress and risks such as
flooding.

[There is no doubt that climate change will bring changes to
**agriculture**. These changes will be challenging, especially to the
economies and food supplies of many of the earth's poorest nations. But
for agricultural changes to amount to an **existential risk**, we would
have to be faced with threats such as **mass starvation** of a sizable
fraction of the human population.]{.underline}

[Even then, [it is **far from clear** that mass starvation would lead to
human **extinction**]{.mark} or to the permanent curtailment of our
potential for **future development**. [Humans have **already survived**
many large-scale famines]{.mark}, so unless climate change were to be
severe enough to make agriculture unsustainable in the **vast majority
of habitable regions**, the path from agricultural impacts to
existential risk is far from clear.]{.underline}

But let us just focus on the risk of starvation. How likely is it that
climate change will lead to extreme, worldwide famines by 2100? Here a
few points are relevant.

[First, almost all experts [expect global food production to **increase
steadily**]{.mark} over this century, [even under many of the most
**pessimistic climate scenarios**]{.mark}. That is because the [harms
from climate change will be offset by]{.mark} the spread of
**[yield-increasing tech]{.mark}**nologies such as improved farming
equipment, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, irrigation, and novel
crop varieties.]{.underline}

For example, a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations reviews changes in crop yields across a variety of
crop types, regions, and climate change scenarios. Here are the results
for non-irrigated systems:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

In this model, there may be a modest downward influence of climate
change on crop yields, although some regions are expected to benefit.
However, [technological change is [expected to **substantially outpace
climate change**]{.mark}, dragging up crop **yields** in even the worst
scenarios.]{.underline} None of this should be taken to deny that
agriculture is in for a rough ride, but it is hardly evidence that a
world-ending famine is on the horizon.

Second, [[impacts on ag]{.mark}riculture [can be partially
**mitigated**]{.mark}. We can **[irrigate]{.mark}** our [crops;
**migrate** crops]{.mark} to more temperate regions; or [improve **water
management**]{.mark} to deal with drought. We can also [develop **new
crop varieties**]{.mark} that are better-suited to a changing climate.
When these changes are built into agricultural models, the future looks
better still]{.underline}. For example, here is what the same report by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations projects for
crop yields in irrigated systems:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

On these projections, [the impact of climate change on yields for
irrigated crops may actually be **net positive**]{.underline}.

[Third, levels of [warming that would be **lethal** for
ag]{.mark}riculture [are well **out of reach** on even the most
pessimistic scenarios for warming]{.mark} by 2100.]{.underline} Here are
Halstead's estimates of the levels of warming needed to wipe out 8
months of the growing season in different localities:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

[Almost all of these lethal limits are out of reach on even the most
pessimistic warming trends.]{.underline} The latest IPCC report
forecasts warming across a range of scenarios:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

[In even the most pessimistic scenario, warming is projected to stay
**within five degrees**, and many scientists expect warming to be **far
lower** than this.]{.underline} (Halstead reviews the evidence and
suggests that the most likely scenarios lie on the yellow line).

[All of this is well below the levels needed to make agriculture
**impossible**]{.underline} (typically 10-30 degrees), and as we saw in
the Food and Agriculture Organization Report, some regions will actually
see yield benefits from climate change because they are currently too
cold to support agriculture during many months of the year.

Summing up, [[most of the world is **unlikely to starve** due to climate
change]{.mark} in this century. The poorest among us may well experience
increased food insecurity, especially if effective altruists continue to
divert resources from anti-poverty efforts towards existential risk
mitigation. Some workers will literally die in the fields from heat
stress. All of [this will be a great, and preventable
**catastrophe**]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} it will **[not]{.mark} be [an
existential catastrophe]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Warming\-\--AT: Heat Stress

#### [Heat]{.underline} [stress]{.underline} and induced [migration]{.underline} aren't [existential]{.underline}.

4\. Heat stress

As the world grows warmer, humans will be exposed to worrying amounts of
heat stress.

Here are the safe wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) limits on activities
by acclimatized people, as summarized by Halstead.

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

At present, WBGT around the globe is usually comfortably within these
limits, even during the hottest months of the year. Here is a map of
average WBGT from 1981-2010 during the hottest month in each local
climate (Kjellstrom et al. 2017).

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

[[On the most **realistic scenarios**]{.mark}, capped at 2-3 degrees of
warming by 2100, [heat stress will be]{.mark} bad but
**[manageable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Tens, but perhaps not hundreds of
millions will be exposed to temperatures making it impossible to work
outdoors, or even to survive without air conditioning during the hottest
months (Quiggin et al. 2021):

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

On less plausible, but more extreme scenarios, heat stress becomes
fairly dire. Here is a map of average WBGT on a range of extreme climate
scenarios (King et al. 2015):

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

How should we react to these scenarios? The first thing we should do is
cry. Should any of these scenarios come about, there will be sharp
increase in heat-related deaths, sustained outdoor labor will become
infeasible during the hottest months, crop yields will diminish, and
some populations may be forced to migrate to cooler areas.

However, [all of this [stops **well short** of an **existential**
catastrophe. Even in the most implausible scenarios, there are large
land masses that will remain **temperate**]{.mark}, even cool during the
hottest months of the year. Technologies such as air conditioning can,
and even today have begun to make warmer countries inhabitable during
hot summers. [Migration, while a great human tragedy, need **not lead to
extinction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [it is important to remember that the world currently
suffers from **greater** numbers of **cold-related deaths** than
heat-related deaths.]{.underline} Here, again, is Halstead:

For the Global Burden of Disease study, Zhao et al (2021) find that
[between 2000 and 2019, on average there were around 500,000
heat-related deaths and around **4.5 million** cold-related deaths each
year]{.underline}. The literature suggests that the benefits of climate
change in reducing cold-related deaths in temperate regions will be
outweighed by the increase in heat-related deaths in warmer regions.

On the most extreme (but unlikely) warming scenarios, that trend could
slightly reverse. [But just as an average of 4.5 million annual
cold-related deaths, while a great human tragedy, does not amount to an
existential catastrophe, so too most projections for future heat-related
deaths, while appalling, are better classified as catastrophic risks
than as **existential** risks.]{.underline}

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Warming\-\--AT: Hothouse Earth

#### Hothouse Earth scenario is bunk science with no ground. 

**Thorstad '23** \[David Thorstad, Asst. Professor of Philosophy at

<https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/>
// ***mosuQ***\]

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a [\`**[Hothouse Earth]{.mark}**']{.underline} phase, in which
even with little additional use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will
reach 6°C above preindustrial levels.

\[IMAGE REMOVED\]

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, [the first thing to say about
this scenario is that it still **[would not kill us]{.mark}**. We have
reviewed almost every plausible direct mechanism (heat stress, crop
failure, sea level rise, ...) by which warming could lead to existential
catastrophe. And we have seen that none of these mechanisms plausibly
threatens anything like existential catastrophe even under the extreme
assumption of 6°C warming]{.underline}.

More to the point, [\`Hothouse Earth' is rather **[speculative
science]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} media coverage has
**[stretched]{.mark}** its **[conclusions]{.mark}** far beyond those
initial speculations. [The **model** itself is **highly
uncertain**]{.mark} and presents options for avoiding
catastrophe]{.underline}. Here is Richard Bettes, Professor of Climate
Impacts at the University of Exeter:

With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay
presents the scenario as definite and imminent. [The impression is given
that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that the
"hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the **2°C threshold is extremely uncertain**, and [that
even if]{.mark} it were [correct, the extreme conditions would not occur
for **centuries or millennia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, [**[Steffen et
al.]{.mark}** (2018) [is]{.mark} an opinion piece, [not a **standalone
research paper**]{.mark}, and as such it really [doesn't do the kind of
modeling]{.mark} that would be [needed to advance it]{.mark}s thesis [to
the realm of **serious credibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other]{.underline} ... There is a great
deal of interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical
methods and calculations with large approximations. However, [we have
yet to see an **equivalent level of research** in the highly-complex
Earth System Models which generate the kind of detailed climate
projections used for addressing policy-relevant questions by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]{.underline}. Steffen
and colleagues have made a good start at addressing such questions,
going as far as they can on the basis of the existing literature, but
their essay should motivate new research to help narrow down the huge
uncertainties. This will help us see better whether "Hothouse Earth" is
our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
[[Steffen]{.mark} and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the
main conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate
six degrees of warming]{.underline}. Halstead collects together all of
the feedback effects mentioned by Steffen and colleagues in the main
text:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

The problem? [These [add up]{.mark} to [a mere **0.47°C of
warming**]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2100! If feedback effects are to take
us from 2°C of 6°C of warming, Steffen and colleagues need to find an
additional 3.53°C of warming after 2100 due to feedback effects.

[Steffen and colleagues certainly [claim that]{.mark} this [additional
warming will occur. But they are not]{.mark} terribly [**precise** about
the **details**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Halstead puts it: "they do not
explain what might cause the remaining 3.5°C of warming over millennia
implied by their Figure 1".

[This sort of speculative modeling can be a good impetus for future
work, but [it should not be taken as a **scientifically respectable**
ground for **alarmist predictions** of]{.mark} the likelihood of
[impending **existential catastrophe**]{.mark} due to climate change.
[There is simply **not enough evidence**]{.mark} to ground such
predictions]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Warming\-\--AT: Sea Level Rise

#### Sea level rise is [no]{.underline} [existential]{.underline} [threat]{.underline}.

2\. Rising sea levels

As the world warms, sea levels begin to rise. This, Halstead notes,
carries many threats to human civilization. Most obviously, coastal
areas can become permanently submerged underwater. Perhaps less
obviously, coastal areas will also see increased flooding, erosion,
ecosystem loss, salinization of water and soil, and impaired drainage of
coastal waterways.

Some cities have already experienced a preview of what is to come. In
fact, Halstead notes, many cities have seen rises as sharp as 2-4 meters
in average sea levels. For example, here are some of the figures that
Halstead cites:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

These changes have been difficult to cope with. Global warming may have
contributed to the catastrophic flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina, and Tokyo has taken costly action to adapt to rising sea
levels. But they have not killed, nor even displaced, the vast majority
of city residents in either city.

To put these numbers in perspective, here are the IPCC projections for
sea level rise, not just by 2100, but all the way out to 2300, across a
variety of warming scenarios:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

This is horrible. In particular, it illustrates a point nicely stressed
by Halstead: [we should not put so much focus on climate impacts
**before 2100**, because many impacts, such as [rising sea
levels]{.mark}, [will get significantly worse beyond 2300 even if we get
emissions under control]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[But it is also **survivable**]{.mark}. We saw that [many cities have
already coped with sea level rises comparable to the absolute
**worst-case** rise]{.mark} in global mean sea levels projected by the
IPCC, not just in 2100, but in 2300.]{.underline}

This is not to say that everyone will cope. In fact, many of the world's
poorest will be forced from their homes and cities. Here Halstead cites
Here Halstead cites projections by Lincke and Hinkel (2021) of migration
during the 21st century caused by sea level rise across best, worst and
median warming scenarios:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

This is a great human tragedy, concentrated largely in Asia and
disproportionately affecting the world's poorest nations. But [it is
**not an existential catastrophe**]{.underline}. Human civilization will
not end if millions, or tens of millions are forced to migrate.

It may seem that some experts expect rising sea levels to pose an
existential risk in this century. Lobbying by effective altruists has
spread the language of existential risk as far as the UN Secretary
General's Common Agenda. And it appears that even the IPCC has been
moved to use the term:

As the scale and pace of sea level rise accelerates beyond 2050,
long-term adjustments may in some locations be beyond the limits of
current adaptation options and for some species and some locations could
be an existential risk in the 21st century (medium confidence).

IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Technical Summary, p. 94

But the term has already been qualified (for some locations, and some
localities). In the rest of this passage, the IPCC clarifies exactly
what it means.

Nature-based interventions, for example wetlands and salt marshes, can
reduce impacts and costs while supporting biodiversity and livelihoods
but have limits under high warming levels and rapid sea level rise (high
confidence). Ecological limits and socioeconomic, financial and
governance barriers will be reached first and are determined by the type
of coastline and city or settlement (medium confidence). Accommodation
can reduce impacts on people and assets but can address only limited sea
level rise. Considering the long term now will help to avoid maladaptive
lock-in, to build capacity to act in a timely and pre-emptive manner and
to reduce risks to ecosystems and people.

IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Technical Summary, p. 94

That's quite a bit tamer than what effective altruists mean when they
speak of an existential risk.

There is every cause for concern about rising sea levels. That is
especially true for the inhabitants of coastal areas, some of whom may
be forced to abandon their settlements in this century. But [[nothing
approaching human **extinction** or]{.mark} the [permanent
**curtailment**]{.mark} of our potential for **future development** [has
even a **slight chance** of resulting from **rising sea levels**]{.mark}

2\. Moist and runaway greenhouse effects

As the world warms, evaporating water vapor will be entrapped within the
atmosphere, leading to additional warming. If the earth reaches high
temperatures (perhaps around 67°C) we will experience a moist greenhouse
effect in which, over millions of years, the oceans boil off into space.
If matters become very severe, we could experience a runaway greenhouse
effect in which the planet warms rapidly to over a thousand degrees
Celsius. This may well have happened on Venus.

These figures suggest the natural response to fears of moist and runaway
greenhouse effects: [it is [**highly implausible** that the
earth]{.mark} would soon [undergo the **over 50°C of warming** needed to
trigger a **moist greenhouse effect**]{.mark}, and if this were to
happen [we would be **long dead of other causes** before]{.mark} a moist
greenhouse were triggered]{.underline}. [Many of Halstead's responses
begin from the **implausibility** of a moist greenhouse effect being
triggered]{.underline}.

First, Halstead reviews the conditions across a variety of studies that
would be required for a moist greenhouse effect to be triggered. Here
are, for brevity, the first five:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

However, Halstead argues, depending on how we measure the amount of
accessible fossil fuels in the world, burning literally all of the
world's accessible fuels and doing nothing to mitigate our folly would
bring atmospheric CO2 concentration to somewhere between 1,600ppm and a
bit over 5,000ppm. This means that [[even in the]{.mark} **very
[unlikely scenario]{.mark}** [that humans **exhaust**]{.mark} our entire
stock of [fossil fuels and **do nothing to offset**]{.mark} these
emissions, [a moist greenhouse effect remains **highly
improbable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Halstead also reminds us (as we saw in Part 4) that [[the earth has
**already** been at least **17°C hotter than preindustrial
levels**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This means that [if we think **lower
levels** of warming could risk triggering a moist or runaway greenhouse
effect, we will have a [difficult time explaining how these
effects]{.mark} are meant to [come about now when they **were not
triggered in**]{.mark} **previous, [warmer
climates]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Finally, Halstead reminds us, [even if we did transition into [a moist
greenhouse effect]{.mark} it [would take **millions of years**]{.mark}
for the oceans to boil off]{.underline}. This means that [humans would
have [**ample time to reverse** the effects]{.mark}]{.underline} of
warming unless we entered a runaway greenhouse regime. We could reverse
warming using complicated methods, such as decarbonization. But on this
timescale, we could also reverse warming through simpler methods, in
large part by simply reducing our emissions and waiting for previously
emitted CO2 to dissipate.

Summing up, [there is very little reason to believe that the earth is
likely to experience a moist or runaway greenhouse effect any time soon.
If this did happen, we would probably be dead long before it begun,
rendering the appeal to moist greenhouse effects a moot
point]{.underline}. And [if we]{.underline} somehow [managed to survive
until the beginning of a moist greenhouse effect, we might well be able
to reverse it]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1AR\-\--!/D\-\--Warming\-\--AT: Conflict Magnifier

#### Warming won't cause global conflict

**Cook 20** -- Dr. Ian, Senior Lecturer in Global Politics and Policy at
Murdoch University, PhD in Political Theory from the University of
Queensland. "The Politics of the Final Hundred Years of Humanity
(2030-2130)", Springer Singapore, xx-xx-2020

Yet **[a]{.underline}**nother [problem with the assumption that
catastrophic human-caused environment change simply causes civil
war]{.underline}, as Salehyan and Hendrix noted, [is that violence at
the scale of a civil war requires significant resources. In their view,
civil wars are more likely to occur in times of **relative abundance**.
[While "**riots**]{.mark} and **protests**, [may
emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} from conditions of scarcity," they argue,
"[**[sustaining]{.mark}** a militant organization [requires]{.mark}
considerable planning and [resources]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Salehyan and
Hendrix 2014, p. 240). [Reasons to fight might exist. For this [to turn
into]{.mark} civil [war]{.mark}, however, [people]{.mark} "also
[need]{.mark} the **[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to do so,
[[and]{.mark} environmental [scarcity]{.mark} may **limit such
capability**, thus **[undermin]{.mark}ing [the resource base
necessary]{.mark}** for mobilizing armed violence"]{.underline}
(Salehyan and Hendrix 2014, p. 240).

A related debate concerns what Adams and colleagues have claimed to be
[a **sampling bias** in studies of the connection between environment
change and armed conflict]{.underline} (Adams et al. 2018). Levy accepts
the existence of some sampling bias but rejects the view that this bias
results in an overstatement of the connection between environment change
and conflict. "Knowing that case selection is biased is useful, but not
a reason to lower our estimate of the climate's impact on conflict"
(Levy 2018, p. 441).

In responding to Levy's criticism, authors claiming bias wrote that they
did not "deny a link between climate change and conflict in principal.
Indeed, some of our own recent work indicates that such [a [link]{.mark}
exists, but it [is **highly conditional**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Their
problem with the research being done in this field was that "[[sampling
biases]{.mark}... increase the risk that such links are
**[overstate]{.mark}**d]{.underline}, that [crucial world regions do not
receive sufficient attention]{.underline} and that little knowledge is
produced on peaceful adaptation" (Ide et al. 2018, p. 442-- 3).

After reviewing the literature on the relationship between climate
change and violent conflict, Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld concluded
that the "[current **[lit]{.mark}**erature [offers **mixed
ev**]{.mark}idence]{.underline}. This makes it difficult to render a
definitive statement about the climate-conflict relationship" (2017, p.
640). While they pointed out that just over 60% of the studies they
reviewed found "that climate change variables are positively correlated
with higher levels of violent conflict," Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld
also argued that "[many **subtleties** and [**countertrends**
underlie]{.mark} this overall pattern]{.underline}" (2017, p. 640).
Thus, even though "a majority of reviewed studies envision climate
variables influencing conflict through a causal pathway, ... these
[[pathways]{.mark} are]{.underline} often [**theoretically
underspecified** and [have **only weak**]{.mark} **empirical
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Sakaguchi et al. 2017, p. 641).

As Koubi put it, the research that has been done on this question
"provides some evidence that climatic changes could act as a 'threat
multiplier' in several of the world's regions. In particular, the extant
literature shows that climatic conditions can lead to conflict in
agricultural-dependent regions and in combination and interaction with
other socioeconomic and political factors" (Koubi 2018, p. 200). After
having claimed that, to their knowledge, "[**[no one]{.mark}** in the
field of climate research has [suggested]{.mark} that [climate]{.mark}
change [could be the **'sole cause' of war**]{.mark}, violence, unrest
or migration]{.underline}", Butler and Kefford recommended "viewing
climate change instead as a risk multiplier, influencer or co-factor ...
In this way of thinking, environmental and ecological factors interact
with social determinants, including those that are economic, demographic
and political, to produce phenomena such as migration, conflict and
famine" (2018, p. 587).

There can be no doubt that conflict will increase during the final
hundred years of humanity. But it will result from a complex interaction
of socio-political factors and a catastrophically changed environment.
It may not go beyond conflict between different groups or between the
government and opposition groups and become civil war. This depends on
the capacity of those opposition groups. In many cases, they will lack
the resources to conduct a civil war. The Syrian war is itself a good
illustration of the problem, as the groups opposed to the Syrian
government have only been able to conduct the extended civil war in
which they have been engaged with the support of outside groups.
(Mazzetti and Apuzzo 2016).

The question of whether civil war will break out is something that can
only be answered "region by region" and the answer must be based on
"knowledge of pre-conflict geographies, such as drivers of resilience
and vulnerability" (Farbotko 2018). Sometimes governments may abandon
territory and opposition groups can seize control of that land. But it
is likely to be land that is suffering worst from the effects of
catastrophic human-caused environment change and will not be habitable.
To replace an existing government or take control of a region within a
country through [civil [war]{.mark}]{.underline} is no simple thing. It
may happen. But it will not happen on the scale that some people have
predicted. And it [[will **not happen**]{.mark} just [because of]{.mark}
the [weather]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No climate wars OR extinction

**Shellenberger 20** -- Michael, Founder and President of Environmental
Progress and Co-Founder of the Breakthrough Institute. "Why I Believe
Climate Change Is Not the End of the World", Quillette,
<https://quillette.com/2020/07/08/why-i-believe-climate-change-is-not-the-end-of-the-world>,

What the IPCC had actually written in its 2018 report and press release
was that in order to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5
degrees Celsius from preindustrial times, carbon emissions needed to
decline 45 percent by 2030. [The [IPCC did **not** say]{.mark} the
**world would end**, nor that **[civilization would collapse]{.mark}**,
if temperatures rose above 1.5 degrees Celsius]{.underline}.

Scientists had a similarly negative reaction to the extreme claims made
by Extinction Rebellion. Stanford University atmospheric scientist Ken
Caldeira, one of the first scientists to raise the alarm about ocean
acidification, stressed that "[while many species are threatened with
extinction, **[climate]{.mark} change [does not threaten]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}." MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel
told me, "I don't have much patience for the apocalypse criers. I don't
think it's helpful to describe it as an apocalypse."

An AOC spokesperson told Axios, "We can quibble about the phraseology,
whether it's existential or cataclysmic." But, he added, "We're seeing
lots of \[climate change--related\] problems that are already impacting
lives."

But if that's the case, [the impact is **dwarfed** by the **92 percent
decline** in the decadal death toll from natural disasters since its
peak in the 1920s]{.underline}. In that decade, 5.4 million people died
from natural disasters. In the 2010s, just 0.4 million did. Moreover,
that decline occurred during a period when the global population nearly
quadrupled.

In fact, both rich and poor societies have become far less vulnerable to
extreme weather events in recent decades. In 2019, the journal Global
En­vironmental Change published a major study that found death rates and
economic damage dropped by 80 to 90 percent during the last four
decades, from the 1980s to the present.

While global sea levels rose 7.5 inches (0.19 meters) between 1901 and
2010, the IPCC estimates sea levels will rise as much as 2.2 feet (0.66
meters) by 2100 in its medium scenario, and by 2.7 feet (0.83 meters) in
its high-end scenario. [**[Even if]{.mark}** these predictions prove to
be **[significant underestimates]{.mark}**, the [**slow pace** of
sea]{.mark} level [rise]{.mark} will likely [allow]{.mark} societies
[**ample time** for **adaptation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[We have **good examples** of **successful adaptation** to sea level
rise. The **Netherlands**]{.underline}, for instance,
[became]{.underline} a [wealthy]{.underline} nation [despite having
one-third of its landmass below sea level]{.underline}, including areas
a full seven meters below sea level, as a result of the gradual sinking
of its landscapes.

And [today, our [capability for **modifying environments** is]{.mark}
**far [great]{.mark}er than** ever before]{.underline}. Dutch experts
today are already working with the government of Bangladesh to prepare
for rising sea levels.

What about fires? Dr. Jon Keeley, a US Geological Survey scientist in
California who has researched the topic for 40 years, told me, "We've
looked at the history of climate and fire throughout the whole state,
and through much of the state, particularly the western half of the
state, we don't see any relationship between past climates and the
amount of area burned in any given year."

In 2017, Keeley and a team of scientists modeled 37 different regions
across the United States and found that "humans may not only influence
fire regimes but their presence can actually override, or swamp out, the
effects of climate." Keeley's team found that the only statistically
significant factors for the frequency and severity of fires on an annual
basis were population and proximity to development.

As for the Amazon, the New York Times reported, correctly, that "\[the
2019\] fires were not caused by climate change."

[In]{.underline} early [2020, [scientists challenged the notion]{.mark}
that [rising carbon]{.mark} dioxide levels in the ocean [were
making]{.mark} coral reef [fish]{.mark} species [oblivious]{.mark} to
predators]{.underline}. The seven scientists who published their study
in the journal Nature had, three years earlier, raised questions about
the marine biologist who had made such claims in the journal Science in
2016. After an investigation, James Cook University in Australia
concluded that [the biologist had **fabricated her data**]{.underline}.

[When it comes to food production]{.underline}, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations [(FAO) concludes]{.underline} that
crop [[**yields** will **increase**]{.mark}
**significantly**]{.underline}, under a wide range of climate change
scenarios. Humans today produce enough food for ten billion people, a 25
percent surplus, and experts believe we will produce even more despite
climate change.

Food production, the FAO finds, will depend more on access to tractors,
irrigation, and fertilizer than on climate change, just as it did in the
last century. The FAO projects that even farmers in the poorest regions
today, like sub-Saharan Africa, may see 40 percent crop yield increases
from technological improvements alone.

In its fourth assessment report, the IPCC projected that by 2100, the
global economy would be three to six times larger than it is today, and
that the costs of adapting to a high (4 degrees Celsius) temperature
rise would reduce gross domestic product (GDP) just 4.5 percent.

[Does any of that really sound like the end of the world?]{.underline}

The apocalypse now

Anyone interested in seeing the end of the world up close and in person
could do little worse than to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in central Africa. The Congo has a way of putting first-world prophecies
of climate apocalypse into perspective. I traveled there in December
2014 to study the impact of widespread wood fuel use on people and
wildlife, particularly on the fabled mountain gorillas.

Within minutes of crossing from the neighboring country of Rwanda into
the Congolese city of Goma, I was taken aback by the extreme poverty and
chaos: children as young as two years old perched on the handlebars of
motorcycles flying past us on roads pockmarked with giant potholes;
tin-roofed shanties as homes; people crammed like prisoners into tiny
buses with bars over the windows; trash everywhere; giant mounds of
cooled lava on the sides of the road, reminders of the volcanic anger
just beneath the Earth's surface.

In the 1990s and again in the early 2000s, Congo was the epicenter of
the Great African War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, which
involved nine African countries and resulted in the deaths of three to
five million people, mostly because of disease and starvation. Another
two million people were displaced from their homes or sought asylum in
neighboring countries. Hundreds of thousands of people, women, and men,
adults, and children, were raped, sometimes more than once, by different
armed groups.

During our time in the Congo, armed militias roaming the countryside had
been killing villagers, including children, with machetes. Some blamed
Al-Shabaab terrorists coming in from Uganda, but nobody took credit for
the attacks. The violence appeared unconnected to any military or
strategic objective. The national military, police, and United Nations
Peacekeeping Forces, about 6,000 soldiers, were either unable or
unwilling to do anything about the terrorist attacks.

"Do not travel," the United States Department of State said, bluntly, of
the Congo on its website. "Violent crime, such as armed robbery, armed
home invasion, and assault, while rare compared to petty crime, is not
uncommon, and local police lack the resources to respond effectively to
serious crime. Assailants may pose as police or security agents."

One reason I felt safe traveling to the eastern Congo and bringing my
wife, Helen, was that the actor Ben Affleck had visited several times
and even started a charity there to support economic development. If the
eastern Congo was safe enough for a Hollywood celebrity, I reasoned, it
would be safe enough for Helen and me.

To make sure, I hired Affleck's guide, translator, and "fixer," Caleb
Kabanda, a Congolese man with a reputation for keeping his clients safe.
We spoke on the telephone before I arrived. I told Caleb I wanted to
study the relationship between energy scarcity and conservation.
Referring to the North Kivu province capital of Goma, the sixth most
populated city in the Congo, Caleb asked, "Can you imagine a city of
nearly two million people relying on wood for energy? It's crazy!"

Ninety-eight percent of people in eastern Congo rely on wood and
charcoal as their primary energy for cooking. In the Congo as a whole,
nine out of 10 of its nearly 92 million people do, while just one out of
five has any access to electricity. The entire country relies on just
1,500 megawatts of electricity, which is about as much as a city of one
million requires in developed nations.

The main road Caleb and I used to travel from Goma to the communities
around Virunga Park had recently been paved, but there was little else
in the way of infrastructure. Most roads were dirt roads. When it
rained, both the paved and unpaved roads and the surrounding homes were
flooded because there was no flood control system. I was reminded of how
much we take for granted in developed nations. We practically forget
that the gutters, canals, and culverts, which capture and divert water
away from our homes, even exist.

Is climate change playing a role in Congo's ongoing instability? If it
is, it's outweighed by other factors. Climate change, noted a large team
of researchers in 2019, "has affected organized armed conflict within
countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development
and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more
influential."

There is only a barely functioning government in the Congo. When it
comes to security and development, people are mostly on their own.
Depending on the season, farmers suffer too much rain or not enough.
Recently, there has been flooding once every two or three years. Floods
regularly destroy homes and farms.

Researchers with the Peace Research Institute Oslo note, "Demographic
and environmental variables have a very moderate effect on the risk of
civil conflict." The IPCC agrees. "[[There is]{.mark} robust evidence of
[disasters]{.mark} displacing people worldwide, [but limited
**ev**]{.mark}idence that [climate]{.mark} change or sea-level rise [is
the]{.mark} direct [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Lack of infrastructure plus scarcity of clean water brings disease. As a
result, Congo suffers some of the highest rates of cholera, malaria,
yellow fever, and other preventable diseases in the world.

"[Lower levels of GDP are the **most important predictor** of armed
conflict]{.underline}," write the Oslo researchers, who add, "[Our
results show that resource scarcity affects the risk of conflict less in
low-income states than in wealthier states]{.underline}."

[If resources determined a nation's fate, then resource-scarce Japan
would be poor and at war while the Congo would be rich and at
peace]{.underline}. Congo is astonishingly rich when it comes to its
lands, minerals, forests, oil, and gas.

There are many reasons why the Congo is so dysfunctional. It is
massive---it is the second largest African nation in area, behind only
Algeria---and difficult to govern as a single country. It was colonized
by the Belgians, who fled the country in the early 1960s without
establishing strong government institutions, like an independent
judiciary and a military.

Is it overpopulated? The population of Eastern Congo has doubled since
the 1950s and 1960s. But the main factor is technological: the same area
could produce much more food and support many more people if there were
roads, fertilizers, and tractors.

The Congo is a victim of geography, colonialism, and terrible
post-colonial governments. Its economy grew from \$7.4 billion in 2001
to \$38 billion in 2017, but the annual per capita income of \$561 is
one of the lowest in the world, leading many to conclude that much of
the money that should flow to the people is being stolen.

For the last 20 years, the Rwandan government has been taking minerals
from its neighbor and exporting them as its own. To protect and obscure
its activities, Rwanda has financed and overseen the low-intensity
conflict in Eastern Congo, according to experts.

There were free elections in 2006 and optimism around the new president,
Joseph Kabila, but he proved as corrupt as past leaders. After being
re-elected in 2011, he stayed in power until 2018, when he installed a
candidate who won just 19 percent of the vote as compared to the
opposition candidate, who won 59 percent. As such, Kabila and his allies
in the legislature appear to be governing behind the scenes.

**[Catastrophic consequences for civilization]{.underline}**. The
[consequences of this rapid pruning]{.underline} [of the evolutionary
tree of life extend beyond the obvious]{.underline}. [There could be
**surprising effects**]{.underline} [of biodiversity loss]{.underline}
[that scientists are **unable to**]{.underline} fully [**anticipate** in
advance]{.underline}. For example, prior research has shown that
[**[localized]{.mark}** [ecosystems]{.mark} [can undergo **abrupt and
irreversible shifts**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[when they reach a tipping
point]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a 2012 paper published in
Nature, there are reasons for thinking that **[we may be approaching a
tipping point]{.underline}** of this sort **[[in the global
ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [beyond which the [consequences could
be **catastrophic**]{.mark} for civilization]{.underline}. As the
authors write, **[[a]{.mark} planetary-scale [transition could
precipitate]{.mark}]{.underline}** "[[substantial losses of **ecosystem
services** **required**]{.mark} [to **sustain**]{.mark} [the human
population]{.mark}]{.underline}." An ecosystem service is any ecological
process that benefits humanity, such as food production and crop
pollination. [If the global ecosystem were to cross a **tipping
point**]{.underline} [and substantial **ecosystem services were
lost**]{.underline}, [[the results could be]{.mark}
"**[widespread]{.mark} [social unrest, economic instability, and loss of
human life]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}" According to Missouri
Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors,
[[this could occur]{.mark} in]{.underline} a matter of
**[decades]{.underline}**---**[far more [quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[**than** most of the expected consequences of **climate
change**]{.underline}, **[yet equally destructive]{.underline}**.
[[Biodiversity loss is a "**threat multiplier**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
that, [by [pushing societies to]{.mark} the brink of
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[will exacerbate]{.mark} existing
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and introduce]{.mark} entirely
**[new struggles]{.mark}** between state and non-state
actors]{.underline}. Indeed, **[[it]{.mark} [could]{.mark} even [fuel
the rise of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (After all, climate change
has been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple
high-ranking US officials, such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel and CIA director John Brennan, have affirmed that climate change
and terrorism are connected.) The reality is that **[we are entering the
sixth mass extinction]{.underline}** in the 3.8-billion-year history of
life on Earth, and **[the impact of this event could be felt by
civilization]{.underline}** "in as little as three human lifetimes," as
the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the [widespread
[decline of biological populations]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} plausibly **[[initiate]{.mark} a [dramatic
transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[of the global
ecosystem]{.underline}** [on an even faster]{.underline}
[timescale]{.underline}: perhaps **[a single human
lifetime.]{.underline}** The **[unavoidable conclusion]{.underline}**
[is that [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss]{.mark}]{.underline} [[constitutes
an **existential threat**]{.mark} in its own right]{.underline}. As
such, [[it ought to be considered]{.mark} [alongside]{.mark} **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **nuclear

#### Now is key: the next 5 years will be crucial

-- DOA: 6/4/2025, MoState JG

From 21 October to 1 November, leaders from across the globe are
gathering in Cali, Colombia for COP16---the 16th Conference of the
Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. This isn't just
another meeting. [[It's a critical moment]{.underline}]{.mark} to assess
how far countries have come in implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework (GBF), a pivotal plan [[to halt and reverse
biodiversity loss]{.mark} by 2030.]{.underline}

With 27 October designated as Ocean Day at COP16, the [spotlight is on
marine biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard our
oceans]{.underline}. The WWF Global Arctic Programme is bringing
attention to **[[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[a region [at the
frontlines of climate change and biodiversity
collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Arctic Ocean ecosystems are]{.mark}
not only vital for the animals and people living there, they also play a
[critical]{.mark} role [in regulating]{.mark} our [global
climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, [[they face unprecedented threats,
with the Arctic warming four times faster than the rest of the
planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Arctic marine biodiversity at a tipping point]{.underline}**

[**[The Arctic Ocean]{.mark}** is home to iconic wildlife, such as polar
bears and seals, but it also **[supports]{.mark} the [plankton and fish
that sustain entire food chains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
[[this]{.underline} **[biodiversity is under severe
threat]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[[Climate change, coupled with human
activities like shipping and oil and gas exploration]{.mark}, [is
driving]{.mark} the [rapid melting of sea ice and destroying critical
habitats]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [We are fast [approaching a tipping
point]{.mark}---one [where]{.mark} these **[losses will be
irreversible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [consequences of inaction are catastrophic]{.underline}. The
[**[melting of]{.mark} the Greenland [ice]{.mark} sheet [and thawing
permafrost]{.mark}** not only spell disaster for Arctic species but
could also [trigger rising sea levels and release]{.mark} even
[more]{.mark} [greenhouse gases, **accelerating global climate
impacts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For Arctic marine species, these
changes mean habitat loss, crumbling food chains, and a drastically
altered environment that threatens their survival.]{.underline}

Governments must act now

[Given]{.underline} the [magnitude of]{.underline} these
[challenges]{.underline}, the [[urgency]{.underline}]{.mark} for bold
action at COP16 [[cannot be overstated]{.underline}. **[The next five
years will be crucial]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[in preventing
irreversible damage to Arctic ecosystems]{.underline}.]{.mark} To
protect biodiversity and meet the GBF's targets, countries must not only
strengthen their commitments but also focus on implementing effective,
science-based solutions.

// ***mosuQ***\]

In 2024, the world witnessed an unprecedented rise in sea levels,
coinciding with what has been recorded as Earth's hottest year. This
alarming trend was highlighted by [[NASA's]{.mark} detailed
[analysis]{.mark}, revealing the unexpected extent of **oceanic
changes**. The report [underscores the urgent reality of]{.mark} climate
change and its tangible effects on our planet's oceans]{.underline}. As
the globe continues to grapple with increasing temperatures,
[understanding the dynamics of **[sea level rise]{.mark}** becomes
crucial]{.underline}. This article delves into the significant findings
of NASA's study, exploring the mechanisms behind these changes and their
potential implications for future generations.

NASA's Groundbreaking Findings on Sea Level Rise

According to the latest analysis released by NASA, [global sea
levels]{.underline} rose by a staggering 0.23 inches (0.59 centimeters)
in 2024. This is notably higher than the previously predicted 0.17
inches (0.43 cm). Such a [rise has been [attributed to]{.mark} an
unusual amount of ocean warming and [the **influx of meltwater from
glaciers** and other **land-based ice**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The study,
led by NASA's expert team using sophisticated satellite imagery,
highlights the accelerated pace at which our oceans are swelling. Josh
Willis from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory emphasized the increasing
[rate of sea level rise, noting that each year presents new **challenges
and surprises**]{.underline}.

This unexpected rise serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of
human-induced climate change. [As greenhouse gas emissions continue to
heat our planet, the resulting thermal expansion of seawater and the
melting of polar ice caps contribute significantly to **rising sea
levels**]{.underline}. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite,
launched in 2020, plays a pivotal role in monitoring these changes,
providing critical data to inform global responses to this growing
threat.

The Role of Thermal Expansion and Ice Melt

[Sea level rise is **primarily driven** by two key processes: the
**melting of glaciers and ice caps**, and the thermal expansion of
seawater as it warms]{.underline}. Traditionally, the melting of
land-based ice has been the dominant factor; however, NASA's 2024
findings reveal a shift. In that year, thermal expansion accounted for
two-thirds of the observed sea level rise, marking a significant change
in the underlying dynamics.

This shift underscores the complex interplay between various climate
factors. As Earth's temperatures reach unprecedented highs, thermal
expansion's role becomes increasingly prominent. This process, where
water expands as it heats up, is a direct consequence of rising global
temperatures. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting
future trends and implementing effective mitigation strategies. As these
changes accelerate, the need for comprehensive climate policies becomes
ever more pressing.

Historical Context and Future Projections

To grasp the full impact of recent sea level changes, it's essential to
consider the historical context. Over a three-decade period from 1993 to
2023, global sea levels rose by approximately four inches (10 cm) in
total. This steady increase is visually represented in a graph provided
by NASA, showing a solid red line that indicates the trajectory of this
rise. The dotted red line projects future increases, highlighting the
ongoing challenges posed by climate change.

The year 2024 stands out not only for its record-breaking temperatures
but also for the accelerated pace of sea level rise. As the planet
continues to warm, projections suggest further [[increases in sea
levels]{.mark}, [threaten]{.mark}ing coastal communities and
**[ecosystems worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This growing threat
necessitates urgent action to address the root causes of climate change
and mitigate its impacts on vulnerable populations.

Implications for Coastal Communities and Global Populations

[The implications of rising sea levels are profound]{.underline},
particularly for communities living on islands or along coastlines. [As
oceans encroach upon inhabited areas, the risks of [**flooding, erosion,
and habitat loss** intensify]{.mark}. This [poses]{.mark} significant
[challenges for **infrastructure, food security**, and]{.mark} the
**livelihoods** of millions of people worldwide]{.underline}. Humanity's
continued emission of greenhouse gases exacerbates these risks,
underscoring the need for immediate and sustained action.

Efforts to combat climate change must prioritize adaptive strategies to
protect vulnerable populations. This includes investing in resilient
infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, and promoting
sustainable land-use practices. [As we confront the realities of a
changing climate, international cooperation and innovative solutions
become crucial in **safeguarding [the future of our
planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[**Climate change** is an **existential threat** to humans]{.mark} and
global biodiversity]{.underline}, as was [[reinforced in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} sixth assessment report (1) of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark}**), as well as Conferences of the Parties
of the IPCC (Glasgow, UK; November 2021) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[UN C]{.mark}onvention on [B]{.mark}iological
[D]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}** (Montreal, Canada; December 2022).
[But these gatherings also implicitly highlight severe shortcomings in
how conservation scientists and policymakers are addressing the climate
change threat]{.underline}. Research in climate change ecology and
conservation is still dominated by attempts to understand how
[species]{.underline} are vulnerable to the altered abiotic conditions
driven by climate change alone (e.g., rising temperature) (2). This
[threat is **undoubtedly important**]{.underline}. But we argue that
[other facets of [climate disruption could have]{.mark} vastly greater
[impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}---in particular, the ways
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} which climate-altered **[[human
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, demographics, [**[and
economies]{.underline}**]{.mark} interact with natural ecosystems and
species. Unfortunately, these [human dimensions of climate change
ecology have received scant attention. Broad-scale [assessment]{.mark}
of the scale of biodiversity responses to climate change]{.underline}
(3) [[are]{.mark} therefore **[underestimating the
problem]{.mark}**]{.underline}---potentially on a massive scale---when
only incorporating direct, abiotic impacts. Climate change is often
considered to be one of the threats facing biodiversity, distinct from
other threats and not considered---at least currently---to have as
strong an impact as habitat loss and overexploitation (4, 5). But rather
than being a separate factor, **[[climate change
magnifies]{.underline}]{.mark}** these other [[**threats** and
is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [**[exacerbating]{.mark}** all]{.underline}
of the [pathways by which humans directly cause [species
endangerment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 1). Policymakers and planners
still do not recognize this combined impact when considering how to
abate climate disruption and biodiversity loss. Indeed, [it is these
synergies, along with [the pace of change]{.mark}, that [make]{.mark}
the current [**extinction crisis**]{.mark} unique in Earth's
history]{.underline}. Although global climate change of about 6 °C
caused Earth\'s biggest mass extinction event to date (at the end of the
Permian), this phenomenon likely occurred an order of magnitude more
slowly than what we are inducing today---and in a world without
significant habitat loss, degradation, and other biodiversity threats
from the actions of a single species. Appreciating the Complexity
Although conservation efforts have been key to slowing recent losses of
biodiversity, scientists and [decision makers need to stop viewing
climate change as just another separate threat]{.underline} to Earth's
biosphere. [[Climate change magnifies]{.underline}]{.mark} the intensity
of the other drivers of **[[biodiversity decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
such as habitat loss, overexploitation, and invasive species. Regional
drying is making formerly remote areas of tropical rainforests
accessible, thereby increasing hunting, fishing, and logging pressure
(6). [Warming can]{.underline} expand the cultivation zone of
cold-intolerant crops upwards in elevation, [threaten]{.underline}ing
montane areas with [**deforestation** and land conversion]{.underline}
(7). Climate-facilitated expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis)
cultivation in Southeast Asia, for example, would threaten native
species in these hyperdiverse systems much more than either habitat loss
or climate change alone (7). [[Rising **ocean
temperatures**]{.underline}]{.mark} can increase the
[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark} of [**[invasive
species]{.underline}**]{.mark} (8) [[and]{.mark} make environmental
pollutants more [toxic]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(9) (Fig. 1).
Evidence increasingly shows that the destruction of coral reefs is
particularly acute when warming waters act in combination with other
stressors; plastic pollution, overfishing, and crown-of-thorns starfish
(Acanthaster planci) outbreaks all interact synergistically with rising
ocean temperatures to inhibit coral fertilization and larval recruitment
(10). [Loss of coral reefs]{.underline} can then [**cascade**
to]{.underline} harm at least two of the other highly diverse (and
economically important) [marine ecosystems]{.underline}, mangroves and
seagrasses, through altered pH buffering, sediment capture, and
abundance of shared animal species (11). In turn, non-climatic
biodiversity threats can intensify climate change impacts. Nutrient
loading and turbidity from agricultural runoff and logging-induced
erosion render corals more susceptible to mortality in the face of
warmer temperatures and more-frequent storms (10). Fear of introducing
potentially invasive species is slowing or preventing the widespread
adoption of assisted colonization as a strategy to ameliorate climate
change impacts (12); the bramble cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) is among
the first documented extinctions from contemporary climate change---a
loss that was preventable. Although ecologists have done a thorough job
of addressing the direct impacts of changing abiotic conditions on
organisms (e.g., 3), synergies between climate and other anthropogenic
impacts have received much less attention. [Millions of people
are]{.underline} already being [**displaced** because of climate
change]{.underline}, movements that will likely become the largest human
migrations in history (13). How nations deal with the influx and outflow
of [climate refugees]{.underline} will [affect every aspect of society,
including biodiversity conservation]{.underline}. Forests and wildlife
in the global biodiversity hotspot of South Asia, for example, are
undoubtedly affected by rising temperatures and altered precipitation.
And yet, over the next 30 years, they may be much more strongly affected
by tens of millions of people dispersing throughout the region after
rising seas inundate much of Bangladesh. The recent floods in Pakistan
further showcase the devastation of climate change-induced extreme
weather events, with crops, villages, and even cities almost entirely
destroyed, leaving hundreds of thousands of people destitute. How the
country rebuilds its agriculture and population centers will have a
massive impact on its biodiversity. The ongoing situation in the
Kutupalong and Nayapara Refugee Camps is an early warning of how such
processes could play out over much of the world. The camps support
nearly a million Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in neighboring
Myanmar. In densely populated Bangladesh, rather than trying to house
the people in already-developed areas such as cities or crop lands, the
government has donated forested area to the refugee camps, including
degazetting 2,500 ha of the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (14). The urgent
need for living space, building materials, and firewood has,
unsurprisingly, led to rapid deforestation, with the surrounding forest
cover halved over just two years (14). This habitat destruction and
disturbance have greatly increased human--elephant (Elephas maximus)
conflicts (15). Overhunting in the remaining forests has caused the
local extirpation of wild pigs (Sus scrofa), Indian rock pythons (Python
molurus), Bengal monitor lizards (Varanus bengalensis), and other
species (14). Although not directly attributable to climate change, the
Rohingya refugee crisis serves as an important example of how ongoing
and future climate-induced human population displacements could affect
biodiversity. In many parts of the world, residents will be unwilling to
accept huge influxes of "foreigners" into their communities. Any
remaining natural areas in the vicinity are likely to be targeted for
land conversion and development to support displaced persons. Governance
and funding at national and international scales are woefully inadequate
to mitigate the looming humanitarian and biodiversity crises wrought by
major displacement of climate change refugees (16). [[Climate change
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also reducing---often
**[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}**ly---[[agricultural
output]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} fresh
**[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}** availability in many areas,
[**[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} stresses societies and [**[increases
warfare]{.underline}**]{.mark} (17). The onset of the [civil war in
Syria]{.underline}, for example, [was at least partially caused by a
major drought]{.underline} (18). In Somalia, a drying climate has helped
fuel intranational warfare and refugee movements, which in turn have
exacerbated deforestation (19). Although understudied, the impacts of
more frequent wars on biodiversity could be considerable. Wars destroy
habitat and increase wildlife poaching, leading, for example, to the
extirpation of the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) from half a dozen
countries (20). Warfare displaces people, bankrupts national economies,
and dissolves the financial and political capital to conserve
biodiversity. In many regions, [[climate change will **destabilize**
food security and]{.mark} [access to]{.mark} natural
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Where humans turn for new resources
will profoundly affect ecosystems and species. Globally, humans capture
more than 80 million tons of marine fish per year (21). How will we
replace this protein as commercial stocks decline in warmed and
acidified oceans (2)? Increasing livestock production to compensate
would dramatically increase habitat loss and methane emissions. And
turning from fish to wild meat would rapidly deplete stocks of almost
any terrestrial vertebrate. [Warming temperatures could reduce cereal
crop yields in many regions]{.underline} (22), leading to further
expansion of agriculture, the single biggest driver of habitat loss. In
some areas, even "green energy" solutions, meant to slow the pace of
climate change, are likely to have substantial biodiversity impacts. The
growing renewable energy sector is driving the expansion of mines around
the world, and much of the increased mineral extraction is occurring in
areas set aside for biodiversity conservation. Of the area affected by
mining globally, 16% is in Remaining Wilderness, 8% in Protected Areas,
and 7% in Key Biodiversity Areas (23). Likewise, "clean" energy
infrastructure, such as wind and solar power, require large land
allotments outside of inhabited and agricultural areas, so as to not
negatively impact other societal needs. In other words, renewable energy
expansion will often occur in natural areas, as demonstrated with newly
planned wind farms in Queensland, Australia (24). Taking Action
Understanding and addressing the synergies that we outline here will be
extremely complex. There are huge numbers of scenarios for how [climate
change could affect **warfare**, refugee]{.underline} movements,
agricultural output, [resource]{.underline} extraction, and other
factors, all with large uncertainties and potential interactions with
other processes both known and currently unknown. This complexity makes
it extremely difficult to predict, with any degree of certainty, the
multifarious impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Indeed, such
difficulties could partly explain why climate ecology research has
hitherto focused so heavily on the comparatively simple task of
assessing species' direct vulnerability to abiotic changes.

#### Absent mitigation, [extinction]{.underline}\-\--catastrophic [changes]{.underline} turn the planet into a [hothouse]{.underline} and push the [earth]{.underline} beyond its [limits]{.underline}.

Hence, although the "balance of nature" paradigm is now widely rejected,
many [leading scientists do believe that large-scale natural
[systems]{.mark} on Earth are in some sense delicately bal-
anced]{.underline}. These [systems change over time---they are
inherently dynamic rather than static---but sudden perturbations, on
geological timescales, can [nudge]{.mark} them [beyond]{.mark} certain
critical [thresh-olds]{.mark}, thus [resulting in]{.mark} abrupt,
[catastrophic changes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, [the ideas of
tipping points, critical thresholds, and planetary boundaries gesture at
a revised version of the "balance of na-ture" kill
mechanism]{.underline} that Carson thrust into the forefront of the
public consciousness many decades ago: if humanity trespasses one or
more system boundaries, the effects could be drastic, devastating, and
possibly irreversible (at least on timescales meaningful to
civilization). At the extreme, positive feedback loops could initiate a
runaway greenhouse effect that transmogrifies Earth into a hellish
cauldron like our planetary neighbor Venus, although current scientific
think-ing suggests that this is very unlikely. However, [scientists have
recently proposed that human-induced [changes]{.mark} in the environment
could [push Earth into a]{.mark} "[hothouse]{.mark}" state]{.underline},
after [which cli-mate mitigation efforts like CO2 emissions reductions
will have little effect on the physical con-ditions of
Earth]{.underline}. As Will Steffen, Johan Rockström, Katherine
Richardson, Timothy Lenton, and others explain, [humanity faces
a]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} that [self-reinforcing
[feedbacks]{.mark} could [push]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark} System [toward
a]{.mark} plane-tary [threshold]{.mark} that]{.underline}, [if crossed,
could prevent stabilization of the climate at inter-mediate temperature
rises and [cause]{.mark} continued warming]{.underline} [on
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[Hothouse Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}" [pathway
even [as]{.mark} human [emissions are reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Crossing the threshold would]{.mark} [lead to]{.mark} a much
[higher]{.mark} global average [temperature]{.mark} than any
interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels
significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene]{.underline}. 654

In other words, [[climate change poses a risk to humanity]{.mark} not
just because [it will cause]{.mark} more [extreme weather]{.mark}
events, [food supply disruptions]{.mark}, [megadroughts]{.mark},
devastating [heatwaves]{.mark}]{.underline} (some ex-ceeding the 95
degree F threshold of survivability), [uncontrollable
[wildfires]{.mark}, rising [sea levels]{.mark}, [eco]{.mark}logical
[collapse]{.mark}, mass migrations, political [instability]{.mark},
etc]{.underline}., but [[because]{.mark} [CO2 emissions]{.mark} could,
perhaps without any prior warning, [flip the planet]{.mark} into a
completely new state never before en-countered by Homo
sapiens]{.underline}. As a 2019 paper in the journal *Nature*
co-authored by [many]{.underline} of the [scientists]{.underline}
mentioned above [declares]{.underline}: "[[If]{.mark} damaging [tipping
cascades]{.mark} can occur and a global tip-ping point cannot be ruled
out, then [this is]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark} threat to
civilization."[Such language is]{.mark} especially [unsettling
given]{.mark} that climate [scientists]{.mark} [are]{.mark} notoriously
[conservative in]{.mark} their [predictions]{.mark} and "clinical" in
how they express their warnings. A tipping cascade, though, is an
existential threat]{.underline}. 657

If surviving to see the sun fry Earth is a long shot, when is humanity
likely to meet its doom? Paleontologically, mammalian species usually
persist for about a million years, says Henry Gee, a paleontologist and
senior editor at the journal Nature, whose forthcoming book is on the
extinction of humans. That would put the human species in its youth. But
Gee doesn\'t think these rules necessarily apply for H. sapiens.

\"[Humans are rather an exceptional species]{.underline},\" he says.
\"[We could last for millions of years, or we could all drop down next
week]{.underline}.\"

Opportunities for doomsday abound. [[Humans could]{.mark} be wiped out
by a catastrophic asteroid strike, commit **self-destruction** with
worldwide nuclear war or [succumb to the **ravages caused by the
climate**]{.mark} **emergency**. But humans are a hardy bunch, so [the
**most likely scenario** involves a **combination** of
catastrophes]{.mark} that could eradicate us completely]{.underline}.

Pick Your Poison

Some species killers are out of our control. In a 2021 paper in the
journal Icarus, for example, researchers describe how asteroids
comparable to the one spanning 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter that
killed off the nonavian dinosaurs hit Earth approximately every 250
million to 500 million years. In a preprint paper posted on the server
arXiv.org, physicists Philip Lubin and Alexander N. Cohen calculate that
humanity would have the ability to save itself from a dino-killer-size
asteroid, given six months\' warning and an arsenal of nuclear
penetrators to blow the space rock into a cloud of harmless pebbles.
With less warning or a larger asteroid, Lubin and Cohen suggest,
humanity should give up and \"party\" or \"move to Mars or the Moon to
party.\" Currently the biggest asteroid that scientists know of with the
potential to strike Earth is called (29075) 1950 DA. It is a mere 1,300
meters across and has a one-in-50,000 chance of hitting our world in
March 2880, according to a 2022 risk analysis by the European Space
Agency.

Incoming space rocks aside, [many threats to humanity are of our own
making: **nuclear war**, the **climate** emergency, **ecological
collapse**]{.underline}. We might be done in by our own tech in the form
of sentient artificial intelligence that decides to snuff out its
creators, as some AI critics have suggested.

An all-out nuclear war could easily destroy humanity, says François
Diaz-Maurin, associate editor for nuclear affairs at the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists. The last time humans dropped nuclear bombs on one
another, only one country, the U.S., had nuclear warheads, so there was
no risk of nuclear retaliation. That\'s not the case today---and now the
bombs are a lot bigger. Those older bombs, which struck the Japanese
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, packed the equivalent of 15
and 21 kilotons of TNT, respectively. Together they killed an estimated
110,000 to 210,000 people. A single modern-day, 300-kiloton nuclear
weapon dropped on New York City, for example, would kill a million
people in 24 hours, Diaz-Maurin says. A regional nuclear war, such as
one between India and Pakistan, could kill 27 million people in the
short term, whereas a full-scale nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia
could cause an estimated 360 million direct deaths, he adds.

The threat to humanity\'s very existence would come after the war, when
soot from massive fires ignited by the bombings would rapidly alter the
climate in a scenario known as nuclear winter. Fears of nuclear winter
may have receded since the end of the cold war, Diaz-Maurin says, but
research shows that the environmental consequences would be severe. Even
a regional nuclear war would damage the ozone layer, block out sunlight
and reduce precipitation worldwide. The result would be a global famine
that might kill more than five billion people in just two years,
depending on the size and number of detonations.

\"That possibility of destroying humanity is still here and real,\"
Diaz-Maurin says.

[Death by ecological contamination or the climate emergency would be
slower but still within the realm of possibility. Already humans are
facing health stressors from chronic pollution that have been
exacerbated by the additional heat brought on by climate
change]{.underline}, says Maureen Lichtveld, dean of the School of
Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. [Hotter temperatures
force people to breathe more rapidly to dispel warmth, which draws more
pollution into their lungs. [The **climate emergency**]{.mark} also
**[deepens]{.mark}** existing [problems around **food
security**]{.mark}---for instance, persistent [**drought** can
**devastate cropland**]{.mark}---[and **infectious disease**]{.mark}.
\"[The **interconnectedness** of **climate change**]{.mark} and health
inequities and inequities in general [is what]{.mark} is
**[impact]{.mark}ing our [global population]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline}
Lichtveld says.

The Perfect Storm

Will these inequities eventually lead to a species-wide downfall? It\'s
not easy to calculate the likelihood that, say, the climate emergency
will kill us all, says Luke Kemp, a research affiliate at the Center for
the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. But it\'s
probably not realistic to consider risks individually anyway, he says.

\"[When we look at the history of things like mass extinctions and
societal collapses, it\'s never **just one thing** that
happens]{.underline},\" Kemp says. \"If you\'re trying to rely on a
single silver bullet to kill everyone in a single event, you have to
write sci-fi.\"

[[The end of humanity is]{.mark} far [**more likely** to be brought
about by **multiple factors**]{.mark}, Kemp says---[a **pileup of
disasters**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although apocalyptic movies often turn
to viruses, bacteria and fungi to wipe out huge swathes of the
population, [a pandemic alone probably won\'t drive humanity to
extinction]{.underline} simply because the immune system is a broad and
effective defense, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician
and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. A
pandemic could be devastating and lead to severe upheaval---the Black
Death killed 30 to 50 percent of Europe\'s population---but it\'s
unlikely that a pathogen would kill all of humanity, Adalja says. \"Yes,
an infectious disease could kill a lot of people,\" he says, \"but then
you\'re going to have a group \[of people\] that are resilient to it and
survive.\"

Humans also have tools to fight back against a pathogen, from medical
treatments to vaccines to the social-distancing measures that became
familiar worldwide during the COVID pandemic, Adalja says. There is one
example of a mammalian species that may have been entirely eliminated by
an infectious disease, he says: the Christmas Island rat (Rattus
macleari), also called Maclear\'s rat, an endemic island species that
may have gone extinct because of the introduction of a parasite.

\"We are not helpless like the Christmas Island rat, which couldn\'t get
away from that island,\" Adalja says. \"We have the ability to change
our fate.\"

If infectious disease contributes to the downfall of humanity, [it will
probably be as just **one piece of a larger puzzle**. Imagine [a planet
pushed to upheaval by **sea-level rise** and disruption to
**agriculture** from climate change]{.mark}. The [humans]{.mark} of this
climate-ravaged [world attempt]{.mark} a **[geoengineering]{.mark}
solution** [that **goes wrong**]{.mark}. The situation worsens.
[Resources are **scarce**]{.mark}, and a bunch of [countries have
**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}. Oh, by the way, the [mosquitoes]{.mark}
that [carry **yellow fever**]{.mark} range [as far]{.mark} north [as
Canada in this scenario]{.mark}. It\'s not hard to see how [the human
population could]{.mark} decline and [**disappear** in the face of an
**arsenal of challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Kemp.

Worst-case scenarios are understudied, Kemp says. In climate science,
for example, there is a lot of research into what the world might look
like at two or three degrees Celsius warmer than the preindustrial
average but very little looking at what an increase of five or six
degrees C might look like. This is partly because scientists have a hard
time predicting the effects of that much warming and partly because
climate scientists feel pressure from politicians not to appear
alarmist, Kemp says. Models of future worst-case scenarios also tend to
do an inadequate job of predicting the cascading effects of a disaster.
\"The general field of existential risk is relatively new, nascent and
just understudied,\" Kemp says.

There are questions as to how much humans should worry about something
as big picture as extinction. While some see the question as
pressing---controversial tech billionaires such as Elon Musk and Peter
Thiel have funded organizations dedicated to studying the risks of
transformative technologies---others argue that today\'s problems are
urgent enough. [Already humans are heating the globe, overexploiting and
destroying nature, using land and water unsustainably]{.underline}, and
creating chemicals that are harmful to all life, often in service to the
globally well-off, says Sarah Cornell, who studies global sustainability
at the Stockholm Resilience Center at Stockholm University.

\"Today\'s reality is that some human beings are undermining or even
destroying living conditions of many, many other people,\" Cornell says.
\"[[From]{.mark} a **[human-scale]{.mark}** perspective, [this is an
**existential crisis**]{.mark} already, not a risk somewhere up
ahead]{.underline}.\"
