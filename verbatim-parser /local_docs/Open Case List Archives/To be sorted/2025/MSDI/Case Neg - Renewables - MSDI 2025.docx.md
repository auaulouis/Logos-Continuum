And Norway, Sweden, and Finland are on different sides of the table in
that thinking; of course, in the words of the politicians, they say "oh
yeah, we need to support the green shift and we need to do that" but
[[everyone knows that Norway\'s main focus is still oil and gas
drilling]{.underline}]{.mark}. I mean, that\'s the reason why we are
millionaires.... I used to say that [[the Norwegians are petroholics. We
know that it is bad, but we can\'t resist]{.underline}]{.mark}. We just
need one more drilling, one more oil platform. "No, yeah, put it away",
like alcohol, you know. Just one more. (Interview, Norway other)

[[The Finnish strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} discussed continued fossil
fuel production in Norway. The plans [[were to provide expertise in
cold-climate operations and business for the oil and gas sector,
supporting]{.underline}]{.mark} the regime in [[both
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} (prior to 2022) [[and
Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}, an issue that was also mentioned in the
interviews. Although we detected only a few direct references in the
strategies to keeping the Arctic area inhabited explicitly through these
plans, it is reasonable to assume that one way to gain positive security
was to connect regime support and unsustainable energy production to
security justifications, even in Finland, which has no oil and gas
production.

#### SQ Norway strategy is JOINT production

5.3. Regime support

[[In the Norwegian strategies, the electricity transmission network
development was connected to new petroleum and other business activity
in the High North, suggesting support for rather than the decline of the
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}. The 2011 strategy posited [[energy as a
significant part of future efforts to develop Arctic
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}; this [[would be primarily oil and
gas]{.underline}]{.mark}, but there would also be renewable energy -- an
example of positive security thinking, as the developing energy sector
would boost population growth and create prosperity beyond the energy
sector. These views were echoed in the interviews, with an
acknowledgment of the negative effects of climate change that were
viewed as jeopardising positive development.

[[The Norwegian strategies pointed out that the renewable energy sector
of the northern areas would not be developed on its own. Rather, it
would be developed **in connection to fossil fuel**
production]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [[the
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout frame the production of
fossil fuels as according with sustainable development goals. They [[do
not consider the whole chain from production to end consumption and the
emissions of usage]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus only allowing discussion
at a broad and partial level. One niche beyond fossil fuel production to
be developed is bioenergy from algae. However, the 2009 strategy did not
consider its potential to be strong, thus, managing expectations already
in the beginning. Although [[hydropower]{.underline}]{.mark} can be
understood as part of the regime due to its long history and abundant
energy production, it [[too was harnessed to support plans for fossil
fuel energy production]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arctic petro states disrupt climate transition

We used transformative outcomes (TOs): the three macro-processes and 12
sub-processes \[19\] for data analysis. However, the analysis showed
that, in the European Arctic context, the findings could mainly be
presented in the level of macro-processes (merging niche development
with niche expansion and regime decline). [[Due to the strong support
given still to fossil fuels in the region, we added a category of regime
support]{.underline}]{.mark} to the analysis. Previous research on
[[Eurasian Arctic regimes has shown that the state as a regulatory and
funding body is so closely connected to fossil fuel production in the
area that powerful pressure from the regime has facilitated continued
action]{.underline}]{.mark} \[2,3\].

### 1NC \-- Solvency -- No Governance

#### AC fails -- Ukraine tensions

In the Finnish interviews, [[the EU\'s call to ban fossil fuel
production in the Arctic was frequently mentioned]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Although [[many described it as **inefficient**, suggesting its status
as **merely ceremonial** and yet to be determined in practice, the
possibility was regarded as an important opening]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This can be interpreted as an attempt to change perceptions of the
seriousness of climate change. [[The Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, an intergovernmental forum promoting
cooperation in the Arctic, [[was discussed as a good
structure]{.underline}]{.mark} for monitoring and knowledge
dissemination in climate change mitigation and adaptation. While the
Arctic Council is not a security actor, this can be interpreted as
providing positive security by offering a platform to broaden the
epistemological foundation on which discussions are based, although the
Council officially does not deal with issues of negative security.
[[Arctic cooperation was seen as a major challenge due to **Russia\'s
war in Ukraine**, which has created palpable military security
**pressure** on energy transitions and sustainable
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, its actual effectiveness in
relation to the transition was questioned: "[[The Arctic Council is a
**paper tiger** on this issue.... Oil and gas drilling are and have
always been part of their inventories, and the academic
community]{.underline}]{.mark} is doing a good job, but this [[has had
**no effect** on decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Interview,
Finland, researcher).

#### Arctic cooperation improbable given diverging interests

6-23-2025)

The susceptibility of the Arctic to climate change has led to several
international efforts aimed at encouraging international cooperation,
although the efficacy of these efforts varies \[242\]. [[The Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, formed in 1996, [[is the
premier]{.underline}]{.mark} intergovernmental
[[platform]{.underline}]{.mark} for Arctic governments and Indigenous
communities \[243,244\]. It has played an important role in producing
critical reports, such as the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA),
which highlights the multifaceted effects of warming on the region
\[245\]. The Council supports research and sustainable resource use
through initiatives, such as the Agreement on Enhancing International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017) and the Agreement to Prevent
Unregulated Fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean (2018) \[75\].
[[However, its inability to impose legally binding controls on carbon
emissions or industrial activity limits its overall
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Paris Agreement (2015), while
global in scope, indirectly addresses Arctic warming by aiming to keep
the global temperature rise to well below 2 °C \[246\]. Arctic-specific
solutions, such as enhanced financial support for adaptation in polar
regions or tighter timelines for emissions reductions in high-latitude
countries, are noticeably lacking \[247\]. Similarly, the Polar Code,
produced by the International Maritime Organisation, establishes rules
for Arctic shipping but calls for broader coverage to offset the hazards
of increased commercial activity, such as stronger limits on black
carbon emissions and ballast water discharge \[248\]. [[The **lack** of
comprehensive agreements explicitly designed to **address** Arctic
concerns, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} regulating [[oil and
gas]{.underline}]{.mark} development [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
overseeing [[geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} experiments,
[[emphasises the need for more international action. Proposals for a
binding]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic Climate
[[Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}, similar to the Antarctic Treaty System,
[[remain contentious due to **competing interests among** Arctic states
and industry]{.underline}]{.mark} \[249\].

#### Governance frameworks are insufficient to address competing arctic interests

6-23-2025)

Climate change is causing significant environmental and socioeconomic
changes in the Arctic, necessitating the implementation of strong
governance frameworks and adaptation strategies. The combination of
global climate dynamics, Indigenous knowledge systems, and geopolitical
interests has made the Arctic a focus for scientific research and policy
intervention. [[The Arctic Council serves as a major forum for
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} among Arctic nations and Indigenous
organisations \[266\]. It has played an important role in addressing
concerns, such as environmental preservation and sustainable
development, but its non-binding agreements impede enforcement \[32\].
[[Despite these efforts, gaps exist in the management of challenges,
such as increased shipping, resource extraction, and environmental
deterioration]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, the [[rapid
melting]{.underline}]{.mark} of sea ice [[has increased geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} for shipping routes and mineral
resources, [[emphasising the need for stronger legal
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} \[36,50,267\]. [[International
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea, [[provide legal processes for settling
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly those involving marine
boundaries \[268\]. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are concerns
that [[these frameworks are insufficient to handle the Arctic's rapid
environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[212\]. The Arctic Fisheries
Agreement of 2018, which outlaws unregulated fishing in the central
Arctic Ocean, is a recent example of effective international cooperation
\[269\].

#### Oil Dependence disrupts the transition, magnifies DA links

[[Regime support was scarcely discussed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
interviews, [[although several participants mentioned the improbability
of simply halting oil and gas production due to the economic dependence
of]{.underline}]{.mark} four Arctic states: [[Russia, the United States,
Canada and Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the interviews were conducted
[[after Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, this was directly connected to
hard security issues of protecting the state]{.underline}]{.mark}, its
assets and its claims of sovereignty over maritime areas. [[This
highlights the importance of more diverse paradigms that the framing of
positive security allows]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1NC \-- Solvency -- No Modeling

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} has several [[research
gaps]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[limit effective climate action
and]{.underline}]{.mark} equitable [[policy
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly for Indigenous Peoples
and the ecosystem. [[An important gap is the **poor inclusion** of
Indigenous knowledge systems into **larger** scientific
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}
communities have built up extensive, [[place-based
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} about Arctic ecosystems over generations,
which [[is underutilised in scientific and policy
discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} \[285\]. The lack of
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} knowledge [[reduces the cultural
significance and efficacy of adaptation strategies]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly those aimed at traditional livelihoods, like hunting,
fishing, and reindeer herding. The detailed overview of the key research
gaps identified in this study is given in Supplementary Table S1.
Studies that combine Indigenous knowledge with science are critical for
developing inclusive policies that empower communities and strengthen
their resilience. Beyond Indigenous-specific gaps, larger ecological and
socioeconomic uncertainties persist. There is a lack of understanding
about Arctic marine ecosystems, specifically the combined effects of
ocean acidification, changing sea ice dynamics, and altered food webs.
Polar bears, walruses, and Arctic cod are among the species at risk due
to these conditions, which threaten both ecological equilibrium and
Indigenous sustenance. Economic gaps include a lack of comprehensive
appraisals of growing industries, such as Arctic shipping and resource
extraction. The effects of infrastructure expansion on vulnerable
permafrost and ecosystems are poorly understood, [[leaving important
concerns unanswered]{.underline}]{.mark}. These research gaps and future
goals highlight the need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach
to Arctic climate research, which ensures that scientific understanding
keeps up with the rapid changes taking place in this crucial area.
[[Addressing these gaps necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark}
interdisciplinary research, [[more collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}
between Arctic and non-Arctic nations, [[and a focus on participatory
techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} that incorporate Indigenous perspectives
at all stages of development. By addressing these research gaps, the
Arctic can serve as a paradigm for integrated, sustainable, and
inclusive climate response.

Despite growing interest in Arctic climate change, several key research
gaps remain. These include limited high-resolution data across space and
seasons, insufficient integration of interacting climate drivers (e.g.,
greenhouse gases, albedo, and atmospheric dynamics), and unclear
linkages between Arctic warming and mid-latitude weather extremes.
Moreover, [[local-scale impacts on ecosystems and Indigenous communities
are underexplored, and observational
data]{.underline}]{.mark}---especially in remote and winter-dominated
regions---[[remain sparse]{.underline}]{.mark}. This study contributes
by synthesising multiple drivers and highlighting the Arctic's role as a
critical zone of interconnected global change.

### 1NC \-- Solvency -- RE Fails

#### Government control undermines arctic RE

Gwen **Holdmann**, 20**25**, Alaska Center for Energy and Power,
**U**niversity of **Alaska** Fairbanks and Richard Wies Electrical and
Computer Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Mines,
University of Alaska Fairbanks, \"Harnessing the Arctic Wind: How Alaska
became a leader in wind energy microgrids.\" IEEE Electrification
Magazine 13.2 (2025): 6-15.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11023057 (ermo-MSDI, acc
6-23-2025)

These [[innovations did not stem from a single
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} shift or technological breakthrough.
Instead, [[Alaska's rapid adoption of wind energy resulted from a
convergence of economic]{.underline}]{.mark} pressures,
[[technological]{.underline}]{.mark} advancements,
[[local]{.underline}]{.mark} ingenuity, [[and
sustained]{.underline}]{.mark} public [[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This article explores how Alaska became a leader in wind--diesel
microgrids, the challenges that remain in scaling these solutions, and
the lessons Alaska offers to other remote communities.

Context: Why Alaska?

Alaska's extreme conditions (harsh weather, logistical challenges, and
high fuel costs) have created strong incentives to find ways to reduce
reliance on diesel. These challenges are not unique to Alaska; [[many
remote Arctic communities]{.underline}]{.mark} and islanded nations in
non-Arctic locations also [[rely on diesel. Yet, Alaska has emerged as a
leader]{.underline}]{.mark} in pioneering wind--diesel microgrid
solutions. Several factors have contributed to this outcome:

x Economic pressures as a catalyst for innovation: The high cost of
imported fuel has driven utilities and policy makers to explore
alternatives. In 2023, rural Alaska communities paid an average of
US\$0.55/kWh, with many residents facing a severe energy burden. In this
high-cost environment, [[even modest diesel
displacement]{.underline}]{.mark} with wind energy [[can
generate]{.underline}]{.mark} significant savings, making [[renewable
integration]{.underline}]{.mark} economically viable [[without
additional subsidies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

x Institutional and policy support: Alaska's energy landscape has
facilitated innovation in several ways. [[A largely deregulated utility
industry allows for swift, locally driven decision
making]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, key state programs such as
the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) helped derisk early investments in wind
power, and research centers such as the Alaska Center for Energy and
Power provide technical support to communities.

x [[A culture of pragmatic experimentation]{.underline}]{.mark}: Early
adopters of wind--diesel microgrids in Alaska could not afford to wait
for fully developed solutions. Utilities and communities had to test,
refine, and sometimes discard technologies that failed in Arctic
conditions. This iterative approach to problem solving, akin to an agile
energy transition, allowed Alaska's microgrids to evolve rapidly.

Moreover, [[environmental technology]{.underline}]{.mark}
([EVT]{.underline}) is essential to environmental quality and is
strategic in economic transformation and development. Technological
advancements during the industrial revolution have changed economies,
improved the processing of already-produced goods, encouraged RET, and
expanded energy efficiency, ultimately improving environmental quality
\[18\]. Moreover, prior studies have argued that the [[fast
integration]{.underline}]{.mark} of EVT [[can help]{.underline}]{.mark}
monitor and mitigate CEM \[19, 20\]. Nevertheless,
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} extant [[analyses have demonstrated that
EVT increases enterprises' **demand** for power
consumption]{.underline}]{.mark} to run operations. These studies also
argue that [[advanced EVT]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
heavy, [[highly ene**rgy intensive**, and adversary contributes to
lessening CEM]{.underline}]{.mark} \[21, 22\]. This evidence has
demonstrated that [[the connection between EVT and CEM is still
**unclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} and requires further analysis.

### 1NC \-- Solvency -- Uniformity Turn

Lastly, [[it is crucial to **tailor** policy recommendations to Arctic
nations' specific characteristics and contexts]{.underline}]{.mark},
including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the
United States. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} countries have [[unique
economic, environmental, and social landscapes influencing their EVG and
climate action]{.underline}]{.mark} approach. For instance, [Canada and
the United States]{.underline}, with vast northern territories and
significant indigenous populations, [may focus on integrating
traditional ecological knowledge]{.underline} and prioritizing
community-driven sustainable development initiatives that respect
indigenous rights and livelihoods. [Denmark, through Greenland, has
distinct challenges]{.underline} related to its remote, small
communities, and could benefit from localized renewable energy solutions
like wind and hydropower, which align with its existing renewable energy
strengths. [Finland and Sweden]{.underline}, with advanced technology
sectors, [could lead in]{.underline} the [development of cutting-edge
environmental technologies and innovations]{.underline}, such as
advanced biofuels or smart grids, leveraging their strong research and
innovation capacities. With its significant investments in hydroelectric
power and a history of leadership in maritime technology, Norway could
prioritize enhancing cleaner maritime transport and expanding its
existing clean energy infrastructure. Given its vast natural resources
and heavy reliance on fossil fuels, [Russia may need to focus on
diversifying its energy mix]{.underline} and improving energy
efficiency, particularly in industrial sectors, while navigating complex
political and economic landscapes. Also, with its large and varied
Arctic region, [[the United States could **leverage** its technological
capabilities and economic resources to drive large-scale renewable
energy projects]{.underline}]{.mark} and robust EVG frameworks. By
considering these varied characteristics, the policy directions can be
more relevant and impactful, [[ensuring that each Arctic nation's
**unique** strengths and challenges are addressed in the collective
effort]{.underline}]{.mark} to improve environmental quality
[[**across** the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## Solvency - Turns

### 1NC \-- Settlement Turn

#### Plan facilitates open source RE housing in Greenland -- overcomes diesel dependence

<https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/dissertations/281> (ermo-MSDI, acc
6-21-2025)

5.2 Future Work This research could be expanded on in several meaningful
ways and adapted to meet community needs around the Arctic or
communities in highly centralized governmental systems or remote areas.
The first potential future pathway is identifying and [[implementing
policy and financial tools for overcoming diesel
dependence]{.underline}]{.mark} in locations with high energy or fuel
subsidies and/or centralized utilities and governments. There is a
significant knowledge gap in the specific tools that [[would enable
community leaders to become]{.underline}]{.mark} meaningful
[[stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} in energy planning under these
conditions. There is also a gap in knowledge on how to lower energy
subsidies, [[incentivize renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy
([[and]{.underline}]{.mark} de-incentivize fossil fuel-based energy
consumption) while [[protect]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark} members of
[[communities]{.underline}]{.mark} who depend on energy subsidies. This
would require a thorough understanding of community and national energy
goals and developing place-based economic and energy frameworks. The
second pathway for expanding this research is developing [[the MILP
model]{.underline}]{.mark} into an [[open-sourced]{.underline}]{.mark}
platform that can be utilized by Nukissiorfiit or communities across
Greenland. This [[could allow]{.underline}]{.mark} communities across
[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} to begin energy planning or finding
[[solar PV and BES combinations that]{.underline}]{.mark} would help
them meet their energy goals. The program could be simplified to allow
for open-sourced optimization solvers to handle fewer variables (for
example, reduce the time step from hourly to daily. Although this may
not present a realistic dispatch order for battery operation, it would
converge on a reasonable capacity addition to meet community goals.
Lastly, within this MILP program, stochastic load forecasting would
enhance the accuracy of the model and be a useful tool for Nukissiorfiit
in their research. Several research tools can [[effectively predict load
profiles for rural, isolated communities]{.underline}]{.mark} using
field data and surveys of residents \[149\].

#### Arctic urbanization drives ecological disruption

[[URT was demonstrated to have a favorable and substantial influence on
CEM]{.underline}]{.mark} by 0.782% for the DSK method and 0.488 for
FMOLS [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} countries. This finding is in
tandem with the theoretical proposition of this research by revealing
that [[as URT accelerates in the Arctic communities, driven
by]{.underline}]{.mark} indicators such as [[population growth and
economic expansion, infrastructure development, and energy use have
increased in tandem, raising CEM. The shift from a traditional lifestyle
to a more urbanized setting often involves greater dependence
on]{.underline}]{.mark} transportation, [[fossil
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, and heating, [[which contribute
substantially to CEM]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the Arctic nations,
issues such as land use, expanding industrial activities, and the demand
for modern amenities have intensified the carbon footprint in these
areas. Previous extant analysis aligns with a positive nexus between URT
and CEM. These studies argue that [[while URT brings an improved
standard of living, it often accompanies a surge in carbon-intensive
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} \[5, 79\]. Nevertheless, an analysis
presents conflicting evidence, suggesting that the URT can reduce CEM
\[80, 81\].

While these changes have potential economic advantages, they also
represent major risks to the environment. [[Increased industrial
activity can cause pollution, habitat degradation, and social impacts,
which disproportionately affect Indigenous communities that rely on
Arctic ecosystem stability and resources]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[214,215\]. The possibility of [[transboundary conflicts over
resource]{.underline}]{.mark} claims [[emphasises the need for strong
governance frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} that balance economic
development, environmental conservation, and community rights \[205\].
Despite these constraints, Arctic communities have demonstrated
extraordinary resilience through adaptive techniques and policy
initiatives. Indigenous knowledge systems, which emphasise sustainable
resource use and community-based monitoring, are crucial in responding
to climate change \[203,216\]. Co-management of wildlife resources, for
example, and the development of renewable energy initiatives minimise
reliance on foreign supply while also mitigating environmental harm
\[217\]. At the policy level, efforts, like the Arctic Council and
national adaptation programs, aim to boost resilience by encouraging
collaboration among local, national, and international stakeholders
\[212\]. These efforts underscore the need of combining scientific
research with Indigenous knowledge to provide equitable and effective
solutions \[218\] for the Arctic's rapidly changing climate.

[[Other justifications for hindering the transition in the Arctic were
related to long distances, sparsely populated areas, disputes over land
use and claims of ownership]{.underline}]{.mark} and user rights among
Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations and the technological
challenges of cold climates. Previous research has also pointed out
[[the general populations´ concerns over "green grabbing" and
"Europeanization" in Norway, where]{.underline}]{.mark} legal and
physical [[control over renewable energy development is gradually
transferred to the EU, away from Norway]{.underline}]{.mark} \[76\].
Overall, land use questions are especially tightly bound up with
questions of human rights \[67\], an issue that was discussed in the
interviews but was absent in the strategy documents of both countries.
In Finland, the new Sámi Climate Council could be a fruitful body to
strengthen regime-niche interactions in a fair manner by allowing
non-state actors to have a role in decision-making, if under a mandate
of the state. It is yet to be seen what actual impact the council will
have over the medium and long term. Additionally, the role of the Sámi
Parliament could be enhanced in the decision-making.

The united global goal, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and [[to
transition to greener energy]{.underline}]{.mark} forms, [[directly
impacts Indigenous communities in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Currently, [[the Just Green Transition is dependent]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[upon mineral extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}, extraction that often
takes place [[on Indigenous land]{.underline}]{.mark} in the name of the
"Green New Deal" (Robbins and Zografos, 2020). This has been [[termed
"Green Colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}," the phrase was first used by
Aili Keskitalo, the former president of the Sámi Parliament in Norway,
to describe the impact of extractive industries and energy development
projects on Indigenous land (Normann, 2022, pg. 13; Saami-Council,
2017). Whilst [[there are undoubtedly detrimental
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} of mining in the Arctic, with many of
these impacts being deemed [[acts of "Green
Colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}" it is remiss to not acknowledge the
multifaceted benefits of this resource extraction.
[[Whether]{.underline}]{.mark} or not [[impacts are positive or negative
can vary]{.underline}]{.mark} depending on the scale or perspective of
the problem. We therefore present specific examples from different
regions of the Arctic below.

### 1NC \-- Security Turn

#### Reworking securitization enables non-linear disruptive transition to overcome path dependencies

[[Security is tied to Arctic energy transitions]{.underline}]{.mark} in
different ways. [[The area continues to be of geopolitical importance to
major global superpowers, including]{.underline}]{.mark} militarisation
by [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} \[6\] [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} \[7\]. Meanwhile, [[disputes over land use
rights]{.underline}]{.mark} at local and regional levels [[cause active
disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} to Arctic residents\' lives \[8,9\],
posing more local effects on security. Hence, this paper takes the nexus
of zero‑carbon energy transitions and security in the Arctic as its
focus. It combines sustainability transitions research with sociology
and the concepts of positive and negative security to conduct analysis
of this nexus pertaining to Norwegian and Finnish Arctic areas.

[[Zero‑carbon transitions are "disruptive, contested and non-linear
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}" (\[10\], p. 464), [[which require
cultural and political changes that are difficult to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [[to capture the complexity of
transitions, a socio-technical lens is often used]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[10\]. Sustainability transitions research is essentially interested in
how socio-technical systems change to become more environmentally and
socially sustainable. It thus offers a fruitful avenue to examine Arctic
issues, [[as Arctic challenges related to sustainability are diverse in
scale, systems of governance, and the actors
involved]{.underline}]{.mark} \[11,12\]. In terms of sustainable
production and consumption, [[several challenges are regarded as
significant to lock-ins: strong path dependencies, institutional and
cultural obstacles and obstructing practices \[13\]. In the Arctic,
these are all **amplified**]{.underline}]{.mark} with extreme weather
conditions, global interests and local conditions enabling a good life.

A frequently used framework to study sustainability transitions is [[the
multi-level perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} (MLP) which addresses
changes [[in socio-technical systems]{.underline}]{.mark} \[10\]. Such
systems are formed and [[become relatively stable over
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, so the complementary elements of
technologies, infrastructure, rules and practices resist change due to
path dependencies.

Drawing from security studies, we use the [[concepts of positive and
negative security]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[understand the
dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} more broadly during the socio-technical
system change. Originally introduced to broaden from state- and
threat-centred security thinking (i.e. negative security), [[positive
security]{.underline}]{.mark} emphasises the importance of human
perception in international relations theorisation \[14\] and [[offers
an alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} to the traditional negative security
-oriented approach \[15\]. Positive security has been used to refer to
conditions that improve human wellbeing and promote peace by enabling
communities and individuals \[16,17\].

Previous research has shown that, although national and international
policy-making encourages cleaner energy production and consumption,
[[inertia perpetuates the resource extraction
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Eurasian Arctic \[2,18\]. In this
paper, we investigate two national perspectives on the Arctic,
comprising Lapland in Finland and the "High North" in Norway. Norway is
a major oil and gas exporter with a long coastline and keen interests
also in fisheries, on-shore energy production, security and cooperation
between other Arctic states. Unlike Norway, Finland has no coastline nor
oil and gas in the Arctic but increased interests in military and
security cooperation within NATO member states and significant mineral
deposits and wind energy potential. However, both countries\' plans are
not without disputes regarding land use conflicts, growing needs of the
tourism sector and the responsibilities to ensure the indigenous
people\'s traditional way of life. The two countries are officially
committed to climate change mitigation via the Paris Agreement. Finland
is a European Union (EU) member state, while Norway complies with some
EU legislation via its signature to the European Economic Area (EEA)
agreement.

Based on previous research, our hypothesis is that issues regarded as
negative security are used to justify military presence in the Arctic
and continued fossil fuel extraction, thus prompting a hindered
transition. Further, the paper aims to answer two questions: How are
energy transitions and security intertwined in the Finnish and Norwegian
Arctic, and what are the justifications for hindered transitions?

As sustainability transitions are deeply political processes \[19\],
this study contributes to understanding political discourse, called for
in the transitions literature \[20\]. To capture the processes of
[[sustainability transitions in the Norwegian and Finnish
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, we [[concentrate on niche- and regime-level
interaction]{.underline}]{.mark} and pay attention to the actors that
influence and navigate sustainability transitions \[21\].

#### Security evolution is complicated & difficult -- disrupts arctic climate transitions

Marja Helena **Sivonen**, 20**25** **SYKE** Finnish Environment

In our strategy document analysis, we did not find many mentions of
regime decline in either Finland or Norway. In fact, we created a new
code for the support the regime received in those documents. [[In
Norway, support for fossil fuel production correlates well with national
ambitions and policies]{.underline}]{.mark} \[79\]. However in Finland,
phasing out fossil fuels is an important part of national climate and
energy strategies \[80\]. The support that [[Arctic strategies appeared
to show for continued fossil fuel production or use in both
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} connects to positive and negative notions
of security. [[In negative security thinking]{.underline}]{.mark},
military and national interests, sovereignty and landownership are
central. This is present when [[Norway claims sea areas with oil and gas
industry installations and]{.underline}]{.mark} when [[economic
advancements in Finland are sought from cold-climate
technology]{.underline}]{.mark} development,
[[enabling]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[winter passage and
machine durability]{.underline}]{.mark}. The connection to positive
security can be found in both countries\' aims to keep remote areas
inhabited by enabling safe socio-economic wellbeing that will encourage
people to stay in the area. Infrastructure and other state-provided
basic living condition elements are needed to keep people in the north,
along with cultural, political and technical solutions that can offer
the same living standards as in the south. Here, positive security as a
multi-actor discursive practice \[15\] provides a useful perspective;
the Norwegian strategies claim support of and possibilities for local
and Indigenous populations to take part in decision-making, but our
analysis echoes previous research that more is needed \[9,81\]. This is
significant because [[democratising security thinking can foster change
in practice. However, it is by no means an easy process, from
ontological differences]{.underline}]{.mark} \[8\] [[through land use
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the costs and benefits of, for instance,
[[mining activities]{.underline}]{.mark} \[82\]. [[The latter may either
contrast energy transitions with security]{.underline}]{.mark} (when
energy-related land use threatens reindeer herding or broader
environmental security) [[or align them]{.underline}]{.mark} (when
mining creates employment in the north and supports the energy
transition), [[showing the complexities of the energy-security
nexus]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is experiencing the impact of climate
change much faster than other parts of the world. Whilst warming
climates expand access to navigation opportunities and untapped mineral
resources, they at the same time bring lasting impacts on the wellbeing
of its people and the environment. Additionally, [[resource extraction,
including raw materials for **low carbon** technology, has the potential
to **disrupt** the social, cultural, and ecological wellbeing in
project-affected areas]{.underline}]{.mark} (Larsen and Ingimundarson,
2023). [[This is the **Arctic paradox**, where our need for solutions to

The collected literature was methodically organised into [[major themes,

ecosystem alterations, socioeconomic implications, and policy
responses]{.underline}]{.mark}. A thematic content analysis was carried
out to analyse recurring trends, causal relationships, and emerging
challenges across these themes. This method focused [[on feedback
mechanisms, such as ice--albedo interactions and permafrost--carbon
dynamics, as well as their consequences for global
climate]{.underline}]{.mark} systems. Second, the study critically
synthesised [[emerging patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}, linking findings
to regional and global contexts. Visualisation tools, [[such

[[trends in Arctic warming, sea ice loss]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
ecosystem impact. Figures were created to represent various phenomena,

Finally, knowledge gaps and future research goals were identified using
a gap analysis approach. This includes [[comparing]{.underline}]{.mark}
current findings [[to existing policy and governance
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}, emphasising the importance of
interdisciplinary and participatory approaches. [[The incorporation of

To answer the first research question of how renewable energy and
security are intertwined, we can say that they were connected to each
other on various ways. In both countries, [[land use disputes over wind
production, minerals mining and expanding electricity transmission
networks]{.underline}]{.mark} were directly discussed as positive
security issues, as "the everyday" is intricate to those developments.
They [[imply significant changes to the inhabitants,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Sámi also [[their right to their
traditional culture and way of life]{.underline}]{.mark}. Security was
defined to be of multi-actor premises, where ability to participate in
decision-making and defining what security is and to whom it should be
provided when energy transitions proceed was highlighted. As our
analysis has revealed, notions of justice are deeply an aspect of
security. Indeed, many interviewees wished to discuss issues of
injustice in the context of security, even when not directly asked about
them.

[[Declines in]{.underline}]{.mark} the utilization of and [[access to
traditional food systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a shift to non-local
foods [[are further entrenched by policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
[[imposed by non-Indigenous governments. Often, such policies
address]{.underline}]{.mark} food security concerns by facilitating food
imports. This is well exemplified in governmental programs that address
Arctic [[food security through]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing access to
[[non-traditional foods]{.underline}]{.mark}: for example, the
"\[Canadian\] Nutrition North Program, was introduced in 2011 to make
healthy foods more accessible by providing food transportation subsidies
to retailers" 12. Consequently, a significant portion of the food supply
in Arctic communities consists of non-traditional food, [[such as
processed foods]{.underline}]{.mark}, canned goods or packaged snacks,
[[that is expensive and]{.underline}]{.mark} tends to [[create
nutritional imbalances]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Another consequence of [[government programs]{.underline}]{.mark} is the
promotion of agricultural activities that are not traditional in the
Arctic region, such as growing vegetables and herbs and providing fresh
produce. Modern greenhouse techniques, hydroponics, and aquaponics are
being explored, especially where soil and climate do not support
land-based farming. These approaches [[perpetuate
import-driven]{.underline}]{.mark} changes in [[dietary
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} and solidify such shifts: food types that
were non-local traditionally are now more and more being produced
locally---[[at the cost of increased energy usage]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Nevertheless, [[developing non-traditional food production without
meaningful input from local communities is a road to
failure]{.underline}]{.mark}13. What is technically possible and
desirable for settler communities (e.g., the industry driven Arctic Food
Arena Project14) is not necessarily desirable for Indigenous
communities15

The Arctic is host to a huge diversity of mineral deposits and
geological environments including Archaean to Proterozoic greenstone
belts, Proterozoic to Mesozoic large igneous provinces and large
sedimentary basins of multiple ages (Harrison and St-Onge, 2023; Figure
1). The Arctic is also host to a range of [[critical metals such as Ni,
Zn, REEs and Cu]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[are essential for renewable
technologies, such as wind]{.underline}]{.mark} turbines [[and
solar]{.underline}]{.mark} panels (Boyd et al., 2016). [[There are
numerous world-class deposits]{.underline}]{.mark} found [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} which have produced significant amounts of
raw materials [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} Red Dog Zn-Pb mine in
northern [[Alaska and]{.underline}]{.mark} Norilsk Ni-Pd mine in
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Kiruna Mine, located in northern
[[Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, is one of the world's largest underground
iron-ore mines. Similarly, Raglan mine in the Nunavik region of
[[Quebec]{.underline}]{.mark} is a large nickel mining complex dating

Examples of Indigenous/Community Led Initiatives

[[Since]{.underline}]{.mark} the introduction of international
instruments such as [[UNDRIP, FPIC and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[ILO]{.underline}]{.mark} Convention No. [[169]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[there has been an increase in Indigenous-led
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many of these have been
[[focused]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically [[on the green
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Securing Indigenous Peoples' Rights in
the Green Economy ([[SIRGE]{.underline}]{.mark} coalition) is one
example of an Indigenous-led initiative. This coalition [[is led by an
Indigenous Steering Committee]{.underline}]{.mark} which is made up of
two representatives of Indigenous Peoples [[from each of the seven
socio-cultural regions]{.underline}]{.mark} across the globe. SIRGE
implements transformative solutions to secure the rights of Indigenous
Peoples in the global transition to a green economy. This organisation
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} recently [[released a guide
for]{.underline}]{.mark} Indigenous leaders to develop [[FPIC
protocols]{.underline}]{.mark} and to implement these [[to ensure
self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark} is reified for all Indigenous
community members.

Another example of Indigenous communities heading initiatives within the
extractive sector is [[in Alberta]{.underline}]{.mark} where the Frog
Lake First Nations and the Kehewin Cree Nation are proposing [[an
Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}-led carbon capture and storage
([[CCS]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[hub]{.underline}]{.mark} located on their
traditional territory. Whilst these communities are partnered with
Kanata Clean Power and Climate Technologies Corp. and Vault 44.01 Ltd.,

Blended Arctic food systems

[[There are growing movements in the Indigenous
North]{.underline}]{.mark}, often within communities,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} aim to both [[preserve traditional food
practices and integrate beneficial]{.underline}]{.mark} aspects of
[[modern food]{.underline}]{.mark} systems. While variably and
increasingly heterogeneous, current Arctic food systems must, at the
same time, target food sovereignty and address changing conditions, such
as economic growth, rapid, climate-driven ecosystem changes, and food
security. [[This can be accomplished by embracing locally adaptable
innovations that optimize traditional food systems and increase local
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}for producing food that both meets local
demand and satisfies markets for imported foods. People in the Arctic
regions need food that utilizes local fuels for heat and production and
is primarily cultivated, harvested, prepared, preserved, shared, sold,
or traded within the boundaries of Indigenous respective territories,
while allowing for additional ways to produce foods for export to
regional and global markets.

National policies in Arctic nations vary significantly, reflecting
different priorities in balancing economic development and environmental
conservation \[250\]. Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
prioritises sustainable development, renewable energy transitions, and
climate resilience, while also incorporating Indigenous knowledge into
government policies to some extent \[251\]. In contrast, Russia's Arctic
strategy focusses on resource extraction, particularly oil, gas, and
minerals, and prioritises economic gains over environmental preservation
\[252\]. The Nordic countries have adopted ambitious green policies,
such as transitioning to renewable energy and promoting marine protected
areas, but there are still challenges in reducing emissions from the
expanding maritime and tourism industries \[253\]. [[Indigenous
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, important to the Arctic's social and
biological systems, [[are becoming more active in
policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark} \[50\]. [[Co-management initiatives
demonstrate the importance of combining traditional ecological knowledge
and scientific research]{.underline}]{.mark} to develop culturally
sensitive adaptation strategies \[254\]. Indigenous knowledge has proven
[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark} useful [[in monitoring climate
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as changes in species migration and
permafrost degradation \[255\]. However, the United Nations Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[emphasises]{.underline}]{.mark} the importance of increased
[[political and financial empowerment]{.underline}]{.mark} in order to
promote fair participation in decision making \[256\]. [[Indigenous
organisations advocate for greater influence in shaping regional and
national policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly those governing
land use, resource extraction, and conservation \[40,257,258\].

[[collaborating]{.underline}]{.mark} on research with Indigenous
stakeholders has [[resulted in a better knowledge and management of
ecological changes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[30,31,32,274\]. Thawing
permafrost and coastal erosion pose significant dangers to Arctic
infrastructure, such as buildings, pipelines, and transportation
networks \[19,275\]. [[Engineering]{.underline}]{.mark} solutions, such
as permafrost-resistant materials and coastal defence systems, are being
deployed, but their [[high cost and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[distant
locations of Arctic communities prevent widespread
adoption]{.underline}]{.mark} \[276,277,278\]. Policies that prioritise
climate-resilient infrastructure are important for mitigating these
risks \[152,279,280\].

Ecosystem-based adaptation strategies prioritise biodiversity
conservation and habitat restoration in order to preserve ecosystem
services that benefit communities \[281\]. Arctic wetlands, for example,
play an important role in carbon sequestration and water control; hence,
their preservation is a priority \[22\]. Protecting vital habitats for
migratory species has become an important adaptation strategy \[23\].
Integrating climate adaptation into national and regional strategies is
critical for good governance. [[Participatory scenario
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}, which combines multiple stakeholder
viewpoints, including those of Indigenous communities, [[has proven
effective in developing adaptive management
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} \[282\]. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark},
research shows that [[it frequently fails to fully integrate with
Indigenous practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, emphasising the need for more
inclusive approaches \[282\]. Cooperative agreements, such as the Arctic
Fisheries Agreement, illustrate the possibility for multilateral
governance, but gaps exist in addressing the security implications of
rising human activity in the region \[36,50\]. [[Strengthening
international agreements on Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} shipping,
fishing, and [[resource management is important for
balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[development
and]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental
[[sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The snow- and ice-covered mountains of Lofoten in Norway provided a
truly dramatic and breathtaking backdrop to the workshop on the "Green
Shift" in the Arctic, part of the 2023 Arctic Frontiers conference. Sat
here amidst the local communities, the fisheries and the stunning
mountain scenery, the two authors of this paper met, alongside 32 young
and emerging leaders from different walks of life and industries across
the Arctic. The combined knowledge of our group covered a wide range of
perspectives and [[personal experiences gained through living in the
Arctic, Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, and knowledge
[[specific to]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}-[[based industry]{.underline}]{.mark}
including fisheries, renewables and many more. In the workshop we found
that our diverse group [[share]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[a common vision
for the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of creating a sustainable
north, [[where voices and decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of the North
are [[from the North]{.underline}]{.mark} and planetary and human
welfare [[are at the forefront]{.underline}]{.mark} of our actions.

CONCLUSION

[[Mining is a major industry in the Arctic with huge potential to
bring]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[a sustainable and just
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps the
potential that these projects can bring to the Arctic and the [[positive
examples]{.underline}]{.mark} that we can learn from [[need to be better
communicated]{.underline}]{.mark} and realised in the context of mining.
[[We are at a critical moment]{.underline}]{.mark} in time
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, to achieve this vision, we [[must
incorporate a diversity of voices, be open to stepping away from
"business as usual" and develop a new practice for
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic. As noted previously, [[there
are many positive examples of co-management
schemes]{.underline}]{.mark}, braided knowledge systems and shared
ownership of projects throughout the Arctic and circumpolar North.
[[Sustainability must reach beyond a solely environmental focus and
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of [[collaborative
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} and benefit sharing. By talking about
this more, we can not only help engage more people in the conversation
but also in the solutions for bringing about a Just Transition. After
all, [[what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}, who [[have lived sustainably

governance]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, their sovereignty and rights
are frequently overlooked in decision-making processes \[270\]. Studies
emphasise the necessity of incorporating Indigenous knowledge into
governance frameworks to achieve culturally suitable and sustainable
adaptation policies \[31,32,42\]. Collaborative governance approaches
that emphasise [[resource co-management have showed potential, notably
in mitigating]{.underline}]{.mark} the effects of [[climate

Approximately 4 million people inhabit the Arctic and the region
occupies an area of \>33 million km2 , [[spanning 8
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (Murray et al., 1998). [[The Arctic is
home to]{.underline}]{.mark} over [[40 different Indigenous
groups]{.underline}]{.mark} including Sámi, Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik
communities who are spread across Northern Europe, North America, Russia
and Greenland (WWF Arctic, 2023). [[Indigenous people make
up]{.underline}]{.mark} around [[10% of the]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Plan violates UNDRIP

Anna K **Bidgood**, 20**24** (Earth and Planets Laboratory, **Carnegie**
Institution for Science) & Jessica Hall (Centre for Sámi Studies, UiT
The Arctic University of Norway) \"We Need to Talk About Mining in the
Arctic.\" Earth Science, Systems and Society 4.1 (2024): 10117.
<https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/pdf/10.3389/esss.2024.10117>
(ermo-MSDI, acc 6-23-2025)

One example of this is The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]{.underline}]{.mark}) which was adopted in
2007 and [[establishes a **universal** framework of minimum standards
for the survival]{.underline}]{.mark}, dignity and wellbeing [[of
Indigenous Peoples worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark} (United Nations,
2015). [[UNDRIP stipulates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Indigenous
Peoples are not solely stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} in potential
extractive projects [[but **instead**]{.underline}]{.mark}, they are
[[right holders]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[ratification of UNDRIP led
to **change** throughout the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
in Greenland, the 30 year old "Greenland [[Home
Rule]{.underline}]{.mark} Arrangement" [[was
replaced]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2009 [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Act
on Greenland [[Self Government]{.underline}]{.mark}. This provided the
legal basis for Greenland gaining authority, previously held by Denmark,
in matters exclusively related to Greenlandic domestic affairs and
natural resources (International Energy Agency, 2023). Furthermore, in
2011, the Government of Sweden [[added]{.underline}]{.mark} a reform
[[to the Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}, stipulating that the
Government shall encourage opportunities for the Sámi people and for
other ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities in Sweden to preserve
and develop their own culture and community life (Human Rights Council
Report, 2014).

[[An integral part of UNDRIP is]{.underline}]{.mark} the notion of
[[Free, Prior and Informed Consent]{.underline}]{.mark} (FPIC) which
stipulates that states must have obtained free, prior and informed
consent [[**before** adopting and implementing]{.underline}]{.mark}
legislative or administrative [[measures which impact Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. The recognition and promotion of the Free
Prior Informed [[Consent is an important principle]{.underline}]{.mark}
of engaging [[with Indigenous peoples during mining]{.underline}]{.mark}
projects and has become very important [[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The International Finance Corporation, a member of [[the World
Bank]{.underline}]{.mark}, has [[created eight performance
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} which aim to provide guidance on how to
avoid, mitigate and manage risks [[so]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[business is]{.underline}]{.mark} conducted in a
[[sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark} way (International Finance
Corporation, 2012a). These standards recognise that Indigenous Peoples
may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts associated with
project development, including the loss of identity, culture, and
natural resource-based livelihoods (International Finance Corporation,
2012b). The implementation of FPIC has also been seen in the mining
industry. In 2013, the International Council on Mining and Metals
([[ICMM]{.underline}]{.mark}) published a position statement on the
rights of Indigenous peoples [[incorporating FPIC
principles]{.underline}]{.mark} and promoting constructive relationships
between mining companies and Indigenous peoples. ICMM [[noted the
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} in acknowledgement and application of FPIC
in the mining industry [[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the Mining, Minerals
and Sustainable Development (MMSD) initiative was completed, [[12 years
ago]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In addition to the protections provided by UNDRIP and FPIC, the
International Labour Organisation Convention formed the Indigenous and
Tribals Peoples Convention in 1989, which is often referred to as [[ILO
No. 169, recognising Indigenous Peoples' right to
self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark} and paving the way for the
creation and implementation of UNDRIP. A previous ILO convention, No.
107 formed in 1957, was created in the wake of WW2 amidst rising concern
regarding the oppression and discrimination of Indigenous Peoples.
[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark} declined to sign this convention in 1958,
noting that the provisions included did not apply to the Sámi (Ravna,
2020) but [[became the first to ratify]{.underline}]{.mark} ILO No. 169
in 1989. As one of the signatory states, Norway is obliged [[to
recognise Sámi self determination]{.underline}]{.mark} and within this
is the restitution of Sámi culture and heritage. An example of this is
the Bååstede project which has seen around 1,600 Sámi cultural heritage
artefacts from the Norwegian Folk Museum and the Museum of Cultural
History in Oslo, being returned to six Sámi museum siidas. Furthermore,
the National Archives of Norway handed over the Lapp Codicil which is an
addendum to the Stromstad Treaty of 1751 which defined the
Norwegian-Swedish border, to the Sámi Archives, located in Kautokeino in
2021. This addendum to the border treaty contains provisions on the
right of reindeer-herding between the Swedish and Norwegian border (The
Library of Congress, 2021).

[[Minerals are]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[important]{.underline}]{.mark}
part of our future, particularly [[in the transition
to]{.underline}]{.mark} an economy driven by [[renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the supply of critical raw materials
may influence our ability [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} produce renewable
energy and [[fulfil]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[climate
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. The rise in demand for critical metals is
driving exploration and mining globally. The historical, and in some
places current, record of [[mining has led to
distrust]{.underline}]{.mark} among many stakeholders, including
Indigenous and other communities [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark},
resulting in the mining industry being the least trusted industrial
sector globally, below oil and gas (Dhawan, 2023; data from GlobeScan).
[[To meet]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[climate goals]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[need]{.underline}]{.mark} to open
more mines to supply the [[critical raw materials]{.underline}]{.mark}
we need, but we have to do this [[in an environmentally and socially
responsible way]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### 10% of arctic residents are indigenous -- consulting them on extraction critical to justice

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} encompasses a myriad of ecosystems,
transcending borders between nations and cultures. It is home to 4
million people, including numerous [[Indigenous groups making up around
10% of the population]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although underexplored, it
is also host to a variety of geologically diverse mineral deposits that
[[are critical]{.underline}]{.mark} to the production of renewable
energy and our ability to achieve our climate goals. However, the impact
of climate change on the Arctic is magnified and some of our solutions
to climate change have the potential to have negative local impacts.
Furthermore, the history of mining in the Arctic raises understandable
concerns as to whether or not we should be exploring and mining in the
Arctic. This article discusses the interplay between the environment,
people and development in the Arctic, with a specific focus on the
history of exploration and mining in the region. We pose [[questions
such as]{.underline}]{.mark}: "How do we [[balance]{.underline}]{.mark}
the global need for minerals with [[environmental and social concerns
around resource extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}?", and "can we envisage
a future for mining in the Arctic which ensures long-term
sustainability, environmental stewardship and Indigenous wellbeing and
collaboration?" [[The answer]{.underline}]{.mark} to some of these
questions [[might lie in]{.underline}]{.mark} examples of more
successful resource development in the Arctic, which include
[[Indigenous benefit agreements, braided knowledge systems and shared
ownership projects]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is clear that [[only by
incorporating a diversity of voices and partnerships, and challenging
business as usual in the Arctic, can we]{.underline}]{.mark} begin to
[[conceive]{.underline}]{.mark} of potential solutions for achieving [[a
just transition]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While these changes have potential economic advantages, they also
represent major risks to the environment. Increased industrial activity
can cause pollution, habitat degradation, and social impacts, which
disproportionately affect Indigenous communities that rely on Arctic
ecosystem stability and resources \[214,215\]. The possibility of
[[transboundary conflicts over resource claims emphasises the need for
strong governance frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} that balance economic
development, environmental conservation, and community rights \[205\].
Despite these constraints, [[Arctic communities have demonstrated
extraordinary resilience through adaptive techniques and policy
initiatives. Indigenous knowledge systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
emphasise sustainable resource use and community-based monitoring, are
crucial in [[respond]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark} \[203,216\]. [[Co-management of wildlife
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, and the development of
renewable energy initiatives m[[inimise reliance on foreign supply while
also mitigating environmental harm]{.underline}]{.mark} \[217\]. At the
[[policy level, efforts, like the Arctic Council and national adaptation
programs, aim to boost resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} by encouraging
collaboration among local, national, and international stakeholders
\[212\]. These efforts underscore the need of combining scientific
research with Indigenous knowledge to provide equitable and effective

### 1NC \-- AT: Amplification

#### Amplification poorly understood -- may be overstated -- no solvency

[[Arctic amplification]{.underline}]{.mark} is a process in which the
Arctic region warms at a much higher rate than the global average, as
supported by instrumental evidence, climate models, and paleoclimate
proxy records \[135,136\]. Several connected mechanisms contribute to
this rapid warming, including marine heating and the ice--albedo
feedback mechanism (Figure 3), which exposes darker ocean surfaces when
sea ice melts, resulting in higher solar energy absorption \[4\].
Atmospheric feedback mechanisms, such as Planck feedback, lapse-rate
feedback, and cloud feedback, as well as ocean heat transport and
meridional atmospheric moisture transport, also play important roles
\[137,138\]. Recent decreases in air pollution in Europe \[139\] have
been related to increasing Arctic warming, and future reductions in
Asian aerosols owing to mitigation policies may exacerbate this trend
\[140\]. [[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the well-known [[trends, there
is little agreement on the exact magnitude]{.underline}]{.mark} of AA,
with studies reporting Arctic warming at nearly twice, thrice, and four
times the global average. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme
reports a rate of warming three times faster than global warming from
1971 to 2019 \[141\]. The [[differences stem from different definitions
of AA]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the time periods and geographical
limits examined. While [[climate models]{.underline}]{.mark}, notably
those in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), have
made progress in modelling Arctic climate evolution and sea ice
dynamics, many continue to [[struggle to
appropriately]{.underline}]{.mark} depict the
[[sensitivity]{.underline}]{.mark} of sea ice loss to global temperature
increases. Understanding whether climate models can effectively
reproduce the reported scale of AA is important, given that sea ice loss
is an important cause of the phenomena. Although previous research
suggests that AA is weaker in climate models than in observations
\[142\], [[a complete comparison with]{.underline}]{.mark} the most
[[recent]{.underline}]{.mark} observational [[datasets has yet to be
undertaken]{.underline}]{.mark}. Arctic amplification is an important
climate phenomenon with far-reaching implications for global climate
systems, [[emphasising the need for further research and better climate
models to support effective policy]{.underline}]{.mark} decisions
targeted at minimising climate change impacts.

AA is a well-known phenomenon characterised by increased warming in the
Arctic relative to the global average, primarily caused by such
processes as sea ice--albedo feedback, which reduces the surface albedo
as ice melts, exposing more ocean that absorbs heat \[143,144\]. Recent
research has highlighted the subtle functions of cloud and water vapour
feedback mechanisms, with increased cloud cover blocking incoming solar
radiation while increasing downward longwave radiation, resulting in net
warming \[145\]. Temperature feedback, influenced by stable
stratification of the Arctic atmosphere, leads to positive feedback via
a lower lapse rate, resulting in higher warmth aloft \[146\]. The
movement of heat and water vapour from lower latitudes to the Arctic
exacerbates regional warming \[10,147\]. [[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}
a thorough [[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [[mechanisms,
quantifying their relative contributions is difficult,
implying]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Arctic amplification persists even
when]{.underline}]{.mark} specific feedback mechanisms are
[[suppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}, resulting in dynamic competition
among feedback processes in climate models \[142\].

trend [lies in the]{.mark} lower half of]{.underline}** the collection
of **[climate model simulations, and for several periods it lies very
close]{.underline}** (or even below) **[the [2.5th percentile]{.mark} of
all the model runs]{.underline}**. Over shorter periods, such as the
last two decades, a plethora of mechanisms have been put forth to
explain the observed/modeled divergence, but none do so completely and
many of the explanations are inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that **[almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline}** incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- **[[overstate]{.mark} past
and current temperature [trends by a factor of]{.mark} two to
[three]{.mark}, and at times even more]{.underline}**. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, **[every]{.underline}** CMIP **[climate
model predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gas should create an enhanced heating effect
in]{.underline}** the mid-troposphere **[over the
tropics]{.underline}** --- that is, at an altitude over the tropics of
about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying climatology is simple: Most of
the tropics is ocean, and as increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations
warm the Earth slightly, there should be an increase in the evaporation
of ocean water in this region. When the water vapor rises into the
mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing heat. And **[yet]{.underline}**
the **[satellites cannot find this heating effect --- a reality
suggesting that our understanding of climate and atmospheric phenomena
is not as robust as many seem to assume]{.underline}**.

**[The [poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark} of mainstream climate
models [is exacerbated by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC and
U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} highly [unrealistic]{.mark}
future [increases]{.mark} in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}**. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. **[The [average]{.mark}]{.underline}** annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** under RCP8.5 **[[is]{.mark} over
[five times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline}** for
2000-2019 **[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}**. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the
Georgia Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as

[Weeks before thermobaric rockets rained down on Ukraine, the chattering
classes at the World Economic Forum
[declared](https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-report-2022)
"climate action failure" the **biggest global risk for the coming
decade**]{.underline}. On the eve of war, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry
[fretted](https://youtu.be/vksGzhgYnEw?t=298) about the "massive
emissions consequences" of Russian invasion and worried that the world
might forget about the risks of climate change if fighting broke out.
[Amid the conflict and the many other challenges facing the globe right
now, like inflation and food price hikes, the [global elite has an
**unhealthy obsession with climate change**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This
[fixation has had]{.mark} **three [important consequences]{.mark}**.
[First]{.mark}, it has [distracted]{.mark} the Western [world from
**real geopolitical threats**]{.mark}. [Russia]{.mark}'s invasion
[should be a **wake-up call** that **war is**]{.mark} **still [a serious
danger]{.mark}** that requires democratic nations'
attention]{.underline}. But a month into the war in Ukraine, United
Nations Secretary-General António Guterres---whose organization's main
purpose is ensuring world peace---was [focused
instead](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1505914097262637058)
on "climate catastrophe," warning that fossil-fuel addiction will bring
"mutually assured destruction." His comments come at a time when nuclear
weapons are posing the biggest risk of literal mutually assured
destruction in half a century. Second, [the narrow focus on immediate
climate objectives **undermines future prosperity**.]{.underline} The
world currently [shells out more than half a trillion
dollars](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/)
annually in private and public funds on climate policies, while spending
from the governments of countries in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on innovation that underpins growth in areas
such as healthcare, space, defense, agriculture and science has been
declining as a percentage of gross domestic product over recent decades.
Education performance in developed nations is stagnant or declining, and
real income growth among OECD countries has almost stalled this century.
By contrast, in China, where innovation-related spending is up 50% from
where it was in 2000 and education is rapidly improving, average incomes
have increased fivefold since the start of the 21st century. Third, in
the world's poorest countries, the international community's focus on
putting up solar panels coexists with a woeful underinvestment in
solutions to massive existing problems. Infectious diseases like
tuberculosis and malaria kill millions; malnutrition afflicts almost a
billion people; more than three billion lack access to reliable energy.
[These and other issues plaguing the developing world are solvable, but
get far less funding from wealthy countries than climate
change]{.underline}. Giving the developing world affordable access to
consistently available energy---which often requires fossil fuels---is
the key to lifting most of the world out of poverty. Yet before the
invasion of Ukraine, the developed world was racing to make fossil fuel
energy more expensive and less accessible for the world's poorest. [What
underpins this climate fixation? [The **false and irresponsible
idea**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark} [poses an immediate
existential risk]{.mark} for the world. Climate change is real and
man-made; have no doubt about that. But the [best]{.mark} economic
[estimates]{.mark} used by the Obama and Biden administrations, as well
as those created by the only climate economist to ever win the Nobel
Prize in economics, all [show]{.mark} that the [total impact]{.mark} [of
unmitigated]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark}---not just on the economy
but overall---would be equivalent to **[less than a 4% hit]{.mark} to
global GDP** annually by the end of the century.]{.underline} The [[U.N.
estimates]{.mark} that the average person in 2100 will be 450% as rich
as today. If climate change continues unabated, the average person will
be "only" 434% as rich---a **[far from]{.mark} [catastrophic
outcome]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A world scared witless doesn't make
smart decisions---so it should be no surprise it hasn't managed to make
a dent in climate change. Globally, last year saw the most CO2 emissions
ever, despite \$5 trillion spent over the past decade on climate
policies. The U.N. [admitted in
2019](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30022/EGR10.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
that there has been "no real change in the global emissions pathway in
the last decade" despite the global Paris agreement. The European Union
has tried to shift to renewables but still gets more than 70% of its
energy from fossil fuels. Much of the rest is generated by burning wood
chips from trees chopped down in America and transported on diesel
ships. Solar and wind produce only 3% of the European Union's energy,
and the technology is unreliable, often requiring backup from gas when
the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. Europe's refusal to
embrace shale gas---which can be found throughout the Continent but
remains untapped---has left it at the mercy of Russian gas. The past two
months show how dangerous this is. Well-meaning politicians across the
world have been proposing policies to reach net-zero emissions in coming
decades. According to McKinsey, the policies will cost \$9.2 trillion
every year until net zero is supposed to be achieved in 2050. This is
equivalent to half the global tax take. Such extremely costly policies
are unlikely to be enacted by emerging economies such as India or
Africa, whose emissions will skyrocket as their populations and
economies grow. Net zero is also likely to fail in the developed world,
where its high costs will erode prosperity and thus political support.
Achieving net zero would cost every American family \$19,300 a year,
according to the McKinsey study. [To respond to climate change
effectively, [the world needs]{.mark} to **spend [more]{.mark} on
[green-energy innovation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **develop
[renewables]{.mark}** that are reliable and cost-effective]{.underline}.
To address their immediate energy problems, Europe and America need to
embrace fracking---despite [Russian-funded
propaganda](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-2019/the-plot-against-fracking/)
discrediting it---and help the rest of the world access the oil and gas
it needs. [There are many serious threats in the world today, but most
won't get the attention they deserve until the political classes
**[drop]{.mark} their [hyperbole about]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark}**
and treat it like what it actually is---only one of the many problems to
be solved in the 21st century.]{.underline}

#### Warming won't cause global conflict

**Cook 20** -- Dr. Ian, Senior Lecturer in Global Politics and Policy at
Murdoch University, PhD in Political Theory from the University of
Queensland. "The Politics of the Final Hundred Years of Humanity
(2030-2130)", Springer Singapore, xx-xx-2020

Yet **[a]{.underline}**nother [problem with the assumption that
catastrophic human-caused environment change simply causes civil
war]{.underline}, as Salehyan and Hendrix noted, [is that violence at
the scale of a civil war requires significant resources. In their view,
civil wars are more likely to occur in times of **relative abundance**.
[While "**riots**]{.mark} and **protests**, [may
emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} from conditions of scarcity," they argue,
"[**[sustaining]{.mark}** a militant organization [requires]{.mark}
considerable planning and [resources]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Salehyan and
Hendrix 2014, p. 240). [Reasons to fight might exist. For this [to turn
into]{.mark} civil [war]{.mark}, however, [people]{.mark} "also
[need]{.mark} the **[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to do so,
[[and]{.mark} environmental [scarcity]{.mark} may **limit such
capability**, thus **[undermin]{.mark}ing [the resource base
necessary]{.mark}** for mobilizing armed violence"]{.underline}
(Salehyan and Hendrix 2014, p. 240).

A related debate concerns what Adams and colleagues have claimed to be
[a **sampling bias** in studies of the connection between environment
change and armed conflict]{.underline} (Adams et al. 2018). Levy accepts
the existence of some sampling bias but rejects the view that this bias
results in an overstatement of the connection between environment change
and conflict. "Knowing that case selection is biased is useful, but not
a reason to lower our estimate of the climate's impact on conflict"
(Levy 2018, p. 441).

In responding to Levy's criticism, authors claiming bias wrote that they
did not "deny a link between climate change and conflict in principal.
Indeed, some of our own recent work indicates that such [a [link]{.mark}
exists, but it [is **highly conditional**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Their
problem with the research being done in this field was that "[[sampling
biases]{.mark}... increase the risk that such links are
**[overstate]{.mark}**d]{.underline}, that [crucial world regions do not
receive sufficient attention]{.underline} and that little knowledge is
produced on peaceful adaptation" (Ide et al. 2018, p. 442-- 3).

After reviewing the literature on the relationship between climate
change and violent conflict, Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld concluded
that the "[current **[lit]{.mark}**erature [offers **mixed
ev**]{.mark}idence]{.underline}. This makes it difficult to render a
definitive statement about the climate-conflict relationship" (2017, p.
640). While they pointed out that just over 60% of the studies they
reviewed found "that climate change variables are positively correlated
with higher levels of violent conflict," Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld
also argued that "[many **subtleties** and [**countertrends**
underlie]{.mark} this overall pattern]{.underline}" (2017, p. 640).
Thus, even though "a majority of reviewed studies envision climate
variables influencing conflict through a causal pathway, ... these
[[pathways]{.mark} are]{.underline} often [**theoretically
underspecified** and [have **only weak**]{.mark} **empirical
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Sakaguchi et al. 2017, p. 641).

As Koubi put it, the research that has been done on this question
"provides some evidence that climatic changes could act as a 'threat
multiplier' in several of the world's regions. In particular, the extant
literature shows that climatic conditions can lead to conflict in
agricultural-dependent regions and in combination and interaction with
other socioeconomic and political factors" (Koubi 2018, p. 200). After
having claimed that, to their knowledge, "[**[no one]{.mark}** in the
field of climate research has [suggested]{.mark} that [climate]{.mark}
change [could be the **'sole cause' of war**]{.mark}, violence, unrest
or migration]{.underline}", Butler and Kefford recommended "viewing
climate change instead as a risk multiplier, influencer or co-factor ...
In this way of thinking, environmental and ecological factors interact
with social determinants, including those that are economic, demographic
and political, to produce phenomena such as migration, conflict and
famine" (2018, p. 587).

There can be no doubt that conflict will increase during the final
hundred years of humanity. But it will result from a complex interaction
of socio-political factors and a catastrophically changed environment.
It may not go beyond conflict between different groups or between the
government and opposition groups and become civil war. This depends on
the capacity of those opposition groups. In many cases, they will lack
the resources to conduct a civil war. The Syrian war is itself a good
illustration of the problem, as the groups opposed to the Syrian
government have only been able to conduct the extended civil war in
which they have been engaged with the support of outside groups.
(Mazzetti and Apuzzo 2016).

The question of whether civil war will break out is something that can
only be answered "region by region" and the answer must be based on
"knowledge of pre-conflict geographies, such as drivers of resilience
and vulnerability" (Farbotko 2018). Sometimes governments may abandon
territory and opposition groups can seize control of that land. But it
is likely to be land that is suffering worst from the effects of
catastrophic human-caused environment change and will not be habitable.
To replace an existing government or take control of a region within a
country through [civil [war]{.mark}]{.underline} is no simple thing. It
may happen. But it will not happen on the scale that some people have
predicted. And it [[will **not happen**]{.mark} just [because of]{.mark}
the [weather]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No climate wars OR extinction

**Shellenberger 20** -- Michael, Founder and President of Environmental
Progress and Co-Founder of the Breakthrough Institute. "Why I Believe
Climate Change Is Not the End of the World", Quillette,
<https://quillette.com/2020/07/08/why-i-believe-climate-change-is-not-the-end-of-the-world>,

What the IPCC had actually written in its 2018 report and press release
was that in order to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5
degrees Celsius from preindustrial times, carbon emissions needed to
decline 45 percent by 2030. [The [IPCC did **not** say]{.mark} the
**world would end**, nor that **[civilization would collapse]{.mark}**,
if temperatures rose above 1.5 degrees Celsius]{.underline}.

Scientists had a similarly negative reaction to the extreme claims made
by Extinction Rebellion. Stanford University atmospheric scientist Ken
Caldeira, one of the first scientists to raise the alarm about ocean
acidification, stressed that "[while many species are threatened with
extinction, **[climate]{.mark} change [does not threaten]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}." MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel
told me, "I don't have much patience for the apocalypse criers. I don't
think it's helpful to describe it as an apocalypse."

An AOC spokesperson told Axios, "We can quibble about the phraseology,
whether it's existential or cataclysmic." But, he added, "We're seeing
lots of \[climate change--related\] problems that are already impacting
lives."

But if that's the case, [the impact is **dwarfed** by the **92 percent
decline** in the decadal death toll from natural disasters since its
peak in the 1920s]{.underline}. In that decade, 5.4 million people died
from natural disasters. In the 2010s, just 0.4 million did. Moreover,
that decline occurred during a period when the global population nearly
quadrupled.

In fact, both rich and poor societies have become far less vulnerable to
extreme weather events in recent decades. In 2019, the journal Global
En­vironmental Change published a major study that found death rates and
economic damage dropped by 80 to 90 percent during the last four
decades, from the 1980s to the present.

While global sea levels rose 7.5 inches (0.19 meters) between 1901 and
2010, the IPCC estimates sea levels will rise as much as 2.2 feet (0.66
meters) by 2100 in its medium scenario, and by 2.7 feet (0.83 meters) in
its high-end scenario. [**[Even if]{.mark}** these predictions prove to
be **[significant underestimates]{.mark}**, the [**slow pace** of
sea]{.mark} level [rise]{.mark} will likely [allow]{.mark} societies
[**ample time** for **adaptation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[We have **good examples** of **successful adaptation** to sea level
rise. The **Netherlands**]{.underline}, for instance,
[became]{.underline} a [wealthy]{.underline} nation [despite having
one-third of its landmass below sea level]{.underline}, including areas
a full seven meters below sea level, as a result of the gradual sinking
of its landscapes.

And [today, our [capability for **modifying environments** is]{.mark}
**far [great]{.mark}er than** ever before]{.underline}. Dutch experts
today are already working with the government of Bangladesh to prepare
for rising sea levels.

What about fires? Dr. Jon Keeley, a US Geological Survey scientist in
California who has researched the topic for 40 years, told me, "We've
looked at the history of climate and fire throughout the whole state,
and through much of the state, particularly the western half of the
state, we don't see any relationship between past climates and the
amount of area burned in any given year."

In 2017, Keeley and a team of scientists modeled 37 different regions
across the United States and found that "humans may not only influence
fire regimes but their presence can actually override, or swamp out, the
effects of climate." Keeley's team found that the only statistically
significant factors for the frequency and severity of fires on an annual
basis were population and proximity to development.

As for the Amazon, the New York Times reported, correctly, that "\[the
2019\] fires were not caused by climate change."

[In]{.underline} early [2020, [scientists challenged the notion]{.mark}
that [rising carbon]{.mark} dioxide levels in the ocean [were
making]{.mark} coral reef [fish]{.mark} species [oblivious]{.mark} to
predators]{.underline}. The seven scientists who published their study
in the journal Nature had, three years earlier, raised questions about
the marine biologist who had made such claims in the journal Science in
2016. After an investigation, James Cook University in Australia
concluded that [the biologist had **fabricated her data**]{.underline}.

[When it comes to food production]{.underline}, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations [(FAO) concludes]{.underline} that
crop [[**yields** will **increase**]{.mark}
**significantly**]{.underline}, under a wide range of climate change
scenarios. Humans today produce enough food for ten billion people, a 25
percent surplus, and experts believe we will produce even more despite
climate change.

Food production, the FAO finds, will depend more on access to tractors,
irrigation, and fertilizer than on climate change, just as it did in the
last century. The FAO projects that even farmers in the poorest regions
today, like sub-Saharan Africa, may see 40 percent crop yield increases
from technological improvements alone.

In its fourth assessment report, the IPCC projected that by 2100, the
global economy would be three to six times larger than it is today, and
that the costs of adapting to a high (4 degrees Celsius) temperature
rise would reduce gross domestic product (GDP) just 4.5 percent.

[Does any of that really sound like the end of the world?]{.underline}

The apocalypse now

Anyone interested in seeing the end of the world up close and in person
could do little worse than to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in central Africa. The Congo has a way of putting first-world prophecies
of climate apocalypse into perspective. I traveled there in December
2014 to study the impact of widespread wood fuel use on people and
wildlife, particularly on the fabled mountain gorillas.

Within minutes of crossing from the neighboring country of Rwanda into
the Congolese city of Goma, I was taken aback by the extreme poverty and
chaos: children as young as two years old perched on the handlebars of
motorcycles flying past us on roads pockmarked with giant potholes;
tin-roofed shanties as homes; people crammed like prisoners into tiny
buses with bars over the windows; trash everywhere; giant mounds of
cooled lava on the sides of the road, reminders of the volcanic anger
just beneath the Earth's surface.

In the 1990s and again in the early 2000s, Congo was the epicenter of
the Great African War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, which
involved nine African countries and resulted in the deaths of three to
five million people, mostly because of disease and starvation. Another
two million people were displaced from their homes or sought asylum in
neighboring countries. Hundreds of thousands of people, women, and men,
adults, and children, were raped, sometimes more than once, by different
armed groups.

During our time in the Congo, armed militias roaming the countryside had
been killing villagers, including children, with machetes. Some blamed
Al-Shabaab terrorists coming in from Uganda, but nobody took credit for
the attacks. The violence appeared unconnected to any military or
strategic objective. The national military, police, and United Nations
Peacekeeping Forces, about 6,000 soldiers, were either unable or
unwilling to do anything about the terrorist attacks.

"Do not travel," the United States Department of State said, bluntly, of
the Congo on its website. "Violent crime, such as armed robbery, armed
home invasion, and assault, while rare compared to petty crime, is not
uncommon, and local police lack the resources to respond effectively to
serious crime. Assailants may pose as police or security agents."

One reason I felt safe traveling to the eastern Congo and bringing my
wife, Helen, was that the actor Ben Affleck had visited several times
and even started a charity there to support economic development. If the
eastern Congo was safe enough for a Hollywood celebrity, I reasoned, it
would be safe enough for Helen and me.

To make sure, I hired Affleck's guide, translator, and "fixer," Caleb
Kabanda, a Congolese man with a reputation for keeping his clients safe.
We spoke on the telephone before I arrived. I told Caleb I wanted to
study the relationship between energy scarcity and conservation.
Referring to the North Kivu province capital of Goma, the sixth most
populated city in the Congo, Caleb asked, "Can you imagine a city of
nearly two million people relying on wood for energy? It's crazy!"

Ninety-eight percent of people in eastern Congo rely on wood and
charcoal as their primary energy for cooking. In the Congo as a whole,
nine out of 10 of its nearly 92 million people do, while just one out of
five has any access to electricity. The entire country relies on just
1,500 megawatts of electricity, which is about as much as a city of one
million requires in developed nations.

The main road Caleb and I used to travel from Goma to the communities
around Virunga Park had recently been paved, but there was little else
in the way of infrastructure. Most roads were dirt roads. When it
rained, both the paved and unpaved roads and the surrounding homes were
flooded because there was no flood control system. I was reminded of how
much we take for granted in developed nations. We practically forget
that the gutters, canals, and culverts, which capture and divert water
away from our homes, even exist.

Is climate change playing a role in Congo's ongoing instability? If it
is, it's outweighed by other factors. Climate change, noted a large team
of researchers in 2019, "has affected organized armed conflict within
countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development
and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more
influential."

There is only a barely functioning government in the Congo. When it
comes to security and development, people are mostly on their own.
Depending on the season, farmers suffer too much rain or not enough.
Recently, there has been flooding once every two or three years. Floods
regularly destroy homes and farms.

Researchers with the Peace Research Institute Oslo note, "Demographic
and environmental variables have a very moderate effect on the risk of
civil conflict." The IPCC agrees. "[[There is]{.mark} robust evidence of
[disasters]{.mark} displacing people worldwide, [but limited
**ev**]{.mark}idence that [climate]{.mark} change or sea-level rise [is
the]{.mark} direct [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Lack of infrastructure plus scarcity of clean water brings disease. As a
result, Congo suffers some of the highest rates of cholera, malaria,
yellow fever, and other preventable diseases in the world.

"[Lower levels of GDP are the **most important predictor** of armed
conflict]{.underline}," write the Oslo researchers, who add, "[Our
results show that resource scarcity affects the risk of conflict less in
low-income states than in wealthier states]{.underline}."

[If resources determined a nation's fate, then resource-scarce Japan
would be poor and at war while the Congo would be rich and at
peace]{.underline}. Congo is astonishingly rich when it comes to its
lands, minerals, forests, oil, and gas.

There are many reasons why the Congo is so dysfunctional. It is
massive---it is the second largest African nation in area, behind only
Algeria---and difficult to govern as a single country. It was colonized
by the Belgians, who fled the country in the early 1960s without
establishing strong government institutions, like an independent
judiciary and a military.

Is it overpopulated? The population of Eastern Congo has doubled since
the 1950s and 1960s. But the main factor is technological: the same area
could produce much more food and support many more people if there were
roads, fertilizers, and tractors.

The Congo is a victim of geography, colonialism, and terrible
post-colonial governments. Its economy grew from \$7.4 billion in 2001
to \$38 billion in 2017, but the annual per capita income of \$561 is
one of the lowest in the world, leading many to conclude that much of
the money that should flow to the people is being stolen.

For the last 20 years, the Rwandan government has been taking minerals
from its neighbor and exporting them as its own. To protect and obscure
its activities, Rwanda has financed and overseen the low-intensity
conflict in Eastern Congo, according to experts.

There were free elections in 2006 and optimism around the new president,
Joseph Kabila, but he proved as corrupt as past leaders. After being
re-elected in 2011, he stayed in power until 2018, when he installed a
candidate who won just 19 percent of the vote as compared to the
opposition candidate, who won 59 percent. As such, Kabila and his allies

[WHAT]{.underline} IS THE [**EVIDENCE** OF]{.underline} CURRENT [DAMAGE
DUE TO CO2 OR **GLOBAL WARMING**?]{.underline}

Currently [it is [very hard to **find**]{.mark} any unusual **weather**
or **[weather-related disaster]{.mark}** that can be [blamed on
**climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether natural or
human-caused, [despite constant news media claims to the
contrary]{.underline}. AR6 can only point to an increase in heat
waves.28 [Weather-related **disasters** occur every year. But the trends
in the cost, as a fraction of **GDP**, or **human suffering** and death
due to them are, respectively, flat or rapidly declining]{.underline} as
explained by Roger Pielke Jr.29 and Bjorn Lomborg.30

Globally, [[most damage]{.underline}]{.mark} (around 90%) [from extreme
weather by far is [due to **flooding** and]{.mark} severe
**[storms]{.mark}**, such as **tropical cyclones**.]{.underline}31 The
most [damaging extremes, **hurricanes**, floods, and (weather-related)
droughts [have not **changed** globally]{.mark} on **climatic time
scales** (\>30 years).]{.underline}32 The [[earth has **warmed**]{.mark}
by [slightly]{.mark} more than one **degree** Celsius, [and]{.mark} the
[CO2 **concentration** has gone up]{.mark}, but the most dramatic,
**destructive**, and [deadly **extreme weather events** have not
changed]{.mark} significantly or have **declined**]{.underline}.33
[Further, 52 of 53 **studies** of disaster losses due to **extreme
weather** were unable to **attribute** the events [to human
causes]{.mark}, and the one **study**]{.underline} 34 [that did claim
**human attribution** was **flawed**]{.underline}.35

While there are [places]{.underline} in AR6 where they [claim the
frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased and]{.underline}
they try ([using models and weather pattern analysis) to
show]{.underline} these are [related to human **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as
emissions]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} do [acknowledge that there is
"low **confidence** in the human **influence** on the changes in **high
river flows** on the global scale ... \[and\] there is low
**confidence** in attributing **changes** in the probability or
**magnitude** of flood events to human **influence** ...]{.underline}"36

In the same section of AR6, they write: "... [it remains **uncertain**
whether past changes in Atlantic \[tropical cyclone\] **activity** are
outside the range of natural variability."37 A plot of US
**landfalling** major **hurricanes** is shown]{.underline} in Figure 3.

\[Figure omitted\]

As Figure 3 shows, the number of [major U.S. [**hurricanes** is
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}. The total number of hurricanes striking
the U.S. is also declining.38 In fact, [the global [weather
losses]{.mark}, due to all **extreme weather**, [are declining]{.mark}
as a **percentage** of global **GDP**]{.underline}.39

Bjorn Lomborg has shown that [[**climate** and **weather-related**
deaths have declined]{.mark} an astonishing 99% since
1920]{.underline}.40 This is very significant [since non-climate and
non-weather related deaths due to other natural disasters (earthquakes,
tsunamis, volcanos, etc.) have only seen a modest decline over the same
period]{.underline}.41 In other words, [even though the world
**population** has risen more than four times since 1920, there are many
fewer extreme weather deaths today than then]{.underline}. This suggests
(perhaps proves?) that [[humanity has]{.mark} **[adapted]{.mark}** well
to **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}s [since 1920.]{.underline}

#### \--We're past tipping points.

**McGuire 22'** -- Bill, Professor Emeritus of Geophysical and Climate
Hazards at University College London, a co-director of the New Weather
Institute and was a contributor to the 2012 IPCC report on climate
change and extreme events. "Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant's Guide", Icon
Books, 07-28-2022

One thing that keeps climate researchers awake at night is the idea that
[[we]{.mark} have [passed]{.mark}]{.underline} one or more **[[points of
no return]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or 'tipping points' as they are known
in the trade. [Bringing temperatures down]{.underline} on an overheating
planet [is]{.underline} a bit **[[like]{.mark} [trying to turn the
Titanic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and there may well be situations where
-- **[[whatever we do]{.mark} in terms of slashing
emissions]{.underline}** -- [[we]{.mark} [can no longer avoid the
iceberg]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

A good, and especially apposite, example is [the Greenland Ice
Sheet]{.underline}, the wholesale [melting of which threatens a major
hike in global sea leve]{.underline}l. At **[more than a quarter of a
trillion tonnes a year]{.underline}**, [the current rate of ice loss is
already astonishing]{.underline}. But there could be worse news. Some
[researchers think]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} may already have
[passed]{.underline}, or be close to passing, **[[the ice
sheet's]{.mark} tipping point]{.underline}**. This would mean that,
[even if temperatures stopped rising today]{.underline}, **[[melting
would continue]{.mark} to accelerate]{.underline}** until Greenland was
ice-free [and [sea levels around 7 metres higher]{.mark} as a
result]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} would not necessarily happen
rapidly, but it **[[would be]{.mark} baked-in, and so ultimately
[inevitable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Then there are so-called positive feedbacks loops. These involve
responses to [rising temperatures]{.underline} that [act to heat up the
planet even more]{.underline}. For example, as temperatures have climbed
at high latitudes, so the [vast areas of permafrost]{.underline} in
Arctic Canada and Siberia have [started to thaw]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn **[[is releasing methane]{.mark}
trapped below]{.underline}**, [which acts]{.underline} -- in a
self-sustaining loop -- [to reinforce warmin]{.underline}g.

Another example is the progressive disappearance of Arctic sea ice. As
our planet continues to heat up, so [the area covered by sea ice reduces
and is replaced by open ocean]{.underline}. **[Because [dark water
absorbs]{.mark} more [heat]{.mark}]{.underline}** than white ice, [the
more ice is lost, the more temperatures at high latitudes
increase]{.underline}, **[[leading to]{.mark} even [more
melting]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Nevertheless, [the most [impactful **black carbon emissions** occur in
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and high latitudes. [Black carbon
emissions [from]{.mark} **fossil fuel exploitation** and **[exploration
in and near the Arctic]{.mark}** are growing.]{.underline} One study
estimated that gas flaring accounts for 42% of the black carbon emitted
in the Arctic annually.

There are several ways to address this problem, such as capturing rather
than flaring the gas. Still, [in a world where fossil fuel use needs to
be phased out rapidly, [continuing these **activities near the Arctic**
provides a double whammy to the **Arctic** and **global climate
system**]{.mark}, from greenhouse gas and **black carbon
emissions**.]{.underline}

[With at least one sea ice-free summer in the Arctic projected by 2050,
further increases in black carbon emissions from expanding **Arctic

2023, there was a 37% increase in unique ships entering Arctic waters.
[The Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme has

Tipping Points

For centuries, imaginaries of the Arctic have rested on its pristine
whiteness. But [in the Anthropocene, human activities are sullying the
fantastical snow globe. Circulating in the atmosphere are
**light-absorbing particles (LAPs)** like **[black carbon]{.mark}**,
mineral dust, and volcanic ash, all of which can [cast a **pall** on the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 1815, the cataclysmic eruption of Tambora, an Indonesian volcano,
shot 150 cubic kilometers of ash, pumice, and other rocky debris into
the stratosphere. The eruption blocked solar radiation, spurred a
volcanic winter, and decreased the global temperature by 3°C. But the
Arctic warmed as less rain fell on North America, reducing the amount of
cold fresh water in the Atlantic that normally flowed north. Whalers'
reports of suddenly open, ice-free channels spurred the British
Admiralty to recommence its search for the Northwest Passage. Yet this
brief period of Arctic warming was short-lived; the channels refroze by
1818.

Two centuries later, [more of the Arctic is transforming into **open
water**---and this time, humans are to blame. The incomplete
**combustion** of **fossil fuels**, biofuel, and biomass is depositing
black carbon, or **soot**, across the Arctic. These fine [particulates
**absorb sunlight** and **release heat**]{.mark} into the atmosphere,
making them a **major contributor** to climate change. Black carbon is
especially pernicious in the Arctic: it significantly **lowers** the
**albedo**, or the proportion of reflected light, of the snow on which
it falls. [As ice and snow]{.mark} shrink and [melt, creating even
**more dark surfaces**, the **positive feedback loop accelerates
regional warming**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**Where** black carbon is released also **matters**. Particulates
emitted from wood-burning stoves in places like South Asia can affect
the Arctic, but those **emitted locally** have a **larger
impact**.]{.underline}

This is why the actions of Russia, whose northern regions account for
two-thirds of Arctic economic activity despite accounting for only half
of the region's landmass, can alter the fate of the entire circumpolar
North. The country's efforts to reduce gas flaring and emissions from
transportation in recent years have been shown to reduce radiative
forcing, or the amount of energy entering the atmosphere. At the same
time, Russia will continue to burn heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic
until 2029---the last possible moment under International Maritime
Organization (IMO) regulations. The IMO recently voted to ban HFO in the
Arctic to reduce black carbon levels, with voluntary restrictions
beginning in 2024 and mandatory ones in 2029. The five-year "grace
period" was included partly as a concession to Russia, which had opposed
the restrictions altogether. (Canada, too, does not plan to immediately
implement the HFO ban in 2024.)

Another LAP of note is algae. [As warmer spring and summer temperatures
hasten **melting** on the Arctic's snow and ice surfaces, **algae** that
lay dormant in the ice during winter venture up to the surface, where
they **bloom** in grimy green, pink, and gray. Exposure to sunlight
**darkens** the algae, which [**accelerates melting** of the ice
beneath]{.mark}.]{.underline} Climate change is also increasing wind
speeds, leading to greater transport of phosphorus, a naturally
occurring ingredient used in fertilizer. This trend is feeding the
annual algal blooms as well. One portion of the Greenland ice sheet has
become so covered in algae that scientists refer to it as "the dark
zone," a phenomenon that has increased in size and duration over the
past two decades.

As temperatures rise globally, [[the most dramatic change to the Arctic
is its **shrinking ice cap**]{.mark}.]{.underline} When Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech on October 1, 1987, in the Arctic city
of Murmansk, urging that the Arctic should be designated a "zone of
peace," the minimum extent of sea ice was a relatively robust 6.25
million square kilometers. It was hoped that the eight Arctic states
could cooperate to tackle environmental pollutants, which were the chief
fear at the time, as opposed to climate change. Yet by 2023, the frozen
surface totaled only 4.23 million square kilometers---just two-thirds of
its extent when Gorbachev called on the Arctic's nation-states to come
together.

[With the amount of **open water** increasing each year, the world can
no longer overlook the Arctic Ocean's darkening.]{.underline} The pace
of climate change is occurring at a rate that is rendering it difficult
for the region's many ice-reliant cultures and ecosystems to adapt. [By
the end of this century, it is estimated that [the Arctic's open-water
periods will have lengthened by **two months**]{.mark}---including in
the **central Arctic Ocean**, which was still covered in permanent ice
at the end of the twentieth century.]{.underline}

In roughly the same time span since Gorbachev's speech, [[the Arctic has
warmed]{.mark} nearly [**four times faster** than the rest of the world.
Such abrupt change]{.mark} has led scientists to [warn of **"tipping
points,"** or **thresholds** at which Earth systems can be radically
pushed into a qualitatively different state]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
instance, approximately 4°C of global warming could cause not only the
irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet, but also the dieback of
the boreal forest and its replacement by grasslands and open woodlands.

Whereas the Arctic Ocean is set to become darker due to climate change,
the forests of pine, spruce, and larch that comprise the sprawling
taiga---the world's largest land biome---may turn to turf that casts no
shadow. All the while, the boreal forest from Siberia to Canada is
burning each summer with heightened intensity, [[blackening the skies
and **thawing** the **permafrost**]{.mark} below, [push]{.mark}ing
**[climate goals]{.mark}** further **[out of
reach]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### 2NC \-- Melting Turn

[offsetting]{.underline} any clean energy gains.**

What's the connection between black carbon, the Arctic and the shipping
industry?

The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, and
rapidly approaching the point where such as the loss of sea ice and
melting of the Greenland ice sheet, are affecting ocean circulation
patterns in the North Atlantic.

[**[Black carbon]{.mark}** is solid particulate matter -- which we call
soot -- produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels in the engine
combustion chambers and then ejected into the atmosphere. This soot
[absorbs sunlight and by warming the surrounding atmosphere becomes a
**powerful**]{.mark} short-lived climate pollutant, aka **[super
pollutant]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although black carbon is not a
greenhouse gas, these emissions form "shipping's second largest cause of
global warming" after carbon dioxide, and makes up around one-fifth of
international shipping's already considerable climate impact.

[Overall, [black carbon contributes more than **three thousand times**
the **climate warming impact** of the same mass of **CO2**]{.mark} in
the atmosphere [over a 20 year period. In its recent]{.mark} 6th
[Assessment Report, the UN]{.mark} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) [**doubled** the estimate of the **warming potential** of

Although anoxic environments typically emit 3.4 times less total carbon
than oxic environments, and CO2 emissions continue to dominate,
[[enhanced **CH4 emissions** have **\~35 times more warming potential
than CO2**]{.mark} on a 100-year timescale]{.underline}. Therefore, an
increase of CH4 production will have marked impact on the PCF74,75. CH4
is produced by methanogenic microorganisms in anoxic subsurface
environments. [Most of the CH4 is metabolized by methanotrophs, and
[even a **few centimetres** of]{.mark} oxic environmental
[buffering]{.mark} can [facilitate]{.mark} the microbial **[oxidation of
all CH4]{.mark}** that passes through diffusively]{.underline}76,77. In
wetland environments, for example, methanotrophs typically oxidize
20--60% of the CH4 produced in **[subsurface
permafrost78]{.underline}**. Therefore, the most efficient routes of CH4
dispersion into the atmosphere are ebullition and aerenchymous
transference in thermokarst wetlands and lakes, \~4% of the global
methane budget24,27,79.

[[In **thawed permafrost**]{.mark}, microbial [carbon transformation is
impacted]{.mark} by soil moisture, temperature, light and nutrient
availability]{.underline}54,78,80--82. [[With]{.mark} increased
inundation related to changing precipitation or [**abrupt thaw**, CH4
release will **increase proportionally**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
anoxic environment expansion as microbial carbon transformation
increases83. [In a recent example, [in the tundra]{.mark} north of 60°
latitude, [subsurface CH4 oxidation **doubled**]{.mark}]{.underline} (to
\~5.5TgCH4 per year) **[[between 2000 and 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
indicating the potential for an increasing trend in methane release84.
However, in thawed permafrost, zones with higher redox potential create
ideal regions for methanotrophs to convert CH4 to CO2 at a similar
rapidity, making moisture and aeration essential determinants of
greenhouse gas composition16,27,62.

JG

The debate around Arctic sea ice extent has been a focal point for
climate scientists and policymakers. In the past, several predictions
have been made about the Arctic becoming ice-free during the summer
months. This article examines the accuracy of these predictions and the
integrity of the data used to support claims about Arctic sea ice
trends. Predictions of an Ice-Free Arctic In 2008, several scientists
and public figures predicted that the Arctic would be ice-free in the
summer within a few years. James Hansen, a NASA scientist, projected
this could happen in five to ten years. Similar forecasts were made by
Nobel laureate Al Gore and echoed by media outlets such as the BBC and
organizations like the Sierra Club. These predictions were largely based
on the assumption that rising carbon dioxide levels would lead to rapid
declines in Arctic sea ice. Examination of Recent Sea Ice Trends
**[[Contrary to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the [**[predictions]{.mark}**
made over a decade ago, observational data indicates that **[there has
been no significant trend in Arctic sea ice extent in the last 17
years.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Current]{.mark} sea ice [extent
is]{.mark} recorded to be [above the 21st-century average]{.mark},
challenging the notion of an imminent ice-free Arctic
summer.]{.underline} Data Analysis and Reporting Concerns The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA) has been criticized
for]{.mark} presenting [misleading information]{.mark} in its Arctic
Report Card]{.underline}. Critics argue that [NOAA\'s report [only
includes satellite data from 1979 onward]{.mark},]{.underline} allegedly
[[omitting earlier data which shows **lower ice extents before
1979**]{.mark},]{.underline} potentially [skewing the perception of a
long-term declining trend]{.underline}. The Significance of Pre-1979
Data Data from before 1979 suggest that the [[extent of]{.mark} Arctic
sea [ice was much lower in the early]{.mark} 19[70s]{.mark} compared to
the peak year of 1979]{.underline}. [Publications from that era,
including the Guardian and Time magazine, reported on the expansion of
snow and ice cover and speculate on the onset of a potential new ice
age.]{.underline} Climate Variability and Historical Context [Historical
[records reveal]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[periods of warming and
cooling]{.mark} have occurred [in the Arctic]{.mark} region throughout
the 20th century]{.underline}. For instance, the [19[70s]{.mark}
experienced a significant [cooling]{.mark} period, which led to an
expansion of Arctic sea ice]{.underline}. This period [[was]{.mark}
[preceded by]{.mark} a [warming]{.mark} trend in the early part of the
century, with several reports noting the substantial melting of Arctic
ice and glaciers.]{.underline} Analysis of Temperature and Ice Cover
Trends [[Temperature]{.mark} graphs]{.underline} [from untampered U.S.
[data]{.mark}]{.underline} [[show higher temperatures]{.mark} and more
frequent hot days [during the first half of the 20th century, followed
by]{.mark} a [cooling]{.mark} trend leading up to the
1970s]{.underline}. This cooling is mirrored in the Arctic, with
[reports from the 1950s indicating a warmer Arctic and reduced ice cover
compared to subsequent decades]{.underline}. Conclusion The
**[[predictions of an imminent ice-free Arctic have not
materialized]{.mark}]{.underline}** as forecasted, and the [lack of a

The Real Monster: Climate

[It's also become commonplace to say that the Arctic will be
increasingly threatened by climate change. Unfortunately, if there's
anything false about this claim, it is that **[the threat is already
here]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The Arctic is actively, rapidly
undergoing climate-driven]{.mark} catastrophic [transformation]{.mark}
right now]{.underline}. **[[On any reasonable timescale for climate
mitigation, the Arctic as we know it now will be
gone.]{.underline}]{.mark}** An ice-free Arctic Ocean in September, the
time of year when sea ice is at its minimum, may come in the next few
years, and [ice-free conditions are expected [by]{.mark} as early as
[2035]{.mark}]{.underline}. While sea ice can grow back if warming
factors are reversed, other environmental changes in the Arctic are
climate [tipping points]{.underline}, including permafrostcarbon.

Myths help us make sense of a world we do not understand. The Arctic
Ocean has been wrapped in myths precisely because it is little
understood --- as are both polar regions. Even Antarctica, which is as
far from the Arctic as geographically possible, is dragged into Arctic
mythmaking: "Absent military confrontation, the United States will not
contain the ambitions of China and Russia in the remote regions of the
Arctic or Antarctica." While there are good reasons for the U.S.
government to pay more attention to Antarctica and the rules-based order
there, the two regions are very, very different.

It is easy and tempting to rely on the Arctic mythology outlined above.
These legends and symbols are part and parcel of centuries of stories
about the Arctic that reflect truths from farther south. Some of the
language about the Arctic, particularly the concerns of Russian
dominance, is freighted with cultural fears about the United States
"wimping out."

It is more enjoyable to build up bogey monsters in the Arctic than it is
to figure out how to pay for aerospace defense modernization. It is
easier to count Russian icebreakers than to solve the U.S. Coast Guard's
icebreaker woes. It is far simpler to call for a U.S. Navy fleet in the
Arctic (or combatant command, or NATO command) than to solve the Navy's
shipbuilding woes, strategic woes, or ethical woes. It is also far more
comfortable to focus on competition with Russia and China in the Arctic,
and all the ways in which retreating ice gives us more ways of focusing
on that competition, than to think about where the ice is going. It is
definitely easier than stopping climate change.

And yet. The only way to understand the Arctic is to look beyond the
legends, to talk to those who live there --- and to place the Arctic
Ocean in its global context. It is not an ocean apart. The world's
oceans flow together in a colossal watery belt, and are best understood
as such. If Washington wants to tackle problems in the Arctic, it should
focus on the big, hard problems: talk seriously with Canada to fund and
reinvent NORAD, invest in and pursue new solutions to shipbuilding, and
move faster on climate change on many different fronts.

### 2NC \-- AT: Ice Melt

#### Too late to stop ice melt: irreversible thresholds are already crossed, and the best-case timescale is centuries away 

**Paddison 25** (Laura Paddison, CNN's senior climate writer based in
London. 3-12-2025, \"The Arctic is in trouble. The consequences will be
felt around the wo...\", CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/climate/arctic-sea-ice-heat-downward-spiral)
-- DOA: 6/26/25, MoState JG

The Arctic is the early warning system for climate change and the loss
of sea ice is a clear sign it's in trouble, scientists say. It should be
reaching its annual maximum levels of ice at this time of year, but
instead it's experiencing record lows.

"I hope that these three months do not act as a precursor to a potential
new all-time minimum this summer, because the starting point to the
melting season is not good," said Mika Rantanen, a researcher at the
Finnish Meteorological Institute.

Arctic sea ice bottoms out at the end of summer in September. The last
18 years have seen the lowest sea ice levels on record, a downward
spiral that will continue, scientists say.

[[The Arctic will be ice-free in]{.mark} the
[summer]{.mark}]{.underline} at some point [[by 2050]{.underline},
**[even if humans stop]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[pumping out climate
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to a report co-authored by
Dirk Notz, head of sea ice at the University of Hamburg.
"[**[It's]{.mark}** basically **[too late]{.mark}** to prevent
that]{.underline}," he told CNN.

The [[first ice-free day]{.mark} could]{.underline} even
[happen]{.underline} before the end of [[this
decade]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a separate study published in
December.

Sea ice loss is not only damaging to wildlife, plants and the roughly 4
million people who live in the Arctic --- it has global consequences.
Sea ice acts like a giant mirror, reflecting the sunlight away from the
Earth and back into space. As it shrinks, more of the sun's energy is
absorbed by the dark ocean, which accelerates global heating.

Part of the reason for the recent run of record-low sea ice is the
unusual heat in the Arctic, which has been warming around four times
faster than the global average.

Early February's extreme warmth "was one of the strongest ever
recorded," said Rantanen, who estimates it was probably in the top three
of the most intense warming events in the satellite era since the 1970s.

The Arctic landscape is changing too, said the NSIDC's Twila Moon.

The [[thawing]{.underline}]{.mark} of permafrost --- a jumble of soil,
rocks and sediment held together by ice [--- [is
pervasive]{.mark}]{.underline}, she said, releasing planet-heating
carbon dioxide and methane.

Wildfires have become more frequent and intense and wildfire seasons run
longer. Last year marked the third time in five years significant,
widespread blazes ripped across the Arctic.

These changes are fundamentally altering the ecosystem. For thousands of
years, the shrubby landscape of the Arctic tundra stored carbon, but
wildfires and thawing permafrost mean that this region is now releasing
more carbon than it stores, according to NOAA.

"There's just an overwhelming amount of change happening in the Arctic
right now," said Moon.

What happens in the Arctic has repercussions across the planet.

A warmer Arctic means land ice --- glaciers and ice sheets --- melts
faster, adding to sea level rise. The Greenland ice sheet already sheds
around 280 billion tons of ice a year, enough to cover the whole of
Manhattan in a layer of ice roughly 2 miles thick.

Rapid warming in the region also weakens the jet stream, altering
weather systems that affect billions of people, said Jennifer Francis, a
senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center. A more meandering
jet stream "makes weather conditions linger longer, leading to more
persistent heat waves, cold spells, drought, and stormy periods," she
told CNN.

Scientists say [some]{.underline} of these [changes can be
[reversed]{.mark} if humans stop pumping out planet-heating gases, but
**[on timescales]{.mark} ranging [from hundreds of years to]{.mark} many
[thousands]{.mark}**[. Many]{.mark} of these [changes are]{.mark}
considered "relatively **[irreversible]{.mark}**," Moon
said]{.underline}.

There's another threat, too. Scientists' ability to keep tabs on the
swift-changing Arctic is being jeopardized by geopolitical upheaval.

Russia's war on Ukraine has meant scientists from the country, the
largest Arctic nation, have been excluded from international
collaboration. This has already undermined scientists' ability to track
what's happening in the Arctic, according to a recent study.

In the US, the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to government
climate science jobs is creating serious concern, especially as many
measurement systems are maintained by the US. With less US expertise and
fewer US scientists, "it would become much, much harder to understand
what's happening" at a vital time for the Arctic, said the University of
Hamburg's Notz.

What's happening in the Arctic is one of the starkest indications of
"how powerful we humans have become in changing the face of our planet,"
Notz said. "We are able to wipe out entire landscapes."

#### Ice-free summers are inevitable, even with extreme emissions cuts

[Ice-free summers inevitable even with sharp emissions cuts]{.underline}
and likely to result in more extreme heatwaves and floods

[[It is]{.mark} now [too late to save]{.mark} summer [Arctic]{.mark} sea
[ice]{.mark}, research has shown, and scientists say preparations need
to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern
hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.]{.underline}

Analysis shows that [**[even if]{.mark}** greenhouse gas
**[emissions]{.mark}** are **[sharply reduced]{.mark}**, **[the Arctic
will be ice-free]{.mark}** in September in coming decades]{.underline}.
The study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to
rise, the first ice-free summer could be in the 2030s, a decade earlier
than previous projections.

The research shows that [90% of the melting is the result of
human-caused global heating]{.underline}, with natural factors
accounting for the rest.

Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has shrunk by
13% a decade, in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Arctic
sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer, in September,
and in 2021 it was at its second lowest extent on record.

"Unfortunately [it has become too late to save Arctic summer sea
ice]{.underline}," [said Prof Dirk Notz, of the University of Hamburg,
Germany, who was part of the study team]{.underline}. "As scientists,
we've been warning about the loss of Arctic summer sea ice for decades.
This is now the first major component of the Earth system that we are
going to lose because of global warming. People didn't listen to our
warnings.

"This brings another warning bell, that the kind of projections that
we've made for other components of the Earth system will start unfolding
in the decades to come."

Other climate scientists said in 2022 that the world was on the brink of
multiple disastrous tipping points.

Prof Seung-Ki Min, of Pohang University, South Korea, who led the new
study, said: "The most important impact for human society will be the
increase in weather extremes that we are experiencing now, such as
heatwaves, wildfires and floods. We need to reduce CO2 emissions more
ambitiously and also prepare to adapt to this faster Arctic warming and
its impacts on human society and ecosystems."

In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded
that the Arctic would not lose its summer ice if emissions were cut
sharply and global temperature rises were limited to 2C. But the [new
research]{.underline}, published in the journal Nature Communications,
[projects the loss of summer sea ice in the 2050s in the low emissions
scenario.]{.underline}

The IPCC report concluded that the [Arctic would lose its summer ice in
the 2040s in intermediate and high emissions scenarios, but the new
research advances that by a decade into the 2030s.]{.underline}

In the study, the scientists first established how much rising
greenhouse gases have contributed to ice melting compared with natural
factors such as variation in the sun's intensity and emissions from
volcanoes. "Humans really are to blame for almost all the loss of Arctic
sea ice we have been observing," Notz said.

The scientists used this information to model future melting and found
that the models underestimated the pace of melting compared with
observations of ice in the Arctic from 1979 to 2019.

Calibrating the models to be consistent with the observations led to the
projections of faster melting and an ice-free summer even in the low
emissions scenario. In the intermediate and high emissions scenarios,
August and October also become ice-free by about 2080, the study found.

It is not possible to pinpoint a particular year for the first ice-free
summer because of natural variability in the climate system.

Faster melting of Arctic sea ice leads to a vicious circle of more
heating, because the dark ocean exposed as ice melts absorbs more heat
from the sun. The result is faster warming in the Arctic, and scientists
have increasing evidence that this is weakening the jet stream and
leading to more extreme weather events in North America, Europe and
Asia.

The searing heatwave in the Pacific north-west of America in 2021 and
the catastrophic floods in Pakistan in 2022 are the type of events that
may be increasing in likelihood because of a weaker jet stream.

Min said faster Arctic heating also accelerated the melting of the
Greenland ice cap, driving up sea level, and the melting of permafrost
regions, releasing more greenhouse gases. Polar bears and other wildlife
in the Arctic and the Indigenous people of the region all rely on sea
ice.

Prof Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center
at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US, who was not part of the
study team, said: "The key message is that [[we are]{.mark} pretty much
[destined to lose]{.mark} the Arctic's sea [ice cover]{.mark} in late
summer. [The question is: when]{.mark}]{.underline} will this occur?

"Over the past decade, there has not been much of a downward trend in
September sea ice, which reflects the natural variability in the system.
This hiatus will not last, but it shows the difficulties in making
predictions. About a decade ago, I mused that the Arctic might lose its
summer sea ice by 2030. That may have been an overly aggressive
statement. While from the present study 2030 is still in the running,
I'm going with sometime in the 2040s -- that's still not very far away."

carbon flux vary greatly, from 0.19 to 210 gCO2-C m−2 per year, with
uncertainty driven by observational challenges, and require ground-based
validation170. While snow has long been recognized as one of the most
important controls on permafrost resilience to thaw, cold season carbon
emissions are more important to annual emissions than previously
thought14,87,171. Future research should minimize uncertainties
surrounding the estimation of seasonal thaw and year-round soil
respiration through ongoing remote sensing and in situ validation7,40.

It is perhaps surprising, then, that [there is [**little scholarly

2\. [[Methodological **issues**]{.mark} relating to food **prices** and
political **instability**]{.underline}

Countries that are affected by food shortages tend to be prone to
conflict, violence or instability. Nineteen countries that the Food and
Agricultural Organisation (FAO) classifies as being in a protracted food
crisis are also affected by conflict and violence (Martin-Shields &
Stojets, 2018). Thus, [[scholars have **pondered**]{.mark} about [the
**relationship** between]{.mark} the [**availability** of food and
**probability** of conflict]{.mark}, **especially** after 2008 when the
media reported on many food related **protests** in
low-and-middle-income **countries**]{.underline} (Van Weezel, 2016).
Furthermore, Smith (2014, p. 679) states that "Dramatic weather events,
diversion of crops for fuel production, and continuing volatility in
international grain markets have led many to postulate that urban food
riots will become more frequent, pervasive and disruptive in the
future."

There is a body of literature which argues that grievances (or relative
deprivation) lead to incentives for conflict. Literature in this vein
argues that rising food prices increase the propensity for protests and
food riots. Young men in particular may join rebel groups to gain access
to food (Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011, Raleigh et al., 2015). However,
[[finding]{.mark} the **[ev]{.mark}**idence to **support** these
assertions [is **difficult**]{.mark} [because]{.mark} the
[relationship]{.mark} between food prices (as an indicator of the
**availability** or **accessibility** of food) and **conflict**
[is]{.mark} both [**complex** and **influenced** by]{.mark} many [other
**factors**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith 2014, van Weezel, 2016,
Martin-Shields & Stojets, 2018). Therefore, [[it becomes
difficult]{.mark} [to find]{.mark} evidence of [causal linkages between
**food**]{.mark} prices [and **conflict**]{.mark}. Moreover, the
**[ev]{.mark}**idence [may be **contradictory**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This section explores the [methodological issues]{.underline} that [make
the interaction between food prices and political instability difficult
to **conceptualize** and **assess**.]{.underline}

[[Endogeneity challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It is difficult to **study** the causal link between **food prices**
and **political instability** because they are **endogenous** and there
is **limited ev**idence]{.underline}. According to Martin-Shields &
Stojets (2018) [there are two key sources of endogeneity, which are (1)
[**unobserved confounding factors** and]{.mark} (2) **[reverse
causality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Confounding factors are strongly
correlated with both food insecurity and conflict. For example, [there
is much evidence which **suggests** that national income is negatively
**correlated** with violent conflict and positively correlated with food
security. Likewise, state capacity is also related to violence and food
security]{.underline}. [[Reverse causality occurs when it is
**difficult** to ascertain the]{.mark} [**direction** of]{.mark} the
**[causal links]{.mark}**: does food insecurity exacerbate **conflict**
or does conflict **contribute** to **food insecurity**?]{.underline} (De
Winne & Peersman, 2021; Raleigh et al., 2015). [Some scholars have dealt
with reverse causality by focusing their analysis on international food
prices. They argue that **international food prices** are **unlikely**
to be unaffected by local **conflicts** and as such there is less need
for **concern** about endogeneity]{.underline}. However, it is still
possible that [[global food]{.mark} prices can [be **confounded** by
**variables** such as]{.mark} global [**economic activity** or **oil
prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith, 2014). Some quantitative studies
address endogeneity by including fixed effects or instrumental variables
in models, but De Winne and Peersman (2021) are not convinced that this
approach eliminates endogeneity.

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [**[disruption]{.mark}** to
the agriculture and food supply chains,]{.underline} particularly in the
first half of 2020, most [**sector [shocks]{.mark}** were **[absorbed
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with trade and markets recovering during
the year. Average gross farm receipts for OECD and emerging economies
actually increased in 2020, and the sector was the best performing or
least affected economically in several countries. At the same time,
restricting measures impacted the food security of many low income or
unemployed consumers.

This relative [**economic [resilience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} and food sector [was largely [due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} sector specific policy measures undertaken by
governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
restrictions. Many [[governments **moved**]{.mark} **swiftly** [to
keep]{.mark} agricultural [supply chains]{.mark}
functioning]{.underline}, including by [[designating ag]{.mark}riculture
and food as an **[essential]{.mark} sector**]{.underline} and by
ensuring international co-operation to limit trade disruptions.

An estimated 776 unique policy response measures were adopted by
governments of 54 OECD and emerging economies in 2020. These measures
were widely diverse, highlighting the breadth and responsiveness of
public actions to address the impact of the crisis. Close to 20% of the
total were urgent measures, adopted in order to contain the pandemic
while keeping food and agriculture supply chains working. Just under 70%
of measures took the form of temporary relief, seeking to contain the
impact of the crisis on agriculture and food sector actors, and should
be phased out as the crisis recedes. Most of the remaining measures
(10%) were "no regrets" policies with the potential to improve the
long-term resilience of the agro-food sector, and which have the
potential to be scaled up further. At the same time, 11% of measures had
the potential to distort markets or be harmful to the environment.

A first assessment of budgetary expenditures in response to the COVID-19
crisis suggests that a [minimum of USD [157 billion]{.mark} was
[**earmarked** in funding]{.mark} or]{.underline} offered in
[financing]{.underline} means [to the sector]{.underline} in 2020,
including USD 75 billion in OECD countries and USD 82 billion in

**lower**]{.underline}, partly [[reflecting]{.mark} the **overall

(www.usda.gov/oce/ag-outlook-forum). We were expecting better weather,

severely dampened expectations for 2020 and 2021. And while the timing
and pace of the economic recovery remain uncertain, the
[**fundamentals** of U.S. [ag]{.mark}riculture are [**sufficiently

[agricultural [exports during]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 period appear to have been
**[hold]{.underline}**ing **[up]{.underline}** relatively [well compared
to overall U.S. exports]{.underline}. In the first seven months of 2020,
U.S. ag exports were down 3.5 percent from last year compared to a
decrease of 18 percent for non-ag exports. Just recently we have seen a
major uptick in Chinese purchases. For instance, while U.S. soybean
exports had started off slow this year, since July, China has purchased
14 MMTs. Over the past few months, China has also signaled the intent to
purchase corn at amounts exceeding its 7.2 MMT quota if they all

### 1NC -- BioDiversity Defense

#### Biodiversity loss won't cause extinction

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. **[One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich,
2012), with the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than
0.001% per year (Rockström et al., 2009). **[There is little evidence
that this particular 0.001% annual loss is a
threshold]{.underline}**---**[and it is hard to imagine any data that
would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}**
(Brook, Ellis, Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams,
2013). A better question is whether one can imagine any scenario by
which the loss of too many species leads to the collapse of societies
and environmental disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute
number of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

**[While [there are data that relate local reductions in species
richness]{.mark} to altered ecosystem function, [these results do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The **[data are small-scale experiments in which plant productivity, or
nutrient retention is reduced as species numbers decline
locally]{.underline}** (Vellend, 2017), or are local observations of
increased variability in fisheries yield when stock diversity is lost
(Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those are not existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[To make the link even more tenuous, [there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [biod]{.mark}iversity [is]{.mark} even
[declining at local scales]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Vellend et al., 2013,
Vellend et al., 2017). **[Total [planetary biod]{.mark}iversity [may be
in decline, but local]{.mark} and regional [biod]{.mark}iversity [is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace]{.mark}
local [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely
to flinch at this conclusion, **[there is growing skepticism regarding
the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an
existential risk for humans]{.underline}** (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
**[Obviously [if all biod]{.mark}iversity [disappeared civilization
would end]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[but no one is forecasting]{.mark}
the loss of [all species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that
the loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but
not one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic,
but plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as
many as half of its species. **[If global biodiversity were halved, but
at the same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable,
what would be the mechanism for an end-of-civilization or even end of
human prosperity scenario?]{.underline}** **[Extinctions and
[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss are ethical]{.mark} and spiritual
[losses]{.mark}, but perhaps [not an existential
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Brun et al. (2022) found that a few tall, high-SLA plant species had
stronger effects on primary productivity than any measure of functional
diversity. [We add [data on species]{.mark} rarity to [show]{.mark} that
ongoing [biodiversity]{.mark} [loss is **unlikely** to **hamper**
ecosystem productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}, a core insight we feel the
authors missed.

Main text

Brun et al. (2022) present important new results regarding the
controversial relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Studying plant communities from the French and Swiss Alps, they assessed
if the presence or abundance of certain plant species were linked to
higher levels of pivotal ecosystem functions, here primary productivity.
They identified 'key' species, which have a decisive role in overall
productivity, and 'keystone' species, which have disproportionally large
productivity effects given their abundance, and which are a subset of
the key species. Out of 2918 plant species found, they identified 38 key
species, of which 11 qualified as keystone species. They found that the
five key species with largest effects on productivity jointly explained
more deviance in ecosystem productivity than any measure of functional
composition. The results provide evidence supporting the Trait Driver
Theory (Enquist et al. 2015), which is related to the 'mass-ratio
hypothesis' (Grime 1998; Garnier et al. 2004), and against the
'complementary resource use hypothesis' (Naeem et al. 1994). Key and
keystone species were found to be taller and have higher than average
specific leaf area.

Brun et al. (2022) state in their introduction that understanding the
relationships between species richness, functional traits and ecosystem
function "is pivotal for assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss".
Their study builds on solid empirical data, a strong analytical
framework and deals with real-world communities, shaped by abiotic
environmental filtering and non-artificial extinction processes,
something rarely undertaken (e.g. Vile et al. 2006; Mokanyet al. 2008).
Therefore, we miss an explicit evaluation of the assumptions underlying
the 'rivet-popper hypothesis' (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). In this powerful
narrative, the popping rivets leading to the crash of the plane are
juxtaposed to species going extinct, leading to ecosystem collapse. The
metaphor has inspired and gained some support from the so-called random
deletion experiments (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997; Hector et al. 1999), in
which all species are assumed to have equal extinction probability.

We plotted a rank-abundance diagram of the species in the data of Brun
et al. (2022) based on their regional occupancy (using mean local
abundance yielded qualitatively equal results, with a strong positive
correlation between regional occupancy and local abundance; Spearman rho
= 0.93, p \<\< 0.001). [We categorized species as either key, keystone,
redlisted or other and superimposed species]{.underline} category on the
diagram (Fig. 1). Redlist status was derived from the redlists for
vascular plants of Switzerland (Bornand et al. 2016) and the French
region Rhˆone-Alpes (Kristo et al. 2015). We found that key and keystone
species strongly tended to be regionally widespread and locally abundant
species, whereas species threatened with regional extinction were found
in the tail of the rank-abundance distribution. [A one-way anova of
difference in log-transformed frequencies revealed that key and keystone
species did not differ in abundance but were both significantly more
abundant than all other categories and that redlisted species were
significantly less abundant than all other categories]{.underline} (p
\<\< 0.001, TukeyHSD). [[It appears evident that]{.mark} the
[contribution of **rare species** to ecosystem **productivity** is a
weak argument]{.mark} for conservation actions in their
favour]{.underline}. In fact, Fig. 2a of the original paper shows that
many species leads to reduced ecosystem productivity when present.

A revised version of Ehrlich's aeroplane metaphor could sound: The wings
are effectively attached to the body of the plane by a small number of
large rivets of key importance, while numerous small rivets, most of
which tiny as needles, serve no other function than mere decoration
(Gould & Lewontin 1979). [[The biodiversity **crisis**]{.mark} and its
derived biotic homogenization **[implies]{.mark}** that already common
[**key species** increase in occupancy and **abundance**]{.mark},
[while]{.mark} initially [**un-common** species]{.mark} decrease or
[vanish]{.mark} **completely**]{.underline} (Finderup Nielsen et al.
2019; Kempel et al. 2020).

[[There is solid **evidence** for **loss** of]{.mark} endangered
[species]{.mark} **disproportionately** happening [in
**low-productive**]{.mark} **natural [ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Walker et al. 2004; Wassen et al. 2005), [[which]{.mark} [we
show]{.mark} have **[very low extinction risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Moreover, [t[he plant **species** critical to human sustenance are all
**superabundant crops**]{.mark}, such as wheat, corn and
rice]{.underline}. [We propose it is time the scientific **community
acknowledge** that arguments for [**biodiversity** conservation should
not be sought in **optimization** of **productivity**]{.mark},
decomposition rate or -- in general -- in efficiency of ecosystem
**processes**]{.underline}. [[We are]{.underline}]{.mark} not
misanthropic, but rather [[confident that **disciplines**]{.mark} such
as agronomy, forestry, technical sciences, geophysics and medicine [will
look after the well-being of our]{.mark} own

When the United Nations welcomed heads of state to the 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, a global consensus was reached to take vital steps to
save the planet. To that end, more than 170 nations gave their support
to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. But it was not the
only treaty at the summit. There was also a Convention on Biological
Diversity.

**[The climate change treaty is well understood internationally --- even
if the Trump administration and its congressional allies continue to
engage in dangerous denialism and obstruction.]{.underline}**

The biological diversity treaty is less well understood, especially in
the U.S., which has yet to join the more than 190 parties to the
agreement.

In 2020, Russ Feingold wants to change that.

Working as an ambassador for an ambitious international Campaign for
Nature, Feingold will in the new year be using his prominence --- as a
former three-term senator from Wisconsin who later served as the U.S.
Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region of Africa --- to get an urgent
conversation going in Africa (where he is highly regarded for his
long-term commitment to the continent) and in the U.S.

"The first thing is you have to get a baseline awareness of what the
problem is," said Feingold, who acknowledges that "there is a huge
learning curve."

Huge. But not insurmountable.

So let's start 2020 by putting things in perspective.

This is how Feingold explained things: "**[A major report from 150
leading scientists from around the world released on May 6, 2019, shows
that [the crisis facing wildlife]{.mark} and nature [is]{.mark} even
[worse than previously understood]{.mark}. Up to a million species are
threatened with extinction, many within decades. And the threats posed
to people from the destruction of nature are just as serious as those
posed by climate change]{.underline}**."

As a senator and a special envoy, Feingold was passionate about
addressing climate change, and he remains so now. But he wants people to
know that the climate crisis and the extinction threat pose distinct
challenges.

"If you say something to people about (the destruction of nature), they
look at you and they go, 'Oh. Climate change.' Yet, it's not the same!"
he explained.

Of course, the former senator said, **[climate and biodiversity concerns
are "crucially interrelated]{.underline}**." Of course, he added, "We
have to understand both of them and respond to both of them."

But Feingold wants people to recognize that when scientists describe
**[[the five]{.mark} key [causes of the loss of biodiversity]{.mark},
"[Climate]{.mark} change is third! It\'s enormously important. But first
is [land use]{.mark} --- agriculture, mining --- just impinging on
forests or natural areas. Second is what\'s called 'the exploitation of
organisms': [hunting, overfishing, cutting]{.mark} down [trees]{.mark}.
That\'s not climate. That\'s just harvesting stuff." (Fourth is
[pollution]{.mark}. Fifth is [invasive species]{.mark}.)]{.underline}**

So this is another urgent issue to concern ourselves with at a time when
there are already so many urgent issues. Feingold acknowledges that it
may be daunting to think about additional threats and additional
challenges. But, he explained, we are not starting from scratch.

Real work has been done to address the crisis. Countries have not just
signed on to the biological diversity treaty. Many have acted. As the
Campaign for Nature noted, "world leaders have committed to protecting
17 percent of land and 10 percent of the ocean by 2020 and governments
are on track to meet these global targets."

**[The [progress toward meeting these goals has been impressive.]{.mark}
Today, Feingold noted, roughly "15 percent of land and 7 percent of the
ocean are protected globally, but individual [countries]{.mark} have
helped [demonstrate]{.mark} that more [ambitious targets]{.mark} are
possible to meet. Ninety countries have protected more than 17 percent
of their land (the current global target), 27 have already protected
more than 30 percent, and a few --- including Namibia, Bhutan and
Venezuela --- are close to or even past protecting half of their
land."]{.underline}**

That's the good news.

**[Unfortunately, Feingold noted, "The scientists are now saying, 'Guess
what? We\'re not there, and [that\'s not even adequate]{.mark}.' They
are saying [we need 30-by-30 and 50-by-50]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[As in: [30 percent protected by 2030 and 50 percent protected by
2050]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

-- DOA: 6/8/24, MoState JG

[Utilities and state governments are pushing full steam ahead with
**[decarb]{.mark}**onization plans that **[will lead to costlier energy
and]{.mark} power [blackouts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [nation's
electricity grid [operators, regulators, and]{.mark} reliability
[watchdogs]{.mark} alike [testify]{.mark} that **[closing fossil fuel
and nuclear]{.mark}** electricity generation [poses an **imminent
threat**]{.mark} to the reliability of the power grid]{.underline}.

"The problem is the [[subtraction]{.mark} of dispatchable resources such
as coal and gas]{.underline}," Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner
Mark Christie said during testimony to Congress last year. "The core of
the problem is actually very simple. We are retiring dispatchable
\[[quickly controllable\] generating resources \[[coal and]{.mark}
natural [gas]{.mark}\] at a pace and in an amount that [is]{.mark} far
[too fast and]{.mark} far [too great]{.mark} and is threatening our
ability to keep the lights on.]{.underline}"

Christie warned that "the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [is [heading for]{.mark} a very
[catastrophic]{.mark} situation in terms of
[reliability]{.mark},]{.underline}" and he is far from alone in his
assessment.

"When you do the math --- when you look at the rate of retirements, you
look at the rate of growth, and you add in the current rate of
throughput for our queue --- we are headed for some trouble. And that
trouble is likely to find us later in the decade," Manu Asthana, CEO of
PJM, the grid operator for parts of the eastern United States, told the
Electric Power Supply Association during his keynote speech at their
Competitive Power Summit last year.

**[["\[I\]t is not possible to run]{.mark}]{.underline}** an electric
system --- **[[a reliable electric system]{.underline}]{.mark}** ---
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} just **[[wind, solar, and
storage]{.underline}]{.mark}**," testified a [representative of New York
ISO, the grid operator for the Empire State, to the House Subcommittee
on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security.]{.underline}

In the same hearing, a PJM representative stated that "[[one
megawatt]{.mark} of wind, solar or battery [isn't enough to replace one
megawatt of]{.mark} dispatchable [thermal]{.mark} \[fossil fuels and
nuclear\] generation. It takes many megawatts, and usually a range of
technologies available at different times, to effectively replace a
megawatt of thermal generation]{.underline}."

Utilities appear to be [adding enough gigawatts of wind and
solar,]{.underline} but these [**[sources suffer from fundamental
intermittency]{.mark}** flaws.]{.underline}

"A [megawatt of]{.underline} nameplate [wind and solar is not equal to a
megawatt of nameplate coal or gas. It's just reality]{.underline},"
explained FERC Commissioner James Danly. "\[If\] you lose eight gigs of
dispatchable, and you pick up 24 gigs of wind and solar, \[you may
think\] you're fine right now. You're not fine."

"The [[reliability of]{.mark} the BPS]{.underline} \[[Bulk Power System,
effectively synonymous with [the]{.mark} electric
[grid]{.mark}]{.underline}\] [[depends on]{.mark} the [operating]{.mark}
characteristics of the [replacement resources]{.mark}]{.underline},"
reports the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. "Merely
[[having available]{.mark} generation [capacity does not equate
to]{.mark} having the necessary [reliability]{.mark} services [or
ramping]{.mark} capability [to balance]{.mark}]{.underline} [generation
\[[supply\] and]{.mark} load \[[demand]{.mark}]{.underline}[\].]{.mark}
It is essential for the BPS to have resources [not only with the
capability to respond to frequency and voltage changes, but to actively
provide those services."]{.underline}

The problem highlighted by all these experts comes from the [important
difference between "nameplate capacity" and "accredited
capacity."]{.underline} Both terms describe a given power plant's
production capabilities. [Nameplate (or installed) capacity is the ideal
amount of electricity that could be generated given perfect
conditions]{.underline}, while [accredited capacity is what a generator
provides in reality]{.underline}.

"[Capacity factor" is the relevant measurement]{.underline}, showing the
[percentage of the nameplate capacity that a power plant actually
generates]{.underline}. The [[average capacity factor of
**wind**]{.underline}]{.mark} over the last decade [hovered around
**[35%]{.mark}**,]{.underline} according to [data from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. For **[solar]{.mark}**, it was about
**[25]{.mark}%**.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [natural **[gas]{.mark}**
combined cycle plants sat around **[55]{.mark}%**, **[coal]{.mark}** was
around **[50]{.mark}%**, and **[nuclear]{.mark}** had a **[93]{.mark}%**
capacity factor.]{.underline}

"A nameplate megawatt of wind or solar is simply not equal in terms of
capacity value to a nameplate megawatt of coal or gas or nuclear," said
Christie, the FERC commissioner.

[Yet,]{.underline} all around the nation, [utilities are planning to
close reliable fossil fuel and nuclear generation, despite the warnings
of these grid organizations]{.underline}.

As a result, [[adding dozens of gigawatts]{.underline} [of wind and
solar]{.underline}]{.mark} nameplate (installed) capacity buildout[,
[while retiring reliable generation will result]{.mark} in a [decrease
in]{.mark} overall [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is depicted in a
chart from the Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator's congressional
testimony. The orange line is the projected "load," which effectively
means electricity demanded from customers.

What MISO depicts --- and what the other grid operators, regulators, and
reliability watchdogs attest to --- is that growing chasm between the
facade of growth that wind and solar hold up and the reality of what is
actually generated. The impulsive [push for **[decarbonization
will]{.mark}** cause the **[hollow]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing
[**[out]{.mark}** of **[the]{.mark}** nation's electric
**[grid]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"Are the lights going to stay on?" Christie asks. "We're really at a
point where that's coming into serious question. Are the lights going to
stay on?"

### 1NC \-- No Cyber Attacks

#### No [catastrophic]{.underline} cyberattacks.

**Lewis 20** -- James Andrew, senior vice president and director of the
Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe", Center for Strategic &
International Studies,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe, 08-17-2020

A **[[catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark} was]{.underline}** first
**[predicted in the mid-1990s. Since then, predictions]{.underline}** of
a catastrophe **[have appeared regularly]{.underline}** and have entered
the popular consciousness**[.]{.underline}** As a trope, a cyber
catastrophe captures our imagination, but as analysis, **[it
[remains]{.mark} entirely [imaginary]{.mark} and is of dubious value as
a basis for policymaking[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack.

To qualify as **[a [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an event
**[[must produce]{.mark} damaging [mass]{.mark} effect, including
[casualties]{.mark} and destruction[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
**[fires that swept across California]{.underline}** last summer **[were
a catastrophe. Covid]{.underline}**-19 **[has been a
catastrophe]{.underline}**, especially in countries with inadequate
responses**[.]{.underline}** With man-made actions, however, a
catastrophe is harder to produce than it may seem, and **[for
[cyber]{.mark}attacks a [catastrophe requires]{.mark} organizational and
[technical skills]{.mark}]{.underline}** most **[[actors]{.mark} still
[do not possess.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It requires planning,
reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building
attack tools---things that require resources and experience. To achieve
mass effect, either a few central targets (like an electrical grid) need
to be hit or multiple targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is
the case with urban water systems), something that is itself an
operational challenge.

It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to produce it. The 2003 East
Coast blackout is the archetype for an attack on the U.S. electrical
grid. No one died in this blackout, and services were restored in a few
days. As electric production is digitized, vulnerability increases, but
many **[electrical companies have made cybersecurity a
priority.]{.underline}** Similarly, at water treatment plants, the
chemicals used to purify water are controlled in ways that make mass
releases difficult. In any case, it would take a massive amount of
chemicals to poison large rivers or lakes, more than most companies keep
on hand, and any release would quickly be diluted.

More importantly, **[there are powerful strategic constraints on those
who have the ability to launch catastrophe attacks. We
have]{.underline}** more than **[two decades of
experience]{.underline}** with the use of cyber techniques and
operations for coercive and criminal purposes and have a clear
understanding of motives, capabilities, and intentions**[. We can be
guided by the]{.underline}** methods of the **[Strategic Bombing
Survey]{.underline}**, which used **[interviews]{.underline}** and
observation (**[rather than hypotheses]{.underline}**) to determine
effect**[.]{.underline}** These methods apply equally to cyberattacks.
The conclusions we can draw from this are:

Nonstate actors and most states lack the capability to launch attacks
that cause physical damage at any level, much less a catastrophe. There
have been regular predictions every year for over a decade that nonstate
actors will acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two or three
years in what has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary return is
negligible, which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals (mostly Russian
speaking) who might have the necessary skills. One mystery is why these
groups have not been used as mercenaries, and this may reflect either a
degree of control by the Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary
acts) or a degree of caution by criminals.

**[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}** enough
[**[uncertainty]{.underline}** **[among potential attackers
about]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[ability to attribute]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that they are unwilling
to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
response to a catastrophic attack[. (]{.mark}They are perfectly willing
to take the risk of attribution for]{.underline}**
**[espionage]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[coercive cyber
actions.)]{.underline}**

No one has ever died from a cyberattack, and only a handful of these
attacks have produced physical damage. **[A cyberattack is not a nuclear
weapon, and]{.underline}** **[it is intellectually lazy to equate them
to nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** Using a tactical nuclear weapon
against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear war
distorts discussion of cyber warfare.

**[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national
strategies and interests.]{.underline}** **[[Their]{.mark} primary
[emphasis is]{.mark}]{.underline}** on **[[espionage and]{.mark}
political [coercion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and is in conflict with them, but they **[[have no interest in]{.mark}
launching [a catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[since it would]{.mark} certainly [produce]{.mark} an equally
[catastrophic retal]{.mark}iation[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Their goal is
to stay below the "use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, not start a war.

This has implications for the discussion of **[[inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, something that
**[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[never
occurred.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The concern over escalation deserves a
longer discussion, as there are both technological and strategic
constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and the
**[absence of inadvertent escalation [suggests]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}
degree of [control]{.mark} for cyber capabilities [by advanced
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Attackers]{.underline}**]{.mark},

for whom cyber is just one of the tools for confrontation, **[[seek to

[escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The United States has two opponents
(China and Russia) who are capable of damaging cyberattacks. **[Russia
has demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid,
but]{.underline}** neither **[Russia]{.underline}** nor China **[would
be well served by a similar attack on the United States.]{.underline}**
Iran is improving and may reach the point where it could use
cyberattacks to cause major damage, but it would only do so when it has
decided to engage in a major armed conflict with the United States. Iran
might attack targets outside the United States and its allies with less
risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli
critical infrastructure. North Korea has not yet developed this kind of
capability.

One major failing of **[catastrophe [scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** is
that they **[[discount]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[robustness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and resilience **[[of modern
econ]{.mark}omies.]{.underline}** These economies present multiple
targets and configurations; **[they are harder to damage through
cyberattack than they look, [given]{.mark} the growing]{.underline}**
(albeit incomplete) **[[attention to cybersecurity]{.mark}; [and]{.mark}
experience shows that [people]{.mark} compensate for damage and
[quickly]{.mark} repair or [rebuild.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This was one
of the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1

This is a short overview of why catastrophe is unlikely. Several longer
CSIS reports go into the reasons in some detail. Past performance may
not necessarily predict the future, but **[[after 25 years
without]{.mark} a single catastrophic cyberattack]{.underline}**, we
should invoke the concept cautiously, if at all. **[[Why]{.mark} then,
it is [raised so often?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Some of the explanation for the emphasis on cyber catastrophe is
hortatory. When the author of one of **[[the first
reports]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[in the 1990s]{.underline}**) to sound
the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why he had warned of a
cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not going to happen, his
reply was that he **[[hoped to scare people into
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"Catastrophe is nigh; we must act\" was
possibly a reasonable strategy 22 years ago, but no longer.

The resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant
must be taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare,
and this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. **[[The]{.mark} long experience of living under the [shadow
of nuclear annihilation still shapes]{.mark} American [thinking]{.mark}
and conditions the United States [to expect extreme outcomes.]{.mark}
American thinking is [also]{.mark} shaped [by]{.mark} the experience of
[9/11]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fears of another 9/11
reinforce the memory of nuclear war in driving the catastrophe trope,
but when applied to cyberattack, these scenarios do not track with
operational requirements or the nature of opponent strategy and
planning. The contours of cyber warfare are emerging, but they are not
always what we discuss. Better policy will require greater objectivity.

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

[One of the]{.underline} greatest [**reservation**s against
communicating a willingness to take punitive actions concerns the risk
of **escalation** and increased tension due to a more
assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture. Yet when looking into
possible responses -- retaliation [in **cyber**]{.mark}space, for
example -- a number of [**"self-dampening" mechanisms** appear]{.mark}
to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be **applicable** to many types of
responses]{.underline}.30 [One example is the requirement to
establish]{.underline} some level of **[attribution]{.underline}** of
aggression on which to base a response. As discussed above, while
attribution is rarely impossible, [it can be a time-consuming and
technically-challenging endeavor. In a high-stakes scenario [the
**time** taken to get **attribution**]{.mark} **as [right]{.mark} as
possible** [means]{.mark} there will be **[plenty]{.mark} of time** to
**[think twice]{.mark}** about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to
**[lean on diplomatic measures]{.mark} in parallel**. An example of a
self-dampening mechanism related to the **cyber** domain is the [**large
investment** required to develop]{.mark} **credible [offens]{.mark}ive
capabilities**. Moreover, **an [offens]{.mark}ive cyber capability**
[is]{.mark} **a [transitory]{.mark} tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability
to access a computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only
[temporary]{.mark}** [and **depend**]{.mark}**ent** [on]{.mark} a **very
[rapid]{.mark} and ongoing [patching of
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the
cyber instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might
have a de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility
to the opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**self-[limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to
the challenge of **identifying** and **developing targets** of adequate
strategic significance -- **not too much, not too little** -- to achieve
the desired effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying
**["middle range"]{.mark} punitive [actions]{.mark}** that are
**[proportionate]{.mark}** to the aggression threatened or suffered
[will]{.mark} also **self-[limit]{.mark}** the escalatory potential. [It
is **unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the **interest** of **any**]{.mark}
hybrid aggressor [to pursue **a**]{.mark}**n escalatory
[spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way
to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight
and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

It should be noted that [there is disagreement among]{.underline} some
**[experts]{.underline}** [regarding the **actual extent of
cyberthreats** against C3 assets]{.underline}, in particular those for
nuclear operations. [[NC3 assets are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, in
themselves **[[complex]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} are [part
of a **wider**]{.mark} -- itself **more complex** -- **'[ecosystem' of
networks]{.mark}**, **software** and **hardware** making]{.underline} up
the entire NC3 system. Offensive [cyber capabilities]{.underline} are
without doubt highly sophisticated at present, and such capabilities
[are in the hands of a **small number of actors**]{.underline}. In other
words, [[cyberthreats]{.mark} need to be **tailored to the targeted

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [could [result in **scepticism**

Limited Costliness of Offensive Cyber Effects

Even under circumstances in which a state may possess the right cyber
response capabilities at the desired time, [its [response may not
generate]{.mark} **[sufficient costs]{.mark}** against the target [to be
**perceived as escalatory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.41 Fundamental limits
on the cost-generation potential of offensive cyber operations stem from
the fact that [cyber capabilities lack the **physical violence** of
conventional and nuclear ones.]{.underline} [Cyber weapons target
**data**; they disrupt, manipulate, degrade, or destroy data resident on
networks and systems or in transit]{.underline}.42 Moreover, [aside from
those cyber capabilities that permanently destroy data and for which
there are no backups to which a target can revert, [cyber effects are
**temporary** and]{.mark} often **[reversible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The utility of military instruments of power for the purposes of
coercion or brute force inheres in their abilities to
inflict]{.underline}---or credibly threaten to inflict---[**significant
damage** and **harm** against a target state]{.underline} (its civilian
population or its military forces) [to achieve a political
objective]{.underline}.43 [Cyber weapons]{.underline} could be (and have
been) used to disrupt an adversary's networks and systems---overwhelming
them such that they temporarily lose the ability to function or the
target loses confidence in their reliability---or [even to produce
destructive effects by destroying data resident on these
systems]{.underline} or, in rarer circumstances, [producing effects in
the physical realm.]{.underline}44 While conducting multiple
cyberattacks against a targeted state's critical national
infrastructure, for example, could in theory generate significant
economic and national security consequences, [the **temporal aspects**
of offensive cyber]{.underline} [operations as described above **limit**
the ability of even the most **capable states** to sustain persistent,
high-cost effects against **multiple strategic targets**]{.underline}
over time. [There is simply **no guarantee** that a state can generate
**significant costs** against a target in th]{.underline}e context of an
[unfolding crisis]{.underline}. This reality starkly contrasts with the
relative predictability and reliability of conventional effects. Indeed,
the empirical record has largely validated this claim; "[[the **vast
majority** of **malicious cyber activity** has taken place far below the
**threshold of armed conflict**]{.mark} between states, and has not
risen to the level that would]{.underline} [trigger such a
conflict]{.underline}."45 This is why, in Lin's parlance, "[going cyber
is **pre-escalatory**" and **[countervalue
cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} (those that target civilian, rather
than military, assets) [[occur "**all the time** now and are at the
**BOTTOM** of the escalation ladder]{.underline}]{.mark}" \[emphasis in
original\].46 Rather than their ability to wreak permanent, destructive
effects, [cyber operations are often prized for their **temporary** and
**reversible nature**]{.underline}.47

[One metric to assess the cost-generation potential of offensive cyber
is in terms of loss of life]{.underline}. By this measure, [cyber
operations are **unlikely** to inflict significant harm]{.underline}.
While theoretically possible that cyber operations could lead directly
to a loss of life, [[no one has reportedly **died to date** as a
direct]{.mark} [**result of a cyberattack** despite over **30 years** of
recorded cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.48 Even in hypothetical
catastrophic scenarios, [the cost in terms of human casualties is
**minimal**.]{.underline} For instance, [common worst-case scenarios of
cyberattacks revolve around the **loss of power** stemming from a
cyberattack]{.underline} on [an **electric grid**]{.underline}.49
However, even in this instance, [the conceivable damage from the loss of
power over an **extended period** is **far less** than that which could
be wreaked using **basic, limited conventional
capabilities**]{.underline}. To draw a comparison, when Hurricane Sandy
hit the United States' eastern seaboard in late October 2012, over 8.5
million people were left without power---with many going weeks and even
months before it was brought back online.50 [Yet a US National Hurricane
Center postmortem of Hurricane Sandy reported]{.underline} that of the
159 people in the United States killed either directly or indirectly,
only "[**about 50 of these deaths** were the result of extended power
outages during **cold weather**, which led to deaths from
**hypothermia**]{.underline}, falls in the dark by senior citizens, [or
**carbon monoxide** poisoning from improperly placed
generators]{.underline} or cooking devices."51 [If a cyberattack took
out power of a similar magnitude and duration of Hurricane Sandy, it is
conceivable that an **equivalent number** of casualties would result.
[The 2015 **synchronized cyberattacks** against **Ukrainian power
companies**]{.mark}, attributed to Russia]{.underline}, was the first
known example of an offensive cyber operation targeting a state's power
grid. [Its cost was ultimately low---service was temporarily [disrupted
to 225,000 customers]{.mark} for several hours, and energy providers
operated at a limited capacity for some time after service]{.underline}
was restored.52 [[There were no **reported
casualties**]{.underline}]{.mark} from this power outage. While any
casualty resulting from a cyberattack would certainly be lamentable[,
even **worst-case scenario** figures are **minor** in comparison to the
cost in **human lives** stemming from other, **even limited**, kinetic
military operations.]{.underline}

Difficulties and risks when ships navigating in Arctic shipping routes

[[Different from traditional shipping]{.mark} routes, the [difficulties,
and risks of]{.mark} ship [navigation in Arctic shipping]{.mark} routes
[are]{.mark} significantly [increased]{.mark} due to the unique
environment such as low temperature, sea ice, and high
latitude]{.underline} (Zhang et al., 2017). The difficulties and risks
of ship navigation in the Arctic shipping routes are analyzed with
regard to the various disturbing factors in the Arctic shipping routes
(shown in Fig. 9).

[Low temperature]{.underline} factors

The [**[extremely low temp]{.mark}**erature]{.underline} in the Arctic
shipping routes will [[affect]{.mark} the [crew]{.mark} psychologically
and physically to various degrees]{.underline}. In a low-temperature
environment, [crew members become easily fatigued.]{.underline} The
activity level of crew decreases significantly, and the perception and
response speed of external conditions also decrease (Sun, 2020; Zhang et
al., 2006).

[Under the effect of sea waves, rain, and snow, the ship [deck
and]{.mark} the outer [hull]{.mark} are easy to [accumulate
water]{.mark}]{.underline}. Affected by low-temperature conditions,
water on deck, hull and equipment will freeze quickly. If those
accumulated water is not treated in time and that will affect the
stability of the ship and cause the radar and other facilities to be
damaged, which will eventually cause safety risks. At the same time, the
toughness of steel and other materials also decreases at low
temperature. Under the influence of continuous low temperature during
the voyage, the equipment of the ship engine room and piping system
becomes extremely vulnerable (Ma, 2015). If no auxiliary heating
equipment or deicing equipment is equipped, the [[maintenance
cost]{.mark} of the ship's equipment will [increase]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}. [The toughness of a ship's hull also
decreases as the temperature drops. Therefore, when a ship collides at
low temperatures, the [danger and hazards are]{.mark} dramatically
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2023a).

In terms of cargo ships, which own the largest proportion of ships
navigate in Arctic shipping routes, some types of cargo are difficult to
store or transport at low temperature. Consequently, cargo ships should
consider the types of cargo to be transported in advance to avoid
economic losses when choosing Arctic shipping routes.

[Sea ice factors]{.underline}

Affected by the low temperature, the sea [ice concentration and
thickness in the Arctic Ocean are high]{.underline}. [[When ships
navigate in]{.mark} the highly concentrated [sea ice]{.mark}
area]{.underline}, the [ships' sailing [speed reduces]{.mark}
significantly [and]{.mark} the [maneuvering]{.mark} performance is
[decreased]{.mark}]{.underline} (Buysse, 2007). Additionally, under the
influence of strong winds and currents, the [[dangers posed by
floating]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark} to ship navigation [are]{.mark}
further [increased]{.mark} and the sea ice becomes one of the biggest
disturbing factors for ships sailing in the Arctic shipping
routes]{.underline} (Li et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022).
[Collisions]{.underline} between ships and sea ice [are]{.underline} one
of the most [important]{.underline} accidents in Arctic shipping routes
(Fu et al., 2021). It is generally recognized that general ships can
safely pass through according to the original calculation when the
concentration of sea ice in the shipping routes is less than 30% and the
thickness of sea ice is less than 30cm (Zhang, 2016). In the area with
high concentrations and thickness of sea ice, [low ice class ships are
prone to ice trap accidents]{.underline}. [[Even when sailing
under]{.mark} the escort of [icebreakers]{.mark}, there are still in
danger of accidents such as enclosure by sea ice on both sides of the
secondary shipping routes, grounding, damage to the hull by squeezing,
or damage to the propeller by inhalation of broken ice while
astern]{.underline}.

When the ship is trapped by sea ice, the steering ability becomes worse
and it is easy to move with the floating ice and cause the ship
grounding. At the same time, sea ice on either side of a ship can crush
the fragile sides, causing [hull damage]{.underline} (Bai et al., 2022;
Zhang et al., 2023b). Sea [[ice]{.underline}]{.mark} [can]{.underline}
also [[block navigation]{.mark} signs]{.underline} and cause hull
tremors, which can [greatly affect shipping navigation.]{.underline} In
addition, it also leads to [severe disruption of ships' transit
schedules and causes economic loss]{.underline} (Turnbull et al. 2019).
In order to assess the navigation risks of ships under different sea ice
conditions, the Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System
(POLARIS) was proposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
in 2016 to assess the navigational risks of ships in all kinds of ice
conditions.

POLARIS introduced the risk value index (RV) to assess the risk of ship
navigation in the sea ice cover area. The ship navigation risk index RV
is determined by the ship\'s ice resistance and sea ice type, its value
ranges from −6 to 3. If RV is negative, the navigation risk of the ship
is higher, which means it is not suitable for navigation and the smaller
the value, the higher the navigation risk is. When RV is positive, the
navigation risk is lower and the larger the value is, the higher the
navigation safety is.

POLARIS divides ships into three categories based on their ice-breaking
capacity, called Class A, B, and C. Among them, Class A ships meet the
ice-breaking capacity under relatively severe ice conditions, and the
ice-breaking thickness is generally over 70cm. Class B ships refer to
those ships that can sail independently in thin ice (typical thickness
of approximately 30cm), and the design standard is not lower than the
safety design standard of PC7 class icebreaker of the International
Shipping Society; Class C ships cover other ships that can operate
within polar waters. Ships of this class can only sail in open waters or
under extremely thin sea ice cover conditions and mainly include ships
of the Finnish-Swedish classifcation types 1A Super, 1A, 1B, IC, and
general merchant ships. RV values under diferent sea ice thicknesses are
shown in Table 4. Combined with the RV value and regional sea ice
concentration, the comprehensive navigation risk calculation method is
shown in Equation 1. RIOV = (1) ∑CT × RVV,T

Among them, RIOV is a comprehensive navigation risk index; CT is the
concentration of type T sea ice in the channel; RVV,T is the RV value
for a Type V ship under Type T sea ice. According to the comprehensive
navigation risk index, ship operations can be divided into normal
operation, elevated operation risk, and operation subject to special
consideration. Table 5 shows the ship operations under diferent risk
indices. Icebreaker escort is generally required when the risk index is
negative and the RIO result under escort can be recognized as the
original RIO result plus 10. If ships are of elevated operation risk,
the recommended speed is shown in Table 6.

[Poor visibility factors]{.underline}

The [**[frequency of]{.mark}** advection **[fog]{.mark}** in the Arctic
Ocean in summer **[is]{.mark}** extremely
**[high]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so Arctic [shipping routes are usually
covered by sea fog and ships often have poor visibility
effects]{.underline}. Stratospheric fog in the Arctic region is
characterized by a [fast appearance and long duration.]{.underline}
Moreover, the Arctic region is covered by a large amount of sea ice and
snow; the [crew is prone to [snow blindness]{.mark} which
[affects]{.mark} the [perception]{.mark} and judgment ability of the
surrounding situation and the risk of major accidents increases
significantly]{.underline} (Goerlandt et al., 2017). Additionally,
[visibility deteriorates further under the influence of polar nights
caused by high latitudes.]{.underline} Studies have shown that ship
navigation has potential safety hazards when the visibility is less than
4km. When it is lower than 1km, the probability of accidents increases
significantly (Lv, 2012). Affected by various factors, sometimes the
visibility of ships on the Arctic shipping routes is even lower than 100
meters, which seriously affects the safe navigation of ships.

[Communication factors]{.underline}

[Ship communication failures are one of the leading causes of ship
collisions in Arctic shipping routes]{.underline} (Fu et al., 2021; Xu
et al., 2022). The [Arctic region is affected by the high latitude
effect and harsh environment; as a result, the **[accuracy and
timeliness of equipment]{.mark}** such as magnetic compass longitude
**[is]{.mark}** greatly **[reduced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[coverage of]{.mark} polar [communication and]{.mark} meteorological
[data collection]{.mark} facilities [is]{.mark} also
[low]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [under low temperatures, mobile
data collection equipment such as drones is restricted in their work and
data collection measures are limited]{.underline} (Ma et al., 2022).
Accompanied by the fact that the ice foe is constantly moving under the
influence of wind, [it is difficult for ships to communicate, perceive,
and predict the surrounding environment in real-time, which affects ship
navigation significantly]{.underline} (Zhong, 2013; Zhu et al., 2015b).

[Lack of infrastructure]{.underline}

The [**transport and [logistics infrastructure]{.mark} in the Arctic
shipping routes [is underdeveloped]{.mark}** and the digitization of
basic services required for safe navigation in difficult conditions is
insufficient]{.underline} (Vicentiy, 2021). When ships navigate in the
Arctic shipping routes, [it is difficult to get supplies from the
nearest port when ships are far inland.]{.underline} Moreover, due to
the harsh natural environment, [there are few ports and a lack of
infrastructure]{.underline} along the Arctic shipping routes,
[which]{.underline} further [increases]{.underline} the [difficulty of
obtaining supplies and rescue]{.underline} for ships. Therefore, the
[capability of search and rescue is low]{.underline} in the Arctic,
which means that the consequences of ship (especially for oil tankers)
accidents resulting in oil spills may be very serious (Afenyo et al.,
2019; Kujala et al., 2019; Nevalainen et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021).

[Lack of navigation experience]{.underline}

According to statistics on Arctic shipping routes accidents, about [75%
of accidents are caused by humans]{.underline}. In general, the number
of ships currently navigating in the Arctic shipping routes is lower
than in traditional shipping routes. [Since]{.underline} most of the
[[crew]{.underline}]{.mark} members [[lack experience]{.mark} in
navigating the Arctic shipping routes]{.underline}, the [possibility of
accidents under complex operations increases]{.underline}. Therefore,
crew training should be strengthened and experienced crew members need
to be screened before Arctic navigation in order to reduce the risk of
accidents (Boström et al., 2017; IMO, 2014; Xu et al., 2022).

[Lack of historical data]{.underline}

Large amounts of historical data are one of the key foundations for
conducting research in the field of transport (Chen et al., 2020). As a
shipping route that is still in the exploration period, the [historical
data]{.underline} of ships navigating in Arctic shipping routes
currently preserved is not enough and [is scattered]{.underline} in
different routes (Xu et al., 2021), and there are few studies related to
the analysis of navigation environment and traffic simulation of Arctic
shipping routes using ship navigation big data (Ma, 2013).

[[High risk of collision]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [collision between icebreakers and escorted ships is the most common
accident in polar ship formation navigation]{.underline} (Goerland et
al., 2016; Nevalainen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017), [which can
[lead to]{.mark} injuries and human [casualties]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Kum et al.,. 2015). Therefore, reasonable ship spacing should be
selected to avoid the collision risk of ship formation. The distance
between ships in formation is determined by the captain of the
icebreaker. When ships sailing with the icebreaker, a large distance
between ships should be adopted to avoid the risk of ship collision in
an emergency, and a small distance between ships should be adopted to
avoid the secondary shipping routes opened by the icebreaker being
covered by sea ice again and eventually causing ice trap. Comprehensive
analysis of the risk of collision between ships and other ships and sea
ice to determine the safe following distance (Liu et al., 2023). The
[following distance of ships varies greatly under different ice
conditions.]{.underline} When ships sail in open waters, the distance
between ships is often kept several hundred meters to avoid collision.
[In some waters with high sea ice pressure, the secondary shipping
routes opened by icebreakers will be re-covered by squeezed sea ice in a
short time, and the [sailing distance]{.mark} of ship formation is only
a few meters]{.underline} (Li et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2020; Wu, 2016;
Xuan et al., 2014), [significantly [increased risk]{.mark} of
collision.]{.underline}

[Complex navigation condition]{.underline}

[In some water areas of the Arctic shipping routes (especially the
Northwest Passage), the [topography]{.mark} of the route [is
complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [width is narrow, and the water
depth is shallow due to the interference of sea ice]{.underline}, and
[ships need to turn or adjust speed several times to prevent collision
or ice trapping]{.underline}. [[Due to]{.mark} the [shallow]{.mark}
water effect [and bank effect]{.mark}, and the difficulty of ship
operation when navigating in ice areas]{.underline}, [[accidents
are]{.mark} very [likely]{.mark} to happen]{.underline}. Besides,
navigating in the ice-covered area sometimes requires frequent rudder
operation so the crew has to analyze various hydrometeorological
information in time and look for the passage between the ice, which
causes a [great labor intensity and pressure]{.underline}. In polar
voyage, the work should be timely adjusted according to the status of
the crew, so as to reduce the influence of crew fatigue on the
operational level of the ship.

[Other factors]{.underline}

The opening period of the Arctic shipping route is not fixed due to the
influence of meteorological conditions such as temperature in different
years. Therefore, the proportion of general cargo ships, bulk carriers,
and other ships in the Arctic shipping routes is large. [[Container
ships]{.underline}]{.mark} have higher requirements on shipping dates
and timeliness of delivery of goods, so those kinds of ships [[have
fewer navigation advantages in choosing the Arctic]{.mark} shipping
routes.]{.underline}

The cost of ocean voyage in Arctic shipping routes

The cost of an ocean voyage mainly includes fuel cost, marine insurance
cost, ship depreciation cost, staff salary cost, and other costs (shown
in Fig. 8). [[Compared with other routes]{.mark}, the **[Arctic
shipping]{.mark} routes** may also **[incur additional costs]{.mark}**
such as pilotage cost, icebreaker escort cist, and sea ice situation
forecast cost]{.underline} (Zhang et al., 2009).

(1) [Fuel cost]{.underline}

Fuel cost is the most important factor that affect shipping costs,
accounting for about half of the total shipping cost (Chen et al. 2022;
Fei et al. 2020; Liu, 2008). Fuel costs are mainly related to mileage
and fuel prices. According to the statistical report, each \$1 increase
in fuel prices increases shipping costs by an average of 1%. Based on
the fuel cost advantage, the Arctic shipping routes are typically more
than 25% cheaper than traditional shipping routes, and the higher the
price of oil, the more pronounced the advantage of the Arctic shipping
routes.

(2) [Marine insurance cost]{.underline}

Marine insurance cost generally accounts for 1%\~3% of the total cost of
freight value, including Marine risk protection insurance and external
risk insurance costs. On the traditional ocean routes between China and
Europe, piracy activities are frequent through the Strait of Malacca and
Somali shipping routes and the insurance cost is super high. The
insurance cost related to piracy prevention alone accounts for
0.125%\~0.2% of the total cost of cargo value (Li, 2009). The adoption
of the Arctic shipping routes has a lower probability of piracy and
other risks due to the poor sea ice condition and low temperature; as a
result, the insurance cost is lower than the traditional route.

(3) [Ship depreciation cost]{.underline}

[[Seaworthy ships on the Arctic]{.mark} shipping routes [need to be
equipped with additional capabilities]{.mark} such as ice resistance,
[and the **cost of the ships is much higher**]{.mark} than that of
general cargo ships]{.underline}. The [cost of Arctic ships with similar
magnitude is **[more than 20%]{.mark} higher** [than]{.mark} that of
[traditional]{.mark} ocean-going [cargo ships]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
the same time, due to the influence of low temperature, sea ice, or
other factors, the [[wear and consumption]{.mark} of ships in the Arctic
shipping routes are [accelerated, so]{.mark} the [depreciation and
maintenance costs]{.mark} of ships [are higher]{.mark} than those of
other ships, accounting for 14.7% of the shipping cost
approximately]{.underline} (Zhu, 2007). With the increasing temperature
in the Arctic and the melting of sea ice, the navigation conditions in
Arctic shipping routes are improving year by year. In the future, the
depreciation cost of ships operating in the Arctic shipping routes will
be reduced and eventually approach the traditional shipping routes.

(4) Staff salary cost

Staff salary accounts for about 5.3% of the total maritime
transportation cost (Zhu, 2007), which is mainly related to personnel
salary and voyage date. The distance of the Arctic shipping routes is
20\~50% lower than that of the traditional shipping routes, with the
shipping schedule of different routes being shortened by 3\~14.5 days on
average. Meanwhile, the queuing time of the Arctic shipping routes is
much lower than that of the traditional shipping routes, and the
shipping schedule is further shortened. Staff salaries and
administrative costs are reduced by 1.6%\~2.7% on average.

(5) Other cost

Currently, the Arctic shipping routes are not limited by tonnage, which
makes it ideal for mega-ships and superjumbos to navigate. As the
transport cost per unit mass of large tonnage ships is lower than that
of small tonnage ships, the average freight cost of ships in the Arctic
shipping routes is lower than that of traditional shipping routes. [Due
to the influence of sea ice, [some]{.mark} ships [need]{.mark} to be
assisted by pilotage or [icebreaker escorts]{.mark} when crossing Arctic
shipping routes. Furthermore, [it is difficult]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
rescue or [deal with accidents]{.mark} in the Arctic shipping routes and
[resulting in additional]{.mark} navigation [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 1NC \-- AT: Arctic War

#### The Arctic is stable and politically insulated from warming

-- DOA: 6/7/25, MoState JG

What could lead to a serious conflict in the Arctic? A story from nearly
20 years ago might provide some clues. It was a cold autumn and the sea
was rough. Norwegian Coast Guard inspectors were on duty and were far
out to sea, about to board the Russian trawler Electron, as they had
noticed the vessel was not abiding by protocols. What followed next put
Norwegian diplomacy to the test. The Russian fishermen took the
Norwegian inspectors into Russian waters, and were pursued by Norwegian
Coast Guard ships and helicopters. It later emerged that the Norwegian
Naval Special Operations Command had also been mobilised. Could have
ended differently today After delicate diplomatic efforts, Norway
managed to get the Russian authorities to instruct the trawler to
release the Norwegians and hand over Electron's vessel documents. The
Coast Guard is part of the Norwegian defence. To avoid escalating the
conflict, it was crucial that the Russian Northern Fleet was kept out of
the area. "The Electron incident occurred in 2005. If this had happened
in 2024, it\'s not certain it would have ended as well," Andreas
Østhagen says. He is a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute (FNI). He studies Arctic geopolitics, seeking to identify
factors that could lead to dangerous security flare ups in the Arctic.
Everything that could have gone wrong "When thinking about potential
conflict in the North, it\'s precisely a scenario like the Electron case
that could spiral out of control," Østhagen says. What would have
happened if the fishery inspectors were armed? What if the weather had
been good enough for the marines to board the ship? What if the admirals
of the Russian Northern Fleet were not interested in de-escalation? Many
things could have gone wrong, contributing to an escalation of the
conflict rather than keeping the tumult at as low a level as possible.
Østhagen envisions two scenarios for conflict in the North: A low-scale
incident that escalates or a full-blown crisis, which, in that case,
would be linked to something much larger than the Arctic where Russia
plays a key role. He references the situation in Ukraine and the
currenty global instability. "There is no doubt that interest in the
Arctic is increasing, both commercially and in terms of a geopolitical
power play," he says. Geopolitics deals with how a country\'s politics,
history, and society are shaped based on its geography.

**[The situation is calmer than expected]{.underline}** But Østhagen
believes there are three major misconceptions about geopolitics in the
Arctic: The first is the possibility of war in the Arctic. The second is
that there are unresolved borders in the Arctic and that a resource race
is underway. The third is that climate change is the primary catalyst
for all changes in the Arctic region. "The [reality is much
calmer]{.underline}," Østhagen says. "The [Electron case illustrates
well everything that can go wrong. But it also shows why]{.underline}
**[[things usually don't go wrong. There\'s a willingness to
cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Svein Vigeland Rottem says. [He is a
senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Rottem and Østhagen do not agree that the Arctic is
a powder keg and a dangerous place, as recently stated by Lars Saunes,
former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation
NRK. [Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic]{.underline}
Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions in the Arctic are]{.mark} often more
[stable and transparent]{.mark} than many assume]{.underline}.
[**[Conflict is not easily triggered]{.underline}**,
[considering]{.underline}]{.mark} [the vast areas and diverse countries
involved]{.underline}. Østhagen emphasises the **[[enormity of the
Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which [encompasses eight countries, four
million people, and extensive ocean areas. The countries include Russia,
the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.]{.underline} He notes that the
[significant Russian presence]{.underline} -- with almost half of the
Arctic landmass under Russian control -- [influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North]{.underline}. [Iver B. Neumann, a Russia
researcher and director at the FNI, concurs that **the Arctic is [less
likely to witness]{.mark} armed [conflict than other]{.mark} global
[locations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} He believes the primary driver for
military conflict in the Arctic is Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base
for nuclear weapons. "There are three main ways to keep such weapons
mobile: in aircraft, on land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where
such submarines exist, as in Murmansk, there is also significant
military attention. And where there is military attention, there is also
the potential for conflict," he says. Neumann advises caution in
responding to Russia\'s desire for global attention and military
control, stressing the importance of Norway maintaining a cool head,
enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to intimidation. [Myth 2:
Unresolved borders and a race for resources]{.underline} As the Arctic
becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of climate
change, [a common myth suggests a scramble for resources and land in the
North will occur]{.underline}. But Østhagen clarifies that, [unlike in
other parts of the world, [there are almost **no disputes over Arctic
borders**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "All the borders are settled," he
says, noting that [the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was
resolved in 2022.]{.underline} [[Maritime boundaries are key]{.mark} for
resource management and potential conflict]{.underline}. Law of the sea
grants coastal states sovereign rights for resource exploitation in
their economic zones. In the Arctic, [[only one]{.mark} maritime
boundary [remains unresolved]{.mark}. It is [between the USA and
Canada]{.mark} -- two [close allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Østhagen, who
wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, foresees [**no major concerns**
regarding]{.mark} sovereignty or [territorial
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. He believes the [myth persists due to
historical reasons but]{.underline} emphasises that, with all the land
borders settled and just one disputed sea border, [**[Arctic resources
are already distributed]{.mark}** among the eight Arctic
states.]{.underline} [Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the
Arctic [A]{.mark} third [myth suggests]{.mark} that [climate change is
the]{.mark} main [driver]{.mark} for all political shifts in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [But Østhagen **[caution]{.mark}**s [against
oversimplifying]{.mark} the issue]{.underline}, noting that while
climate change does affect fish migration -- leading to potential future
conflicts around resource-rich areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to
be specific about which aspects of climate change increase conflict
risks. Another claim Østhagen addresses is [the notion that Russia's
military buildup in the Arctic is climate change-driven]{.underline}. He
suggests that this [is only partially true]{.underline}, as Russia is
generally strengthening its military. The Arctic, traditionally seen as
secure due to inaccessibility and ice cover, hosts many of Russia's
nuclear weapons. "Putin's aim to rebuild Russia as a military
superpower, with credible nuclear deterrence, involves deploying weapons
to strategic locations like the Kola Peninsula," Østhagen says. With
climate changes, increased shipping activity in Russian Arctic waters
becomes more feasible. "Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that
Russia wants to maintain control over its northern territories," the
researcher says. However, according to Østhagen, [[Russia's military
buildup]{.mark} in the region [is more about]{.mark} relations with
[NATO than]{.mark} the changing [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Norway defines the Arctic as the areas between the Arctic Circle and the
North Pole. Although the region has remained stable for a long time,
[[the most recent Norwegian]{.underline}]{.mark} government Arctic
[[Policy]{.underline}]{.mark} \[59\] clearly [[states that Russian
military activity is a threat and that Norway relies on a strong NATO
presence in the area.]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic issues are at the core
of the country\'s foreign policy; almost half a million of its citizens
live in the area. Although it is not densely populated, it covers a
[[third of Norway\'s territory]{.underline}]{.mark} and most of its
maritime exclusive economic zone. It is also rather well integrated with
the rest of the country in practice \[60\]. Officially, the most
commonly used term [[is "High North]{.underline}]{.mark}", which comes
from the Norwegian word nordområdene (officially "the northern regions",
but in English "High North" is mostly used to refer to northern areas in
connection to foreign policy and international relations, especially
Svalbard, and the states around the Barents Sea). Russian relations are
an important factor in this context \[61\]. The politically loaded term
'High North' is connected to "efforts to safeguard Norwegian interests
through various initiatives and cross-border cooperation in the North
Calotte region and the Barents region as a whole" \[59\]. Interest in
developing a more robust Arctic policy has grown in recent years in
Norway because of climate change, which allows more activity in the
polar areas, technological development and increasing commercial
activity \[62\]. At the same time, [[there is no "scramble for the
Arctic", despite the media claims]{.underline}]{.mark} \[63\]. [[The
area has been characterised by political stability and well-functioning
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} \[62\].

The Arctic Ocean may be the world's smallest but it looms large in the
imagination. Remote and unique, the Arctic is, for some at least, the
most romanticized ocean in the world. It has been fueling legends and
ambitions for centuries, and continues to fuel new geopolitical myths
today.

[Global dynamics, from climate change to the decline of American
hegemony and tech]{.underline}nological revolution, [are reshaping the
Arctic.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [mythmaking about the Arctic
continues to distort the narratives available to both public and elite
audiences.]{.underline} Heather Exner-Pirot beautifully explains how
easy this can be and, as Josh Tallis has written, the phantom of Arctic
misgovernance can be used to raise alarm about an unusual gap in Arctic
security governance. In reality, though, the Arctic is profoundly
normal.

The following is an effort to disassemble the leading myths about the
Arctic Ocean and to underscore nuggets of truth underlying the legends.
The natural tendency, noted above, for people to process their
understanding of the Arctic through the most dramatic filter possible,
is not easy to counteract by listing mundane realities. But falling for
the hype is not a good way to make policy. Refuting these myths can put
the focus back on more mundane, but ultimately more valuable, solutions.

The Legendary Arctic Scramble

Most of the [modern Arctic myths and legends are spicing up mundane
realities with added drama]{.underline}. For example, it's [common to
see the Arctic referred to as a battleground for valuable natural
resources.]{.underline} It's the "\$1 Trillion Ocean", [holding massive
reserves of oil and gas]{.underline} (or one trillion dollars' worth of
critical minerals, take your pick), [with echoes of Dr. Evil.
Competition over resources is framed as a "race" or "battle," although
it is often unclear what winning might mean.]{.underline} Industry and
science have long known that the Arctic holds a significant endowment of
natural resources. **[Prospecting and [development in the Arctic lag
behind]{.mark} that of [other]{.mark} [regions due to]{.mark} the
significant [logistical challenges and]{.mark} resulting [extra
costs]{.mark} relating to arctic operations]{.underline}**. [[Resource
deposits]{.mark} in the Arctic [must be of a higher grade or size to
attract investors and overcome]{.mark} the added [risk]{.mark} to
capital.]{.underline} In short, [it has historically been [cheaper to
look elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} And that largely remains true:
[[There has not been a flood of]{.mark} investment and new
[development]{.mark} into the Arctic.]{.underline}

Rather than unclaimed, ungoverned space, the Arctic Ocean and
surrounding landmass are almost entirely sovereign lands and waters of
the eight Arctic states. Yes, there is a small area of high seas, the
central Arctic Ocean. This area is under a fishing moratorium and can
only be accessed through traversing an Arctic state's waters (plus
likely stopping in an Arctic state port). And yet [the myth of an Arctic
wild west persists:]{.underline} "As a consequence of the rapidly
disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an [[increase in
unclaimed]{.mark} ocean and land [territory]{.mark}, beyond any nation's
control, that [countries]{.mark} are **[attempt]{.mark}**ing [to
claim]{.mark} jurisdiction over]{.underline}," proclaims one analysis.
[While this is a common argument, it [is **factually
incorrect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [is linking two separate issues
into one misleading causal chain: the decline in Arctic sea ice due to
climate change, and the ongoing process of defining boundaries and
spaces under international law.]{.underline} In fact, **[[there is no
unclaimed]{.underline}]{.mark}** land **[[territory in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [there is just one maritime boundary
disagreement, between the United States and Canada, over a tiny slice of
the Beaufort Sea]{.underline}.

Perhaps the "Great Arctic Race" is about the [[overlapping
claims]{.underline}]{.mark} to the central Arctic Ocean seabed. The U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) permits coastal states to
claim areas of the extended continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical
mile exclusive economic zone, if they can prove that these areas are a
natural prolongation of their continental shelf. Russia, Denmark (via
Greenland), and Canada have overlapping claims in the central Arctic.
Thus far, they [have]{.underline} [all [adhered to]{.mark} the process
of defining these claims in accordance with **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Russia's law-abiding approach to the
Arctic shelf claims is a rare bright spot in the country's foreign
policy.]{.underline}**

The U.N. convention and seabed claims have been in the spotlight
recently as interest grows in seabed mining for critical minerals.
[Seabed [mining is not likely to drive conflict]{.mark} over Arctic
shelf claims]{.underline}. The [central [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
Ocean --- over 200 nautical miles from any coast --- [[is]{.mark} also
an incredibly [inhospitable]{.mark} area for resource
extraction]{.underline}. The Arctic Ocean still freezes in the winter,
and is sunk in the frigid darkness of the polar night. The [seabed
mining]{.underline} industry, like most global industry, [is likely to
look for less costly options in warmer latitudes]{.underline}. While it
cannot be assumed that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} will continue
pursuing its shelf claims in accordance with international law, it [is
likely to [use]{.mark} lower-cost [tools like lawfare
or]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation [warfare
[to complicate]{.mark} central [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [claims]{.mark},
[rather than]{.mark} apply high-cost and hard-to-sustain
[military]{.mark} options]{.underline}.

**[The [Myth of]{.mark} Increasing Accessibility and Arctic
[Shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [idea that climate change is increasing accessibility in the Arctic
is repeated so often that it is taken for granted]{.underline}. There is
an element of truth here --- the thick cap of multiyear Arctic sea ice
that has shaped the region for thousands of years is
[melting]{.underline} away and will soon be gone. But that [is just one
piece of a bigger puzzle]{.underline}, and the net [effect of
**[climate]{.mark} change in the Arctic [is making]{.mark} human
[activity harder, not easier]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Shrinking]{.mark} sea [ice]{.mark} leaves coastlines [unprotected
from]{.mark} stronger, more frequent [storms]{.mark}. Coastal erosion is
higher in the Arctic than anywhere else, threatening U.S. radar
installations]{.underline}. [[Thawing]{.mark} permafrost causes
subsidence, [destroying infrastructure]{.mark} and saddling Arctic
states with massive costs]{.underline} --- highest in Russia. Permafrost
thaw will cause many more disasters in coming years, in Russia and
elsewhere. Massive [[wildfires]{.mark} further [endanger]{.mark}
communities and infrastructure in [the North]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
sea, increased storminess and stronger waves create hazards, along with
increases in drifting ice. [At the heart of it all lies
[uncertainty]{.mark} --- [a]{.mark} powerful [dissuading
factor.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Arctic shipping lanes replacing Suez and Panama is another related
myth]{.underline}. When crisis erupts in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, or
the Panama Canal, it is tempting to point north to emerging Arctic
shipping lanes as alternatives. [[On paper, Arctic shipping]{.mark}
routes appear to [offer]{.mark} considerable [savings]{.mark} of
distance, time, and fuel between northern ports in Asia, Europe, and
North America.]{.underline} However, **[[in practice,]{.mark} these
shipping [routes remain]{.mark} largely
[notional]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Over the last decade, [destinational
Arctic maritime activity has ticked up,]{.underline} mostly driven by
Russia's Yamal liquified natural gas project and expansion at Canada's
Mary River Mine. Container ships and roll-on roll-offs are barely
present, and this type of traffic has showed no change in the past
decade.

It is clear that [Canada has no interest in opening the Northwest
Passage]{.underline} to international shipping. Furthermore, the
[[complex routes]{.underline}]{.mark} of the passage [[have]{.mark}
draft [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}, significant [remaining ice,
[and inadequate charting]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} [has been personally
driving the effort to develop the Northern Sea Route]{.underline},
imposing an ambitious timeline for cargo growth, [reality is not keeping
pace]{.underline}. The [route is plagued by its own draft limitations
and lack of supporting infrastructure, as well as unpredictable ice
hazards.]{.underline} International [shipping vanished following the
2022 invasion of Ukraine, and while cargo totals have rebounded and
grown in the past two years, the **[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute [is functionally]{.mark} a route [for]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark}-flagged [ships]{.mark} of all sorts to carry oil and
gas to Asian markets]{.underline} (and bring in construction materials
for future developments, which have been weakened by sanctions).

The Myth of Russian Dominance and American Indifference

A large body of [mythmaking threatens to create a security
crisis]{.underline} in the Arctic [by sketching a 10-foot-tall Russia
intent on conquering the region]{.underline} and controlling the ocean
and casting the United States as an impotent weakling. These [outsize
legends are used to justify massive **spending increases in the
Arctic**,]{.underline} as well as significantly stronger measures
against Russia, both of which could **[contribute to
escalation]{.underline}** in the region [and also ripple across the
global balance]{.underline}.

[Russia's so-called "dominance" of the Arctic has been treated as
gospel.]{.underline} It is true that over half of the Arctic coastline
is Russian territory, and nearly half of the people living in the Arctic
live in Russia. And yet the discourse of Russian dominance in the Arctic
goes beyond geography. It also presents Russia's position as a threat to
the United States and to the entire Arctic Ocean. Of course, Moscow does
everything it can to nourish this sense of threat. Planting a flag at
the seabed of the North Pole --- possibly the most effective Russian
public relations stunt ever --- was a purely symbolic act, but continues
to serve as a reference point. Dropping paratroopers at the North Pole,
or unfurling a giant banner on the ice, are also gestures that feed the
legend.

[Arguments about Russia's so-called dominance of the Arctic reveal more
about America's own insecurities than the facts on the
ground]{.underline}. This framing creates a sense of unnecessary urgency
and relies on a set of measures that together would badly warp U.S.
strategic planning. Part of this is [the]{.underline} [legendary
**[icebreaker gap,]{.mark} thoroughly [debunked]{.mark}** by Paul Avey.
Does Russia dominate the Arctic with its icebreakers? Or does it just
have [a reasonable number]{.mark} of icebreakers [for its]{.mark} 24,000
kilometer Arctic [coastline]{.mark}, along which Putin is desperately
thirsting to build an international shipping lane that has so far failed
to catch on?]{.underline} [Sober analyses of Russia's power and strategy
in the Arctic need to be facts-based, rather than dealing in terms of
dominance.]{.underline}

Yes, [[Russian military]{.underline}]{.mark} [capabilities and
capacities [in the Arctic are]{.mark} substantive]{.underline}. It is
widely recognized that Russian leadership began to rebuild and expand
Arctic military capabilities and capacities as soon as it was able to,
starting in the early 2000s. [Most authoritative analyses note that
these installations and systems are primarily [defensive]{.mark} in
nature,]{.underline} [intended to help control and protect Russia's
economic and strategic interests in the Arctic,]{.underline} although
they could of course be useful in supporting aggression and, as
Katarzyna Zysk notes, Russian strategic thinking does not clearly
differentiate between offence and defense. [All great powers have
military bases along their coastlines, and Russia has both strategic and
economic interests to protect in its Arctic territory.]{.underline}

And if fears over Russia are not enough[, another myth holds that China
is coming for the Arctic]{.underline}. [Or that Chinese-Russian
cooperation will open the door for Chinese dominance in the
Arctic]{.underline}. As Marc Lanteigne has explained[, **[relations
between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic are]{.mark}** far more
**[complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And others have noted that the
myth of China's growing influence in the Arctic is mostly serving
Beijing's interests. It is important to watch the broader trajectory of
Russian-Chinese relations and not rush to assumptions about China's
future in the Arctic.

In parts as a result of fears over Russian dominance, claims that the
U.S. Department of Defense "needs to do more in the Arctic" have also
become commonplace. The United States has identified several critical
gaps in operational capabilities and capacities in the Arctic, including
in the National Strategy for the Arctic Region as well as the Department
of Defense's Arctic strategy. The most significant gap is the North
Warning System, and the ongoing effort to replace this critical system.
Canada has also underscored its commitment to upgrade the key
continental defense architecture, most recently in an Arctic-focused
defense policy update. But it's also important to note that the United
States has significant Arctic military capabilities, including the
highest concentration of fifth-generation aircraft in the world, as well
as an airborne division in Alaska, along with a North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) region. U.S. Navy submarines operate and train
regularly in the Arctic Ocean.

In the current budget context, in which the Department of Defense faces
flat and tight budgets, there are not free-floating resources to build
up any but the most vital capabilities in the Arctic. Broad calls for
significant spending increases in the Arctic are divorced from the
reality of spending needs in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, and from U.S.
national strategic priorities.

Furthermore, this study has for the first time assessed [[Greenland's
potential to become a major e-fuel and e-chemical exporter
hub]{.underline}]{.mark}. Energy carriers can be produced [[at an
attractive cost]{.underline}]{.mark} of 81 €/MWhNH3 for eammonia and 124
€/MWhth for hydrocarbon e-fuels in 2030, mainly [[based on
wind]{.underline}]{.mark} electricity. In 2050, production costs of
energy carriers are at an acceptable level of 67 €/MWhNH3 and 106
€/MWhth, although other regions will likely reach even lower costs.
However, Greenland may still be an attractive supplier in diverse
portfolios and [[should be considered by policy
makers]{.underline}]{.mark} for future energy trading projects.

Previous studies have indicated that high volumes [[of e-fuels and
echemicals will be needed in the future to drive]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[defossilisation of]{.underline}]{.mark} segments of the
[[transport and industry]{.underline}]{.mark} sector. Greenland's rich

[[area]{.underline}]{.mark} availability, [[and close relations to
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} [[position]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[Greenland
as a potential e-fuels export hub]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, Greenland
may become an important and reliable partner [[of Europe, Japan, and

Climate change-driven temperature rise in the Arctic has been shown to
increase faster than on global average, heavily affecting Greenland's
environment. [[Greenland's energy]{.underline}]{.mark} system
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[vulnerable to oil
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it relies on imported oil. Rich
[[wind]{.underline}]{.mark} resources complementary
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [[solar]{.underline}]{.mark} resources [[may
enable a transition to a sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark} and
self-sufficient [[energy system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Greenland's
transition from a fossil fuels-based system to a 100% renewable energy
system between 2019 and 2050 [[and its]{.underline}]{.mark} position as
a pot[[ential e-fuels and e-chemicals production hub for Europe, Japan,
and South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}, has been investigated in this
study using the EnergyPLAN model. The results [[indicate a 25% reduction
in annualised costs for a fully renewable energy
system]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to the reference system. Importing
regions can benefit from some of the lowest-cost energy carriers in the
world in 2030, and these energy carriers will continue to have a
low-cost level in 2050. This study estimates that the production and
export of e-fuels and e-chemicals would require up to 300,000 workers
for construction and operations. [[Renewable energy enables a full
defossilisation of Greenland's energy system]{.underline}]{.mark},
enhances [[energy security]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} provides opportunities for additional

[[Fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} are the largest contributors to
climate change, [[account]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} around [[75% of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
total emissions of [[greenhouse gases]{.underline}]{.mark} \[9\],
dominated by carbon dioxide (CO2). [[A transition to a 100% renewable
global energy system has been shown to be a
cost-effective]{.underline}]{.mark} measure to drastically cut
greenhouse gas emissions and meet the global 1.5◦C climate target
\[10,11\]. The transition is already undergoing as countries have
announced their own 100% renewable targets for the power sector \[12\]
and solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power capacities are growing
rapidly year by year \[13\]. While the transition of the power sector is
straightforward, and direct electrification of some segments of
transport is undergoing with the uptake of battery electric vehicles
(BEV) \[14\], other sectors such as industry or long-range
transportation may have to rely on indirect electrification via
Power-to-X products \[15, 16\].

Studies have shown that [[many nations can meet their energy
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} for power, heat, transport, and industry
sectors [[with domestic]{.underline}]{.mark} renewable energy
([[RE]{.underline}]{.mark}) sources \[15\]. However, it may prove
significantly more costly [[in regions with less optimal renewable
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to importing energy from regions
with better resource availability. Possibilities for [[e-hydrogen
exports from Norway]{.underline}]{.mark} \[17\], e-methane from
Australia \[18\] and South America \[19\], e-Fischer-Tropsch liquids
(e-FTL) from Patagonia \[20\], e-ammonia from Australia \[21\], or
e-methanol from Saudi Arabia, Chile, and Australia \[22\] [[have been
considered]{.underline}]{.mark}. Several studies have compared costs and
efficiencies of importing several renewable electricity-based fuels
(e-fuels) \[23\] and renewable electricity-based chemicals (e-chemicals)
\[24,25\]. While most studies focus on Germany or another European
country as an importer, the exporter portfolio is more diverse. Most
studies focus on the Maghreb region \[26\] and North Africa \[25,27\],
the Middle East \[23\], South America \[20,23,24\], or Australia
\[18,21,28\]. The trading links between 92 regions of the world were
analysed for e-methane, e-FTL, e-ammonia, and e-methanol \[29\].
Sub-Saharan Africa and South America were identified as the largest
exporters of e-fuels and e-chemicals, whereas [[Europe, Eurasia, and
Northeast Asia emerge as the main importers. Trading can reduce the
cost]{.underline}]{.mark} of e-fuels and e-chemicals by up [[to 38% in
these regions]{.underline}]{.mark}, indicating substantial benefits of
e-fuels and e-chemicals trading in the future \[29\]. Most exporter
regions identified in the studies are regions with excellent solar and
wind resources. [[However, Greenland has not been
covered]{.underline}]{.mark} in literature [[despite having
exceptionally good wind conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} enabling
low-cost wind electricity generation \[30\], and as a consequence
low-cost e-fuels and e-chemicals as found on the case of e-ammonia
\[31\].

In addition to emissions reduction, the
[[defossilisation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the energy system as the
primary source of emissions [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} bring about other
benefits such as [[improve]{.underline}]{.mark}d air [[quality and
energy security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Greenland is an autonomous Danish
dependent territory with a population of 56,000 people and an area of
almost 2.2 million km2 \[32\] and a nominal gross domestic product of
55,000 USD per capita \[33\]. The island provides an intriguing case for
study owing to its severe climate with year-round low temperatures,
favourable wind conditions, and areas that experience polar night during
winter and polar day during summer with the sun shining continuously for
24 h. Furthermore, the country's power sector is already mostly
defossilised with more than 80% of the total electricity generated from
hydropower \[34\]. Together [[with low population density and high land
availability, these untapped resources present the opportunity to
**defossilise all energy sectors**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} may even [[enable e-fuels and
e-chemicals]{.underline}]{.mark} production [[for the global
market]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Greenland ehub hedges global energy markets against geopolitical risks

Despite a larger number of studies on the topic, [[Greenland
has]{.underline}]{.mark} been left out of the radars and no studies
exploring its potential as a fuel exporter were identified, except
numbers visualised in Fasihi et al. \[31\] on the case of e-ammonia.
However, [[excellent wind resources]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[can
offer low-cost renewable electricity]{.underline}]{.mark} \[30\] and a
vast availability of area may become important factors [[to consider
this location as a potential export hub]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this
research, the EnergyPLAN model has been utilised to offer a new
prospective on [[the Arctic region as a potential fuel production
hub]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[may help highly populated energy demand
centres]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet their climate goals. A connection
between Greenland and Europe through a sub-sea cable to export renewable
electricity has been previously considered \[87,88\]. One project has
been announced by H2Carrier and Anori to develop a 1.5 GW wind farm and
a floating green ammonia production vessel off the shore of Greenland
\[89\]. The idea of offshore synthetic fuel production on floating
islands has been introduced by Patterson et al. \[90\]. The present
study has shown that a large-scale production of e-fuels and e-chemicals
would be possible. e-Ammonia can be supplied at 81 €/MWhNH3 and 67
€/MWhNH3 in 2030 and 2050, respectively. Chances are high that e-fuels
business starts with e-ammonia, due to a lower complexity of its
production. e-Fuels and e-methanol can be supplied at 124 €/MWh and 106
€/MWh in the same periods. These costs are slightly higher than the
reported lowest e-ammonia production costs of 71 €/MWh and 53 €/MWh in
2030 and 2050 in the Atacama Desert, Horn of Africa, Yemen, and
southwest Niger \[31\]. Still, in 2030, [[e-ammonia can be produced in
Greenland for lower cost than in Europe, Japan, and South
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}. The costs of e-fuels and e-methanol are at a
comparable level with the best sites in 2030, but are at a slightly
higher cost level in 2050 \[29,91\]. e-FTL can be produced at 130--160
€/MWh in best locations such as Chile, Somalia, or Australia in 2030 and
at 70--75 €/MWh in 2050, while e-methanol production costs range from
102 to 127 €/MWh in 2030 and 49--57 at best locations \[29\]. Purchasing
energy carriers from Greenland even at slightly higher cost may still be
beneficial for Europe where domestic e-fuel production may be limited.
However, [[business relations with a country associated with
EU]{.underline}]{.mark} as opposed to non-EU countries [[can have a
significantly higher]{.underline}]{.mark} impact on [[energy security
and may hedge against geopolitical risks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Furthermore, even with lower production costs available in solar-rich
regions, imports from Greenland can help to diversify portfolios of
importers. North America has not been considered in this study as a
potential importer of e-fuels and e-chemicals from Greenland due to both
high land availability and high renewable resource potential for local
production. Furthermore, North America has been shown as a region with
almost no imports and small volumes of exports in 2030--2050 \[29\].

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} and the urgency of drastically
reducing greenhouse gas emissions [[necessitates rapid
defossilisation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the global energy system.
Regions in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} fast-warming
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} are already suffering from the
consequences of climate change and their high dependence on oil
amplifies their vulnerability to oil price volatility. Greenland, which
is highly dependent on imported oil and already experiences substantial
climate impacts, [[need]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[to transform its energy
system. This novel study has shown technically feasible and economically
viable full sector energy transition pathways towards a 100% renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} system.

This study has shown that excellent [[wind resources complemented by
solar]{.underline}]{.mark} photovoltaics during long summer days and
good hydropower resources [[can yield lower energy system
cost]{.underline}]{.mark}s for the residents, reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and meet power, heat, transport, and industry sectors'
demand. Total annualised costs of an energy system based on 100%
renewable energy [[providing self-sufficiency is projected to be 25%
lower compared to the reference system]{.underline}]{.mark}, leading to
a reduction from 86.0 €/MWh to 72.6 €/MWh per unit of final energy. The
[[annualised investment costs required will be much
higher]{.underline}]{.mark}, growing from 38 m€ to 114 m€ between 2019

According to the analysis [[pertaining to Norway, oil and gas production
is used to claim sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, hence, sovereignty as
a notion of security is [[delaying the energy
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, [[oil and gas provide
national wealth]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e. socio-economic security)
[[that finances]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not only military and
surveillance activity, but also the overall socio-economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic region, including
renewable energy production. This emphasises state as the main provider
of security, and the state\'s right to define security. Renewable energy
and sovereignty were not discussed in detail. However, previous research
on the Norwegian debate has shown that [[renewable energy developments
are not straightforwardly believed to be increasing sovereignty. The
opposite was found, especially in relation to Norway\'s
position]{.underline}]{.mark} to EU energy policy that was seen to
decrease sovereignty \[76\]. In the Finnish strategies, claims of
sovereignty are not as direct, although [[Finnish Lapland provides a
military training ground of strategic significance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In the interviews, [[connecting issues were the different views
on]{.underline}]{.mark} how to keep the land inhabited and by whom,
[[land use claims]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} measures by which the [[energy
transition]{.underline}]{.mark} could be governed [[under changing
landscape pressures, such as the war in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The emphasis was on negative security during the transition, with the
state operating as the primary authority on both the energy and defence
policy sectors.

Our main finding from the analysis supports the hypothesis, as the
[[development of]{.underline}]{.mark} the north in [[Norway is
**intimately connected** to continued oil and gas production and the
success of the Norwegian state, including financing the **military**
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has been present to the extent that
[[climate-related landscape pressures have **not** changed the
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} of policymaking. For Finland, this link
has not been so evident. Yet even though Finland does not have its own
oil and gas production, its Arctic policy until 2021 was partially
framed to support the fossil fuel industry with economic incentives.
[[This concept extends]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond Finland, resonating
within the broader Arctic context. The development potential [[across
the entire Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}, involving the Arctic 8
states and other interested parties, places significant importance on
oil and gas production. The major question is to which direction this
interest is steered to in relation to Arctic onshore and offshore wind,
mineral and metals. To that, Finland, and other Nordic states, have
possibilities to contribute to.

This connects to the second research question on [[what might hinder
energy transitions. We detected reservations from security policy
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} about trying out new forms of energy and
more sustainable practices. Whereas [[the Finnish]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategy documents did not discuss this issue at all, the interviews
revealed that the pressure for the transition was exerted at the
national level by indicating that the [[military uses the form of energy
that is currently available]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is particularly
interesting in Finland, where also [[large land areas of Lapland are
used for military exercises, and interest from allied countries to
practice in cold climates is expected to increase in the coming
years]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a broader context, however, the Arctic
does not stand out from the plans of Finland\'s Ministry of Defence to
participate in climate change adaptation \[77\], although details are
absent from the data. Climate security (impacts of climate crisis) also
did not appear in the data, despite future scenarios that are deemed
stark \[78\], especially for the Arctic region. One reason why climate
security was not explicitly discussed may be that the interviewees took
it as self-evident. Risks and threat scenarios related to Arctic climate
change may have been the reason they participated in the first place, so
they may not have felt the need to emphasise it.

EXPLORATION IN THE ARCTIC

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} has a long history of natural resource
extraction -- indeed, these industries are often a major presence in
remote regions. For example, the Dutch and British established whaling
stations and coal operations on Svalbard in 1610, cryolite extraction
began in Greenland in 1854 and the Klondike gold rush of Alaska and
Yukon began in 1898 (Boyd et al., 2016). [[Oil and gas
exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark} has also been and continues to be a
major industry in the Arctic, [[although largely offshore, bringing in
large amounts of revenue and resulting in significant environmental and
social conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nuttall, 2010). This article,
however, is primarily focused on the potential for critical mineral
resources onshore.

[[No signs]{.underline}]{.mark} yet [[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} the
bulk of [[Russia]{.mark}n [nuclear forces]{.mark} actually are
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[high alert]{.underline}]{.mark}** as part
of Moscow's "special regime of combat duty." But what's clear is that
Putin's televised order last week was designed to tell the United
States, NATO, and the West to desist from supporting Ukraine---or risk
unimaginable consequences. While Washington and its allies have been
right to avoid overreaction so far, Putin will likely continue his
nuclear saber-rattling, and there is still a risk that he would use
nuclear forces in Ukraine.

Although the announcement was an alarming development, it was also
foreseeable[. Nuclear signaling is a key part of Russia's military
strategy]{.underline} [and]{.underline} its [self-image]{.underline} as
a world power. That the Kremlin is now showing signs of implementing its
so-called escalate-to-deescalate strategy should come as no surprise to
those familiar with Russian doctrine. [The West must recognize this for
what it is]{.underline}: a form of [nuclear blackmail]{.underline} to
which the United States and its allies should not capitulate.

[For years]{.underline}, [Moscow]{.underline} has [made nuclear weapons
a centerpiece of]{.underline} its military [doctrine]{.underline}. In
the event of a major war, the Russian Federation has signaled its
willingness to threaten a "deescalatory" nuclear attack to achieve its
objectives. To that end, Putin has made it clear during crises that he
might threaten (or, in extreme cases, execute) an early nonstrategic
nuclear strike---hoping to end the confrontation on terms favorable to
the Kremlin.

Unlike the United States, Russia has signaled willingness to take this
step even if the crisis is of its own making. At the heart of this
strategy is Russia's arsenal of tactical, battlefield-ready nuclear
warheads. Even more concerning, these Russian weapons outnumber the
United States' arsenal of similar weapons by a magnitude of almost ten
to one.

Deterrence and dramatic moves

[[This level of]{.mark} nuclear [posturing has been visible in the
past]{.mark}]{.underline}. [During]{.underline} the
[[2014]{.underline}]{.mark} invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea,
[[Putin]{.mark} [bragged]{.mark}]{.underline} that [he wanted to remind
Russians]{.underline} (and, by extension, the West) that "[[Russia
is]{.mark} one of [the leading]{.mark} nuclear
[power]{.mark}s]{.underline}," and "it's best not to mess with us."
Although he never raised the nuclear alert, he later said he'd
considered doing so.

[Most likely]{.underline}, this [heightened]{.underline} state of
[readiness]{.underline}---just like Putin's explicit threats in his
pre-invasion speech and the recent exercises of Russia's strategic
forces---[is designed to deter NATO]{.underline} from direct
intervention in Ukraine. [Both [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [have [show]{.mark}n]{.underline}
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[desire to enter]{.mark} the
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} directly, and Putin's statement about a
Russian nuclear alert is designed to make sure it stays that way.

[[Putin]{.mark} issued nuclear threats because he has been [surprised
by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[strength]{.underline}]{.mark} and unity
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the US and NATO
[response]{.mark}]{.underline} [and [frustrated with
Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[slow]{.underline}]{.mark}er-than-expected [military
[advance]{.mark}]{.underline}. With these nuclear threats, he is trying
to sow divisions within the Alliance and get the White House to back
off. But [Western moves to assist Ukraine have been
dramatic]{.underline}. [Germany]{.underline} has [pledged to
increase]{.underline} its [defense spending]{.underline} by one hundred
billion euros and, despite a previous ban on shipments of arms to an
active war zone, Germany has, along with other [European Union
members]{.underline}, [announced weapons shipments]{.underline}. Even
[Turkey]{.underline}, which had previously shown reluctance to limit
Russian movement through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits,
[is]{.underline} now [willing to close]{.underline} the [passages
to]{.underline} some [Russian warships]{.underline}.

Putin might be betting that actions speak louder than words, and that a
nuclear alert could more effectively scare Western leaders into cutting
their support for Ukraine. Despite this nuclear blackmail, NATO should
continue to ~~stand~~ strong. [[Putin does]{.underline}]{.mark} [[not
want]{.mark} to fight a]{.underline} **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with the United States [any more
than]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates wants to fight a

superpower, and a [[nuclear exchange]{.mark} with the Pentagon would
[result in]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[unacceptable]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[consequences]{.mark} for Putin]{.underline}. Asked if the West should
worry about the possibility of a nuclear war, US President Joe Biden
answered with an intelligent and resolute, "no." [US Strategic
Command]{.underline} [echoed this]{.underline} sentiment, stating that
[the United States remains at]{.underline} an "[appropriate
posture]{.underline}" [to deter Russia]{.underline}.

Danger signs

Still, it's important to take these threats seriously. Typically,
Russia's tactical nuclear warheads are kept in centralized storage and
warheads are not deployed on strategic bombers. This enhanced readiness
alert could allow Russian forces to take steps such as mating their
warheads to their bombers or the short- and medium-range missiles that
have already been deployed close to the frontlines (such as the
short-range SS-26 ballistic missiles or the medium-range S-400 air
defense systems, both of which are dual-capable).

Last week's alert could also lead to some strategic delivery
systems---such as ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs) or mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)---being deployed or
dispersed. SSBNs, which are nuclear-powered, can be flushed out of port
into the open ocean; mobile ICBMs can drive away from their sheltered
garrisons and move around Russia's large landmass. Reports this week of
Russian exercises involving submarine and mobile ICBM deployments fit
this pattern. Still, these exercises are short of a full mobilization of
Russia's nuclear forces.

Game of chicken?

Yet [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the [incendiary
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} from Putin this weekend, [[Moscow has not
shown]{.mark} major [indications]{.mark} of moving in this
direction]{.underline}. On Monday, a senior US Department of Defense
official noted that there have not been any "noticeable muscle
movements" that would indicate a heightened combat readiness for
Russia's nuclear forces, and this week's exercises do not completely
change that picture. Though the United States and its allies should
continue to carefully monitor such measures, they should see these
threats for what they are---part of Putin's pattern, as White House
Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, of "manufacturing threats that don't
exist."

To be sure, if Putin finds himself in an increasingly desperate wartime
situation, he may consider the use of low-yield nuclear weapons on the
battlefield in Ukraine to reverse his losses. Washington should begin
developing a plan to deter this kind of attack in close consultation
with NATO allies.

But, at this early stage of the war, [[Putin's]{.mark} nuclear alert
is]{.underline} almost certainly **[[an elaborate
bluff]{.underline}]{.mark}** [meant to scare the United
States]{.underline} and its allies and partners. They should not give
him the satisfaction. Instead, the West should remain resolute in its
efforts to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.

insist the U.S. and NATO must militarily intervene in the war in
Ukraine. The head of the European Council on Foreign Relations openly
called for regime change in Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky called on NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea
former National Security Adviser John Bolton partially endorsed. A
no-fly zone, of course, would involve NATO aircraft shooting down
Russian warplanes over Ukrainian skies. [To [put]{.mark} it]{.underline}

[[The **German**]{.underline} [military]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} **[1940]{.underline}**, as its blitzkrieg swept across

**[[18 million]{.mark} Germans served]{.underline}** in uniform,
[approaching]{.underline} [**one-third of its total population**.

[At the start of the war, the Germans]{.underline} arguably [[had
the]{.underline} **[best tank]{.underline}**]{.mark} (the Panzer)
[[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[best [fighter]{.mark}]{.underline}**

German military was infamous---again, at the beginning of the war---for
its extraordinary training, discipline, and cohesion.]{.underline}

**[[None]{.mark} of that is [true of Russia]{.mark} or the Russian

**Shinkman 23'** -- Paul, Senior Writer of National Security at U.S.
News. "Putin's Hollow Nuclear Threat", U.S. News,

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Q: Is the U.S. effectively at war with Russia?]{.underline}
D\'Anieri**[: No. There is a big gap]{.underline}**, [well-understood on
all sides, between arming an ally and directly engaging with
Russia.]{.underline} There were many parallel examples during the Cold
War when the U.S. and Soviet Union (Russia) aided each other's enemies
without directly getting involved, and while this didn't always make the
other side happy, it was never seen as direct attack[. In fact, the
[U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n militaries have **for decades**]{.underline}
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [careful]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
avoid]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}ly [shooting]{.mark} at one
another,]{.underline} **[for fear of where it might end.]{.underline}**
Q: [Are we close to full-scale world war?]{.underline} D\'Anieri: [No.
The U.S. has **not attacked**]{.underline} [Russia and Russia has **not
attacked** the U.S., and neither of those things is **even remotely
likely at this point.**]{.underline} Q: [What is the price of
[Russian]{.mark} military [strikes]{.mark} on U.S. soil?]{.underline} Is
there a more likely course of Russian retaliation against the U.S.?
D\'Anieri: [Such an attack must be regarded as **[extremely
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If such an attack were to
take place, the [U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely seek to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a way that is
**proportional**]{.underline} [but **not escalatory.**]{.underline}
[[**Uncertainty** about]{.mark} what would lead to]{.underline}
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[why]{.mark} the [U.S. and Russia take]{.mark}]{.underline} **[such
[care]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} direct
[combat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as they **support competing
sides**]{.underline} in some conflicts. Russia has sought to intervene
in U.S. elections in the past, and likely will continue to do so. One
might also expect cyber attacks, but we have not seen them thus far in
this war. That suggests the [[Russians understand]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} **too [are vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also
quite likely that [with Russian forces already **overextended** fighting
against **Ukraine**, [Russian leaders realize]{.mark} that a [**second
major conflict** is not in their interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} Q:
Checking in at 14 months, how heavy is the cost of war for Russia, in
terms of the human toll and economics? Has Russia made resource and
allocation adjustments in the past months that will allow it to sustain
these losses? D\'Anieri: Russia's recent war efforts appear to be
unsustainable. They have lost large numbers of soldiers and expended
significant amounts of ammunition, such that commanders in the field are
complaining about shortages and are suggesting that they may soon have
to switch from offense to defense, which is less costly in terms of
people and materiel. Overall, the Russian economy is holding up. Growth
is very slow, and shortages of various imported goods are mounting, but
there are no signs that economic factors will severely constrain the war
effort any time soon. However, it would appear that [before the Russian
military could undertake **another large-scale offensive**]{.underline},
[a significant **program of recruitment**,]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}**, [and **re-arming**]{.underline} [would need
to take place]{.underline}. [It appears that [Russia **cannot
retake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the offensive]{.mark} in
2023.]{.underline}

secessionist groups in a portion of Ukraine's east were supported by
Russia.

The fear, in particular, is that Russia's successful expansion --
justified, it says, in part by the desire to protect persecuted ethnic
Russians in a neighboring land -- will cause, or tempt, it to expand
elsewhere reflecting the manner in which Hitler expanded in order, he
said, to protect ethnic Germans from persecution particularly in areas
to his east. Indeed, NATO planners busily check roads in Western Europe
to see if they are suitable for military transport in the event that
Russia launches a full-scale invasion of the continent.50 And in 2018,
at the badgering of President Donald Trump, NATO countries all agreed to
increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product
by 2024, something he implied was a triumph although it merely
reaffirmed a commitment they had made at the time of the Crimean
takeover in 2014. 51

In the settlement that led to the unification of Germany in 1990, the
United States verbally promised that, although East Germany would now
become part of a NATO country, there would be no further expansion of
the alliance to the east.52 A few years later, however, NATO began just
such an expansion very much against many agitated concerns by
specialists. Among these was George Kennan who warned that "the Russians
will react quite adversely" and called the policy "a tragic mistake,"
pointing out that "there was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was
threatening anyone else."53

The expansion was carried out with good intentions. and there were many
statements seeking to mollify Russian concerns including offering it a
sort of adjunct position in the alliance with the possible further
prospect of actual membership.54 Nevertheless, although the Russians
were powerless to stop the expansion, they greeted it with considerable
dismay and opposition, voiced not just by Communists and by
ultra-nationalists, but by very many in the Western-oriented elite. This
should have been a warning. But it wasn't. As Christopher Fettweis
observes, "In the 1990s, Russian protests regarding NATO expansion --
although nearly universal -- were not taken seriously, since U.S.
planners believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all."55

The situation was strained further in 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia, a
country with considerable historical links to Russia, securing the
secession of the Kosovo province as Russia stood by helplessly, a
development discussed in Chapter 3. Russia sometimes sees this as
precedent for its Crimean seizure.

As he was taking office as president of Russia in 2000, Vladimir Putin
did tell a British interviewer, "Russia is part of European culture and
I can't imagine my country cut off from what we often refer to as the
'civilized world'."56 However, the strains from NATO expansion and from
the Kosovo experience were already in place, and they gradually
escalated in the new century as Putin's regime became increasingly
autocratic and as the United States, and particularly Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, together with its West European allies issued strong
support for anti-Putin protests that took place in Russia in 2011--12.
57

Russia's concern about NATO enlargement focused especially on the
possible Westernization of Ukraine, the large new country to its west
that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. One American observer
who had served in the Obama administration supplies an arresting
parallel: "The United States would hardly sit by idly if Russia formed
an alliance with Mexico and Canada and started building military
installations along the US border."58

Unlike the neighboring countries to its west in what had previously been
known as "East Europe," Ukraine, although fairly open and democratic,
had become a basket case economically despite an enormous potential. A
few statistics may serve. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,
Ukraine's per capita GDP was higher than Poland's; 25 years later, it
was less than onethird that of Poland.59 In a study comparing 25
post-Communist countries, Ukraine comes out dead last in economic
growth.60 Ukraine is now the poorest country in Europe.61

In this, it was like other, smaller counties that essentially lie
between Russia and Western Europe: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Belarus. These countries have been characterized not by
the substantial political liberalization and economic development that
has variously taken place in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Romania, and in
countries that emerged out of Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1991.
Rather, the "in-between" countries, led by the most important, Ukraine,
suffer from a set of what Samuel Charap and Timothy Colton call
"post-Soviet pathologies": dysfunctional governmental institutions,
economies lacking functioning markets, a rule of law that is weak or
absent, patronal politics, close links between political power and
control of major economic assets, and "pervasive corruption."62

In the case of Ukraine, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by outside
efforts from Russia and from Europe to influence the country. These have
made it easier for Ukraine to avoid desperately-needed reforms.63 Among
these are huge economic distortions concerning energy. The world average
for energy consumption per dollar of GDP is 10 British thermal units.
For the US it is 7.5, for the UK 3.8, for Ukraine 56.3. 64

Things came to a head when mass protests by Western-oriented Ukrainians
broke out in the capital city, Kiev. Their duly elected president, who
was perhaps even more corrupt than his equally duly elected
predecessors, had been juggling various opposing aid offers from the
West and from Russia. When he more or less accepted the (higher) Russian
bid, protests broke out, and these endured through the cold and snowy
winter of 2013--14 heightened by sporadic violence by security forces
and by elements within the protest movement, particularly those from the
highly anti-Russian far right.65

In February 2014, Ukraine's president fled to Russia abruptly leaving
the extravagant private zoo he had created behind.66 In the subsequent
chaos, parliament removed provisions that had previously allowed the use
of Russian as an official language under some conditions.67

Largely ignored in these development were the interests of Russian
speakers in the country, some 30 percent of the population, who are
concentrated in the east and south and were decidedly unsympathetic to
the Kiev protests.68 This was particularly the case in the large Crimea
peninsula to the south where Russia, by an agreement brokered when the
Soviet Union split up in 1991, maintains a substantial naval base for
its Black Sea Fleet. Putin was alarmed at the developments in Kiev where
anti-Russian ideologues now occupied one-third of the cabinet seats. He
was also deeply concerned that the new government might abrogate or fail
to renew the lease on the naval base, seen to be vital national asset.69
And he was doubtless miffed that Western leaders had boycotted the
winter Olympics he had hosted a few months earlier.70

He bolstered troop strength at the naval base, and soon men in green
uniforms without insignia (known as "little green men") were fanning out
in Crimea occupying military and government facilities.71 Crimean
Russians often felt neglected over the years by government in Kiev, and
they feared after the fall of the president that they would be violently
persecuted.72 The local Crimean authorities organized a referendum on
secession and on March 16, 2014, a vote, boycotted by many, was held in
which 97 percent of those who voted supposedly supported leaving Ukraine
and joining Russia. Backed enthusiastically by his parliament and by the
citizenry of Russia, Putin graciously accepted the request.

Meanwhile, in Donbas -- areas abutting Russia in eastern Ukraine --
local Russians, emboldened by the events in Crimea, organized a
secession movement, setting up their own ad hoc governments. Ukrainian
armed forces, led initially mainly by volunteer paramilitaries, were
sent to put them down.73 Aided by infiltrators from Russia, the
secessionists were able to hold them to a stalemate. Over 10,000 were
killed in the violence.74

Ukraine cut off financial subsidies, electricity, and water supplies to
Crimea, and tourism, an important Crimean industry, dropped
precipitously. But Russia, at considerable cost, worked to alleviate
these problems, and in 2018 a 12-mile \$3 billion bridge -- the contract
went to one of Putin's buddies, a former judo partner -- had been
constructed to link Crimea with Russia, a country that, otherwise, ranks
ninety-fourth in the world in infrastructure. Putin drove the first
truck across the span himself.75 Efforts to integrate Crimea into Russia
have been extensive, and Russian retirees (especially military ones) are
encouraged to move there even as those opposed to the Russian takeover
often emigrate to Ukraine.

If the goal of Russia was to keep Ukraine from seeking to embrace the
West while, in Robert Person's words, "establishing a pliant pro-Russian
regime in Kiev," its efforts failed miserably.76 As one observer
predicted at the time, "Far from dissuading Ukrainians from seeking a
future in Europe, Moscow's moves will only foster a greater sense of
nationalism in all parts of the country and turn Ukrainian elites
against Russia, probably for a generation."77 Or as Daniel Treisman
observed in the aftermath, "If Putin's goal was to prevent Russia's
military encirclement, his aggression in Ukraine has been a tremendous
failure, since it has produced the exact opposite."78

In addition, [**[Russia's]{.underline}** **[experience
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [2014]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}**
and crisis in Ukraine **[[suggests]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
**[countries cannot engage in]{.underline}** such **[enterprises
without]{.underline}** **[[automatic]{.mark}ally]{.underline}**
**[paying a substantial]{.underline}** **[economic price -- it is
something like an]{.underline}** **[[economic doomsday]{.mark}
machine]{.underline}**. Because of its antics, **[Russia suffered a
[decline in]{.mark} the]{.underline}** [**[value]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its [currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[capital flight]{.underline}**, **[a drop in its]{.underline}**
[**[stock market]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
decline in]{.underline}** **[foreign [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
And, perhaps most importantly, **[there was a]{.underline}** **[very
substantial drop]{.underline}** **[in confidence by investors, buyers,
and sellers]{.underline}** throughout the world, a condition that is
likely to last for years, even decades.79 As Charap and Colton stress,
"Moscow is at serious risk of permanently alienating the entire EU,
which as a bloc has long been Russia's largest trading partner and
direct investor."80 One prominent British observer puts it even more
starkly, suggesting that the events "mark the end of an era, the end of
the hope that Russia could be incorporated into a united and peaceful
Europe."81 As part of this, Russia's behavior has set off a determined
effort by Europeans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy
supplies -- a change that could be permanent. And **[the]{.underline}**
**[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of]{.underline}** the conflict and
of supporting its new distant dependencies **[have been visited by
Russia on itself]{.underline}**. Crimea was less well off economically
than most of Ukraine and required subsidies from Kiev.82 And the Donbas
region was heavily subsidized by Ukraine as well.83 These
**[burdens]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** now **[[shifted
to]{.mark} Russia]{.underline}**.

**[There have been]{.underline}** other **[economic costs]{.underline}**
as well. Economic **[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been
**[visited on Russia]{.underline}** **[by other states]{.underline}**.
Although especially costly to Europe, they were embraced after rebels in
eastern Ukraine (perhaps accidentally) shot down a civilian airliner
with a missile presumably supplied by Russia.84 Unrelated to the crisis,
there was a severe drop in prices for oil on the international market, a
development that is especially harmful to Russia: for every decline of
\$25 in the price of oil, Russia experiences a nearly 2 percent decline
in GNP, and oil and gas sales fund about 36 percent of the Russian
annual budget. The economic pain inflicted by the oil price drop has
been much greater -- perhaps four times greater -- than that of the
sanctions.85

There is **[likely]{.underline}** as well **[to be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[special political cost for
Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Since he came to power in 2000, there has
been a steady improvement in Russia each year in GDP per capita. That
process was reversed in 2014. From 2014--17, real disposable income fell
by 15 percent.86 Aspirational purchases as for homes and cars have
shifted to ones devoted to daily needs.87 And Russia's Stabilization
Fund, built up when oil prices were high and meant to fund pension
payments and to support the ruble, was significantly depleted and may
run out of money entirely. Over time, **[some]{.underline}** may **[see
this as a]{.underline}** [**[break]{.underline}** **[with his promise
to]{.underline}** **[provide]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the]{.underline}** **[[stability]{.mark} and order]{.underline}**
**[necessary to allow economic progress]{.underline}** to take place.88

The **[developments in Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014
**[were]{.underline}** **[unsettling]{.underline}**, of course. However,
**[it is]{.underline}** **[impressive]{.underline}** that **[the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** Western
[**[Europe]{.underline}** **[never]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[even [came
close to]{.mark} seriously considering [the use of]{.mark} direct
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** to deal with the issue. Although the
crisis created, as Steven Pinker notes, "just the kinds of tensions that
in the past had led to great-power wars," nothing like that took
place.89 In fact, **[the West behaved in much]{.underline}** **[the same
way it would have]{.underline}** behaved **[if it had]{.underline}**
**[not possessed]{.underline}** **[a great and expensive]{.underline}**
**[military capacity]{.underline}**. Indeed, President Barack Obama, who
presided over the episode, was given to taunting his hawkish critics:
"Now, if there is somebody in this town that would claim that we would
consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and eastern Ukraine, they
should speak up and be very clear about it."90

The **[events]{.underline}** **[inspired concerns]{.underline}** that
**[Putin had or has wider intentions]{.underline}**.91 The
**[natural]{.underline}** **[next step]{.underline}**, suggest some,
**[would be some sort of invasion of the]{.underline}** **[Baltic
states]{.underline}** of Latvia, Lithuania, and/or Estonia.
**[Each]{.underline}**, like Ukraine, **[has a Russian
minority]{.underline}** which, in many cases, has not blended in well
with the majority culture and might even consider itself to be
persecuted.

West Point's Robert Person has **[looked at]{.underline}** the
**[parallels]{.underline}** **[and finds them wanting]{.underline}**.92
To begin with, **[[Ukraine has]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Person calls
"**[a]{.underline}** **[deep [symbolic meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[for Russia]{.underline}**." It had been part of the Russian empire
since the sixteenth century and is often considered to be "the cradle of
eastern Slavic civilization." Moreover, Crimea did not become part of
Ukraine until it was "gifted" to that Soviet republic in 1954 by Nikita
Khrushchev in a process that was quixotic and arbitrary and never
actually made official even by the regulations of Soviet or Communist
law.93 And, of course, Crimea's Russian naval base added special
significance. **[By contrast]{.underline}**, continues Person,
**[Latvia]{.underline}**, **[Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Estonia]{.underline}**, unlike Ukraine, **[have frequently enjoyed
an]{.underline}** **[independent status]{.underline}**, **[and
[Russians]{.mark} "have]{.underline}** **[[long
recognized]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[the [Baltics
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[culturally and historically
[different]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[from Russia]{.underline}**."
Moreover, **[Russians]{.underline}** **[in the Baltics]{.underline}**
**[[do not]{.mark} seem to [have]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[separatist]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** not least in part **[because they
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** much **[[higher standards]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}** do their **[counterparts
o]{.underline}**n **[the other side of the border]{.underline}**. And
**[because the Baltic states are members of the]{.underline}**
**[European Union]{.underline}** **[and its associated]{.underline}**
**[Schengen zon]{.underline}**e, **[their citizens would no
longer]{.underline}** **[enjoy the]{.underline}** associated **[ease of
travel to the continent]{.underline}** if they became part of Russia.94

In all, then, **[the]{.underline}** **[[notion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[that [Putin]{.mark}'s Russia [is on an]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[expansionary mission]{.underline}**]{.mark}, so commonly voiced at
the time of the 2014 events, **[seems to]{.underline}** **[[have little
substance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.95 It has **[[not]{.mark} even [sought
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[officially annex]{.underline}**
**[separatist areas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. A special issue of the journal Daedalus,
published in 2017, ran a series of essays dealing with Russia's future.
None envisioned territorial expansion.96

Definitions of superpower status common during the Cold War generally
stressed the possession of stocks of nuclear weapons. If that criterion
continued to be embraced, Russia should still probably be considered a
superpower. However, as Dmitri Trenin points out, **[Russia
"[has]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[few]{.mark} formal
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[no satellite states]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} \... **[[no]{.mark}
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}** to compare with the comprehensive dogma
of Marxism-Leninism." Moreover, "although it is still a nuclear
superpower, **[it [lags]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[far]{.underline}**
**[behind the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates in
non-nuclear [military]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Economically, Russia]{.underline}**
-- with its estimated 1.5 percent of the global gross domestic product
-- **[is a dwarf]{.underline}**."97 Its GDP ranks twelfth in the world,
but is only one-fifteenth that of the United States and about half that
of California. Moreover, GDP growth in Russia has been weak with recent
figures at about 1.8 percent per year, and it relies heavily on selling
energy abroad: nearly 50 percent of its exports are in oil and gas. Its
**[[population]{.mark} is]{.underline}**
**[[shrinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** and may, according to medium-term
projections, be reduced to 125 million by 2094 from the current level of
about 148 million. **[For an economy that is]{.underline}** **[more
people-intensive]{.underline}** **[than other advanced economies,
[this]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[spells trouble]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
As Barack Obama pointed out derisively, if undiplomatically, in his
final news conference as president, "Their **[economy doesn't
produce]{.underline}** **[anything that anybody wants]{.underline}**
**[to buy]{.underline}**, except oil and gas and arms. They don't
innovate."98

The (rather **[bizarre) Russia suffers from]{.underline}** the same
problems as the "in-between" counties as discussed above while
**[being]{.underline}** **[[burdened]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition
**[[by a]{.mark} much larger military budget -- although]{.underline}**
**[[weak]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** also **[been reflected [in
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[shrinking]{.underline}**
**[military]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[budget]{.underline}**, down about
5 percent in 2018 from 2017. Like China, it has **[devolved into a form
of]{.underline}** **[crony capitalism]{.underline}**
**[where]{.underline}** **[[property rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[are [insecure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[capital
[flight]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is [common]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[is
[rampant]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[economic [stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[is
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Anders Aslund concludes, the state
has been captured by a small group of top officials with the topmost
being Vladimir Putin, who has 20 palaces, four yachts, 58 aircraft, and
a collection of watches worth \$600,000. 99

**[[Ukraine]{.mark} episode]{.underline}** of 2014
**[[seems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the Korean invasion of 1950,
**[to]{.underline}** **[be [a one-off]{.mark} -- a]{.underline}**
**[unique]{.underline}**, **[opportunistic]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** probably **[under-considered]{.underline}**
**[escapade that]{.underline}** **[proved to be unexpectedly costly to
the perpetrators]{.underline}**. As with the Korean case, **[massive
[extrapolation is]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[unjustified and
[ill-advised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, the Ukrainian venture,
contrary to much initial speculation, does not seem to be a
game-changer.100

As Trenin points out, **[Moscow's]{.underline}** **[most important
objective]{.underline}** **[is to reassert its role as a]{.underline}**
**[great power]{.underline}** **[with a global reach]{.underline}**.
However, **[it does]{.underline}** **[not]{.underline}** **[seek to
impose its own model on]{.underline}** **[the world]{.underline}**. In
all this, [**[neither side]{.underline}** **[envisions
a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[real [shooting war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[against its adversary]{.underline}** **[and neither
wants]{.underline}** to allow **[the situation to become]{.underline}**
**[uncontrollable]{.underline}**.101

Even if China is willing to fulfill its mission by launching a war with
the U.S., [can [China]{.mark}]{.underline} **[afford it]{.underline}**?
First, [the top Chinese leader [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not ready
for war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with U.S]{.underline}. [China
will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [be able to take a
risk]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** internal [coordination and
support]{.underline}. The voice of China's foreign policy comes from
different departments. [They are]{.underline} **[[not]{.mark} well
[coordinated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and lack]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a long-term vision. [China does
not have a]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
making [consistent and workable foreign policy]{.underline}, and the top
leader has not gained sufficient power to manage foreign relations.
[China is [facing a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mountain of domestic
problems]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[corruption]{.underline}** [in the military]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[Chinese government]{.underline} has [learned the lesson]{.underline}
that [a combination of internal violence and external conflict can
contribute to the]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the
regime]{.underline}. Now **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping
[is]{.underline} more [likely to [focus on]{.mark} China's]{.underline}
**[domestic]{.underline}** [issues especially [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[pandemic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [consequences
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[economic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[financial]{.underline}** [areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xi's [top
priority]{.underline} before the 20th Congress of the CCP [is
to]{.underline} carefully [manage the]{.underline} **[power
balance]{.underline}** [among factions in the party]{.underline},
attempting to ensure his third term of presidency. After the 20th
Congress, Xi will take some time to reorganize the system and put new
policies in place. It is [not wise for the CCP to take]{.underline}
**[military risks]{.underline}** [in dealing with territorial disputes
with various countries at the same time as it tries to
maintain]{.underline} **[domestic]{.underline}** [social
stability]{.underline}. China cannot afford to fight against multiple
countries at the same time because [the [U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[military treaties]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with several allies in the
region]{.underline}. [[Taking military action]{.mark}s
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [**[destroy]{.underline}** [Xi's
China Dream]{.underline}]{.mark}, his lifelong
[[presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}, his [domestic [agenda
and]{.mark}]{.underline} China's [global [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}
eventually. Considering all these challenges, [Chinese
leaders]{.underline} may **[continue]{.underline}** their [efforts
to]{.underline} **[rebalance]{.underline}** [the relationship between
China and the U.S. while boosting]{.underline} the [economic
growth]{.underline} and preparing the unification with Taiwan after the
20th National Congress of the CCP in 2022.

Second, [China]{.underline} has [understood]{.underline} that **[any
conflict]{.underline}** between China and the U.S. [would be
a]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [disaster]{.underline},
especially between the two nuclear powers.78 A war between the two
giants is unthinkable.79 It could be a Third World War if the U.S. had a
war with China.80 China now has 260 nuclear weapons in its stockpile,
while the U.S. has 4670 or more. [[China]{.mark} promised that it would
[implement a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**o
**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se" nuclear
[policy]{.underline}, implying that the country possesses nuclear
weapons only to deter other states from a nuclear attack and expresses
the purely self-defensive nature of China's nuclear strategy. More
fundamentally, [it has demonstrated a]{.underline} viable [path
toward]{.underline} international **[nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}**.81 Many China experts "appear not to be
worried by China's rapidly growing nuclear capabilities, because
[Beijing's official policy promises]{.underline} that [China will not be
the]{.underline} **[first]{.underline}** [to employ nuclear weapons in a
conflict]{.underline}. Beijing promises that its nuclear forces are for
deterrence and retaliation only, not for aggression."82 However, China
continues to develop its nuclear weapons. China is likely to double the
size of its nuclear stockpile in a few years.83 U.S. military leaders
are not as naïve as academics about China's "no first use" pledge.
Charles Richard, chief of U.S. Strategic Command, testified to the
Senate Armed Services Committee that he could "drive a truck through
China's 'no first use' policy, because China's unprecedented rapid
expansion of its nuclear and missile capabilities is not consistent with
a belief in 'minimum deterrence' and 'no first use.'"84 In January 2022,
five global nuclear powers who are the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, the U.S., the UK, Russia, China, and France, signed a
joint statement and agreed to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading and
to ensure a nuclear war would not happen. The agreement itself is a
positive sign, indicating that nuclear deterrence is working and there
will be no massive war between China and the U.S.85 Practically, it is
hard to trust a dictator's words. In March 2022, Putin already put
nuclear deterrent forces on high alert and attacked Europe's largest
nuclear plant just a month after Russia signed the joint statement.

Third, [the Chinese [economy and military]{.mark} are]{.underline}
**[[not strong enough]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to support
war]{.underline} with the U.S. China will unlikely enter to war if it
cannot win because [the CCP]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}**
[afford a loss]{.underline}. China will wage war when it sees itself
winning at least cost. China is the fastest-growing economy in the world
but [there are many]{.underline} more [statistics that]{.underline} come
to the front of arguments, which [question the]{.underline} size of the
[Chinese]{.underline} economy and its actual **[economic]{.underline}**
[situation]{.underline}. The economic and social [consequences
of]{.underline} **[zero-case]{.underline}** [tolerance policy
are]{.underline} clearly [serious and far-reaching]{.underline}. China
is still a developing country. [China does]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rank [among the 100 richest]{.mark}
nations]{.underline} based on **[[per capita]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Among 1.4 billion people, about 50% of Chinese people live in rural
areas, 400 million people live on less than \$2 a day, and 200 million
people live on less than a dollar per day. Even if China will continue
its economic growth for years, [it may]{.underline}
**[never]{.underline}** [surpass the U.S. because it faces]{.underline}
**[many obstacles]{.underline}**.86 [[U.S. military spending
grows]{.mark} as]{.underline} **[policy shifts]{.underline}**
[[to]{.mark} "prioritize China" with]{.underline} **[\$[813]{.mark}.3
[billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2022 [while [China's]{.mark} military
spending has reached]{.underline} **[\$[230]{.mark}
billion]{.underline}** in 2022. China's military budget is only about
28% of the U.S. The PLA has approximately 975,000 active-duty personnel,
the largest navy in the world with an overall battle force of
approximately 355 ships and submarines, the largest aviation force in
the region and the third largest in the world, with over 2800 total
aircraft of which approximately 2250 are combat aircraft. China develops
new intercontinental ballistic missiles, continues to increase its
inventory of road-mobile DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles
(IRBM), and has its first operational hypersonic weapons system, the
DF-17 hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), and medium-range ballistic missile
(MRBM). China is determined to build a "world-class" military by the end
of 2049.87 However, [the]{.underline} [**[comprehensive]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the PLA]{.underline} still **[[lags far
behind]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline}** [If China learned a lesson
from]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**'s failures in the invasion of
Ukraine, [it should never take on the U.S. head even when fully
modernized]{.underline}. Although China's navy, ground troop, and air
forces have developed rapidly in the past two decades,
[[considering]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[quality]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[overall strength]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the
military, [as well as]{.mark} the strength of military
[alliances]{.mark}, China would]{.underline} **[lose]{.underline}** [the
war if it launched a war with the U.S.]{.underline} Any war with the
U.S. will be near its shores where [the U.S. will have a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** [winning advantage]{.underline}.88

Fourth, [China will feel]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** [to
justify a war]{.underline} with U.S. Military strength is the basis for
consideration if China goes to war. [If China's military power is at
an]{.underline} absolute **[advantage]{.underline}**, [it]{.underline}
still [lacks the]{.underline} **[pre-conditions]{.underline}** [for war
with the U.S.]{.underline} If China's military power evenly matches with
the U.S., it should be cautious about starting a war. China has not
arrived at the stage to initiate a war. Military power is not simply
about military budget and weapons. **[Real]{.underline}** war
**[experience]{.underline}** [must be taken into
consideration]{.underline}. [China does not have real]{.underline}
military [experience to win a]{.underline} **[modern]{.underline}**
[war]{.underline} with the U.S. After the establishment of the PRC,
China went to conventional war several times, including the Korean War,
the war with India (1967), and the Vietnam War (1979). It cannot rule
out that China will follow the same pattern to go to war in the future.
However, the Iraq war and the 2022 War between Russia and Ukraine
indicate that contemporary war is completely different from traditional
war. Chinese military power is untested in the contemporary military
war. Moreover, the CCP has not faced an immediate military threat from
the U.S. Military experts' [research projects on when and why
Beijing]{.underline} **[uses force]{.underline}** have [reached
a]{.underline} **[similar]{.underline}** [conclusion]{.underline}:
[[China attacks not when]{.mark} it feels]{.underline}
**[[confident]{.underline}]{.mark}** about the future, [[but when
it]{.underline} **[worries]{.underline}**]{.mark} [its [enemies are
closing in]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thomas Christensen, the director of the
China and the World Program at Columbia University, points out that the
Chinese Communist Party wages war when it perceives an opening window of
vulnerability regarding its territory and immediate periphery, or a
closing window of opportunity to consolidate control over disputed
areas. This [pattern holds]{.underline} **[regardless]{.underline}** [of
the strength of China's opponent]{.underline}.89 The
**[Biden]{.underline}** Administration has [made it clear]{.underline}
that [the U.S. does not intend to change the Chinese regime]{.underline}
while competing with China on various fronts. When China does not face a
direct military threat from the U.S., [the CCP does not
have]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}** [to take risk of going to
war]{.underline}.

Fifth, [it could be [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[suicide]{.underline}**
[mission]{.underline}]{.mark} [if China decided [to go to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} with the U.S. before improving its military
quality. [The]{.underline} **[quality of]{.underline}** military
**[commanders]{.underline}** [is the key]{.underline} to win or defeat
in wars. The quality of fighters and the wisdom of commanders are
inseparable. Wise commanders should be capable of planning and deploying
a variety of plans before the war starts. Even if Chinese military power
cannot match the U.S. as long as they can carry out military strikes at
a right time and at a favorable location, China can still win. Overall,
[Chinese military commanders]{.underline} **[do not]{.underline}**
[possess]{.underline} such a [quality]{.underline}. Soldier qualities
include military skills and knowledge, actual combat and decision-making
capabilities, physical endurance, and psychological qualities. Since the
war between China and Vietnam in 1979, China has been no war with other
countries for more than 40 years. China's active military personnel grew
up in peacetime and enlisted in a peaceful environment. During the forty
years of reform and opening-up period, the military is inevitably
influenced by the peaceful lifestyle. [Although China]{.underline} has
**[dramatically]{.underline}** [increased military expenditures and
speeded up]{.underline} its [military modernization, the PLA obviously
[lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[sufficient actual]{.underline}**]{.mark}
combat **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [involving the integration
of sea, land, and air battles]{.underline}. In recent years, China has
tried to improve its military combat effectiveness, but [the Chinese
military has a]{.underline} **[long way to catch up]{.underline}**
[[with]{.mark} the [U.S.' experience]{.mark} of real war]{.underline}.
The one-child policy seriously affects the quality of the military.
China's active military personnel have grown up in a relatively superior
environment, and men will be particularly favored regardless of whether
they come from the city or the countryside, so they lack self-care
ability, communication skills, patience, and endurance. Their personal
character is very fragile and is likely to collapse on the battlefield.

Sixth, the morale of the Chinese army is low. The [morale of the army is
the]{.underline} **[spiritual pillar]{.underline}** [in the
war]{.underline}; morale makes the war invincible under certain
conditions; and the army would be a mess without morale. Morale is not
an empty political slogan, but it is courage and determination when they
face the enemy. Morale is not injected by propaganda but is nurtured by
faith and the example of officers and actual interests. Under the
one-party system and the rigid censorship system, [Chinese
soldiers]{.underline} like all Chinese citizens [have been]{.underline}
**[brainwashed]{.underline}** [by communist ideas]{.underline}. The
[injected]{.underline} so-called **[communist belief]{.underline}**
[without faith could be]{.underline} **[suddenly]{.underline}**
[collapsed during a real war in a real world]{.underline}. In addition,
China's [corruption is]{.underline} **[systematic]{.underline}**, [and
the military is]{.underline} **[no exception]{.underline}** [from the
top to the bottom]{.underline} of the military system. By January 2015,
sixteen senior military officers were under investigation for
accusations of corruption. These officers are at the corps level or
above. They include one general, four lieutenant generals, nine major
generals, and one senior colonel. After Xu Caihou, former vice-chairman
of the Central Military Commission, was caught in 2014, the CPC began to
investigate Guo Boxiong in 2015, the second former top military officer
on suspicion of corruption. Fang Fenghui, China's military chief of
staff was jailed for life for corruption in 2019. Military corruption
deadly threatens China's security and degrades China's military
capability in protecting its nation. One of the causes of the
Nationalist government's defeat was corruption, which destroyed the
morale of the military. [Chinese [soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[witnessed]{.underline} **[systematic corruption]{.underline}** in the
post-Mao era, [so they [will not]{.mark} be willing to]{.underline}
[**[sacrifice]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [corrupted
[Chinese]{.mark} military [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. To regain
morale, China must reform its political system, clean up corrupted
military officials, change the compulsory military service system, and
improve Chinese soldiers' salaries and benefits.

Seventh, [[peaceful resolution to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[resolve
territorial [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[remains the first
choice]{.mark} for]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}**
[sides]{.underline}. The goal of diplomacy is to persuade your enemy to
surrender without a fight. A weak country does not have diplomacy.
National comprehensive power determines diplomatic confidence; and
military power and popular support provide the precondition for winning
war. If a country's comprehensive power is insufficient, it can only
deal with territory disputer through unequal diplomacy. If the military
is powerful and the people's aspirations are strong, military force
deterrence should cooperate with diplomatic means. If a country is not
ready, it must not advocate war. Otherwise, the government would lose
its credibility at home and abroad. [[China and]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[have]{.underline}
**[sufficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} [time to take]{.underline}
**[[diplomatic measures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to fulfill their
mission]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** [any cost]{.underline}.
In addition, a [possible war over the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[and]{.underline} the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** Strait [is not a
conventional land war but sea-air warfare]{.underline}. [If war
occurs]{.underline} over the region, [the U.S.]{.underline}
**[superiority]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[ASB]{.underline}**
[is still absolute and China's military attempts would]{.underline}
**[fail]{.underline}** although China has massive ground troops and the
largest size of navy force in the world.

Eighth, **[Russia]{.underline}** could be a negative equity for China on
the global stage and [will]{.underline} **[not help China]{.underline}**
[win war with the U.S. after]{.underline} Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}. [[China has]{.underline}]{.mark} very **[[few
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [whereas American allies in the Pacific
include]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}**,
**[Australia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea. While China is losing its neighboring friends,
[the U.S. has been]{.underline} **[strengthening]{.underline}** [its
alliance with China's neighboring countries]{.underline}, including
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Afghanistan, and India. [Other
countries, such as]{.underline} **[Vietnam]{.underline}**,
**[Malaysia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Myanmar]{.underline}**
[are drawing closer]{.underline} to the U.S. The Chinese government
views the regional tension as the outcome of Washington's "returning to
Asia" policy. Under this circumstance, [China needs]{.underline}
**[help]{.underline}** from Russia [to avoid escalating
confrontations]{.underline} with multiple neighboring countries. In a
global context, Russia has played a considerable role in China--U.S.
relations since the Cold War. The recent development of China--Russia
relations has once again raised American concerns about the implications
of Beijing--Moscow relations. Many experts believe that China's motive
for deepening its relations with Russia is anti-America. According to
the joint statement between Russia and China released before the 2022
Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the two countries' relationship has no
limits and there are no forbidden areas. Now there are two parallel
geopolitical conflicts---the Ukraine--Russia war and China--U.S. tension
over the Taiwan Strait. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed that the China--Russia partnership is solid
as stone and the Sino-Russian partnership continues, no matter how
serious the international situation is. China's current stance seems
that China has fully thrown itself into a de facto alliance with Russia.

China and Russia are almost impossible to form a solid partnership.
Superficially, the top leaders of the two countries can get along but
their personal relationship cannot be automatically translated into
foreign policy and military alliances. The restoration of the friendship
between Beijing and Moscow is mainly driven by their domestic pressures
and security concerns. A stable relationship between the two countries
will relieve the financial burdens in support of the hostility along the
sizeable border. Beijing and Moscow also have common interests to work
together. Beijing demands more oil and natural gas from Russia and needs
more advanced military weapons supplies, including submarines, warships,
and aircraft. Russia wants more investments from China to speed up the
development of the Russian economy. Arguably, China does not really need
military technologies from Russia. For example, the Chinese J-20 fighter
is more advanced than Su-35, equivalent to Russia's T50 and the U.S.
F-22. The purpose of China to purchase 24 Su-35 is not to bridge the gap
between Chinese and U.S. military power, but to show its sincerity to
consolidate its ties with Russia by offering economic incentives.
Strategically, they believe that the two nations face similar strategic
challenge posed by the U.S. and its allies: NATO expansion for Russia
and the U.S. conflicts with China over the Taiwan Strait. On the global
stage, they stand against American hegemony with sovereignty and
non-intervention as their core values.90

China's quick move closer to Russia has not convinced the Russian people
to believe that China is trustworthy in part because of the
inconsistency of Chinese foreign policy. China aligned with Russia in
the 1950s and with the U.S. in the 1970s but implemented a nonaligned
policy in the 1980s. In recent years, the Russian protests against the
Chinese economic invasion have taken place from time to time. The most
recent Russian protests took place in March 2019, which were triggered
by a China-funded project to bottle water from Russia's Lake Baikal that
has caused environmental problems and made Russian people very angry.
The Russian protests indicate that the China--Russia tie is fragile.91
China's move closer to Russia has received a lukewarm response from
public opinion in China. The Chinese people also have reasons to doubt
Moscow's sincerity. China is not happy that Russia has maintained close
military ties with and sold advanced weapons to India and Vietnam, both
are locked in territorial disputes with China.92 From a historical
perspective, Russia occupied China's territories totaling more than four
million square kilometers from 1689 to 1898, forced China to sign the
Yalta Agreement for recognizing Outer Mongolia as an independent country
in the 1940s, and stopped all financial and technological aid during the
Chinese economic crisis in the 1960s. Finally, Zhen Bao Island military
conflict in Heilongjiang Province broke out in 1969. Although in 1991
Russia acknowledged that the island belonged to China, the tension
between the two countries along the 2500 miles long border remained high
until the Chinese military troops retreated 500 km in 2008. In addition,
China cannot forget that Russia took the territories in northeast China
more than 100 years ago. On 2 July 2020, the Russian embassy in Beijing
posted a video of a party celebrating the 160th anniversary of the
founding of Vladivostok, which means "ruler of the east" in Russian and
was annexed from China by the Tsarist empire in 1860. The video reminded
the Chinese emotions over historic wounds and prompted an online
backlash with the posts such as "Today we can only endure, but the
Chinese people will remember!" "This ancestral land will return home in
the future!"93 In comparison with China--U.S. relations, the U.S. never
had a single territory dispute with China, so the Chinese people have
not had a similar historical complex toward the U.S. The mutual distrust
between China and Russia partially explains why Chinese students do not
enthusiastically choose to study in Russia. According to Russian media,
in 2020, only about 48,000 Chinese students studied in Russian
universities while 20,000 Russian students were in Chinese
universities.94 By contrast, more than 317,000 Chinese students enrolled
in U.S. institutions in 2020/21 regardless of Covid-19 spread across the
country. The list of other favorite destinations for Chinese students
does not include Russia, but Britain, Australia, Canada, Japan, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Korea. As a result,
Russian culture has little impact on Chinese society and intellectual
circle while American culture is very popular in China. The future of
Sino-Russia relations will be tested by public opinion in both
countries. It is expected that it would be difficult for both countries
to continue drawing closer without the support of the public opinion.

For now, the status of Sino-Russia relations is not a full-fledged
alliance, but a quasi-alliance. It seems that China and Russia are
closer than ever. Although a close relationship between China and Russia
could help China to get more advantage in bargaining with the U.S. to
smoothly solve its territorial disputes with neighboring countries, in
the long run, [[China will]{.mark} gain]{.underline} less but [**[lose
more]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [great power
[competition]{.mark} when China moves]{.underline} **[closer to
Russia]{.underline}**. Moscow and Beijing are on their honeymoon now,
but it may not last long. On the one hand, China's initial move closer
to Russia reflects that Chinese leaders lack confidence in dealing with
potential regional crises alone. Beijing does not necessarily have the
intention to save Russia, but it must save the Putin's regime in order
to retain Xi Jinping's power and the one-party system. On the other
hand, Russia will not satisfy with its lower position under Xi's
umbrella after Russia becomes significantly weaker because of the
failures of Putin's war with Ukraine. Russian ambassador already made it
clear that Russia does not seek an alliance with China. If China
unilaterally pursued the goal, the result would be poor. Therefore, it
is un-matured to predict that China and Russia will become alliances in
a decade. According to Schell-Shirk China Task Force, "China's alignment
is not set in stone. There are significant ways in which China's
long-term national interests are not, in fact, aligned with Russia's,
and deft U.S. diplomacy might still be able to find ways to temper
Beijing's alliance with Moscow."95 In the long term, Beijing and Moscow
might have more potential conflicts than cooperation and could become
main competitors or rivals down the road. [It is]{.underline} **[not
wise]{.underline}** [for Chinese leaders to]{.underline}
**[distance]{.underline}** themselves [from the U.S. by]{.underline}
**[overplaying]{.underline}** [the "Russian card."]{.underline}
Essentially, [China--[U.S. relations]{.mark} will [continue to be
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[top priority]{.underline}** [of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}['s foreign policy]{.underline}, when the CCP
carefully balances the triangle relations between China and the U.S. and
Russia.

Cold War with Chinese and American characteristics

We don't know precisely what the tastemakers, or whoever decides these
things, will call this Cold War. [We should **disqualify** Cold War 2.0
for its **frivolity** and]{.underline} the implicit
[suggestion]{.underline} that [we are dealing with]{.underline} an
**[upgrade]{.underline}**.

My preference is Cold War II, pronounced with the same stresses as World
War II, to remind us (1) of the destruction this rivalry could wreak if
it turns hot and (2) of continuities between the 1947-1991 contest and
the one that began in 2012. Just as many historians now view the two
world wars as a single conflict with a long intermission, we should see
the two Cold Wars as related phases in the evolution of world order in
the post-colonial and global eras.

But [continuities should not be]{.underline}
over**[emphasized]{.underline}**. There are factors unique to the Second
Cold War that will shape its prosecution and outcome:

- **[[Multilat]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}**, and what Fareed Zakaria
  called "The Rise of the Rest," [[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that
  [[neither China nor]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can aim for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
  kind of **[complete [victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [the
  U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [achieved in Cold War I.
  **[Allies]{.mark}**, **partners**, and **opponents**,
  with]{.underline} shifting degrees of [[**commitment** to
  **both**]{.mark} **powers**]{.underline}, now [have experience, tools,
  and agency that they did not have in]{.underline} the mid-[20th
  century. This will [enable them to **modify**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
  frustrate the [[strategies of both]{.mark} major powers]{.underline}
  in Cold War II. [**Multilateralism** will speak against]{.underline}
  the [formation of **blocs** and may involve both]{.underline} great
  [powers in]{.underline} networks of [**compromise** that **[deter
  aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

- Unless there is a military conflict, the legacy of 40 years of
  [Sino-US [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[put a **floor**
  under]{.underline}]{.mark} mutual [[hostility]{.mark}. **Engagement**
  will not cease]{.underline} altogether. Despite downward trends in
  public opinion, [Chinese and Americans]{.underline} have come to
  [know]{.underline} and like [each other **too well** for distrust to
  devolve into **hatred**]{.underline}. Chinese-Americans, who may face
  increased suspicion in Cold War II, will also play a key role in
  keeping lines of kinship and communication open and in reminding both
  sides---the United States in particular---of the historical benefits
  of openness and interaction.

- The legacy of the [first Cold War will]{.underline} also [inform
  conduct]{.underline} in the second. The world has done a version of
  this before: [We have **analyzed errors**, institutionalized
  **successful practices**, and socialized distrust of]{.underline} the
  propaganda and [motives of major powers]{.underline}. Nations are no
  wiser than they were in the second half of the 20th century, but, as
  Cold War veterans, [they are better equipped to
  **resist**]{.underline} traditional **[Cold War]{.underline}**
  tactics.

- [[China and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
  [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} both [be
  **distracted**]{.mark} from rivalry [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the large
  number of **[epochal [changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** whose
  simultaneous emergence is the distinguishing feature of the age. The
  [Rise of China is transformational]{.underline}---it compels us to
  reconsider our geopolitical assumptions---[but we are]{.underline}
  also [confronted with **equally great** challenges in other
  arenas:]{.underline} global [**[warming]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
  loss of **[biod]{.underline}**iversity; the [globalization of
  **[supply]{.mark} chains**, **[pathogens]{.mark}**, crime, ideas,
  information, economic disparity, and **[population]{.mark}
  flows**]{.underline}; the [emergence of **[new
  tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies, like synthetic biology and
  genetic engineering; and, on a longer timetable, [**revolutions** in
  gender roles and]{.underline} patterns of [belief]{.underline},
  including rising rates of secularism and religious extremism, that
  will reshape societies.

- We faced nothing of the kind in Cold War I. It's as if the rise of the
  United States, the little ice age, the extinction of the dinosaurs,
  the invention of moveable type, the Reformation, the Gilded Age and
  Great Depression, the Black Death, the Industrial Revolution, and the
  discovery of the germ theory of disease all appeared worldwide in a
  50-year span. Due to the concurrence of these epochal shifts,
  [managing US-China competition]{.underline}---which is the world's
  greatest geopolitical challenge---[may not be the **greatest
  challenge** we confront]{.underline}. The United States and China will
  face pressures to compromise and cooperate during the Second Cold War
  that the United States and Soviet Union did not experience during the
  first. [Meeting these challenges]{.underline}, moreover, [[will
  **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the resources and
  **[attention]{.underline}** that [Washington and Beijing]{.underline}
  can [dedicate to]{.underline} their
  **[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

- While the stakes of Cold War II are high, [[full-bore]{.mark}
  strategic [rivalry]{.mark} may **[never gather]{.mark} steam** [due
  to]{.mark}]{.underline} both nations' **[domestic
  [fragility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Political
  [**[polarization]{.mark}** and international perceptions
  of]{.underline} its failures and [unreliability]{.underline}
  ~~cripple~~ \[**[[devastate]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [[the
  U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as a global
  actor. [[China]{.mark} is [constrained by **geography**
  and]{.mark}]{.underline} by a number of [intractable
  problems]{.underline}, any one of [which could force it to
  **curtail**]{.underline} its [**global ambitions** and turn
  inward:]{.underline} corporate and government [**[debt]{.mark}**; an
  **aging population** and insufficient social safety net]{.underline};
  **[corruption]{.underline}**; **[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
  air, water, and soil; the **[water shortage]{.underline}** in the
  north; stark **[economic disparities]{.underline}**; global resistance
  to Chinese influence; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[sclerotic
  [political system]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is [out of step with a
  modern populace]{.underline}. While these
  [[weaknesses]{.underline}]{.mark} might cause either country to lash
  out at the other to build popular support, they could also
  [[**convince** leaders to make **accommodations**]{.underline}]{.mark}
  in the future that they would not consider today.

In the opening sentence of Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger wrote that "in
every century there seems to emerge a country with the power, the will,
and the intellectual and moral impetus to shape the entire international
system in accordance with its own values." [Many]{.underline} Chinese
would [read]{.underline} that line as an [anointing of]{.underline} the
People's Republic of [**China** for the 21st century. They would be
**wrong**. While [China]{.mark} has the **will** to shape]{.underline}
the [international system]{.underline}, its [[power]{.mark} is
**[uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and its [intellectual and moral

**[A THUCYDIDES' TRAP?]{.underline}**

The [most widely discussed contemporary work]{.underline} using
Thucydides as a guide for twenty-first century grand strategy [is Graham
Allison's Destined for War]{.underline}: Can America and China Escape
Thucydides' Trap?5 Like [power transition theorists]{.underline},
Allison [regards]{.underline} the [[**decline** of]{.mark} existing
hegemonic [powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the rise of new ones [as a
major [source of]{.mark} **great power conflict** and
**[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline}6 Indeed, by his calculation, in three
quarters of such cases rising and declining great powers became
entrapped in war.7 [It is not surprising Allison and others would look
to the Peloponnesian War because here is **[ev]{.mark}**idence that
another power transition is going on with [China]{.mark}
"**[rising]{.mark}**" [relative to the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates in many direct and latent indicators of national
power.]{.underline}8 [China]{.underline}, once a hierarchical power in
East Asia, [seems bent on reestablishing something like that
today]{.underline}.9 How would Thucydides recommend that the United
States respond?

[As **China** rises and **narrows** the relative power advantage of the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, Thucydides offers insights into how
the United States should respond. [A careful reading of **[Thucydides
suggests]{.mark}** that a [balance]{.mark}, rather than **trying** to
maintain preponderance, should be **sufficient** to **protect** U.S.
interests.]{.underline}

[Criticism of Allison's take on Thucydides has become **something** of a
**cottage** industry]{.underline}. Not all Western scholars would go so
far as Jonathan Kirshner in dismissing Destined for War out of hand as
"sloppy, superficial, oversimplified, overconfident, and repetitive,"
but it is fair to say many found much wanting in the book.10 [Nor have
[Chinese leaders]{.mark} or scholars found the analogy between the great
war between Athens and Sparta [and]{.mark} the twenty-first century
U.S.-China rivalry useful]{.underline}, save perhaps as an indicator of
how America views their rise. [Chinese President **[Xi]{.mark} Jinping**
categorically [**denied** there is any]{.mark} "such thing [as]{.mark}
the so-called **[Thucydides trap]{.mark}** in the world."]{.underline}11
The majority of [Chinese scholars "**reject** the so-called **metaphor**
from history]{.underline} and regard this simplistic historical analogy
as the newest version of the longstanding 'China Threat Theory.'"12
China Threat Theory is an umbrella under which a number of arguments
come together about why China's rise is not likely to be peaceful.13 Not
to pile on, but Allison's use of Thucydides is muddled. Allison himself
puts this slightly differently: He admits he holds "two contradictory
ideas in \[his\] head at the same time."14 Either way, Allison is not
clear on some important points as to how we ought to think about the
U.S.-China rivalry through Thucydides' lens.

A TRAP OR A CHOICE?

For instance, he is equivocal about what he means by a "trap." In some
places he suggests "destiny" is not "inevitability," and smart
leadership can avoid this geopolitical snare.15 But in other places,
Allison notes the trap defied "the ancient world's two most fabled
powers" leaders' efforts to "avoid" war. Elsewhere, he adds the
Thucydides trap "create\[s\] a dynamic that is extremely difficult to
manage successfully."16 If not "inevitable," war between the United
States and China is highly probable given his on gloss the history of
great power conflict.17 Indeed, in his assessment of 500 years of the
rise and fall of great powers he calculates 75 percent of the time
rising and declining powers come to blows.18 Given that, it is not
surprising the title of his book is Destined for War.

Allison's muddle on this issue may in part reflect the debate among
scholars and translators about Thucydides' own views of the
"inevitability" of the great war between Athens and Sparta. The famous
Crawley translation of section 1.23.6 translates Thucydides as declaring
"the growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in
Sparta, made war inevitable (emphasis added)."19 Other translations,
though, are far less determinative. Jeremy Mynott, for example,
translates Thucydides as suggesting "the Athenians were becoming
powerful and inspired fear in the Spartans and so forced them into
war."19 I agree, therefore, with Arthur M. Eckstein that Thucydides did
not mean the war is "inevitable" absent decisions of the leaders of
Sparta and especially Athens, so the widely used Richard Crawley
translation is misleading on this score.20 Arlene Saxenhouse concedes
there is what she calls a "power trap" in Thucydides---fear makes the
powerful pursue yet more power to counter the power-seeking of others,
resulting in a spiral of conflict---but notes neither Thucydides nor his
hero Pericles thought all-out, catastrophic war was inevitable.22
Indeed, in his famous eulogy for Pericles in Book II, Thucydides praises
Pericles' strategic prudence and deplores the lack of it among his
successors, thereby suggesting a major role for choice.23

Relatedly, in some places, Allison seems to advocate some elements of a
Balance of Power-type strategy as means to avert U.S.-China conflict;
but elsewhere in the book he indicts realpolitik as part of the problem,
associating it with the later Athenian thesis at Melos---"the strong do
what they can and the weak suffer what they must"24---and perhaps tying
it to those contemporary analysts who think that the way the U.S. should
respond to the rise of China is to keep it down.25 Given that, the
balance of power realist case for how to deal with a rising China still
remains to be made.

U.S. GRAND STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR TODAY

What are the strategic choices available to the United States to deal
with the rise of China? There are essentially two: One approach, which
is widely embraced within the U.S. government and endorsed by many
pundits and scholars, is that the way to avoid hegemonic war is to avert
power transition altogether by maintaining U.S. dominance. Indeed, the
notion we need to contain or otherwise stay ahead of China dominates
much official thinking in Washington, DC. This could be done
unilaterally by simply staying as far ahead of the Chinese as possible
in terms of both direct and latent indices of power. This is the power
maximization of grand strategies like \"primacy.\"26 However, the more
widely embraced strategy for maintaining U.S. hegemony these days is to
emphasize its collective benefits and constrain its power through
international institutions. Both \"deep engagement\" (the forward
deployment of U.S. power to directly manage the international system)
and \"liberal internationalism\" (the use of international institutions
by the United States to do so) employ versions of this argument.27

The other approach would set more realistic goals for the United States
in response to the rise of China: work to maintain a balance of power.
This choice, in turn, hinges on a central issue in international
relations theory: Is a concentration of power the natural equilibrium,
hence it is the case that great powers, and perhaps lesser powers,
should seek hegemony? Or is a balance of power the best situation and
the most that great powers can reasonably aspire to and maintain?28 The
"balance of power" refers to an equilibrium of peace between states or
groups of them maintained by the military policies of each side.29 The
latter is the lesson readers should take away from Thucydides' chronicle
of the great war between Athens and Sparta.

LIBERAL HEGEMONY/PRIMACY VS. BALANCE OF POWER/RESTRAINT

![A screenshot of a black screen Description automatically
generated](media/image4.png){width="6.0in"
height="1.5493055555555555in"}

A careful reading of Thucydides shows that he inclines toward the latter
view. Power maximization strategies are unsustainable because they tempt
powerful states to overreach, as Athens did in Sicily in Books VI and
VII. Given that propensity, other actors will balance against it, as do
Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian League in Book I, the
Sicilian Greek colonies in Books VI and VII, and dissatisfied members of
the Athenian empire in Book VIII. Thucydides is also skeptical that
benign hegemony is a stable situation long-term. Athens, which led the
Greeks against the Persians and founded the Delian League as a voluntary
alliance, soon gave way to the tyranny that reached its nadir at the
Melian Dialogue in Book V. Given that, Thucydides' message, while not
identical to a restrained balance of power realism, seems most
compatible with it.30

Such a reading of Thucydides suggests U.S. efforts to maintain its
hegemonic position, either unilaterally or through popular consent, are
bound to fail.31 The post-Cold War "unipolar moment" is an artifact of
the sudden and unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar system. By
virtue of its large population and high level of economic growth, China
is soon to replace the Soviet Union as another pole in the twenty-first
century international system. The interesting question now is not how
much longer unipolarity will last but whether it will be replaced with a
bipolar or multipolar system. And if it in fact turns out to be bipolar,
why would not structural theory lead us to see how it might be
stable---defined in terms of the absence of great power war---in the
same way the Cold War was?32

SHARE OF GLOBAL GDP (MER)

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically

height="2.3270833333333334in"}

[The U.S. commanded an outsized **share** of the **global economy**
after World War II, but in recent years, China's rise has moved its
economy closer to **parity**.]{.underline}

One of [the most important causes of hegemonic **wars** in]{.underline}
the [wake of power transitions is the "**security
dilemma**]{.underline}," the ubiquitous yet unintended dynamic in which
the efforts one state takes to ensure its security invariably undermine
that of other states.33 [While in an anarchical international system,
the [security dilemma can]{.mark} **never be eliminated**]{.underline},
it [can [be **mitigated**]{.mark} in many cases]{.underline} by the
policies states embrace. Thucydides thinks the Peloponnesian War results
from the breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta and
he applauds Pericles' efforts to try to reestablish it through
restraint.

HOW TO BALANCE THE DRAGON

Not only is [a **[balance of power]{.mark}**
strategy]{.underline}---like offshore balancing or restraint---[less
likely to **exacerbate** the **security dilemma**]{.underline}, [it
[is]{.mark} **eminently** more [**feasible** and]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
better [serve American **security**]{.mark} and prosperity
**interests**.]{.underline} Both offshore balancing and restraint are
based upon balance of power theories of international relations. Where
they differ is on the specific values of the variables in the strategic
equation (does current technology favor offense or defense, the specific
geography involved, the strength of the adversary, and the capabilities
of the other members of the balancing coalition?) that would lead us to
think the United States, or any other hegemon, needs to take a more or
less active role in balancing or whether they can rely more on the
efforts of the other states in its coalition.34

As Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War suggests, a balance of
power approach by the United States in its contemporary rivalry with
China will be more effective and less destabilizing. [The key **reason**
it will do so is [it **builds** upon]{.mark} a number of
well-established facts about how **[international politics]{.mark}
operates**, which we have known for more than **2,500
years**.]{.underline}35 First, in most cases, [states balance against
**threats**, rather than **bandwagoning**,]{.underline}\--throwing their
lot in with a stronger state in hopes that fealty rather than military
capability will preserve their security.36 [[As China grows more
**powerful**]{.mark} and **assertive**, states closest to it are feeling
a greater sense of peril.]{.underline} [Their [response will be]{.mark}
to seek ways to mitigate that threat by **[counterbalancing]{.mark}**
it, particularly in concert with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.
A less forward and assertive U.S. posture will not only mitigate the
security dilemma with China but also dampen common pathologies of
balancing such as buck-passing by allies to the larger power and
otherwise under-providing for their own security. The common problem
behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the propensity of
actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them against its
consequences.37

GEOGRAPHICAL CONSTRAINTS ON CHINA'S MARITIME POWER

![A map of the world Description automatically
generated](media/image6.png){width="6.0in"
height="3.7784722222222222in"}

To China's east, the first and second island chains, formed by the
various islands of the East and South China Seas, create natural
bottlenecks and hamper China's ability to project power across the
Pacific. Likewise, the Himalayas, combined with the nuclear capabilities
of China's neighbors, impacts China's reach into South Asia.

Second, **[[geography matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While power
degrades as a function of distance it also is diluted by **dense
forests**, high **mountain ranges**, and especially **wide bodies of
water**.]{.underline}38 The **[U.S.-China
[rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in contrast to the Cold War with the
Soviet Union, [[will be waged across]{.mark} wide
**[moats]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than contiguous borders, [so it
is even [less likely to **deteriorate** into]{.mark} **hegemonic
[war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Taiwan, for example, is further from
mainland China than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about
the same distance Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these
relatively short distances, neither was ever successfully invaded.

Third, it is true the United States opened a considerable gap in nuclear
capability between itself and other major nuclear powers, such as Russia
and especially China, that leads some to believe that the United States
could fight and win a nuclear war, especially with the latter.39 But
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} that both the United States and China have
[substantial [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Nuclear
Revolution [should]{.underline} further [**[reduce]{.mark}** the
[chances]{.mark} of major war]{.underline} between them, in much the
same way it kept the Cold War from turning hot.40 Indeed, [even when the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates had an even **greater nuclear
advantage** over the Soviet Union]{.underline} than it has over China
today, and in the face of multiple serious crises, [it neve[r
**executed** a pre-emptive]{.mark} nuclear first
**[strike]{.mark}**.]{.underline}41

Fourth, states' strategic choices matter, particularly in how they
choose to arm themselves, and that will continue to be true in the
twenty-first century. Many fret that recent Chinese investments in
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) technologies make it harder for the
United States to continue to project power close to China. However,
these same technologies could also bolster America's beleaguered allies
in the region.42 To defeat them militarily, China will have to project
power across water, always a dicey proposition, but one made even harder
now if U.S. allies in the region invest in their own A2/AD technologies.

Finally, and most important, we should keep in mind that
[[despite]{.mark} the power [transition]{.mark} that is taking place,
the United States still wields **considerable** actual and latent
**power** compared to China. ]{.underline}43 Even if it is challenged in
the East Asian region, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
nonetheless [retains]{.mark} what Barry Posen calls "the **[command of
the commons]{.mark}**" globally.44]{.underline}

[There are]{.underline} a number of **[[formidable
restraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in place to keep the
peace]{.underline}. The United States has worked hard over the decades
to build these barriers---often as part of the very engagement strategy
that Mearsheimer criticizes. [These bulwarks have [helped preserve
peace]{.mark} and promote prosperity [for]{.mark}]{.underline} the last
[**[70 years]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} they [are **still strong
enough**]{.mark}]{.underline} to prevent a **[[U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although [accidents or
incidents]{.underline} connected to military brinkmanship may occur,
they [would **almost certainly not**]{.underline} lead [to a wider
**[war]{.mark}**. That [would require]{.mark}]{.underline} something
exceedingly unlikely: [[the **simultaneous failure of every
restraint**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

First, [bilateral [diplomacy would have to **break
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engagement is the opposite of estrangement,
which describes the absence of U.S.-Chinese relations from 1949 to 1972.
The purpose of engagement is to forestall misperceptions, provide
reassurance, and prevent conflict. It is true that diplomacy and
communication between China and the United States have been anemic for
the past five years. And it is difficult to discern authoritative policy
amid the current cacophony of diplomatic posturing on Twitter and
elsewhere, creating an environment ripe for confusion and overreaction.
But these deficiencies are not structural; they can be remedied. If
top-level leaders in both countries consistently communicate and work to
reduce public posturing, as they should, then the diplomatic barriers to
war can be reinforced.

For a war to break out, [the international system would also have to
fail. China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are
connected to [a **global network** of]{.mark} [**countries** and
**institutions**]{.mark} that [have]{.mark}]{.underline} a stake---in
some cases, [[an **existential stake**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in
**preventing conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} between these two
countries. Almost [**[every government]{.mark}** and **institution** on
the globe [would be **grievously damaged**]{.mark} by a U.S.-Chinese
war]{.underline}, and so [they [**all** would]{.mark} try to
[prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} an imminent [[conflict through
**diplomatic pressure**, **mediation**, or]{.underline}]{.mark} acts of
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as denying overflight and
basing rights. Critics may be quick to deny the influence of others in
heading off a major-power clash. But in the current international
system, there is no way for either side to emerge victorious, and those
outside China and the United States would see this most clearly.

[Then there is the restraint created by **globalization**]{.underline}.
Mearsheimer argues that it was a catastrophic mistake for the United
States to help China grow wealthy, as its resulting strength will
inevitably lead it to challenge the United States. But it is also
plausible that [[the]{.mark} inextricably [integrated]{.mark} nature of
the [global economy]{.mark}, and **specifically** of the Chinese and
U.S. economies, [makes **any war unwinnable**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
thus [acts as a **deterrent to conflict**]{.underline}. It is true, as
critics will point out, that economic dependencies failed to prevent
[World War I]{.underline}. But [the economic relations of the early
twentieth century were **nothing like** the **complex entanglements** of
today's international economic system. In]{.underline} the case of
[China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [they
[create]{.mark}]{.underline} a situation of **[mutual [assured economic
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Another restraint is **public opinion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
on the U.S. side. [[Politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United
States respond to various incentives, but they [**[cannot
ignore]{.mark}** the sentiments of their [voters]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And [[after a **20-year fight** against terrorism, the]{.mark} American
[public is]{.mark}]{.underline} decidedly [[**wary** of]{.mark}
**protracted** and **costly [overseas conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
If U.S. policymakers appeared poised for a conflict with China, one
would also expect that the press, having learned its lesson from the war
in Iraq, would perform its watchdog function, question the official
narratives, and activate public concern.

[All these barriers]{.underline} should work to [prevent]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline}. [But if they **somehow didn't**, [there is a
**final fail-safe**]{.mark} that is **even harder** to imagine not
working]{.underline}: military **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Taiwan is the most likely issue over which a U.S.-Chinese war could
break out. But [the quantity and quality of [the weaponry]{.mark} on
both sides [translates to **certain catastrophic losses**]{.mark} for
**all**, which should provide a sufficient deterrent to
war]{.underline}. And because the devastation of a conflict over Taiwan
would spiral out of control quickly, one cannot rule out the use of
nuclear weapons. Strange as it may sound, that is good news: just as the
nuclear age prevented direct military conflict between the Soviet Union
and the United States for more than 40 years, so it should between
[[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, both of which [[are
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}-armed [[powers with]{.mark} survivable
[second-strike capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although China has
many fewer missiles and warheads than the United States---something
China is working on remedying---the doctrine of
**[m]{.underline}**utually **[a]{.underline}**ssured
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [still operates]{.underline}. **[[The
balance of terror holds]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### !/D\-\--AT: Taiwan War\-\--1NC

#### No [Taiwan]{.underline} war.

**Bremmer 23'** -- Ian, President of Eurasia Group, Foreign Affairs
Columnist and Editor-at-Large at TIME, Ph.D. in Political Science from
Stanford University. "Why China Won\'t Invade Taiwan Anytime Soon",
TIME, https://time.com/6270599/china-invade-taiwan, 04-12-2023

All that said, [the actual [risk of]{.mark} imminent [Chinese military
action against Taiwan]{.mark} remains [**low**. Beijing **always
flexes**]{.mark} military muscle]{.underline} when highest-level U.S.
and Taiwanese officials meet face to face. Yet, though Speaker
McCarthy's visit with Taiwan's president marks the highest-level
U.S.-Taiwan meeting on US soil since 1979, China's latest response was
less militarily threatening than its reaction to last summer's visit to
Taiwan by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- and Beijing is well aware that
Washington will notice that.

More importantly, [[Xi is spending]{.mark} considerable
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline} these days [on playing a larger role on the
global stage]{.underline}, particularly [[as a **peacemaker**]{.mark}.
He]{.underline} has [offered a 12-point peace plan for
Ukraine]{.underline} he hopes will encourage others to see China as a
global mediator, even if this particular plan has no chance of success.
This past weekend, [Xi [welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline} French President
Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} and European Commission Chairman
Ursula Von der Leyen to Beijing for discussion of the Ukraine war and
the future of China's relations with Europe more broadly. Though Xi
didn't promise his European guests to lean harder on Russia, [the
Chinese and French governments issued a joint statement pledging they
would work together to bring Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to
the]{.underline} bargaining [table]{.underline}.

[This [follows]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkable [[visit]{.mark} to
China of the foreign ministers [of]{.mark}]{.underline} Middle East
rivals [[Iran and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, where they agreed
under China's mediation to improve their historically contentious
relationship. Most importantly, just days ago[, Taiwan's former
president [Ma]{.mark} Ying-jeou became the first current or former
Taiwanese leader to [visit the mainland]{.mark}]{.underline} since
Taiwan broke away in 1949, and during his visit he spoke of the "common
inheritance of blood, language, history and culture" between the two
sides, raising hopes in Beijing that reunification can still be achieved
without risking a potentially catastrophic conflict. In short,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [wants to be]{.underline} (at least
perceived as) **[a peacemaker]{.underline}**, and though Taiwan's future
remains of far more importance to him that any of these issues, [China's
president is **[unlikely to reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline} all these
[**[diplomatic victories]{.mark}** by stumbling into a costly
war]{.underline}.

There are more basic reasons why China is unlikely to move against
Taiwan soon. [Xi has [watched]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully
[as]{.underline} Russia's President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [provided a vivid demonstration
of]{.underline} just [how [**unpredictable, costly**, and
**humiliating**]{.mark} an ill-conceived [war]{.mark} can be. Taiwan,
backed with generations of]{.underline} sophisticated and powerful
[American weapons, has been preparing]{.underline} for a possible
Chinese invasion [even longer than Ukraine]{.underline} has prepped for
a full-frontal assault from Russia, and [[given]{.mark} the]{.underline}
complete [[lack of]{.mark} Chinese [combat experience]{.mark}
over]{.underline} the past [44 years, [Xi]{.mark}
[understands]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[the risks of [Pyrrhic
victory]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[or]{.underline}** even of
**[defeat]{.underline}** -- **[are real]{.underline}**. At a time [when
China is [emerging from]{.mark}]{.underline} the world's most draconian
lockdown and [its worst economic [slowdown]{.mark} in decades, Xi is
[likely to be **extra careful**]{.mark} **about the fights he
picks**]{.underline}. At least for now.

There's also the critical issue of semiconductors. About [90 percent
of]{.underline} the world's most sophisticated [computer chips are made
in Taiwan]{.underline}. Aware of the risk this creates, China, the U.S.,
and others are working as quickly as possible to lessen the risk of
economic catastrophe that would result if that production were
dramatically slowed or even halted, but self-sufficiency in chip
production is years away for every country. [China is [loath to
risk]{.mark} conflict that would leave [its economy]{.mark} without
access to the]{.underline} 21st century's [most important economic
resource]{.underline}.

One day, China may invade Taiwan, triggering a war with global
implications. But that day isn't soon. When and if it does, the [timing
will be determined by]{.underline} China's leader, not as the result of
any diplomatic provocation, but by his own calculation of [benefit and
cost]{.underline}. For now, it's still possible to hope that **[[cooler
heads]{.mark} can]{.underline}** one day **[[find a diplomatic
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to avert a war that would have
disastrous implications far beyond Asia.

[In the West and parts of Asia, concern is]{.underline}
**[mounting]{.underline}** [that China might invade Taiwan to distract
from]{.underline} **[mounting domestic challenges]{.underline}** [or
because Chinese leaders imagine that their **window of opportunity** to
seize the island **is closing**.]{.underline} Facing an economic
slowdown and rising unemployment, some analysts argue, Beijing might be
tempted to launch a military offensive to rally popular support. In
January 2023, for instance, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu,
speculated that Chinese President Xi Jinping might create an external
crisis "to divert domestic attention or to show to the Chinese that he
has accomplished something." Ot[her analysts warn of an impending war
because China's rise is slowing.]{.underline} In their view, Beijing
might try to seize the opportunity to use force against Taiwan while it
has the advantage. Admiral Mike Gilday, chief of U.S. naval operations,
suggested in October 2022 that China could try to take Taiwan as early
as 2022 or 2023. Other U.S. officials, including Mark Milley, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and William Burns, the director
of the CIA, have cautioned that Xi has not yet decided to invade Taiwan.
But there is growing concern among some Western security analysts and
policymakers that once the People's Liberation Army (PLA) believes it
has the military capability to invade Taiwan and hold the United States
at bay, Xi will order an invasion. [[Fears that China will]{.mark} soon
[invade]{.mark} Taiwan **[are]{.mark} [overblown]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There is **little evidence**]{.underline} [that Chinese leaders see a
closing window for action]{.underline}. Such fears appear to be driven
more by Washington's assessments of its own military vulnerabilities
than by Beijing's risk-reward calculus. Historically, Chinese leaders
have not started wars to divert attention from domestic challenges, and
they continue to favor using measures short of conflict to achieve their
objectives. If anything, problems at home have moderated Chinese foreign
policy, and Chinese popular opinion has tended to reward government
bluster and displays of resolve that do not lead to open conflict. [If
Western [policymakers **exaggerate**]{.mark} **the [risk]{.mark}** of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan, they might **inadvertently create a
self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.underline}. Instead of worrying that
Beijing will gin up a foreign crisis to bolster its standing at home or
assuming that Beijing feels pressured to invade in the near term, the
United States should focus on arresting---or at least decelerating---the
action-reaction spiral that has steadily ratcheted up tensions and made
a crisis more likely. That does not mean halting efforts to bolster
Taiwan's resilience to Chinese coercion or to diversify the United
States' defense posture in the region. But it does mean avoiding
needless confrontation and identifying reciprocal steps that Washington
and Beijing could take to lower the temperature. The hard but crucial
task for U.S. policymakers is to thread the needle between deterrence
and provocation. Symbolic displays of resolve, unconditional commitments
to defend Taiwan, and pledges of a surge in U.S. military power in the
region could stray too far toward the latter, inadvertently provoking
the very conflict U.S. policymakers seek to deter. WAG THE DOG?
[Although the logic of diversionary aggression has **an intuitive
appeal**]{.underline}, [there is little reason to think that domestic
challenges will **tempt China's leadership**]{.underline} [to launch a
war abroad.]{.underline} In a 2008 review of [[cross-national
studies]{.underline}]{.mark} of international conflict, the scholars
Matthew [Baum and]{.underline} Philip [Potter
[found]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[little]{.mark} consistent
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} world [leaders
starting]{.mark} military [hostilities to whip up]{.mark} domestic
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[authoritarian leaders]{.mark}
may be]{.underline} **[less likely]{.underline}** [than democratic ones
to]{.underline} **[initiate crises]{.underline}** in [the wake of
domestic unrest]{.underline} because [they [have]{.mark} **greater
[latitude]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to repress]{.mark} their
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}, the political scientist Chris Gelpi has
found. And [[rather than embark on]{.mark} risky [military
adventures]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leaders facing domestic
challenges]{.underline} often **[choose other means]{.underline}** [to
quell discontent, including]{.underline} **[working with other
states]{.underline}** to address threats from within---for instance, by
settling border disputes to calm unrest on their frontiers---[or
**resorting to repression**. [China's]{.mark} [response]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} once-in-a-generation protests against its [draconian
COVID]{.mark}-[19]{.mark}]{.underline} restrictions late last year
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a [case in point]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[After demonstrators took to the streets]{.underline} in dozens of
cities carrying sheets of blank paper---symbols of resistance in the
face of censorship---[[the]{.mark} Chinese [government]{.mark} **did not
seek**]{.underline} [to deflect attention]{.underline} from domestic
discontent with aggressive foreign policy measures. Instead,
[it]{.underline} **[[eased]{.mark} its COVID-19
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [detained and interrogated
protesters]{.underline}, [and continued its post-pandemic efforts to
reassure foreign investors. [Chinese leaders have given]{.mark}
**[few]{.mark} [signs]{.mark}** that domestic [insecurity]{.mark} [might
**prompt**]{.mark} **them to [lash out]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
Taiwan.]{.underline} On the contrary, Xi [and [the]{.mark}
[C]{.mark}]{.underline}hinese [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommunist
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty leadership [have [sought to
**project**]{.mark} **an image of [confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[patience]{.underline}** [in the face of growing
international risks and challenges]{.underline}. Despite pessimism in
China about trends in public opinion that show Taiwan pulling away from
the mainland politically and culturally, Xi told the CCP's 20th Party
Congress in October 2022 that "the wheels of history are rolling on
toward China's reunification." Xi has sought to project an image of
confidence and patience. [Historically, Chinese leaders have tended
to]{.underline} **[temper their foreign policy]{.underline}** [during
times of domestic turmoil.]{.underline} Sometimes, [they have engaged in
**harsh rhetoric**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[saber
rattling]{.underline}**, [but they have **only rarely**]{.underline}
[launched military operations]{.underline} in such periods. Even
Chairman Mao Zedong, who ordered the shelling of offshore islands in
1958, sought to mobilize the Chinese population while avoiding an
outright war over Taiwan, warning that China must only fight battles it
is sure of winning. [According to]{.underline} the political scientist
M. Taylor [Fravel]{.underline}, [China has **compromised in 15 of the
17** territorial disputes]{.underline} it has settled with its neighbors
since 1949---most of them during periods of regime insecurity arising
from domestic political challenges, including unrest in Tibet and
Xinjiang in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tiananmen Square
protests in 1989, and renewed unrest in Xinjiang in the early 1990s. In
an analysis of Beijing's behavior in militarized interstate disputes
between 1949 and 1992, moreover, the political scientist Alastair Iain
[[Johnston found]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[no
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between]{.mark} domestic [unrest
and]{.mark} [China's use of force]{.mark} externally]{.underline}." If
anything, [the [frequency]{.mark} of China's]{.underline} [involvement
in militarized]{.underline} [interstate]{.underline}
[disputes]{.underline} **[[declined when]{.mark} domestic [unrest
increased]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On the whole, in other words, [Chinese
leaders have done the]{.underline} **[opposite]{.underline}** [of what
many analysts are warning:]{.underline} [they have sought to **reduce
external tensions**]{.underline} in order to tackle domestic challenges
from a position of greater strength while attempting to deter foreign
efforts to exploit internal tensions. [Beijing's behavior in the East
and South China Seas has followed this pattern]{.underline}. During two
flare-ups with Tokyo in the 1990s over the island chain known as the
Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, for instance, Chinese leaders
quashed expressions of popular antipathy toward Japan with the aim of
preserving economic ties with Tokyo, according to the international
relations scholars Phillip Saunders and Erica Downs. And the political
scientist Andrew Chubb has shown that between 1970 and 2015, Chinese
leaders tended to be less aggressive at sea during periods of internal
strife. [When Beijing did act assertively in these maritime territorial
disputes, it did so **mainly to thwart perceived challenges** with new
capabilities, **not to distract** from heightened **domestic
insecurity**.]{.underline} BARK NOT BITE Claims that Beijing is looking
for opportunities to lash out for domestic political purposes aren't
just wrong. They are dangerous because they imply that U.S. actions have
no bearing on China's calculus on Taiwan and that the only way to deter
Beijing from diversionary aggression is to deny it the ability to
prevail in such an endeavor. [Domestic considerations and the military
balance of power are **not the only factors**]{.underline} [Xi will
weigh when deciding whether to attack Taiwan]{.underline}. Even if he
prefers to avoid a near-term conflict and believes that China's military
prospects will improve over time, he might still order a military
operation if he and other Chinese leaders perceive a sharp increase in
the risk that Taiwan could be lost. As Fravel has shown, China has often
used military force to counter perceived challenges to its sovereignty
claims in territorial and maritime disputes. Such challenges, including
U.S. actions that endorse Taiwan as an independent state or suggest that
Washington might be on the cusp of restoring a formal alliance with the
island, might trigger such a reaction from China. Even so, Beijing has
less risky ways to respond to perceived provocations, including rhetoric
and actions that could burnish its nationalist credentials without
escalating to military conflict. As I have previously argued in Foreign
Affairs, [[China's leaders]{.mark} frequently [engage]{.mark} in
[rhetorical bluster to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[appease]{.mark}**
domestic [audiences]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **minimize** the popular
**costs** of not **using military force**]{.underline}. [[They
ma]{.mark}y also [choose]{.mark} from a variety of escalatory [measures
**short of war**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to signal resolve and impose
costs]{.underline} on Taiwan, including military, economic, and
diplomatic efforts to squeeze the island and deter it from pulling away
from the mainland. Behavior of this sort should not be mistaken for
preparations for war. KEEP CALM In any society, there are people who go
looking for a fight. But [among the ranks of China's top leaders, those
people still appear to be **less influential**]{.underline} than those
who recognize that it is better to win without fighting. Although Xi
warned in 2021 that China would take "decisive measures" if provoked by
"forces for Taiwan independence," the CCP reiterated in 2022 that
"peaceful reunification" remains its "first choice." [Even the hawkish
Qiao Liang]{.underline}, a retired major general in the Chinese air
force, [has cautioned against the tide of nationalist agitation for
action against Taiwan]{.underline}. "China's ultimate goal is not the
reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national
rejuvenation---so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,"
Qiao said in a May 2020 interview. He went on to warn that taking Taiwan
by force would be "too costly" and should not be Beijing's top priority.

#### \--Experts [conclude]{.underline} we are [years away]{.underline}

**Stavridis 22'** -- James, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. A retired
U.S. Navy admiral, former supreme allied commander of NATO, and dean
emeritus of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University, he is vice chairman of global affairs at the Carlyle
Group. "A US-China War Over Taiwan Isn\'t Happening Anytime Soon",
Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-09/a-us-china-war-over-taiwan-isn-t-happening-anytime-soon>,
08-09-2022

[[Based on]{.mark} many [**years** of **engagement**]{.mark} with the
**Chinese** around the Pacific both [**operationally** and
**diplomatically**]{.mark}]{.underline}, I believe [[we are **years
away** from]{.mark} any potential [**military move** by Beijing against
Taipei]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it is particularly
[**unlikely** to happen]{.mark} in the immediate future.]{.underline}
There are several reasons.

First, [events in [Ukraine]{.mark} are **likely** to [give]{.mark}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping **[pause]{.mark}**, not
encouragement]{.underline}. He must be asking himself, "I wonder if my
generals and admirals are as bad as those Russians appear to be?" Xi was
probably assured by Putin, when they met at the Olympics in February,
that this would be a sharp, short war and that the Russians would have
full control of Ukraine before the West could get its collective boots
on. Things turned out very differently for the Kremlin.

[The [Chinese **military**]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar in many ways to
Russia's, [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} even the level of [**[combat
experience]{.mark}** the [Russians had]{.mark} in Afghanistan, Chechnya
and Syria]{.underline}, and in the previous invasions of Ukraine and
Georgia.

A second reason for Chinese hesitancy is [[uncertainty about the
**Taiwanese**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Would they [**fold** or
**fight**?]{.underline} [Polling is never fully **reliable**, but [all
**indications**]{.mark} are that the **[Taiwan]{.mark}**ese have a
strong **sense** of national **identity** [and are unlikely to simply
**roll over**]{.mark} when the first wave of Chinese missiles strike on
the island]{.underline}. (Beijing gave a preview of its muscle in
the [exercises](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-09/(previewed%20this%20past%20weekend%20in%20the%20exercises%20responding%20to%20the%20Pelosi%20visit)) responding
to the Pelosi visit.)

President Tsai Ing-wen is a steely leader --- she's not unlike Ukrainian
leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy --- and my assessment is that the Taiwanese
will fight, and fight hard. The geography of the island --- mountain and
forest --- is a nightmare for an invader, especially one that must mount
the assault by sea.

Third, [Beijing is watching the [**alignment** of]{.mark} the **[Western
democracies]{.mark}** across Europe]{.underline} and the Far East in
enacting ~~crippling~~ sanctions on Russia, [[causing Moscow
to **default**]{.mark} on its debt for the first time in more than a
century]{.underline}. Almost all Western
corporations [decamped](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/22/russia-economy-sanctions-myths-ruble-business/) from
Moscow, helping cause a collapse in imports, and few look to be going
back anytime soon. The NordStream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany
will have nothing but air whistling through its long tubes for the
foreseeable future, and the Europeans are making strides toward [energy
independence](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/world/europe/russia-gas-cuts-putin-eu.html) from
Moscow.

Sure, the Chinese will say to themselves, our economy is too big to
sanction, and they would be largely correct. But could the West produce
real pain-inducing sanctions on specific sectors? Absolutely. And at a
moment when the Chinese economy has been slowed by the ravages of
zero-Covid lockdowns, this prospect is particularly unappetizing.

Fourth, as the old saw goes, "all politics are local," and [[Xi has
a]{.mark} very [**delicate political** situation]{.mark} before
him]{.underline}. At the 20th Communist Party Congress late in the fall,
he will almost certainly be given a third five-year term. It is a
remarkable achievement, vaulting him into the company of Mao Zedong and
Deng Xiaoping. [He [does not want a]{.mark} major [conflict]{.mark} with
the US [to interfere with this **anointment**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even
[after he]{.mark} fully [consolidates control]{.mark} it seems
[**unlikely** he **would**]{.mark} quickly **manufacture** a crisis that
could **[crater the global economy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Finally, [China's **military** and **political** [leaders]{.mark}
probably **assess** that they [are not]{.mark} (quite) [ready]{.mark}
for a full-scale war with the US.]{.underline} They have a [[**backlog**
of military **capability**]{.mark} they will want [to]{.mark} fully
[integrate]{.mark} into the **P**eople's **L**iberation
**A**rmy]{.underline}: a new strategic nuclear force, nuclear-powered
warships (notably aircraft carriers), hypersonic missiles, improved
offensive cyberwarfare techniques, and a far better satellite network
for reconnaissance and actual combat in space.

#### [--Ukraine shows invasions are difficult for Beijing]{.underline}

**Chung 22'** -- Lawrence, covers major news in Taiwan, ranging from
presidential and parliament elections to killer earthquakes and
typhoons. Most of his reports focus on Taiwan's relations with China,
specifically on the impact and possible developments of cross-strait
relations under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and
mainland-friendly Kuomintang governments. Before starting work at the
South China Morning Post in 2006, he wrote for Reuters and AFP for more
than 12 years. "Ukraine war lessons make attack on Taiwan unlikely:
security chief", South China Morning Post,
<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3172120/ukraine-war-lessons-make-attack-taiwan-unlikely-security-chief>,
03-28-2022

The [[head
of [Taiwan's](https://www.scmp.com/topics/taiwan-0?module=inline&pgtype=article) **National
Security Bureau**]{.underline}]{.mark} said the [[Russian
**experience**]{.mark} in Ukraine]{.underline} has [[made it unlikely
that **Beijing** will send **forces** to the]{.mark} **self-ruled
[island]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the remainder of President Tsai
Ing-wen's term.

But Chen Ming-tong warned legislators that the island must not let down
its guard, because any attack from the mainland would be an all-out
operation.

Chen was [responding to **questions** during Monday's legislature
**session** on whether the **P**eople's **L**iberation **A**rmy would
follow **Russia's lead**
in [Ukraine](https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine?module=inline&pgtype=article) to
attack Taiwan]{.underline}.

Beijing, [which considers the **island** as part of its
**territory**,]{.underline} has been ramping up pressure on the island
since Tsai refused to accept the one-China principle. Warplanes fly
towards Taiwan almost daily and PLA exercises have been staged near the
island.

Wen Yu-hsia, from the main Taiwanese opposition party the Kuomintang
(KMT), asked Chen to evaluate the chances of an attack, adding that
"even the US Indo-Pacific commander does not rule out the possibility".

Wen was referring to an interview with Admiral [John
Aquilino](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3171203/china-has-fully-militarised-islands-south-china-sea-threatening?module=inline&pgtype=article) published
by the Financial Times on Friday, in which he said the Russian invasion
of Ukraine showed Asian nations must take the possibility of a PLA
attack on Taiwan seriously.

Aquilino said he was concerned about Beijing's increasing pressure on
the island, and the need to be prepared for any eventuality. "[As of
five months ago, nobody would have **predicted** the war in **Ukraine**,
and the number one lesson from it should be that anything could
happen]{.underline}."

But Chen [said [Beijing had]{.mark} definitely [**learned** from
**Russia's experience** and would not]{.mark} "**[rashly]{.mark}**"
[send **forces** to **Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan and it has
long been an open plot for it to unify Taiwan ever since 1949," he said,
referring to the end of the civil war, when KMT forces fled to the
island in defeat.

Chen said the Ukraine war had certainly allowed the Communist Party to
understand it should not make any move without careful consideration --
and once it decided to strike, it must be an all-out operation.

He said [Russia had made a lot of **mistakes**, which included starting
its **invasion** without an **organised plan**]{.underline}, and that
Beijing would do all it could to avoid making the same errors if it
chose to attack the island

[I can tell [in the **next three years**]{.mark} of the remaining tenure
of President Tsai, [**Beijing** is unlikely to send **forces to attack
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said, adding his assessment was made
from his professional viewpoint.

"But we must not relax our vigilance and must be well prepared
militarily and once they attack us we must counter-attack. We are not a
limp chicken doing nothing."

Expanding on what other lessons had been learned from the war, Chen said
Beijing had been surprised at the success of international sanctions,
including taking Russia out of the Swift banking system, pushed through
with the support of Western allies.

"[Beijing \[will be\] more **cautious** in making any move \[against
Taiwan\] as evidenced by the intervention of **foreign forces** in the
Ukraine war]{.underline}," he said.

He noted that while the US did not send forces to help Ukraine -- for
fear of triggering a third world war -- its other military and monetary
aid was another restraint on the movements of Russian troops.

Chen said the [US **decision** to help Ukraine was **made** without the
domestic legal requirement that **underpinned** Washington's
**commitment**]{.underline} to ensure Taiwan's defence capability
against Beijing.

"[We have [the **T**]{.mark}aiwan **[R]{.mark}**elations
**[A]{.mark}**ct which \[US President Joe\] Biden has used to
consolidate ties with us, and this [would make Beijing think carefully
before sending forces to attack]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline}," he noted.

Islamabad : **[There is a need to study the causes of proxy wars, and
what are the potential impacts of such wars on the overall conflict.
These thoughts in a daylong [international seminar on]{.mark} 'Strategic
Dimensions of Peace and [Conflict in]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Asia
and **[[the Middle East]{.mark},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace
Studies (PIPS]{.underline}**), an Islamabad-based think tank,
**[[participated by prominent]{.mark} national and [international
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Prof]{.underline}**. Shahram **[Akbarzadeh]{.underline}**, Deakin
University, Australia, **[[argued]{.mark} there is significant gap in
the literature on non-state actors]{.underline}**. He called for
empirical research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the
topic, so as to mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular
South Asia and Middle East.

Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and proxy wars: PIPS
director Muhammad Amir Rana said **[non-state actors often evoke
memories of violent elements]{.underline}**. This despite that as per
definition, non-state actors include organizations working for human
rights.

Prof. Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy,
NUST, said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no
universal agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances
behind such wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the
phenomena of conventional war itself.

Speakers noted **[[proxy wars are instruments of state
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As to why states go for it, it was argued,
**[it is [because they are]{.mark} often [cheap]{.mark} undertaking to
change the status quo]{.underline}**.

Participants noted over the decades, **[much of the [conflict involves
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Interstate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}, on the other hand, **[[has
declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent times, he said
**[[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Dr. Ibrahim **[Fraihat]{.underline}**, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, **[termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two
parties, though one of them is not directly involved]{.underline}**.
This way, **[domestic conflicts are escalated by external power
intervention]{.underline}**. At the same time, proxy war, if unresolved,
can take the shape of conventional war, the most significant example was
of Vietnam War. **[[In contemporary times]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
lamented, **[[the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

William Gueriache, Associate Professor American University in the
Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states support open diplomacy and
multilateralism. Yet the survival of patronage has paved the way for
foreign intervention during conflicts in the whole Middle East.

Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at the Arab Center for
Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted multiplicity of actors
involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother of conflicts in the
region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless patron states
achieve their interests.

Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor National Defence University Islamabad
focused on the apprehension of Pakistan about India's involvement in
Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's uneasy relationship with Kabul
reinforces a perception of encirclement while growing US-India strategic
cooperation further aggravates these apprehensions.

**[Dr]{.underline}**. Muhammad Riaz **[Shad]{.underline}**, National
University of Modern Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[[fighting
through proxies gives states an opportunity of
deniability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[the [diversification of]{.mark} global [energy]{.mark} markets [has
weakened oil]{.mark} as a driver]{.underline}** of U.S. policy.
**[[During the Cold War, traditional]{.mark} state]{.underline}**-based
**[[threats pushed]{.mark} the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to play [a]{.mark} major
[role]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Middle East. That role involved not
only ensuring the stable supply of energy to Western markets but also
working to prevent the spread of communist influence and tamping down
the Arab-Israeli conflict so as to help stabilize friendly states. These
**[[efforts were]{.mark} largely [successful]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Beginning in the 1970s, the United States nudged Egypt out of the
pro-Soviet camp, oversaw the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and
solidified its hegemony in the region. **[Despite
challenges]{.underline}** from Iran after its 1979 revolution and from
Saddam Hussein's Iraq throughout the 1990s, **[U.S. dominance was
never]{.underline}** seriously **[in question. The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[contained]{.mark} the Arab-[Israel]{.mark}i conflict, [countered
Saddam]{.mark}'s bid to gain territory]{.underline}** through force
**[in the]{.underline}** 1990--91 **[Gulf War, [and built a]{.mark}
seemingly permanent military [presence]{.mark} in the Gulf [that
deterred]{.mark}]{.underline}** Iran **[[and muffled disputes
among]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Gulf **[[Arab states. Thanks to]{.mark}
all [these]{.mark} efforts, the [chances of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
deliberate **[interstate [war]{.mark} in the Middle East
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps **[[lower]{.mark} now [than]{.mark}
at [any time in]{.mark} the past [50 years]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

For two reasons, however, such **[[clashes are unlikely to escalate
into]{.mark} all-out [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, **[since [Iran
and Israel do not share a border, it is difficult to see]{.mark} how the
[present hostilities]{.mark} could [spiral into]{.mark} a wide-ranging
[confrontation involving ground operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On
the other hand, if Iran chooses to involve its proxy Hezbollah in
Lebanon, which does share a border with Israel, matters would look quite
different, especially given Hezbollah's exceptional rocket arsenal. This
brings us to a second reason **[war is unlikely: [No party
regards]{.mark} a full-scale [conflict]{.mark} between Israel and Iran
[as]{.mark} in its [strategic]{.mark} interests---Israel and Iran
themselves don't, nor do the U.S. or Russia, or even Hezbollah and
Syria]{.underline}**. Hezbollah may be willing to send advisers and
soldiers to fight in Syria alongside the Shiite militias and the
Revolutionary Guard, but it's in no hurry to entangle Lebanon in the
conflict. In the recent Lebanese parliamentary elections, [Hezbollah
successfully campaigned on domestic issues. [It is doubtful Hezbollah
has]{.mark} much [interest in reprising its role as an Iranian
messenger]{.mark}, which is how it has been perceived by many in Lebanon
during the years of the civil war in Syria.]{.underline} What about
Syria? [[After seven years of civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}, just as
President Bashar al-Assad is at last regaining control of large swathes
of his country, [[Syria also has no interest in serving as the
battleground]{.mark} between Iran and Israel.]{.underline} Even so, as
of now[, [Assad]{.mark} also [needs the Iranian military]{.mark}
presence in order [to assure its survival. Iran]{.mark} meanwhile
[has]{.mark} enough [headaches]{.mark} [with its economy and with
the]{.mark} U.S. [withdrawal from the nuclear deal]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(There is no connection between the American withdrawal from the nuclear
accord and the escalation between Iran and Israel, however. The events
of the past few days have been years in the making, with or without the
nuclear deal, given Iran and Israel's mutually incompatible interests in
the region.) [And [Russia does not look favorably on]{.mark} the
deterioration of a place like [Syria, which is supposed to
generate]{.mark} [economic profits]{.mark} for Moscow through
investments in reconstruction.]{.underline} So what remains for Iran and
the Revolutionary Guards? Iran might adapt its "Yemen model"---support
for the Houthi rebels who launch missiles every few days at Iran's other
regional archenemy, Saudi Arabia---to the Syrian theater. Iran might
seek to challenge Israel from Syria by helping Shiite militias and
Hezbollah advisers establish cells that could launch rockets at Israel
without leaving Iranian fingerprints. In this way Tehran could avoid a
full-fledged war, while exhausting Israel with short but painful jabs
that would harm the country's economy. Yet there are obstacles to this
approach---[[Israel's]{.mark} exceptional [intelligence
capabilities]{.mark} in Syria [have]{.mark} more than once [frustrated
Iranian attempts to land]{.mark} such [blows]{.mark}.]{.underline}
