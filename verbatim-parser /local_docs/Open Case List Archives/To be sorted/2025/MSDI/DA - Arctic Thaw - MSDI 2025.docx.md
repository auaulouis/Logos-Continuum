## Notes

This DA argues that Arctic activity of any kind (literal activity --
people existing and operating in and around the Arctic) causes the
permafrost to start melting. The main link is black carbon, a nasty
particulate of combusted fossil fuels. Of course, the link is stronger
for some Affs than others (oil & gas vs research) but even the plans
that claim not to utilize fossil fuels or do anything "dirty" still have
to have [activity]{.underline} in and around the region; that means
ships, planes, vehicles, electricity being produced, etc., so all Affs
still link just from being [in]{.underline} the Arctic.

[Top Level]{.underline}

[Timeframe]{.underline}\-\--the tf push on impact calc is that now is
the time to prevent a lock-in to continuous thawing of the Arctic. Zhang
23 is worded a bit weird, but the context is that we risk an ice free
Arctic by 2050 and the authors describe "30 years before" as the time to
stop it; i.e., right now.

[UQ]{.underline}\-\--yes, the Arctic is thawing in the squo. But more
activity makes it worse and causes "abrupt" thaw (as opposed to the
squo's "gradual" thaw) which releases more GHGs from the ice, adding
more to the snowball.

[UQ]{.underline}\-\--yes, there are alt causes to black carbon. But
local emissions are way, way, way, worse (see Bennett 24). Black carbon
emissions in the southern latitudes won't travel up to the Arctic and
land as a black, sunlight absorbing particulate matter like what occurs
when ships and planes and cars emit them right onto the snow and ice.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nevertheless, [the most [impactful **black carbon emissions**
occur]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline} and high latitudes. [Black
carbon emissions [from]{.mark} **fossil fuel exploitation** and
**[exploration in and near the Arctic]{.mark}** are
growing.]{.underline} One study estimated that gas flaring accounts for
42% of the black carbon emitted in the Arctic annually.

There are several ways to address this problem, such as capturing rather
than flaring the gas. Still, [in a world where fossil fuel use needs to
be phased out rapidly, [continuing these **activities near the Arctic**
provides a double whammy to the **Arctic** and **global climate
system**]{.mark}, from greenhouse gas and **black carbon
emissions**.]{.underline}

[With at least one sea ice-free summer in the Arctic projected by 2050,
further increases in black carbon emissions from expanding **Arctic
shipping routes** are a major concern.]{.underline} Between 2013 and
2023, there was a 37% increase in unique ships entering Arctic waters.
[The Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme has
found that [even a **small rise of 1-2%** in]{.mark} shipping [traffic
could lead to a **surge** in Arctic black carbon emissions]{.mark}

Tipping Points

For centuries, imaginaries of the Arctic have rested on its pristine
whiteness. But [in the Anthropocene, human activities are sullying the
fantastical snow globe. Circulating in the atmosphere are
**light-absorbing particles (LAPs)** like **[black carbon]{.mark}**,
mineral dust, and volcanic ash, all of which can [cast a **pall** on the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 1815, the cataclysmic eruption of Tambora, an Indonesian volcano,
shot 150 cubic kilometers of ash, pumice, and other rocky debris into
the stratosphere. The eruption blocked solar radiation, spurred a
volcanic winter, and decreased the global temperature by 3°C. But the
Arctic warmed as less rain fell on North America, reducing the amount of
cold fresh water in the Atlantic that normally flowed north. Whalers'
reports of suddenly open, ice-free channels spurred the British
Admiralty to recommence its search for the Northwest Passage. Yet this
brief period of Arctic warming was short-lived; the channels refroze by
1818.

Two centuries later, [more of the Arctic is transforming into **open
water**---and this time, humans are to blame. The incomplete
**combustion** of **fossil fuels**, biofuel, and biomass is depositing
black carbon, or **soot**, across the Arctic. These fine [particulates
**absorb sunlight** and **release heat**]{.mark} into the atmosphere,
making them a **major contributor** to climate change. Black carbon is
especially pernicious in the Arctic: it significantly **lowers** the
**albedo**, or the proportion of reflected light, of the snow on which
it falls. [As ice and snow]{.mark} shrink and [melt, creating even
**more dark surfaces**, the **positive feedback loop accelerates
regional warming**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**Where** black carbon is released also **matters**. Particulates
emitted from wood-burning stoves in places like South Asia can affect
the Arctic, but those **emitted locally** have a **larger
impact**.]{.underline}

This is why the actions of Russia, whose northern regions account for
two-thirds of Arctic economic activity despite accounting for only half
of the region's landmass, can alter the fate of the entire circumpolar
North. The country's efforts to reduce gas flaring and emissions from
transportation in recent years have been shown to reduce radiative
forcing, or the amount of energy entering the atmosphere. At the same
time, Russia will continue to burn heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic
until 2029---the last possible moment under International Maritime
Organization (IMO) regulations. The IMO recently voted to ban HFO in the
Arctic to reduce black carbon levels, with voluntary restrictions
beginning in 2024 and mandatory ones in 2029. The five-year "grace
period" was included partly as a concession to Russia, which had opposed
the restrictions altogether. (Canada, too, does not plan to immediately
implement the HFO ban in 2024.)

Another LAP of note is algae. [As warmer spring and summer temperatures
hasten **melting** on the Arctic's snow and ice surfaces, **algae** that
lay dormant in the ice during winter venture up to the surface, where
they **bloom** in grimy green, pink, and gray. Exposure to sunlight
**darkens** the algae, which [**accelerates melting** of the ice
beneath]{.mark}.]{.underline} Climate change is also increasing wind
speeds, leading to greater transport of phosphorus, a naturally
occurring ingredient used in fertilizer. This trend is feeding the
annual algal blooms as well. One portion of the Greenland ice sheet has
become so covered in algae that scientists refer to it as "the dark
zone," a phenomenon that has increased in size and duration over the
past two decades.

As temperatures rise globally, [[the most dramatic change to the Arctic
is its **shrinking ice cap**]{.mark}.]{.underline} When Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech on October 1, 1987, in the Arctic city
of Murmansk, urging that the Arctic should be designated a "zone of
peace," the minimum extent of sea ice was a relatively robust 6.25
million square kilometers. It was hoped that the eight Arctic states
could cooperate to tackle environmental pollutants, which were the chief
fear at the time, as opposed to climate change. Yet by 2023, the frozen
surface totaled only 4.23 million square kilometers---just two-thirds of
its extent when Gorbachev called on the Arctic's nation-states to come
together.

[With the amount of **open water** increasing each year, the world can
no longer overlook the Arctic Ocean's darkening.]{.underline} The pace
of climate change is occurring at a rate that is rendering it difficult
for the region's many ice-reliant cultures and ecosystems to adapt. [By
the end of this century, it is estimated that [the Arctic's open-water
periods will have lengthened by **two months**]{.mark}---including in
the **central Arctic Ocean**, which was still covered in permanent ice
at the end of the twentieth century.]{.underline}

In roughly the same time span since Gorbachev's speech, [[the Arctic has
warmed]{.mark} nearly [**four times faster** than the rest of the world.
Such abrupt change]{.mark} has led scientists to [warn of **"tipping
points,"** or **thresholds** at which Earth systems can be radically
pushed into a qualitatively different state]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
instance, approximately 4°C of global warming could cause not only the
irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet, but also the dieback of
the boreal forest and its replacement by grasslands and open woodlands.

Whereas the Arctic Ocean is set to become darker due to climate change,
the forests of pine, spruce, and larch that comprise the sprawling
taiga---the world's largest land biome---may turn to turf that casts no
shadow. All the while, the boreal forest from Siberia to Canada is
burning each summer with heightened intensity, [[blackening the skies
and **thawing** the **permafrost**]{.mark} below, [push]{.mark}ing
**[climate goals]{.mark}** further **[out of
reach]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Even a small rise in Arctic activity creates a massive surge in local emissions; specifically, black carbon. That's Pearson. Black carbon is the worst possible addition to the region because it absorbs sunlight and releases heat\-\--that causes melting and thawing of permafrost. As it melts, it creates more dark surfaces, triggering a snowballing feedback loop of regional warming. Causes the Arctic to warm 4 times faster than everywhere else\-\--this abrupt change triggers tipping points, pushing Earth beyond its thresholds. Can't reach climate goals, that means extinction.

The [[**loss of Arctic ice** has implications for **ocean
circulation**]{.mark}, particularly **key systems**, [like
**thermohaline circulation** and the]{.mark} **Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation ([AMOC]{.mark})**]{.underline} \[80\]. As sea
ice melts, [[the **influx of freshwater** affects the **salinity and
density** of surface waters]{.mark} in the Arctic and North
Atlantic]{.underline} \[174,175\]. This influx of freshwater has the
potential [[to disturb the **equilibrium**]{.mark} required for
thermohaline circulation, [which drives **ocean
currents**]{.mark}]{.underline} by varying temperature and salt levels
\[176\]. The decrease in salinity, combined with the warming of surface
waters, can affect [[these currents]{.mark}, which [are **critical** for
transferring]{.mark} heat and **[nutrients around the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The AMOC, a critical component of the
global climate system, is **particularly susceptible** to changes in the
**Arctic**]{.underline} \[177\]. This circulation system is critical in
transporting warm water from the tropics to higher latitudes,
influencing weather patterns and climate throughout Europe and North
America \[110\]. Studies have reported that the continued [melting of
ice sheets and sea ice is contributing to a slowing in the
[AMOC]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is projected to diminish by up to 34%
by 2100 if current trends continue \[178\]. Such a [[deceleration could

The [rise in Arctic temperatures has intensified the melting and retreat
of sea ice, the reduction in snow cover, and the thawing of permafrost
in the Arctic region]{.underline} \[ 3-- 6\]. The areas of sea that have
been covered by thick ice year-round are gradually transforming into
ice-free or thin-ice regions. The rate of decline in Arctic sea ice
extent in September has a range from 0.015 × 106 km2/year to 0.049 × 106
km2/year during 1979--1998 but has accelerated to the range from 0.116 ×
106 km2/year to 0.192 × 106 km2/year during 1999--2010 \[7, 8\]. During
2013--2019, the mean annual extent of Arctic sea ice decreased from 9.23
× 106 km2 to 8.51 × 106 km2, with an annual decline rate of 1.34% \[9\].
In addition, [[Arctic sea ice **thickness** is]{.mark} also
[experiencing **rapid changes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to
satellite data, between 2003 and 2018, the volume of Arctic sea ice
decreased by 5130 km3 per decade during the autumn and by 2870 km3 per
decade during the winter. Furthermore, the mean sea ice thickness in
some areas of the Arctic decreased by 2 m over a period of 60 years
(1958--2018) \[ 10 \]. [The reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage
in the Arctic region has led to a continuous [increase in open water
areas and an **extension** of the summer **melting season**]{.mark}.
Therefore, the Arctic shipping routes have a longer navigational period,
greatly enhancing their navigational potential]{.underline} \[ 11 ,12
\]. The development of Arctic shipping routes has close connections with
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Climate Action, Life
Below Water, and Affordable and Clean Energy \[13\]. [The Arctic
Passage, which connects the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, serves
as a maritime shortcut]{.underline} \[14 \]. [It is typically separated
into the **Northern Sea Route** (NSR), the Northwest Passage (NWP), and
the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) that crosses the North Pole. The Northern
Sea Route is along the offshore waters of northern Russia, connecting
Asia and Europe.]{.underline} [It is the least ice-covered and most
navigable of the three Arctic rout]{.underline}es and is divided into
four routes by latitude: low-latitude, mid-latitude, high-latitude, and
near-polar routes \[15 -- 17\]. Compared to the traditional Suez Canal
route, the Northern Sea Route can shorten the journey by 15% to 50% \[
18 -- 22\]. The Transpolar Sea Route, which crosses the North Pole, is
the shortest sea route connecting the North Pacific and North Atlantic
\[ 19 \], but it is often heavily ice-covered, making navigation
difficult, and currently has low feasibility for navigation. The
Northwest Passage is along the Arctic coast of Alaska, the Canadian
Arctic Archipelago, and the Davis Strait, connecting Asia and eastern
North America. In 2020, the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
Working Group released the Arctic shipping status report, which
suggested that Arctic shipping had increased by 25% from 2013 to 2019
\[23 ,24 \]. Against the background of global climate change, the future
planning and navigational potential of the Arctic shipping routes will
be of great concern. Compared with the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest
Passage has heavier sea ice conditions and less developed navigation
infrastructure, making it more difficult to navigate \[ 18 , 19\]. In
addition, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has complex coastlines, narrow
waterways, and limited spatiotemporal observed sea ice data in the
region. Furthermore, the Transpolar Sea Route is adjacent to the
near-polar route of the Northern Sea Route. Therefore, this study
focuses on the Northern Sea Route, which currently has the highest
navigability, and the Transpolar Sea Route, which has the greatest
potential for future navigation, to conduct research on future route
changes and navigation potential estimation. Currently, most studies of
Arctic sea ice and Arctic shipping prediction rely on models \[18 , 25--
38\]. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) has
gathered the latest prediction data of climate models. It is better
suited to the current global warming background than the CMIP5 model
data due to the incorporation of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) \[
37 \]. The Arctic sea ice prediction data provided by CMIP6 under
various scenarios can reduce the uncertainty of future prediction data
and better represent the changing trend of Arctic sea ice in the future.
Sea ice concentration and thickness are two important parameters for
planning Arctic shipping routes and assessing navigational potential,
and their accuracy significantly affects the reliability of future
estimates for Arctic shipping. However, there has been limited research
on the accuracy of CMIP6 sea ice data. Watts et al. conducted an
evaluation of the historical data of sea ice concentration and thickness
between 1979 and 2014 from 13 CMIP6 climate models, utilizing ICESat and
CryoSat-2 satellite data \[ 35\]. Similarly, Shen et al. compared the
sea ice concentration historical data of CMIP6 and CMIP5 with
observational data and evaluated the performance of 36 CMIP6 models
during 1979--2014 \[ 38\]. Both studies presented a clear demonstration
of the differences between CMIP6 models and observational data, enabling
a comprehensive assessment of their performance. In addition, the
current studies related to Arctic shipping routes based on CMIP6 sea ice
data are primarily conducted using the multi-model mean (MMM). Li et al.
con- ducted an assessment of the navigability of Arctic shipping routes
from 2015 to 2065 using 16 models \[29 \]. Their findings revealed that
three feasible shipping scenarios demonstrated a significant reduction
in navigation risk starting from 2045, but this result was only
applicable to the SSP5-8.5 scenario (very high greenhouse gas emissions:
CO2 emissions triple by 2075). Chen et al. predicted a significant
increase and extension of navigable areas and navigable windows during
2045--2055, but further navigability assessments were lacking \[27 \].
Wei et al. conducted an analysis of the navigation probability and route
changes of the Arctic Passage by the end of the 21st century using the
Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM) \[ 36 \]. Their study
utilized the MMM to predict the future conditions of the Arctic under
the SSP2-4.5 (intermediate GHG emissions: CO2 emissions around current
levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100) and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The study predicted that the Arctic will be ice-free
in September by 2076 and 2055 under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,
respectively, enabling navigation through the Transpolar Sea Route. Min
et al. conducted an analysis of the changes in the navigation potential
of Arctic shipping between 2021 and 2100 using the ATAM \[ 31\]. The
results of the study, based on the MMM, indicated that the navigable
area for Open Water (OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6) is expected to continue
to increase in September before 2050 under both the SSP2-4.5 and
SSP5-8.5 scenarios. However, similar to the study of Wei et al. \[ 36
\], both studies did not conduct further detailed analysis of route
planning. Moreover, the results of the MMM do not clearly depict the
route planning and navigation potential evaluation results of different
models, and they are also inadequate for comparing the similarities and
differences between the results of different models. Furthermore, the
sea ice thickness division of ATAM, which has been commonly employed in
previous studies, is relatively coarse. In this study, the seven models
with better performances were selected based on the sea ice
concentration and thickness data evaluation results of various models in
CMIP6 from Watts et al. \[35 \] and Shen et al. \[ 38\], and the
CMCC-ESM2 model with relatively large differences of sea ice
concentration and thickness was also added as a comparison. Based on the
Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS) with
more detailed sea ice thickness classification (IMO, 2016), the
navigational risk of each model was quantified under two scenarios
(SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), represented by two types of vessels, Open Water
(OW) and Polar Class 6 (PC6), and the navigability of each model was
evaluated and analyzed from multiple perspectives to find out the
similarities and differences between the models and to comprehensively
predict the changes in Arctic shipping routes and navigability potential
in the next 30 years. 2. Data and Methods 2.1. CMIP6 Sea Ice Data Based
on the evaluation results of sea ice concentration and thickness from
Watts et al. \[ 35\] and Shen et al. \[ 38 \], this study utilizes
monthly sea ice concentration and thickness data with the better
performances obtained from seven climate models, including ACCESS-
ESM1-5, CESM2-WACCM, EC-Earth3-CC, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, NorESM2-MM,
and UKESM1-0-LL. The CMCC-ESM2 model with smaller simulation results of
sea ice concentration and thickness was additionally utilized as a
comparison (Table 1). CMIP6 data show that [[there will be completely
ice-free months in the Arctic **before 2050**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[ 39
\], [[and **30 years before**]{.mark} 2050 [is the period with the
**largest change in**]{.mark} **navigation
[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[ 29, 33 \]. Therefore, this study
focuses on the period between 2021 and 2050, [with a particular emphasis
on the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} and the Transpolar Sea Route
(Figure 1). The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are selected for this
research. Due to the difference in grid resolution in the CMIP6 models,
we employed the inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation technique
to convert the model data grids into a consistent grid size with a
resolution of 12.5 km × 12.5 km.

[The [**melting** of glaciers and ice sheets]{.mark} in the Arctic,
particularly the Greenland ice sheet]{.underline}, has increased in
recent past, [[creating]{.mark} concerns about **[global sea level
rise]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[163\]. The Greenland ice sheet is losing
mass at an alarming rate, with yearly ice loss growing from around 50
billion tonnes in the 1990s to nearly 280 billion tonnes by 2018
\[164\]. The glacial melting trend in the Arctic is driven by the
combination of surface melting caused by rising temperatures and greater
iceberg calving from glaciers into the ocean \[165,166\]. Satellite data
reveal that surface melting accounts for around 60% of ice loss, which
is exacerbated by rising air temperatures and changes in atmospheric
circulation \[167,168\]. Short-term climate variability and extreme

In 2024, the world witnessed an unprecedented rise in sea levels,
coinciding with what has been recorded as Earth's hottest year. This
alarming trend was highlighted by [[NASA's]{.mark} detailed
[analysis]{.mark}, revealing the unexpected extent of **oceanic
changes**. The report [underscores the urgent reality of]{.mark} climate
change and its tangible effects on our planet's oceans]{.underline}. As
the globe continues to grapple with increasing temperatures,
[understanding the dynamics of **[sea level rise]{.mark}** becomes
crucial]{.underline}. This article delves into the significant findings
of NASA's study, exploring the mechanisms behind these changes and their
potential implications for future generations.

NASA's Groundbreaking Findings on Sea Level Rise

According to the latest analysis released by NASA, [global sea
levels]{.underline} rose by a staggering 0.23 inches (0.59 centimeters)
in 2024. This is notably higher than the previously predicted 0.17
inches (0.43 cm). Such a [rise has been [attributed to]{.mark} an
unusual amount of ocean warming and [the **influx of meltwater from
glaciers** and other **land-based ice**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The study,
led by NASA's expert team using sophisticated satellite imagery,
highlights the accelerated pace at which our oceans are swelling. Josh
Willis from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory emphasized the increasing
[rate of sea level rise, noting that each year presents new **challenges
and surprises**]{.underline}.

This unexpected rise serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of
human-induced climate change. [As greenhouse gas emissions continue to
heat our planet, the resulting thermal expansion of seawater and the
melting of polar ice caps contribute significantly to **rising sea
levels**]{.underline}. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite,
launched in 2020, plays a pivotal role in monitoring these changes,
providing critical data to inform global responses to this growing
threat.

The Role of Thermal Expansion and Ice Melt

[Sea level rise is **primarily driven** by two key processes: the
**melting of glaciers and ice caps**, and the thermal expansion of
seawater as it warms]{.underline}. Traditionally, the melting of
land-based ice has been the dominant factor; however, NASA's 2024
findings reveal a shift. In that year, thermal expansion accounted for
two-thirds of the observed sea level rise, marking a significant change
in the underlying dynamics.

This shift underscores the complex interplay between various climate
factors. As Earth's temperatures reach unprecedented highs, thermal
expansion's role becomes increasingly prominent. This process, where
water expands as it heats up, is a direct consequence of rising global
temperatures. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting
future trends and implementing effective mitigation strategies. As these
changes accelerate, the need for comprehensive climate policies becomes
ever more pressing.

Historical Context and Future Projections

To grasp the full impact of recent sea level changes, it's essential to
consider the historical context. Over a three-decade period from 1993 to
2023, global sea levels rose by approximately four inches (10 cm) in
total. This steady increase is visually represented in a graph provided
by NASA, showing a solid red line that indicates the trajectory of this
rise. The dotted red line projects future increases, highlighting the
ongoing challenges posed by climate change.

The year 2024 stands out not only for its record-breaking temperatures
but also for the accelerated pace of sea level rise. As the planet
continues to warm, projections suggest further [[increases in sea
levels]{.mark}, [threaten]{.mark}ing coastal communities and
**[ecosystems worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This growing threat
necessitates urgent action to address the root causes of climate change
and mitigate its impacts on vulnerable populations.

Implications for Coastal Communities and Global Populations

[The implications of rising sea levels are profound]{.underline},
particularly for communities living on islands or along coastlines. [As
oceans encroach upon inhabited areas, the risks of [**flooding, erosion,
and habitat loss** intensify]{.mark}. This [poses]{.mark} significant
[challenges for **infrastructure, food security**, and]{.mark} the
**livelihoods** of millions of people worldwide]{.underline}. Humanity's
continued emission of greenhouse gases exacerbates these risks,
underscoring the need for immediate and sustained action.

Efforts to combat climate change must prioritize adaptive strategies to
protect vulnerable populations. This includes investing in resilient
infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, and promoting
sustainable land-use practices. [As we confront the realities of a
changing climate, international cooperation and innovative solutions
become crucial in **safeguarding [the future of our
planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The **[Arctic permafrost]{.mark}** zone [covers]{.mark} approximately
**[24% of the Northern Hemisphere]{.mark}**'s geographical area,
including **Alaska, Canada, Siberia, and northern
Scandinavia**]{.underline} \[182\]. Permafrost is defined as permanently
frozen ground that can range in depth from a few meters to over 1500 m
in some areas \[183\]. Permafrost depth is determined by a variety of
factors, including local climate, vegetation cover, and soil composition
\[184\]. Continuous permafrost locations have a thicker and more stable
layer, whereas sporadic permafrost locations have greater depth
variability and sensitivity to warming \[185\]. Recent data show that
[[permafrost]{.mark} is [thawing]{.mark} at an **accelerated rate** as
global temperatures rise]{.underline}, with some research suggesting
that the Arctic permafrost area is warming by about 0.5 °C each decade
\[186\]. This enhanced thawing causes ground sinking, which [poses
issues for **infrastructure** and **alters hydrological
processes**]{.underline} \[187\]. [Thawing permafrost can also produce
**significant changes** in Arctic geomorphology, as melting ice [creates
**thermokarsts**, which]{.mark} are depressions or uneven terrain caused
by the melting of ice-rich permafrost]{.underline} \[188\]. [These
**landscape alterations** have the potential to destabilise ecosystems
and habitat stability, **[exacerbat]{.mark}ing the [regional impacts of

**carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)**]{.underline}. According to
Strauss et al. \[189\], permafrost holds roughly 1500 gigatons of
organic carbon, which is comparable to twice the current atmospheric
carbon stock. As permafrost thaws, the microbial breakdown of organic
materials increases, releasing CO2 \[190\]. [Anaerobic conditions in

The [[significant **drop** in the **Arctic Sea ice volume**]{.mark}, a
vital indicator for assessing the **severity** of Arctic
**warming**]{.underline}, is a major focus of recent climate research
\[17,155\]. Unlike sea ice extent or thickness, sea ice volume is a more
[sensitive indication of climate change because it [incorporates]{.mark}
both the **[horizontal]{.mark}** dispersion [and **vertical**
thickness]{.mark} of the ice]{.underline} \[156,157\]. Over the past 40
years, the volume of sea ice has declined by about 75% \[158\]. Summer
minimums have decreased from over 16,000 km3 to under 4000 km3,
indicating a breakdown of the multi-year ice cover \[148\]. This [[loss
of **multi-year ice**]{.mark} (MYI), which is more **resistant** to
melting than **first-year ice** (FYI), [is a **major contributor to the
positive feedback loop of the Arctic**]{.mark}, in which melting ice
exposes darker ocean water, [**increasing warming** and **additional ice
loss**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[156\]. As MYI disappears, the Arctic is
increasingly dominated by FYI, which is less stable and more vulnerable
to seasonal fluctuations. The transition from MYI to FYI has profound
implications, affecting not only the climate system but also the
region's ecological and biogeochemical stability \[148,159\]. Given this
tendency, there is growing fear that [the Arctic [may experience an
**ice-free summer** within the next **15 years**]{.mark}, with
far-reaching implications for both regional and **global
climates**]{.underline} \[160\]. Paleoenvironmental records provide
important information about the long-term variability of Arctic Sea ice
and how it interacts with climate and ecosystems. Evidence from the East
Greenland shelf reveals prior sea ice events, revealing transitions
towards colder, lower-salinity conditions approximately 4.7 ka,
indicating the start of neoglacial cooling \[161\]. These data indicate
that sea ice variability has historically been a key driver of Arctic
climate and ecosystem changes. However, [the current rate of sea ice
loss is **unprecedented**, and the future course of Arctic ice loss is
unpredictable. The increase in polar water input and Arctic Sea ice
export [could worsen **cooling trends**]{.mark} in the north Atlantic
Ocean, thereby [affecting **global ocean circulation and weather
patterns**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[162\]. Understanding these
paleosignals in the context of present climate change is important for
improving forecasts of future Arctic conditions and their implications.

If surviving to see the sun fry Earth is a long shot, when is humanity
likely to meet its doom? Paleontologically, mammalian species usually
persist for about a million years, says Henry Gee, a paleontologist and
senior editor at the journal Nature, whose forthcoming book is on the
extinction of humans. That would put the human species in its youth. But
Gee doesn\'t think these rules necessarily apply for H. sapiens.

\"[Humans are rather an exceptional species]{.underline},\" he says.
\"[We could last for millions of years, or we could all drop down next
week]{.underline}.\"

Opportunities for doomsday abound. [[Humans could]{.mark} be wiped out
by a catastrophic asteroid strike, commit **self-destruction** with
worldwide nuclear war or [succumb to the **ravages caused by the
climate**]{.mark} **emergency**. But humans are a hardy bunch, so [the
**most likely scenario** involves a **combination** of
catastrophes]{.mark} that could eradicate us completely]{.underline}.

Pick Your Poison

Some species killers are out of our control. In a 2021 paper in the
journal Icarus, for example, researchers describe how asteroids
comparable to the one spanning 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter that
killed off the nonavian dinosaurs hit Earth approximately every 250
million to 500 million years. In a preprint paper posted on the server
arXiv.org, physicists Philip Lubin and Alexander N. Cohen calculate that
humanity would have the ability to save itself from a dino-killer-size
asteroid, given six months\' warning and an arsenal of nuclear
penetrators to blow the space rock into a cloud of harmless pebbles.
With less warning or a larger asteroid, Lubin and Cohen suggest,
humanity should give up and \"party\" or \"move to Mars or the Moon to
party.\" Currently the biggest asteroid that scientists know of with the
potential to strike Earth is called (29075) 1950 DA. It is a mere 1,300
meters across and has a one-in-50,000 chance of hitting our world in
March 2880, according to a 2022 risk analysis by the European Space
Agency.

Incoming space rocks aside, [many threats to humanity are of our own
making: **nuclear war**, the **climate** emergency, **ecological
collapse**]{.underline}. We might be done in by our own tech in the form
of sentient artificial intelligence that decides to snuff out its
creators, as some AI critics have suggested.

An all-out nuclear war could easily destroy humanity, says François
Diaz-Maurin, associate editor for nuclear affairs at the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists. The last time humans dropped nuclear bombs on one
another, only one country, the U.S., had nuclear warheads, so there was
no risk of nuclear retaliation. That\'s not the case today---and now the
bombs are a lot bigger. Those older bombs, which struck the Japanese
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, packed the equivalent of 15
and 21 kilotons of TNT, respectively. Together they killed an estimated
110,000 to 210,000 people. A single modern-day, 300-kiloton nuclear
weapon dropped on New York City, for example, would kill a million
people in 24 hours, Diaz-Maurin says. A regional nuclear war, such as
one between India and Pakistan, could kill 27 million people in the
short term, whereas a full-scale nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia
could cause an estimated 360 million direct deaths, he adds.

The threat to humanity\'s very existence would come after the war, when
soot from massive fires ignited by the bombings would rapidly alter the
climate in a scenario known as nuclear winter. Fears of nuclear winter
may have receded since the end of the cold war, Diaz-Maurin says, but
research shows that the environmental consequences would be severe. Even
a regional nuclear war would damage the ozone layer, block out sunlight
and reduce precipitation worldwide. The result would be a global famine
that might kill more than five billion people in just two years,
depending on the size and number of detonations.

\"That possibility of destroying humanity is still here and real,\"
Diaz-Maurin says.

[Death by ecological contamination or the climate emergency would be
slower but still within the realm of possibility. Already humans are
facing health stressors from chronic pollution that have been
exacerbated by the additional heat brought on by climate
change]{.underline}, says Maureen Lichtveld, dean of the School of
Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. [Hotter temperatures
force people to breathe more rapidly to dispel warmth, which draws more
pollution into their lungs. [The **climate emergency**]{.mark} also
**[deepens]{.mark}** existing [problems around **food
security**]{.mark}---for instance, persistent [**drought** can
**devastate cropland**]{.mark}---[and **infectious disease**]{.mark}.
\"[The **interconnectedness** of **climate change**]{.mark} and health
inequities and inequities in general [is what]{.mark} is
**[impact]{.mark}ing our [global population]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline}
Lichtveld says.

The Perfect Storm

Will these inequities eventually lead to a species-wide downfall? It\'s
not easy to calculate the likelihood that, say, the climate emergency
will kill us all, says Luke Kemp, a research affiliate at the Center for
the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. But it\'s
probably not realistic to consider risks individually anyway, he says.

\"[When we look at the history of things like mass extinctions and
societal collapses, it\'s never **just one thing** that
happens]{.underline},\" Kemp says. \"If you\'re trying to rely on a
single silver bullet to kill everyone in a single event, you have to
write sci-fi.\"

[[The end of humanity is]{.mark} far [**more likely** to be brought
about by **multiple factors**]{.mark}, Kemp says---[a **pileup of
disasters**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although apocalyptic movies often turn
to viruses, bacteria and fungi to wipe out huge swathes of the
population, [a pandemic alone probably won\'t drive humanity to
extinction]{.underline} simply because the immune system is a broad and
effective defense, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician
and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. A
pandemic could be devastating and lead to severe upheaval---the Black
Death killed 30 to 50 percent of Europe\'s population---but it\'s
unlikely that a pathogen would kill all of humanity, Adalja says. \"Yes,
an infectious disease could kill a lot of people,\" he says, \"but then
you\'re going to have a group \[of people\] that are resilient to it and
survive.\"

Humans also have tools to fight back against a pathogen, from medical
treatments to vaccines to the social-distancing measures that became
familiar worldwide during the COVID pandemic, Adalja says. There is one
example of a mammalian species that may have been entirely eliminated by
an infectious disease, he says: the Christmas Island rat (Rattus
macleari), also called Maclear\'s rat, an endemic island species that
may have gone extinct because of the introduction of a parasite.

\"We are not helpless like the Christmas Island rat, which couldn\'t get
away from that island,\" Adalja says. \"We have the ability to change
our fate.\"

If infectious disease contributes to the downfall of humanity, [it will
probably be as just **one piece of a larger puzzle**. Imagine [a planet
pushed to upheaval by **sea-level rise** and disruption to
**agriculture** from climate change]{.mark}. The [humans]{.mark} of this
climate-ravaged [world attempt]{.mark} a **[geoengineering]{.mark}
solution** [that **goes wrong**]{.mark}. The situation worsens.
[Resources are **scarce**]{.mark}, and a bunch of [countries have
**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}. Oh, by the way, the [mosquitoes]{.mark}
that [carry **yellow fever**]{.mark} range [as far]{.mark} north [as
Canada in this scenario]{.mark}. It\'s not hard to see how [the human
population could]{.mark} decline and [**disappear** in the face of an
**arsenal of challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Kemp.

Worst-case scenarios are understudied, Kemp says. In climate science,
for example, there is a lot of research into what the world might look
like at two or three degrees Celsius warmer than the preindustrial
average but very little looking at what an increase of five or six
degrees C might look like. This is partly because scientists have a hard
time predicting the effects of that much warming and partly because
climate scientists feel pressure from politicians not to appear
alarmist, Kemp says. Models of future worst-case scenarios also tend to
do an inadequate job of predicting the cascading effects of a disaster.
\"The general field of existential risk is relatively new, nascent and
just understudied,\" Kemp says.

There are questions as to how much humans should worry about something
as big picture as extinction. While some see the question as
pressing---controversial tech billionaires such as Elon Musk and Peter
Thiel have funded organizations dedicated to studying the risks of
transformative technologies---others argue that today\'s problems are
urgent enough. [Already humans are heating the globe, overexploiting and
destroying nature, using land and water unsustainably]{.underline}, and
creating chemicals that are harmful to all life, often in service to the
globally well-off, says Sarah Cornell, who studies global sustainability
at the Stockholm Resilience Center at Stockholm University.

\"Today\'s reality is that some human beings are undermining or even
destroying living conditions of many, many other people,\" Cornell says.
\"[[From]{.mark} a **[human-scale]{.mark}** perspective, [this is an
**existential crisis**]{.mark} already, not a risk somewhere up
ahead]{.underline}.\"

The **[[Arctic sea ice]{.mark} (ASI)]{.underline}** is
[[chang]{.mark}ing **[rapidly]{.mark}**, with]{.underline} [[significant
implications for]{.mark} both the **[regional and global
ecology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The significant drop in ASI extent,
area, and volume observed over the last few decades is evidence of
human-induced climate change, underlining the Arctic's vulnerability to
rising temperatures \[148\]. This trend is more than just a climatic
anomaly; it is also closely related to biological and biogeochemical
processes that are currently poorly understood, notably how ASI
interacts with life-history events in Arctic biota. While the
[[impacts]{.mark} of **ASI loss**, [such as **altered migration and
breeding**]{.mark}]{.underline} patterns in marine and terrestrial
species, have been extensively documented \[149\], the more complex
indirect impacts remain a key area of investigation. These [indirect
consequences involve a series of interactions between many **ecosystem
components**, such as altered predator--prey relationships and
**[disrupt]{.mark}ions to [food webs]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[150\].

The effects of ASI on biogeochemical cycles, notably mercury cycling,
are a major concern \[151\]. [**[Rapid loss]{.mark}** of sea ice is

What's the connection between black carbon, the Arctic and the shipping
industry?

The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, and
rapidly approaching the point where such as the loss of sea ice and
melting of the Greenland ice sheet, are affecting ocean circulation
patterns in the North Atlantic.

[**[Black carbon]{.mark}** is solid particulate matter -- which we call
soot -- produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels in the engine
combustion chambers and then ejected into the atmosphere. This soot
[absorbs sunlight and by warming the surrounding atmosphere becomes a
**powerful**]{.mark} short-lived climate pollutant, aka **[super
pollutant]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although black carbon is not a
greenhouse gas, these emissions form "shipping's second largest cause of
global warming" after carbon dioxide, and makes up around one-fifth of
international shipping's already considerable climate impact.

[Overall, [black carbon contributes more than **three thousand times**
the **climate warming impact** of the same mass of **CO2**]{.mark} in
the atmosphere [over a 20 year period. In its recent]{.mark} 6th
[Assessment Report, the UN]{.mark} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

Although anoxic environments typically emit 3.4 times less total carbon
than oxic environments, and CO2 emissions continue to dominate,
[[enhanced **CH4 emissions** have **\~35 times more warming potential
than CO2**]{.mark} on a 100-year timescale]{.underline}. Therefore, an
increase of CH4 production will have marked impact on the PCF74,75. CH4
is produced by methanogenic microorganisms in anoxic subsurface
environments. [Most of the CH4 is metabolized by methanotrophs, and
[even a **few centimetres** of]{.mark} oxic environmental
[buffering]{.mark} can [facilitate]{.mark} the microbial **[oxidation of
all CH4]{.mark}** that passes through diffusively]{.underline}76,77. In
wetland environments, for example, methanotrophs typically oxidize
20--60% of the CH4 produced in **[subsurface
permafrost78]{.underline}**. Therefore, the most efficient routes of CH4
dispersion into the atmosphere are ebullition and aerenchymous
transference in thermokarst wetlands and lakes, \~4% of the global
methane budget24,27,79.

[[In **thawed permafrost**]{.mark}, microbial [carbon transformation is
impacted]{.mark} by soil moisture, temperature, light and nutrient
availability]{.underline}54,78,80--82. [[With]{.mark} increased
inundation related to changing precipitation or [**abrupt thaw**, CH4
release will **increase proportionally**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
anoxic environment expansion as microbial carbon transformation
increases83. [In a recent example, [in the tundra]{.mark} north of 60°

\~5.5TgCH4 per year) **[[between 2000 and 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
indicating the potential for an increasing trend in methane release84.
However, in thawed permafrost, zones with higher redox potential create
ideal regions for methanotrophs to convert CH4 to CO2 at a similar
rapidity, making moisture and aeration essential determinants of
greenhouse gas composition16,27,62.

The advent of [climate change has brought]{.underline} about a number of
different changes in the Arctic, including [increased **accessibility**
to Arctic **ports** as well as the opening of new Arctic **shipping
lanes**. With new trans-Arctic routes, including the **Northern Sea
Route (NSR)**]{.underline} and the Northwest Passage (NWP), [as well as
newly built and refurbished ports from Russia, political and military
interests are reevaluating the region as one of **geopolitical
competition**. While [the Arctic traditionally]{.mark} was
[characterized by **coop**]{.mark}eration [and **low tensions**]{.mark},
that [is **changing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A report from the US
Congressional Research Service (CRS) on the Arctic notes that although
there is still important cooperation in the region, [the Arctic is
increasingly seen as [an area for geopolitical competition amongst the
**US**, **China**, and **Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline}1) The article
will discuss the geopolitical ramifications of the NSR and NWP as well
as the building and refurbishing of ports in the Arctic. [With [the
emergence of new possible **shipping lanes**]{.mark} such as the **NSR**
and the NWP, states are **changing their behavior** [in the Arctic. As
the ice diminishes, these shorter]{.mark} maritime [routes]{.mark},
their respective ports and natural resources [are causing a **renewal of
interest**]{.mark} in what was once considered an impassable
region.]{.underline} States have expressed interest in using new
shipping lanes for shorter transit times, strategic resource extraction,
military activity as well as regional shipping, fishing and tourism.2)
However, with its unpredictable seas, severe climate conditions, high
costs, and lack of developed infrastructure in the northern territories
-- the Arctic has many obstacles for socio-economic and maritime
development.3) Despite these obstacles, this [renewed regional interest
may lead to **increased geopolitical tensions**.]{.underline} Increasing
traffic brings the possibility of unknown ships close to many of these
country's coasts in a way that they are not familiar with. States then
must determine how to control their northern borders in harsh climates
and territories that, until recently, were impassable. Without some kind
of vigilance over their borders, Arctic states may also run the risk of
facilitating or falling victim to increased transnational crime. For
example, unknown ships also bring with them unknown purposes, of which
many could be illegal fishing or even illicit trafficking. Further, the
development of the NSR and NWP also presents possible issues. Unresolved
disputes about the sovereignty of these new sea routes may be
problematic when shipping does eventually become an option. [[China and
Russia's **coop**]{.mark}eration [on the development of the
**NSR**]{.mark} also [brings with it concerns about **Chinese influence
in the Arctic**]{.mark} as well as American hand-wringing about [a
closer relationship between **Russia and China**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Northern Sea Route Although the Northern Sea Route
([NSR]{.underline}) was first opened by the Soviet Union in the 1930s,
it [has not been a reliable transit route for many decades due to ice
coverage.]{.underline}4) However, [[with the increasing melting of the
polar ice caps]{.mark}, the NSR is looking more and more like a
potential transit route.]{.underline} However, [[there are
**geopolitical implications** concerning the NSR]{.underline}]{.mark}
that raise interesting questions. Perhaps the most basic geopolitical
consideration is who has power over the NSR. Russia has claimed that the
NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it exclusive rights to
develop the area and to patrol ships.5) The United States and other
powers have disputed this claim, which has led to an interesting paradox
where neither side recognizes the veracity of who can control this
passageway. Interestingly, Canada does recognize Russia's claim over the
NSR as Russia recognizes Canada's claim over the NWP (See below).
[Another geopolitical concern is the development of the
NSR]{.underline}. While the United States has failed for many years to
express interest, not all states have taken such an approach. [China,
for example, is working with Russia to **develop the NSR** as China sees
the route as important for its **national economic
interests**.]{.underline} Although the investment is hugely expensive
and time consuming, [China clearly sees the development of the NSR as
playing the long game.]{.underline}6) [While the route may not be usable
now, in a few decades, that could easily change. Geopolitically, this
has huge implications as it brings **China and Russia closer together as
allies**]{.underline} and encourages both states to develop more
icebreakers -- a necessary tool to navigate the region. The Northwest
Passage While much of the headlines tend to highlight the importance of
the NSR, the Northwest passage (NWP) also raises its own concerns,
mirroring those of Russia. Canada claims that the NWP is located in
internal Canadian waters and therefore any ship is subject to Canadian
law and sovereignty.7) With the opening of the NWP, Canadian analysts
have also raised concerns about potential environmental disasters,
military security, and the security of people. However, the question
also comes down to sovereignty as with the NSR.8) The United States and
the European Union have quibbled with Canada's claim of sovereignty,
claiming that the NWP is an international strait and that there is a non
suspendable right of transit. As noted above, Russia and Canada
recognize each other's claim over their respective Arctic passages.
Geopolitically, the opening of the NWP has similar implications as the
NSR. While there is less development with other nations, international
legal questions still remain unanswered about who has control over the
strait. Given the slow rate of change, there is still time to find a
compromise to this important geopolitical question before the route is
completely free of ice. The second geopolitical concern is of potential
disasters and military security in the region. Analysts have pointed to
the possibility of terrorists entering Canada from the lightly populated
Arctic region -- making the opening of this route concerning for
Canadian national security. While that seems unlikely due to the high
costs of entering Canada in this way, it presents states with new
security problems to deal with. New Ports [One of the more interesting
developments in the Arctic has been the [development of new ports, both
hydrocarbon and **military-oriented**]{.mark}, throughout the region.
Russia is the main mover behind this trend, with **Russian
militarization** of the Arctic a growing concern for many policymakers,
particularly in the United States.]{.underline} This buildup can be
explained in a few different ways: defense and survivability of
second-strike assets, protection of Russia's commercial interests, and
addressing economic challenges in its polar region.9) While there may be
different reasons for this buildup, there is no question that it is
happening. In recent years, Russia has reopened more than 50 Soviet
bases in the Arctic, both providing themselves more strategic ports
throughout the region as well as sending a message to other
countries.10) [No other state has as solid a presence in the Arctic as
Russia does. Opening these ports, no matter how practical, send the
signal that Russia wants to retain what it sees as a historic domination
of the region.]{.underline} It is tempting to see [these new ports as
[the first step of a **geopolitical contest** between **great
powers**]{.mark}. The construction of these ports is akin, **according
to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo**, to Chinese actions in the South
China Sea, presenting an **aggressive pattern of
behaviour**.]{.underline}11) Whether or not that is true, Pompeo's
speech indicates that the US perceives it as such and will react as it
sees fit. While it is certainly sending a message, I would argue that it
is not done so with the intent to be purely provocative. With the
opening of the NSR and increasing hydrocarbon extraction and research,
Russia needs more bases to keep track of its growing activity. It is not
feasible to expect economic development without subsequent government
support in the form of bases. However, this narrative of geopolitical
competition is certainly present in both Russia and in Western
countries. Geopolitical Analysis The opening of new shipping lanes and
construction of new ports do not inherently indicate increased
geopolitical tensions in the Arctic. However, their consequences do.
Increased activity in the NSR and NWP comes with a few geopolitical
concerns. As discussed above, the first is that of sovereignty. There is
no clarity in either of these shipping lanes as to who actually has
power over who can pass and what standards they must adhere to in order
to do so. Without this information, there will be increased uncertainty
and therefore more possibilities for misunderstandings between states.
The second concern is the possibility of transnational crime. With
increased traffic in these waterways, Arctic states will have to find
some way of monitoring unknown ships and activity. If not, the Arctic
may see an increase in illegal fishing and trafficking. This indicates
that Arctic states, particularly Canada and Russia, must determine
better ways of controlling their northern borders. Imposing more border
control measures may imply that there will be increased military and
security presence. While an increased security presence might indicate
stability, generally it may also lead to rising tensions between powers.
A final geopolitical concern is that of the relationship between Russia
and China. [The development of the NSR has started the beginning of a
potential alliance between Russia and China where China provides funding
and technology for NSR development and Russia provides both access and
future benefits for China who may wish to utilize the NSR. From an
American perspective, [a Russia-Chinese alliance is concerning as
it]{.mark} increases the possibility of Chinese influence in the Arctic
as well as [brings together two countries who both have poor
relationships with the US]{.mark}. Whether or not American stress turns
out to be warranted, [the US will]{.mark} still [**act** according to
this fear and]{.mark} may [begin to **build up military strength in the
Arctic**]{.mark} just in case.]{.underline} While it may seem as though
change is happening very quickly in the Arctic, **[there is still
time]{.underline}** to prepare for geographic changes up North. States
will not have to decide on the fly what new policies will be without
coordinating with other Arctic counterparts. In short, geopolitical
tensions may be at risk of rising but there is no rush to make decisions
without thoroughly considering all of the ways to avoid geopolitical
conflict.

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [the spectre of [a
**third world war** looms on the **horizon**]{.mark}. Military and
political leaders in **NATO** nations have issued chilling warnings for
populations to brace for [the possibility of **devastating superpower
conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Admiral Rob Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the opening
salvo in the grim round of predictions. He cautioned that Russia could
launch an attack within the next two decades. In words reminiscent of
World War II, Bauer urged allied countries to mobilise citizen armies.

British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has gone even further, foreseeing
[potential wars [involving]{.mark} **China**, **[Russia]{.mark}**, North
Korea and Iran [within the **next five years**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
situation is transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war world", he
asserted bleakly.

General Sir Patrick Sanders, the UK's army chief, echoed that dark
prediction. He described the British population as a "pre-war
generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an increasingly
aggressive Russia.

German politicians and military leaders have discussed resurrecting
mandatory military service in response to growing threats and Sweden has
already introduced a form of national service as it closes in on NATO
membership.

To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks on
Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable.

However, amid the drumbeats of international conflict, [one crucial
factor is being overlooked: the impact of **climate change** as a
potential **trigger for war**.]{.underline}

NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate and
security. Yet the landmark climate agreement reached late last year at
the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for Western leaders
meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and translate them
into tangible action.

[NATO recognises climate change as a **'threat amplifier'** for
traditional security issues, but it needs to go further as studies
indicate **global [warming]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} already [**rapidly

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, **Vladimir

[**survival** of his **regime**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic is
estimated to hold 412 billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the
world's undiscovered reserves.

[Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [Russia]{.mark} already
[operates]{.mark} a third [more Arctic **military bases** than the

His propaganda machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in
white fatigues and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow
on sleighs pulled by reindeer.

America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in the central Arctic
Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a titanium Russian flag
on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North Pole.

[More [aggressive Russian claims in the Arctic could **force NATO to

[**prioritise climate action** to mitigate]{.mark} the risk of global
warming becoming the **catalyst** for a **[catastrophic

Following the COP28 agreement to 'transition away from fossil fuels',
NATO must modify its climate ambitions and let the consensus reached in
Dubai guide its strategy to head off the threat of global war provoked
by climate change.

The Dubai agreement has been endorsed by 198 countries, including NATO
allies. However, in the words of COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who is
also attending the Munich conference: "An agreement is only as good as
its implementation ... We must take the steps necessary to turn this
agreement into tangible action."

NATO's focus should extend beyond its current voluntary emissions
reduction targets to include COP28's agreement to triple renewable
energy capacity by 2030.

[Since **[halting Arctic warming is pivotal to preventing]{.mark}
conflict**, NATO must also explore safe geoengineering solutions to slow
or reverse Arctic melting.]{.underline}

[It is time for world leaders to act in the knowledge that failure to
urgently address the climate emergency exposes the world to the risk of

We use ALAN as indicator of [**human activity** in [the terrestrial

cautiousness. Snow albedo effects might enhance artificial light
effects, but that means it also should be included as part of the light
pollution of human activity. There can be an overestimation of lit area
from satellites compared to actual lit area on the ground mainly due to
large pixel size and geolocation errors (34) or residuals in the
corrected dataset sourced by auroras and blooming effects, yet also a
significant underestimation of the area in underdeveloped regions (35).
However, while the total lit area might overestimate the direct impact
by infrastructure, it is a reliable indicator of both hotspots of
current human activity in the Arctic and of development over time.
[Accordingly, we use the area of ALAN as an indicator of the total area

Global climate change affects the Arctic region more than any other part
of the world -- the Arctic is warming up to seven times faster than
mid-latitudes.1) While eco-activists and environmental organizations
point out that this process is a threat to the whole world, [oil and gas
companies see a great opportunity in developing their offshore projects
on the continental shelf due to several reasons. Firstly, the **melting
of glaciers** and **sea ice** provides access to the **new oil and gas
fields**]{.underline}2) [that are estimated to account for 5.3 percent
and 21.7 percent of the global proved oil and gas
reserves.]{.underline}3) [Secondly, a **longer ice-free period** reduces
the **costs of exploration and production** activities.]{.underline}4)
[Thus, the Arctic has a potential for hydrocarbon's energy development
and hence the problem of affiliated pollution is acute.]{.underline}

Scientific research is mostly concerned with the remote sources of
Arctic pollution. However, the ongoing oil and gas extraction on the
Arctic continental shelf has already had a devastating impact on the
composition of the Arctic atmosphere. [[One]{.mark} of the [**main**
source]{.mark}s [of Arctic]{.mark} air [pollution is **gas
flaring**]{.mark} -- the practice of burning associated gas, [a]{.mark}
common [byproduct of **oil extraction**]{.mark}. The joint study of
Norwegian, Finnish, and Russian scholars concluded that in the Arctic
region [gas flaring]{.mark} contributes to a much larger share of total
**black carbon emissions**: in fact, it [accounts for **42 percent** of
all Arctic **black carbon** surface concentrations]{.mark}, when the
global average is only 3 percent.]{.underline}5) It is essential to
highlight that the method of gas flaring is used at the Prirazlomnoye
field, the only Russian project on the Arctic shelf.6) In 2021 140.57
million m3 were flared on the Prirazlomnaya offshore platform.7) [[The
pollutants]{.mark} released during the gas flaring and other oil and gas
exploration activities on the Arctic shelf [facilitate the **warming**
of this region]{.mark}, which has implications for the **biodiversity**
in the area and the lives of at least 5 million people]{.underline},8)
[including the Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} Therefore, the issue of
the pollution related to oil and gas extraction on the Arctic shelf is
worth consideration.

[Approximately **[8100 km2 of Alaska]{.mark}** are [leased to the **oil
and gas** industry for **exploration and
extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to industry estimates,
subsurface expansion from these leases could cover up to 130.2 km2 per
pad. [As industrial oil extraction activities increase across the
thawing Alaskan permafrost, [impacts on the permafrost]{.mark}
environment [will include **rapid thaw**]{.mark}, increased
**hydrological flux**, [and the **release of**]{.mark} climate warming
**[greenhouse gases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here, we use remote sensing
and field observations to provide a first-order comparison of the direct
impacts to the permafrost tundra from oil well pads, and the longterm
consequences of a legacy oil pads on the warming North Slope of Alaska.
We find that oil well pads on the permafrost accelerate permafrost
degradation and persist despite remediation.

[[In 1986, **Chevron** and **B**]{.mark}ritish **[P]{.mark}**etroleum
[built the **first**]{.mark} and only oil [well in the Arctic]{.mark}
National Wildlife Refuge]{.underline}. A 700 m x 350 m pad supported [a
well [called **KIC-1**]{.mark}]{.underline} to which all infrastructure
was transported over newly built roads from Kaktovik 15 miles to the
southeast (Fig. 1)1,2 . KIC-1 drilling reached a depth of 9631 m, but it
is unknown if oil was discovered3,4 . [[**Soon after**, the project
**stopped**, the equipment]{.mark} on the site was [disassembled, and
the well]{.mark} was **[capped]{.mark}**]{.underline}4 . In the
following years, [**remediation was completed** to industry
standards]{.underline}, the only known oil pad remediated on the Alaskan
permafrost tundra5 . [[Although there was **no activity** at KIC-1 in
the **40 years** since]{.mark} remediation, **[permafrost
subsidence]{.mark}**, **pooling water**, [and]{.mark} areas of [**abrupt
thaw are still visible**, **expanding** past]{.mark} the region [where
the]{.mark} surface [pad was initially established]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As the KIC-1 site is undisturbed since remediation, it presents a unique
case study for observing oil and gas pad impacts to the permafrost over
time.

Since the development and remediation of the KIC-1 oil well, oil and gas
exploration and withdrawal in the Alaskan North Slope are ongoing6,7 .
To date, almost 8,094 km2 of Alaska are leased to the oil and gas
industry for active withdrawal, in addition to the National Petroleum
Reserve, which covers an additional 93,078 km2 of permafrost tundra
above the Arctic Circle2,8 . Located inside the Arctic circle, Prudhoe
Bay Oil Field in the North Slope is the United States' largest oil
field, covering an area of 864.2 km2 of permafrost tundra1 . It was
established in 1968, began production in 1977, and currently produces
over 19,013 barrels of crude oil per day (\~1.590×107 t/a)1 . According
to estimates from the oil industry, [[**subsurface expansion** from
active oil and gas withdrawal could cover]{.mark} between 2 and
**[130]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 [**[km2 per pad]{.mark}**, resulting in
**[substantial below-ground permafrost
disturbance]{.mark}**]{.underline}8 .

Studies of the direct impacts on the permafrost landscape from oil pads
have discovered that [infrastructure development leads to changes to the
**movement of wildlife**]{.underline}9,10, [**increased permafrost thaw
rates** and water pooling]{.underline}6,11,12, [and **pollution** from

may include increased water flow and **thermal impacts** that create a
marsh-like surface cover]{.underline}6,17--19, [and the **release of

[Localized thaw can also introduce risks to **critical infrastructure**,

have sought to understand the long-term ecosystem impacts to the
permafrost from oil drilling6,13,14,26--30, our effort to compare the
residual impacts from a remediated legacy pad to the direct impacts of
current infrastructure is a new application of cross-scale observational

Warming events in the Arctic have increased in frequency in the past few
years45,46, and regional temperature anomalies of up to +40 °C during
the deep cold season overlay some of [[the largest areas of
**carbon-rich permafrost**]{.underline}]{.mark} (\>100 kg m−2)47.
Measurements from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost suggest
that, between 2007 and 2016, continuous permafrost in the top 3m
[[throughout the Arctic warm]{.mark}ed **[0.39]{.mark}**±0.15**[°C on
average]{.mark}**]{.underline}48 (Fig. 1b), raising concerns about the
rapid rate of thaw and potential old carbon release5,49--55. Where
peatlands and permafrost overlap, [deeply buried carbon within is
increasingly at risk from **warming**]{.underline}, and a substantial
loss of Yedoma could potentially result in a 50% increase in the PCF by
2100 (refs35,40,55). Additionally, [[while]{.mark} peatlands
[**currently** function as a **carbon sink**]{.mark}]{.underline},
continued [[warming could thaw]{.mark} an estimated 0.8 to [**1.9

**permafrost [carbon release]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} up to
**[50%]{.mark}**]{.underline}56.

Incorporating contemporary warming, model simulations predict a total
loss of near-surface permafrost (0--3m) ranging from 0.2 to 58.8×103km2
per year7 . This estimate reflects a loss of 3--5 million km2 permafrost
in the RCP4.5 scenario and 6--16 million km2 for RCP8.5 by 2100

Permafrost distribution and carbon stocks. [[Permafrost]{.mark}

planet]{.underline}9 . An estimated [[13--**18 million**]{.mark} km2 of
permafrost is [in the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}31, 1.06 million
km2 is on the Tibetan Plateau32 and 16--21 million km2 is submerged in
the subsea33 (Fig. 1a). However, the underlying depth, structure and
status of permafrost remain challenging to quantify34. Cataloguing
Pleistocene-aged Yedoma permafrost is particularly difficult, due to its
general depth (below \>3m) and thickness (often covering \>40m), with
current estimates of its areal extent at \~1 million km2 (ref.35).
Regardless, understanding its distribution is critical to predicting the
future PCF35--38. [[Yedoma contains]{.mark} up to 90% ice per

Particulates emitted]{.mark} from wood-burning stoves [in places like
South Asia can affect the Arctic, but those **emitted locally** have a
**larger impact**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This is why the actions of Russia, whose northern regions account for
two-thirds of Arctic economic activity despite accounting for only half
of the region's landmass, can alter the fate of the entire circumpolar
North. The country's efforts to reduce gas flaring and emissions from
transportation in recent years have been shown to reduce radiative
forcing, or the amount of energy entering the atmosphere. At the same
time, Russia will continue to burn heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic
until 2029---the last possible moment under International Maritime
Organization (IMO) regulations. The IMO recently voted to ban HFO in the
Arctic to reduce black carbon levels, with voluntary restrictions
beginning in 2024 and mandatory ones in 2029. The five-year "grace
period" was included partly as a concession to Russia, which had opposed
the restrictions altogether. (Canada, too, does not plan to immediately
implement the HFO ban in 2024.)

Another LAP of note is algae. [As warmer spring and summer temperatures
hasten **melting** on the Arctic's snow and ice surfaces, **algae** that
lay dormant in the ice during winter venture up to the surface, where
they **bloom** in grimy green, pink, and gray. Exposure to sunlight
**darkens** the algae, [which **accelerates melting** of the ice]{.mark}
beneath.]{.underline} Climate change is also increasing wind speeds,
leading to greater transport of phosphorus, a naturally occurring
ingredient used in fertilizer. This trend is feeding the annual algal
blooms as well. One portion of the Greenland ice sheet has become so
covered in algae that scientists refer to it as "the dark zone," a
phenomenon that has increased in size and duration over the past two
decades.

can't do anything in space without some kind of emissions, and so you
have to make those trades. Fortunately, with space travel, usually the
missions that you're doing and the services that you're providing
outweigh the cost significantly. I tend to think that putting stuff in
space is like building infrastructure. If we put a satellite into orbit
to do weather prediction, for example, that small machine provides
weather details and data to literally millions of people around the
planet. So you can have a really big impact for a relatively small piece
of infrastructure. Whereas if you build a road in a city, it's only the
people who live in that area and have access to it who benefit.

But [**[Arctic shipping]{.mark}** is not only made possible by the
climate crisis, it is adding to it too. More ships [mean a rise in
**exhaust fumes**, which]{.mark} is [accelerat]{.mark}ing ice melt in
this sensitive region due to a complex phenomenon involving "**[black
carbon]{.mark}**"]{.underline}, an air pollutant formed by the
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.

When black carbon, or soot, lands on snow and ice, it dramatically
speeds up melting. Dark snow and ice, by absorbing more energy, melts
far faster than heat-reflecting white snow, creating a vicious circle of
faster warming.

Environmentalists warn that [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
warming four times faster than the global average, [[has seen an **85%
rise** in black carbon from ships]{.mark} between 2015 and 2019, mainly
[because of the increase]{.mark} in **oil tankers** and **bulk
carriers**]{.underline}.

The particles, which exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illness
in towns, are short-term but potent climate agents: they represent more
than 20% of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from ships, according to
one estimate.

Yet unlike other transport sectors, including road, rail and inland
waterways, where air-quality standards curb emissions, [**[no
regulations exist]{.mark}** for shipping]{.underline}. Last November,
[[the]{.mark} International Maritime Organization (**[IMO]{.mark}**)
[adopted a resolution on]{.mark} the use of [cleaner fuels]{.mark} in
the Arctic to reduce black carbon, [but left it]{.mark} as a
**[voluntary]{.mark}** move]{.underline}.

Last week, the IMO was once again in the spotlight. A coalition of
environmental groups warned a meeting of its pollution, prevention and
response subcommittee that its resolution did too little to tackle the
Arctic's climate crisis. They submitted a paper calling on governments
to agree mandatory regulations to slash shipping's emissions of black
carbon in the region.

"We're hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate," said Dr
Lucy Gilliam, senior shipping policy officer of Seas at Risk. "With the
IPCC report, we are seeing again why we need to do something about black
carbon urgently."

Last Monday, scientists from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) warned it was "now or never" for action to stave off
climate breakdown. They concluded that the international community was
underperforming on climate commitments, but singled out the shipping
sector and the IMO for particular criticism.

The pollution from global shipping increased by 4.9% in 2021, according
to a report by the shipbrokers Simpson Spence Young.

"IMO member states must agree on ambitious and urgent global action to
dramatically reduce ship-source black carbon emissions this decade, in
order to mitigate the climate crisis in the Arctic," said Dr Sian Prior,
lead adviser to the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 21 non-profit
groups lobbying governments to protect Arctic wildlife and people. She
urged states and regions to do their part by acting immediately to cut
black carbon from ships.

If all shipping using heavy fuel oil in the Arctic switched to cleaner
distillate fuel, it would cut their black carbon emissions by 44%, the
Alliance said. Heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel is a viscous, low-grade,
cheap oil contaminated with substances including nitrogen and sulphur,
which make it more polluting than distillate.

If all ships also installed diesel particulate filters, which reduce
emissions by capturing and storing soot, black carbon could be cut by a
further 90%.

However, others argue that the IMO's 2021 ban on heavy fuel oils in the
Arctic -- a move aimed at reducing the risk of spillage and expected to
come into effect in 2029 -- will see a reduction in black carbon.

"The tide is swimming in the same direction already," said Paul
Blomerus, director of Clear Seas: Centre for Responsible Marine
Shipping, an independent research institute in Canada funded by industry
and government. "Many Canadian-flagged ships are moving towards
distillate fuels, ahead of the IMO ban, which will have the added effect
of reducing black carbon emissions.

"You could argue that the IMO only has a certain amount of bandwidth and
we should concentrate on decarbonisation and how to get to net zero by
2050."

He also [[note]{.mark}d [the major role that **Russia** play]{.mark}ed
[in Arctic shipping. "Whether they]{.mark} would [**abide** by the
**IMO's regulation** is **anyone's guess**]{.mark} in the current

Modelling. Despite the advances in measuring and monitoring permafrost
carbon dynamics, efforts to model Arctic changes lag. However, some
notable progress has been made. [[In the past 10 years, models have
produced the **first reliable forecasts** of permafrost carbon
release]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios,
[[**15 model simulations all predicted a total loss** of near-surface
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} (less than 3 m deep) [over the region by
2100]{.underline}, with differences in the magnitude of loss rates among
the models (0.2 to 58.8×103km2 per year)7 (Fig. 4). The simulations
indicated a total loss of 3 to 5 million km2 permafrost (mean loss 4PgC)
in the RCP4.5 scenario and 6 to 16 million km2 (mean loss 341PgC) for
the RCP8.5 scenario. An increase in future net primary productivity is
modelled to increase vegetative carbon storage from 156 to 954 TgC per
year between 2010 and 2299. However, the [modelled vegetation carbon
[gains were **not substantial enough** to **compensate** for]{.mark}
even larger soil carbon [losses under]{.mark} RCP8.5, [the **current
Arctic trajectory**]{.mark}]{.underline}7 . The magnitude of this offset
is limited by temperature and nutrients, with wide variation in models
projecting CO2 plant uptake7,89,146,147 (Fig. 5).

Similarly, models focusing on small-scale permafrost processes forecast
an increase of \~12 times current carbon release by 2100 under RCP8.5
(ref.64). Deepening active layer thaw estimates for this period ranged
from one to eight times deeper relative to 2020, even without
considering ground subsidence in regions with high ice content64. [As
models are refined, patterns of abrupt thaw emerge more

and environmental degradation. Other drivers of biodiversity loss
include habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution and
overexploitation of species and resources (IPBES, 2019). Dasgupta (2021)
reviews the extensive dependence of human society on ecosystem services;
[substantial global harm is to be expected from the degradation of these
services, although a **direct path** to human **extinction** is **not
outlined**]{.underline}. Surveying the literature Kareiva and Carranza
(2018) [note a "growing scepticism regarding the strength of evidence
linking trends in biodiversity loss to an existential risk for humans,"
arguing that in the absence of unlikely circumstances such as 90% of
biodiversity being lost, human civilisation would survive]{.underline}.
Ord (2020) argues that ongoing environmental damage is a source of
unknown threats to humanity and that more research is needed.

Under scenarios of unsustainable anthropogenic activity, widescale
pollution, resource depletion, soil erosion, deforestation and other
consequences of [[human activity may make]{.mark} global
[civilisation]{.mark} considerably [**less resilient**, but a direct
link to **full extinction appears implausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Concerns have been raised about the widespread release of chemicals that
may be harmful to human health; in particular endocrine disruptors,
which have been linked to fertility decline (Gonsioroski et al., 2020;
Swan and Colino, 2022). While it is premature to consider these
extinction threats, more research is needed on their impacts on
populations and reproductive health. Conversely, concerns have been
raised for half a century that rising global population might lead to
civilisational collapse (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 2009); however, research
increasingly suggests that global population will peak and begin to
decline within this century (Adam, 2021).

Understanding carbon across scales [As the Arctic rapidly **changes**,
[the **scientific community** has sought to expand its **capacity to
monitor, understand and predict** transformation and carbon
**release**]{.mark}]{.underline}60,94,95. Instrumentation designed to
sample across spatial and temporal scales has improved understanding of
abrupt thaw dynamics26,27, the age and impact of released carbon3,35,96,
the effects of changing Arctic hydrology63,97 and the importance of
technological integration in forecasting future dynamics98,99.

[**[Detection]{.mark}** of carbon release [spans multiple scales
and]{.mark} integrates **data** from **multiple
[methodologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (TABLE 1). For example, land plots
and flux chambers are used to quantify and characterize carbon release
from specific environments at the 1--10-m scale76. Eddy covariance (EC)
towers monitor surface--atmosphere fluxes of carbon, water and energy on
scales of 100--1,000 m (REF.67). At regional to continental levels, tall
tower networks complemented by larger-scale aircraft campaigns deliver
carbon release information on 10--1,000-km scales100. For observation
scales \>1,000 m, [[a growing number of]{.mark} satellite
**[sensors]{.mark}** monitor surface and atmospheric variables that [can
be used to infer carbon flux across the **entire
Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}101--103. [This combination of observations
and model scenarios across scales **[provides a picture of rapid
thaw]{.mark}** and an abrupt loss of carbon]{.underline} (FIG. 2), [on
the order of **decades** or less]{.underline}.

Laboratory-based research. Laboratory-based research (usually on samples
collected in the field) has produced important information on the
dynamics of permafrost microbial communities, including the myriad
survival strategies that have preserved extremophile permafrost microbes
for up to a million years in stasis. These adaptations include the
production of carotenoids104, high abundance of stress-response
genes105, lipid-rich membrane fluidity106, dormancy105,107 and DNA
repair108,109.

DNA-based analyses, including metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
have illuminated adaptations, origins, metabolic potential and microbial
community composition in representative permafrost samples70,110,111.
However, these analyses do not distinguish between live and dead cells,
which is critical to determining the carbon transformation potential of
microorganisms112. Therefore, advances in live--dead staining and
endospore enrichment with conditions controlling for pH, acidity and
carbon concentration are increasingly critical to determine the carbon
transformation potential of permafrost microbial communities112--114.

Incubation of permafrost and permafrost-affected soil samples is another
method used to understand microbially mediated carbon release. Carbon
release was 3.4 times higher in aerobic conditions than in anaerobic
conditions in permafrost incubations115. A greater loss of permafrost
carbon is, therefore, predicted for oxic conditions by laboratory
assessments and modelling. However, as this loss is expected to be
primarily in the form of CO2 emissions, an equal amount of released CH4
under anaerobic conditions has considerably more warming potential60.
The increase in activity from reactivated microorganisms in anoxic
conditions could increase carbon emissions across the Arctic by 27--38
TgCH4 per year by 2100, effectively doubling current CH4 emissions85.
[Therefore, [**determining** the **processes** driving the degradation

[As the world warms, we will begin to approach **tipping points**,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming]{.underline} (Lenton et al. 2019). [Could tipping
points put us on an irreversible course towards existential
catastrophe]{.underline} by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, [[tipping
points need to be **contextualized** within]{.mark} our understanding of
[specific mechanisms]{.mark}, such as [**sea level rise**, **heat
stress**]{.mark} and **[crop failure]{.mark}**, by which climate change
could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen that [even the most
**outlandish warming scenarios do not pose a credible threat of
existential catastrophe** through any of these]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline}. So [[even]{.mark} if tipping points raise [the
probability of **extreme warming**]{.mark}, it is [not]{.mark} clear
that they [provide a]{.mark} **new and [credible pathway towards
existential catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that [[no]{.mark}ne of these
[tipping point]{.mark}s [presents a **credible threat**]{.mark} of human
extinction]{.underline}. I will review a few representative examples
below. (Interested readers are invited to consult Chapter 8 of the
Halstead report).

Begin with [[dieback of the Amazon **rainforest**]{.mark} in the tropics
[and **boreal forests** near the arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both
forests play an important role in trapping carbon, preventing it from
reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that [boreal forest dieback is likely to
be something of **[a wash]{.mark}**. As the world warms, the
southernmost reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support
existing forests. But at the same time, boreal forests will expand
northwards into land that was previously too cold to support them. For
this reason, boreal [forest dieback is **not expected to pose a
significant existential threat**]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most tropical
forests fluorished during the Eocene period, in which periods were more
than 10°C hotter than they are today. So there is no ready inference
from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the Amazon
rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon dieback is expected to
contribute about 0.3°C of additional warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But an
existential catastrophe? Certainly not.

[What about [arctic permafrost]{.mark}?]{.underline} A great deal of
carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and as the world
warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon into the
atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, the IPCC currently projects that
each 1°C of warming will lead to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released
from arctic permafrost. That is roughly two percent of the amount
projected to be released by 2100 on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP
4.5) by the IPCC. As before, [this [is a **regrettable catastrophe, but
hardly an existential threat**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2\. Rising sea levels

As the world warms, sea levels begin to rise. This, Halstead notes,
carries many threats to human civilization. Most obviously, coastal
areas can become permanently submerged underwater. Perhaps less
obviously, coastal areas will also see increased flooding, erosion,
ecosystem loss, salinization of water and soil, and impaired drainage of
coastal waterways.

Some cities have already experienced a preview of what is to come. In
fact, Halstead notes, many cities have seen rises as sharp as 2-4 meters
in average sea levels. For example, here are some of the figures that
Halstead cites:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

These changes have been difficult to cope with. Global warming may have
contributed to the catastrophic flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina, and Tokyo has taken costly action to adapt to rising sea
levels. But they have not killed, nor even displaced, the vast majority
of city residents in either city.

To put these numbers in perspective, here are the IPCC projections for
sea level rise, not just by 2100, but all the way out to 2300, across a
variety of warming scenarios:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

This is horrible. In particular, it illustrates a point nicely stressed
by Halstead: [we should not put so much focus on climate impacts
**before 2100**, because many impacts, such as [rising sea
levels]{.mark}, [will get significantly worse beyond 2300 even if we get
emissions under control]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[But it is also **survivable**]{.mark}. We saw that [many cities have
already coped with sea level rises comparable to the absolute
**worst-case** rise]{.mark} in global mean sea levels projected by the
IPCC, not just in 2100, but in 2300.]{.underline}

This is not to say that everyone will cope. In fact, many of the world's
poorest will be forced from their homes and cities. Here Halstead cites
Here Halstead cites projections by Lincke and Hinkel (2021) of migration
during the 21st century caused by sea level rise across best, worst and
median warming scenarios:

\[TABLE REMOVED\]

This is a great human tragedy, concentrated largely in Asia and
disproportionately affecting the world's poorest nations. But [it is
**not an existential catastrophe**]{.underline}. Human civilization will
not end if millions, or tens of millions are forced to migrate.

It may seem that some experts expect rising sea levels to pose an
existential risk in this century. Lobbying by effective altruists has
spread the language of existential risk as far as the UN Secretary
General's Common Agenda. And it appears that even the IPCC has been
moved to use the term:

As the scale and pace of sea level rise accelerates beyond 2050,
long-term adjustments may in some locations be beyond the limits of
current adaptation options and for some species and some locations could
be an existential risk in the 21st century (medium confidence).

IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Technical Summary, p. 94

But the term has already been qualified (for some locations, and some
localities). In the rest of this passage, the IPCC clarifies exactly
what it means.

Nature-based interventions, for example wetlands and salt marshes, can
reduce impacts and costs while supporting biodiversity and livelihoods
but have limits under high warming levels and rapid sea level rise (high
confidence). Ecological limits and socioeconomic, financial and
governance barriers will be reached first and are determined by the type
of coastline and city or settlement (medium confidence). Accommodation
can reduce impacts on people and assets but can address only limited sea
level rise. Considering the long term now will help to avoid maladaptive
lock-in, to build capacity to act in a timely and pre-emptive manner and
to reduce risks to ecosystems and people.

IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Technical Summary, p. 94

That's quite a bit tamer than what effective altruists mean when they
speak of an existential risk.

There is every cause for concern about rising sea levels. That is
especially true for the inhabitants of coastal areas, some of whom may
be forced to abandon their settlements in this century. But [[nothing
approaching human **extinction** or]{.mark} the [permanent
**curtailment**]{.mark} of our potential for **future development** [has
even a **slight chance** of resulting from **rising sea levels**]{.mark}
in this century.]{.underline}
