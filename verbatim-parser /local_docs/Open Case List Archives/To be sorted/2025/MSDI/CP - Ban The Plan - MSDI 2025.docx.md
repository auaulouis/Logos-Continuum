## Notes

This is a tradeoff DA inside a mutually exclusive counterplan!

The [internal net-benefit]{.underline} is US-China war. The story goes
that China is waiting for us to turn our backs to get even more
aggressive in the Indo-Pacific region, so if we invest time, resources,
and attention into the Arctic through the plan, that triggers China's
confidence. The resulting war goes nuclear, etc. The CP avoids that by
NOT doing the Aff and banning any Arctic movement that would distract
the US and link to the Indo-Pacific scenario.

Additionally, any case turns you read are [net-benefits]{.underline} to
the CP since it bans the Aff.

The CP [solves the Aff]{.underline} via NATO fill in. Duffy, et al.,
advocates for Nordic NATO countries taking over the Arctic burden so
that the US can turn its attention back to the Indo-Pacific. The idea is
that if the US prohibited Arctic development, that would send signals
that cause other NATO countries to fill in (as they already sort of
are.)

If the Aff has any scenarios on constraining / checking Russia in the
Arctic, there is a little solvency trick contained in the 1NC. The
Duffy, et al., card specifies that Nordic NATO countries are best suited
for Arctic moves because the US is really unprepared and incapable of
doing much of anything. Sort of a hidden solvency argument that might go
unaddressed.

The Arctic becoming a strategic battleground was explicitly acknowledged
in June 2024 through the U.S. Department of Defense's Arctic Strategy,
noting growing Russian-Chinese collaboration. Despite major combat
losses in Ukraine, Russia continues to expand its Arctic military
presence and activities. [[The Arctic's]{.mark} unique [environment
requires **specialized training** and **equipment**, posing **challenges
for the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates** in projecting and
sustaining military forces in the region. [This task is further
complicated by the American **strategic focus on countering
China**]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [[NATO represents an
ideal form of Arctic burden-sharing, allowing the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to **concentrate elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[As the Trump admin]{.mark}istration **[pivots back to
Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, maintaining strong NATO ties is crucial,
despite rhetoric to the contrary. NATO has been tying its strategic
survival to an Indo-Pacific pivot since 2019, and the Trump
administration will need to rely more on Arctic-minded NATO allies to
deter Russian and Chinese ambitions. [[The]{.mark} U.S. [military has
**minimal** forces capable of operating in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} but also needs to defend its space-based
infrastructure around the region. By leveraging NATO, particularly the
Arctic expertise of British, Canadian, and Nordic allies, the United
States can ensure a stable Arctic presence, enabling a robust military
posture in the Indo-Pacific.

The Strategic Importance of the Arctic

The Arctic has become a unique arena of global competition. It is the
sole area of the world where both Russia and China operate in close
proximity to North America across various domains. Melting sea ice and
technological advances have increased accessibility, transforming the
Arctic from a "strategic buffer" to a hotspot for valuable resources
like oil, gas, rare earth minerals, and new fisheries, as well as
opening shorter sea routes between Europe and Asia. This increased
accessibility unlocks immense economic potential, including an estimated
90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil, 30 percent of the world's
undiscovered natural gas, and \$1 trillion in rare earth minerals.
However, these opportunities bring heightened competition, where the
growing Chinese and Russian presence directly challenges U.S. and NATO
interests.

The Arctic has long been central to Russia's identity and security,
controlling 53 percent of Arctic coastline, and its Arctic policy
identifies its economic and security needs. As the ice melts, the region
becomes a real security concern for both Russia and the United States.
The Arctic is crucial to Russia's economy, accounting for 10 percent of
Russian GDP and 20 percent of exports. Russia has expanded its military
footprint, reopening Soviet-era bases, deploying advanced missile
systems, and investing in nuclear-powered icebreakers. The Kola
Peninsula, home to most of Russia's ballistic missile submarines,
underscores the Arctic's role in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy.
Moreover, Russia attempts to control the Northern Sea Route, challenging
international norms of freedom of navigation, posing a direct threat to
NATO's Northern Flank and member states' economic interests.

China's Arctic activities further complicate the security landscape.
Despite not being an Arctic nation, China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and seeks influence through its Polar Silk Road
initiative. These efforts, often dual-use, support military objectives.
Sino-Russian joint Arctic exercises, including coast guard and naval
patrols as well as joint bomber patrols, demonstrate increased military
alignment against the United States. They pose a strategic challenge to
NATO and the defense of the American homeland, by combining Russia's
military presence with China's economic and technological capabilities.

NATO's Valuable Arctic Expertise

Converging Russian and Chinese interests both in and beyond the Arctic
requires the United States to work by, with, and through allies to
counter threats in the region. [Traditionally, the United States has
enjoyed unrivaled military dominance, but in the Arctic, it now faces an
**emerging alliance** between two formidable competitors]{.underline}.
This situation underscores the need for a collaborative approach with
NATO allies to ensure preparedness for a crisis in the Arctic. American
dominance cannot be taken for granted. [In the Arctic, [U.S.
capabilities are **not enough** to counter Russia, let alone a
Sino-Russian alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Per our recently published research, [successful military operations in
the Arctic require not only **specialized equipment** but also
**dedicated training** and doctrine for polar warfare. [Arctic
operations are **uniquely challenging**]{.mark}, with complex logistics,
extreme weather, and seasonal shifts like polar days and nights.
Accordingly, building Arctic-ready forces requires "the deliberate
education and development of Arctic-minded leaders alongside
collaboration with allies and partners to foster enhanced cold weather
war-fighting capabilities across the spectrum." Arctic warfighting
requires more than just specialized equipment --- rather, it demands the
dedicated attention of those troops who will be assigned to conduct
it]{.underline}. Lessons learned from previous Arctic conflicts include
the need for cold weather warfare training and equipment, dedicated
polar war-fighting doctrine, joint operations, interoperability,
mobility in Arctic conditions, planning for increased supplies and
unique logistics, Arctic domain awareness and intelligence, space
weather disrupting command and control, inimitable polar weather issues
associated with polar days and nights, controlling Arctic sea lines of
communication, and ensuring unity of command.

Fortunately, [[**NATO** already has much of the necessary infrastructure
in place]{.mark} with the **Nordics**]{.underline}. For instance, the
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force was established in 2014 and
emphasized Arctic warfare capabilities with Nordic military forces in
the High North. More recent developments include the establishment of a
NATO Multi-Corps Land Component Command in Finland, the formation of a
Nordic Air Force, and the creation of a NATO Commander Task Force Baltic
in the German port city of Rostock. All reflect a boost in NATO's
cohesion, capability, and communication, helping establish the "3 Cs of
Deterrence" around the Arctic Circle.

[[NATO's role in defending the Arctic]{.mark} has grown increasingly
vital, and the alliance [can capitalize on the polar expertise of its
**Arctic countries**]{.mark}. [Canada, Denmark]{.mark} (Greenland),
[Norway, Sweden,]{.mark} and [Finland]{.mark} are highly trained in
cold-weather warfare, have a deep understanding of Arctic operations,
and are geographically positioned to respond quickly to threats in the
region. Moreover, the Nordic countries are jointly negotiating the
procurement of an infantry fighting vehicle specifically for the
subarctic climate]{.underline}.

Finland's expertise in Arctic warfare can be traced to the Winter War
(1939--1940), when it held off a numerically superior Soviet invasion
force longer and better than expected due to superior tactics adapted to
its unique Arctic environment, before ultimately losing. Finland's
contributions to NATO include substantial ground forces and long-range
fires. Likewise, Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold
Weather Operations. Sweden's recent ascension to NATO bolsters the air
capabilities and industrial base of the alliance while Denmark's Joint
Arctic Command provides critical presence, experience, and capability.
Canada has long been a key U.S. partner in the Arctic as a part of the
bi-national North American Air Defense Command.

Filling Gaps in the Ice

While Canada and the Nordics specialize more in Arctic warfighting, NATO
still faces significant military capability gaps in the Arctic. To
effectively counter potential aggression from Russia and China in the
Arctic, NATO needs to strengthen its ability to conduct a range of
specialized military operations in the Arctic including long-range
fires, multi-domain awareness, air and missile defense, attack aviation,
amphibious operations, and the logistical sustainment of resilient
forces capable of enduring prolonged engagements in harsh polar
conditions.

NATO faces specific challenges in Arctic naval readiness, particularly
in ice-capable vessels and icebreakers, which are an "important element
of Arctic sovereignty." Russia holds a clear advantage with 46
icebreakers, Project 22100 Ocean Patrol Vessels, and its new ice-capable
Project 23550 ships. These vessels offer Russia a massive Arctic
advantage enabling superior presence and mobility. NATO should focus on
building additional vessels like Canada's Harry DeWolf Arctic Offshore
Patrol Ships and an updated version of Denmark's Thetis-class frigates.
The recently penned collaborative ICE Pact between the United States,
Canada, and Finland is a step in the right direction for bolstering
their respective industrial bases to build more icebreakers.
Additionally, partnerships with non-NATO allies that have icebreakers,
such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, could support NATO operations
in the Arctic if needed in a crisis. For current gaps in Arctic
coverage, NATO needs more anti-access and area denial capabilities to
pose a credible threat to Russian operations. NATO needs to embark on a
sustained investment campaign to bolster its Arctic deterrence
capabilities both on land and at sea in the Arctic.

Minimal Arctic Capabilities

The United States needs NATO for Arctic stability, due to struggles in
committing tangible resources to the Arctic besides more hollow
strategies. Increasing Arctic-specific training, expanding icebreaking
capabilities, and enhancing interoperability with Canada, the Nordics,
and Arctic-minded countries (such as the United Kingdom) are essential
steps for projecting force in the Arctic. Training exercises like Arctic
Edge and the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center Rotation 24-02
demonstrate progress but should be scaled up to counter the threat posed
by the growing Sino-Russian alliance. The United States also maintains
critical Arctic installations --- including Pituffik Space Base in
Greenland, which serves as a critical hub for missile defense and
satellite communications --- but more Arctic bases are needed to
effectively compete in the region. Similarly, the U.S. Army established
the 11th Airborne Division "Arctic Angels" in 2022 at Anchorage, Alaska,
with 11,000 soldiers focused on extreme cold weather operations.
However, it is problematic that this unit maintains "readiness for
global deployments ... \[and\] for large-scale combat operations" when
it should be wholly focused on polar warfare. Worse, the unit struggles
with numerous internal morale issues.

The United States ought to go further in building its Arctic
capabilities, by ramping up its Arctic-specific training programs and
investing in research and development aimed at enhancing cold-weather
operational capabilities. This includes expanding its fleet of
icebreakers, which is currently insufficient to conduct the necessary
peacetime missions, let alone support a potential conflict in the
region. However, these initiatives are unlikely due to the Arctic being
a low priority under current global force management postures. Ruthless
defense prioritization means the Arctic will likely continue to be
neglected, despite growing risks. Thus, the United States should foster
greater cooperation with its NATO Arctic allies, particularly Canada and
the Nordics, to ensure a coordinated and effective response to any
potential crisis in the region. Undergirding that should be civil
society engagement with indigenous populations around the Arctic Circle
in a mutually beneficial way to ensure their security and to partner
with them to increase Arctic domain awareness.

A Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic

[Canada, the Nordics, [and other Arctic-minded allies should **lead NATO
in Arctic defense as the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates [pivots to
counter China]{.mark}** in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [The combined
Sino-Russian threat is global, and the United States needs allies to
share the burden of defense]{.underline}. The United States and NATO
should leverage the expertise of Arctic allies to establish a Nordic-led
Arctic-focused Combined Joint Expeditionary Force within NATO, allowing
the alliance to establish a dedicated force as a credible deterrent in
the Arctic.

Forming a Nordic-led Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic
would reduce the strain on U.S. forces. NATO lacks an Arctic strategy
other than an October 2024 statement about defending "Allied interests
in the Arctic." NATO needs a comprehensive Arctic strategy that leads to
investments in infrastructure, training, and equipment to match Russian
power in the Arctic. Without proper resourcing, Russia will keep
dominating the Arctic, making it less safe for international trade,
freedom of navigation, and rule of law. Sino-Russian dominance of the
Arctic has severe implications for global security and economic
stability. Through collective action and improved Arctic-specific
readiness, [[NATO can deter]{.mark} Sino-[Russian aggression in the
Arctic while supporting a **U.S. shift** to the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates desperately [needs to plan for a
**long war in the Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} **region**]{.underline}.

A troubling gap exists between US industrial capacity and the production
requirements to sustain and win a war with China. While such assessments
generally focus on shipbuilding due to the maritime focus of conflict
scenarios, the same disparity exists in military platforms across all
domains of warfare, such as aircraft, armor, ground-based air defense
systems, and others. Defense analysis on these myriad gaps is abundant,
but most evaluations are piecemeal in nature, focusing only on a single
platform or domain, rather than taking a holistic approach to the
problem.

This disjointed assessment is compounded by the lack of a rigorous
analysis of the wartime manpower requirements to operate new platforms.
Producing the ships, aircraft, and fighting vehicles to sustain a war
against China---which would almost certainly be protracted---isn't
enough. The platforms must also be manned and supported. A guided
missile destroyer, for example, requires a crew of more than three
hundred sailors. A single squadron of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters
requires hundreds of maintainers, air controllers, fuelers, and other
support personnel to remain operational. And while opening phases of a
war with China would predominantly be an air and maritime fight
involving ships, aircraft, and precision munitions, a long conflict
fought for years would likely require nearly one hundred divisions of
ground and amphibious forces from the US Army and Marine Corps.

Generating the personnel to man such a force would almost certainly
require a draft---and getting the numbers right is itself a complex
challenge that demands a delicate touch. The skill sets required for the
force must be balanced against the domestic workforce's nonmilitary
needs. Skilled laborers and trained knowledge workers will be needed in
abundance to sustain the production of a US war machine. In short,
properly planning a national mobilization for a long war with China is a
daunting task that has not yet been engaged in detail by the national
security community. Developing even a "plan to plan" for mobilization
can be overwhelming. Where should analysts start? Thankfully, history
provides a road map.

Lessons forged in war

In the final months leading up to the United States' involvement in
World War II, senior US policymakers noted a similar disparity between
military-industrial capacity and the requirements to mobilize the nation
for a war with Germany. After identifying US objectives in such a war
and the combat power of the enemy, planners calculated the number of US
combat divisions required to fight and win. This, in turn, enabled
estimates of matériel production and the skilled laborers needed for
military manufacturing. Comparing this to existing, peacetime US
industry, its labor force, and its draftable population, a program was
written for scaling up production while executing a military draft. The
result was the Victory Program, which forecasted the military forces,
their missions, and matériel requirements the United States would need
to defeat Germany with uncanny precision.

Quite simply, the United States needs a modern victory plan for a war
against China in the Indo-Pacific. Like its predecessor, this plan must
account for all requirements to win a protracted war and tap into all
forms of power available to the United States. For this plan to serve as
an effective deterrent, the plan and its rigor should be clearly
communicated to key leaders within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
While the scope of such a document would be wide and deep, the following
considerations are essential.

Good strategy starts with clear objectives

With the WWII Victory Program, lead planners first took care to
determine the nature of the problem they were trying to solve. This
enabled the identification of a national policy objective, facilitating
the development of an appropriate military strategy. It was only then
that planners were postured to estimate the military forces needed to
pursue that strategy and reach the determined objective. The Victory
Program took as its core assumption that US policy, should it be pulled
into the war, would be to eliminate totalitarianism from Europe and deny
imperial Japan control of the western Pacific. All other planning flowed
to support this core objective and anticipated US participation in a
long, global conflict.

In planning for a long war with China, US planners must frame the
problem appropriately. Too often, national security practitioners frame
war-games and exercises as short, decisive conflicts focused primarily
around Taiwan and in the "first island chain." But [[wars between
**great powers** are rarely **short**]{.mark} affairs and instead tend
to expand horizontally while grinding on for **years**. The hot wars
raging today in Ukraine and the Middle East bear testament to this
brutal reality]{.underline}.

As such, [a victory plan for a war against China demands framing the
problem in terms of a **global war**, with **several theaters** and
**multiple adversaries**, focused on destroying the military
capabilities of the CCP and its cobelligerents wherever they may be
encountered]{.underline}. The Victory Program was careful to consider
the "potential enemies" of the United States in its calculations, and a
modern victory plan must similarly consider horizontal escalation and
simultaneous fights against forces from Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

Sea power is essential---but not sufficient

The Victory Program was focused on building the army that the United
States would need, and it consequently assessed the number and types of
US Army divisions needed to fight per the plan's strategy. This task was
also scoped in terms of three key missions, described as hemispheric
defense, defending outlying possessions, and overseas task forces. An
Indo-Pacific victory plan would similarly need to identify the right
forces for the right missions.

While defeating the CCP's island-landing campaign against Taiwan will be
one mission, hemispheric defense, regional air defense, theater
sustainment, and other global missions will also inform US force
structure. Premier naval and amphibious forces will certainly be
required as more regionally focused war-games suggest, but the military
will also need forces capable of achieving dominance in all domains and
against other probable enemies of the United States.

At the same time, the types of forces and platforms needed will shift
depending on the phase of the war, enemy action, and the level of
support from allies and partners. For example, missile defense will see
more demand so long as the enemy maintains robust long-range strike
capabilities, but this may change if the enemy's precision munitions
begin to dwindle and its ability to replenish its magazines is denied.
Similarly, naval forces might be the nation's priority at the beginning
of the war, but ground forces that can seize, hold, and defend terrain
may become a greater requirement later in the war.

Achieving economic and industrial balance

Generating such forces doesn't just happen. In preparation for World War
II, a balance had to be sought to avoid undercutting the industrial and
farming base to keep the nation in the fight and on its feet, while also
conducting a draft of unprecedented scale to fill out the formations
needed to win. Notably, the first round of this draft occurred well
before the United States was itself involved in the hostilities raging
in Europe and the Pacific.

Similarly, the formations required for an Indo-Pacific victory plan
could only be filled by a large draft. Additionally, the warfighting
platforms, munitions, and other matériel needed for a protracted
struggle can only be produced by an informational and industrial base
manned by a critical mass of skilled workers. This poses the risk that
indiscriminate drafting could strip the work force of the skilled
workers essential to matérial production.

Planners must identify the key industrial bases the government needs to
mobilize and in turn determine which skilled workers should be retained
to support these bases, to avoid impairing US war-making potential.
Deliberate thought must be put into determining whether an individual is
more valuable to the war effort with a rifle in hand or on the
production line for munitions, ships, aircraft, and other essential
matérial.

Open discourse as a deterrent

[[While]{.mark} such [a planning effort is critical should a war occur,
it offers its greatest **deterrent** value if the CCP is **aware** of
its existence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The gaps in US readiness for a protracted war are many, known, and
widely discussed within US policy circles. While such open discourse is
a key strength of the US system and enables more honest assessments of
gaps and in turn a path for improvement, it could also exaggerate CCP
assessments of its own capability and will vis-à-vis the United States.
Put another way, the frequent and grim [[assessments by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [of its]{.mark}]{.underline} warfighting
[[shortfalls could]{.mark} feed into China's own campaign of public
opinion warfare, and [inflate China's **confidence** in its ability to
**win**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **deterrent effect** of any capability or redline is muted if the
adversary is ignorant of its existence. [The rigor and utility of
a]{.mark} new [US]{.mark} victory [plan for the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}
region [should]{.mark} not [be]{.mark} a hand of cards held close to the
vest, but [**laid out** on the table to demonstrate US resolve and
**long-term commitment**]{.mark} to such a struggle should it break out.
In this way, [the plan]{.mark} could help [tip the scales of deterrence
and **prevent** such a war from **breaking out at
all**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Writing the victory plan

The US national security establishment remains focused on planning for a
short, sharp war with China conducted around Taiwan in the first island
chain. But such a war between two great powers, like so many before,
will almost certainly become a long war of attrition. In planning for
such a conflict, the United States needs a new victory plan. In writing
this, planners should look to the Victory Program of World War II as a
model. This process began with problem framing at the global scale,
enabled estimates of the forces needed to win, and maintained the
industrial base and work force needed for matériel production. In
following this process, the United States could develop a credible plan
to win a protracted war in the Indo-Pacific region. [And in
[**strategically communicating** this plan]{.mark} to China, the United
States may **[prevent]{.mark} such [a catastrophic war from
occurring]{.mark}** in the first place]{.underline}.

**[Potential war and the US--China balance in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}**

The first step towards improving crisis management in the Western
Pacific is understanding the relevant features of US--China strategic
dynamics.

Russia's disastrous experience in the early phases of its invasion of
Ukraine since February 2022, the problems that Ukraine has experienced
in retaking territory and the current effective stalemate in that
theatre have strengthened the view that we live in a world of defence
dominance. In that view, the incentives for war are restrained because
successfully executing an offensive campaign (such as a territorial
conquest) seems very difficult or costly.19 The idea of an
offence--defence balance is a contested one among strategic studies
scholars (for instance, it isn't really possible to categorise specific
weapons as offensive or defensive), and it has to be emphasised that the
balance is a constantly evolving one.20 But it's nonetheless useful to
think about whether it's easier to take or defend territory at a
particular point in time.

The first reason for thinking that defence presently has an edge is the
continuing existence of nuclear weapons as part of the international
order. Put simply: some academics and strategists think that the risk of
escalation to nuclear exchange has permanently disincentivised offensive
action between nuclear-armed countries or blocs, although Cold War
strategists constantly debated the credibility of nuclear threats and
the possibility for conventional war below the nuclear threshold.21

Second, recent improvements in and proliferation of long-range sensors
and weapons appear to have significantly raised the cost of power
projection.22 In the air and sea domains, this is typically referred to
by the shorthand term 'anti-access/area-denial' (A2/AD). Recent
experiences have also shown the potential levels of lethality offered by
relatively cheap sensors such as small drones combined with massed
long-range surface fires in support of land manoeuvre.23 Australian
authors have written about this situation extensively, and acquisitions
across all three services reflect an appreciation of this problem set.24

At first glance, these fundamentals might seem reassuring. [The
**[US--China]{.mark}** relationship [is framed by]{.mark}]{.underline}
both the mutual possession of nuclear weapons, even if the US stockpile
is substantially larger at present,25 and the Western Pacific is an
operating environment conducive to the employment of A2/AD systems.

There are, however, [at least four important reasons to be
**[concern]{.mark}ed** about the potential [for]{.mark} inadvertent and
accidental **[escalation]{.mark}**, as well as **pre-emption**, [in
**regional crises**]{.mark}. In sum, they suggest that an overoptimistic
view of regional escalation pressures would be in error]{.underline}.

Uncertainty and the maritime domain

[The first reason for concern is [the nature of the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}, and specially the Western
Pacific]{.underline}. Most thinking on crisis stability and deterrence
has focused on the Cold War confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact along a European land border and the associated contours of the
US--USSR nuclear relationship. But [the Indo-Pacific is principally a
maritime theatre]{.underline}. It's been argued that the maritime domain
may be less prone to inadvertent escalation and disastrous
miscalculation. Ships are inherently mobile, and when they withdraw from
a confrontation that doesn't ipso facto represent the ceding of ground,
making a backdown more politically palatable.26 Another example is
submarine deployment, which is something rarely publicly signalled and
therefore withdrawable without loss of face. In other words, a level of
ambiguity about forces in the maritime domain, or an ability to shift
intent and narrative or maintain deniability, may offer opportunities
for maintaining stability.

But those same attributes of the maritime domain could also be
interpreted as reasons for concern. To begin with, [offence--defence
**[distinguishability is very low]{.mark}** at sea]{.underline}.27 For
instance, the Washington Conference in 1921--22, which was an attempt by
the major powers to limit the naval arms race, struggled to define
offensive capability. The vertical launching system (VLS) ubiquitous on
Western warships is a prime contemporary example of this problem. An
adversary doesn't know whether VLS cells contain anti-air missiles for
self-defence, land-attack missiles for long-range strike, or the
next-generation stealthy anti-ship missile currently under development
for the US military. Submarines and the contents of their magazines pose
a similar problem.

[And some analysts have noted that 'modern warships have glass
jaws'---that is, they're vulnerable, if not to sinking, then to being
put out of action by even a single missile or torpedo
hit]{.underline}.28 [This arguably leads to a dynamic in which
'whichever side completes the targeting chain first and fires first
almost always wins', and creates a **powerful incentive to
pre-empt**]{.underline}.29 In other words, ships that can be discovered
are very vulnerable. There can, therefore, be a major advantage in
shooting first when conflict seems imminent. [This suggests the
potential for maritime scenarios in which **escalation pressures are
very strong**]{.underline}.

[The longstanding naval preoccupation with presence can also be read as
the capacity to act with little warning, and sea power has specific
characteristics that produce **uncertainty and
ambiguity**]{.underline}.30

The doctrine and concepts underwriting the employment of naval platforms
reflect those features. The various iterations of US maritime
doctrine---air--sea battle, joint concept for access and manoeuvre in
the global commons (JAM-GC), now distributed maritime operations
(DMO)---are highly offensive ways of operating. Some analysts have
rightly noted this doctrine as escalatory. As Jonathan Caverley and
Peter Dombrowski have argued:

\[A\]t the minimum, it appears the USN will focus on destroying the PLAN
fleet and associated island bases in the South China Sea should a
conflict erupt. At the maximum, it, along with the \[US\] Air Force, is
preparing for a rapid, blinding assault on the Chinese mainland to
remove any Chinese capability for denying US access beyond the twelve
nautical miles of the territory the United States recognises as Chinese
...31

It isn't surprising that these concepts are so offensive in nature: the
US military is expected to develop options that offer the prospect of
military victory in a US--China conflict. Assuming that neither side
wishes to engage in nuclear war, the focus for analysis should be on
whether US and Chinese force structures and plans increase the risks of
inadvertent or accidental escalation, pre-emption and loss of control.
In other words, which features of the strategic dynamic between the US
and China raise the risk of escalation?

In short, [[contemporary naval capabilities are **ambiguous in intent
and nature**, creating the possibilities for]{.mark} inadvertent and
accidental [**escalation**, and]{.mark} the vulnerability of critical
capabilities in a missile exchange creates **[pressures for
pre-emption]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[New domains and novel technologies]{.underline}**

There's a great deal that we simply don't understand about space,
cyberspace, the contemporary information environment and a whole raft of
emerging technologies. Classic case studies like the July crisis of 1914
are richly instructive in some ways but have their limits in the 2020s;
knowing what to heed and what to ignore is tough at the best of times.

For example, would the targeting of space-based systems inevitably lead
to terrestrial escalation? Or, more specifically, what level of
degradation to space-based systems would each power be willing to
tolerate? To what extent do innovations such as autonomous weapon
systems and hypersonics further incentivise first strike? How will a
diffused, controlled and manipulated information environment inhibit
coherent and trusted communication between crisis actors? A complete
treatment of any one of those issues is beyond my scope here. Several
tentative implications will have to suffice.

There are some limited reasons for optimism. For instance, experience
thus far with uncrewed platforms seems to suggest that the targeting of
uncrewed systems isn't viewed with the same weight as the targeting of a
crewed platform.32 Even that norm, however, could (perversely) increase
the risk of escalation if it lowers the threshold for the use of force,
or if the two combatants have different assessments of the significance
of an attack on an uncrewed platform. And, as such systems proliferate
further and their spectrum of cost and capability grows, calculations
will change.

[There are, however, more substantive grounds for concern. Considering
cyber capabilities as an example, is it possible to target critical
parts of a nation's command-and-control architecture in a limited
fashion?33 How reliant are both the US and China on vulnerable
space-based command-and-control assets? Do the US and China adequately
understand potential linkages between their nuclear and conventional
command architectures?]{.underline}34 If autonomous weapon systems
facilitate fighting 'at machine speed', that seems [likely to generate
**escalation pressures and incentivise first (and multiple)
strike**]{.underline}.35

Moreover, our understanding of how accidents happen points to a linked
concern. [As the complexity of the weapons systems involved in the
military balance soars, we should expect more things to **go
wrong**]{.underline}.36 [More so-called 'normal **accidents'** will
indeed be normal]{.underline}.37

[**Hypersonics** are another important development]{.underline}. Russia,
China and the AUKUS partners (in Pillar 2 efforts, which complement
existing bilateral programs) are all in the process of developing and
deploying hypersonic weapon systems,38 and a test by the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) in 2021 reportedly surprised American analysts.39
[The significant launch signature of **[hypersonic weapons]{.mark}**
means warning will be still possible, as with traditional ballistic
missiles. But, depending on launch platform and location]{.underline}
(potentially VLS systems at sea), [the **time** from launch to target
may be **very short**]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, because those weapons [are **manoeuvrable**]{.mark} in
flight, [assessment of]{.mark} their **[intended target]{.mark}** will
be very [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This could [raise concerns
about **decapitation strikes**]{.mark} against national leadership or
critical military infrastructure, for example, **[incentivising 'hair
trigger' retaliatory postures]{.mark}**, potentially [including
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear force[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The risks are
accentuated by]{.mark} potential **ambiguity** over whether new
platforms such as hypersonic glide vehicles carry **conventional or
nuclear payloads** (referred to as '**[warhead
ambiguity]{.mark}**')]{.underline}. As James Acton has written, [**['Is
it a nuke?']{.mark}** once again becomes a key
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}.40 [And that question might be [asked
under **great pressure**]{.mark} and [with]{.mark} precious **[little
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Even ignoring nuclear concerns, as another analyst has observed,
'hypersonic weapons may be so difficult to intercept that they may usher
in an era of offence dominance in conventional-strike warfare'.41 [[The
incentive to **launch first**]{.mark} might therefore be [very strong
under **crisis conditions**]{.mark} in which war is widely believed to
be imminent]{.underline}.

In sum, [the interaction of newly prevalent domains and emergent
technologies under crisis conditions introduces a set of significant
unknowns into the mix, and technologies such as hypersonic glide
vehicles are likely to introduce strong **pre-emption
pressures**]{.underline}.

## Overview & Perms

### 2NC\-\--O/V

#### The US needs to put 100% focus on the Indo-Pacific to check China's aggression. The plan draws attention and resources away from this hotspot, building China's confidence in taking action because of a United States that's spread too thin. They're not afraid to sucker punch us, and that conflict eventually goes nuclear. Hypersonic weapons and the inherent ambiguity of the region means that first strike, retaliation, and escalation pressures are high.

Accessed 6.26.2025 // ***mosuQ***\]

[While delivering plenary remarks at a Singaporean security summit
today, **[Defense Secretary]{.mark} Pete [Hegseth]{.mark}**
[outlined]{.mark} to numerous Asian ally countries [DOD\'s vision for
the **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} region, while also [addressing the]{.mark}
strategic [threat posed by **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Speaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Shangri-La
Dialogue, [[Hegseth began]{.mark} his remarks [by **underscoring**
the]{.mark} Defense [Department\'s **priorities** of]{.mark} achieving
peace through strength by focusing on restoring the warrior ethos,
rebuilding the military and **[reestablishing
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The secretary then used the topic of deterrence --- noting,
specifically, that our allies around the world are beginning to invest
more in their self-defense --- to segue into speaking about the
**Indo-Pacific** region]{.underline}.

\"[[As our allies **share the burden**, we]{.mark} can **[increase our
focus on the Indo-Pacific: our priority
theater]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Hegseth said.

Stating the futures of the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific allies are \"bound
together,\" Hegseth said the security and prosperity of Americans are
linked to the security and prosperity of U.S. ally countries\' citizens.

\"We share your vision of peace and stability, of prosperity and
security and we are here to stay,\" he said.

The future vision for the Indo-Pacific is one \"grounded in common sense
and national interests,\" Hegseth said, where the U.S. and its allies
work together while respecting their mutual self-interests and engaging
on the basis of sovereignty and commerce, as opposed to war.

The secretary pointed out, [[as]{.mark} President Donald J. Trump
continues to lead [**European** allies]{.mark} to **[step up]{.mark}**
in [their self-defense, the U.S. can **then focus more resources on
the**]{.mark} **Indo-Pacific** [region]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"This enables all of us to benefit from the peace and stability that
comes with a lasting and strong American presence here in the
Indo-Pacific,\" Hegseth said.

\"These benefits, they only multiply when our allies and partners are
also strong,\" he added.

Regarding American influence in the region, Hegseth said the U.S. isn\'t
interested in the approach to foreign policy of the past.

\"We are not here to pressure other countries to embrace and adopt our
politics or ideology; we are not here to preach to you about climate
change or cultural issues; \[and\] we are not here to impose our will on
you. We are all sovereign nations,\" Hegseth said, adding the U.S. seeks
to work with its allies in areas where mutual interests align for peace
and prosperity.

\"On this sure foundation of mutual interests and common sense, we will
build and strengthen our defense partnerships to preserve peace and
increase prosperity,\" he said.

Pivoting to the threat China poses to the region, Hegseth made clear the
U.S. is not actively seeking conflict.

\"We do not seek conflict with communist China. ... But we will not be
pushed out of this critical region and we will not let our allies and
partners be subordinated and intimidated\" he said.

[Noting [China is]{.mark} \"[credibly **preparing** to use **military
force** to alter the **balance of power**]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific,\"
Hegseth said any attempt by China to **conquer** neighboring **Taiwan**
would result in \"devastating consequences\" not just for the
Indo-Pacific, but the entire world]{.underline}.

\"There\'s no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real,
and it could be imminent,\" Hegseth said, adding while nobody truly
knows what China might ultimately do, the U.S. and its allies must
nonetheless be ready with \"urgency and vigilance.\"

[While once again reiterating the U.S. seeks peace as opposed to war,
[Hegseth said the U.S. must]{.mark} also [be **prepared for armed
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"If deterrence fails --- and if called upon by \[the\] commander in
chief --- we are prepared to do what the Department of Defense does
best: to fight and win, decisively,\" he said.

Hegseth then revisited the topic of reestablishing deterrence in the
region.

The U.S. is working that line of effort in three ways, he said:
improving DOD\'s forward force posture, helping allies and partners
strengthen their defense capabilities and rebuilding U.S. and ally
countries\' defense industrial bases.

\"Across the board, the United States, our allies and our partners have
made great progress in these --- and many other --- areas toward
achieving peace through strength,\" Hegseth said.

\"But [[we have to do this **quickly**]{.mark}, and [we have **no time
to waste**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he added.

Hegseth wound down his remarks by emphasizing those who long for peace
must prepare for war, and the U.S. is looking to its partners and allies
in the Indo-Pacific to do just that.

\"[Our **[time is now]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Hegseth said, adding
[[the **threats** the U.S. and]{.mark} its [allies are facing **will not
wait**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"And **[nor can we]{.underline}**,\" he concluded.

Taiwan

[[Taiwan is]{.mark} probably [the most frequently cited]{.mark}
potential [**flashpoint** between **China and the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline}.74 [[A range of triggers could prompt a
crisis]{.mark} in or around the Taiwan Strait, including a unilateral
declaration of independence from Taipei]{.underline} (fairly unlikely to
happen), [or [a decision by **Beijing** to ratchet up
**military**]{.mark}, economic and political **[pressure]{.mark}**
(including interference) [on]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} even [to
**invade**]{.mark}, [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some analysis of
those possibilities has tended towards alarmism (given just how
difficult and costly an invasion of Taiwan would be),75 [war over Taiwan
remains a real possibility]{.underline}.

A direct attack against Taiwan would be a dramatically escalatory first
move from China. [Were [China]{.mark} seeking to invade and occupy
Taiwan, it [would]{.mark} need to [launch]{.mark} extensive and
overwhelming [**preliminary strikes** to facilitate access for
**amphibious transports**]{.mark} and major surface
vessels]{.underline}. We could expect cyberattacks on
command-and-control infrastructure and potential antisatellite attacks
(using either physical or cyber means). Those attacks may extend to US
systems, or even to US forces based in the region.76

[The US might respond to a direct Chinese attack on Taiwan in several
ways. The US's resolve to oppose the invasion directly would be stronger
were US forces, systems or its homeland targeted, but it's possible that
[the US]{.mark} might **[intervene militarily]{.mark}** even [if China
directed its initial campaign **only against
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, the US has sought to
maintain ambiguity about this calculation. Broadly speaking, a direct US
military response would involve US maritime forces manoeuvring in the
Western Pacific and striking Chinese capabilities, employing some
version of DMO. Such a direct US response has been critiqued as being,
in turn, highly escalatory because it's likely to be operationally
necessary for US strikes on Chinese capabilities (for example, on
mainland-based command-and-control architecture, missile launch sites
and so on) required to establish and maintain American freedom of
manoeuvre.77

Human frailty

Finally, [because [**human error** is an **ever-present risk**]{.mark},
we must not reduce any analysis of escalation risks to schematic
**rational calculations**]{.underline}.55

[[Leaders are]{.mark} often **[ego-driven]{.mark}**, and [public
sentiment and **emotions** shape]{.mark} individual [decision-makers'
environments]{.mark}. Analysts must make [shaky deductions from
**partial information**]{.mark}. [Commanders]{.mark} sometimes [do
downright **dangerous things**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the Cuban
missile crisis, Kennedy perceived Soviet actions in a highly
personalised way. In his mind, this was an attack on the President
himself: 'He can't do that to me!'56

[Sometimes things are done **[without
authorisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During the crisis precipitated by
the Soviet shootdown of KAL 007 in 1983, relatively junior US Air Force
officers dispatched combat aircraft from Japan to near the Soviet island
of Sakhalin, apparently with the unauthorised intention of provoking an
incident.57

The Cold War also saw a terrifying number of near-miss accidents with
nuclear weapons for other reasons, including many subjective decisions
to ignore early-warning systems, precipitated by anything from reflected
sunlight in satellite sensors to the mistaken use of exercise simulation
tapes in live systems.58

[The potential [integration of new forms of **automation** and]{.mark}
artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.mark}**) into command-and-control
[systems]{.mark}, both [**nuclear** and conventional]{.mark}, would
[affect]{.mark} those [decision-making processes]{.mark} in complex
ways]{.underline}. While this impact will be (and probably already is)
nuanced, one likely possibility seems to be the further compression of
decision-making time frames.59 The US has already publicly rejected
so-called 'dead hand' systems, which automate nuclear retaliation, and
which according to old Soviet theory strengthen deterrence.60 The US
doesn't share that view and has committed to a human in the loop in all
nuclear command and control. Discussion about the inclusion of greater
automation and AI in nuclear forces is only growing, though, especially
while there are concerns that one side might gain a significant
advantage by incorporating those technologies first.

There are whole libraries on the flaws and pitfalls of nuclear
decision-making under suboptimal, real-world conditions.61 The point
here is simply that [nothing has changed about the potential for the
[humans involved in]{.mark} such [high-stakes decisions]{.mark} to [do
terribly dangerous and ill-considered things]{.mark}. And there's a good
chance that [technological **innovations**]{.mark} could [**exacerbate**
rather than mitigate]{.mark} those **[human
frailties]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In summary, the ambiguity built into the maritime domain, [the
[uncertainty introduced by **new tech**]{.mark}nologies]{.underline},
ongoing unknowns in the US--China nuclear balance, [[and the]{.mark}
ever-present [potential for **human error**]{.mark} should [all]{.mark}
be [cause for **great and ongoing concern**]{.mark}. [Nothing about the
**nuclear** or broader military balance should be **assumed to be
stable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Particular concerns include the preference of some military planners
for **offensive action**]{.underline},62 [as well as the faith that
analysts believe **China** places in the **controllability of
escalation**, including below the level of 'war']{.underline}.63
Understanding those risks is important for policymakers in countries
like Australia.

#### Escalation is [possible]{.underline} and [dangerous]{.underline}\-\--there's a [laundry]{.underline} [list]{.underline} of [thresholds]{.underline} that could be crossed.

Salient thresholds

A range of thresholds might apply across these scenarios. The
[[**thresholds** could be crossed deliberately or through **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Salient thresholds include:

• targeting of mainland Chinese command-and-control architecture,
especially where those assets are entangled with China's nuclear
deterrent

• targeting of space-based capabilities, of either the US or China, when
the true significance or perceived value of a particular asset is not
appreciated (this is probably well understood for military assets, but
uncertainty might be significant for commercial assets that have
military utility, for example)

• targeting of mainland Chinese missile sites, particularly those that
house dual-use systems

• **[[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** on critical infrastructure of
a regional country, perceived as the preliminary action to a broader
offensive

• [[establishment of a **blockade**, by]{.mark} either the US or [China,
and subsequent]{.mark} decisions about the **[enforcement]{.mark}** of
any such blockade]{.underline}

• [**[movements of troops]{.mark}** and other relevant assets [by
China]{.mark} or by Taiwan, the US and allies, and [perceived to be
preliminary movements for **active military operational

be highly destabilising where there is no trust); this could include
[[preliminary movements for action **against Taiwan**]{.mark} **by
China**]{.underline}

• the movement of some certain configuration of strike assets into the
theatre by the US and allies, perceived by Beijing to be setting the
conditions for an offensive campaign; for example:

-- movement forward of strike aviation to the Philippines, Japan or
another location in the Western Pacific

-- movement forward of additional aircraft carriers or attack submarines
into the region well above peacetime baselines; the latter would surely
not be unambiguous, although Chinese subsurface detection capabilities
or broader intelligence collection could make this relevant to
decision-making

• US-led forces crossing some geographical threshold on the Korean
Peninsula, should a crisis have evolved to conflict or should
humanitarian intervention be occurring following a regime collapse

• the loss of a ship or ships with loss of life, by any involved state.
While regional strategists should be able to readily list scenarios like
these, they can't be confident about how either the US or China would
interpret such events as a threshold for a pre-emptive strike or other
forms of purposeful escalation.

[[**Accidental escalation** is]{.mark} also [a possibility]{.mark},
including via]{.underline}:

• [[an **accident at sea**]{.underline}]{.mark} between warships that
seriously damages a major surface combatant or combatants

• [**[loss of a sub]{.mark}marine** in ambiguous
circumstances]{.underline}

• an accident involving nuclear weapons, which might occur in third
countries or at sea if nuclear weapons systems have been forward
deployed

• sensor and computer errors, akin to the 'sunlight in satellites' and
similar cases experienced during the Cold War, leading military
commanders or national leaders to erroneously believe an attack is
taking place.86

[The [complex interactions between the sequence of events]{.mark}, the

[However, [East Asia has a **unique characteristic** when it comes to
strategic-level interactions]{.mark}. Unlike during the Cold War and the
case of the Korean Peninsula, in East Asia the main crucible of
interaction is located at sea. China and the United States have no
forces opposing each other on land, and with the exception of Taiwan
there are no arenas where the United States and China could clash that
have significant populated areas. This arguably **reduces the risk of a
clash** at sea spilling over onto land; therefore, [the **restraining
effect**]{.mark} of devastating war [that was operative during the Cold
War may be **weaker**]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} may [**allow** Chinese or
U.S. commanders the **freedom to escalate** a]{.mark} clash, given that
the potential strategic costs resulting therefrom would be
lessened]{.underline}. 74

However, while there is no existential threat, [[conflict
between]{.mark} the United States and China would mean conflict between
[the world's **two biggest economies**]{.mark} in some of the world's
most economically vital seas]{.underline}. This places pressure on both
sides to manage the instability caused by conflictual interactions. As
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated in 2017, "There cannot be
conflict between China and the United States, as both sides will lose
and both sides cannot afford that." 75

[Operationally, [the increasing presence]{.mark} and prominence
[of]{.mark} civilian [law-enforcement actors]{.mark} such as coast
guards and the role of paramilitary maritime militias are new phenomena.
This **[introduces a variable]{.mark}** that has **[not]{.mark} been
[seen previously]{.mark}**. A clash between coast guard or militia
vessels [may **escalate** to the **involvement of naval
vessels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, so far---despite substantial
clashes at sea between maritime law-enforcement actors---such escalation
has not occurred. 76

[A further issue arising from competing maritime claims in Asia is their
linkage with nationalism and history. [Contested claims over the
**sovereign control of islands**]{.mark} and operations in contested
waters have [provoke]{.mark}d [significant **public reaction**
in]{.mark} countries across the region, including [China]{.mark},
Vietnam, and the Philippines. [Clashes]{.mark} that occur at sea
increasingly are portrayed on social media, and while that might
constrain maritime actors from acting aggressively, it also could
[**stoke protests** to which governments might feel the need to
respond]{.mark}, [to **assuage**]{.mark} **their
[publics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Significant protests occurred in China
following Japan's nationalization of the Senkaku Islands and in Vietnam
following China's exploration activities near the Paracel Islands, but
these did not result in escalatory processes and the governments in
question eventually acted to quell public displays of dissatisfaction.
77 However, it should be acknowledged that [[even a **single**]{.mark}
**future [clash]{.mark}** at sea [may]{.mark} act as a [trigger]{.mark}
for **[nationalist sentiment]{.mark}**, [which]{.mark} could **[elevate
an incident]{.mark}** beyond its objective political or strategic value
[and result in **unforeseen escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As with the Cold War, tensions have produced some positive outcomes,
particularly in managing interactions at sea and reducing the risk of
miscalculation. The 2014 multinational Code for Unplanned Encounters at
Sea (CUES) agreement indicated a desire to manage interactions at sea.
Similarly, the 2016 agreement between China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on CUES and ongoing negotiations over a
code of conduct for the South China Sea should be seen as starting
points to mitigate further the potential for unintended escalation at
sea. 78

Given the concerns that the Soviet Union highlighted in the 1970s
regarding the escalatory potential of inexperienced officers, the rapid
expansion of Asian coast guards should be noted. The circumstances of
East Asia, where coast guards are taking the lead in enforcing maritime
claims, suggest a need for similar agreements within this context. Such
agreements should be tailored to the specific roles that coast guards
undertake. 79 As with naval agreements during the Cold War, for such
agreements to be successful it is vital that all sides perceive their
operational and political benefits.

Hotlines also are present in Northeast Asia, most notably between the
military services of South Korea and Japan and those of South Korea and
China. 80 There also are moves toward a working-level hotline between
China and ASEAN. Further, there is a South Korea--China coast guard
hotline, which soon could be replicated between China and the
Philippines. 81 However, hotlines are effective only when both sides
agree to use them. There is some evidence that in times of crisis China
has not used hotlines effectively. In January 2017, a fleet of Chinese
military aircraft entered the South Korean air-defense identification
zone. Reports suggest that the Chinese did not answer the hotline when
South Korean officials attempted to contact them to clarify the fleet's
intentions. Nevertheless, Japan and China also are in the process of
agreeing on a communication mechanism to de-escalate unintended
incidents in the East China Sea. 82

This analysis suggests that the fear that escalation will result from an
incident at sea is, by and large, overemphasized. Clashes in areas of
strategic tension or contested maritime boundaries are to be expected;
however, there is little evidence that such clashes lead to escalatory
cycles or sustained violence.

This absence of escalatory behavior can be attributed to several factors
that maritime strategic geography imposes. Historically, the strategic
or political benefits of escalation at sea rarely have outweighed the
potential costs. The bottom line is that what happens at sea rarely
materially affects populations on land, and therefore a costly war over
maritime issues is less likely to occur.

De-escalation after an incident is facilitated by the fact that the sea
cannot be controlled permanently, so the costs of withdrawal are
reduced, as such a move does not result automatically in the loss of
territory. Further, the size of the maritime environment, coupled with
the speed of clashes at sea, allows for easier de-escalation, as time is
needed to concentrate often-dispersed maritime forces. Organic
escalation therefore is less likely to occur, since political and
military elites would be required to commit expensive assets
intentionally to continue a clash. Equally, information gathering also
is hindered by the nature of operations at sea. Time often is required
to ascertain facts fully, and this gap allows for political and
strategic tensions to cool.

[**[It would be wrong to suggest that it is impossible for an outbreak
of sustained violence at sea in Asia to occur]{.mark}**. Decision makers
could choose to escalate following a clash at sea, or they might feel
they had no other option. Further, the **geostrategic situation** in
East Asia]{.underline}, where the stakes are not existential, [may
increase the risk of one side seeing a strategic or political **benefit
from escalating** such a clash deliberately]{.underline}. However, to
date, incidents at sea in the region have not resulted in substantial
escalation; instead, they have conformed to the patterns outlined in
this analysis.

**[Unknowns in the nuclear balance]{.underline}**

[There remains [**uncertainty** about **nuclear deterrence** dynamics
between the **US and China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The concept of 'entanglement' in this context refers to the **[overlap
of nuclear and conventional force structures and
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A range of analyses have highlighted
the [entanglement between China's conventional and nuclear force
structures]{.underline}.42 While analysts hold different views, it's
possible that entanglement in China's forces may reflect efficiency
measures and bureaucratic infighting more than a clear strategic
rationale, such as deterring attacks against Chinese conventional
forces.43 Whatever the cause, [the physical reality of entanglement
remains the same. [Key **new PLA weapons systems are
dual-use**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the DF-26 missile, and there
have apparently been growing efforts to integrate Rocket Force
formations into China's nascent, integrated theatre commands.44
[**[Inadvertent entanglement]{.mark}** of systems would [indicate
dangerous **complacency**]{.mark} by Chinese military planners, implying
that [**nuclear risks** aren't being taken]{.mark} sufficiently
[seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some assessments, including from the US Government,45 and open-source
satellite imagery46 indicate that [China's nuclear arsenal is now on a
substantial and accelerating **growth trajectory**, narrowing the gap
with the US arsenal]{.underline}, although it should be noted that
doubts have been raised about whether PLA corruption is degrading some
capabilities.47 Whatever the pace of the expansion in Chinese nuclear
forces, the command-and-control arrangements and operational employment
of China's deterrent demand close observation and analysis. For example,
what are China's launch policies? What positive and negative controls
are in place on different launch platforms? Western intelligence
agencies will already be focused on those questions, but reliable
assessments will be complicated by the opacity of the Chinese system.
[The [**lack of transparency** over Chinese **nuclear doctrine**]{.mark}
is exacerbated by Beijing eschewing participation in arms-control
negotiations and **restricting** channels of **military-to-military
dialogue**]{.underline}.

Many analysts have argued that China's nuclear doctrine may be
influenced by a sense of vulnerability to a US first strike. Those
analysts often point to the putative vulnerability of China's small
fleet of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), which it's in the process
of upgrading.48 [While China is also strengthening the airborne leg of
its nuclear triad, the weight of its nuclear strategic deterrent
currently rests on its **land-based missiles**]{.underline}.

[[In a war]{.mark} between China and the US, [a key question would be
how much **degradation** Beijing would be willing to **accept**
in]{.mark} its rocket forces with regional range, such as the **[DF-21
and]{.mark} DF-[26]{.mark}**.49 Those are [the **crux of
entanglement**]{.mark} in China's rocket forces]{.underline}. Given that
the intermediate-range missiles threaten US bases and warships in the
region, [[they would be **high-priority targets** for the US]{.mark} and
any allied forces in a war]{.underline}. [[Because of **warhead
ambiguity**, the US might]{.mark} unintentionally [destroy]{.mark}
Chinese [**nuclear-armed missiles**, which Beijing]{.mark} might
[interpret as a **significant threat to its**]{.mark} **overall
[deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

China's nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) arsenal, on
the other hand, is clearly distinguishable, at least for the time
being.50 Escalation may be avoided if Beijing remains confident that it
has adequate warning to launch a second strike using its ICBM force. But
that makes assumptions about Chinese perceptions and nuclear doctrine.
[If Beijing's **threshold** for escalation lies elsewhere, and we don't
know whether it does, there's cause for **grave
concern**]{.underline}.51

[[The **escalation risk**]{.mark} of targeting early-warning and
command-and-control systems, including satellites, [is
**significant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.52 [The problem of
**[entangleme]{.mark}nt** is also relevant in this context.
**[Space-based systems]{.mark}** will be critical at all stages of a
conflict, across hybrid, conventional and nuclear thresholds. Even if
space-based assets were able to be ring fenced for nuclear or
non-nuclear use, which is questionable, it's [unlikely that]{.mark} the
[targeting country could make]{.mark} that [**distinction confidently**
in wartime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Equally, [direct ascent 'kinetic' kill
[antisatellite capabilities produce **debris fields** that may]{.mark}
indiscriminately [destroy a wide array of **space-based
assets**]{.mark}, potentially [including those of nuclear powers that
weren't]{.mark} at that point **[parties to the conflict]{.mark}**.
[This **cocktail of variables has highly escalatory
implications**]{.mark}]{.underline}.53

Uncertainty over the targeting of early-warning and command-and-control
systems is particularly relevant to Australia, which hosts capabilities
that support US extended deterrence, including the Australian Defence
Satellite Communication Station.54

A militarised dispute in the Western Pacific

[[A]{.mark} crisis or [conflict could start between **China** and one of
the countries]{.mark} with which [it has a **sovereignty
dispute**]{.mark} in the Western Pacific, [such as **Japan**]{.mark},
[the **Philippines**]{.mark} or Vietnam]{.underline}. [[That could
**involve the US**]{.mark} if Washington intervenes to support China's
adversary (note that [it has **security treaties**]{.mark} **with Japan
and the Philippines**)]{.underline}.82

[China's expansion in the East and South China seas is about more than
just the disputed features. Some sovereignty claims engage **natural
resources** and **military access**]{.underline}, and China may be
attempting to create a so-called 'bastion' to defend its
ballistic-missile submarines.83 The occupation of islands and features
provides potential military advantages but also engages wider interests
in national influence and sovereignty.

Brendan Taylor's work provides a useful summary of the different risks
present in the East and South China seas. He argues that the East China
Sea and the China--Japan relationship are of greater concern than the
well-covered tensions in the South China Sea. That assessment reflects
domestic politics in China and Japan, clearer US commitments to Japanese
defence, and Japan's own capabilities.84

Were conflict to be initiated unintentionally, such as by an accident at
sea, then fighting may be limited, without strong pressure to escalate,
even if the US becomes involved. However, [[China might
**intentionally** use limited use of force against a **regional state**,
anticipating]{.mark} that its adversary will [**back down** due

Crisis scenarios

[There are **three key sources of potential crisis** in the Western
Pacific that could involve both the **US and China** in a conflict: the
**Korean Peninsula**; **Taiwan**; and a militarised **dispute between
China** and another claimant state in either the **South or the East
China Sea**]{.underline}. This is far from an exhaustive list, and other
flashpoints, such as the China--India border, bear noting.65

This threefold formulation bears resemblance to Canberra-based strategic
studies academic Brendan Taylor's The four flashpoints, which remains an
excellent primer on regional risks from a political perspective. I don't
discuss the details of East and South China Sea politics and
capabilities in any depth in this report. Taylor's work is also
instructive in referring to the late and well-known Australian scholar
Coral Bell's idea of a 'crisis slide',66 which is important because
those potential flashpoints are deeply interrelated. To paraphrase Coral
Bell, crises may well come not as discrete 'boulders' but instead as a
crumbling mountainside.67

Below, I outline these potential sources of crisis, then provide a
schematic list of the thresholds that might be involved in escalation.
Finally, I suggest some broad ways that Australian decision-makers might
consider contributing militarily to those scenarios, highlighting the
relevance of such responses to the trajectory of a given crisis.

The Korean Peninsula

[[A]{.mark} very serious [crisis centred on **North Korea** remains
a]{.mark} real [possibility]{.mark}. The drivers [could come from
**within**]{.mark} North Korea, [through **international tension**, or
some **combination**]{.mark} of both]{.underline}.

In 2015, Peter Varghese, while Secretary of the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, speculated that [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [might
**collapse**]{.mark} under the weight of its own economic gravity and
contemplated the future of the Korean Peninsula in terms of **when**,
rather than whether, **reunification** will occur]{.underline}.68 [[Even
if]{.mark} the North Korean regime [doesn't]{.mark} collapse, [there's
potential for a **succession crisis**]{.mark} within the regime, in
which the alignment and conduct of the military could be
crucial]{.underline}.69

Domestic instability in North Korea would pose a range of problems for
the international community. [The safety of **North Korean nuclear
weapons** would be a **pre-eminent concern**]{.underline}.70 [[A]{.mark}
large-scale **[humanitarian catastrophe]{.mark}**, which [could drive
**migrants** across the **Chinese border**]{.mark}, would be another
concern]{.underline}, and the regional and international community would
need to be mindful of Beijing's equities in how the crisis were handled.
[The [US, So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rean [and Chinese militaries
would]{.mark} probably need to [be involved in managing]{.mark} such
eventualities [and]{.mark} could potentially be [acting in **close
proximately**]{.mark} to each other [inside No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea
in the event of a regime collapse. In such situations, the [**potential
for misunderstanding** resulting in]{.mark} either [**accidental
escalation** or **pressure to pre-empt**]{.mark} could be very
real]{.underline}.

[[A crisis]{.mark} on the Korean Peninsula [could]{.mark} also [be more
**immediately international**]{.mark} rather than domestic. For
instance, the [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean regime [might
**miscalculate** the **tolerance** of a]{.mark} future [US
admin]{.mark}istration [for **nuclear brinksmanship**, or]{.mark} a
[US]{.mark} administration might **[miscalculate the regime's]{.mark}
own [thresholds]{.mark}**]{.underline}.71 [Some research suggests that
the North Korean regime consistently responds to US -- South Korea joint
military exercises as a serious security threat, not mere theatre,
providing a **regular basis for miscalculation**]{.underline}.72 And
there's [plentiful space for **accidents**]{.underline} with tragic
outcomes, including involving third countries. For instance, [[a]{.mark}
North Korean [**missile test** over Japan could **misfire** and hit a
populated area, **dramatically escalating
tensions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whatever its cause, [[a crisis]{.mark}
on the Korean Peninsula [would]{.mark} almost certainly [involve]{.mark}
both [the **US and China**]{.mark}. Any crisis or conflict could
[involve heavy fighting]{.mark}, potentially [including the use of
**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}, close to the Chinese border]{.underline}.
The need to avoid inadvertent or accidental escalation with China
because of allied actions on the peninsula would clearly be a
pre-eminent concern.

Uncertainty and the maritime domain

The first reason for concern is the nature of the Indo-Pacific, and
specially the Western Pacific. Most thinking on crisis stability and
deterrence has focused on the Cold War confrontation between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact along a European land border and the associated contours
of the US--USSR nuclear relationship. But [[the Indo-Pacific is]{.mark}
principally [a **maritime theatre**]{.mark}. [It's been argued
that]{.mark} the [maritime domain]{.mark} may be [**less prone**
to]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation and]{.mark} disastrous
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Ships are inherently mobile, and
when they withdraw from a confrontation that doesn't ipso facto
represent the ceding of ground, making a backdown more politically
palatable.26 Another example is submarine deployment, which is something
rarely publicly signalled and therefore withdrawable without loss of
face. In other words, a level of ambiguity about forces in the maritime
domain, or an ability to shift intent and narrative or maintain
deniability, may offer opportunities for maintaining stability.

But [those same **attributes** of the maritime domain could also be
interpreted as reasons for concern.]{.underline} To begin with,
**[[offence--defence distinguishability is very low at
sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**.27 For instance, the Washington Conference in
1921--22, which was an attempt by the major powers to limit the naval
arms race, struggled to define offensive capability. [The vertical
launching system (**[VLS]{.mark}**) [ubiquitous on **Western
warships**]{.mark} is a prime contemporary example of this
problem]{.underline}. [[An adversary doesn't know whether VLS cells
contain **anti-air missiles for self-defence**]{.mark}, [**land-attack
missiles** for long-range strike, or]{.mark} the
**[next-gen]{.mark}eration** stealthy [anti-ship missile]{.mark}
currently under development]{.underline} for the US military.
[**[Sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}** [and the contents of their magazines
pose a similar problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And some analysts have noted that ['modern [warships have **glass
jaws**]{.mark}']{.underline}---that is, [they're vulnerable, if not to
sinking, then to being [put out of action by]{.mark} even [a
**single**]{.mark} missile or torpedo [hit]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 [This
arguably leads to a dynamic in which 'whichever side completes the
targeting chain first and fires first almost **always wins**', and
[creates a **powerful incentive to pre-empt**]{.mark}]{.underline}.29 In
other words, ships that can be discovered are very vulnerable. [There
can, [therefore]{.mark}, be [a **major advantage in shooting
first**]{.mark}]{.underline} when conflict seems imminent. [This
suggests the potential for [maritime scenarios]{.mark} in which
[**escalation pressures** are **very strong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The longstanding [naval preoccupation with **presence** can]{.mark}
also [be read as]{.mark} the **[capacity to act with little
warning]{.mark}**, and sea power has specific characteristics that
[produce **uncertainty and ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.30

[Were conflict to be initiated unintentionally, such as by an accident
at sea, then fighting may be limited, without strong pressure to
escalate, even if the US becomes involved. However, China might
intentionally use limited use of force against a regional state,
anticipating that its adversary will back down due to real or perceived
risk aversion]{.underline}.85

The US response in such a scenario would depend on a range of factors,
including the extent to which the conflict started as a clear result of
Chinese aggression and US security obligations to China's adversary. [If
**[both sides]{.mark}** were [committed to **limiting conflict** to a
confined]{.mark} geographical [area, as was]{.mark} largely [the case
with the **exclusion zones** announced in the **1982 Falklands

wouldn't escalate]{.mark} even if the US became involved, **[but that

When Two Become One

[Two [potential **flashpoints** in the **Indo-Pacific** are
animating]{.mark} NATO's [focus]{.mark} on the region]{.underline}.
First, NATO members are concerned that if China uses force against
Taiwan and the United States comes to its direct defense, Washington
would have to make difficult trade-offs that would compel its NATO
allies to shoulder more of the burden in deterring Russia. In addition,
[[if deterrence in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [fails, the
**economic consequences**]{.mark} for Europe [would be
**devastating**]{.mark}. [Supply chains]{.mark} across Europe [would be
severely **disrupted**]{.mark}, with a [**conflict over Taiwan**
estimated to shave]{.mark} up to **[\$10 trillion off global
GDP]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Second, [[a conflict on the **Korean Peninsula** would bring about
similar dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Whereas it remains unknown
whether the United States would defend Taiwan, there is no doubt that it
would defend South Korea against North Korean aggression. Such a
contingency would likely draw U.S. forces from Europe and harm European
economies, with [a recent analysis estimating that a war on the Korean
Peninsula would **[reduce global GDP by \$4
trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Grid" https://www.cfr.org/report/cyberattack-us-power-grid Accessed
6.26.2025 // ***mosuQ***\]

Attacks on power grids are no longer a theoretical concern. In 2015, an
attacker took down parts of a power grid in Ukraine. Although
attribution was not definitive, geopolitical circumstances and forensic
evidence suggest Russian involvement. A year later, Russian hackers
targeted a transmission level substation, blacking out part of Kiev. In
2014, Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency,
testified before the U.S. Congress that [**[China]{.mark}** and a few
other countries likely [had the **capability** to **shut down** the U.S.
power grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. Iran, as an emergent cyber actor, could
acquire such capability. Rapid digitization combined with low levels of
investment in cybersecurity and a weak regulatory regime suggest that
the U.S. power system is as vulnerable---if not more vulnerable---to a
cyberattack as systems in other parts of the world.

[An adversary with the capability to **exploit vulnerabilities** within
the U.S. **power grid** [might be motivated]{.mark} to carry out such an
attack [under]{.mark} a variety of circumstances. An attack on the power
grid could be part of [a **coordinated military action**]{.mark},
intended as [a **signaling mechanism** during]{.mark} a [crisis, or as a
**punitive measure in response to U.S. actions in some other
arena**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In each case, the United States should
consider not only the potential damage and disruption caused by a
cyberattack but also its broader effects on U.S. actions at the time it
occurs. With respect to the former, a cyberattack could cause power
losses in large portions of the United States that could last days in
most places and up to several weeks in others. The economic costs would
be substantial. As for the latter concern, the U.S. response or
non-response could harm U.S. interests. Thus, the United States should
take measures to prevent a cyberattack on its power grid and mitigate
the potential harm should preventive efforts fail.

[FBI Director Christopher Wray on April 18 warned national security and
intelligence experts]{.underline}, as well as students, [that
[risks]{.mark} the government of [China poses to U.S.]{.mark} national
and economic security [are "upon us]{.mark} now"---and that [U.S.
**critical infrastructure** is a prime target]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"The PRC \[People's Republic of [China]{.underline}\] [has made it clear
that it considers **every sector** that makes our society run as fair
game in its bid to dominate on the world stage, and that [its plan is to
land]{.mark} low [blows against **civilian infrastructure**]{.mark} to
try to **induce panic** and break America's will to
resist]{.underline}," he said in remarks at the Vanderbilt Summit on
Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats in Nashville.

But he suggested that partnerships with both the private sector and
academia can be powerful tools in the quest to neutralize this threat.

Understanding the Threat

The overall threat from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a hybrid
one that involves crime, counterintelligence, and cybersecurity---and
which the FBI is countering with resources from all three missional
spheres, Wray said.

The threat is partially "driven by the CCP's aspirations to wealth and
power," Wray said, adding that China wants to "seize economic
development in the areas most critical to tomorrow's economy," even if
doing so requires theft. The Chinese government has tried to pilfer
"intellectual property, technology, and research" from nearly every
industry in the U.S. economy, he noted.

But [the CCP also wants [to **prevent** the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [from being able to **get in the way** of a]{.mark}
potential future "crisis between **China and [Taiwan by
2027]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} he said. Americans are starting to feel
the effects of this sprint, he said, pointing to "cyber intrusions and
criminal activity" as early deterrence efforts by the CCP.

Budgets currently being crafted will determine what resources the U.S.
government will have available to fight back three years from now. "In
the private sector and academia, too, the investments, partnerships,
security, and capabilities you're building today will dictate how those
sectors are prepared---or not---three short years from now," he added.

Protecting Critical Infrastructure

[The FBI worries what [this]{.mark} sprint [means]{.mark} for our
country\'s critical infrastructure, since "these vital
sectors---[everything from water treatment facilities and **energy
grids**]{.mark} to transportation and information technology---form the
backbone of our society."]{.underline}

["The fact is, [the PRC's targeting of our critical infrastructure
is]{.mark} both [broad and unrelenting]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said.
And, he added, [the immense size---and expanding nature---of the CCP's
hacking program isn't just aimed at stealing American intellectual
property. "It's using that mass, those numbers, to give itself the
ability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a
time of its choosing,"]{.underline} he said.

This risk isn't new, he said. [[CCP-sponsored cyber actors
**\"pre-positioned"** themselves to]{.mark} potentially [mount **cyber
offenses** against American energy companies]{.mark} in
2011]{.underline}---targeting 23 different pipeline operators.

Taiwan

[Taiwan is probably the most frequently cited potential **flashpoint**
between **China and the US**]{.underline}.74 [A range of triggers could
prompt a crisis in or around the Taiwan Strait, including a unilateral
declaration of independence from Taipei]{.underline} (fairly unlikely to
happen), [or a decision by **Beijing** to ratchet up **military**,
economic and political **pressure** (including interference) on, or even
[to **invade**]{.mark}, [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some
analysis of those possibilities has tended towards alarmism (given just
how difficult and costly an invasion of Taiwan would be),75 [war over
Taiwan remains a real possibility]{.underline}.

A direct attack against Taiwan would be a dramatically escalatory first
move from China. [Were [China]{.mark} seeking to invade and occupy
Taiwan, it [would]{.mark} need to [launch]{.mark} extensive and
overwhelming **[preliminary strikes]{.mark}** to facilitate access for
**amphibious transports** and major surface vessels]{.underline}. [[We
could expect **cyberattacks** on]{.mark} command-and-control
[**infrastructure** and]{.mark} potential [antisatellite attacks]{.mark}
(using either physical or cyber means). [Those attacks may **extend to
US systems**, or]{.mark} even to [**US forces** based in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}76

[The US might respond to a direct Chinese attack on Taiwan in several
ways. The US's resolve to oppose the invasion directly would be stronger
were US forces, systems or its homeland targeted, but it's possible that
the US might **intervene militarily** even if China directed its initial
campaign **only against Taiwan**]{.underline}. Historically, the US has
sought to maintain ambiguity about this calculation. Broadly speaking, a
direct US military response would involve US maritime forces manoeuvring
in the Western Pacific and striking Chinese capabilities, employing some
version of DMO. Such a direct US response has been critiqued as being,
in turn, highly escalatory because it's likely to be operationally
necessary for US strikes on Chinese capabilities (for example, on
mainland-based command-and-control architecture, missile launch sites
and so on) required to establish and maintain American freedom of
manoeuvre.77

BEIJING/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - [[China placed **export
restrictions** on **rare earth elements**]{.mark} on Friday [as part of
its]{.mark} sweeping [**response** to]{.mark} U.S. President Donald
[Trump\'s **tariffs**]{.mark}, squeezing supply to the West of minerals
used to make weapons, electronics and a range of consumer
goods]{.underline}.

[The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets
up trade tensions between the world\'s two largest economies and leaves
American manufacturers **scrambling** for fresh supplies of the critical
minerals they have **relied upon** for decades]{.underline}.

China produces around 90% of the world\'s rare earths, a group of 17
elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and
electronics industries. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has only
**one**]{.mark} rare earths [mine]{.mark} and **[most of its supply
comes from China]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Beijing announced the controls late on Friday as part of a broader
package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump\'s
decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54%.

The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets
and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts
said.

[[The move]{.underline}]{.mark}, which affects exports to all countries,
not just the U.S., [[is the **latest demonstration** of China\'s ability
to **weaponize its dominance**]{.mark} over the mining and processing of
the critical minerals]{.underline}.

Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium,
gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related
items, will be placed on an export control list as of April 4, according
to a Ministry of Commerce release.

Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab, Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab
and Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab are among the U.S. companies that use
Chinese rare earths in their supply chains.

\"China made that list strategically,\" said Mel Sanderson, a director
at American Rare Earths (ARR.AX), opens new tab, which is building a
Wyoming rare earths mine it hopes to open by 2029, and co-chair of the
Critical Minerals Institute trade group. \"[They picked the things that
are **crucial** for the **U.S. economy**]{.underline}.\"

While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can
throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it
issues.

China\'s move will create \"a scramble for access to the limited sources
of alternative supply -- namely in Japan and South Korea,\" said Ryan
Castilloux, founder of consultancy Adamas Intelligence.

\'WILLING TO ESCALATE\'

Two industry sources said Chinese export restrictions on some rare
earths are a concern for some U.S. aerospace manufacturers because they
are sole-sourced from China for use in avionics.

RTX (RTX.N), opens new tab and Honeywell (HON.O), opens new tab declined
to comment. Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and GE (GE.N), opens new tab
did not respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough
to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity.

Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals
to the U.S. and slapped export controls on many others.

The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important because
China has even tighter control over these elements, said David Merriman
at consultancy Project Blue.

[\"[There is currently only **one**]{.mark} HREE (heavy rare earth
element) [focused operation **outside of China**]{.mark}, Myanmar and
Laos,\"]{.underline} he said, adding that [China has close involvement
in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos]{.underline}.

#### Turns case\-\--China [owns]{.underline} the [supply]{.underline} [chain]{.underline} and [processing]{.underline}. The US can't decouple [fast]{.underline} [enough]{.underline}. Even if we mine in the Arctic, China can restrict processing.

[When President Donald Trump launched a **trade war**, China hit back by
imposing **export restrictions** on seven heavy **rare earth**
elements]{.underline} vital for manufacturing advanced semiconductors
and other key technologies, particularly for aerospace and defense.

[[China's ability to **shut down** the]{.mark} heavy [rare earth]{.mark}
element [**supply chain** demonstrates the difficulty of decoupling. The
**US cannot find domestic substitutes**]{.mark}, at least [in the
**short term**]{.mark}. And it must compete with China to find
**alternative suppliers**]{.underline}, most of whom are located in the
Global South.

[China dominates the heavy rare earth element **supply
chain**]{.underline}. The world's richest deposits are located in
Jiangxi Province. [Until 2023, [China **produced 99%** of global heavy
rare earth elements]{.mark}, and it still produces 90% of the global
rare earth magnets]{.underline} (a critical input in defense
manufacturing). At the same time, [rare earths [comprise a **small**
share of China's total exports, allowing Beijing to sustain **minimal
economic damage**]{.mark} -- while causing a giant pain for the
US]{.underline}.

[[The US has **no**]{.mark} heavy rare earth
**[refining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In its 2024 National Defense
Industrial Strategy, the Department of Defense set a target to establish
a fully integrated mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain capable of
meeting American defense requirements by 2027. It has invested more than
\$439 million over the past five years, awarding almost \$45 million to
MP Materials, which owns the only rare earths mine in the US, the
Mountain Pass mine in California. Ironically, China's Shenghe Resources
owns 7.7% of the Mountain Pass Mine, underscoring just how deep China
has drilled down into critical minerals.

Under President Joseph Biden, the US championed several initiatives to
counter China's critical mineral dominance. It launched the Partnership
for Global Infrastructure and Investment in June 2022, which aimed to
invest \$600 billion in infrastructure projects. One of its landmark
projects, the Lobito Corridor, connecting Angola, Zambia, and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, facilitates the transport of critical
minerals to the US and Europe. The Minerals Security Partnership is
another G7 initiative that aims to fund strategic minerals projects
jointly with India, South Korea, and Estonia, among others. These
initiatives depend on pooled funding and aligning differing interests.

So far, [US investments are **far less than required to
de-risk**]{.underline}. According to the International Energy Agency,
the cost of mineral investment required for the energy sector alone
ranges from \$590 billion to more than \$2 trillion by 2040. [The US is
unlikely to be able to shoulder such exorbitant costs. Pouring huge sums
into far-flung mines might not be the wisest approach,
either]{.underline}.

An alternative strategy would be to encourage and incentivize investment
in mineral-rich countries. Here, too, US companies are at a
disadvantage. China takes a strictly business approach to investment,
ignoring human rights and corruption concerns. American companies, on
the other hand, need to abide by prohibitions around investing in
authoritarian or democratically challenged countries.

[[China has a **tolerance** for high-risk
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since 2005, the country has poured more
than \$391 billion into troubled loans that may never be paid back.
While this could be seen as a miscalculation in investment
decision-making, [it has [allow]{.mark}ed [the country to gain a
**foothold in new markets** and build]{.mark} the
[infrastructure]{.mark} and networks needed [to dominate **future**
supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}.

of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have concluded that

Russia has provided a vital lifeline to its defense industrial base,
while North Korea's shipment of munitions and ballistic missiles has
helped Russia replenish its weapons stocks. Countries in the
Indo-Pacific are thus enabling Russia to prosecute the largest war in
Europe since World War II.

[These dynamics will, in turn, affect Indo-Pacific security. In exchange
for the support it has received, [Russia will]{.mark} likely
[provide]{.mark} technical [assistance to]{.mark} **North Korea's

[If a **[war]{.mark}** breaks out [in the

primacy in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By mobilizing its
immense industrial base, [China has built [a]{.mark} substantial
[maritime fighting force]{.mark}---[now the **largest in the
world**]{.mark} by some measures, with **[more warships]{.mark} (370)
[than the entire U.S. Navy]{.mark} (296)**. And China's navy is [focused
on]{.mark} largely just [**one region**, while the **U.S.**]{.mark}
**Navy [is stretched]{.mark}** [across the globe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[China's military continues to grow at breakneck production rates that
the United States and its combined regional allies have yet to
match]{.underline}. Indeed, according to the U.S. Office of Naval
Intelligence, [[China]{.mark} now [possesses more than **two hundred
times** the shipbuilding **capacity** of the]{.mark} United
[States.]{.mark} Its **air force** and strategic **nuclear forces** have
also **surged**. Its missile capabilities are worrisome, as is its
determination to build out its nuclear arsenal, with the goal of
fielding more than **1,500 warheads by the mid-2030s**]{.underline}.

The U.S. maintains a significant qualitative advantage in a number of
critical areas. For example, the CFR delegation spent a day out at sea
on a nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine. And there seemed to be a
consensus---from the sailors on board to the admirals back in
headquarters---that [U.S. superiority undersea gives the United States a
significant **edge** in any potential conflict]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} the delegation heard repeatedly that
[**[scale]{.mark}**, and the military axiom that "**quantity** has a
quality all to its own," [is the **crux** of China's strategy to achieve
**military supremacy**]{.mark} **in the Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}. And
[on that score, [the **United States is lagging far
behind**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Concurrent with this military buildup, China has ratcheted up pressure
on long-time U.S. allies and partners in the region by militarizing
contested territories in the South and East China Seas and increasing
its long-time pressure campaign on Taiwan. These actions include China's
recent attempts to create facts on the ground to claim the Philippines'
Second Thomas Shoal and its move last week to plant a flag on Sandy Cay,
which the Philippines also claims.

On the issue of Taiwan, China has begun to ramp up large, live-fire
military drills in close proximity to the island, akin to dress
rehearsals for blockades, missile strikes, air raids, amphibious
assaults, and other offensive military operations. It has also severed a
number of critical undersea cables connected to Taiwan's outlying
islands and probed Taiwan's defenses with a steady stream of incursions
into air and water around Taiwan. Admiral Samuel J. Paparo, commander of
INDOPACOM, told the Senate Committee on Armed Services last month that
China's People's Liberation Army increased its military pressure against
Taiwan by 300 percent in 2024. In recent months, China has also debuted
its formidable amphibious assault capabilities, including massive
floating bridges and amphibious assault craft, which it could utilize in
a Taiwan invasion scenario.

The United States has watched as Beijing mobilized capital and
manipulated its investment policy, even as China's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth has slowed, in pursuit of its long-term economic
and security goals. Needless to say, [[**Beijing's scale advantage**
may]{.mark} prove to [be the **decisive factor** in]{.mark} determining
[the **balance of power** in the Indo-Pacific and
**beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Taipei, April 5 (CNA) [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\' [recent
**military activities** in the **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} region [are
aimed at **deterring China**]{.mark}, two analysts from a Taiwanese
military-backed think tank told CNA]{.underline}.

[The U.S. military exercises in the Indo-Pacific in recent years are
clearly directed at China, said Shu Hsiao-huang (舒孝煌), an associate
research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security
Research (INDSR), a Taipei-based think tank supported by Taiwan\'s
Ministry of National Defense]{.underline}.

The U.S. has developed new military operational concepts in response to
China\'s military expansion and potential military actions in the
Indo-Pacific, such as the Marine\'s Expeditionary Advanced Base
Operations (EABO), he said.

According to the Marine Corps website, [the EABO involves the
[employment of naval]{.mark} expeditionary [forces]{.mark} from a series
of locations ashore or inshore [within a]{.mark} **contested or
[potentially contested maritime area]{.mark}** in order [to conduct
**sea denial**, support **sea control**, or enable **fleet
sustainment**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Shu said that [in addition to the U.S. forces stationed in Japan, its
[deployments in South Korea have also seen a **\"shift\" of focus with
the aim of countering China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

These developments show that the [[U.S. strategic deployment is
concentrated on **responding** to]{.mark} \"potential threats from
China\" and potential People\'s Liberation Army\'s [actions in the
**Taiwan Strait**]{.mark}, [and the **East and South China
seas**]{.mark}]{.underline}, he added.

Shu made the comments [shortly after **[U.S. Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth]{.mark}** stressed the Pentagon\'s efforts to \"**reestablish
deterrence**\" in the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline} while
strengthening its cooperation with allies, during his visits to Japan
and the Philippines last week.

At the same time, the Washington Post reported at the end of March that
[a secret interim internal guidance memo signed by Hegseth had [called
for the U.S. military to **prioritize deterring a Chinese
takeover**]{.mark} **of Taiwan**]{.underline}.

Speaking with CNA, Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), director of INDSR\'s division of
defense strategy and resources, said U.S. President Donald Trump has
placed much less emphasis on Europe after returning to office in January
and concentrated American resources in the Indo-Pacific region.

[[The U.S. military is]{.mark} \"[**preparing** for]{.mark} potential

Taiwan must also strengthen its own defense capabilities to \"offset\"

[[The US will **remain focused** on containing China in the
**Indo-Pacific**, despite **short-term deployment distractions**]{.mark}
caused by its direct involvement [in the **Israel-Iran**
conflict]{.mark}, according to analysts.]{.underline}

US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the American
military had "totally obliterated" three of Iran's nuclear sites, making
Washington a direct participant in Israel's conflict with its long-time
regional rival.

[Before the strikes, the United States had repositioned forces for the
conflict, including shifting assets away from the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.

Last week, the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz cancelled a planned port call
in Vietnam to support the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group in the
Middle East.

The redeployment of the Nimitz is the fourth of its kind in the past
year, prompting caution from Taiwan, which relies heavily on the US
military presence in the region to deter the People's Liberation Army.

Observers said that [while the decision to strike Iran expanded US
military engagement in Middle Eastern warfare, **[Washington]{.mark} had
[pledged repeatedly]{.mark}** [to keep the **main focus** of strategic
resources on **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Hu Bo, director of the Centre for Maritime Strategy Studies at Peking
University, said that while the US had shifted substantial naval and air
forces to [the Middle East]{.mark}, it did [not signal a **long-term
strategic change**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"About 50 per cent of the US' deployable overseas naval and air forces
have been concentrated in the area of responsibility of Central Command
and the adjacent European Command, which has indirectly affected
deployments in the Indo-Pacific," Hu said.

"[US forces in the Indo-Pacific are currently under-resourced, but
whether that situation continues depends on **how long** the war in the
Middle East lasts]{.underline}," he added. "[In the long run, the
Indo-Pacific will remain Washington's primary strategic
focus]{.underline}."

The strikes on Iran targeted key nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan,
and Natanz, centres critical to Iran's nuclear programme. The escalation
followed Israel's airstrikes on Iran on June 13, with Tehran responding
with its own strikes on Israel.

In a televised address from the White House, Trump described the strikes
as a "spectacular military success", warning of further action "if peace
does not come quickly".

Diao Daming, a professor at Renmin University's school of international
studies, said the strikes on Iran highlighted Israel's sway over the
Trump administration's Middle East policy.

"\[It also\] reinforces the clear pro-Israel stance seen during Trump's
first term, which has continued into his second," he said, adding that
the US' long-term focus was still on China.

Diao said the US started pivoting from the Middle East to the
Indo-Pacific during the administration of former president Barack Obama,
while formal strategic competition with China started during Trump's
first term.

"[[This shift represents a **long-term, directional change in US
fo**]{.mark}**reign [po]{.mark}licy**. Given that, [it's hard to view a
**single military operation** as a reversal]{.mark} of that broader
strategic adjustment]{.underline}," he added.

Although it was not clear what effect the direct US involvement would
have on the scale and length of the Israel-Iran conflict, Chinese
analysts said [[a **prolonged war**]{.mark} was
**[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the US
strikes, warning on social media that they would have "everlasting
consequences" and Iran "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty,
interests, and people".

[Nanjing university professor Zhu Feng]{.underline} said the US launched
the strikes on the assumption that Iran's capacity for retaliation was
limited due to severe economic and social instability.

"[The [US' **selective intervention does not amount to full-scale
involvement**]{.mark}. I don't believe this will **delay or weaken**
Washington's strategic pressure on China]{.underline}," Zhu said.

[Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin
University, echoed that view]{.underline}.

"[[The distraction posed by the Middle East]{.mark} war [to]{.mark} US
[attention on the Indo-Pacific is **nearing its
end**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Shi said.

"If Iran's underground uranium enrichment facilities are confirmed to
have been destroyed, then Israel has achieved its primary war objective.

"[With Iran's **air defence systems dismantled** and its ballistic
missile and long-range drone capabilities severely **diminished**, it is
now largely **incapable** of conducting effective offensive or defensive
operations]{.underline}."

[[The]{.mark} North American [**Arctic** is emerging as a **key
strategic space**]{.mark} for the United States and its Allies and
Partners. [Protecting the focal point could determine the outcome of any
potential conflict in the **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia seek to contain and
isolate the U.S. to prevent it from projecting power abroad.

The North American Arctic is a focus for geopolitical competition, with
the PRC and Russia asserting their interests in the region. The PRC,
although not an Arctic nation, is investing in capabilities to exploit
the region for strategic purposes and seeks to participate in its
governance and economy.

The Arctic focus is heightened by a steady melting of the polar ice cap,
enhancing shipping access to the resource-rich and strategically
critical region that once was largely ignored, hidden beneath frozen
terrain. Arctic temperatures are rising as much as four times faster
than the global average, studies show.

As part of its One Belt, One Road infrastructure scheme, the PRC is
expanding naval operations in an attempt to secure sea lanes for a
growing shipping industry, leveraging dual-use military and research
vessels to increase Chinese Communist Party military engagement and
Arctic domain awareness. Growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia,
as evidenced by recent combined maritime and bomber patrols, could
undermine Arctic stability, potentially leading to misunderstandings and
miscalculations.

[[The]{.mark} North American [Arctic holds **critical defense
infrastructure**]{.mark} for the U.S. and its Allies and Partners,
[including **long-range radars** essential to domain awareness and
**Indo-Pacific capabilities**]{.mark} positioned in Alaska. [Should a
**regional conflict** expand into the Arctic, the U.S. could
face]{.mark} domain awareness **[disruption]{.mark}** across Alaska, and
disruption of power projection infrastructure [that could **compromise
deployment** of advanced capabilities to the **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}
and other theaters]{.underline}.

Such scenarios are driving a resurgence of the U.S. Department of
Defense's (DOD) focus on the North American Arctic. As outlined in the
DOD's 2024 Arctic Strategy, U.S. Special Operations Forces (USSOF) are
critical to advancing capabilities and mitigating threats to defense
infrastructure.

U.S. Special Operations Command North (SOCNORTH) plans and executes
USSOF missions in North America. SOCNORTH focuses on identifying malign
activity, contesting global chokepoints, enhancing all-domain awareness
and enabling integrated deterrence in cooperation with U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command and other combatant and special operations commands.

To address growing concerns in the Arctic, SOCNORTH recently executed
two phases of Operation Polar Dagger, an operational series that
demonstrates rapidly deployable, joint SOF capabilities throughout the
North American Arctic. It forms the basis of options to deter, disrupt
and deny adversary activity in support of U.S. Northern Command's
(USNORTHCOM) layered defense of the U.S. homeland.

More than 200 USSOF and conventional forces deployed across the North
American Arctic in mid-2024 to operate in the maritime, air and land
domains. The operations enhance USNORTHCOM's deterrence posture and
domain awareness, while also validating USSOF proficiency in cold
weather and austere environments.

In 2023 and 2024, SOCNORTH and the U.S. Navy partnered to deploy the
amphibious transport dock ship USS John P. Murtha and the USS John L.
Canley, an expeditionary sea base vessel that supports SOF operations
and other maritime missions, to the Bering Sea and the Arctic Circle to
support Operation Polar Dagger. USSOF is enhancing its navigation
expertise in Arctic terrain and has demonstrated the ability to thrive
in the region by executing long-range movements, maritime interdiction
operations, rapid infiltration/exfiltration, air-to-ground integration,
critical infrastructure defense, domain awareness, and medical
evacuation validation, among other engagements.

As home to capabilities such as aerospace and maritime control and
warning systems, as well as strategically significant maritime
chokepoints, [the North American Arctic is vital to homeland defense,
according to the DOD's 2024 strategy. [The region]{.mark} also [is
**integral**]{.mark} to Indo-Pacific operations as the northern flank
for force projection from the U.S. homeland]{.underline}.

Through operations such as Polar Dagger, SOCNORTH iteratively evaluates
and integrates capabilities that underpin homeland defense and enable
forward operations. [[With highly proficient]{.mark} multidomain SOF and
conventional forces conducting [operations in the]{.mark} North American
[Arctic, the U.S. can deploy at-will capabilities to **operate
effectively**]{.mark} in the Arctic [while **securing**]{.mark} U.S.

President Donald [[Trump made the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a
direct party to the **Iran-Israel** conflict through]{.mark} a series of
[**strikes** on **Iranian nuclear facilities**]{.mark} on June
21]{.underline}. [[That decision has forced the Asia policy
community]{.mark} on both sides of the Pacific [to ask whether]{.mark}
the [Trump]{.mark} administration [is]{.mark} truly [**committed**
to]{.mark} an **["Asia First" approach]{.mark}** to U.S. national
security strategy]{.underline}. The U.S. is deepening its engagement in
the over 16-month-long Middle East conflict even as Trump is straining
its network of allies and partners over trade and pressuring its
Indo-Pacific allies on defense spending. [[This **backsliding on
prioritizing the Indo-Pacific theater** is compounded by **cuts to
foreign assistance offices**]{.mark}, U.S. information and media
programs, [and **key China staff at the N**]{.mark}ational
**[S]{.mark}**ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline}.

[U.S. policy in the Middle East has impacted Washington's alliance
**management in the Indo-Pacific and beyond**]{.underline}. Japan's
Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru's decision to skip the NATO Summit can be
read as linked to the escalation in Iran. This, along with reports that
Tokyo is rescheduling July 2+2 talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth over the Trump
administration's mixed messaging on Japan's defense spending, suggests
that Trump's call sheet should include leaders well beyond the Middle
East and Europe.

What happens in the Middle East has historically yielded global ripple
effects, from oil shocks and mass migration to spikes in terrorist
attacks. U.S. allies Japan, Australia, and South Korea and burgeoning
partner India -- to say nothing about China -- will be directly impacted
by any strain on oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) exports caused by a
prolonged conflict. More broadly, [it is well recognized by both sides
of the political aisle -- albeit ignored by policymakers in successive
U.S. administrations -- that U.S. [**overextension** in the **Middle
East** comes at the **expense** of focusing on the **Indo-Pacific and
China**]{.mark}, by [siphon]{.mark}ing [away **finite**]{.mark}
**military and political [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What is less discussed is how U.S. resolve and credibility, often on
display in the Middle East as the predominant theater of U.S. military
action -- be it in Iran, Gaza, Syria, or Libya -- impacts
decision-making, defense planning, and political alignment among U.S.
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. Years ago, colleagues in Japan
shared with me how they had interpreted then-President Barack Obama's
2013 "red-line" moment in Syria, where the U.S. did not respond
militarily to the former Bashar al-Assad regime's chemical weapons
massacre. The decision was justified as the U.S. not wanting to repeat
the mistakes of Iraq, but this perceived weakness, which ultimately gave
Russia a stronger strategic foothold in the Middle East, gave foreign
policy thinkers and decision-makers pause in East Asia.

During the Biden administration, when I worked as a China adviser at the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), we heard from
colleagues in Muslim-majority Southeast Asian countries that Israel's
U.S.-backed campaign in Gaza made it difficult to robustly champion U.S.
diplomatic and development initiatives in their countries and region.

U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific should observe that the Trump
administration's strategic approach to foreign policy is a moving
target. Future bilateral and multilateral forums present opportunities
to remind Trump and his Cabinet of the priority theater. The first 100
days of the second Trump administration appeared to yield a distinct
"Commerce Not Chaos" approach in regions like the Middle East --
welcomed by Arab Gulf allies who have been bidding for Trump's favor. At
the time, it appeared that the U.S. would cut its losses in campaigns
like the Red Sea, deprioritize human rights international development
assistance, and focus on shifting resources to priority theaters.

Likewise, the new administration's early diplomacy on Ukraine, which
adopted Russian President Vladimir Putin's framing of the conflict and
centered on a Ukrainian critical minerals deal, suggested that Trump
would be ruthlessly committed to ending conflicts and maximizing the
United States' returns. But Russia's onslaught in Ukraine and Israel's
devastating operations in Gaza have continued, and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appeared to pull Trump into the
Israel-Iran war. Trump's "peace through strength" moniker appears to be
less of a doctrine and more of a cover for the lack of disciplined

the hope that Trump's "peace through strength" approach to Iran yields a
diplomatic nuclear agreement that is more acceptable to the U.S. and the
region, which have been menaced by Iran's foreign policy for decades. A

[[The **DoD Arctic Strategy** frames the Arctic as a region]{.mark} from
and [through **power**]{.mark} (in this case, primarily in the form of
kinetic threats) [is **projected** into the international
system]{.mark}]{.underline}.52 Power projection from the Arctic is often
associated with the Kola Peninsula, and Russian long-range fires
originating from there. For example, the strategy notes that "Russia's
Arctic capabilities have the potential to hold the U.S. homeland, as
well as Allied and partner territory, at risk." 53 This is well
established in defence thinking going back to the start of the Cold
War.54 However, the strategy makes clear that [the Arctic is a place
from and through which [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
increasingly **projecting military force** from Alaska into the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}]{.underline}.55 [Similarly, the strategy
highlights that being able to **operate** in the Arctic demonstrates
credibility not only in defence but in "global power projection
operations."]{.underline}56

This sets up the relationship between threats to and from the Arctic
from an American vantage point. [The DoD Arctic Strategy notes that
"**[Russia]{.mark}**... [could]{.mark} use its Arctic-based capabilities
to [**threaten the ability** of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to
**project power**]{.mark} both [to **Europe** and the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} **region**, [constraining our **ability to
respond to crises**]{.mark}."]{.underline}57 Part of this ability to
constrain American power projection stems from threatening American
forces and infrastructure in the North American and European Arctics.
[These [forces might be **in** the Arctic but are **primarily oriented**
around]{.mark} effecting [international security and]{.mark} defence
objectives, like achieving **integrated
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This demonstrates the utility of the
DoD's Arctic Strategy approaching the Arctic from the outside
perspective of the international level of analysis, rather than a
regional or state-centric lens.

President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} has [initiated a sweeping
**downsizing** of the]{.mark} White House\'s **[National Security
Council]{.mark}** (NSC), dismissing dozens of staff members, placing
others on administrative leave, and instructing many detailees to return
to their home agencies]{.underline}.

Newsweek reached out to the White House, NSC and State Department
outside of normal business hours on Friday evening by email for comment.

Why It Matters

The NSC has undergone a number of changes over the past month, starting
with the removal of Mike Waltz as head of the agency following the
Signal chat group scandal. Trump has instead nominated Waltz as the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, while assigning Secretary of State
Marco Rubio to serve as acting adviser.

[The administration then [placed]{.mark} around [**160 aides**
on]{.mark} administrative [leave]{.mark} while officials reviewed
staffing to best meet Trump\'s goal of **downsizing** the size and scope
of the federal government]{.underline}.

Far-right media personality Laura Loomer has been tied to Trump\'s
decision to fire Waltz and other aides, although the president has
denied that she was the reason for the firings.

What To Know

Trump has initiated a significant overhaul of the NSC that will
ultimately cut it down and return a many career appointees back to the
home agencies - a move that some have described as a \"liquidation\" due
to the severity of cuts being implemented.

The FT reports that the restructuring was described by one insider as a
\"liquidation. The news outlet said that Ivan [Kanapathy, [the
NSC\'s]{.mark} senior director for **Asia**, remains in his role, though
his **[China-focused team has been let go]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Along with the Financial Times, CNN and Axios have also confirmed the
NSC shake-up, which comes three weeks after Trump removed his first
national security adviser, Mike Waltz.

NSC Chief of Staff Brian McCormack informed members of the NSC that they
had 30 minutes to remove their belongings and exit the building, which
is located next to the White House.

Dennis Wilder, a former top NSC official in George W. Bush\'s
administration, told the FT there was \"no question that the NSC in the
Biden administration had become bloated and was high-handedly trying to
implement foreign policy rather than doing its traditional role of
co-ordinating the implementation by the rest of the national security
establishment.\"

What Happens Next

[[The NSC will continue to operate at a **reduced capacity**]{.mark},
and it is unclear how the cuts impact its ability [to **perform its
duties**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[For more than a decade, the U.S. has dangled the prospect of a dramatic
**policy shift to Asia**, only to fall short of this
promise]{.underline} --- and President Donald Trump's administration may
not be an exception to what is now becoming more of a rule than an
aberration.

[[Trump's decision to unleash]{.mark} the awesome power of the U.S.
[military on]{.mark} three key **[Iranian nuclear sites]{.mark}** over
the weekend, followed by Trump's surprise announcement days later of a
ceasefire between Iran and Israel, [has raised the stakes for Asian
nations]{.mark}, which are watching with great interest how the Middle
East conflict unfolds.]{.underline}

[[A **drawn-out conflict** could once again see the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **[ensnared]{.mark}** in the region. But the nature of
the U.S. strikes --- which observers have framed as "perhaps the most
consequential decision of Trump's second-term presidency" --- could mean
even a quick de-escalation of hostilities will have lasting
ramifications that will **impact Asia**.]{.underline}

[In general, the U.S. military strikes on Iran "are [a **bad sign** for
maintaining Washington's **focus** on the **Indo-Pacific** as the
'priority theater']{.mark} into the future,"]{.underline} said Derek
Grossman, a professor of international relations at the University of
Southern California (USC).

For now, much hinges on whether Trump's Monday announcement of a
ceasefire holds --- and more importantly, whether this can be translated
into something more durable.

"The degree to which Iran takes the U.S. away from a focus on the
Indo-Pacific depends very much on how entangled the U.S. becomes and for
how long," said David Wroe, a resident senior fellow at the Australian
Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).

While [some observers have warned of the U.S. becoming once again mired
in another **open-ended Middle East conflict**]{.underline}, Wroe said a
key difference with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is that there is
little chance the U.S. would send troops into Iran.

"If the U.S. can contain Iranian retaliation \... then it can resume its
focus on the Indo-Pacific," he said. "But it will require some very deft
diplomacy with a desperate Iranian regime to limit the fallout to a
brief round of exchanges, which is a big ask."

Tokyo unnerved

While the Japanese government has welcomed the ceasefire proposal and
appeared to show some support for the U.S. strikes, saying that it
"understands" the need to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons,
the conflict has unnerved Tokyo.

"Japan believes that it is of the utmost importance to de-escalate the
situation as soon as possible," the government's top spokesman, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, told a regular news conference
Tuesday. "We are deeply concerned about a cycle of retaliation and
continue to strongly hope that dialogue will resume."

The conflict has already played at least some part in Prime Minister
Shigeru Ishiba's abrupt decision Monday to cancel his trip to a key NATO
leaders' summit this week. It also comes as Japan is preoccupied with
stalled negotiations over Trump's tariffs and growing unease about calls
from Washington for Tokyo to plow more cash into its defense.

"Japan and other allies will no doubt be nervous about the U.S. becoming
again embroiled in the Middle East," said Wroe. "But \... the fact that
he has shown he is prepared to use American military power judiciously
to resolve a global danger should give them some encouragement."

Going forward, the devil will be in the details as more information
about both the ceasefire and an assessment of the U.S. attack on the
Iranian nuclear sites emerge.

For Tokyo, an "optimistic scenario" might be that the American
airstrikes successfully disabled or delayed Iran\'s nuclear development
and that any retaliation by Tehran remains limited, allowing peace talks
to start, said Masashi Murano, a Japan expert at the Hudson Institute
think tank.

"If that happens, the attack would send a deterrent signal to other
countries that the second Trump administration is not reluctant to take
military action, while also making it easier to shift the strategic
focus to the Indo-Pacific region by avoiding further entanglement in the
Middle East," according to Murano.

[[A]{.mark} "pessimistic" [scenario]{.mark}, however, [would see the
airstrikes **failing** to effectively halt Iran's nuclear
ambitions]{.mark}, potentially **[requiring further U.S.
attacks]{.mark}** and prompting reprisals from Tehran, [as a]{.mark}
spiraling or [**drawn-out** conflict confounds
Washington]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[As a result, just as past administrations have repeatedly attempted
and failed to do, [the **'pivot' to the Indo-Pacific will be
delayed**]{.mark} once again]{.underline}, potentially increasing the
likelihood of opportunistic aggression in the region or undermining the
U.S. military\'s capabilities to respond effectively if such aggression
occurs," Murano said.

Chinese opportunism?

A looming concern of Japan and other U.S. allies and partners in the
Indo-Pacific is the potential for China to take advantage of any shift
in American focus.

The Foreign Ministry in Beijing has strongly condemned the U.S.
bombings, saying that the actions "seriously violate the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and international law, and have
exacerbated tensions in the Middle East."

But the concerns America's Asian partners have of Chinese opportunism
amid the crisis --- including any move against democratic Taiwan --- may
be unfounded.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its own and has vowed to unify the self-ruled
island with the mainland, by force if necessary. In recent years,
China's increasingly powerful military has ramped up activities around
Taiwan, including in waters and airspace near Japan.

"It's one thing to carry out airstrikes against a nation that has
already been significantly degraded by a neighbor --- in this case
Israel --- but it's another to commit to fighting a war with China,"
ASPI's Wroe said. "At best, this has a mild deterrent effect against any
move by Beijing against Taiwan."

Still, Trump delivered another, more implicit message in his decision to
strike the Iranian nuclear sites, according to former Trump
administration official Fred Fleitz.

"The strikes are going to show American strength," Fleitz, who is
currently an expert with the America First Policy Institute think tank,
told The Japan Times during a visit to Tokyo on Monday. "When other
states look at this, they\'re going to see a president who\'s decisive,
who stands by what he says and is prepared to use military force when
necessary."

The ASPI's Wroe, meanwhile, said Beijing would be expected to view the
moves "as an indication that Trump will use force when he sees a
reasonable calculation that the rewards outweigh the risks."

"They'll be watching closely the mettle he shows in the coming days and
weeks," he added.

For now, the United States' partners in Asia will have to wait and see
how Trump's peace entreaties play out. Will the U.S. fixation on the
Middle East continue? That remains an open question.

"[The reality is that \... [the U.S. has become]{.mark} increasingly
**[preoccupied]{.mark}** with events in the Middle East]{.underline},"
said USC's Grossman. "[Washington now [runs the risk of once again
getting **bogged down**]{.mark} in this region, [at the expense of the

On the surface, given the publicity that clashes at sea garner, such a
fear may seem well-founded. 4 Numerous studies have revealed the
propensity for conflict escalation over the issue of sovereign control
of land, including disputed islands. 5 However, the potential for
escalation arising from incidents at sea and the strategic effect of
such incidents remain largely understudied phenomena. 6 [By focusing
solely on [incidents at **sea**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this article
argues that in areas of contested maritime jurisdictional claims or
maritime zones in which strategic competitors meet, peaceful
interactions among military, law-enforcement, and civilian actors should
not be expected. However, [accidental, inadvertent, or even intentional
acts that result in clashes between rival forces should [**not trigger
sustained escalatory cycles** or be]{.mark} construed as [a **prelude to
major conflict**]{.mark} at sea or on land]{.underline}. Rather, such
events should be viewed as an expected consequence of operations in
contested maritime environments. In short, [at sea, [the threshold for
**stability**]{.mark} in contested areas [is
**low**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and therefore escalatory incidents are
likely; however, [escalatory cycles or sustained conflict, including war
at sea, are **unlikely** to follow such incidents]{.underline}.

To justify this contention, this article argues that a [maritime
strategic environment imposes specific conditions on escalatory and
triggering dynamics. Disputed maritime borders, unlike those on land,
cannot be held, and thus must be contested. Despite this requirement of
contestation and the impossibility of exercising total control,
[conflicts at sea typically do not present an **existential strategic
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the involved parties. [[Escalation
arising from inadvertence or miscalc]{.mark}ulation [is **easier to
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}, owing to the realities of operating in a
maritime environment. 7 At an operational level, [it is [easier to
achieve **controlled deescalation**]{.mark} at sea than on
land]{.underline}. [The [options to use **new** weapons]{.mark} systems
[or attack new]{.mark} types of [targets]{.mark} (**vertical
escalation**) [are limited, and **geographic expansion**]{.mark} of the
area of conflict (**horizontal escalation**) [is
**unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 8

[[**De-escalation** after an incident is facilitated by the fact that
the sea cannot be **controlled permanently**, so]{.mark} the [costs of
withdrawal are reduced]{.mark}, as [such a move does not result]{.mark}
automatically [in the **loss of territory**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Further, [the size of the maritime environment, coupled with the speed

is needed to concentrate often-dispersed maritime forces. [Organic
escalation therefore is **less likely** to occur]{.mark}]{.underline},
since political and military elites would be required to commit
expensive assets intentionally to continue a clash. Equally, information
gathering also is hindered by the nature of operations at sea. Time
often is required to ascertain facts fully, and this gap allows for
political and strategic tensions to cool.
